2020-07-16 18:29:39,you can bet this same biz is hot here in the states.
2020-07-16 18:48:26,Very interesting. But did he put his visor up or did the Batallion in the front row do it for him?
2020-07-16 21:20:40,"""Bangladeshi law enforcement officials said that Mr. Shahed had been investigated in more than 30 other criminal cases connected to corruption, embezzlement and running fraudulent companies. He has served two years in prison, the authorities said. “He is a known criminal,” said Faizul Islam, a member of Bangladesh’s elite police unit, the Rapid Action Battalion.""
- but that apparently was no obstacle to him running a hospital! I would imagine that there was more going on at that place than just selling fake COVID-19 certificates!"
2020-07-16 18:42:47,"Besides you can buy a jenuine Covid 19 negative/positive both certificat, which you need. just pay 45 to 50 USD. Really superb businesse,  and Bangladesh is the country where everything is possible"
2020-07-16 22:53:33,Trust is probably the most important thing in business and economic success. By faking certificates this poor country Bangladesh may lose a lot more then foreign remittance.
2020-07-16 22:15:11,"One key fact is missing in this article, it's the fact that people were duped into getting the false report. Genuine patients as well as migrant workers paid that amount to be tested and get genuine diagnostic reports instead had fallen victim to the scam without even knowing that the report they had in hands were fake.  And the scammers did it because it's cheaper and more profitable to just print reports without tests. This  bit of information is crucial to understand that just because someone is covid positive with contradictory report in her/his hand doesn't mean s/he bought that report to dupe the authority rather according to most of the cases that person her/himself is the victim."
2020-07-17 06:11:30,"This is false and fabricated news. This article has been written intentionally to show world community so that they do not allow Bangladeshi workers to their country. 
This accused person did not sale certificate to the workers. This culprit gave false test report without any kind of test.

This Indian's intention is clear."
2020-07-17 09:43:14,I don't find the validity of a news report regarding Bangladesh when it has been published with a New Delhi correspondence.
2020-07-17 19:08:15,"Bangladesh received 18.34 billion USD as remittance from its migrant workers last year. The government earned 2,000,000 USD on average every hour from these workers and sent the equivalent amount in local Bangladeshi currency, TAKA to their families with no problems.  Over 10 million Bangladeshis work as migrant workers.

Just one Shahid doesn’t change Bangladesh’s success story as one of the top remittance earners on the planet."
2020-07-21 14:05:21,"That some--not all--Covid-19 patients can be treated at home is game-changing. This gives the patient the comfort of being at home, reduces the chances of catching the virus or other diseases while in the hospital, and frees up ICU rooms for more serious cases.

At age 79 I am at very high risk of serious illness or even death if I contract the virus, so I have been following virus research closely. I am a psychologist, not an MD, but I am trained and experienced at reading and interpreting scientific research.
 
Reports of very high death rates (75-80%!) for intubated, elderly Covid-19 patients led me to have a long conversation with my Cleveland Clinic doctor, who supported my changing my health care directive to include the text:  Do not intubate except as a last resort. Aside from being associated with death if carried out on Covid-19 patients, intubation may cause cognitive deficits, compromise various organs and exacerbate pre-existing conditions.

So, it possible to treat some Covid-19 cases at home, and there are several steps that can be taken at home or in hospital before implementing the extreme measure of intubation. These include proning (laying the patient on his side or front, which eases breathing), and administering supplemental oxygen through a nose tube or mask.

As I am not an MD I cannot offer medical advice; however, I do advise those with concerns and issues similar to mine to discuss them with a health care provider."
2020-07-21 15:47:21,"Care of patients should be done in stages. If you have a mild to moderate case, supplemental oxygen delivered to the home with a machine is a first step. Prescription of anti-blood clotting drugs should be provided. Daily consultation with a team should be done. If the patient progresses to a moderate case, then IV fluids and other care can still be provided in the home with nurse visits to administer the fluids and do blood draws. If the patient needs more care, then, and only then, should they be transported to the ED for more intensive care. This would not be an easy system to develop but might ease overrun ICU units at the hospital."
2020-07-21 17:04:26,Having managed many patients I think we can say we know much more about the disease that we can safely manage some very sick patients at home. Indeed we did manage some of my colleagues who got sick using telemedicine. If we have enough oxygen supplies and monitoring devices and a nurse to visit when needed some of the care could be even better at home. During the big surge modified units in hospitals were not really optimal for patient care and with the proper setup you could do better care at home. Germany has been doing it for awhile and now some of the Asian countries with inadequate beds are doing the same.
2020-07-21 17:07:05,I hope to avoid the virus and I plan to become part of the army of vaccinators that will be needed when the time comes. In the meantime if I’m struck down with COVID-19 I hope to ride it out at home. This is so encouraging!
2020-07-21 17:12:43,"If there are shortages of nurses, I don't understand how there are enough nurses for home care?"
2020-07-21 13:47:40,fantastic story another feather in the cap of Northwell Health They are one of the hospital systems we are lucky to have in New York State
2020-07-21 17:04:58,"Yes! A wonderful idea/strategy! It has been done in Germany with excellent results and it's not only good for hospitals but for us, the patients as well!!! I hope Kaiser in San Diego follows this strategy! When I read what is going in hospitals, suddenly I feel like the commercial: the cockroaches motel: the come in but don't come out!"
2020-07-21 17:42:04,"Remarkable that an enormous hospital system like Northwell (I think they are the largest non government employer in NYS) is able to be so agile and adaptable.

The patient gets professional and appropriate care at home.  The hospital retains capacity for critically ill patients and a combination of nurse managers and tele-health provides the appropriate regimen for wellness.

This is a model which can be exported to other parts of the country suffering the current tsunami of cases.."
2020-07-21 18:52:49,Great - now this gives Trump and other Covidiots further ammunition for their stupid anti-mask crusade.
2020-07-21 19:40:20,Florida should be making preparations to convert The Villages into one very large Covid-19 care center.
2020-07-21 19:57:18,"I personally know about Northwell Health’s excellent Home Care program because I was one of its patients. 

My husband got the coronavirus.  He had to be hospitalized and placed on a ventilator.  At that time, approximately 80% of patients on ventilators did not survive.

When I got the coronavirus, I call my Northwell Health Primary Care Physician.  She called me 4-5 times a day every day until I got better.  She had a Northwell Health Nurse Facetime me every day.  I had a blood pressure monitor, a pulse oximeter, and a digital thermometer at home, so there was no need for someone to come to my home to take my vitals.

My Primary Care Physician sent me a portable oxygen tank in the middle of the night.  Thanks to my Primary Care Physician and the Nurses, I was able to recover from the coronavirus without being hospitalized.  They are my Superheros as are all other healthcare providers.  I hope you can hear me banging my pots and pans for all healthcare providers.

The coronavirus is far worse than the flu.  It feels like someone is tightly squeezing your lungs, and it hurts every time you cough, which is often.

Please get a pulse oximeter to check whether you or your loved ones are getting sufficient oxygen.  If you are not getting sufficient oxygen, you need to get to the hospital promptly.

Please wear a face mask when outside of your own home to protect yourself from others, and to protect others from you.  We can stop the coronavirus from spreading if we work together."
2020-07-21 21:43:12,"I’m already set up. As a retired doc with critical care experience, I know a CPAP machine with inline Oxygen is “half” of a ventilator. I own a pulse ox, home O2 concentrator, and am wondering whether to buy aspirin as clot prevention (yes). I know to make myself keep drinking so I void every 4 hours at least. And prone. And blow balloons up for lung exercise.

I was appalled at the rush to ventilate people but understood it. However, our airways have  has incredible reflexes that a vent overrides. I read of good results in China with people in CPAP rigs that look like their head is in a water cooler bottle.
 
Early oxygen gently delivered seems a no brainer. Remember oxygen bars? I’d set them up in assisted living to tide people over. 

Of course, when I share this with modern docs, the look at me like I’m nuts. Evidenced-based care is great, but I a lifetime of experience is also helpful. Yes, yes, I know not to treat myself,  but Geez we make getting care way too hard and way too dangerous."
2020-07-21 23:04:50,"This article is positive and encouraging. Yet, we are once again expecting people who are very sick, and very frightened, and possibly alone, to efficiently organize their own health care needs."
2020-07-22 00:57:18,Too bad Florida didn’t put any effort into prevention.
2020-07-22 03:20:34,"I’m not surprised by this. I firmly believe my wife and I had this before it was named in January into February. Our Dr immediately put us on prednisone to help with inflammation and breathing along with inhalers. I think if we had been diagnosed a month later, we would’ve been taken to a hospital in the thick of this. Home healthcare is the way to go."
2020-07-22 02:35:53,"The UK has ‘’Hospital at Home’ for seriously ill patients who are long term. I saw it with mr brother. Amazing. No idea if they used it for Covid. Nurses have a lot of equipment in their cars, and a doctor is on call with them. Saved him weeks in hospital."
2020-07-18 16:31:54,"My brother contracted polio in 1954. If NIH signs off on a vaccine, I'll get it asap. The risk of harm by contracting COVID-19 is greater than the risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. It seems too many people confuse a choice of being a a ""no-brainer"" with having no brain."
2020-07-18 16:32:20,"If there’s a vaccine, I’ll get in line. But it won’t be the front of the line. Too much urgency here."
2020-07-18 16:32:54,"We also need more antibody studies to see if a vaccine will work, or if the immunity will wear off."
2020-07-18 16:36:36,"While it is sad that some children have had negative reactions to vaccines, those relatively few cases should not put millions at risk, which would be the effect if anti-vaxxers had their way about the MMR shots. The unvaccinated few generally avoided measles etc because the majority got their shots. We’ve already seen how quickly measles can spread in a community with unscientific objections to vaccines."
2020-07-18 16:32:05,"When Dr. Fauci says GO.
I GO."
2020-07-18 16:35:50,We’ll get it ASAP! And we’ll avoid anyone who doesn’t. I’ve seen polio victims (including a child in 1980’s) and a woman die from chicken pox during her pregnancy. Ignorance isn’t bliss.
2020-07-18 16:37:01,"Why are these buffoons not being dispersed, fined, or arrested for violating the mask ordinance? Permitting them to be there sends a dangerous message: it emboldens their inane delusions and weakens the governor's ordinance. Zero tolerance, please, Gov. Newsom!"
2020-07-18 16:39:17,"Anti-vaccine people are listened to mainly, because in contrast to their views, vaccines work.  If we still had memories of polio, not many of those anti-vaccine people would be so opposed to polio vaccines.  They don't remember mass deaths from flu, from polio, from other diseases.  So they can have their beliefs free from fear of the diseases.

Same will happen with Covid-19.  The people who get the vaccine will stay alive, be able to return to work, be safe going to bars, their children will be safe going back to school, they can have neighbors over, their can attend church, etc.

And the anti-vaccine people will continue to get sick and die.  

That will end the anti-vaccine talk.  People have to be hit over the head with why they should be vaccinated, and no amount of ""education"" about misinformation will work."
2020-07-18 16:40:38,"If those who are skeptical of vaccines DO NOT accept the help a vaccine offers then they maintain a higher risk of becoming infected and suffering due to COVID-19 - AND possibly infecintg those they love and care for, and maybe dying. And, oh by the way, they risk infecting or being infected by the other skeptics in their gatherings without even a mask. Those who have the vaccination and maintain their good health will then take care of them w.r.t. their physical condition. Not sure what we can do about their rational powers, though! It is understandable if there are those who have had bad (possibly really bad) results with vaccines and are therefore reluctant to accept the health benefits vs. risks of the new vaccine.  We have seen no numbers published on this, only anecdotes it would appear. But it is  a social choice that has risks either way and an informed public will, I believe, risk on the side of getting the vaccine eventually and thankfully!!"
2020-07-18 16:42:05,"Several of the protesters' placards in today's NYT photo (7/18/20) make harsh and serious claims against vaccines and alleged damages that they attribute to them. Others in the crowd may be supporters of the belief that a well-known tech titan is using his support for vaccines as a ruse to 'chip' them, so that they can be tracked and controlled. It looks like and reads of a low-budget dystopian thriller served up with a tossed paranoia salad. These images, the placards, and the ocean of putatively scientific ""proof"" of their claims do little but provide a shoddy foundation on which one could popularly call for the abolition of entities and funding for all public health measures ... because such are incorrect. This, not Seattle, not New York, not anywhere else in post-Floyd America is mob rule. And the mob does not mask."
2020-07-18 16:43:18,"This is tough. I am a logical, fact appreciative person. I value and support vaccinations. I also acknowledge that there have been problem with some vaccines and the mega profit driven nature of medical corporations have some history of ethical shortcomings. There is also a climate of denial of any problems of any vaccines. I am not talking about things like the completely debunked autism theories. But, because of the fringe conspiracy theory folks, anybody who has any hesitation for any vaccine for any reason is now deemed a lunatic. And that can be a problem for proper evaluation of any new product-including new drugs and vaccines. Given the rushed nature of all of the stages of testing, I do and will have concerns about a vaccine. I think every logical person must. That does not mean I would not get vaccinated, but it does mean that I will weigh the risk at such time one is available against my (and my community) risk of covid-19."
2020-07-18 16:43:34,"In grade school I had a classmate who contracted polio and walks with the aid of two aluminum crutches that supported her legs.  She could not have gone far too if it were not for her sister assisting her by her side.
Yes, I know that there are risks to a vaccine, but it is the lies and misinformation that is doing the most harm.
I see protesters on their feet holding anti-vaccine signs, and the irony is without the polio vaccine some would not be on their two feet without some type of aid."
2020-07-18 16:44:36,"In order to help protect your community you must first protect yourself. One cannot give what one does not have. Look anywhere, this is always the way. One cannot give life if one doesn’t have life already. So, everyone must consider for themselves first what is best for me in order so I may give to others."
2020-07-18 16:47:22,I’m reading that antibodies disappear after a few months so that immunity may not be possible.
2020-07-18 16:47:30,"I am by no means an anti-vaxxer but I don’t trust the Trump administration to put out a safe and adequately tested vaccine.  They are rushing it and we all know Trump’s disdain for regulations.  They will skip all the safety tests.  They’re going to just rush it to market so Trump can brag that he has “fixed” the crisis.  This vaccine is about Trump’s re-election, not public health.  If something that normally takes years suddenly gets done in months, I’m suspicious.  No Trump vaccine for me!"
2020-07-18 16:48:45,"If you want to take a vaccine that has bypassed phases of clinical trials, by all means do so.  You will protect yourself from the many who will refuse."
2020-07-18 16:49:51,"Another example of ""American Exceptionalism"". The anti-vax movement is barely a blip in the rest of the civilized world. That would be due to governments recognizing the importance and apolitical nature of science."
2020-07-18 16:50:13,"The media can't divorce itself from contributing to the concern many have about the perceived hastiness behind the development of a C-19 virus.  In the course of reporting on the development of a vaccine they have (rightfully) described the normal timeline to be years rather than months; they have reported on a president eager to make a vaccine a political win, and they have described drug companies motivated by prestige and profit to be first to market. Don't recall reading anything where altruism was the centerpiece of the story. So yeah, I'll wait my turn; won't be rushing to be vaccinated."
2020-07-18 16:57:59,"I always stay up-to-date on my vaccinations.  However I'm wary of anything the Trump administration touts. Without transparency I cannot tell if a vaccine has been adequately tested and whether it is safe. I look at the Trump administration's treatment of scientists, science, the CDC, etc. and rewriting of guidelines. I don't trust them a bit with my life."
2020-07-18 16:59:48,There would be two type of mistrust. One from those who generally oppose all vaccines and another from those suspicious of its safety - Trump opponents who think an unsafe vaccine was pushed to impact the elections.
2020-07-18 17:01:00,"I'd like to see a civil discussion between anti-vaccine proponents and a group of scientists who are also excellent communicators where each side brings their ""facts"" to the discussion. There will be a point at which the anti-vaccine folks reveal themselves as science deniers, embracing misinformation."
2020-07-18 17:01:38,"Like my mother always used to say, “Fast and wrong.”  I am a strong proponent of vaccines that have been properly developed, but there’s too much political pressure pushing COVID vaccines to market.  I will be very suspicious of any vaccine that comes out before the originally- suggested time frame of 12-18 months."
2020-07-18 17:02:02,"Let’s assume there is a vaccine, and that we’ll be able to know whether it has been approved and safety certified by other nations as well as our own FDA and CDC.  Media, that’s something you can help with if you want to continue to matter to the rational part of the population.

Under those circumstances it should be quickly established via an easily verifiable form of vaccine certification who is able to:
- attend school
- go to public indoor spaces without a mask
- purchase an airline ticket
- gain entry to other countries
- etc.
People without vaccination verification would not be allowed to do these things.
Those who choose to cut themselves off from society are welcome to do so.  They have that freedom of choice, but private businesses and government policy are both free to protect the best interests of society by excluding them from various activities.
I would expect nothing less from a sane nation."
2020-07-18 17:02:29,"The scientific community is by nature skeptical.  It is always about proof.  We should reserve our judgement about the hasty nature of these vaccine trials until they are over and can be reviewed dispassionately by the investigators' peers.  When there's a consensus among those scientists, we should all accept that and do the right thing.  No individual lay person, no matter how informed by the media they may be, is in a position to make a valid assessment of the science.  Getting your information from CNN, Fox, or OANN will never put you in a position to ""make informed decisions for my family."""
2020-07-18 17:04:08,"I have no use for the traditional anti-vaccination crowd, but I certainly understand people being wary with the Trump administration overseeing the operation."
2020-07-18 17:06:01,"The sight of Covid-19 patients dying in intensive care just days after they laughed in the face of a virus they considered a hoax is enough to get me to wear a mask now, and to get vaccinated as soon as a vaccine has been authorized by the FDA and had its safety verified by responsible, professional sources of drug information."
2020-07-18 17:07:01,"Easily dealt with: legally require everyone to be vaccinated, regardless of any excuse otherwise. It is like rationing during wartime -- strictly necessary"
2020-07-18 17:09:00,"I believe in education. The government should release a series of TV commercials whose aim is to educate the public about 
the benefits and risks of vaccination.   There are people who are still living today who contracted polio before the vaccine was developed.  Historical figures such as FDR also were impacted by polio.  Educational commercials should also include and educate the public about the speed of transmission of infectious disease.   Most Americans for example do not understand the concept of exponential growth.     Anti-vaxers need to understand that vaccination has the potential to free the world of the scourge that is Covid 19."
2020-07-18 17:09:01,Nothing is likely to change as long as politicians and experts fail to agree on anything. Don't blame the people. They are just responding to the absence of agreement.
2020-07-18 17:03:54,"An effective vaccine will be developed in spite of - not because of - Trump's wishes.  Heck, who doesn't want an effective vaccine sooner than later?

Trump will ALWAYS claim credit for anything positive because that's what a raging narcissist like him does.  In his deranged and self-absorbed mind, he probably thinks sunrises happen upon his command.

That said, I will get the vaccine when someone with credibility, integrity, and well-established and impartial scientific standing advises to do so."
2020-07-18 17:09:43,"I love to travel.  I’ve been to Madagascar - Morocco - Myanmar and many “exotic” locales.  I not only ask my doctor what “should” I get when i go someplace but what “could” I get.  I have my Hep A, B, C, yellow fever, typhoid, regular updates to my tetanus, just had both my shingles vaccinations last year.   I believe in science and that vaccinations have kept us healthy and safe.  BUT... I don’t believe THIS administration cares that we are safe or will safely monitor the necessary companies and agencies working on the vaccine or testing the vaccine.  I want a vaccine for this, I want to travel again and feel protected, BUT....  we need time and independent reviews.   That won’t happen with a president who only cares about himself."
2020-07-18 17:10:55,"It’s way too early to be making predictions about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine.

When one gains approval, we’ll have to see what it went through to get there and decide if that was adequate.

I am personally dubious of anything that Trump says or does. The right thing to do is ignore whatever he says about the vaccine and make your own decision based on either the science if you understand it or the recommendation of trustworthy experts(not anti-vaccine quacks) if you don’t."
2020-07-18 17:02:58,"Trump's anti-science administration has moved many in his science denying base into the arms of the anti-vaxxer community.

When a safe therapeutic or vaccine becomes available, there will be millions who will refuse, endangering the rest of us.

Only Trump can make the health and safety of the American people a political, anti-science football.  After all, he is a ""stable genius""."
2020-07-18 17:08:16,"Whoever wants to take the eventual vaccine takes it, let the rest deal with the virus on their own terms. Let’s see who will be the winners."
2020-07-18 17:11:04,"I assume the Trump administration will be gone by the time a vaccine will be ready for testing and/or distribution, so people will be able to rely on scientific input more than political expediency.  More important:  if the vaccine works, those who refuse to take it will have only themselves to blame as Mr. Darwin once again prevails."
2020-07-18 16:46:05,"Novavax is a company that never delivered a vaccine in 33 years of its existence, and was about to go bankrupt. Then it suddenly got $1.6 billion from the Trump administration, for fast-track development of a vaccine that bypasses the scrutiny of government scientists.

This was covered on this very site: ""How a Struggling Company Won $1.6 Billion to Make a Coronavirus Vaccine"".

Excuse me, in case I am skeptical, if three days before the election Novavax announces that they have or almost have the vaccine ready to go. 

The media, of course, will trip over itself to unwittingly become part of the last greatest con in American history - which would be our last."
2020-07-18 17:03:09,"Me, I’m just going to watch the Europeans. When Angela Merkel says, “use THIS vaccine, that’s when I’ll go ahead."

2020-07-18 17:02:36,"If a ""vaccine"" is released before November 2, I will not get it, and I'm as ""pro"" vaccine as a person can be. Trump has touted all sorts of miracle cures that end up killing people. If one shows up before the election, stay far far away. 

Of course, listen to your doctor, not me. But *anything* Trump has ever tried to sell anyone has been fraudulent or outright dangerous."
2020-07-18 17:13:23,"Sadly anti-vaxxers have been around before Trump, and they transcend political parties. On the right they have put on conspiracy hats and think it’s a new world order conducted by Bill Gates to inject 5G into are veins. The left at times go on about big pharma like Abbott and Pfizer to preaching natural methods like oils and reject medical science. Not everyone on each side fit in this, but the crazy fringes are sometimes on different sides of the same coin."
2020-07-18 17:13:23,"I’m not an anti vaxxer by any stretch. But I am concerned that, in America, something will be rushed to market for political purposes. Trump’s mendacity, coupled with his pattern of installing sycophants to run government agencies, could create a pathway for a flawed vaccine to be approved without proper testing and rushed to market. Trump is desperate to improve his poll numbers and would do anything to look like the savior before the election. I will wait for science to prove a vaccine is safe and effective before partaking."
2020-07-18 17:04:57,"The perfect vaccine would cure everyone, and sadly that isn't the case.  We aren't yet t the point in medicine where we have designer medicines for each known gene type of human, geared to each person's own DNA, RNA and other factors, that is where we hope to get.  Yet not being there yet doesn't mean we stop all vaccines, or medicines being taken.  

Fast tracking the current batches of vaccines to help the world with Covid-19 has it's risks, as does having no vaccine at all.  While I know there have been issues in the past, helping the planet get over a deadly serious virus is a must.  Even if some people won't want to take a vaccine for it.  It's a risk that 8 billion people will have to take, in order to protect as many as possible.

Trump might be a bane for the cure of the USA,  Yet he isn't the only world leader, we are only a small fraction of t he world and until we start thinking as a whole planet, we will be doomed to fight like babies on it.  Grow Up you Humans."

2020-07-18 17:14:16,"Unfortunately, I would hesitate to try any vaccine that was rushed through the clinical trial process in time to be released under a Trump administration.   We have seen how the Trump administration at all levels politicizes and manipulates scientific and medical information (e.g. hydroxychloroquine's approval as a ""game changer"").  If you want to vaccinate a couple of hundred million people without killing or injuring many thousands, you need to take the time to get it right."

2020-07-18 17:15:17,"Before I get a COVID19 vaccination, I want to know how safe it is (after the 2nd shot, if there are 2 shots) for my age group, as well as its effectiveness to prevent or ameliorate the disease in my age group.  I also want to know how safe and effective it is if combined with a better vaccine when that comes out, perhaps a few months later.  Finally, I want to know how long the vaccine is effective.  If it’s only effective for a short but indeterminate time, how am I going to go about living a pre-COVID life?  If I’m going to still have to wear a mask and divorce myself from other humans what’s the point of taking it?
Just because the CDC, FDA, Dr. Fauci, the Republican administration, and hungry businesses want to push a hastily produced vaccine on us, doesn’t mean its ultimately safe. I’m not going to take their word for it this time.  I don’t like how so many people that are involved in this have either made serious mistakes because they didn’t know enough about the disease to recommend something (we’re safe at this time, no we’re not; masks aren’t necessary, yes they are, etc), or because they’re afraid of going against what Trump wants.
Finally, remember Thalidomide?  I don’t think that today we have a Francis Kelsey in the FDA to protect us."
2020-07-18 17:16:17,"This is not about creating a better marketing campaign for the vaccine. This is about the fact that it is not possible to ensure efficacy, much less safety, in such a short time period. I would say that any vaccine that's availabe at the end of the year or even two years from now will not have been appropriately tested. This has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with facts."
2020-07-18 17:16:35,"My children are fully vaccinated. We get flu shots every year.  We are not in a high risk group for covid-19, although we have elderly family members.  We wear masks when we leave the house. We have avoided large groups of people. However, I am wary of a vaccine that would make it to market so quickly. I would need assurance from scientists I trust regarding the safety of the vaccine."
2020-07-18 16:58:02,"This is a very disheartening article. In the 21st century in the US ignorance and lack of faith in science abounds. Any one not in a high risk category will have to wait to get a vaccine any how. So most people will not be in the first wave. Hopefully when their turn comes they will do the right thing for them and their families and get vaccinated. As some one who grew up during the polio epidemic, our working class parents and all Americans took their families to the vaccination centers as soon as they could. Today we have supposedly mode educated people but some of them are simply still ignorant. Once it becomes apparent there is a significant number that are so ignorant and selfish the will not get vaccinated, then sanctions will start. No vaccination? You are now quarantined. Period. Kanye West? Mark of the beast? Wow. Not just ignorant. Stupid. Flat earth as well? Methinks there is a lot of overlap in such thinking....."

But I'm not in any rush.  Turns out my life is pretty sweet isolated here in the woods.  So I can afford to be at the end of the line.  Let those who MUST be out get protected first, I can wait patiently.

Please notice just because I'm not champing at the bit to get a shot, I am not a brainless idiot.  I know not being vaccinated means I must stick to my once-per-three-week scuba outings, but I am very willing and able to do so.

I will get the shot.  But you first."
2020-07-18 16:38:04,"Given the current administration's lying, ineptitude,  and lack of transparency (not to mention our great leader's advice that we inject bleach), of course people won't trust the first vaccine out of the gate: let someone else be a guinea pig."

They rarely have informed reasons to skip their child's vaccines.  The do however understand deep down that their child benefits from the herd immunity created by other parents efforts to protect their own children.
I doubt such a vaccine will be ready before November 3rd, but I don't doubt that one will be touted by the soon to be outgoing president."

However, there are clouds certain to dim this shimmering light. Trump may hastily push something that Dr. Fauci will question the efficacy of. Or, Fauci may endorse a vaccine that Trump doesn’t, and here we go. I am curious if Sauk, or any of the other vaccine pioneers faced such a political gauntlet in their days?  Regardless, it is a shame it has become so politicized that the urgency to get the population vaccinated, and the effectiveness of a vaccine itself, will be studied and tried on social media, editorial Cable news, and in America’s streets, rather in the corridors of science and medical technology. We will be judged, socially and politically, on our personal positions on the coming vaccine and whether or not we were administered a dose."

2020-07-18 17:35:15,"The stakes are indeed extremely high in several ways.  One, that is perhaps unique to the US, is the underlying visible anti-vaccination ""sentiment"" among enough number of people.  As some quotes in the article say, mishandling of this new vaccine project could dramatically enhance such sentiment and perhaps does lasting damage to public health policy in the US.  Yet, the challenge of developing vaccines quickly, based on the most advanced scientific knowledge and techniques that are being applied, would deliver a huge prize if it is successful.  The long standing norm of ""vaccines, safe and effective, would take ten years to develop"", would be successfully challenged and our confidence  in more modern approaches to vaccine development would rise to a new level (from almost zero).  

As others point out, the safety and effectiveness of any vaccines would be first screened by many regulators in the world.  In my view that is not much more than FDA screening in the US as these screening agencies borrow each other's results quite often.  I do not, unfortunately, trust the Chinese effort much.  Their interim reporting on the development of vaccines (there are many in China) is so incomplete and selective.  The more recent findings that antibodies may not last long enough is a big concern.  Multiple shots with multiple vaccines may be what awaits us."
2020-07-18 17:35:19,"I'm not getting the hype over a vaccine. How effective are flu shots ? Look at the world map. Most countries on the planet have battled this virus fairly successfully. How ? By doing what needed to be done, By isolating, by shutting down, by contact tracing. By putting the health of the whole above the comfort of the individual. All the things that Americans refuse to do. We just can't have the government telling us what to do. Usurping our 'rights'. While the rest of the world gets back to pre- COVID life, Americans will be waiting around for a silver bullet.Sad how far we've slid in a very short time."
2020-07-18 17:37:06,"Looking at the recalcitrance positively, when all’s said and done, we will only have to be burdened by a smaller number of them next year.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing and we won’t have to produce as much vaccine as predicted.

That said, if Trump administration appointees are the sole deciders...I, too, will have some hesitation if the attitude of ‘What have you got to lose?’ prevails."
2020-07-18 17:37:33,"Are we hoping for a miracle or a vaccine? Why does a normal safe and effective vaccine take 3-4 years to develop, but not this one? Why should we waste those additional years for the next new vaccine?"
2020-07-18 17:38:15,"Quite frankly, my thoughts are not preocuppied with those who may not want a vaccine that has been properly developed.  Yes, start preparing to deal with those who are skeptical but attention should not be diverge from creating the vaccine.  In the grand scheme of things, vaccine doubters are not my main concern.  I want this vaccine as soon as possible.  When it is here and if people still don't want to take it then their well being is their concern.  Fortunately, the vaccine will make the possibility of such people spreading the disease a moot point.  They will be the only casualties."
2020-07-18 17:40:03,"How about we get an article that does science and data instead of hyperbole.

First off how about an understanding of the difference between vaccination and immunization. 

Next up how about some detailed reportage on the how's and why's of the normal time frame it takes for any vaccine to go through efficacy and safety trials.

Then let's get a scientific discussion on the potential risks of mRNA vaccines.

Now let's ask why it is that the vulnerable group is not the study group being used for Moderna's vaccine tests. Average age across the world of those who died from Covid is 80 plus. The mortality risk for those under 45 is effectively 0. Why aren't they using that at-risk group in their trials? Pretty easy to speculate about that. Why would there be cause to vaccinate anyone who is at 0 risk? 

And what were the precise results from Modderna's first trials? Not very good folks- if you want the link to that study let me know. 

Now why would those in the forefront of this latest vaccine push be demanding indemnity- Gates specifically called for this months ago. Shouldn't they be held liable for any damages t just like any other business?

The amount of unwarranted hysteria in the American public is a sight to see. Articles such as this, which is just another sales pitch and not science, are in part responsible for creating such a climate of ignorance and fear.

Folks need to wake up quick to who is in charge- it isn't your precious Blue or Red Teams."
2020-07-18 17:41:39,"I think it's worth remembering that nothing is ""rushed"" yet. It could be six months, it could be five years. Trump can squawk all he wants, but luckily the scientists are doing the actual work."

We can enter a los decade similar to what Japan endured but fir different reasons entirely

We can wait it out til President Joe Biden & those with cred take helm

Or we can’t ascertain for ourselves the efficacy of a vaccine, no matter the source. THis is NOT, nor should it become a political debate. 

If so, we will surely travel the dichotomous  choice road to to doing nothing , a truly awful. American reactions.this is a nuanced d choice , one best left to us as individuals , with good leadership. We are obviously missing the latter, but I am willing to have independent verification of the vaccine’s efficacy guide my decision.

2020-07-18 17:45:33,"The byline blames the distrust of hopefully coming vaccines on the rapid timetable and on Trump ""cheer leading"".

I agree that the rapid timetable does breed distrust that the safety of a vaccine has truly been established.

But I disagree that Trump's cheer leading is a factor.  That is just a partisan accusation that the Times could not resist adding.  If some Democrat were president who cheer led rapid development of a vaccine, the same distrust would occur because of the rapid development.  But the Times would never attribute the distrust to the Democrat president's cheer leading.  In fact, the Times would probably praise the Democrat president for his role to push the rapid development."

We have to live with it, period."
2020-07-18 17:50:55,"""The researchers said that a national promotional strategy should be in the planning stages as soon as possible."" Given the Trump's administration's record, I'm not holding my breath on that one. I have not seen any strategy on anything. Trump seems like a pinball machine, ricocheting from one matter to the next, one position to the next, without any clear objective.

I have heard Anthony Fauci try to reassure television audiences that any vaccine that is approved for mass distribution will be safe and effective, but he is not the one who will ultimately give final approval. The FDA, which unfortunately has its own problems with approval of faulty antibody test kits, should be publicly, at press conferences and on the Sunday talk shows, explaining in detail how the vaccine is being developed and all of the safety measures being taken."
2020-07-18 17:50:57,"Trump's credibility is zero.  He has pushed at least two false remedies, and one of them lined his own pockets.  

Before I accept a vaccine, I will need to know more about who profits from it, and what steps were expedited, and is it accepted by the scientific community?  I have been very, very careful - isolating myself, wearing a mask, maintaining cleanliness - for my benefit and the benefit of the high-risk people whom I love.  I am not going to leap to risk anything, without more information.  

As much as I want a vaccine, I value my life too much to rely on the current administration, which has made it clear that my life means absolutely nothing to them."
2020-07-18 17:55:03,One should always listen to peoples concerns.  The need to get a vaccine as quickly as possible is also a desired outcome.  People have been prey to vaccine misinformation.  It isn't limited to one group.  The measles vaccine was wrongly linked to autism.  Social media has magnified the spread of misinformation to a dangerous extent.  Certainly a rush to produce a vaccine against the corona virus has been hurt by the drive to derive vast profits from it.  Profiteering on Wall Street increases the fears of a rush to the public.
2020-07-18 17:58:38,"I absolutely understand being skeptical of anything pushed by Trump, but Trump doesn't make the vaccines and he isn't the only source of information. Go to www.clinicaltrials.gov to read about the trials yourself if you're concerned. The FDA withdrew emergency authorization of hydroxychloroquine because it didn't work, despite Trump staking so much on it, and I don't think they'll be bullied into approving a worthless or dangerous vaccine.  Recruitment has begun for phase 3 trials that will involve tens of thousands of people. Smaller trials have already been completed for safety purposes. The timeline being rushed may, I suppose, mean that something gets brought to market before they know how long the vaccination is good for, and they may not be certain exactly how effective it is because they won't be intentionally exposing anyone to the virus. But I looked at the screening questions myself because I was considering volunteering; many of the questions involve how much you are around other people, so I assume they want people with at least moderate exposure so that they don't reach the false conclusion that ""this rock keeps tigers away"" by testing on people who have quarantined themselves. Studies will continue after vaccines are in use. I think this should be enough. There should be enough science behind it for us to not have to take Trump's word for it. I'm pretty skeptical, though, that many of us will have to make this decision while he's in office."
2020-07-18 17:59:32,"I am an adamantly pro-vaccine mother and all my kids get them regularly, but as a biomedical professional, I will not allow any of my family members to receive a COVID-19 vaccine unless it has been vetted for many years. Even the fastest-produced vaccines have required at least 5 years, and attempts to rush or ""fast-track"" them in the past--notably for RSV and dengue fever--have had catastrophic consequences, killing and injuring thousands of kids and adults and building a well of permanent mistrust. 

Appeals to headstarts in development miss why vaccines inevitably take a long time to get right. The development is the comparatively easy part. The time lag is because vaccines are given to healthy people, not sick patients, and there is very little margin for error in an area that is very error-prone. Vaccines aren't drugs--they're stimuli for our complex, still poorly-understood immune systems, and it takes many years to fully ascertain the unanticipated effects, unknown interactions with physiological components and other infectious agents, to make them safe. The rushed dengue vaccine had impeccable early results before it was found to actually potentiate fatal infection, and an HIV vaccine candidate would have itself recombined and led to AIDS in millions of people. We've already learned that COVID-19 antibodies wane quickly and people are getting re-infected, meaning boosters would likely be necessary. For such multiple immunizations, great caution and time are necessary."
2020-07-18 18:00:21,This is fine.  Never mind herd immunity.  I will take the vaccine and be protected for at least a year when I will take a booster if needed.  Those who are vaccine skeptics are free to not take the shot and catch the disease.
2020-07-18 17:27:57,"Unfortunately, the current administration is making it hard for even strong pro-vaccine citizens to feel safe taking a COVID vaccine rushed through the process. I don't think it will be tested long and widely enough to ensure safety and efficacy.  It's all about money and image now - who will be the first to bring it to market and make the big $$. I would be more willing to take a EU-approved vaccine."
2020-07-18 17:49:15,"There is one single fraudulent paper that was withdrawn falsely claiming the link between vaccines and autism. There is a vast body of clinical data collected by hundreds of independent academic scientists around the globe proving that the benefits of childhood vaccines far, far outweigh any risks and that the infant mortality rate has decreased globally by 50% since the introduction of these vaccines. 

Anti-vaxxers unknowingly spread lies that can kill innocent children. These people pose an even more immediate risk to the globe than climate change deniers.They all reject peer-reviewed science in favor of conspiracy theory and they cling to their beliefs like religious fundamentalists. Proven facts, truth, the safety and well-being of others appear totally irrelevant to these close-minded people. 

There are also absurd claims of profit motive on the part of Big Pharma Vaccines represent about 2% of their business. These companies would actually make more money if there were more sick non-vaccinated people. 

Any parent who has doubts about the measles vaccine needs to find and read the moving and true account of Roald Dahl's 7 year old daughter's death from measles. Roald Dahl who knows the boundless pain of a lost child urges parents to vaccinate their children.

It is certainly understandable how uninformed parents can fear vaccines.  Widespread public education of the true facts by the media is the best and only way to resolve this tragic anti-vaxxer crisis."
2020-07-18 18:03:25,"My advice:  If you want to be careful, don't accept any vaccine offered, up to and including on Election Day.

2020-07-18 18:08:03,"My first vaccination was for Polio and Smallpox in grade school. Since then all through the military and up to now, I have taken every recommended vaccination. My last vaccination was in the fall for the Flu.  If I don't get vaccinated for COVID-19 it will because I no longer believe anything the Federal Government says. Trump is politicizing all of the health agencies.  If Trump is re-elected he will be President when vaccination becomes available.  How will I know if the vaccination is as advertised by him?"
2020-07-18 18:10:16,"I suggest you watch and see who takes the vaccines. Will those who know most about vaccines - infectious disease specialists, immunologists, and doctors step forward to get the new vaccine? Will their families get the vaccine? 
I think the answer will be yes.
And since many of the comments reference distrust of Trump, let's hope another person will be in the White House and will create a culture of transparency around the vaccine."
2020-07-18 18:11:22,"The real issue is getting a vaccine to those who do want it.  Once that's done, everyone else can do as they please.  

An endorsement from Doctor Trump would be suspect, but let's hear what the real doctors say and see what people in more advanced countries do.  If the vaccine is good enough for the Germans and the Japanese, that's good enough for me."
2020-07-18 18:11:31,"Medical researchers have to get it right, which takes time and due diligence. Trump just wants a vaccine, any vaccine, that might save his Presidency. That's not very reassuring when what we need is THE vaccine.

China is vaccinating people with one that is totally unproven, which has many people nervous. Vaccines are never 100% effective. If a coronavirus vaccine is 75% effective that would be a great achievement. Last year's flu vaccine was deemed 55% effective.

If millions of Americans are refusing even to take basic precautions like face coverings or social distancing, they probably won't get vaccinated either. I am not hopeful going forward. Vaccine or not, this virus will wreak havoc on our country for a long time to come."
2020-07-18 18:16:13,"Project Warp Speed is not about skipping or rushing through steps.  It's about taking the economic risk of taking product and process development steps simultaneously instead of sequentially.   Finding any drug (including vaccines) to be safe and effective requires clinical testing and most fail, so drug companies normally will rationally wait and see for success in one step before sequentially investing in the next step in the process of development all the way to manufacturing.  Project Warp Speed looks to cover the developer's financial risks carrying out overlapping steps to reduce timelines, for example, to invest in large scale manufacturing before safety/efficacy/FDA approval are achieved is normally not financially prudent so the government is subsidizing companies to take this risk.  Ideally, prior to approval, vaccine will be manufactured at risk and large inventory and distribution networks put in place to speedily provide widespread access to the public very soon after the vaccine has been proven safe and effective.  All due care should be taken to assure such safety and efficacy and this should be transparently communicated to the public to achieve a successful vaccine campaign."
2020-07-18 16:36:31,"I used to think the anti-vax movement gained momentum partially because, at least in the US, most of us can't remember a time when small pox, polio, or measles were commonly destroying peoples lives. So we don't have much appreciation for the fact that these vaccines have saved countless lives and prevented tremendous suffering. It almost feels like they're relics of the past.

But now we have covid, so I would have thought that the mass suffering and death would be enough to make people see and value the necessity of vaccination. I guess I was wrong. My faith in our species declines daily."
2020-07-18 16:44:31,"I am a strong proponent of vaccines to date   - well tested, safe -the benefits far out way the risks.  I am leery of a vaccine promoted by the Trump admin - that the levels of risk they will accept will have more to do with politics than public health.  I will be looking for approval from people like Dr Fauci and Dr Paul Offit, not the current FDA.  I also would be uncomfortable with a communications effort at this point in time when we don’t even know what vaccine(s) will be available and the levels of testing communicated and a full disclosure of potential risks. From my perspective, full disclosure along the entire process will help with public acceptance."

2020-07-18 16:37:23,"I strongly feel science-based public education can play a major role in combating such issues. That core promise of American democracy was and still is being systematically destroyed by infusing religious bigotry and teaching in many schools, colleges, and universities, mainly the private ones. It gathered steam mainly after the late 1970s and early 1980s, during the Reagan era and then kept on building due to active support and promotion mainly the Republican party.
Now anti-science public opinion among a worryingly high percentage of American politicians and voters became a huge public health risk as being exposed during this Covid-19 devastation in the US. It's more due to religious and political bigotry than anything else."
2020-07-18 16:57:29,"This was easy to see coming. As a veterinarian I have given tens of thousands of vaccines in my career. As a father my child is currently vaccinated for the diseases that my trusted pediatrician recommends. As a scientist I find myself appalled at the 40 years of linvestment in ignorance by those who would call themselves Republicans (right wing talk radio, underfunding public education, Fox News, etc.) all appropriately capped by the ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency and head of their party.  (which in itself should cause people to question their ideology) The stripping of the expertise in in our government scientific community and the gross promotion of private for profit motivation for any scientific advancement has left me completely skeptical of the safety of any vaccine that might be developed for Covid. I never thought that I would find myself unwilling to be vaccinated when it was in the interest of public health but any decision that I make regarding this will depend on a careful reading of whatever scientific literature and disclosures exist on the evidence for its efficacy and safety. I have no doubt that the various political and financial interests will be buried deeply if not out right concealed so even if the evidence appears trustworthy I will not be anywhere near first in line."
2020-07-18 18:24:59,"After 30 years in public health, I'm deeply skeptical of the altruism gambit. We can't even persuade people to wear a mask to protect others. Take a shot (or two)? Highly doubtful. If, on the other hand, you can't go to work, or school, or church and so on without proof of immunity.... Don't mandate vaccination, but require immunity. Otherwise, we'll never achieve the percentage of the population needed to achieve community immunity."
2020-07-18 17:13:06,"If it can be proven that a vaccine was developed with no animal testing of any kind, then I'll take. Any vaccine based on the suffering of non- human sentient beings is a non-starter for millions of us. A mouse is not ""just a mouse"", he or she is a sentient organism with the same right to life as a living human being.

This will not be known until next year at the earliest. Our experience so far with corona viruses, including SARS-COV-2, and attempts to vaccinate against the most deadly of them, SARS and MERS, has been that the candidates are likely to be effective only for a very short period of time, and that previous vaccine candidates have facilitated rather than protected against the disease. I'm happy to, and have been vaccinated against a whole host of other illnesses, but need positive information about the issues described above before I will use a COVID-19 vaccine candidate."

I personally have children in my household who are at risk. As well as others in our family. So my husband and I feel the benefits out way the risks.

In my opinion, the dumbest way to advertise this process was to cast it as ""Warp Speed."" I would never do anything as stupid as ingesting something into my body developed at warped speed. Trump and craziness has made me completely distrust federal government. And unfortunately the people in government (politicians and civil servants) who should be standing up to Trump won't. And finally, private companies have shown themselves so greedy for money that they have engaged in supporting a President who is not fit to lead this country mostly for the sake of getting tax breaks and dangerous deregulations. I do not believe for one second that a private company will for forgo taking shortcuts for the sake of huge profits. Neither I or other members of my family and extended family members plan to take any vaccine while so much craziness is taking place. It's unfortunate, but because so many people do not trust our leaders we will not get any vaccine for COVID-19. For many black people like me, the 2020 elections is truly a life or death issue."

Just wait a month. And take your pick from other vaccines that will be on the market. As a thumb rule I'd say that if the Germans allow a vaccine (given there is no immediate chaos dooming in the country), you can be pretty sure it is well checked and effective.

Of course there is always and for every individual the chance that it won't work or have nasty side effects. But I should think that they wont be worse than a really bad case of c19.

I cannot imagine getting vaccinated without knowing the side effects. As such, if a vaccine hits the market, I am going go wait and see the population response before I take the plunge.

Additionally, as a pre-requisite to vaccination I want the US government to publish the active ingredients with their concentrations, the development and testing protocols, data gathered with its analysis and the decisions taken at each step.** As a data scientist, I know how to read and interpret data.

If you don't accept the vaccine, then you  sign a waiver that you will not use any public hospitals, medical services or clinics once you actually do get Covid 19. To be admitted to a public health facility you will need to show proof that you were vaccinated. 

Draconian? Let's see how everyone feels this fall when Covid 19 is still raging around the world and the US deaths have passed a quarter-million. Let's see how we feel when the seasonal flu arrives this winter and converges with a second wave of Covid 19. Flu hits the younger population pretty hard and in tandem with Covid 19, their sense of invulnerability is going to dissipate pretty quickly.

Right now we have an ignorant, barely literate leader who constantly disparages science (and facts). Imagine Trump trying to sell our country on the need for a strong vaccine program? The majority of Americans wouldn't even trust this serial liar to predict today's weather.

I read the scientific literature about new medicines, but history shows that only time reveals when scientific studies or decision-making have been flawed or corrupted or data have been manipulated or suppressed to bring bad drugs to market, e.g.:

	•Despite debate about its safety, the FDA approved Redux in 1996 and did not stop distribution until 2 studies published in the NEJM in 1997 and numerous patient complaints reported serious side effects.
	• Before it was withdrawn, the FDA assured consumers that Rezulin’s potential benefits outweighed its grave risks.
	• Since early 1980’s, drug companies knew the FDA might ban PPA, but it was not banned until after the NEJM published a definitive Yale epidemiologic study in 2000.
	• Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft were on the market for up to 15 years before it was acknowledged they could increase suicidal thoughts in adolescents and children. 
	• The promotion and marketing of Oxycontin has caused a public health tragedy we are still battling.

Americans know that a vaccine will protect our communities.  In a race to produce a vaccine with a market limited only by the population of the entire world, you have to convince them that the product is safe and that corporate greed, financial interests, and politics are not ignoring or downplaying the risks. In normal times, any rational person would be skeptical. In these times, we are cynical as well. In the mean time, I'll wear a mask."

Were it not so, perhaps more people of color & minorities would consider immunization for themselves & their children. It is sad & incomprehensible that the past so impinges on our present to the detriment of millions of innocents.

I volunteer my services to a medical group on behalf of the mothers & children of West Africa who have far less than we in the USA. That people of color and minority communities survive  anywhere is no tribute to science yet science did make a difference in all of our lives. They who were & are so ill-used & dismissed are resilient to a degree. The COVID virus mocks that resilience. I can only hope that ALL of us will benefit from a COVID vaccine as I have personally benefited since childhood from immunization. 

I profoundly hope that ALL of us will help all of our brethren of any color, race & predisposition everywhere to have the benefits of immunizations.

The Times is quite right to say the Trump is not very trustworthy but I would like to add to that that the New York Times itself is so political that it itself has stopped being trustworthy. 

 I wish so much that we have some neutral voices, not of trump himself, nor of people who hate Trump, but people who wished the best for the American people.

That said, when one considers the damage COVID-19 does to both individuals and to societies, on balance, like most vaccines (polio, tetanus, diptheria, smallpox and others), a vaccine candidate that passes muster should be well worth widespread dissemination at little or no cost.

If it works, then those who get it will have immunity. If less than a threshold fraction of the population get it, we will not have herd immunity, but the results will be concentrated among the population that did not get it. I think subsequent evidence of who's getting it and who isn't, combined with the fear of getting it, will convince most of them to change their minds in relatively short order.

Yes, a few will continue to refuse, worrying that the vaccine will change them into teenage mutant ninja turtles or worse. So be it."

Again effort by the Govermnent and CDC have been the leaders in vaccine develpment.  As is, the private pharma was never interested in vaccines since there is not much money and profit in that effort.  Today India is the largest supplier of vaccines to the world led by the Serum Institute of Pune in India.  Thus the responsibility for the mistrust lies squarely on this administration.  Anyway, given the nature of COVID 19 those who decline the vaccine will be the losers.  I still believe the approval process for efficacy and safety will be handeled well by FDA/CDC combined."

Now, under the Trump administration, I hesitate. I would not get a Covid-19 vaccine while Trump Is in the White House. I do not trust anything the WH, FDA, HHS, or the CDC says. 

This is the CDC who Initially told us not to wear masks, claiming it was not necessary. It turned out it was necessary, and they knew it, but they were simply telling us not to because there was a mask shortage. Luckily, i disregarded their advice on that issue, as it made no sense and have been wearing a mask since late February/early March. Moreover, they could not even be trusted to prepare a workable Covid-19 test . 

The FDA was the agency that caved on Trump’s  Hydroxychroroquine mania and actually authorized its use, only to later decide against it and pull its recommendation, when it turned out that it was dangerous and caused more harm than good.

As for HHS, where do I begin? Our  health is not their priority. HHS only exists to serve and obey Trump,  no matter how detrimental to our collective health Trump’s edicts  and directives may be. We have no national testing plan and no cohesive message.

To further reassure me, one of my coworkers actually worked with the group before her current position and she says she would test this vaccine - while there are others, like HIV vaccines (which use whole virus), that she would be concerned about, she feels this one will be safe. 

It is also important for people to know how ""adverse events"" are logged.... *ANYTHING* bad that happens and causes a hospitalization within a certain period of time after a study medication/vaccine is given gets logged no matter how far fetched it is that it is related... Motor vehicle accidents have ended up in adverse events lists. My co-worker had to file an adverse event for a toddler who tripped because he caught a toe in the crack getting on the elevator as they were leaving and broke an ankle... so yeah, broken ankle is listed somewhere as a possible 'side effect' or risk of flu vaccine..."
2020-07-18 18:43:33,If Trump tells me a vaccine is ready I'll just stay home. When Joe tells me it's safe I'll roll up my sleeve.
2020-07-18 18:28:34,"Anthropologists have discovered that the early writings of the dinosaurs discounted the possibility of comets or meteors hitting the earth.  No doubt a vaccine discovered at “warp speed” and under the the parentage of this clown administration creates much concern and skepticism;  on the plus side, perhaps when a safe, effective vaccine is available, it will be the comet which proves the anti-vaccine crowd wrong permanently."
2020-07-18 18:51:22,"One reason people are against vaccines is because the pro-vaccine side never engages with their concerns (I/my family are fully vaxed. Extended family are anti-vax so I know their position). They are maligned as ignorant, idiots, anti-science, etc. That there seems to be a correlation between vax's and whatever 'damage' anti-vaxers are claiming is dismissed. People get vax'ed, and then get very sick or die. This fear drives them. Ive never seen this studied transparently. Maybe because we dont have enough money to study it, maybe we accept possible bad outcomes as justifiable losses given the overall benefit, maybe we can't pay attention to these concerns because paying attention would give the question legitimacy that would scare others, and then we'd really have a problem getting people vaccinated. Point is, unless and until the scientific and medical community acknowledges the concerns, point by point, and provides data, anti-vaxers will feel even more that there is something being hidden and will dig in deeper to their suspicions. Personally, I believe all medical treatments are a numbers game. People get damaged by medical treatment of all kinds (childbirth, surgery, pharmaceuticals...), but the majority benefit. Medicine is imperfect, but we strive to do the best we can for the greatest good. Acknowledge the gray area, eliminate suspicion caused by conflicts of interest, and then advocate the greater good."
2020-07-18 18:31:12,Given the corruption in the Trump administration the only vaccines to be trusted are those that have been independently scientifically reviewed and tested by academic research center scientists who have absolutely no financial interest in the outcome.
2020-07-18 19:01:47,"Pharmaceutical companies didn't want to bother with developing vaccines, which must be affordable and accessible to the whole population to be truly effective. 

To ensure profitability on accessible, and therefore lower profit margin vaccines, they also must get a huge buy-in, and right now, while everyone is thinking about it is the perfect time. Oh, and some government grants, aka Corporate Welfare--is always welcome.

Regarding safety, no worries, for the pharmaceutical firms rushing vaccines to market. Vaccine makers are protected from lawsuits pertaining to vaccinations, and they certainly didn't lobby for protection because vaccines are risk-free.

Regarding approval, you can be sure that Trump's FDA stooges will go ahead and approve vaccines even if there are red flags or concerns. Former lobbyists who maintain industry ties are entrenched in our government agencies, and nowadays, evidently, you don't actually need a scientific background to run one.

So, yes, we should ALL be concerned about being guinea pigs in the Great COVID Vaccine Race, especially, right now, people who would otherwise get the vaccine just to prove that they are not an ""anti-vaxxer,"" and be just as willing to ignore the science against as an ""anti-vaxxer"" might ignore the science for.

If you want to sign up and be part of the test batch, there is nothing wrong with that, just as long as you weigh the pros and cons.

Right now, though, it seems that even the infected don't retain immunity."
2020-07-18 19:01:54,"I'll get a vaccine when my reading tells me that this particular vaccine has been tested enough for me to be confident the risks of covid-19 are higher than the risks of the vaccine.  

This article is about what other people will do.  I'm not terribly concerned about that.  Different people will make different decisions.  Initially, we will be so far from herd immunity that realistic ranges won't matter.  And, the initial supply is likely to be limited. 

If the vaccine really is effective, pretty soon 100% of the people entering hospitals with positive covid tests will be non-vaccinated.  The media will report that fact.  Rational people will decide there is enough evidence to act.  I can't do anything about irrational people."
2020-07-18 18:07:44,"Millions of Americans will get the vaccine. I am one of them. I am not afraid of it. Going without a vaccine means I am at risk for COVID, and having the vaccine means I may be at risk for something else. But, life is a crap shoot no matter how you look at it. I am a strong believer in traditional medicine. I support physicians and researchers. I do this because I have been the beneficiary of a new method to treat what could have been a brain anomaly that would have killed me. Instead, I agreed to be one of the few people who had been treated in a new way, and it changed my life. I will once again step up to be one of the first to have the vaccine, and I have every confidence that it will work."
2020-07-18 17:38:37,"Any dog owner knows what parvo is and that the vaccines are necessary.  The vaccine for it includes the canine coronavirus, too and is given annually after the first year because the antibodies fade.  Knowing this, it is highly unlikely there will be a one shot cure for humans.  I am married to a doctor (whose uncle had polio), I am a firm supporter of scientific facts as opposed to one article (debunked immediately) and I know the effort that goes into a vaccine. I will admit the speed is a little spooky.  The surrender won't happen as fast as we like.  But, as people repeatedly get injected with no adverse effects (hopefully), the trust will come. It's definitely not preferred, but it's not like preference is taken into account by our current administration. It took him almost 4 years to screw everything up so we can't expect to fix it fast."
2020-07-18 17:16:15,"How would anyone know the long-term affects of this vaccine? Sounds like a crap shoot to me, and anything that Trump and his administration touch cannot be trusted. I’m not anti-vaccine, but I would be wary of this."
2020-07-18 19:02:39,"The sheer irony of it all is unprecedented!  Trumps base have been led to mistrust or disbelieve science and the Deep State while the rest of the country has learned to distrust anything and everything from this administration.

2020-07-18 19:00:00,"In Luebeck, Germany, is one of the oldest hospitals in Europe, still standing and still in use as a medical facility, and it was a convent building. The Church repurposed it as a hospital for Black Death (bubonic plague) victims. 
In fighting this corona virus pandemic, the religious community and the medical community must again be on the same page, and the politicians all need to take a back seat and remain quiet, unless they are properly telling ""their"" constituents to mask, distance, and wash their hands, and change their shirts and blouses, and protect their families. 
The best vaccine, and there are 120 research projects going on worldwide now, will be very effective. 
It took many patient years for an effective polio vaccine to be developed. Politics needs to stay out of the way of scientific research here, No politicizing!
I was brought up in a Christian community with members of the CDC, and we had an effective parish nurse on the church staff, too. Religion and science are not enemies. 
There must be a lot of education, meetings, outreach, to get everybody on board when there is an effective Covid-19 vaccination available, and both the Democrats and the Republicans should steer clear of any involvement in the scientific development of an effective vaccine, except to support the research efforts wholeheartedly, and research results MUST be shared across global political fault lines, across political parties, and in the religious communities on this earth."
2020-07-18 19:02:21,Darwin will win out. Let those who follow science get vaccinated. Let those who don’t want a vaccination get sick and...... you can’t fix stupid.
2020-07-18 19:11:22,"This will be a totally different form of ""anti-vax"" and I can't believe I'm writing this, but I will be among them.  To an extent.
I am not distrustful of science or scientists, generally speaking. But I am distrustful of anything remotely associated with the trump administration.  He wants a vaccine to be developed at ""warp speed"" to help himself get re-elected, not to help the American people or the worldwide population resist the ravages of this horrible disease.  He could care less about that.
Sadly, there would need to be deep, independent vetting and investigation of the company producing the vaccine to rule out the expected trump grift move.  
Hopefully it won't come from an American company and that fact will shorten the time to rule out any involvement from the most least-trusted human on the planet."
2020-07-18 19:13:47,"I've never been anti-vax.  I get the flu shot yearly.  Had the pneumonia and shingles vaccines.

But I do not believe anything Trump says.  I also do not believe enough testing will be done on a large enough variety of people with a large enough variety of health issues that the vaccine will be as safe as the current vaccines are.

We still have no idea how long immunity lasts.

Therefore, I will likely be waiting for some time after a vaccine is developed before I will use it."
2020-07-18 19:14:14,"Good, those who distrust science will make the wait time for the rest of us to get the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine shorter!

However, schools should not allow anyone to attend who has not been vaccinated (teachers, students, staff). Nursing homes should not allow anyone in (patients, staff, visitors) who have not been vaccinated. Health care providers that have not been vaccinated should not be allowed to treat/handle/interact in person with patients. Those who have not been vaccinated should be required to wear masks in public until the virus hasn't been seen in the country for one year (and that probably won't happen for a very long time).

This would require government issued/controlled tracking of who is/is not vaccinated and some form of ID card or annotation on driver's licenses or similar."
2020-07-18 19:15:08,"I believe the data on coronavirus and believe we should tale precautions. 

But I am extremely hesitant on any new vaccine. I want to get pregnant and we will not know the side affects on us nor our offsprings. 

I hope it does not become a mandate for work."
2020-07-18 19:21:45,"In the additional Coronavirus articles listed at the end of this one, one of the headlines reads: ""Chief Vaccine Scientist Will Not Be Forced to Disclose Pharmaceutical Stocks."" Seriously? On top of everything else--most notably undermining the CDC and avoiding all accountability and transparency--how can we possibly be expected to trust this administration to prioritize public health and safety concerns over doing whatever it takes to elevate Trump to ""hero"" status for delivering a vaccine at ""warp speed"" before November? Under any of the previous administrations in my life (Republican and Democratic), I would have gladly take the vaccine. Not this one. I'll wait until the next administration and to hear what safety concerns, if any, were buried because Trump didn't like what they said and would have made him miss his reelection deadline. Don't patronize me with marketing and messaging (paid for by taxpayers) about the safety of vaccines. I consider them safe under any other circumstances except this one."
2020-07-18 19:27:53,"I am curious how people would feel about a coronavirus vaccine vetted by the EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, or Canada rather than the United States. Would that have any bearing on your decision to get vaccinated?

I am guessing most people would feel a whole lot more confident if the government of another first-world nation besides the U.S. was recommending a specific vaccination. 

What a horrible commentary on the state of our country."
2020-07-18 19:29:31,If we can't trust our medical professionals who can we trust?  Certainly not our politicians.
2020-07-18 19:49:50,"I think an issue here is balancing long term risk. Every vaccination comes with risk, and the side effects can be anything from paralysis to death. They are very rare, but no one steps up, as far as I know, to pay all the expenses for your now paralyzed kid. 
Another issue is trusting in for profit medicines. I don't trust them. It's over-diagnose, over-treat, and sell, sell, sell! On the backs and bodies of human beings. We adopted our children from another country, and they were given something like 27 vaccinations. Jeez. I can totally get behind MMR, polio, Dip/tet, but that felt excessive. Especially when you are talking about substances that are preserved with mercury.
I think there are a lot of reasons to be wary of excessive vaccinations, especially when the scientific response is ""just do it and don't ask questions""!"
2020-07-18 19:51:06,"The Covid vaccination landscape will play out like so many other social dynamics in recent American history. We will be all too quick to assert our rights but disavow any obligation for the consequences. In this case, we can refuse the vaccination but if we get sick and don't have insurance, someone else is obligated to pay for our care."
2020-07-18 19:54:55,"I'm the furthest thing from an anti-vac person, but I wouldn't take a vaccine based on Trump's word that it's safe.  Or, the word of anybody he appointed or controls. 

Nor would I trust data that goes to the White House instead of the CDC. 

Trump has already come out in favor of anti-malarial drugs that are potentially harmful (continuing to ignore that evidence) and suggested drinking disinfectant.  

Hopefully, we'll get trustworthy information from overseas and from our Universities."
2020-07-18 20:02:06,"It’s really quite remarkable that as a country and a culture we've done such a horrible job at educating each other. The number of people that are apparently unwilling or incapable of understanding basic science, statistics and reasoning is a national tragedy and cause for a lot of reflection, soul searching and dialog. Here's the deal with vaccines- are they perfect? No. Nothing is perfect. Is there a global conspiracy to make children sick by giving them vaccines? No. Drs and scientists are really trying to help and are really not evil people. Is there a possibility that a tiny percentage of people getting a vaccination do get sick or have an adverse reaction? Almost definitely. Some people are allergic to water or peanuts or chocolate. With more research, maybe we'll be able to customize vaccines for each individual and perhaps eliminate the unfortunate side effects the tiny percentage of folks might be dealing with. Do far more children and adults benefit from vaccines, die less often, live longer, healthier lives and basically thrive instead of perish than they would without them? Yes. The numbers are clear, the facts are real. As an American living abroad that has traveled quite extensively, I can say that most of the world finds America to be a disturbing paradox: we are home to some of the best and the some of the worst. I hope that there's a way forward that enables not just America, but all people to thrive in a healthy, peaceful and caring world."
2020-07-18 20:04:49,"The money spent by the US on several companies allows these companies to manufacture significant quantities without taking the financial risk, themselves: that the vaccines won’t be safe enough or effective enough and the investment in the premanufactured goods will have to be destroyed. This cuts years off the process because the manufacturing usually only occurs after approval and in this case billions of doses need to be made. The activities of development and manufacturing run in parallel with the US Gvt losing the investment of the vaccines are failures.   The risk to a safe vaccine is not jeaordized"
2020-07-18 20:06:38,"If Americans are to derive any comfort from this,  there are many institutions in several countries(mostly publicly funded) around the planet that are heavily involved in research to find a vaccine for Covid 19(several in Canada alone).  Outside of the Oxford/UK research and maybe China, little has been mentioned in the U. S.  MSM about others around the world.

I would tend to agree that the American model which looks for the ""quick fix"" and desire to raise investor value, one could look upon any company, especially, Moderna that during its entire existence has never brought an effective vaccine of any kind to market, all of a sudden,  they just might have something.

In any case, Covid-19 is part of the SARS family of viruses that were involved in an outbreak in 2003 with a vaccine yet to be developed.  President Trump and those that wish to stroke his massive ago are just not being realistic as to how long all of this might take."
2020-07-18 20:21:14,"This article captures my own thoughts and fears accurately.  I believe in vaccines and am up-to-date. I will get the seasonal flu vaccine as soon as it is available.  But I worry about the ""warp speed"" testing of a new vaccine, if bad side effects  take time to manifest across broad test groups. I worry a lot about the political hacks that now infest the FDA and HHS and that corrupt the CDC making decisions about safety.  If Trump and Navarro succeed in getting the FDA to bow to their latest pressure on hydroxychloroquine, even the FDA career scientists will have zero credibility approving a vaccine. 

We need to start an public service campaign now to educate the population about what vaccines are, how they work, how they are developed and tested, why there might be multiple COVID-19 vaccines (how would they differ, and why), and why we could legitimately expedite the development and testing of this one.  And we will need brave political and cultural leaders to be among the first to publicly take the shot.  Somehow I doubt that would include Trump! But perhaps others will step up."
2020-07-18 20:22:43,"I would be very careful, and very hesitant, to allow myself to be injected with a vaccine that is approved at record speed without adequate and traditional testing. And this is especially true if the vaccine is developed by a pharmaceutical that has been invested in heavily by trump and his friends!! 

As we have frequently seen, trump’s motivation in backing ANYTHING is most likely due to the personal profit he and his family and friends are likely to garner by its sales - and not much beyond that. It will be secondary to trump and his ilk if the vaccine actually works. As long as the profit is swift and great, why would they care about its efficacy?"
2020-07-18 20:22:50,"I'll get the vaccine as soon as it's available. No, I don't trust the Trump administration, but the least I can do to help our doctors treat this thing is make sure it works."
2020-07-18 20:30:28,"""Conscientious objectors"" seems like an oxymoron in this context.    Conscientiousness  requires that we rely on the advice of medical experts. It's our responsibility to find doctors we trust and follow through with advice they give us including immunizations."
2020-07-18 20:32:13,"I expect it won't be long after the vaccine is released that we will know of any adverse effects.  The media and many others of skeptical of the administration and I expect anyone who has an adverse that could have been from a vaccine will be put in the spotlight.

One thing that disturbs me beyond the immediate danger is my concern that many of the conditions that facilitated this virulent pandemic.  My personal belief is the virus jumped to people due to either unsafe virology or unsafe wet markets.  It then apprently spread rapidly spread across the globe in part because of a deliberate lack of transparency during which domestic travel was apparently suppressed as internation travel from Wuhan continued.  When the Virus reached us we had a clear lack of PPE and in my view no solid plan to deal with it.  We initially had a shortage of tests that ideally would have helped contain the spread.  My daughter got sick with something early on and could not get a test.

Anyway, why won't this same scenario happen again in five years?"
2020-07-18 20:34:20,"Like many here, I was skeptical and concerned ...but am MORE CONFIDENT now that the vaccines in the pipeline will be safe. For the first time ever, I have been wary and distrustful of the CDC and FDA and HHS, not because of the hundreds of brilliant people who work at those entities, but because of  interference and obfuscation from the anti-science Trump administration. I was worried that maybe I couldn't fully trust the safety of any vaccines and treatments heralded by Trump. Was the manufacturer a buddy of Trump's? Were trials being dangerously expedited in order to serve his re-election deadlines?   Would drugs ever be fairly and efficiently distributed to those at highest risk (frontline workers, health care workers, teachers, elderly and urban poor living in cramped quarters)?

Then I heard Andy Slavitt's podcast ""In the Bubble"" on Monday and felt very reassured. Andy talks to Drs Mark McClellan and David Agus about where we are on treatments and vaccines. Not only is the progress and pace of innovation mind-boggling, but these trusted experts were confident that the meds would be sufficiently tested and vetted in part because the US does NOT control a lot of these studies. Much of the progress is being made elsewhere, where science is less politicized and where GLOBAL health  collaboration is something that matters. They also felt the FDA rules for approving the vaccines are clear and trustworthy.  Neither of these guys is a Trump employee, buddy or supporter, either."
2020-07-18 20:41:57,"I am not being pessimistic, but realistic here to point out that there is no vaccine for HIV, which is a virus. HIV has been around since the 80s. Scientists are still working on it. 

There is so much that scientist are finding out about COVID-19 still. 

I want a vaccine, but want one that has been thoroughly tested and one created by a person who could be like a new Jonas Salk. Someone driven to help humanity and not driven by the large financial windfall that this vaccine will cost each person.  Call me hopeful in this regard."
2020-07-18 20:43:12,"I believe doubting the vaccine has some validity. I'm old enough to remember the swine flu vaccine under the Ford administration that was also rushed into production for political reasons. More people came down with the swine flu due to the vaccine than from the virus itself. I am in my late 60's and I get the flu shot every year, but I'm very leary about taking the Covid-19 vaccine if it comes out by the end of this year unless there is some irrefutable proof that it works."
2020-07-18 20:47:53,"The facts are that we don't know enough yet to have confidence in the development of a safe and effective vaccine in a timely manner. The timeline being pushed seems divorced from scientific reality and is highly political--partly to serve the Trump administration's desire to be seen has having things under control and partly because I believe some health officials believe that it will be easier for the public to follow social distancing guidelines if they believe it will be very limited in duration. Being pro-vax and pro-science does not mean believing either is magic. Effective solutions and scientific understanding take time. Rushing this has the potential to destroy public confidence in vaccines that have been proven to be effective and will further compromise public health. Instead, we should hedge our investments with continued development and improvement in rapid testing, other treatments and overall healthcare infrastructure to mitigate the impact in case vaccine development takes a reasonable amount of time (""long"") or fail altogether. We should not put all of our eggs in the vaccine basket."
2020-07-18 20:50:23,"Two viral diseases so far are considered eradicated because of vaccines. Smallpox and Rinderpest. Smallpox vaccine was largely safe but there were complications of 1 in 100,000. When HIV came along an army recruit died because of acquired immunodeficiency. So there are always genuine medical concerns that should exclude immunization. But the only way humanity will acquire herd immunity is if most of the population is immunized safely and effectively. If there are people who are vaccine-hesitant because of politics or a belief that vaccines are harmful to all and sundry can be spared of vaccination but not be allowed near a patient or a child. Everyone should have a right to not be near a person who refuses a generally considered safe vaccine or not wearing a proper mask properly and everyone should be immune to prosecution for not accepting medical service or classroom education from a vaccine-hesitant person. 

I once refused to let a technician draw my blood because she was butchering my vein and she called another lady who seemed to know what she was doing. I will have no hesitation in refusing vaccine-hesitant person from coming close to me for any procedure. I also refuse any person who does not wear a proper mask properly from coming close to me."
2020-07-18 20:57:11,"This article mentions in passing that the underlying  concern for a lot of folks isn’t general resistance to vaccines, but “haste.” However, none of the experts offered any assurances to resolve that concern. I don’t see anyway to get ahead of this legitimate worry without making claims fo a vaccine that doesn’t exist - which to my ears would sound like disingenuous marketing. We can collectively wring our hands now, but I don’t think informed patients can make a decision until we know which vaccines make it to the dr’s office. (For the record, I’m fully vaccinated, as are my kids!)"
2020-07-18 20:57:29,"I'm not an anti-vaxxer or other kind of nutjob.  But despite the world's desire to have an effective vaccine, we still have to vet any vaccines.  A scientist can't say ""this one works,"" wait a week to see if test patients drop dead, and then start jabbing needles into millions.  We have to be sure that a vaccine is effective AND safe.  I've already decided that I'll wait a few months after a vaccine is released, just to be sure others aren't experiencing unforeseen complications.  I absolutely appreciate that so many scientists are working hard on developing vaccines and/or treatments, but they should not be so rushed that safety is possibly compromised."
2020-07-18 21:02:07,And if you had to convince everyone to take one every three months? What if that's how long immunity lasts?
2020-07-18 21:02:38,"In the US, we traditionally do require vaccines for children; we of course allow medical exemptions; religious and philosophical exemptions are also allowed in some states, but are being phased out, and appropriately so.

Adults are not required to have vaccinations they don't want.  For example, half the population declines to have annual flu shots.  There are about 50,000 deaths from flu each year, and probably half or more would be prevented if vaccination became universal, either through a legal requirement, or more widespread common sense.  But requiring vaccinations for adults goes against the grain in this country.

Perhaps this is how it should be for a corona vaccine.  We can hope an effective one will become available, but it should probably be left up to the individual when and if to get it.  Some may opt in early, others may wait a few months or longer.

Those who choose to delay for a longer period or to avoid vaccination should probably be free to do so; they are only putting themselves at risk.  (the risk of covid in children is pretty low, so it's not clear if we should mandate vaccination in the young).

We allow smoking in private homes and in many states riding a motorcycle without a helmet.  Many don't wear seatbelts, even though they are legally required. 

And then there's skiing. You can get hurt skiing.

The important thing is that we do everything we can to make a vaccine available to those who choose to get it, as soon as medically possible."
2020-07-18 21:05:33,"First of all, it's unlikely that any vaccine would be ready and available for public use until early 2021 at the soonest, which means that we are not necessarily going to be required to ""trust the Trump administration"" about its safety. 

Trump could, of course, be reelected, but at this point it seems more likely Biden will be president, and hopefully his administration would win back a certain amount of public trust. Trump had lied shamelessly and often, about the pandemic and much else. If Biden comes in, tells the truth, makes policy decisions based on science and genuine compassion, and talks to us as if we were grown-ups, he can win back trust.

I sometimes wonder what the situation might be like today if, from the beginning, Trump had emphasized the seriousness of the crisis, talked honestly about it, supported social distancing measures, and appeared in public wearing a mask.

If a vaccine is ready, Biden could call a press conference, talk about the need for mass vaccinations, talk candidly about the potential risks and rewards, and receive his shot right on camera. In the world we live in now, there would still be plenty of conspiracy theorists who say Biden's show wasn't real, it's all a plot by Soros or Gates or the Illuminatti or whoever. But I think most people are capable of making the right decision when presented with a clear set of facts."
2020-07-18 19:13:32,"I will get the vaccine after I see Trump, Pence, Pompeo, DeVos, the rest of the Cabinet, McConnel, and Paul get the shot in front of TV cameras."

BTW - this isn’t my plan, it’s Mother Nature’s plan. She doesn’t suffer fools."
2020-07-18 20:58:13,"Of course, Trump's kids and grandkids all get vaccinated.   I knew their pediatrician in New York.    He is evil."
2020-07-18 19:25:10,"Many of the posters here are missing the salient issue because of their desire to stunt on anti-vaxxers and prove how smugly rational they are. This vaccine will have been the fastest ever developed, by far, under enormous political pressure, with massive economic incentive to bring something to market, by pharmaceutical companies that have proven over and over how little they care about anything but profit. I’ve taken every vaccine, but I will be waiting on this one, and the people here labeling anyone who raises any objections as “idiots” can volunteer to be guinea pigs for this experiment."

   At the same time, I have zero trust in ethics of the pharmaceutical industry. Overprescription abounds. I myself am victim of a statin drug that had no proven benefit for my demographic, yet left me within 6 months unable to walk again. (StatinStories.com)

We have no compulsory system for reporting the adverse effects of medications, so we don't even know the downsides.

Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies are allowed to get away with crazy stuff. The newish vaccine vs shingles, Shingrix, is a case in point. Though it's touted as safe because it's a dead virus, the vaccine uses an extremely powerful new adjuvant.

In fact, patients with autoimmune etiologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and lupus were excluded in the clinical trials--one assumes because of the adjuvant. BUT not one of my doctors knew this. Is it on the warning label? I can't find anything.

So you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor says to take this safe, dead virus, but the manufacture purposely took you out of the trial--so no one knows what will happen to you.

On top of this, whatever happens, you doctor is not required to report it, so no one is likely to ever know.

It's madness. The pharma company does their trials, then pays the FDA $2.5 million in what's called a Prescription Drug User Fee, to submit it for approval. These ""fees"" pay 68% of the review budget for prescription drugs. $ not scien"

Take for example the world ""cases per capita"" map they 
show. Its red for the whole USA and a very pale yellow for
all east Asia and most of Africa. Only in Europe is it spotty. 
The USA only version of this is even spottier. 

But in fact the world map is a ""reality"" lie. Its not a political
lie, it represents what it says it is: ""CONFIRMED""
 cases. But in most place around the world that's a meaningless number, because either the count itself is a huge undercount, or the official number is an outlight lie. 

It would be easier to trust those who attempt to make points (i.e. the NYTimes) if they would give up on politics and 
tell the truth, the real truth. Note that nothing awful happened in Sweden. Screaming won't make what happened there actually be awful. Awful is Cuomo forcing sick people into
nursing homes.  

Vaccination rates will depend a lot on what type of vaccine it is, and the track record of similar ones. It will depend on the truthfulness record of the source. One notes that on a scale of -5 to +5, the NYTimes on the Coronavirus politics is -4.  You do have SOME graphs that look like they are both correct and tell the important story ... but you seem to scream about ones that tell misleading stories. 

Our local newspaper, the New-Gazette, seems to be a +4. I don't seem to remember a single political article on the coronavirus! And they explain very well."

Unfortunately, the NYT itself has frequently made this problem worse by casually using that term to refer to a wide variety of people with different concerns.

To convince people who are hesitant about vaccines, you have to actually listen to what they are saying and you have to admit all relevant truths. All medical treatments have risks, including vaccines. Denying that only fuels skepticism.

You may find that many skeptics believe they have been lied to. For them, repeating the same message and denying any significant risks only reinforces their beliefs.

2020-07-18 19:20:12,"I am a professor in a microbiology department, and although I am not an immunologist, I can say that the safety of any Covid-19 vaccine is a very real issue.  Some coronaviruses, including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19), are subject to something called ""Antibody Dependent Enhancement"", or ""ADE"".  This is when antibodies against the virus help the virus infect a subset of immune cells.  When there is ADE, low levels of antibodies can make the disease more severe than if there were no antibodies at all.  A recent paper about this is ""Implications of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection for SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures"" by Eroshenko, Gill, Keaveney, Church, Trevejo & Rajaniemi, Nature Biotechnology vol. 38, pg 789–791(2020).  (There are many other published papers on the subject.)  The fear is that with some vaccines, antibody levels will drop with time, and at some point (6 months, a year) will allow infection with SARS-CoV-2 and ADE, and the disease will be worse than with no vaccine.  Although this scenario is probably unlikely, it could be very, very bad if it does come to pass.  It is hard to be sure that a vaccine will not lead to antibody-dependent enhancement without lengthy testing."
2020-07-18 21:10:36,"There are many of us who have health conditions that have required us to stay at home since March. The people refusing to wear masks and take other precautions have taken my freedom away due to their thoughtlessness for others. I’m very concerned that not enough people will be vaccinated to create true herd immunity—you know, that state of community protection that people not taking the virus seriously enough keep throwing out as the answer, except that they were hoping to achieve herd immunity by forcing everyone to actually be infected with Covid, even if some of us would get very sick, possibly with lifelong health consequences, and even death. Sweden has shown that that strategy of allowing infections to run amok does not achieve herd immunity, it just harms and kills more people. Please consider the health needs of everyone in your community when thinking about getting vaccinated. Please consider the golden rule and how that applies to vaccines. FYI: modern vaccines do NOT contain live virus pieces as in the past; getting vaccinated will not cause infection."
2020-07-18 21:18:24,"Only a vaccine will allow this nightmare pandemic to end.

Some folks will likely make a personal choice and get vaccinated early, others may decide to delay a few weeks or months. Most adults will choose to be vaccinated. Those who choose not to are, for the most part, only putting themselves at risk.

The major concern is not people who choose not to be vaccinated, it's whether a vaccine can be developed and how long it will take. We absolutely need to do everything we can to make a vaccine available.

We must  recognize that developing, testing, and mass producing an effective vaccine will take all hands on deck, including the government, academia, and, importantly, major pharmaceutical companies. 

Today, pharmaceutical companies face an existential threat to their existence and ability to develop a vaccine: US trial lawyers.

Lawsuits are now threatening several major firms with bankruptcy, including Johnson  and Johnson, and Bayer. We need companies like these to remain financially solvent.  

There have been multiple recent multibillion dollar judgments against drug firms, and literally tens of thousands more suits are pending.  During the 1970's and 80's lawsuits nearly shut down vaccine production in the US; only an 11th hour no-fault liability law passed by Congress in 1986 allowed vaccines to remain available in the US.

We need tort reform, or this issue may be moot, because there will be no vaccine available."
2020-07-18 21:19:22,"I agree with the people who say that they won't take a vaccine just because Donald Trump says it's safe.  Donald Trump told people to inject bleach.

But if things continue as they are, the Trump Regime will be long gone by the time a vaccine is ready, and public health authorities will again be in charge of vaccine development and testing without tinkering by politicians.  By then, I won't hesitate to get vaccinated.

And if a core of anti-vaxxers remains who refuse to take the vaccine, who cares?  They'll be Republicans and we need fewer Republicans anyway."
2020-07-18 21:21:30,"The approval of COVID19 tests coming into this country without making sure they worked has made the FDA an organization that cannot be trusted.

Instead,  I would trust a vaccine coming out of, and approved by Oxford or Stanford to be tested by intelligent people who are not simply in it for the money.  When institutions like those say go ahead and get the shot, I will."
2020-07-18 21:27:50,"Once there is an effective vaccine for Covid-19, vaccination should be a requirement for entering schools, hospitals, doctor’s offices, dentists, community rec centers, government buildings and offices, and more.

2020-07-18 21:33:32,"I'm 72 and at high risk from Covid-19.  From childhood I've had all my vaccinations. It would be foolish to simply accept the word of a  President who so badly wants to open up America, that he's put our money on a warp speed solution.  I'll wait on the vaccine, if it comes, until there is 1. Full Disclosure about the trials and who has been included or excluded.  Many drug trials exclude people my age or with pre-existing conditions even though we are among the most in need of a good vaccine. 2. Reliable information from accountable scientists on the workings and effectiveness of a vaccine.  President Trump makes both of those essentials highly unlikely to occur. He has no interest in the truth or in the health of the American people.  He wants us open for business, period.  This problem outlined in the Op Ed is more than enough to have to address without the political overlay from our President."
2020-07-18 21:34:07,"I think that it's sensible to be concerned about whether a vaccine, if and when it appears, has been through the proper procedure, but I will ask someone I know who is a public health expert what they think about it.  I know that not everyone is in that position, but what do they say about six degrees of separation?  I will look at the newspaper and see what Dr. Fauci or other experts are saying.  If I read contrary statements, I will ask what the credentials or qualifications are of the person who is writing, and what their arguments are.  

Beyond this, what is one to do?  I think concern is in order, but I am reasonably confident that an educated person will be able to reach an informed opinion about what they ought to do.  I do think that it is a public health worry that people who don't know how to analyze information might mistakenly avoid (or receive) the vaccine, and it is distressing that people could be harmed, one way or another, but I very much hope that the good information gets out and the misinformation doesn't."
2020-07-18 21:38:23,"It is relatively easy for vaccine skeptics to undermine a program to vaccinate a population against measles, because to achieve herd immunity, 90-95% of the population must be made resistant. to the virus.  However, because of its lower reproductive number, it is estimated that to achieve herd immunity to COVID-19, it is only necessary to achieve about 70% coverage.  Still, there may be enough resistance to undermine the vaccine's ability to protect the population.  In order to overcome worries about the vaccine, it will be necessary for the vaccine manufacturers and the Food and Drug Administration to be very open about how the vaccine was tested, what adverse events were found, and exactly how the development and testing of the COVID-19 vaccine differed from that of previous vaccines.  That should reassure people that it is possible to move quickly without compromising safety."
2020-07-18 21:42:56,"Like many, I have always believed in vaccination and kept our shots up to date.  I am older, at risk of complications if I get Covid. But still, I will be wary of any new vaccine and will not rush out to get a shot as soon as it is released. I will be waiting and watching to see how the first rounds go. I do not trust this administration to let trusted scientists speak their mind (Where is Dr. Fauci?), nor do I trust any company not to put profit first in the rush to market.  Just like with software, never install version 1.0."

But I will not be rushing out to get the coronavirus vaccine, even though I’ll be 68 by the end of the year and fall into the vulnerable category.  This whole, stupidly named effort seems like a rush job, impelled by politics and short-circuiting established medical procedures meant to determine safety and efficacy.  My plan is to allow the first wave essentially to be the guinea pigs and see if it works without unanticipated side effects.  Then, if all is OK after a few months, then I’ll get mine.  Fortunately, I live on an island where there have been only 109 infections, no deaths, and everyone wears masks."

The NYTimes states they are recommending the reopening of brick and mortar elementary schools.  They give as a reason for this recommendation, ‘...for those in elementary schools, because those groups have the most trouble learning online.’  This is not a science based reason for reopening elementary schools. It is a subjective reason for reopening elementary schools, and the truth of such a reason is far from fact.  The subliminal message here is science, engineering, and medicine are the subject matters children have the most trouble learning online, but this does not logically or factually support reopening in-person elementary schools."

I hope that’s in the next year or so and that we are all getting better and that our country is recovering."
2020-07-18 21:38:43,"I thought we had enough to deal with when I read about the stupidity of the Trump regime, which was largely responsible for getting us into this mess. Now I see that we have to deal with the stupidity of so many responders here who have not taken the trouble to read about vaccine plans. Some claim the vaccines will be tested only on young healthy adults; but all plans call for vaccines to be tested on those who were mostly impacted by Covid-19, including older people and people of color from communities heavily been hit by the virus.  Some say that they will not trust a vaccine approved by Trump; but Trump will neither approve nor disapprove a vaccine (indeed, whatever he says, you should believe the opposite). They will be approved by trusted health experts such as Dr. Fauci. Others claim that vaccines are not to be trusted because their development is being rushed.  But protocols I have seen require strict plans for analysis of safety and efficacy in all 3 standard phases of vaccine development. Results will be published and accessible in peer-reviewed scientific Journals. It would be stupid and self-destructive for a vaccine developer to lie about results for the financial and prestige sake of being first in the market. 

I thought that all we had to worry about were Trump people and the professional ""anti-vaccers"". But we now have so many people here who claim to be in favor of vaccines but just not these  anti-Covid ones currently under development and testing."

I'm not involved in any of the COVID vaccines, but based on what I'm seeing and hearing, I'll be holding out as long as possible. It's impressive that there's a batch of working compounds so quickly, but not surprising as we're always learning new things and getting better and faster at what we do. The main issue is allowing enough time to see if people get sick from it. That can happen right away or months/years down the road, and there's nothing anyone can do to speed that part up. The Moderna phase 3 trial everyone is talking about doesn't end until over 2 years from now (Oct 2022). We'll know if it works well before that, we need that time to merely begin to see any kind of long-term health effects from it. Think about that against the insane projections of having a vaccine ready by the end of the year/next spring. I'll be holding out as long as possible--at least a year."

2020-07-18 22:51:38,"At age 71, getting infected will be like playing russian roulette. Vaccines get lots of testing before approval, so even if there is some risk, it is a lot less than the risk in not getting the vaccine."
2020-07-18 22:58:04,"With millions of lives at stake, maybe its time to rebalance the right of free speech against the right to life. The oft-quoted sanction against shouting 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre is a case in point.  Social media is the enabler of the anti-vax movement.  Social media companies have managed to avoid responsibility for this anti-social role. Maybe the time has come for legislation to fine them for every anti-vax post they publish; money is the only conscience they have. Too much time has been wasted trying to negotiate with them. The 'enormous technical difficulties' will disappear if the fines are big enough and the fines are non-negotiable. No doubt, any attempt like this would be bogged down for years in the courts. In this pandemic is there a role for emergency legislation that can be implemented urgently?"
2020-07-18 23:17:56,"As you all know, most vaccines are parts of a virus put onto the body to train the immune system to clean the actual virus from the body.  It will not be worse than getting live Covid 19. If our society keeps going with the pandemic as usual I suspect things will fall apart... everyone is suffering from it in multiple ways.  If  you are afraid of the eventual vaccine, just wait a bit to see if others die or whatnot.  The issue here is that antibodies seem to dissipate after a few months. Herd immunity is not going to happen.  Some Covid 19 patients never get health back. Our choice is: Permanent suffering under a pandemic or everyone taking vaccines every few months."
2020-07-18 23:20:15,"I'm a physician - I deal with this problem every winter, year after year.  Of course, many people won't want the covid vaccine (how many of these readers make the same excuses every year for the flu shot?). Does it really matter? They will get the corona virus infection, and play the odds like everyone else every winter. In my experience, there are enough people who do elect to get the vaccine that some degree of herd immunity is achieved. Don't be shocked, folks - it will be very unpopular. However, those who do get it will be receiving a proven measure of protection. If someone is foolish enough to turn it down, it is only they who will suffer. Anyone who truly cares about (or understands) these things will choose to protect themselves."
2020-07-18 23:24:26,"The recent article on the hesitancy of Americans to get quickly vaccinated for COVID-19 fails to acknowledge the very real possibility that a new vaccine rushed to market by an Administration which has a lofty contempt for science might, indeed, be deeply flawed.  We all saw the failed rollout of the initial CDC COVID-19 tests, with tragic results for an early containment of the spread.  We all witnessed how the recommendations of health professionals were ignored in a rush to reopen the economy.  Even when developed under far more favorable conditions, vaccines have caused damage in the past (e.g., the live cell polio vaccine, which in some cases transmitted polio.)

Simply stated, there is no way I would trust a vaccine developed under the aegis of this corrupt and self-interested president. If rushing a vaccine to market might improve his poll numbers, then I do not believe that Trump would hesitate for a moment, even if warned that the vaccine has serious side effects.  How can a weary and disillusioned nation trust a man who suggests injecting bleach and hawks dangerous and ineffective drugs to oversee a safe vaccine rollout? Doctors are still discovering dire ways that this novel coronavirus affects the human body.  I have read that radical new techniques are being explored by those trying to quickly solve this viral puzzle.  I applaud their efforts, but for my family, isolation is far preferable to offering our bodies up on the altar of political calculation."
2020-07-19 00:00:05,"I probably won't be the first to get the vaccine.  I will wait a month to see how it is impacting people.  If it seems the vaccine has had careful and tested development, I most definitely will get the vaccine, so I again can participate in more of life.  I am sure there will be some who don't get the vaccine, who are suspicious of everything except that which they themselves think of.
Most people in cities do not behave that way, fortunately."
2020-07-19 00:02:32,"My concern is that COVID vaccine safety testing will be short-circuited by the Trump's political goal of being able to deliver on his wildly optimistic claim that ""a vaccine is available by the end of the year."""
2020-07-19 00:15:45,"On April 30th, the NY Times published an article entitled, ""How Long Will a Vaccine Really Take?"" Under the typical process - that would not guarantee an effective vaccine, mind you - a vaccine would be through the trials and approval in 2036. The first case of HIV was reported in the United States in 1981; yet we don't have a vaccine. We don't have a vaccine for herpes, influenza, or even the common cold, and those viruses have been around since time immemorial. Why, pray tell, does anyone think that an efficacious vaccine will be so easy to conquer in 12-18 months? While I have traditionally valued Dr. Fauci's stewardship and guidance, I am mistrustful of even his ""optimistic"" views that a vaccine will reach market within the year. On what basis can he offer this optimism? What precedent do we have in the history of humanity that suggests we will have a triumphant vaccine with such breakneck speed? And if we do, then why haven't we developed a vaccine for other deadly killers, such as malaria or Dengue? If it were merely a matter of money, why haven't all deadly diseases been eradicated? The force with which the powers that be demand everyone get vaccinated is unsettling. If the vaccine were properly tested and effective, then everyone would scurry to get inoculated. The hesitation, in this case, is well-founded. I, too, am reluctant to become the Trump Administration's guinea pig when common sense indicates that this souffle isn't half-baked."
2020-07-19 00:16:10,I wouldn't be suspicious of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine just because it's developed rapidly. I'd be suspicious of one FDA-approved before Trump leaves office because I wouldn't trust his administration's claim of safety.
2020-07-19 00:16:37,"All vaccines work by giving a person a ""mild"" case of a disease so the body will develop its own antibodies. I don't even want a mild case of this beast. Can I just hide until it goes away? Maybe a century or so?"

Any vaccine that is associated with trump, no matter how remotely, cannot be trusted. Not by me, anyway. I’d feel safer waitIng until trump is stripped of all power and influence. 

Trump just can’t be trusted with American lives."
2020-07-19 00:22:48,"1) If standard safety testing isn't required then will the ""new"" standard become the norm?  My impression of the multiple test strategies was not just to waste time but to protect the end-user from potentially harmful drugs.
2) If ""grandmother"" or another family member needs to be protected by my getting a shot - why not just give them the shot?
3) One of the purposes of more careful testing is to handle the cases that have not been considered.  Does this vaccine cause birth defects?  Does it cause any other health issues?

But the CDC, and various prominent physician/scientists are closely following the development and trials of vaccines, and when they confirm that a vaccine is safe and protective of Covid-19, you owe it to yourself and others to get immunized."

If we let history throttle our progress we might as well give up.  We will be vaccinated as soon as our HMO makes it available.

That said, I can understand why so many people are set to refuse a vaccine.  The for-profit media has spent an almost infinite amount of resources convincing the public that because Trump is president, it is imperative to refuse and reject anything coming from his administration.  The for-profit press has left nothing whatsoever about the government as acceptable to 'both sides'.  What/whoever CNN/MSNBC/NYT praise is attacked by Fox, and vice versa.  I can't think of a single issue of substance that isn't viciously attacked by one side or the other.

We had our first manned space launch, a spectacular success that should have brought national joy and harmony to us for a moment.  But the for-profit press couldn't stand to let that story breathe.  Who even remembers it now? And neither side can stand even a solitary dissenting voice.

Would Trump shill for a faux vaccine of saline water if he could get it out prior to the election? Do any of us doubt that he would in a heartbeat?

Worst case: the vaccine has frequent and serious side effects. Next worse case:  the virus is neutral, just like a false negative test, leading many of us to expose ourselves without immunity.
Best case:  the vaccine works and has few side effects ...... but, how many of us want to bet our health on Trump’s 20,000 lies?

2020-07-18 23:03:17,"Skepticism about a CV vaccine parallels an overall skepticism about whether or not this administration is capable of supervising and implementing an effective vaccine program, or any other program.  The wheels are off and this car is going nowhere.  Favoritisms in awarding no-bid contracts (one for several millions to a company that has never developed a vaccine of any kind); dishonesty in reporting test results for the CV generally and effectiveness of certain medical interventions favored by Trump though rejected by science; the religious smoke screen spread by Pence and others (many of his ilk oppose all vaccinations on religious grounds); mismanagement and outright fraud of this administration in providing PPE; deferral to the states, etc.  All of these lead to a level of mistrust that will infect any effort by this administration to promote any vaccine.  Who can one trust?  According to Trump, not even Dr. Fauci.  Certainly no one who speaks on behalf of this group of thieves."
2020-07-18 23:31:33,"How can we trust a vaccine promoted by an administration that wants to defund testing and contact tracing, with a president who has denounced testing for resulting in more cases of Covid reported, and with him falling behind in the polls and desperate for reelection? The man lies as he’s breathes, fired anyone who disagrees with him, and has neither conscience ￼nor empathy. Of course people are wary!

If Trump were to resign many more people would believe that the vaccine was being promoted safely.￼"
2020-07-19 00:01:07,"Sad to say, anything that comes from this administration is suspect to my family, trump will use anything to advantage him in the coming election.

2020-07-19 00:09:27,"We're pro vaccines and regularly get flu and other shots. However, the behavior of the Trump administration convinces us that any vaccine they approve is likely to be done for political, not efficacy reasons.

Till now, I was a wholehearted believer in vaccine technology. I still am. I have every vaccine I am suppose to have and then some, like rabies and tetanus and pneumonia because I exercise outdoors and have chronic conditions that could get bad quickly if I I get ill. That being said, I cannot trust a vaccine for COVID-19 rushed to market and put together under the supervision of people who are suppose to protect us who say nothing while standing next to the idiot -in-chief while he tells us to drink bleach, not worry about masks, and send our children to school so the stock market doesn’t tank in October. What is the good of a fire department that doesn’t speak out against arsonists?

I just can’t trust any vaccine rushed out by THIS government.   I agree with another commenter— give me what Angela Merkle orders. Until then I will wear masks, avoid those who don’t, and stay distant. 

When those who are suppose to protect us do not immediately speak up and counter the source widely disseminated and accepted misinformation, I cannot place my wholehearted trust in them."

Conspiracy-theories, partisanship and lack of critical thinking have turned the US into the laughing-stock of the world. Any vaccine approved by the administration will have been tested and verified by numerous international bodies, so even if you distrust the FDA, do you think Trump’s tentacles extend into the public health authorities in other countries? That was a rhetorical question: of course you do. Which is why you are not going to get vaccinated, and then you are going to get sick and possibly die. As for me, if the US goes down this path to idiocracy any further, I am going back to Europe and will happily get vaccinated there."

Unless you are in a situation of high risk, DO NOT be the first one out of the gate on this.  Be cautious.  Let those of unavoidably high risk be the first to experiment.  Wait something like 6 months to see how their experience plays out.  In the meantime, stay in your bubble and watch.

With AIDS, I was able to put off the drugs with a strategy called watchful waiting.  (With Covid-19, watchful waiting is replaced by stay in your bubble.)  Eventually I couldn't wait any more and had to start with what was available.  At the time, the drug Sustiva was being pushed on everyone.  It caused shockingly violent dreams and permanent inability to fall asleep.  They don't use it any more.

It has been 40 years and there is still no vaccine for HIV.  Covid-19 has created a desperate situation where a 50-year process is being circumvented by a hail-Mary gamble to compress the process down to 6 or 9 months.

Be careful out there."
2020-07-19 00:40:54,"Unbelievable.  An individuals rights end when the exercise of those rights cause undue harm on other individuals to exercise those same rights.

This is the very bedrock principle of our constitutional republic and the very idea of individual freedom is void without this core principle.

Wear a mask.  Get vaccinated.  Spreading the infection to others is a violations of their rights by the undue harm principle.

The SCOTUS has already decided this issue - the government can require you to get vaccinated.

Private business owners can require you to wear a mask in their business establishment.  How is not complying with their wishes not a violation of their rights as owners of a private enterprise?  They can restrict birth control from their own employees but not require their customers to wear masks?  Really?

We have health codes.  They are enforceable by law.  Just as you have to wear pants, shoes and a shirt to be allowed in most businesses, so to can you be required to wear a mask, to do that or other things such as fly on plane.

There is no constitutional right to shop at the business owned by another private individual.  There is no constitutional right to fly on a plane.

If planes can make us put up our tray tables and all our luggage under the seats, can they also not require masks and health screenings?  Are they not a private business under Citizens United entitled to essentially the same rights as individuals?

How convenient to support that selectively"
2020-07-19 00:41:16,"You always have to weigh the risks.
X-rays can cause cancer but we still use it because the benefits outweigh the risks.    We drive cars even when tens of thousands die every year because of it.

The elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, and medical personnel would benefit most from the vaccine even if there were rare side effects.  

After millions of people take the vaccine it will definitively show   whether there is a measurable risk.  

Why is it no longer acceptable to drink and drive but it is for some to walk around without a mask and possible spread a deadly disease?   The boundary of your rights ends where it starts to infringe on someone else's rights - like the right to live."
2020-07-19 00:48:25,"As a scientist with training in immunology, I would stop and think for the first time in my life-whether to have a vaccine rushed through the processes in America. I have not missed a flu shot in many decades, spent years working on Chernobyl medical problems in FSU. A vaccine after emerging through all of the usual protocols is one thing-a vaccine hyped by a president who has previously recommended bleach injections and touted the chloro-quine derivatives should give pause for consideration. I am not on the side of anti-vaxers but I am on the side of science without political intervention. We have trials ongoing in Canada and a connection to Oxford project and others. A vaccine from China may be the most reliable after all is said and done. I do not have to think about a Trump vaccine. Our borders will probably still be closed until the end of the year which will be an additional positive contribution to our already good response to this virus."
2020-07-19 00:49:36,"If we expect everything to ok with a vaccine that is ""fast tracked"" then why not ""fast track"" everything?  One of the problems is that the potential issue is the cost increase if the earlier phases wouldn't have worked but a lot of big pharmas would prefer to be the first to market.  Part of the reasons for the phased testing is to help assure that the results are worth the risks and I don't think reduced timeframe testing handles all the potential risks."
2020-07-19 01:10:14,"There are plenty of people outside of the US in desperate needs for vaccinations. To the extent the US would have surpluses due to the vaccination-doubters, the surpluses should be made available to front-line medical personnel in developing countries facing viral hotspots. Although it would be worthwhile to achieve widespread immunity here in the US, we should not turn our back on others in the world while trying to achieve that goal."

2020-07-19 01:12:53,"There is also widespread mistrust of  most News Organizations.  63% of news organizations surveyed by Rasmussen are politically Biased. Everything is so politicized that it is not surprising that there is a feeling of who do I believe. Understandably it is an election year and brain washed people do not want to think clearly for themselves. People are so hung up on a narrative that they want to believe, that their analytical thinking is affected. 

Forcing people to take a newly introduced vaccine will result in law suits if there is adverse effect from the vaccine. That said a consent form should be signed by every individual who gets immunized with full understanding of the risk benefit analysis. Big pharma has been reluctant to making vaccines. The only reason so many companies big and small have jumped in is because the Trump administration has pumped tax dollars into candidate vaccine developers."

I will either be given a placebo or the vaccine they have created, and I can’t wait to hopefully (fingers crossed) get the vaccine. Yes, I’ve read about the guy who had the bad fever for a day or so after. Sometimes people are going to have bad reactions, but you have to view it on a larger scale than just yourself. Society NEEDS a majority of people to get vaccinated.

My dad works in the COVID ICU at our county hospital as a respiratory therapist. He’s about to be on mandatory overtime because they’re getting flooded. I am far more afraid of what he has told me they’ve been seeing for months than any negative effects of the vaccine. When I asked him if I should do the study, he said “this is your chance to do something good for the world.” 

Last week he had to put his dog down. He is normally not very emotional. He said to me, “Considering all the death and destruction I’ve seen in the past few months, I thought that would be easier.” It broke my heart.

I’ll take the vaccine, thanks."
2020-07-19 01:32:04,"I understand the distrust of the federal government. I don't trust them, and I certainly wouldn't trust them with my life. Fortunately, politicians are not working on the vaccine. That task belongs solely to non-political scientists who have studied medicine and biology for decades. The reason the vaccine is being developed so quickly is because every biologist, every doctor, every person with a degree related to epidemiology is working on that vaccine. They've broken from capitalist traditions, and they're being cohesive, rather than competitive. They know that without the vaccine, the state of the world will get much worse, and by working together, they can achieve our goal quickly.

But after going through both of the above, there isn't a prayer I'm going to take any chances on a rushed trump era vaccination. I'd rather stay home, have zoom cocktail hours and hang on.  Anything the trump cdc says is suspect....anything and everything."

Mysteriously, although Trump will claim ""millions"" are taking up the offer, you and I will know of noone who has actually been been treated.

I will certainly get any vaccine that is FDA approved.  That is much more likely to protect me than the alternative of not being vaccinated.  But if other people want to put their lives on the line differently, that is their problem (or opportunity).

This is an unprecedented situation.  There will not be a one-size-fits-all fix, at least not one that everyone agrees to."
2020-07-19 01:57:30,"Like many commenters here I believe in vaccines, am vaccinated and yet cannot trust anything from the Trump
adminstration. Nor do I trust the pharmaceuticals.  For example, Moderna recently showed promise in a coronavirus vaccine trial with 45 test subjects. What I want to know is, who are the people who applied for this and were excluded? Who didn’t complete the trial? Who did but had adverse results that were conveniently dropped from the report on the 45 for essentially failing to conform to researcher bias? These are all common tactics in pharma trials."
2020-07-19 02:01:03,"Another timely article. Bravo. The reality is that I will admit that I am one of those that will not believe anything endorsed by our current regime. The fact that they blatantly court big pharma, health insurance companies, and anyone with big pockets and little scientific knowledge, will always make me oppose anything by them. That said, I do know we have brilliant minds in this country that could potentially offset my misgivings. But so much will hinge on who is in leadership, who are the messengers and how well they communicate with the very same people who will need it most. Right now, all of these areas are deficient and untrustworthy. To build this trust again, this country needs to undertake changes in power and leadership that thus far, the majority of its citizens have been unwilling to fight for."
2020-07-19 02:01:46,This is not merely a public relations problem. Skepticism about the Trump Administration’s rush to proclaim a vaccine victory is rational and justified. Remember the “bleach and light” cure? Intelligent Americans of any ideology must question the safety of a product that ordinarily requires five to ten years of testing before it is presented to the public. To say Americans have lost confidence in the current government is an understatement. It could take longer to restore the trust of the American people in our leaders than it will to defeat C19.

The ability to make it in large quantities beyond levels never done is not for sure either. We all NEED a vaccine that works. We don't have one now and we don't know when and there is no way to say when. If we knew when we don't know when I or YOU can actually get one.

We can argue how it is all going to happen when there is something to argue about. Next week works for me and I'm flexible."
2020-07-19 02:12:52,"There is an old saying about not being an early adapter of bleeding edge technology. Can't get more ""bleeding edge"" than a vaccine that normally takes years to get clearance, will have to be injected into your bloodstream and might have unexpected side affects or even be fatal."
2020-07-19 02:15:22,Do we know how effective the vaccine is expected to be?  And I would expect first responders would be first to receive it.
2020-07-19 02:23:13,"“Be neither the first nor the last to prescribe (or use) a new therapy.”

Those were the words of one of my medical school professors. A vaccine needs to be shown safe before those without disease will reasonably accept it."
2020-07-19 02:25:59,"Oh, appeal to people's sense of altruism to convince them to get a vaccine. As in, ""I wear a mask for you, you wear a mask for me""? How did that work out?"
2020-07-19 02:26:40,"I am not an anti-vaxxer, but I do not trust anything produced by this administration, particularly any vaccine rushed into production. Although I am in a higher risk group, I would wait unti, hopefully a Biden  administration came in and restored transparency and the independence and integrity of the CDC. Then I would have more confidence in being vaccinated."
2020-07-19 02:27:06,"I’m cautious about vaccines—this year will be my first ever flu shot, although I did get Shingrix, ouch!

But I signed up to be a guinea pig for any COVID-19 vaccine, should I be eligible for a trial. Yes, I’m aware of what a mess the Lyme disease vaccine was. Nevertheless, I’m old enough and ugly enough to take my chances on this one—for my sake and the sake of others."
2020-07-19 02:28:22,"Anyone aware of what has been going on in these United Plantations of America (sic) for the past 50 years would do well to be highly skeptical regarding the new COVID-19 vaccines that will be introduced here in the next 18 months.  

Well-designed clinical trials generally take years, not months, to run.  MULTIPLE large-scale clinical trials will be necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of the newly introduced vaccines.  The results of such trials are often mixed.  Recall, e.g., the repeated reversals regarding the dangers and/or powers of both caffeine and alcohol.  Also, or decades we were told that a baby aspirin a day would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; more recent work suggests otherwise. 

While it will be far easier to determine the efficacy of a vaccine than the health benefits/dangers of caffeine and alcohol, problems arise when there is a rush to market.  

In our plutocracy, profits prevail over people.  Think Boeing 737 MAX.  Wall Street mortgage securities.  The out-sourcing of jobs.  We see it with the gig economy, the lack of universal health care, the lack of investment in our children, the lack of investment in our infrastructure (Flint, MI), the lack of worker protections.  The focus is always on the health of the economy, never on the health of those doing the work.  Do you think your local plutocrat really cares if the vaccines aren’t quite right at first?  Just up the yearly quota of H1B visas.

A better vax vintage year perhaps: 2023"
2020-07-19 00:37:18,"People just need to remember that although the federal government is funding some research and the hastening of a potential COVID vaccine.

I am PRO VACCINE for polio, mmr but not given together, and some others. But NONE of the many articles calling for mandatory vaccination even MENTION figuring out who has already had Covid and most likely some better level of immunity than a vaccine could provide. They talk about scarcity and shortage of vaccines but ignore discussion of those already most certainly immune. This is especially true for people that had severe cases, like me.  But I beat it using age old remedies which are auto-dismissed by our drug company controlled government and media. Now with my breathing challenged and near zero possibility of infection or transmission, I still wear a mask when quickly passing near people outdoors. The muzzle maniacs put so much social pressure I submit. This last bit is absurd too if you know anything about viral load.  Trump should be in jail, Biden in a nursing home, so this isn't a political issue for me at all.  If these evil greedy anti-science psychopathic drug companies and ""philanthropists"" try to force a vaccine on people that have already had it or restrict our liberties beyond mask wearing...Ummm, I need to stop there as my response would be illegal."
2020-07-19 00:31:39,"I'm 60, and I'm not going near anything deemed ""ready"" this year. Always get the flu shot, still will. But not a Covid vaccine. Not in 2020. Not with 20,000 lies already."
2020-07-19 00:35:23,"This issue isn’t about Trump, who will likely be gone by the time a vaccine is approved. 

The FDA has earned every bit of the mistrust people have in them due to longstanding practices of approving drugs, devices, and treatments before their safety has been shown, and then having to recall them after thousands of people suffer or die.

Remember Fen-Phen, the weight loss drug, that killed hundreds and left others needing heart valve replacements? How about cobalt hip replacements that made people really sick? Oxycontin? I could go on and on and on….

The FDA and Big Pharma have always placed profit over the health of Americans. If they want people to trust them, do better. They will need to show that a C-19 vaccine is safe."
2020-07-19 01:01:01,"Personally, I will avoid taking any vaccine for Covid-19 until long term clinical studies are performed.  It takes years to determine how safe a vaccine is for large scale administration to the global population.   Added to any doubt about the safety of a vaccine is the fact of Trump rushing development in order to have bragging rights.  As the leader of a death cult, safety is not his primary concern."
2020-07-19 01:12:49,"I found I did not have to read the article.  I do not trust this vaccine because Mr. Trump is pushing it forward.  His record for dishonesty and self-serving behavior is obvious.  His interest is getting re-elected ay any cost, and he does not care about public health.

He is politicizing science, sideline the true experts and has not shown leadership in this crisis.  

I support vaccination, and get the flu shot each year.  I will not get the coronavirus vaccine unless I am assured of efficacy and safety by more reliable figures than Trump and his appointees ."

And after reading that Dr. Birx collaborating with the non scientific panel to tell America that the numbers of COVID-19 were not only not increasing but decreasing makes for one less previously trusted medical expert."

Maybe as a distraction from the latest disaster he has caused. Maybe Putin has a hand in it, Maybe, Maybe. But Trump has made many scenarios worse and Covid 29 is the latest and by far the most terrible. Trump has killed a whole lot of people with his fighting the experts, not wearing a mask,telling people the virus will go away, and so forth. But beware, if you believe Trump at this point you are likely to die. You need to listen to the health professionals. If you distrust vaccines, you may also die. If you won't wear a mask, you may die. You may kill others in the process. This is not something to play around with."

2020-07-19 02:37:07,"This is like a political poll. It means nothing. Folks are hesitant to use a vaccine that doesn’t even exist, yet.

2020-07-19 01:18:53,"Too many people are over-thinking this. If a vaccine is developed that wins approval by FDA and other leading medical authorities, we'd be idiots not to take ir. Trump's endorsements (or not) don't enter into it."
2020-07-19 02:52:45,"I still think that the awfulness of Covid is not really appreciated by the majority. Vaccine now being developed by Moderna (for example) is being tested on 30 thousand volunteers. While one can never exclude the possibility of a very bad 1 in a hundred thousand side effect - until millions actually get vaccinated -  such odds are much lower than the likelihood of death or severe disability from Covid infection even for the younger people.
As for the Warp Speed - the three key factors affording it are (1) much better understanding of vaccine biology today than years back when e.g. polio vaccine had been developed, (2) availability of at-risk financing (and only here the Administration had helped) to actually produce the large vaccine volumes before the testing is done so the manufacturing doesn't have to wait till the trial results are fully analysed and reviewed, and unfortunately (3) that prevalence of Covid is so high that people in the control group of the trial (who get a placebo) are likely to fall ill fast enough for the trial to be completed quickly and not take years."
2020-07-19 03:00:09,We delayed and then fumbled away a public health approach that would have kept the virus from metastasizing. A vaccine is now our only chance to beat it regardless of risk. I for one would rather die from unanticipated side effects of a vaccine that might have saved me than from the virus itself.  Better to go down fighting.
2020-07-19 03:15:10,"This is not Trump's vaccine.  This is not one vaccine.  There are many, many vaccines being developed in multiple laboratories in many countries by countless scientists.  They are not all ""warp speed.""   There are vastly different time frames.  Some are far, far from production.  The article, emphasizing ""warp speed"" and inserting Trump's name omits the larger but more objective view."
2020-07-19 03:24:36,"It is a risible stance to proclaim that the vaccine is somehow more dangerous than the actual virus.  New flash: the virus isn't going to miraculously go away.  You either get it, risk dying, or you get the vaccine.  In other news, water is wet and the sun is hot.

Secondly, the people who make vaccines are scientists and doctors.  Nobody is going to put out a vaccine that isn't vetted by clinical trials.  Translation into lay speak: if it doesn't work it won't be implemented.

Thirdly, the reason traditional vaccines take so long is that they are generally not very profitable so there are no market incentives to expedite their production.  We still make influenza vaccines in chicken eggs for Pete's sake.  That is a highly inefficient process.

In the end, I'm going to get the vaccine because I'm going to read the scientific papers and look at the data and likely come to the conclusion that the vaccine is safe and a lot better than getting the actual disease."
2020-07-19 03:26:12,"Like anything else, do your homework as far as you can and take the plunge or the shot as the case may be. I hadn't really thought about a vaccine and Trump's relationship to one and whether political considerations would become more important than medical ones. It does at least make me plan to look closer at what  is eventually approved, particularly by him."
2020-07-19 03:29:29,"“The bottom line is I have absolutely no faith in the F.D.A. and in the Trump administration”. Amen! The idea that we are all going to line up like sheep to take a ""vaccine"" that was rushed into production by the current crew in charge is insane. I will wait at least a year before I will put something in my body put out by this crew of science deniers, who are giving multi-billion dollar contracts to companies that have never produced anything like this. Only after the vaccine has proved its efficacy and safety will I comply. And I have had all of my ""shots"" too. I just do not trust this crew. And we still don't know when it will be available and what it will cost. No amount of government propaganda will change my mind."
2020-07-19 03:31:50,"I’m a full believer in vaccines as well but the expedited process is worrying. Most vaccines take 10 years to develop properly. I work in tech and one thing I know that is when management pushes an unrealistic timeline, the end product suffers.

In this case the end product is people’s lives."
2020-07-19 03:40:20,"I'm a believer in vaccines. But medicine historically has a bias in studying health issues of white men - and understudying health issues related to women and people of color. As a person of color, I would want to know that the tests of the vaccine included women and POC, and (hopefully) they/we do not face outsized risks of potential side effects. Or if we do, they need to be upfront about these risks."
2020-07-19 03:47:56,"Raising questions about the safety of an as-yet non-existent vaccine for a coronavirus is a scientific, not irrational, response. No vaccine has ever been created for a coronavirus, and this one will likely undergo an expedited safety review. The public should be asking questions. Science, not politics nor profits, should drive the speed with which such a vaccine is approved and distributed. That means adequately ensuring that whatever the side effects are, they do not outweigh the benefits.  How long that takes should be up to the scientists, not politicians."
2020-07-19 03:52:55,It may actually be a very flawed vaccine. We'll see how it goes. I think it's reasonable to be skeptical of the safety of a vaccine that is rushed to make more money for some executives and potentially get Trump reelected.
2020-07-19 03:57:56,"One needs to ask, what would be a safe vaccine. For the antivaccination group the answer would be 0 complications and 0 deaths from the vaccine. Over 600,000 people have died of this virus. For the vaccine doubters a vaccine that resulted in the death of 600 people worldwide be unsafe even if it could save the lives of 600,000. If a safe vaccine is developed quickly, it should be used. It is the responsibility of the press as well as pharmaceutical companies in the setting of a pandemic to advocate the acceptance and use of a save vaccine. While this article purports to be objective, I think it is casting doubt on the safety of any vaccine that will be developed. Just because a vaccine is developed quickly, does not mean that it is unsafe. The excruciatingly long development  of vaccines in the current era is not a reflection of the difficulty of developing a vaccine rapidly, but a reflection of the knowledge that any tiny down side of a vaccine will be met with endless litigation and its expense."
2020-07-19 04:04:51,"Is it possible that once an administration promoted and U.S. government funded vaccine development program is ""successfully"" completed and FDA approved (sort of, hurriedly) and the big pharma supplier has been paid (most important check box) for the doses of the vaccine, Trump will revert back to his old stance of being an anti-vaxer? Makes sense. He revels in 180 degree turns off the rails when some level of normalcy presents itself. All Trump is about is personal profit and being big man on campus for his supporters and donors. They probably include many of the vaccine development companies.
Once a vaccine is to market and his big pharma buddies are paid for supplying product, who cares if anyone actually gets the shot. If all one ever does is place faith in the concept that every action of the Trump administration, every single senior member, is to maximize personal profit and power, one will NEVER be disappointed.
Just like the administration's task force direction on Sunday to follow CDC guidelines to lock down the country, wear masks and social distance followed by hate tweets on Monday to liberate Democratic governed states and resist any effort to follow the CDC guidelines, I can clearly see a royal decree on Sunday that a safe and effective vaccine is ready, PAY THE SUPPLIERS, followed by a Monday tweet storm proclaiming vaccines as dangerous, DON”T TAKE IT!"
2020-07-19 04:25:34,"The distrust of Trump and his Administration is widespread.  If we're gonna have the majority of Americans vaccinated for COVID-19 two things need to happen:  
Have the man we all trust the most, Dr. Fauci, explain why it's safe and why it's so important for all to be vaccinated.  Keep Trump, Pence, Pharma executives and other appointees out of it.
Have Trump, Pence, and other Government employees vaccinated live on TV.   Even better, have them be the first to be vaccinated once it's deem safe and reliable."
2020-07-19 04:33:57,"Can we be rational about this?   It’s great that the standard road blocks which act as impediments to desperately needed medications coming to market have been loosened but we all wish for the same thing.  Proof of a Safe, Effective Vaccine with minimal side effects which provides immunity for an extended duration.  
Allow the willing, healthy population to be the test subjects initially so that those with underlying medical conditions such as Heart Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, AutoImmune disorders, etc. will acquire the confidence to receive a vaccination.   We all want our Freedom back.  This is not about any Political Party or Candidate.  It’s about the best Scientists on the Planet simultaneously and collaboratively developing an immunization which will restore the normalcy of 
our Pre-CV19 Lives."

We protect them by electing a Government we can trust. I.e., anyone but Trump."
2020-07-19 05:22:41,How does a vaccine works in a place like NYC? At over 30k deaths is NYC an outlier or were there more than a million residents infected in the city?
2020-07-19 06:54:23,"The scientists who make vaccines and the doctors who tell people to get them are without a doubt the worst communicators of any modern profession.  Getting a vaccine, when it is proven safe and effective should be a no-brainer.  The fact that we are even having this discussion reflects a total and complete failure of the scientific community to convey to the general public how safe vaccines are.

Some people seem to suggest that just because the vaccine is produced quickly means it will be done poorly.  The thing you are not considering is that most vaccines can be made quickly, there just are never any market incentives to do so.

Also, a clinical vaccine trial is really easy for most people to read and understand.  One group of people are given the vaccine, the other group a placebo (saline injection).  You wait and you see who in which group gets covid.  If there is no different the vaccine doesn't work.  If there is a large difference the vaccine is effective.

Based on the phase I clinical trial data from Moderna, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it does indeed look like a vaccine is possible by the end of the year.  Additionally, this vaccine is easier to scale up than an influenza vaccine.

Lastly, the virus isn't going anywhere.  This pandemic ends when 60% of the population has immunity.  You either do that through vaccination or natural immunity.  Natural immunity with a 0.5% mortality rate means 984,000 dead Americans.  I choose the vaccine."
2020-07-19 08:05:23,"The Achilles Heal of the U.S. is the surprisingly large number of people who are incapable of critical thought and easily swayed by the most improbable conspiracy theories. Without knowing how to think, your thinking will be done for you through ideology and / or conspiracy nonsense - often against your own interests. 

Compared to other Western nations, the U.S. has one of the largest segments of the population without a college degree. This is a nation with one of the most sophisticated scientific infrastructures in the world."
2020-07-19 08:45:20,"50 years ago people got a few vaccinations for the most serious diseases. Since then the number of vaccinations has exploded and the law of diminishing returns has set in. Most of the extra vaccinations concern diseases that cause just a few victims. 

Vaccins can have side effects. There have been quite a few scandals - mainly in poor countries. But the legislation shields the medicine industry of responsibility and as a consequence the level of testing is rather low. An additional problem is that with all those vaccinations for everyone it is almost impossible to find out when one product causes problems. The rise of ADHD and autism in the last decades may have been caused by those extra vaccinations but we don't have the tools to be sure.

Covid-19 is part of the corona virus family that is notoriously difficult to develop vaccins against. There may be long term side effects. When people are hit by a  different variety of the virus later on they might even getting sicker. 

So for me the choice is clear: the risks of a vaccin are considerably higher than the risks of getting the virus and becoming ill. I might think differently when I was 90 years old. But at the moment I am still at an age where the risks of the virus are comparably low."
2020-07-19 10:28:04,"I won't trust any vaccine promoted by Trump, who's sure to advertise it as Bigly Beneficial. He wants our votes, not our health. Just substitute the word ""Bogus"" for every claim he makes.

Assuming Biden wins, it'll take him a year or so to get trustworthy physicians, epidemiologists and other public health experts back on board. Maybe another year or so for trustworthy testing of multiple vaccines to demonstrate which are genuinely helpful.

That's when my husband and I will be vaccinated."
2020-07-19 10:33:44,"Personally I usually wait 4-6 months after the release of any new medication by the FDA, so there is a chance to see what happens in that post-release phase as general use escalates. 

I am not sure that will hold for these circumstances, given public fears and pressures--not to mention my own anxieties--and desire to travel. So we will probably need to live with a bit more uncertainty than usual (as if there isn't enough already).

Another concern is colleges and universities. Some major campuses are hotbeds of student anti-vaxxer sentiment. If there is a mandate to vaccinate how will that be enforced? Schools are already feeling significant financial pressures. Will they risk further losses or simply accept the risks to (mostly) unvaccinated students? When there is the inevitable outbreak, there will be the inevitable law suits. Will they ask unvaccinated students to sign a liability release (assuming they have no specific medical contraindications to the vaccine)? How will any of this be enforced without federal cooperation, and even with that certain red or blue states will most certainly object no matter which way this goes. 

As if there are not enough headaches."
2020-07-19 10:47:37,"In yet another of his hundreds of decisions to hurt the American people in order to get elected, this president has taken charge of a process that the world needs desperately.  Of course people won't believe him.  Why should they?

I'm a 75-year old vulnerable American who needs a vaccine in order to be safe.  But the current trials don't include seniors so my decision will be moot.  I expect to be stuck in my house for years to come."
2020-07-19 10:54:25,"I'm amazed at the lack of logic displayed by the authors and commenters. This is a good thing that will prevent a mad rush for the vaccine in the beginning. Once everyone who wants it gets it (which will take more than a year), you can move on to your focus groups. By then, if the vaccine is effective, that in itself is the best advertisement. Note that those who don't take the vaccine do not harm those who do, so there are no externalities caused by their decision. Nothing burger."
2020-07-19 12:29:42,"There is no way I am giving my children an RNA/DNA altering vaccine. It would need to be tested FOR YEARS before I do that. My family is fully vaccinated, so it’s not about not supporting vaccination - but we won’t be the guinea pigs. It’s bad enough we are sheltering at home due to a NOVEL virus, I’m not chancing a NOVEL technology. Focus the $$ on a typical vaccine protocol."
2020-07-19 12:39:33,"I thought the Tusgagee case involved the withholding of treatment not the improper vaccination. Improper vaccination was the case with the initial live virus vaccination for polio which actually gave some people polio. If the new, as yet discovered.  vaccine also relies on giving a diluted version of the virus to allow the body to produce antibodies I can understand the reluctance. I believe the CDC and the NIH are vastly overrated. They were there long before Trump. If I recall properly the Tusgagee cases were under Roosevelt administrations."
2020-07-19 12:42:12,"Nearly a hundred years ago the Supreme Court declared that mandatory vaccination was permissible as long as four standards were met.

There must be “necessity . . .; reasonable means . . .; proportionality . . .; and harm avoidance.”

Is a vaccine really necessary? This is basically a risk/benefit analysis. We know vaccines cause harm. This is why there is a separate Vaccine Court to adjudicate those claims. But do the benefits sufficiently outweigh the harm?

Will herd immunity suffice? What about mutations?

So far there is still so much we don't know about Covid that should be sorted out before mandating a vaccine.

Another aspect of ""necessity"" is an examination of alternative methods of treatment.

Despite the sparse reporting in the mass media a number of front line doctors are using successful alternative therapies, some which have had 100% recovery rates.

Then there is Taiwan, Vietnam, Iceland, Costa Rico, even Japan with much lower infection and mortality rates than the US. All accomplished without a vaccine.

Even in the US 98.5% of those infected recover and 83% of fatalities have been in people over 65. Do we really need to vaccinate everyone to protect a discrete, identifiable population?

Finally, Covid disrupts our immune system. There is no drug remedy and even a vaccine is not likely to be more than 50% effective.

Why not a national program to strengthen immunity before resorting to an expensive, medically questionable vaccine that may not be necessary?"
2020-07-19 12:44:36,"I’m not an anti-vaxxer, I believe in science (STEM graduate and STEM education advocate). I come from a family of scientists and healthcare workers, some who worked in hospitals during the HIV pandemic so understand what is going on right now. I’m not going to sign up for this first round of vaccines, nor would I want my retired parents to take it.

I equate the vaccine rollout to tech’s rollout of products to market: there are early adopters who jump on the first new product that comes their way and deal with all the bugs. I’ve never been that person. I want to see the empirical evidence that the vaccine is working and right now, the only way to see that is seeing its impact on those who take it first and actually waiting months, not days, before we draw conclusions. That’s how science works. 

The Trump administration doesn’t believe in science and that, for me, is not just troubling, it’s terrifying. If the administration changes and Biden says the vaccine is okay and shows the evidence, with the backing of his science advisers, I’ll take the vaccine. With Trump, I don’t even believe we’ll get real data. He has a track record of withholding or falsifying information so why would he change now?"

I do not want my descendants to have an extra arm because Trump was so worried about the economy he had them rush the human long term portion of the testing."
2020-07-19 05:15:24,"Apparently there were a number of patients who developed the neurological disorder Gullain Barre syndrome following a rushed influenza vaccine in the 1970s.
The difference between Covid 19 vaccines and every other vaccine is the quantum or effort and money being appropriated by every advanced country in the world. Plus, experience with vaccine development has led to breakthroughs which allow more rapid development of vaccines. Take, for example, the molecular clamp technology that holds viral proteins in their correct shape to allow an appropriate immune response. 
Donald Trump continually shocks us with stupid statements but would Hillary Clinton have saved America from Covid 19?"

No thanks, Novavax. I'm not here to act as your guinea pig after you've received $1.6B to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at ""warp speed."" Fortunately, they probably know it's impossible to improbable, but hey, what me worry with another half a billion dollars in my pocket... sez any number of pharma execs today, tomorrow, next week..."
2020-07-19 10:49:01,"That makes Dr Fauci so much more important as the last honest man - never mind he is a career medical professional - of the current government administration. Trump has poisoned the well all to well when his followers like the QAnon are paranoid to begin and the mistrust of the general population because of American history and his own history (hey, he has carried on his vendetta against President Obama with his birthism for years!)

It is heartening that Dr Fauci has stuck to science, an evident based protocol. When the new findings surfaced or uncovered, the prognosis changes"

However, *everything* DJT says is, at best, suspect and, all so  often, just a self-serving lie. If Tony Fauci vouches for a vaccine, I'm all in. If The Donald vouches for it, I'm going to take another slug of bleach and run for the hills."

Remember the swine flu? I don't trust the effectiveness  either. The only person I would trust is Dr. Fauci and then only if he gets the vaccine himself and his wife. Otherwise I will continue to stay home, socially distance myself, wear a mask and practice good hygiene."
2020-07-19 03:38:18,"So it’s Trump’s fault that a vaccine for a pandemic we have not seen in our lifetime is being developed as fast as possible? If it wasn’t being worked on at record speed, can you imagine the outcry? This is par for the course, NYT.

And it’s nothing new that people are afraid of vaccines and some won’t take them. But unless there is a better alternative, we all will have to make a decision that we take the vaccine and risk potential side effects or don’t take it and risk getting COVID. There is no simple answer."
2020-07-19 03:38:50,"If Trump is pushing the vaccine I will be even more leery.  His administration is flagrantly dishonest, slipshop, unprofessional, and lacking a bit in the ethics and expertise departments.

If they mandate it and make it mandatory then good luck with that i still will not comply...."
2020-07-19 10:03:47,"I generally trust science and scientists. I loathe Trump and would not trust him for one second. That said, he does not really have power over the process the scientists are carrying out. Yes, he can push for speed. His silly label, ""warped speed,"" is political and silly, but it is not where scientists are. I believe that whatever ends up being brought to the public will be, at the minimum, reasonably safe (NO medicine or vaccine is 100% safe as there is always the very, very rare idiosyncratic reaction). 

I will get the vaccine when it is offered. For me the question is about effectiveness. Safety they can check in a short term, but effectiveness, especially the length of immunity, cannot be tested in a few months.  Only time will tell that - time during which we wait to see who gets sick even having been vaccinated or who still has antibodies and for how long. That means that if we care about ourselves and each other, we will all be wearing masks and distancing for at least another year or two..."
2020-07-19 02:50:56,"A vaccine like this would normally take 10-20 years to come to market with a significant amount of that time set aside to monitor safety, long-term effectiveness and long-term issues. If you are releasing it in a year to 18 months, you are not taking any of those things in to account and, quite frankly, you'd be mad to get it. I am all in favour of vaccines but they need to be given time; something, I acknowledge, that is lacking at the moment but, to use a horrible cliché - you don't want the cure to be worse than the disease."
2020-07-19 04:33:19,"I must admit that every morning since he took office, I reach for the MacBook next to my bed to check and see if Trump is dead yet. That's all I really care about. And since I assume there are many like me, it is incomprehensible to me that he continues to wake up naturally, without any wounds or physical restraints, in the same place where he went to sleep (or connected to his power port or whatever it is that he does) the night before. Evidently, there was never any Plan B backup if impeachment failed to end this nightmare. Ouch!"
2020-07-19 08:43:04,"You want to get people to comply and be vaccinated?

Make it criminal for any business to hire or re-hire any of the millions of Americans thrown out of work by the pandemic without proof of vaccination.  Furthermore, any of the businesses that accepted forgivable loans should be made to pay them back, woth interest, if they do not comply.

Landlords can be forced to refuse to rent to those without that proof, and stores and restaurants can be ordered to refuse service.

Enough with this coddling of the ignorant."

My issue with the vaccines being developed to treat COVID-19 relates to President Trump, his motives, his lies, and his disrespect for science.  If he recommends a vaccine, I will not feel comfortable taking it."
2020-07-18 17:06:10,Vaccination should be required by law within 6 months of availability for everyone over an age recommended by the CDC. No excuses unless someone has a documented medical condition that could cause serious complications. Everyone should have a government-issued document (a card or on a cell phone) that must be shown upon request in any public place or by a police officer. Failure to get vaccinated or failure to have proper documentation should be punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Stop allowing irresponsible people to wreck life for the rest of us! Freedom is everyone getting vaccinated!
2020-07-19 14:31:42,"These wildly optimistic projections are absurd. 

A vaccine against an RNA virus has never been approved. 35 years have passed since HIV was discovered to inject its DNA into cell nuclei, and we still don’t have an AIDS vaccine. The biotechs puffing up their stock are fooling hedge-fund quants who couldn’t distinguish a microscope from a bronchoscope. 

Trial and error controls vaccine development, and the soonest we’ll have one is 2025. I defy anyone else who had/has a career in the field to give me reasons to think the current situation can defy gravity in ways all previous vaccines could not."
2020-07-19 14:57:38,"If Trump and his family, his staff, cabinet and their families, and Mitch McConnell and his family, then the Republicans and their families, get the vaccine first and are Okay,  then maybe I will consider it.

2020-07-19 15:13:23,"Complete transparency as to financial interests in any vaccine  of doctors, research companies, and drug companies would go a long way towards creating people's faith in the integrity of the vaccine.  Full disclosure of financial interests in the development, manufacture and distribution of any vaccine should be required."
2020-07-19 16:19:51,"One more reason, among thousands, that we must vote Trump out in November.  The public health and economic carnage will snowball into an avalanche if a vaccine rollout is botched - which is highly likely given this administration’s dismal track record."

Vote."
2020-07-19 15:02:39,"I don't think I would put my ultimate trust in a vaccine that was developed at ""warp speed"", especially since there are so many other issues too. Look, SARS, MERS, the common cold, and more, are all corona-type viruses, and no effective vaccine has been developed against these illnesses.  

A lot of the pressure to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 comes from the economic front.  But the whole economic situation is entirely a man-made issue, as a fear-driven response to a virus that, although contagious, is not ultimately as deadly as is being painted.  If you look at the figures here  

<a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate"" target=""_blank"">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate</a>/

you will see the fatality rates for SARS and MERS are way higher than the initial figures that we have for Covid, yet society was not shut down for those pandemics.  It was only when the word ""pandemic"" started to be used that fear swept the world and lockdown seemed the appropriate action.

So, let's assume that a small number of the vaccines currently under development do make it through to market, and also that they are relatively effective.  What everyone is forgetting is that the purpose of this vaccine is not necessarily to prevent people from getting sick, but its not-so-hidden agenda is that society should ""get back to normal""   But to do this, all the restrictions placed on us would have to be lifted or lessened, and the people in charge of doing that are governments.  Power, once grabbed, is not easliy surrendered."
2020-07-19 02:49:54,"The president and his administration don t care if Americans live or die or suffer or grieve or lose everything they have .
So how could anyone trust that he’s involved with, a vaccine timed to get him reelected  ?

He s already contributed to the deaths of thousands of Americans— it’s unbelievable to think an American president is doing that but he is. 

Surely he wouldn't care how many more Americans he had to harm, this time with an unsafe vaccine, so that he can satisfy his appetite for power."
2020-07-19 14:21:09,"When a safe vaccine is developed I will get it. But there's the rub.... It's got to be safe. Right now the head of our government is a man who is a proven liar. The government is responsible for making sure the vaccine is safe. Do the math: A proven liar plus cowed heads of various US health departments minus the silenced voices of various government scientists who cannot speak out equals a questionable product. 

I will be far more eager to take a vaccine that has been developed in Europe, Australia, or New Zealand."
2020-07-19 14:36:24,"Could hesitation to trust the vaccine possibly be because the present leadership has unilaterally Pooh-poohed the scope of Covid and then is championing a company that has never brought a successful vaccine to market? And to add insult to injury, spent billions of taxpayer dollars that could have aided those suffering the economic impact and caused millions more deaths.   All this cuz he wants to “win” an election to an office that he has proven he doesn’t really want any responsibility for. 

I will support vaccination when a vaccine is produced by a nation whose support of  science and medicine produces a vaccine that will be effective, and not an empty campaign prop. And in the meantime, our leadership should be under investigation for crimes against humanity. Tens of thousands of life’s have been lost and more at risk because of the negligence and ego of this president."
2020-07-19 16:06:05,"If you have Trump bangin' the Drum for a new vaccine you had better get behind the scenes and find out who will be profiting.
And just the idea of him (Trump) promoting it will kill much willing participation. If he is smart at all (not) he should realize this - but he won't. His ego won't let himself stand off to the sidelines."
2020-07-19 13:10:29,"Can you blame people for being hesitant, when we know the real rush is Trump wanting to get reelected? 

And how can we trust drug companies, when scandal after scandal shows us that their primary motivation is to make as much money as possible.

I'm all for a vaccine, but am not champing at the bit to be a guinea pig. Although I'm in a high-risk category, I'm also blessed to be retired, with sufficient income to sit this out for a while. I'll get my seasonal flu shot, but until I see that there are no glaring side-effects, I'm happy to mask up, hand-sanitize all the time, and stay at home."
2020-07-19 15:49:21,"Sadly, there is legitimate concern, not about vaccines only, but about all prescription medications. This is caused by a system that's corrupted by Big Pharma money and which allows the industry to do things it should not. We should acknowledge and  address these systemic problems now and work now to rebuild the confidence Americans.

I want so much to have a Covid-19 vaccine--but I also want to get the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which is mentioned several times in the article, yet I haven't. Why?
1. In clinical trials, Shingrix was not associated with serious adverse events.
2. But people with with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, were excluded from the clinical trials. So if you're one of the 25 million or so Americans, you don't know if the vaccine is safe for you.
3. In fact, the CDC says,""While Shingrix is not contraindicated in immunocompromised persons, it is not recommended by ACIP at this time."" 
  Not one of my doctors seems to know this. They've told me it's a dead virus, thus safe. But Shingrix has a powerful adjuvant, never used before.
4. We now get vaccinated vs chickenpox, so the market for Shingrix is short-term: people who've had chickenpox. But it's huge dollars in profit.
5. Benefits are given in relative numbers, but adverse effects in absolute numbers--a form of lie. 97% effective does NOT mean that only 3% get the disease. 

Many more things to cause distrust. I'm pro-vaccine, but we deserve to know the truth. Laws need changing."
2020-07-19 15:44:25,"I take issue with the headline, both with the one currently online and the one in today's print edition. What would imperil widespread immunity is not ""mistrust,"" but botched, rushed development by companies, some with no track record of actually bringing vaccines to market, who receive millions of taxpayer-funded payouts from a corrupt and ignorant administration simply because they agree to a timetable based more on magical thinking (witness the term ""Warp Speed"") than biomedical science."
2020-07-19 03:17:49,"Well, on hand there is real reason to be worried about a vaccine rushed to the market for mass use, especially if it's from a novice vaccine researcher...

On the other hand, there won't be enough to go around, so the non-believers can hold back and those who want and need it get it.

Later, and only if the vaccines tests out,everyone can be required to get it or they can go into quarantine and stay by themselves.

That's the ""new"" freedom we'll get to enjoy; freedom from the idiots in America!"

Until Feb 26 of this year, I lived for 5 years in Mumbai - in one of their poshest areas. 

 I could see the $billion apartment of India`s richest man from my balcony.

Even, in that rarefied society, I am glad I left.

The filth, crumbling apartments and folks packed in a single dwelling - and worse - the attitude that rules apply only to others.

Of course, this virus will spread.

The article does not mention some details below.

The government lulled people with this nonsensical Unlock 1.0 and 2.0 etc.

As if its a software package that Indians tell the world they are best at.

Any common man seeing this terminology will think there is somebody else helping when it is they who have to work at it.

BBC is carrying extensive reporting on these failures which include : government telling folks yoga will help, a government favorite Yogi or a scamster telling Ayurvedic medicine will cure etc.

All of course - with no scientific basis.

And hence this grim milestone."
2020-07-17 14:06:37,"They have a monumental task ahead of them. Once again, as in US, the national leadership failed. Local governments are doing a better job. Thus the enormous differences in infections rates across India. Local reports suggest that many do not really wear masks or maintain social distancing. The lower death rate makes them even bolder. Again no different than the US. Modi made a bold promise that a vaccine will be ready on August 15th without checking with his scientists. US, India and Brazil - similar leaders and similar catastrophe."
2020-07-17 13:55:57,"What is most striking about this article is not the surge in cases in India, which might have been expected, but rather the fact that the US still has more cases than a country with 1.3 billion people."

Look at the issues with testing that continue here in the U.S. Does anyone think they really know how many infections have occurred here? Throwing meaningless statistics around is not good journalism."
2020-07-17 16:37:46,you cannot write that India has third highest covid cases after the US and Brazil by comparing raw case numbers. you must use percapita numbers.
2020-07-17 14:13:36,"This virus was going to go once around the world, at the least, once it escaped its place of origin via air-travel.

It has reached the literal ends of the earth. That is a reflection of how much human beings travel, especially via the airplanes that are really poorly focused on hygiene!

India is a country with more than thrice the population of the USA with a third of the landmass. It also has mass transit reaching all its corners - as did the virus.

The malignancy of this virus regarding mortality is not as bad as other microbes involved in epidemics/pandemics past.

India, like the USA, does not have the medical infrastructure needed to manage the sheer volume of its patients; most will not make to a medical facility.

No country is prepared for such wide-spread infections needing serious hospitalizations in such volume.

There are not enough doctors, nurses and other medical personnel on earth to manage a pandemic of this magnitude.

There are enough human beings, all of them, on earth who could practice hygiene properly to survive florid infections. 

Hopefully, the patients who survive have enough immunity to it long enough to tide over the coming year. Wishing for permanent immunity after an infection is what the medical world wants.

Lock-downs are speed-bumpers, just enough to slow the infection rate to manage the sick.

India has no PPP; expecting a permanent shut-down for the entire duration of the pandemic is not possible.

Social hygiene is the only answer."
2020-07-17 14:13:49,"The data is wrong, according to many who work in healthcare field in India.

The sudden lock down announced by Modi government and certain state governments have very high adverse impact on the poor people.

One of the states, Kerala, also sold a ""Kerala Model"" to the world by by wasting taxpayers money.  

Even The Washington Post, reproduced a content wrote by the Communist-Marxist state government of Kerala, without any verification of facts by deviating its journalists ethics and standards.  

Now that state's (Kerala) model for the world has crumbled as there are no isolation beds and facilities available to meet the surge as the government announced originally. 

Still the Kerala's chief minster (equivalent to a governor in the U.S.) did not admit that there has been community spread and the surge in cases is out of control for the state government.  

And Kerala's chief minister forcefully conducted two examinations for the students, one such exam yesterday, thereby students, parents, and others broke the triple lock down guidelines.  

Heavy rains, filth, lack of waste disposal systems, etc., would further aggravate the current situation."
2020-07-17 13:55:17,India is third only because it has conducted a fraction of the testing  as compared to the US.
2020-07-17 18:18:04,"Does the article care to mention that more than 60% of people have recovered? Nice job mentioning Kerala selectively. There are plenty of governments which did a good job, some not so good. However, the overall response at political level has been unified and less politicized. The early ""lockdown"" had near unanimity among all political parties.
Yes things could have been handled better, yes these was mismanagement and yes its a big set back economically specially the poor. Doesn't mean its all gloom and doom and that everything was ""preventable"" by any government."
2020-07-17 18:23:45,"@Neil, the US has tested 45 million people. India 12 million. The USA is testing roughly 3.5x the number of people that India is.

India says it has 1 million positive cases. Let us multiply that by 3.5 to account for the reduced testing. So, India and the US likely have roughly the same number of positive cases.

The difference is that India has a population density of 455 people per square km. The US number is 36, which is less by a factor of 12.

Taking these numbers into account, if the Indian government was only as effective as the US government, India should have been reporting 12 million cases by now (even with its reduced testing rates). It is reporting 1 million - what does that tell you?"
2020-07-17 20:36:41,"It’s a nearly impossible situation in India.
In a small town in southern state of Telangana where my extended family lives, there was one case from a recent travel to Hyderabad, a large city with high infection rate. The local municipal officials quarantined the whole street and de-sanitized it. That’s a lot more than what I had expected, in fact more than what’s being done in most of California.
I made a trip to Italy on virus research and when I got back, the CDC made me fill a form. Nobody contacted me after that. 
India had done quite well, given the circumstances.
Public buses are quite popular mode of transportation there. It’s impossible to trace contacts as people use cash to purchase tickets and no record exists with personal information. Same situation with street vendors.
Their best hope at this point is herd immunity.
I see that NYT doesn’t want to give any credit to the government there - tribalism and bias is clouding your judgment!"
2020-07-18 00:41:06,""" About 25,000 deaths have been officially attributed to Covid-19, but testing remains sparse, so the real figure  could  be significantly higher."" 
      Testing is the key to fight coronavirus but India's testing rate is very low even though in absolute number of tests India stands second to USA. ( Total number of tests USA 46,531580 and India 13,072,718. Tests per 1 million population USA  140542 and India only 9469 ) 
     India does not have enough testing kits for its 1.3 billion population. Testing is expensive about 4500 rupees per test, Without enough test kits, India is using a gigantic surveillance network to trace and quarantine infected people. That is the best India can do to control this pandemic. 
   When compared to many countries the death rate due to the coronvirus in India is significantly low. India claims a low death rate due to coroavirus both as a percenatge of total cases and per million population. The Indian government has cited the figures repeatedly to reassure a worried populace. 
     But many experts disagree on government data on death rate since a large majority of to people die in rural areas and without any medical attention, making them less likely to be tested or diagnosed. Still I believe that death rate could be lower for at least one reason, that is the age advantage, only 6.5 percentage of Indians are above 65 years old. USA that number is above 12 percent."
2020-07-17 10:03:16,"The country is swamped with disease with little end in sight, and still some need to roll the dice.

The virus is unpredictable in its symptoms/consequences. 

Until a vaccine exists, we must avoid any notions of a normal life."
2020-07-17 10:09:30,"I can empathize with the couple in the article. We, too, cancelled our summer vacation to upstate NY. I'm lower 60s, husband mid-70s....just not worth the worry. No good hospital system nearby if something DID happen. Keeping our fingers crossed for next summer....being very aware that the situation could be the same or worse."
2020-07-17 10:23:57,"We are in our mid-70's.  The problem with travel is what will be open when you do go someplace: museums, theater, concerts, etc.  If we can't get there with our camper van, then we aren't going.  We won't stay in hotels or VRBOs.  No airplanes or public transportation for us for the foreseeable future."
2020-07-17 10:31:19,"Many at-risk persons, over 65, or under 65 with vulnerabilities are planning on remaining pretty much in isolation, which is nice if you have the choice. Too many do not. They have to work in low-paying jobs which they travel to by public transportation. They have to fear the horrible people who refuse to perform the most basic decency of wearing a mask. There is no safety net for them and their families. The cost of food delivery is prohibitive. Having one healthy child and one with vulnerabilities is a balancing act that most of us could not imagine, much less handle. To pretend that having to postpone a lovely vacation is heart-breaking is to ignore reality. Try serving patrons who do not care whom they infect. Try being a working mother who takes care of parents and a child with a compromised immune system. But when you ignore science, ignoring the plight of others is easy. Welcome to the ""great"" america of donald and his minions."
2020-07-17 10:35:25,"We have developed a routine where we feel safe having close contact with a very limited circle of friends (less than 10) who we know are staying as safe as we are.  We will socialize outdoors at a safe distance with some other friends and neighbors.   And we always wear masks in public.   We are missing all the musical events and travel that we loved in our retirement years, but we are finding vicarious enjoyment and discovering new artists online.   We are enjoying restaurants that have outdoor seating widely spaced.   Life continues safely with these modifications."
2020-07-17 11:00:25,"There is one absolutely critical stat that is trivial to produce but missing: separating risk for free-living elders from those in care facilities.

The horrible experience for older folks in nursing homes (which greatly distort the disease averages) should not be conflated with the experience of healthy older people at home.

We desperately need to know for free-living older people: if you get infected, how are your odds of needing hospitalization different than younger cohorts and if hospitalized, odds of needing ICU or ventilator care, and of death."
2020-07-17 11:01:16,"""But their approach also assumes that older adults’ only interest lies in not dying.""

There's a lot to be said for that, particularly when the prospects of death are so high and the method of death is so gruesome since it is in effect akin to a slow strangulation.

M.I.T. has got it right when they ""proposed protecting people over 65 by having them isolate for an estimated 18 months until a vaccine becomes available""."
2020-07-17 11:12:34,"And what happens if there is no vaccine in 18 months? Is life worth living in complete isolation for seniors who live alone? Not for everyone, I expect."
2020-07-17 11:14:31,"What is not mentioned in this article are the people fleeing high covid rate states. I am less safe now than I was because of all the very noticeable surge of cars from AZ, GA, etc that are not normal summer visitors. They are supposed to quarantine for 14 days. They do not. As a consequence I am staying in except for walks outdoors. So it is not just geography but the movement of people from other states."
2020-07-17 11:22:27,"I used to live in Houston TX. Parlayed property there for a very old and very large home in a small town in the foothill of the Blue Ridge mountains. I live in a large park basically, like a permanent vacation. I cannot believe my good fortune. The corona virus is bad in SC but not so much in Occonee  county where I live   
While I am very secluded with my husband and son and we are very , very, VERY careful when going out for essentials we are retired and have always been homebodies. (Son works from home). 
I think about the beloved people I left behind in Houston and despair for them. My daughter Is in Boston, and is an artist. We stay in close touch, and try to keep spirits up via frequent messaging and chats on the phone and so also with friends. We will stay as safe as we can.
This will not be over for a long, long time, and when we emerge from it, we will not be the same. We hope for the best, prepare for the worst and plan to risk an outing to VOTE!
This would have been so much better handled by a woman. It is costing us dearly. I only hope my beloveds can make it through to VOTE too."
2020-07-17 11:40:18,"I’m 70-plus. There is one general principle I recommend for everyone that cuts through a lot of the assumed complexity of how to deal with coronavirus: the more people you are around, the more likely you will get Covid-19. The fewer, the less. Simple and to the point.

You might also think about Russian roulette. The odds are in you favor every time you pull the trigger. The problem is what happens the one time they’re not."
2020-07-17 11:54:53,"I think the MIT model has a more sane approach.  We are upside down totally.  Most retirees lives have changed very little and, at the income bracket on display here, in merely frivolous ways.  A canceled vacation.  
At lower income levels, grandparents are assuming more risk than would be necessary in an open economy because they have to be child care providers because schools are all closed (even though vacation is open?). 
And in the segment of the population at the lowest risk from Covid (or even for transmisting Covid),which is also the most crucial age for socialization, we have kids locked in rooms with computers."
2020-07-17 11:59:38,"I consider myself extremely lucky- I moved out of my NJ home after 33 years to NH last July.

It took every ounce of strength to leave family and friends for a quieter life, sort my priorities out and head 350 miles away.

In our 60's, with some health issues, we've been quite careful.  We're in an area with no county deaths, no hospital cases,
with beautiful scenery to enjoy while we've laid low.

Consequently, tourists have jammed our town for the summer, snapping up homes within hours of being listed, and we avoid mingling as much as possible when downtown, shopping off-times and staying masked around others. 

 I miss my son in LA who refuses to take a chance on a 6 hr plane ride to visit this summer, but I appreciate his concern to avoid inadvertently infecting us. My other son took a test, flew up last week on a 2 hr trip, and we enjoyed outside activities daily for a week.  

While I don't want to isolate for another year (or more), even though the death rates are extremely low, I don't want to take a chance of getting this virus or giving it to my husband.  
 
Everyone's life has been affected by this- we may be in a different boat, but it's the same storm.

We can only hope that the medical pros working on vaccines and treatment will have some lightbulb moments shortly."
2020-07-17 12:09:07,"At 74, with kidney disease, diabetes, I have not been in a store since March 15.  A younger sister in Michigan, died from Covid in April. A planned week at the beach in June with kids and grandkids, was them and my wife, I stayed home."
2020-07-17 12:19:36,"I’m 70, living alone, in good health with no conditions but age that would make me vulnerable to the virus. I also have been working remotely since our small office closed four months ago. Recently we were asked to return to work onsite 50% of the time. Protocols were in place with staggered work schedules, sanitizers, temperature taking etc. I was shocked, day after day, to find security guards doing temp checks without masks, younger people walking the halls without masks, and no safe ventilation system in place. When the person I share a workspace with - hired by her mother who heads Human Resources - decided to just show up on my day, I left the premises for my own safety. Imagine my further dismay to then learn that the Mayor of my tourist town won’t mandate masks for people, most from out of state, walking in and out of stores on Main St.

So what does an older person like me do? If we have to work and value our safety we could get fired by the organization that doesn’t want to be responsible itself, puts all its employees at risk yet puts the ‘blame’ on us for being older. The decisions we have to make to insure our safety and continue to make a living and the anxiety we live with can be daunting. My sleepless nights are about that as much as about getting sick alone."
2020-07-17 12:20:11,"Although old and with co-morbidities my husband and I are loners. Always were, always will be. Now that we are both retired, as long as I have a book to read, a garden to tend and he an old movie to watch we are quite happy by ourselves.

2020-07-17 12:27:28,"I'm 68. I have been nonplussed all along by the outcries of
 "" We're in the vulnerable group."" seeming to mean just being over 65. These folks are definitely not as tough as the WWII generation that were their progenitors. The idea that I will just need to stay home for 18 months is ludicrous. I have worn a mask all along and limited my trips. I live in a very hot climate but I air the house out every morning while it is cool. I know that it is a bad disease and a suffering death-my daughter is an I.C.U. nurse so I have no illusions. But it is not smallpox and 50% of people who get it are not going to die in a few days. I think that cancelling vacations and staying off public transportation is probably good sense for people of all ages at present. Why we did not all start wearing masks 4 months ago while out and about is beyond me. This is the greatest public health failure of the past 100 years.  People are dying, schools are shut, businesses going under, borders are shut, young people are graduating into a world without jobs and lots of needed medical care is postponed. If we just had limited breathing on each other which is doable ! Telling all the "" free living elders "" to stay home ( for 18 months !) is not getting to the heart of the problem. It just seems like one more distraction from the reality that our public and private health care system is very broken and inequitable."
2020-07-17 12:30:33,The saddest part of the situation is that it was avoidable. Europe and Asia took the necessary steps and are re-opening. Much of the US refused to implement basic measures. NY and Gov. Cuomo are the gold standard and their lessons were ignored. Leaders who refuse basic public health messages should be removed from office and face criminal charges of public endangerment.

We have also cancelled all plans of travel.

So, what to do:
 - Increase the charity budget, we found a local need and set up a matching campaign. Making calls to other friends to invite participation is a great way to catch up
 - Get politically involved. I now have more Zoom invites for organizing than I have time time for.
 - In the words of Buddha, ""Get outside the castle."" We connected with the bartender who provided excellent service and we got to know when we were in Manhattan last January. He and his family have been hunkered down in Brooklyn since March with jobs long gone. We are assisting their family with covering the rent. Their lives are not only different, they are difficult."

I am lucky and live in Massachusetts where 99% of population wear masks. We can also open our windows a lot because we don't have to use AC all the time. I don't go to restaurants either inside or out. I do get take out and then eat with one other friend outside.I live alone so the winter and spring were hard,not able to see grandchildren except at a distance.Myself and friends will continue mostly distancing until there is a vaccine. Everyone has to make their own decisions but the least everyone can do is wear a mask."
2020-07-17 12:41:20,"This article completely misses the real issue with COVID deaths among the elderly:  nursing homes!

Half of all deaths nationally are due to residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  This is due to spreading by low-paid nursing assistants and orderlies, who typically work odd hours in multiple facilities.  All such workers need to have their temperatures taken every day.

One other thing that elderly residents of nursing homes should be doing is taking Vitamin D supplements, 1000-2000 IU/day.  Recent research has shown a very strong correlation between low Vitamin D level and the severity of COVID.  This can save lives!"

On the other hand, we are being encouraged to go out and help local businesses. Cases are surging. But, to be honest, I don't know anyone who has had Covid-19; only a few friends of friends who have been effected. Masks seem like a simple way of allowing more freedom -- to go out, to see others, to prevent the spread of disease but has become a weird political issue. It's all very confusing."
2020-07-17 12:46:41,"My husband and I are over 65, and are healthy and active. We've been isolating since March, and we go nowhere. I filled my gas tank yesterday for the first time since February. So what can we do? Every year we go canoe camping in the Adirondacks in NY, and we're thinking about a 3-night trip mid-week near the end of July.  Once we're there, we're totally isolated, but it is a 7-hour drive.  NY is doing so well, with new cases and deaths even lower than Pennsylvania.  Cross fingers that we can go."
2020-07-17 12:49:00,"Yes, there are lots of us 65+'ers who are making these benefit/risk calculations.  The NYT had a piece a couple months ago where they presented the risks of different types of businesses graphically--that was extremely useful for decision making and I'd suggest those reporters update and republish that analysis.

Now we're living in coastal DE--have to figure out how to update the location in my signature.  DE was doing pretty good vis a vis the virus, and then the tourist season started.  We've patronized restaurants via take-out, hoping to help them avoid going out of business.  Just one sit-down restaurant meal since this started--at a place that consists of an outdoor deck overlooking the ocean. No haircut in 5+ months--hair appearance doesn't register much on the benefit side of the equation at my age.  Big grocery trips spaced 2 weeks apart take care of need while minimizing exposure.  Brief visits to Home Depot and the like, because the risks there are pretty low.  Trips to places like NYC for shows and high end restaurants are sorely missed.

The total lack of a coordinated Federal response for Covid-19 is, for me, criminal.  No one in the W.H. or at presidential appointee level (with few exceptions--e.g., NIH Director Collins) should ever have any public or private role that requires responsibility again, since they've washed their hands of responsibility and just about every other positive human trait during our 3+ year long debacle."

So if the Trump Administration has been giving a false or over optimistic message concerning the pandemic as many media organizations including the NYT have been pushing since March, then what’s different about this New York Times article?

The answer is nothing is different. However, since NYT’s over zealous disdain for President Trump since the 2016 election is well documented in the NYT’s own archives, so if the message that the President and his administration has been “deadly” then the NYT is equally and directly contributing to the harsh realities of the pandemic by publishing this article. When this NYT article includes statements that people at risk need to assess their own circumstances, there is an underlying suggestion of go ahead and “take” the risk, because you might have other interests other than dying."

As an outsider, it's amazing to think that intelligent citizens would not know the answers to all of this by now (no blame being assigned other than at the top - speaking of which I gather the WH has removed the CDC stats from their website.) It's astounding to to the outside world. Reeks of banana republic.

That said, it's easy for me to say because I have trusted sources of information in Canada. Not that we will fare any better in coming surges - and there will be - no smugness here, we have anti-maskers and the whole nut bar youtube-as-news gang here also. 

But honest to god, what's a literate person in the US to do? I'd say, listen to Dr. Fauci. CNN has good doctors on also - Dr. Wen and Dr. Gupta. And for really good and balanced news, check The Guardian and CBC Canada. When you're not reading the NYT of course."

There are no guarantees ever that disaster cannot strike and older folks understand this concept.  Each person needs to find a way to stay involved, study on ways to stay safe, maintain a regular schedule, and find something pleasurable to do each day.

BUT BUT BUT BUT , this is the most important part,  do NOT despair if you should catch it.   While many of my patients have been sickened,  far more shrugged it off quite easily.   Statistically speaking MOST of the deaths were in these risk groups, but do not foget that MOST people in these risk groups will be just fine after the infection.   We tend to look at the risk from assessing who got sick and died.  We often forget to look at the patients who got sick and lived!   Be safe and cautious but stay realistic about the risks.

2020-07-17 13:29:18,"For an 80 year-old, 18 months of lockdown is a heavy price to pay as it very well could mean lockdown until death.   This discussion of risk, therefore, has to include more than individual risk of becoming ill with covid-19; it must also include the risk that the elderly individual spends the entirety of his remaining life (or a very large percentage) stuck in his home away from family and friends. Yes, the social benefit of reduced hospitalizations is in the equation too, but all risks must be considered."
2020-07-17 13:31:12,"My husband and I, at 83 years, are in the same boat as many other financially stable and healthy older people who responded to this article.  It is with grateful hearts that we enjoy living comfortably in our own large home, not in a senior facility or nursing home.  Our park-like back yard with old trees, garden flowers, birds, bunnies, ground hogs and deer are a source of both pleasure and work.  Though we had to give up our annual family vacation reunion in Maine this summer,  I can relive memories with photographs of past ones posted on Facebook to the delight of grandkids who enjoy recalling their childhood memories of fun in coastal Maine.  We are grateful that all our middle-aged children are still working, mainly on-line, but their children, in college or graduated, are limited in career prospects just at the stage in life when fulfilling ambitions and dreams was about to happen.  It is their future, both professional and as citizens of this dying democracy and dying planet that we mourn...not our ""golden years"" tarnished by the pandemic as it may be."
2020-07-17 13:46:02,"If more Americans were consistent in wearing masks, observing the physical distancing rules, and not seeing taking precautions as a political statement some of the extreme caution we're seeing would not be necessary.  We would not be witnessing a resurgence in California, new hot spots and shortages of PPE, etc.  

Yes, life is full of risks.  But we have an administration and a number of governors who think that chaos is best.  So we're left to make our own decisions based upon a lack of good information.  This is what we get when we vote for people who vow to shrink the government:  bad government.

Wear a mask.
Wash your hands.
Keep your distance.
Laugh a little every day."
2020-07-17 13:49:40,"An otherwise healthy friend in his 70s just underwent a totally elective open-heart operation (asymptomatic mitral valve repair). So far, so good, but he just played Russian roulette. I think he was foolhardy. I'm not enjoying isolation, but I am reading more, learning more, thinking more, and doing other things in hopes of surviving to spend several more years enjoying ""real"" life after this passes. This is a time for prolonged patience, lest we all become short-lived patients."
2020-07-17 13:49:59,"Elders now know the risks.
If they choose to leave their homes, they assume the risk. They have the right to make that decision. 

Once they leave their house for anything other than food or medicine, though, they lose the right to worry or insist that other people undergo draconian measures to keep them safe.  

Just do not go out in public to nonessential places and then complain about what other people in those places are doing.
  
If the virus is airborne and can be absorbed by your eyes, all of the masks in the world will only a make a tiny difference.  Elders are responsible for keeping themselves safe."
2020-07-17 14:05:53,"Living in Arizona, where it's been in the triple digits most days, I'm  stuck in the house from 9 a.m. til bedtime anyway.  I swim or walk and go to the grocery store very early in the morning.  It's always like this in the summer.  I live by myself and am 75 with no health problems.  I call friends most days.  The anxious part for me is listening to and reading the news."
2020-07-17 14:10:14,"Arizona has the dubious distinction of experiencing the highest per capita incidence of COVID in the US. In fact, statewide, we have fewer than 200 ICU beds meaning we are overwhelmed. Nevertheless, republican Gov Doug Ducey refuses to implement stringent measures that have mitigated the disease in other states. Such a position is counterproductive to the safety of all people, especially seniors, but it's counterproductive for business which is that segment republicans are supposed to represent.

I call upon Gov Ducey to revise his stance, learn from NY Gov Cuomo, and implement policies so Arizonans can shop and enjoy this beautiful place."
2020-07-17 14:12:37,The Cleveland Clinic calculator produces suspicious results.  After putting in my info... I got a result of 1.8%... encouraging.   I tinkered with it... I've never smoked.  The result if I was a former smoker is: 1.5% and as a current smoker: 0.5%. Cigarette companies must love this news.  I don't believe it.

We had planned a trip to see them in April. That of course didn’t happen. We had a flat secured and British Airways vouchers for a rescheduled trip in December. That trip will not happen. Too soon to be in airports or airplanes. We used to think travel was essential. Right now, a vaccine is essential before travel can resume that position."
2020-07-17 14:21:34,"Going “shopping” is a big NO! for me. As a cancer survivor, my sinuses are gone, removed during two separate surgeries. With zero filtration, air that comes through either mouth or nose, takes the same path: in and straight to the lungs. Mask is not even a question, it is a requirement. Food is either at home (home-cooked meal delivery) or curbside. Even curbside has risks, if I see missing masks, I walk away. Hungry beats dead. Apart from frequent outdoor walks (rural path), I am in lockdown mode, and will be for a while."
2020-07-17 14:22:45,"The headline reads, ""How Do You Calculate Coronavirus Risk...?""  According to the article, as states and cities reopen, re-close, etc., ""the calculations grow steadily more complicated.""

This suggests that there is a rational basis on which to make such calculations, that the information is getting better, and that the article is presenting us with such information.  But it seems to me that this is not the case.  I don't see how we have good information about this at all.  Given the way areas that seemed to have the virus under control are now seeing more infections, the decision to get a haircut, to have book group meetings, or to meet with one's son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren seem to me largely subjective.  That is what the people described here are choosing, but I don't see what's rational about it or how we know that it's rational.  I am thinking of the article a few days ago by Edgar Sandoval about the families in McAllen, Texas.

It seems to me that if somebody really wants a haircut then they will get a haircut, but I don't see how any good information goes into a calculation about it."
2020-07-17 14:25:03,"Frankly I’m not behaving any differently from when all this began. It seems when people start taking fewer precautions the case numbers increase. I saw an article on what Fauci and other epidemiologists are currently doing — which isn’t a whole lot — and what they are NOT doing, which is more to the point.
Air travel — No! 
Dentist — No! 
Hair cut — maybe if no others in the facility and masks are worn and instruments and chair and so on are cleaned properly. 
Working out inside at the gym — No!
Seeing other people — only outside keeping distance and wearing masks"
2020-07-17 13:58:46,"Being 82 years old, it terrified me to read that ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported, based on March data, that Covid-19 hospitalizations rise with age, from about 12 percent among those 65 to 74 years old to 17 percent for those over 85.""  However, checking the graph provided in the linked CDC report, I found they were talking about hospitalizations per 100k (i.e., per one hundred thousand) rather than percent.  A little k makes a big difference!   Or am I missing something?  Please clarify."
2020-07-17 13:25:49,"I'm 70. I like to shoot. I used to shoot competition. I shoot indoors or used to. The range began with shutting every other booth, enforcing masks and limiting the number of people. That changed. 

I'd like to go but I'm not. My decision in part was based upon my experience working in a Toyota dealership (a few years back) where people would come in dripping sweat from a fever and we were supposed to get up close take their CC and drivers license for documentation. Up to that point I had not had the flu in a few decades. I got it twice. 

Back to the range, two young women in the next booth (supposed to be 2 booths down once upon a time)sneezing and hacking, I was gone. They do test for fever but still the distancing is not being enforced the last time I was there. I could get C19 and croak.

 I've come close to drowning a few times (dumb stuff as a kid). I would not recommend it even though once you're dead you're dead."
2020-07-17 13:46:37,"Like many writing here, I share the co-morbidities. My  tween grandkids are 2 hours away - it might as well be the backside of the moon - except for the ability to Zoom or otherwise videoconference. The grands are in our state's #2 hotspot but the kids' parents and our remaining local child (41) still have to work. We have marshaled our savings and frugal lifestyle to be sure we have the wherewithal to cover *their* daily lives when the inevitable job-income gap arises. 

Yes, we are sacrificing their company (painfully) against the day that recovery can start (Bill Gates' Science Day?). When I want to feel  lucky, more and more I look at video and picture coverage of the ROW, realizing they have to recover as well. Also, my parents were separated for much of the Cold War and our current separation doesn't hold a candle to WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam War, Middle East Wars 1, 2 and 3.  The heartbreaking difference is the poor leadership at the top - but we can change that too!"
2020-07-17 14:30:42,"The Governor of Florida keeps congratulating himself for ""protecting Florida's seniors"".

But what does this mean?

My wife and I have not been able to visit my 92 year old mother-in-law for 5 months. She lives in an apartment in a nice independent living facility, but she and the rest of Florida seniors are effectively ""prisoners"" in their own homes cut off from human interaction with loved ones. With the exception of delivery of meals they are cut off from any human contacts. Such is the life that Governor Desantis has forced upon Florida seniors in their final years because of his reckless ""reopening"" before Florida was ready and before he developed any plan for a safe reopening. 

And for what purpose did Desantis rush the reopening? Not for the benefit of Florida seniors, but more for the perceived political benefit of Donald Trump.

His incompetence is matched only by his callousness and as a result he is killing Floridians as Trump is destroying the United States.

As Florida Covid-19 cases and deaths skyrocket, Desantis refuses to order mandatory mask wearing throughout the state, which at this point should be considered the absolute minimum response.

Florida desperately needs another stay at home order immediately if we are to avert an apocalypse."

My first reaction on seeing the headline was that the article referred to high school or college seniors. In that context, the word means something. Otherwise, it potentially refers to nearly half the population. In discussing a medical risk like COVID-19, more precise language helps."
2020-07-17 14:31:58,"Many of us responding to this op-ed have parents, Uncles, or Aunts who served during WW2 with many giving the ultimate sacrifice. That's just one war I'm mentioning. 
I can hang out with my wife, have groceries delivered and enjoy some nature for a few years if necessary and still not come close to the sacrifice of so many others in this country.
I'll have to say though it does blow my mind that someone would be willing to not wear a mask and die or infect a loved one just to make some stupid political statement for the likes of a con artist like donald.   Politics in this country has become nothing more than a scene from ""The Joker.""   There's not a person on this planet that can logically explain that mindset to me."

Yet, after several months, I am still practicing social distancing, avoiding most real life contact with friends and family until a proven vaccine is available. I see friends for short and distanced walks wearing face coverings, not spending time with them indoors. Aside from these walks we chat on the phone or Zoom. Being patient is more important to me than taking risks with short-term pleasures right now. Sure, it's stressful. But at least I know I will continue to live a healthy life and be able to socialize with my loved ones soon."

2020-07-17 14:40:34,"It is interesting that comments here identify class/wealth issues as fundamental and hierarchical, when the article was about the problematics of choice in an environment where risks are hard to calculate and calibrate - largely because the national government has failed and is deliberately making things worse. There is a continuum of circumstances in which choices are harder and more consequential - particularly for older people who still have to work, who live in multi-generational households, who are vulnerable to thoughtless, selfish behaviour by others. But even those can be exercised within a range that reflects an individual's personal consciousness and desires if they are based on rational assessment of potential outcomes. We all need the best possible information, provided in forms and language that are most useful to us; and governments that will intervene to direct and restrain the population to create conditions in which personal choice is meaningful. conservative writers have repeatedly emphasised for centuries, there is little or no personal freedom where the knowledge of risks is reduced to the point that decisions are chancing on randomness (or you withdraw completely and avoid all choice). The Trump administration has destroyed and continues to destroy the rational basis of social and economic life - whoever you are, no matter how economically comfortable. 

PS The Johnson government here in the UK is a feeble shadow of Trump  - avoid coming here at all cost!"

2020-07-17 13:34:35,"If we had leaders who led and inspired, rather than terrifying us, who helped shape adaptive, science-based behavioral shifts in the populace,, we would not be in this bottomless hole. The entire country needs to pitch in together, not divided. Instead, we get young people whining that they can't attend big drunken parties, a legion of  people writing ""risk checks"" on other people's lives, and older people complaining that they can't vacation. Few refer to altruistic models of behavior like WWII (albeit imperfect).  To understand what each cohort must do takes some understanding of viruses and immunity, an understanding of shifting demographics, and the reality principle--i.e. science. We need a cheerleader in America for facing reality. What has been encouraging is that many Americans are finding their way creatively, and being neighborly. 
Some suggestions: Grocers offering drive-by, continue this until the end of this state of siege. People who are sharing their resources, keep it up. This is a duration. It won't be over for you until it's over for all of us.
We can sweep out the false leaders, all of them, if we are realistic. Those in power now might obscure the statistics and try to steal our enfranchisement--but we all can scream our heads off, can push to vote safely, and throw the bastards out. And after that we will all have a lot of real work to do, sharing, and healing as a country. I can't wait for the contagion of lies to end, so we can tackle the virus head on."

I have been in lockdown since March. You can count the number of times I have been to a store since March on one hand. My doctor tells me that I shouldn’t leave the house for any reason. 

The only time I have been really sick was when I was 19 and had viral pericarditis (an inflammation of the sack the heart sits in). I was hospitalized for three weeks. Since it was caused by a virus, they could do nothing. Once in the middle of the night I felt so awful I thought I was dying. I saw a bright light in the upper corner of the room. I fought back and lived at 19, but don’t know if I can at 71. 

The good news is that I never get colds or the flu. My doctors have said that this is because I don’t touch my face. However, I can’t rely on this to protect me. 

The problem is that people need to be around and socialize with other people. Zooming is not enough. If I have to continue this for another 18 months I will be a basket case."

We are fortunate beyond belief. So if we survive this healthy then some day travel can resume (I hope)

With schools in Georgia still scheduled  to open in August we are planning to hunker down away from our grandkids again. I know there are plenty of people effected in awful ways but this is so painful to us to think about. We had a 6 week quarantine from them in April when I still worked as a nurse in a major hospital and were protecting them from me. Now it looks like the opposite needs to happen to protect us from them.  Out governor refuses to follow the science and mandate mask wearing.

It doesn't have much of a ring to it, like the ""Roaring Twenties"" of the last century, but we live in the Age of Fecklessness.

For more than 20 years, I have gone to St John in the USVI. Last October, as I do every year, I booked flights (first class) and a condo for August 5th. Well if the plane flies and St John stays open, I am going. Next year I could be in a wheel chair with no chance of going.

Celebrating our grandson's job with the car we promised a year ago. Now we spend our days dusting a house no one will ever see. Repairing steps and railings, cleaning out the garage. Watching way too much television, knitting up all the yarn stashed away. The most we can do for the political campaigns we were once so active in is to make phone calls and write letters. Our stimulus check is given to the local Neighborhood Missions to help families who need it more. But we can not go to help distribute food and aid.
Being 80 and with health problems is the pits...but I look at my widowed friend who opted for living in a sr. residence who has not been allowed out of her apartment since March, meals are delivered and contact with others is by phone only. If that does not bring depression and senility I do not know what does. At least we have our yard, our dogs, some gardening....but no one to sit on our deck and share a drink or meal. 
Fortunately our zip code has not experienced a single case..., but it is summer and the National Forest with it's campgrounds and tourism surround us.

The only risk I take is going into stores to buy food. To order online   turned out to be stressful,and food cost at least 25 % more. And all the pleasure of buying food was gone.
Now I plan for the second wave that might come in the autumn ,I store more food and try to adjust emotionally to our new life. The hard part is to learn to live with daily danger.In this country we are used to feeling safe all the time and suddenly danger is there non stop for us in the high risk groups. The strange thing is that I have never felt any fear or anxiety . Never and that surprises me. What I feel is a strong will to stay healthy and safe and part of that is to read up and learn as much as I can about the corona virus .
Calculated risk ? Only shopping food and noting else.

I do not suffer but understand that maybe I have to live like this for the rest of my life."

We see our son and his family, who are also isolating, at outdoor, safely distanced dinners in our backyard once a week.  Five years ago I completed chemo for a cancer that few survive more than two years.  I am not going to get Covid after going through five grueling months of chemo, 8 hours a day, four days a week!  It’s just not worth it to me to take the chance.  Thankfully I gave myself the gift of a pool after completing chemo, so I can swim safely daily."

2020-07-17 14:53:24,"These decisions aren't difficult to make if you care about other people. If they go to the party the risks of someone getting sick is high because family will be flying .I think 40% of spreaders are asymptomatic even in the nursing homes or also the over  65 group. Planes and bars are some of the most contagious environment.
Perhaps  he doesn't care about dying now though even though  Covid is a horrible painful devastating illness.This disease  may  leave permanent organ damage in half the people who go to the hospital.How will he feel if she dies or any member of his family gets sick or spreads it when they go back home.
The selfish part of this story is not considering the guilt family members will feel when anyone of them falls ill. .
This choice is simple and as they risk spreading the disease  not only to the  the family but to all the other people  these partiers  will encounter after this event. The family needs to decide do they want this burden and hey 40 yr old may suffer  permanent  organ damage also, Dad!

As for me, I am trying to choose risk carefully, seeing friends and adult children while taking reasonable precautions like masks and distance. Luckily people in my community are generally careful."

2020-07-17 15:36:58,"Each person has their own perspective, their own life experience that affects how they calculate risks and benefits. 

Speaking for myself, I lost my father to cancer when I was 22 and my son to suicide when he was 26.  My wife has had cancer twice (three times if you count a melanoma) and I've survived prostate cancer.  

After all of this, our daughter fell and had severe injuries to her brain, face, teeth and more.  Luckily, 3+ years later, she is almost fully recovered.

Looking back on all these events, we feel that we have already endured the worst losses we are ever likely to suffer.  We feel that life is both precious and fragile, and that we don't only live for ourselves but for others too--family, friends, community.

We are economically secure, have jobs we can do from home, have all our necessities delivered, and recognize that our ability to stay home 24/7 is a luxury.  We have eliminated all non-essential forays outdoors, except for the few times we took a short walk with our dog.  

Our daughter is the only person we have allowed inside our apartment.  Since her brother died, she has been an only child.  On her behalf and also on behalf of each other we feel it would be irresponsible for us to risk our health by exposing ourself to avoidable risks.

That is just the perspective of two people.  Others have different experiences and points of view, and will draw their own conclusions."
2020-07-17 15:38:20,"I have to evaluate each thing I do these days.  I choose to live and not going out is difficult, but something I have to look at carefully.

The politicization of the virus and of mask wearing has made a bad situation far worse than it needed to be.  If you're a senior and have underlying medical problems, as most of us do, you have to take this as seriously as a heart attack.  Not a pleasant analogy, but a necessary one.

Not enough is being written about what this is doing to seniors and we aren't receiving the aid we should be receiving.  For the most part, we're being sacrificed, just like the poor and immigrants.

How horrendous this will ultimately end up being is an unknown now, but for we seniors, it's already horrendous."

I don’t need to calculate anything. Don’t go out unless absolutely necessary. Wear a mask when out. Strictly avoid places where people are not wearing masks or not practicing so-called “social distancing.”

Get an iPad and learn to use it, including using FaceTime, Skype, and Zoom.

We realistically expect to shelter in place for another 12-18 months, until we can get vaccinated AND enough people are vaccinated--and the vaccine offers effective protection for more than 8 weeks--to create herd immunity. We feel we can shop for food--nearby Nashua requires face masks--and eat out using restaurants with outdoor seating.  

We each have health issues which make us particularly vulnerable.  So living in a single family detached dwelling in a town with 2-acre zoning (we all have wells and septic tanks) gives us enough flexibility to be comfortable. Sure, we'd like to feel free to do more, to hug children and grandchildren, to travel, to eat out more... Be what we have now is much better than dying alone in a hospital gasping for breath. 

We are thankful we are not in nursing homes or assisted living situations, which appear ti be convenient clusters of potential Covid-19 victims waiting to be infected."

In the hospital, we (for now) have the PPE we need, I wash or sanitize my hands multiple times an hour, and staff are generally scrupulous about taking necessary precautions in all patient interactions.

In the outside world, on the other hand, people of all ages think it's a badge of honor not to wear a mask, that they're not going to be infected by the virus, and that the imposition of mandates is somehow Communism. This is so very misguided.

Public health can frequently clash with the rights of the individual (think of mandatory quarantine of active TB patients) in order to protect the health of all individuals. This is what is happening here and now. 

The collective health of all people requires that we all alter our ""normal"" for the good of society. Older folks like myself, middle-aged and younger adults, teenagers and younger children all need to adapt to the new normal. Some may need help in adapting, but that's what society as a whole is supposed to do--help individuals who need it.

It's high time we worked for the collective good, understanding that the rights of the individual will mean nothing if the individual is dead."

Now? I isolate. Just this month I started doing take-outs. That helped. I haven't seen family since this all started. I do miss them. A lot.

In 1987, the year I was born—the corporatocracy was already strong. My mother knew the medical system was broken then and as a healthy, strong, young woman knew it would be safer to have me at home (with a husband and wife OBGYN/certified nurse midwife team) than in the filthy for-profit hospitals. None of the mess was hidden but you all decided not to look, it would have been uncomfortable. I have no problem making *minor* concessions for the sake of all IF the leaders and country are working toward changing all of the systems that lead us to this mess. If I hear another older person talk about how they want things back to *normal* I will lose it. Everything was broken before Covid.  The level of comfort was never sustainable. Covid is but a symptom of a fatally ill society. We’re all going to die—are you willing to forgo all your freedoms and sacrifice the youth and the impoverished (more than you already have) for your own safety? So that you can take pharmaceuticals to live to 100? I’m disgusted with the elders in this country. Little lost sheep. Spending quarantine dusting your McMansion?

2020-07-17 15:52:37,"The elephant in the room in these discussions is that any risk one takes, one takes on behalf of other people as well. There is no simple calculus that can assure us that any particular activity is safe - if we're thinking of others' safety as well as our own.

Anything you decide to do, you might conclude the risk is worth it to YOU, but are you certain of who else you might encounter while doing it? And you will often have no way of gauging what risks the other person you encounter may face.

The answer isn't stay inside forever, obviously. But our entire society has trouble with the notion of considering COMMUNAL risks at the same time as gauging personal risks.

The couple in the article considering a trip to London in September .. . I feel for them, since that trip seems unlikely now ... but then we have to consider, they want London, but does London want THEM? There's a reason Europe has told Americans to stay home. The decision about the trip to London - even if the travel restrictions get lifted by then - is about more than whether they will be safe in London.

They may feel like, well, we're getting old, we deserve to have some fun! Sure. But the couple will also come into contact with older folks, or folks with other risk factors, while in London who didn't have any say while the couple planned their vacation. Wait staff in hotels, restaurants, flight attendants, etc. They will be making this decision on their behalf as well as their own."

As someone else said -- it was easy when the same rules applied to everyone.  My husband's mother lives with us -- so although my husband and I are in our 50s, we continue to limit ourselves pretty much as we did when NJ was on strict lockdown.

This is causing issues with my mother and siblings, who think I'm being ""dramatic"" by not attending the non-distanced family functions they've started to have.  But since my mother, siblings and their kids have pretty much all gone back to work and/or ""normal"" activities -- meaning their risk of exposure is going up, even in a state where cases are currently staying steady -- how can I justify the risk to my MIL?

I'm lucky that I work in a white collar job that can be done from home, and that my employer has maintained its remote work practices.  It just seems foolhardy to me to take risks that I don't have to take just to say that I've gone out"

2020-07-17 17:52:48,"The statement that ""age alone"" carries increased risk is inaccurate and dangerous. Studies showing that older people are more likely to die (or get severe cases) do not account for other factors, such as comorbidities or living in nursing homes. 

Many people over 65 do not take medications and live active, independent lives. Locking them up will actually compromise their healthy immune systems, lower their self-efficacy perceptions, and drastically lower their quality of life.

The WSJ reported on June 20 that the age relationship does not seem to hold in high-poverty countries; in Mexico, the virus is just as severe for people in their 40s because many have diabetes and high blood pressure. Mexico does not put older people in nursing homes. 

The NYT itself has noted that 42% of *all* Covid19 deaths nationwide are associated with nursing  homes. When you take away those deaths, what's left?

2020-07-17 18:53:16,"So far, there seem to be some best practices for seniors traveling. I'm 66.

Don't use planes, trains, buses, or ships. Your own car is OK.

Eat food from drive-through fast food windows. After you get your food, use hand sanitizer. If you want to sit while you eat, either eat in your car in the parking lot, or drive out to someplace natural nearby where you are alone. A sandwich by a rushing stream with birds singing in a farm field can be delightful.

Don't worry too much about gas stations, other than wearing your mask because you may be near other people gassing up. Worry more about going inside to the rest room or for a snack or soda. Use hand sanitizer when you're done and back in your car.

Hotels and motels are mostly OK; the check-in clerk is a much larger concern than anything in your room. If they aren't wearing a mask, don't even go in the lobby. Worry more about staying with friends or relatives. A motel would be safer.

Bring your own pen and use it to sign all credit card receipts.

Don't go where everyone else is going. Avoid the most popular national parks, such as Rocky Mountain, Grand Canyon, Great Smokies. Don't go on any group tours at an attraction.

This is not the summer to visit museums. Outdoor historic areas such as Gettysburg are ok, but don't go in the visitor center.

Enjoy the countryside! Get off the Interstate (and away from dangerous crowds) and travel the two-lane state highways."

Hence I'm continuing to venture out only for groceries and pharmacy.  I have to have blood work next week but my doctor's office has set up a kind of ""tunnel"" from entering the building directly to their lab and I'm going to use that while wearing gloves and a mask.

People seem to be frustrated and impatient with all these limitations and restrictions but my parents lived into their 80s and 90s and I don't want to sacrifice possibly another 2 decades of life because I'm bored, frustrated and annoyed by the current situation.  I'm all those things - but consider the possible payoff if I continue to be careful."

Labeling mask resisters as unpatriotic would then be a very effective means of gaining almost universal compliance, which is what has occurred in many European countries. But that requires leadership. 

If you look at the countries with the worst Covid-19 problems, USA, Brazil, Russia, Spain, the UK, Italy and France, the “leaders” are all men.

What has surprised us is how many people in this country are unable to sit still - even when their lives are at risk. I recognize that some people's home environment is not conducive to extended quarantine, but even people who live in great comfort who seem unable to stay in a beautiful environment of their our making.

It is not just young people who won't stay home. My 88 year old mother is downright cavalier about her chances of contracting covid, and claims she is immune from getting it!  I have  accepted that I will not change her mind.

What I cannot accept is that this president is lying to the American people and actually encouraging them to ""return to normal."". It is sheer lunacy, but after reading Mary Trump's book, I understand Trump is so hollow inside that he needs a crowd like most of us need air. 

This hollow man is leading some of our most vulnerable population to their own demise. There are many, many ways we could be encouraging people to quarantine for their own protection. Instead, we are told that we older people must ""sacrifice"" ourselves to reopen. My response is, ""You first."""
2020-07-17 20:32:17,"Two thoughts. It should be made explicit that the numbers for hospitalizations per 100,000 (12 for 65 to 74 years old and 17 for over 85) are for everyone in those age groups, not just for those who test positive for the virus. And I don't think these are very useful number to help make the decision as to whether you should go out. The numbers to consider  are the current prevalence of the disease in your area, to get an idea of the chances that you will get the virus if you go out,  and the mortality rate for those who test positive in your age/vulnerability group, to get an idea of how serious your case would be.  

In my state, among those who test positive and are over 80, the death (not hospitalization) rate is about 1/3, a shocking number. For good statistics for Massashusetts, partitioned by age,  see the state's COVID dashboard at:

My second thought is that the MIT economist's idea that the old should stay in isolation while we should open up for the young sounds good at first, but it actually carries big risks, as of course there are many connections between old and young - many young people living with parents and grandparents (especially now), and younger people serving as carers for older people. Also, there are risks for the young, and this strategy may be playing out in Florida now and many ICUs are at capacity. Economists, stick to interest rates!"
2020-07-17 20:33:52,"I'm in my 70's. No comorbidities or medications. Calculator shows a 3.1% chance of catching Covid. That's nice.

Reality however, begs to differ. I had a 'mild' case back in early March, which I'm sure I picked up at my local Y while weight lifting. 

This is one mean, nasty virus that tests every one of your systems looking for vulnerabiliies. Took 2 weeks to totally shake, and another week to fully recover. 

My advice? By all means do what you can to limit exposure. But far, FAR more importantly - get healthy. Especially metabolically healthy. 

Stop eating *added* sugars of any kind, or hyper-processed or fast food. Learn to cook - really cook - all your food from scratch. Yup, bagels and pizza too. Do Intermittent Fasting by picking an 8 hour window and eating only in that time: one or two meals a day. NO COUNTING CALORIES. Eat good food until you're full, not stuffed. No food group left out. Tip: added sugar is not a food.

If you don't have barbells, order some. Squats, planks, pushups daily. By the tome there's a vaccine, you'll be in the best shape (literally) you've seen in decades. You might still get Covid, but you will have vastly increased your chance of getting a mild case."
2020-07-17 20:49:22,"We live in a rural area on two acres so mostly eat at home anyway and we stay very busy with yard projects so we are outdoors a lot without ever being in contact with other people.  So the virus really has not had much effect on our everyday lives but it has put a big dent in our travel plans. We decided the risk of planes, airports, hotels, and constantly eating in restaurants is way too high for our liking and so we are staying put until the risk is much much lower; basically for us that means waiting for the day that face masks are no longer needed.

Please correct me if I am wrong. I am generally all in for isolation if possible, and curtailing any event that is not necessary. Also, for a couple each one should have veto power on anything that is the least bit risky. 
  But these numbers are way lower than I would have imagined.  THey seem low for the population at large and when they are for the most vulnerable among us, even lower."
2020-07-17 21:10:44,"Good decision on Lake Placid. Several weeks ago we gave up our 2 weeks in Nova Scotia in August because we didn't feel safe. Now Canada has decided to keep the border closed so we couldn't get in anyway! 

And you can forget about the UK in September. By then it will be much worse in the U.S. than it is now, and no country with any sense will let us cross its border. Besides, theaters are closed everywhere. If you want London theater, watch National Theatre productions on YouTube - terrific!"

2020-07-17 20:55:43,"I am reading biography of Dr Benj Rush, and his experience during the Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia in 1792 has many echos of our current situation.  
Exactly how the disease was transmitted was uncertain and much debated by the public and by the physician 'experts'.  Most people had the sense that physical proximity to infected persons was risky, so they would cross the street to avoid houses with sick people inside, avoid shaking hands, etc (but no masks).  Nobody wanted to touch the body of  somebody who had  died of the Fever - so African-Americans (freed former slaves) were hired to cart the dead to cemeteries. It was at first thought that Blacks were immune to the disease - based on the false analogy to malaria.  Then these Blacks were accused of stealing from the dead and looting their homes !  Most were unpaid and did this work for altruistic reasons.  These African-Americans also helped Dr Rush in caring for patients (and bleeding them as the main rx), because hardly any other doctors remained the city, having fled to the 'safer' countryside.
Yellow Fever also became politicized: Federalists and Republicans favored different treatments and approaches to containment, and  followed different ""experts"" accusing the other side  of various things, including favoring ""foreign"" (i.e. French) remedies.  Alexander Hamilton was said to have caught the Fever  because he had a inordinately high level of fear.
In the end, the epidemic went away after the first hard frost"

My husband and I are in this position, though both in our 70s, and we’re finding it very hard to figure out what may be safe - or maybe safe enough.  The main decision is whether (and how) to spend time with the local family : my grandchildren (ages 3 and 8) and their parents.  It’s comforting to see that apparently we are not more likely to catch COVID on account of age, but only more likely to get very sick (and possibly die or have long term ill health problems).  My husband happens to have type O blood, as well, which apparently may give him a bit more protection.  Mine is B which apparently is sort of a neutral risk factor, with A type possibly putting people at higher risk."

My mom was an extrovert, by dad was an introvert, and I'm an ambivert: somewhere in-between the 2, so I'm just  as happy watching TV and reading indoors, as I am being outdoors. Like the man in the article felt (according to his wife,) if you're always going to look over your shoulder when you're out and about, like in a restaurant, some of the enjoyment would be gone. Hubby and I would rather stay here, (even with my so-so cooking), than be in an indoor restaurant where some people may inadvertently come closer than 6 feet to you.

It’s one thing to live alone quite another to be locked in with no social contact. FaceTime and Zoom didn’t cut it. One daughter decided on a driveway visit. That helped but also made me realize how I longed to interact with people again. 
I resumed food shopping with care. I started long walks. The silence was eerie. I was a medical professional so I get the recommendations for the elderly but they don’t take into consideration that we only have one day at a time left. While I’m healthy and vibrant, I don’t want to live like a recluse.

Our daughters grocery shop for us, we all wear masks but haven't been within 10 feet of them. Since February, no one has come inside our house. Trips have been canceled and gatherings postponed until it'll clearly be safe to do so. Despite ""wanting"" to do many things socially, the risk/reward of doing so makes no sense. We're no longer the careless ""heroes"" of youth and have exchanged that for the wisdom one can get from living longer.  With the misguided willingness of some risking the health of others in our community, we're much better off erring on the side of safety. The inconvenience, given the alternative, is something, hopefully, that will enable us to live much longer."

I'd rather take my chances with this virus than live in a country that takes away my freedom because it's too incapable of doing what other developed nations have been capable of doing. The damage to those of us who have been fighting the stereotyping and negativity directed at older Americans in this country may be one of the most detrimental unintended consequences adding to an already totally horrible stereotype of older Americans as almost useless and subject to any and every infirmity and disability that is known to man the second they hit that magic milestone- 65.

My time is taken up by exercise, sleep, trading stocks and options and my news junky life. She reads lots of novels, The Wall Street Journal and fun family and friends' emails and text messages. And she talks on the phone.

Like 30-year-olds, we search the Internet for a new home with a pool for her and good nearby health care for both of us. We've been doing this for years.

Feeling strong and kinda immortal at our age seems strange and unreal. Our brains still feel like they did 50 years ago, but our bodies are showing our ages.

We just wish more people would wear masks in public, exercise, stay at home and physically distance. But even our older friends often seem to forget themselves when they get together.

We've known from the beginning that we have to look out for ourselves, because there are plenty of people who don't worry about who they might infect and kill.

That's about all virus vulnerable people can do. Be careful and alert to risks, and don't get too angry, because it won't do anybody much good."

So, aside from the ennui of self-isolation for five months, I am accepting whatever groceries the ""shopper"" brings me despite my online list; cutting my own hair; doing my own nails; and cleaning my own house.

This is logical based on the discussion of the viruses structure and vulnerabilities. -It has been mentioned that the integrity of the viral outer coat increases the infectious capacity of the virus. Soap and water destabilizes the lipid outer coat, the increased energy in heat or sunlight also destabilizes the outer coat.- The viral outer envelope is, by contrast strengthened when exposed to cooler temperatures in the 50's F range. The air conditioning coils chill surrounding air to the 40's and 50's F - then send it out into the room air. So, the viral envelope is stabilized and reinforced by circulating through the air conditioning system. Any coronavirus present in the room air, which is recirculated through the 50's F, air conditioning would be more virulent. Coronavirus recirculated through a heating system would by contrast, be weakened or killed before entering the room area. Air exchange systems which do not recirculate room air, but rather bring in exterior air would avoid this."

We got there, and they immediately threw all that out the window. They had set the table indoors because it was “too hot” outdoors (it wasn’t). We insisted on eating outdoors anyway. They were hurt by our wearing masks with them, and we caved (never mind that I was hurt that they wouldn’t wear masks for us). They kept breaching the six feet distance. They actually hugged my husband. Eventually they got my husband to come into their air-conditioned house, where he sat with them for over an hour, unmasked. I stayed outside, which I know they saw as rude behavior. It was awful, and I can finally breathe easily today as it has finally been 14 days since then.

I will not be returning until this is over, and my husband is faced with three difficult choices: don’t see his parents (possibly ever) again, see them while offending them, or see them on their terms and risk compromising their and our health.

I am looking forward with eagerness though I am in my 70’s, helping my spouse get through more chemo, missing the grandkids like crazy, doing all the driving,  grocery-shopping, cooking and housework myself (as per usual) , etc. Meanwhile, being very smart and careful.

2020-07-19 12:02:58,"My husband and I are older and feel vulnerable given the federal government's abject failure to protect Americans. To this day there's not enough PPE. What will happen as cases keep going up? When the flu arrives? Will governors and hospital admins still have to make midnight runs in unmarked trucks to get the supplies they've ordered and paid for, or will the feds pirate them? No way we want to chance ending up in the hospital.

We are as strict now as we've been since March except we're not being maniacal about disinfecting the groceries. We still leave the mail outside to bake in the sun, and we don't go anywhere. Our son lives nearby but is so afraid of getting us sick, we spend our time together out in the yard, 6-ft apart, wearing masks."

Oh no no no. If you are at high risk from covid-19, then please do not leave your house. If you think the children should stay home from school next fall, then you should also help contain the pandemic by not leaving your house. If you think it’s too risky for children to return to school (with masks and social distance), then your activities (with masks and social distance) are too risky too"

I thought it would give more concrete advice outside of a) don't get old b) don't be an American and c) a link to a calculator.  So how do you calculate the risk of Coronavirus? Just like with our failed leadership, we are all left on our own to figure that path and just hope it isn't the wrong one."
2020-07-19 13:54:33,"Risks, risks, risks. Everyday I calculate my risks. At first, I was sheltered at home, my daughter and grandkids were very good about picking up anything I needed. But after 4 weeks...I’ve gone to the grocery myself, picking a time and a store location where the traffic was less. I gauge the parking lot, if it’s full, I just keep going. 

Been to the doctors and dentist, but still haven’t gotten my hair cut or a pedicure. 

Taking French lessons thru zoom at the library. And I’ve been to the library twice, where some of the strictest distancing rules are in place. Return books are quarantined for 72 hours, reserved books are put on the scanner to check out, all you have to do is scan your card. And only one person in at a time. 

I’ve given up my volunteer job at the local farmers market, I think I miss that most of all. I’m considering going back, very early and helping before the market opens now that we have a mandated mask order by the governor. 

We have a long planned family vacation on the Outer Banks that everyone is keeping their fingers crossed for. We’ve all agreed to quarantine ourselves before we go because there is me, the grandparent, and one family member who has an compromised immune issue. If we can get tested, we will. But it’s hard to find a test here in NC, unless you’ve been exposed. 

Mentally, it’s been getting harder and more frustrating. I find solace in my small garden where at least I can see the bugs I’m battling."
2020-07-19 13:54:33,"An unspoken aspect of this conversation is the assumption this situation will continue into an unknown, limitless time frame. Look at Europe, New Zealand, South Korea, Ben China. If we could all (or a huge majority even) act in a way to drive the infections down, we would be ""out of jail."" With the rate as high as it is, I don't know if it's three weeks of wearing masks and social distancing or 5 weeks, but it doesn't have to be an indefinite time frame. 

There is no magic to reducing infection rates. I'm not for shaming people into wearing masks. I take my daily walk and pass a very few people without masks, and they and I widen the distance between us just as those who are approaching with masks do. I greet them either way with my (hidden) smile, a wave or a ""hello."" 

One way to keep personal help afloat economically if your income continues is to send money to those who have provided personal services during the break of their service -- people who clean your home, cut your hair, do your nails, provide training or massages, etc. and buying take out from a favorite restaurant. 

Fear can be useful to guide healthy practices, but it shouldn't keep us from doing the right thing, whether that pertains to health or the economy."
2020-07-19 14:06:32,"The real point is a significant proportion of the population is alive today due to artificial interventions.  Meaning medical procedures, which are man made and therefore artificial, such as surgery and pharma is what's keeping them alive.  environmental as well, like air conditioning.

Those interventions function with in a very narrow set of parameters to be successful.  Change something and the outcomes change.  That's all we're seeing."
2020-07-19 14:07:12,"I went to the COVID calculator. Unless I'm misunderstanding it, it's no help at all. It seems to predict who will get the virus based upon who has tested positive for virus in a large sample (correlational study). But most of the variables they ask about, like age and pre-existing medical conditions, predict who will get a more severe case, not who is more likely to become infected. My understanding is that the only variable that really matters in that regard is: have you been in contact with somebody who has the virus? That's there, but why are all the other variables there? For example, race is included. That seems to make sense since e.g. Blacks are more likely to become infected than whites. But that's because of moderator variables like income and type of employment (which may put Blacks in more contact with people, some of whom may be infectious). So once again, it's not race that predisposes somebody to become infected -- it's how race influences contact with those who may be infected. And if you are Black but staying at home, then the race question is irrelevant or misleading. So -- what is the point of the survey? (Correlation does not imply causation)"
2020-07-19 14:10:11,"I went into a non-grocery store for the second time the other day. Very exciting! My husband and I would like to go for a drive today, but I'm calculating. . . will the outdoor places we might go to be crowded? We won't eat at a restaurant, so what happens if we need to use a bathroom? It's tourist/summer home visitor time here. So. we'll probably keep our drive very local.

Given the range of life's possible horrors, however, this is quite manageable. We're pretty healthy. We have food, and plenty of it. Our home is intact, not ravaged by floods, tornadoes, fire, or bombs. Our children all live far away, so it's nothing new not to see them for long stretches of time, and usually there's one who's put out with us anyway.  I have a job that permits me to work remotely.  If we stay alive, there's a good chance we'll get to take the vacation we missed, go to a concert, get together with friends. That puts us in the category of the elite compared to much - no, most - of the world. So we don't get whiny very often. 

The only thing that makes my blood boil is that ineffectual - no, BAD - leadership in the White House and an absence of coordinated public education at the federal level about preventing the spread have made this a circus of difficulties for people in life or death situations.  And we are lucky to have Governor Mills in office rather than her bombastic predecessor. Can't imagine what a hash he would have made of this."
2020-07-19 14:42:08,"With all the extra risk factors for seniors, why are some states, like California, still insisting you show up in person at the DMV office,  stand in a line (even with an “appointment”)  to get your drivers license renewed?

2020-07-19 14:52:53,"Too many friends and family members make proximity and activities a matter of trust and not science. We’re fortunate to have a group of friends as careful as we are so, for at least the summer, we get some in person, outdoors socializing. We hear stories of people taking distancing and other precautions as a personal attack, “you don’t trust me”. Weariness and fear is understandable, disregard for other people’s concerns and precautions is not. Under the circumstances, if you can’t be satisfied with seeing/communicating with a close one with some restrictions, you’re the one in need of readjustment. The next many months need to be about patience and resilience."

2020-07-19 15:09:43,"I tried the riskcalc.org/COVID19/ link using a chromebook and a windows 10 laptop and kept getting the 502 Bad Gateway message so I tried riskcalc.org alone and got into the Clevland Clinic Risk Calculator Library. Clicking the SELECT A CONDITION drop down menu brings up several conditions including COVID19. It's not user friendly enough for this 65% centenarian with no medical background, but I already know that my age and physical condition, infection could result in death or serious injury. 

So should I go to my favorite AA meeting with roughly 25 people sitting 3 feet apart in an air conditioned room, some wearing masks, some not, with people now shaking hands, talking with their masks pulled down.....or should I stick with the zoom version? Here's my thought process:

According to Georgia Tech exposure risk calculator <a href=""https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu"" target=""_blank"">https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu</a>/ in McHenry county, IL, there's an approximately 25% chance of at least one person in a communicable state of infection attending that meeting. No warm fuzzy there.

Masks are mandated by the club rules but there's no enforcement. If I do go I'd only feel safe wearing an N95 mask and use a hand sanitizer making me really look out of place.

Where do I sit? Between mask wearers is preferable but I can't control that.

Any comments about my dilemma?"
2020-07-19 15:43:37,"At age 80 with assorted medical preconditions (I have survived three heart attacks), I--and my wife--have reduced our world to the confines of our property: 5/8 of an acre.  We expect this siuation to continue well into 2021.  We had to have a service tech come on the property (with full PPE) to change the modem (we can't live without the Net), but that's it.   We'll talk with family on the phone.  And our cross-Canada train trip has now been moved (again) to 2021.   

There are some plusses.  Our gasoline bill has all but disappeared. The yard's getting long-overdue attention.  We're starting to clean out stuff that's needed to go.  We've rediscovered jigsaw puzzles.  Thanks to Magnificat, I've learned to say Mass at home.  The world has not changed: the old world---the way it once was--is gone.

This year the Chinese Flu has caused that figure to double.  Because there was no flu shot to damp down the figure.

The risk of this thing has been outrageously overstated.

If you want to be afraid of it, more power to you.  But anyone under 40 has nothing to fear.

Only health issue is I have hypertension but it is fully under control with medication. Regularly exercise and we have been very careful although have not restricted ourselves as much as the couple from MD (we go to the grocery store and home improvement stores, both of us go to our places of work but very few others are there and we are able to stay way far away from the others, wear masks in public, frequent hand washings and use of sanitizer).

We are also scheduled to go to Yellowstone in early fall. Bucket list item planned for over a year. Have cancellation insurance but really do not want to do that.

I tend to lean Republican but I cannot understand the sheer stupidity of people not being willing to wear masks. It is even more boggling that anyone with an ounce of common sense would ever think that this is a personal freedom issue (but we are frequently seeing how common sense is not included in the Venn diagram circle for many people.

It broke my heart but I recently withdrew from a long planned role as the officiant at a dear friend's daughter's wedding in spite of their thoughtful plans for distancing, masks, etc.  As the officiant, distancing from wedding guests would be difficult and disheartening for all.  And I couldn't, in good faith, participate in planning the ceremony when I had one hand on the mental rip cord if local conditions worsened.   My decision was sealed by the fact that we and a small group of friends have developed protocols for meeting; outside, distanced, careful.  We cherish those meetings.  I knew that my participation would concern members of that small group, some of whom have medical conditions. It would make them uncomfortable and concerned about my exposure.

But for years I've been told by doctors that I am a potentially hazardous ""asymptomatic carrier"" of contagions. That haunts me,  so I stick to the rules.

Having no fear of infection, my personal reaction to the pandemic is a growing grief for its impact on the people, the nation I love and the way it has exposed and exacerbated the malignant dysfunctions in our culture and its government. It's as if a shadow has fallen upon the land to block out the truths and the values we once pursued with hope and confidence. 

I thought I saw hope in a video; there was a little girl marching with  an ethnically mixed group, peacefully pleading for justice. But then I had a PTSD flashback from an older film where the little girl wore a red coat.

I realize I am fortunate to even have the choice to socially isolate or risk having a small careful family group and extremely limited and occasional masked visits to a store.

2020-07-19 19:44:54,"As older people, my wife and I started social distancing and ""lockdown"" before any state or local stay-at-home orders were put into place, and we haven't changed our behavior much when the lockdown orders were eased nor when they were reapplied.  The only major change came when the government flip-flopped on mask use.  I avidly read the media for new developments, but in reality little has changed over the the past few months concerning risk factors or behavioral guidance, and so we're unlikely to start doing anything different.  At this point a vaccine is nothing but a mirage, and if something comes along that is only 50% effective (the FDA criterion for adequate efficacy) we're unlikely to change our behavior, although I have no hesitation getting vaccinated assuming no major side effects."

2020-07-19 20:34:24,"Excellent article. We are 66, retired, we have limited our socializing to our immediate family. Our adult  and their families have quarantined and have down their best to adhere to wearing masks in public and social distancing. We are 15, but get together outdoors where we can social distance, until the weather changes and then we will meet in small groups with windows opened and masks on. Even going camping we wear masks and social distance, a small inconvenience so we can see each other, once in a while...we’ve met twice now, in five months and our county has flattened the curve nicely, thanks to everyone cooperating!

As a data management/designer/specialist I can state with authority that this article is exceptionally flawed. 

What has arisen since the beginning of June 2020, in the United States, which reports on the facts and particulars of Covid-19 infections, and the increase in cases and deaths in my state of California, are qualitative facts, that it is the youth, as young as 18 who are acquiring the disease and dying.  

A disproportionate number of young individuals, who clearly thought they are immune and made of steel, acquired the infection while grouping ""outdoors"" not indoors, in the state of California. 

This article is false, and subjects like so many of the ill informed articles of the New York Times, the actual qualitative data of the new Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths. 

Reference California's Covid-19 datum.  The number of new deaths are in the zone of persons older or equal to age 18, but not more than 49 years of age.

You're probably not going to become infected if you stay away from other people, keep you hands off your face, and keep them and your face clean.  Of course, I'm not a Dr. or a scientist, so I'm pretty sure I don't know what I'm talking about.  No matter what is used to calculate your odds of being infected, if you're negligent and practice risky behavior, it only takes a little virus getting on one of your mucus membranes and you're fried.  Just stay away from other people.  If you want to go outside, wear a mask.  And, as far as the haircut goes, go online, order a barber clipper for 20 bucks and give yourself a buzz cut.  Takes about 10 mins. and you'll look great.  You can even select from numerous lengths.  I use 3mm."

My sister and brother-in-law have regretfully given up seeing their grandchildren for a week, because the Oregon resort where they planned to stay seems to be doing not much about protecting its guests. They are heartbroken, but it's better than possibly being dead.

My brother and sister-in-law plan to gather their large clan as ever at their vacation home in the high Sierra. 

My brother will be sad but not heartbroken to hear that both I and his sister (the one who will miss her grandchildren in Oregon) won't be seeing him until two weeks after he returns infection-free from the high Sierra.

We are anxious about staying in South Florida during hurricane season. But any travel mode we consider is just too risky for us now. Mostly, we worry about encountering mundane medical problems away from home. A sprained ankle, a car accident, or a dizzy spell could expose us to the chaos of an unknown hospital system at best; and at worst, COVID-19. So we’re staying home, enjoying early morning and evening outdoor activities and hoping for the world to get better. We miss our families and friends who are spread across 4 continents, but no one thinks getting together is a good idea now."

She has been living her life the last few months as if there’s no pandemic—seeing lots of friends, going to small parties, etc. I’ve asked her whether she was worried about getting COVID, and she said she was willing to take her chances.

The other day she texted me in a panic: “I had a terrible cough today! My worst nightmare is getting COVID!”

I said, “But I thought you weren’t worried about getting it? 

She said, “Of course I’m worried about getting it!”

Luckily, the cough disappeared, and she felt fine the next day.

You are the at risk group. You could die if you catch it

If you are the opposite of this profile you are good to go
Wear a mask

Just don’t live with someone in the high risk group

2020-07-20 02:25:18,"Seniors who speak to medical professionals in ICU’s dealing with elderly Covid 19 patients on respirators quickly learn the awesome reality that those who survive are almost invariably compromised and “never the same”. The reality is that for seniors there are no “2nd chances” after catching Covid-19. Staying home and away from crowds/shopping may become tiresome.
But it does bring the great gift of waking up to enjoy another day."
2020-07-20 04:23:01,"I am 73 and sealed into an apartment in California. I was relieved to get to the end of the article and discover that Dave Nathan did not to to Lake Placid. Dave, please don't let anyone talk you into going to London in September. 

It just isn't worth it. There will likely be a vaccine sometime next year. London will still be there.

Many older people getting covid do not make a full recovery, or recovery may take a long time. Just not worth the risk."

Nevertheless, except for exercise, picking up groceries, and buying gasoline, I expect to stay as far away from others as possible at least into the fall months. If it takes longer for the pandemic to truly die down, then I'll continue to isolate myself. I know I'm fortunate to be able to do this."
2020-07-20 08:18:48,"I live in Europe. Does the wife know what's happening in the UK? Of course she shouldn't come to Europe and definitely not go to the theatre.  My husband and I are both 67, living in Prague, healthy, but would not consider taking an airplane at all not to mention one across the Atlantic Ocean. Certainly wouldn't go to the UK where the government handling of the virus is a mess. I am amazed how little Americans seem to understand about the severity of this virus, but what's happening around the world. It doesn't hurt to keep your sights on local friends until the cases go way down and there's a vaccine."
2020-07-18 11:19:28,"50 years ago, I chose to move to Denmark, and at that time most people would have said my prospects for a comfortable life would have been at least as good, probably far better had I remained. Today, it is shocking to read what my American cohorts are facing.
The fatality rate from Covid-19 in Denmark has been almost zero since May. My wife and I are planning a canoeing vacation to northern Germany, a country with ¼ of America’s population, yet has just about 10 fatalities per day. My wife, a teacher, will face students in several weeks, which we can accept, since the virus appears to have been tamed. Should it reemerge, anyone who wants a test can get one quickly, and anyone who needs treatment gets it for free. There is no doubt that the government will once again execute a plan based on science if needed.
I just turned 75, and the local authorities called to see if I needed any form of assistance, such as housecleaning, therapies, etc. Yes, America is truly exceptional, and that is by choice, many years of many bad choices."
2020-07-20 10:39:18,"I’m 66 year old widow and live alone in Paris. My son who lives in the US gave me a hard time last night after seeing a picture of me having lunch on a terrace with friends (one lady my age and her parents 90 & 91). He would like me to stay home and see nobody. I have grandchildren (3 & 5) in Paris I have only seen outdoors from a distance and wearing a mask. I have had picnics in the Luxembourg garden with friends my age. We don’t share food. My son who lives in the US with his girlfriend doesn’t understand that I need to weigh between sanity and safety. I haven’t had any physical contact since March 11th but I can’t live without any social time. No, you don’t have the same conversations or laughs on zoom than when you meet people for real. My mother died the week before confinement. There is a limit to what I can take. The calculator gives me a 3,5 risk."

My NJ and California pals are terrified after five months in the midst of COVID. If I had taken the plane for which I had tickets in March I would have been stuck with them. They envy me. I agreed until we opened too quickly and a mess ensued. 

I’m under self selected semi quarantine. Everything gets delivered. See grandkids sometimes. Go to a class at a friends apartment once a week. Lots of spacing and fresh air. Live on zoom WhatsApp and kindle. Had to give up my part time teaching job. And I live alone which is either a blessing or a curse. I pray for RGB’s health and that the election ends Trump’s Reign of Error."
2020-07-20 12:49:54,"Stanton’s Best Advice For Surviving Trump As An Octogenarian:

--- Tune out of all further editions of Trump’s daily fake news follies. He cannot be wished away, but do your best.

--- Take a walk in the fresh air every day in a place that isn’t crowded. Masks optional.

--- Keep in mind that there are always a lot of people worse off than we are, and find a way of helping a few of them.

--- Call some relatives and friends you haven’t talked to recently.

--- Eat and drink in moderation, but happily.

---  Adopt a dog, cat or a horse if you can or do something else that helps animals.

--- Read books and watch movies that make you laugh. This is no time to improve your mind. P. G. Wodehouse and Buster Keaton are always good. (I personally frown on tales of murder, horror and dystopia, but they seem to work for some people.)

--- Think about the times in your life when you were at your happiest. Many of them were simple things that didn’t cost any money and didn’t require any miraculous improvements in our politics.

--- Pray every day, or -- if that doesn’t work for you -- complain to G-d. Someone may be listening.

Perhaps most important of all, do not embark on any personal improvement projects like learning to speak Hebrew, becoming a master chef or cleaning out your closets. All such activities are doomed to ignominious failure throughout these calamitous times."
2020-07-20 12:44:58,"I’m one of those seniors who would like to leave the US. After experiencing a continual decline in all areas of life here, it has become too frightening to remain. The president’s total denial of COVID and his encouragement of racism and violence is no longer avoidable. His ignorant and hateful words and actions leave me no choice but to move elsewhere. 

I feel this country may never repair. And if it does, it won’t happen in my lifetime. I’m entirely disgusted by his supporters. I have dropped friends and family over their racist, religious and sexist beliefs. So, as soon as US residents are allowed someplace, I will go. And just as I’ve sold off most of my belongings, I will rid myself of this vile nation. Leave it to the white, male dominated, homophobic, xenophobic, racist, war mongering, infantile, shortsighted .....

I know there’s no perfect country. But I also know from decades of personal experiences that the of the developed countries, the USA is the most unhealthy and least happy place to live. I just wish that a few of these COVID lemmings would mask up so the cases would slow down enough for me to leave. Then they can party on."
2020-07-20 13:10:50,"“Older people in New Hampshire or Maine — where new cases were falling last week — may reasonably opt for less restrictive behavior...”
This quote from the article should be clarified. Perhaps they may opt for less restrictive behavior in the locale where they live, but I’m sure their risk increases when they decide to travel outside their local environment."
2020-07-20 13:14:13,I might be missing something but I don’t see how to interpret my risk calculation which is 1.6. What does that mean?
2020-07-20 13:18:01,"My father lives independently in an continuing care community where they have had no deaths from COVID, but his quality of life has gone way down due to all his usual social activities being cancelled. His lifetime contribution to family and to solving environmental problems for our world was enormous. Yet at this time in his life when he should be enjoying the fruits of a life well lived he can not have family visit and he has to watch much of his environmental work be dismantled. He ended our phone conversation last night by saying he is discouraged by the country his grandchildren and great-grandchildren are inheriting. It made me sad."
2020-07-20 13:59:01,"Normally, Dr. Fried pointed out, seniors would find decision-making less knotty because the C.D.C. would be providing detailed, science-based guidance for at-risk groups, updated weekly.

“It’s immensely atypical, I believe unprecedented, that we’re not seeing this,” she said. Without that leadership, seniors confront a crazy quilt of changing state and local policies, and “everyone’s on their own.”

That's a very very bad statement. If the CDC actually had done that ... they would have been giving guesses. That's all they have. They've changed their statements over and over. 
That's actually good science ... its seems so many people want them to be dogmatic, even if wrong."
2020-07-20 14:10:11,"My husband and I, both 65, have been locked down tight since the beginning of March. I’ve entered a grocery store once since that time. Connecticut is in a very good place right now so we both did get haircuts wearing masks in places with great safety procedures. Always masked when leaving the house.
The hardest part is not seeing our children and grandchildren who live in the DC area. So, we’ve made what seems to be a good arrangement. One of our daughters/son in law and their 2 boys quarantined for 2 weeks. No stores, no socially distanced get togethers, etc. They drove straight here and stayed for a week. It was wonderful. Our son is coming up today after doing the same quarantine procedures. Not everyone can do that with work and other obligations but it’s worked for us. Who knows what the winter will bring, so before school and other restrictions are upon us we thought it was the perfect time. Unfortunately, my older daughter and her family are required back at work and have started camp with their boys so a shut down for them is not an option. It could be a very long time before we are together."

Granted these are real people, and The Times seems to be writing TO and FOR these people, very well-off, white, planning on a vacation, but worrying about that 'pesky virus'! No, New York Times, most Seniors in this country are NOT the couple that are pictured at the beginning of your article. Most Seniors have other, more pressing concerns than 'Lake Placid'."
2020-07-20 13:39:21,"Judging by the comments, most readers are over 65 and this is not your first pandemic. I am curious as to how you handled the previous ones, did businesses and schools shut down? you were young and they mostly affected the over 65.
This is what I found on the CDC website: the 1957 pandemic, killed 116,000 Americans (US pop. then was 172 million).
 It also killed 1,100,000 worldwide
And the 1968 pandemic, killed 100,000 Americans (US pop. was 200 million). It also killed 1million worldwide."
2020-07-20 14:37:39,"“People of color, obese people and men face higher risk.”  So the Times grudgingly got the British Study’s conclusion half correct, the other half ordered incorrectly by likelihood of severe consequences from the virus.  The Study concludes that it is males who suffer most from getting the virus.  The Times also is flatly wrong about the language used by the Study to describe the conclusion.  The term used in the Study to describe the group suffering most from the virus is ‘Males, not ‘men.’  The NYTimes needs to stop manipulating the conclusions of the British Study!"
2020-07-20 14:31:52,"We live in a pleasant older home on 1/2 acre in a pleasant small city.

Until the infection rate hahs dropped way down or the vaccine is widely distributed, we will:

Shop at stores with everyone wearing amask and social distancing;

Occasionally buy take-out from our favorite restaurants,

And maybe just a hair cut once in a while.

We will not be traveling or flying anywhere. It's not worth the risk, especially in a country when no national response plan led by a lunatic."
2020-07-20 14:46:14,"Without an economy people will end up homeless and starving, but the vulnerable need to protect themselves. Given that the elderly and people with preexisting conditions deathrate is hundreds of times higher than for healthy, young people, it doesn’t make sense to treat everyone the same. Have basic precautions for everyone, mask, distancing, etc, and further isolation for the vulnerable."
2020-07-20 14:54:13,"Most people in the 40-55 age group will choose to wait awhile before getting any vaccine that comes along.  

People under 40 will likely skip it altogether rather than risk possibly lifelong side effects from a rushed vaccine; that age group is hardly threatened by Corona at all.  

So don't count on a vaccine for herd immunity; most of the herd will decline the vaccine (which probably will be less than 60% effective anyway).

We have flu vaccines that almost all elderly people get every year and yet tens of thousands of elderly Americans die from the flu every year anyway."
2020-07-20 16:05:29,"The idea of elders being shut in for 18 months is profoundly unrealistic.

For one thing, a lot of older people still have to work.  I’m 64 and I’ll be working for at least another 2 years.

For another, a lot of us have to take public transportation.  Many older people are no longer able to drive.

But most importantly staying inside your home for 18 months is a good way to go insane.  

Limit your outings.  Wear masks.  Stay 6 feet apart.  But forget plastic wrap or solitary confinement."
2020-07-20 16:03:51,my friends who just got back from a trip abroad are having an intimate dinner - social distancing outdoors with people that they haven't really seen in a long time.  my husband immune compromised and we are all over 50!  there will be one person who is over 80!!!  what are they thinking???  and we are in california!  this is madness to think they will be immune from any of this. the risk is not worth the price.
2020-07-20 16:11:15,"I'm an epidemiologist who, quite understandably, follows the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic closely. It's actually pretty easy. Under no circumstances should people, especially at risk people such as seniors, spend any more time than is essential in indoor environments, shopping infrequently only for necessities for a brief a duration as possible, wearing a properly fitting mask for the whole time indoors. Bars, cinemas, restaurants, churches, public transit and especially aircraft are very dangerous. So is any crowded outdoor space where it is difficult to maintain at least 6 - 10 feet distance from others. Fomites, transmission of virus from surfaces, are less of a problem than initially thought, but practicing vigorous hand hygiene remains essential. Travel, any travel, is simply a bad idea, even with precautions. Outdoor activities where spacing is possible are highly desirable for mental and physical health & should be incorporated into every single day. People who must go into indoor environments because of work should take every precaution, knowing that being inside with others puts them at very high risk of Covid-19. It's not very complicated, but it is difficult to accept."
2020-07-20 16:56:38,"I’m 77 and I just drove from Massachusetts to Montana.  Along the way, I stayed in places that had no contact check-in and digital keys.  I carried my own cleaning supplies and wiped everything down as soon as I entered the room.  I was careful at all stops and felt no more at risk than when I am home where I’m more likely to be out at a market or walking a fairly crowded bike path.  Montana despite having hotspots has fewer actual cases of infection than all of Western, MA.  I am visiting with my daughter for a few days and then I will be camping most of the time for two months.  I will take all reasonable precautions.  

If someone my age doesn’t feel safe, they should do whatever makes them comfortable.  There no real point in doing anything else.  On the other hand, it doesn’t hurt to take a deep breath, gather as much good information as possible and try to assess the real level of risk to you.  Spending 18 months in a hermetically sealed room is, I have to think, an utterly stupid idea.  As I said, I’m 77. I could be dead in three years. I’m not going to put my life on hold for 18 months."
2020-07-20 16:45:25,"How they should calculate their risk depends to a great extent on their living situation. 
 Your photo depicts a well to do white suburban couple whose privilege lowers their risk factors .  They can afford to have all supplies delivered, their home is a distanced, self contained unit, they have access to the best of communications, internet, phones etc.,and the best medical care. 
   Many ,if not most, New Yorkers lack this.  NYT plays to the high end, to the white, to the fortunate once again."
2020-07-20 17:29:05,"We have relatives in New Zealand, and were planning a trip down under when the virus hit the fan. That's now on hold for the foreseeable future. Americans aren't even welcome in the country right now.

Thanks to real leadership, N.Z. has all but beaten coronavirus. I exchanged emails last week with one of our relatives in Christchurch, who was on holiday on New Zealand's west coast. Except for international tourism, things are getting back to normal. He expressed his condolences to us Americans who are headed full speed in reverse."
2020-07-20 18:18:26,"The link to the calculator worked for me, and I was able to fill out the form with accurate date; however, the number it returned is meaningless without more context. 

What I mean by that is: the result is a number expressed as a percentage, labeled as ""predicted probability"" but probabilty of WHAT is not defined. 

For instance, if my calculated result is 2%, does it suggest I have a 2% chance of contracting Covid-19? Over what period of time? With what precautions? Does it mean a 2% chance of death (or perhaps of survival ;-)) if I contract it?

Etc."
2020-07-20 18:19:16,"It feels like it is more dangerous the more things reopen. Our supermarket used to only let 15 people in at a time and had someone sanitizing the carts. Now it’s back to “normal” except that everyone wears masks.  Restaurants that would bring take out to the car now require that you wait in a line, sometimes indoors."
2020-07-20 18:23:41,"Why not let folks decide for themselves, what feels right for them (instead of subtle pressures/shaming for people to conform with whatever the current mindset is)?  The angle of this story, which is focusing on Seniors, is clearly more or less asking 'how can Seniors protect Themselves from getting sick and very possibly dying (due to their age/health condition).'

Do we have articles asking how seniors can protect themselves from dying in a car crash (which is far, far more likely to happen), or from a litany of other ailments that will eventually do a Senior in?

There are in fact many reasonable old folk out there who are not in denial about their own mortality, and just because they want to be able to continue to Live Life, does not have to necessarily mean they are, therefore, being reckless.  Just like everyone else, seniors should take basic precautions.  Aside from that, they should enjoy life, for however many days/ weeks/months/years may remain for them."
2020-07-20 19:12:22,"My mother is 102. I’m 72. We’ve been staying at home since March 12. My mother goes nowhere. I go almost nowhere. Our house and yard is a Covid-19 free zone.

We are grateful for grocery delivery, online shopping, the good practices of the drive through pharmacy and bank, the precautions implemented by the local post office. We are fortunate to have a pleasant backyard, ebooks form our local library, entertainment from several streaming services. Our socializing is by phone or Skype.

We are so fortunate to be able to live this not unpleasant life and plan on doing so until there is a vaccine. We are alive and will survive."
2020-07-20 19:56:04,"Mostly staying home and doing a little outdoor walking and hiking.  Getting lonely; but, have a wonderful roomie.  Psychologically, I take it in increments.   For instance, ""For the next three months, I will continue to isolate.""  The best thing I can do for myself and for society is stay out of the way.  

Although there are ways to minimize risk and still engage socially, my concern is that it is difficult for people to maintain the mask and six feet dance consistently.  I went to a socially distanced event (outdoors) not to long ago.  But I noticed people in the group were starting to remove masks after a half hour or so.  Do I want to be an enforcer?   Not so much ..."

Our constitution is in danger. I think we need to ask ourselves if sitting out this historic year is the way we want to be remembered. Seniors need to fight, too.

We go to the grocery store. He still has to work, but keeps his office door closed all day.  We don't go to restaurants. We don't see family as they're all too cavalier about this to suit us. (Them: But we're family.  Us: And your point is?) If we get McDonald's from the take-out window and the amount is $4.83, we give them a $5 and drive away.

2020-07-20 20:50:45,"Too many friends in health care in NY/NJ and a daughter who's a health policy analyst/modeler drove us into serious isolation. Trips to doctors, to the grocery store and to pick up food from our favorite restaurants have been our only risky activities. That's not likely to change soon. 

The biggest surprise has been obsessive interest in gardening, an old hobby. With little else to do, I managed to add an astonishing number of vegetables to the herb garden ... and then to four new beds. We'll be feeding ourselves and a couple close friends from now till October. I hope I can do it again next year."

I have no ailments or any conditions to worry about except for my age.

We followed the guidelines with masks, distancing, etc.
My work pivoted to remote, but it was a nightmare because I teach hands-on lab courses, and I do not live in a lab.
The amount of twisting in the wind to find a way to deliver my courses was painful and so, given the option of running the courses as a mash-up of a hybrid version next month, I took it.
I will double-down on whatever safety measures are supplied, by bringing my own backups.
I know I am taking a calculated risk, but there are just some teaching and learning experiences that can't be replicated online in the classroom or on the job.
So I will take it one day at a time, carry sanitizer as a personal force field, and de-contaminate when I get home as if I am in a re-make of ""The Andromeda Strain"", but outside of work I will continue to semi-hibernate until when (and if )we ever get an all-clear."
2020-07-20 22:06:36,"First and foremost is to obey the laws and directives everywhere you go, if you choose to go.

Second, if you're not comfortable doing something, don't do it.  Don't let other people make your decisions for you.

Third, don't decide on what you're going to do or not do based on politics.

Cost versus benefit analysis.  Risk versus rewards.  Only you can answer the question but remember you'll get no do-overs.

My opinion is that it's too dangerous out there for most seniors to be traveling about very much.  The situation is bad and getting worse.  Stay home for now.

Wear a mask."

The author might just as well have said, ""I really don't know how you can protect yourself from COVID without going stir-crazy, but I have an article to write anyway"".

﻿, If we had a real president, we could use masks and social distancing to bring it under good control as Europe

This is an incorrect and uninformed statement


France has a real President, and far from getting corona deaths under good control, wound up with a higher mortality rate than the US

As did Sweden, the UK, Italy, Spain ...

The same owner-operators are running theses facilities...the same Lobbyists and equity stakes Wall St investors commodifying old people.                                                           Unless elder reporters like Span and the NYT will get on this and demand accountability for the frail and vulnerable-and finally-years too late-persist in a deep dig into the NYS DOH and its licensing arm -the PHHPC-the evil status quo remains. 
This is elitist parsing and disdainful of journalistic responsibility-the calculations are couched in antiseptic data but not with any pretext of warranted indignation."

2020-07-20 23:29:40,I don’t mind Self isolating until next spring. Ask me around next April how I feel. Hopefully if we get rid of the maniac masquerading as a president we might start to see some light at the end of the tunnel by then￼￼.
2020-07-21 00:02:32,Its shocking to me that so many Americans need to be counseled by health care professionals and  journalists to not act like spoiled children. is it really so bad to enjoy your husbands 80th at home together? how fortunate you have one another. stay at home as much as possible and maybe he'll see 81.
2020-07-21 00:07:15,"I am 65 and see only trouble ahead. I worked hard. Did an ok job with my kids. I’ve had heartache and some good things happen. I miss my old life. I miss my friends. I miss my kids. How many years do I have left?  Barring catastrophe, probably many. My parents are still alive. My grandmothers lived long into their 90s. I just don’t see much of a future though. I’m terrified to go out. I’m terrified of strangers. I’m terrified of everyone. I’m terrified that I don’t matter because I am getting old. I’m terrified that no one cares. How sad. No one cares."
2020-07-21 00:18:36,"I'm tired of hearing that we have to strike a balance between staying safe and re-opening the economy.  This is a false choice.  Countries like Germany, Taiwan, Vietnam, and New Zealand have proven that the pathway to re-opening the economy lies in protecting the populace.  There are easy ways to do this.  Social distancing, mandates for wearing masks, frequent hand washing, testing with quick results, tracing, and quarantining.  Where the government has led the efforts to keep the populace safe the economies are bounding back.  In the US where we have tried to force the re-opening of the economy without having a strategy to keep the population safe we are failing at both.  It's time we Americans get real.  It's not an either/or choice it's a both/and imperative.   Once we get a government that leads in laying out a strategy to protect us and the testing in place to track the virus we'll slowly and safely get back to business."
2020-07-21 00:18:44,"Good story of the lives of older Americans.  We may be at greater risks, but have so many less challenges due to the virus than younger people who have children and need to work.  Not sure I'd want to trade places with them.  As we should all realize, we are ALL in this together.  And, together, we will ALL get out of this mess."
2020-07-21 00:28:29,"My wife and I are very old people who are white and who you'd call privileged.  With that out of the way, we calculate the coronavirus risk extremely high right now.  We haven't exactly locked ourselves in the house, but only go out for true necessities and some exercise.  We mask, we distance.  We read the science as best we can.   We make up our minds based on the science, not on the politics, i.e., phase 1, phase 2, etc.  We're tired of staying home, but stay we will until we determine it's safe to do otherwise via proven vaccine and/or community behavior, and not based on what the politicians say."
2020-07-21 02:16:15,"What about people over 65 looking for jobs and the growing discrimination against them, as they are seen by many to be expensive vectors of disease?

And what about people over 65 who used to be active and are now atrophying mentally and physically -- especially physically -- because are constantly being told to stay inside? Some might prefer to just die now, which I can only assume the many who downplay this illness as being the illness of people who were going to die soon anyway would be thrilled with. How about providing easier euthanasia for people who don't want to spend what may be the rest of their lives indoors?"

2020-07-21 03:43:33,"My husband and I are both over 65.  We would love to go for a walk and have tried.  We live in a very populous area where though masks are required many people are still not wearing them.  When you are walking whether on a sidewalk or on a trail and people are 3, 4. even more abreast and not wearing masks, what can you do?  

My husband finally had it when a larger group was walking toward us and asked them politely, where their masks were.  The one closest to us just smiled and told us if we didn't like it, we did not have to walk there.  

I really don't know what I miss more.  The freedom to go out or just good, old fashion civility."
2020-07-21 03:43:52,"It may take months for a vaccine, but there will eventually be one and it’s worth the wait. 
(If for some reason the elderly are too vulnerable to be vaccinated, this is where herd immunity comes in if all young and most adults are vaccinated).  I remain optimistic that we aren’t talking about a lifetime of isolation.

I urged my elderly mother to work in and enjoy her garden (for a New Yorker, she is relatively fortunate even if the plot is small), go for walks, climb stairs indoors, and stay in touch by phone with friends.

Limit subway use to medical visits if any, and a definite no to her offer to come visit, which would have meant either 4  hrs by train or bus.

It’s not worth risking her life, and the experiences described by those who have  been hospitalized are not anything I’d wish on anyone, certainly not my mother."
2020-07-21 05:56:23,I don't think I've ever seen a better example of the central fallacy of the field of economics than the referenced MIT article. Not everything can be reduced to dollars and a society that asks older people to self-isolate so that younger people can get back to earning those dollars will lose its soul.
2020-07-21 07:25:31,"“We have to find a balance between preserving safety and living”

As an 80 plus senior this is the most important thing I took from this column.  This, and a recognition that the “we” is a very personal we.  Nancy extended her we to include Dave, who as he puts it “finds no need to be daring.”  Finding the balance for Nancy and Dave comes down to Nancy and Dave as individuals and as a couple.  

All us 80 plus seniors are looking for that balance as individuals, some as couples.  We balance the joy of having an older grandchild come to share a beach house that is large enough to allow moderate self isolation while working as a take out waiter or summer lifeguard, and a wish to be around for another summer. We balance the wisdom of passing up a burger night that has  a 6 year old violating your safety space as he talks with about the baseball season opening, so important to him.  It feels like the need for finding a balance has become a full time occupation for some seniors, the lucky ones.  I say, let them do their thing."
2020-07-21 08:38:15,"First off:  Be well, all!

I am 77 and my wife is 68,  We live in Warsaw, Poland.  The last air travel we did was to a medical business meeting in Frankfurt in mid-February.  Two attendees at that meeting later came down with COVID-19.  We mask in stores, but we do eat in a restaurant (our favorite one does adequate social distancing as do most shops throughout Poland).  Since late April we have been shuttling back and forth with my wife's 92-year old Mom, both to her small country cottage and a nearby town.  We play tennis regularly.  

I hope we will be able to visit my kids in the US in late Fall.

Meantime, we have been reading reports in the Times and elsewhere that Italy has gotten the pandemic under control, and that one of our favorite cities, Venice, has taken some strong steps like banning cruise ships from its harbor and basically removing the glut of day-trippers from its pathways, canals, and lagoons... The finest hotels are offering good prices and personalized service, So masked, gloved and disinfectant doused, that is where we are going for our 17th Anniversary next month... hoping not to emulate Thomas Mann's aging protagonist.      

My bottom line is this:  Nobody lives forever.   Everyone can do some simple things to reduce their risk of infection.  If you play by a few new rules, at least you can continue to play."
2020-07-21 11:21:33,"This article made me a little depressed thinking about older people who have to keep working.  There are several custodians where I work, for example, who I'm sure would love to have the option not to leave the house."
2020-07-21 11:49:20,"Canada has handled the pandemic better than the USA, but like nearly all the affected countries failed miserably to triage care for the elderly and known medically vulnerable in some obvious ways, so that infection and mortality have been much higher than needed.  Also gives rise to the question whether locking down everybody for so long would have been necessary if the medical eye had been on the ball instead of the grandstand. 

The idea of vacation travel seems absurd, what can (and can't) you do when you get there?  One of the early stories out of Spain was the island beach hotel where one surprise case caused a mandatory lockdown of all the guests in their rooms for two weeks.  Even at best, as ""reopenings"" regionalize and the locks click open and shut again every week or two, it's nearly impossible to dependably keep up with rules governing recreational venues or predict what they might e, in one's hometown not to say some resort."
2020-07-21 12:15:46,"NY Times should set up permanent FAQ page about Corona virus for elderly that is constantly updated. This will be a great relief for older adults. 

There is lot of information on COVID that is still not clear. For example, is the risk of getting infections higher for older adults? It seems like immunity declines with aging but the risk is no higher says in  the article.  Are we sure about it? Or we just don't have enough data."
2020-07-21 09:42:47,"Oh okay.
So in March-June, any young and healthy person that questioned the strict lockdowns that saw ridiculous measures such as the halting of preventative medical care and the banning of socially isolated sports like surfing, were dumb, redneck trump supporters that didn’t mind ‘sacrifing’ the elderly so that they could continue with their frivolous lifestyles.
But now, with case numbers truly sky-rocketing, it’s completely fine for people who actually are at increased risk to “Find a balance between preserving safety and living.”
Yep, not hypocritical at all."
2020-07-21 11:17:59,"My wife and I, both in our mid-sixties, walk the parks each day here in NYC. It is disheartening and baffling that many unmasked younger people will not take a step to the side as they walk towards us. Some of the paths are quite narrow and we ALWAYS step to the side to try to create 6 feet of social distance. I have Type-2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Where is the basic civility, the common courtesy, the care for one another? How difficult is it to move aside a little? What’s with 3 and 4 people walking abreast on narrow paths?

It’s not just younger people-plenty of mask-less center-walkers are older as well. I’ve gotten into two verbal altercations just by politely asking people to step to the side. I’m biting my tongue as hard as I can, but it gets harder and harder, and my patience is wearing thin. One fellow cursed me and menaced me physically.If not for the fact that it would be even stupider and more unhealthy to have an actual PHYSICAL altercation, I wouldn’t have minded having a go at it."

2020-07-21 12:41:36,"Missing in this is a discussion of what individuals can do to significantly reduce their risk of poor outcomes if they develop COVID-19. Prevent and treat the underlying conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Lifestyle matters. Don’t smoke, eat a predominately plant-based diet, exercise and get enough sleep. Where is the national call for good self care?"
2020-07-21 14:20:58,"I'm 75 years old and have received chemo, radiation and immunotherapy for lung cancer. I am high risk and my husband and I have self-quarantined since March 12th. When our children and and their families come visit us, they self-quarantine for two weeks before. It's not fun - it's awful and it makes me sad. But I do feel safe.

Ironically, I am pressured by my doctors to come to their offices rather than Zoom or FaceTime! I'm told it's the best way to 'evaluate' my condition. Doctors should be finding ways to safely do their jobs (mobile blood draws for example) instead of telling  high-risk patients to break quarantine. At least screen via video appointments which patients need to break quarantine, leave their homes and take the risk to come into their offices."
2020-07-21 13:38:37,"I have recently had first hand knowledge of two cases- one ending in death, the other overcoming the initial stages of the virus but then with lingering conditions that are till serious....

A health worker's 25 year old son owner ""clubbing"" , came home and infected his mother who then went to the senior living complex and infected my friend and his wife- he died and she is still in the hospital seriously ill..

Another friend ( 66 years old) was infected by her beau's son who is in a band and brought home the virus home  to his father who then passed it to his girls friend ( my friend).

Once your bubble is pierced  and you never be certain), you are in trouble, especially if you are a senior.

The next wave- the flu in the Fall- along with the next virus iteration- will be devastating to all of us who passed the first wave.

Will young people suddenly grow intelligence and respect  for others ?

Republican/conservative  governors are closing businesses to combat a growing virus. Wear the mask, control the virus and those businesses will open.  These irresponsible “adults” that can’t go without a party for 6 months are only prolonging the pain.  Read a book, indulge in Netflix, learn to cook, eat healthier, make it an opportunity.  And when you do go out for groceries, thank everyone working in the store for showing up to work for the rest of us.

2020-07-21 15:53:13,"Most people in our neighborhood, even those 40 and over, are choosing not to travel.   To travel, also means to have to use the bathrooms on route, and risk contagion at many points during a trip.  Our family has decided that travel comes with too big of a risk ; this risk taking does not contribute to relaxation.  We can all enjoy our back yard without risk.  Families around us with small children have made their homes a virtual playground, adding trampolines, above ground pools and swings.  Everyone wonders, will they be one of the 40 year olds who dies from this virus, or will their small child be one of the kids who does not make it.  The risks are too big for many people to enjoy traveling now."
2020-07-21 15:52:54,"Here are my suggestions to survive wanderlust until there's a vaccine. 1) Take out photos from a trip you have already taken and enjoy some conversation about THAT trip. Prepare (or order in) cuisine from that country for dinner. 2) Looking forward, take the trip you had planned for September and just make it for same time, next year, when we're more likely to have a vaccine. We all know that the more you prepare for a trip, the more you get out of it so the pandemic offers an ideal time to read about a country's history in depth, read key literary works, study the art and antiquities of that country. After that, sketch out your itinerary and choose hotels, even if you don't book them yet. It's just a matter of exchanging activities that you will do in the future for those you CAN do now. And since our stay-cations are likely less costly than vacations, the next trip that you take can be a little longer and more leisurely, and/or in upgraded accommodations."
2020-07-21 16:06:10,"Yes, 80 is a milestone. But the Pandemic is a menacing creature that can strike anywhere and at any time. Even the most vigilant are susceptible to carelessness. Stay home and  Celebrate on line!  You’ll live to be 90+."
2020-07-21 16:19:55,"I am a 74 year old male in good health. The calculator gave me a .024 chance of having a positive test result. From the article I also learn that for my age group, the chance of being hospitalized if I have Corvid 19 is .08. Assuming that a non-hospitalized case is not serious, my chances of having a serious (hospitalizable) case today is .024 x .08. 

.024 x .08 = .0019 = .19% 

Thus, out of every 526 people in my situation, today one will require hospitalization for Corvid 19. By exercising a bit of prudence, I have little to worry about.	 Probably I have more to fear from overreacting and not going outside to enjoy life and getting sufficient exercise."

2020-07-20 16:37:25,"One of my fondest memories of Camp Lenore in 1967 was a visit to Tanglewood.  It was my first outdoor concert and hooked me for life.  Every summer in our years of living north of Chicago we would take a picnic and our children to Ravinia.  It too has an expansive lawn and pavilion.  For not much money, we were able to introduce our children to classical music in a setting that was comfortable.  They could quietly play games while listening to great music instead of sitting in uncomfortable clothes in a symphony hall.  And we never missed Peter, Paul and Mary who annually made an appearance.  They were pure joy.
I hope one day soon we will all be able to enjoy experiences like these again!  Until then, wear a mask and stay safe!"
2020-07-20 16:58:45,"It is not just Tanglewood that I and others miss.  It is the entire artistic, cultural, and scenic summer festival that the Berkshires were and are.  For a number of years I spent a week in the Berkshires to sing the masterpieces of Bach, Verdi, and others in the Berkshire Choral Festival, at that time located in a private school near Sheffield, a few miles south of Lenox. There were rehearsals in the morning and evening, leaving the afternoons free for sightseeing---and there was much to see---or golf, hiking, or swimming.  There was no rehearsal on Friday night, and many went to Tanglewood for a concert.  I expect and hope that the Berkshires and Tanglewood will be back next summer as good as ever."

2020-07-20 19:31:47,"I spent a glorious summer studying at Tanglewood in 1980. It changed my life. It must be the only such place in the nation that is solely devoted to classical music, with the rare exception of a Boston Pops concert, which would be a mixed bill. I have to wonder, with the absence of people, is there also an absence of mosquitoes, or are there just as many as usual? 
And if there was rail service from New York to Tanglewood, to Lenox and/or Stockbridge or with connecting buses, how many more people would flock there, normally? I think attendance would soar by at least 40 percent, between New York and Boston's populations. 
The BSO is basically the finest orchestra we have, and Tanglewood is the ideal summer festival."

Despite the virus, bucolic Western Mass. is still a treat."
2020-07-20 21:29:39,"Tanglewood is magical. Whether sitting in the shed on a Saturday morning listening to a rehearsal, picnicking on the lawn and feeling the music wash over you, or just wandering the grounds and visiting the lovely buildings (what beautiful wood!), it is both exciting and blessedly tranquil. The dreadful traffic and the messy parking are the penance. The eclectic programs are matched by the equally eclectic audiences. 
I have a wonderful, tangential memory: playing tennis in the court next to Yo Yo Ma and Emmanuel Ax in a loud, joyful match."
2020-07-20 22:12:08,Norfolk Music Festival in Norfolk CT is a little known gem.  Come see a performance next Summer. Acoustically perfect red cedar shed. Top notch musicians. Grounds for a picnic.  No traffic. Gorgeous grounds.
2020-07-20 22:43:28,"I love the Saturday rehearsals as much as anything else. I had a great seat in July, 1998 and I listened intently to the dynamic between Itzhak Perlman and Seiji Ozawa as they discussed minor changes to the score. The orchestra would swell and carry on for perhaps 24 bars until one of them would call for a stop. It was amazing to eavesdrop on that. I love Tanglewood!"
2020-07-20 23:16:52,"I still miss the five summers spent at Tanglewood as a member of its high school summer music program.  We tramped from the dormitories through the Tanglewood grounds, hearing the Boston Symphony rehearsing to the right, and Yo Yo Ma rehearsing to the left.  We hopped the fence -- much to the chagrin of security guards -- and mozied down a side road to the lake where we found more musicians swimming in the summer heat before making the return journey.  In the evenings, we journeyed into Lenox for ice cream cones and pizza.  What wonderful days."
2020-07-20 23:21:22,"So many things have been lost this year.  Sadness is epic.  But for some reason, when I heard on the radio that Tanglewood concerts were cancelled this summer I wept -- spontaneously.  It just seemed like the last straw.  Not that I get there as often as I like, especially now when I live a bit further away than in the past, but I try to do at least ONE Sunday afternoon a summer, and always listen to the concerts on a local station, WMNR in CT.  A summer Sunday at Tanglewood, on the lawn, with friends or alone, with spectacular views, music to soothe the soul, a nice picnic,  (and for some reason no or few biting bugs on that beautiful lawn) -- all that is part of my life and my memory bank.  I hope to get back next year and for many more years to come."
2020-07-21 00:38:30,"I spent several summers in the ‘70s as a counselor at Camp Mahkeenac, a quarter mile from the Lions Gate entrance. The rock concerts were milder fare than a few years earlier; apparently the town fathers felt The Who had attracted an undesirable element. But a Jackson Browne show in ‘77 was very good, and I was thrilled to realize that the policeman controlling pre-concert traffic was none other than Officer Obie. Besides, just down the road was the late great Music Inn, which offered some terrific acts, including a ‘75 just before Born To Run Springsteen."
2020-07-21 00:47:44,"I had my tickets already purchased for the season and planned the rest of my summer vacation time around those performances. The cancellation announcement was  later than most every other arts organization in the Berkshires, and I hoped against hope that there would be a way for some kind of live performance. (In hindsight, I now realize that management was spending the delayed period crafting a virtual schedule.) 
Lots of special memories, but the one that immediately comes to mind is the performance last summer by Yo-Yo Ma of the complete Bach Cello Suites. Glorious! Timeless music sensitively rendered by a national treasure."

I didn't search the Internet to confirm whether or not Joni Mitchell ever performed at Tanglewood, but her lyrics sum up life in these times rather well:

""Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone""

For just one season, we hope!"
2020-07-21 15:16:17,"My mother died of COVID-19 in May. We have been “attending” concerts for 50 years. As I walked the grounds this week, I was flooded with beautiful memories and felt her presence. But “attended” is an insignificant  word to describe the experiences of Tanglewood.

I grew up on the back road to Tanglewood, Cliffwood Street and everyone in my family had some kind of connection to the festival.
Although we moved to Boston, we returned in the summer and my parents were more relaxed at Tanglewood than anywhere else. They retired to the Berkshires and their greatest joy was bring their grandchildren to concerts. 

My own children are in their 20s, living in different parts of the northeast, and busy with careers.  But John Williams and film weekend are an annual ritual.  My daughter is one of the many lawn goers who brings a table, linens and the crystal candles. She was thrilled to learn that staid Tanglewood once had rock concerts. My older sisters saw The Who in 1970; just blankets, pot, and wine. 

There are many ways to experience Tanglewood; in the shed, on the lawn, running through the maze, and watching the fireworks over the Stockbridge Bowl after the 1812 Overture.  I never imagined walking the quiet grounds during a pandemic. But Tanglewood gave me a respite from this devastating pandemic and memories of mother’s favorite place."
2020-07-21 15:38:33,"I've been there several times.  Once, when the 1812 Overture was being televised live, I snuck up to the front row just feet from Erich Leinsdorf.  The good old days."
2020-07-21 15:42:02,"Great article on the Berkshires but she missed the fact that the premiere theatre in the county, Barrington Stage Company, has figured out a way to have a safe, socially distanced  summer season."
2020-07-21 06:58:48,..... and not a word about Leonard Bernstein ? - really!
2020-07-21 10:42:37,A wonderful place especially if you lived in Western Massachusetts.
2020-07-21 18:47:07,"My mother use to drive us down to Tanglewood from Vermont and listen and see Leonard Bernstein conduct Beethoven. After ward she would take Mr. Bernstein's pulse as she was a nurse and his health no longer robust.
My sister was there when the violinist, 14 year old Midori broke her strings and without missing a beat was handed a violin by her colleague and continued to play til the finish.
Great memories. My mother also use to drive down and listen to Andre Previn give lectures.
Thank you Tanglewood."
2020-07-21 21:00:35,"I read about Tanglewood decades ago, when I was a teenager living in the Canadian Pacific Northwest. I assumed the accounts of the place must be exaggerrated, it sounded impossibly magical; starry nights on the lawn listening to the best classical musicians in the world while picnicking. Who could imagine a place so elegant and so bucolic?

Well, I married an American in 2011, and we attend Tanglewood every year. I am still struck dumb with wonder at least half the time we're there. We've dined with friends and attended alone, the lawn is our favorite place on a summer night. (weather permitting)

Tanglewood is like a scene from a romantic movie. There are nights when there are telescopes set up to see the stars. They are older couples with crystal, china and cut flowers on their folding picnic tables, there are couples dancing cheek to cheek, as their grandchildren play on the lawn, like a scene from a contemporary Renoir painting.  The Berkshires are special, everything about the place is dusted with magic. We are spending our summer this year in the gardens and the forests of the Berkshires but we know those starry nights with James Taylor, Beethoven, Berlioz, and  YoYo Ma, and John Williams, (among many others) will return. We have faith in that."
2020-07-20 10:37:16,"Food is fundamental. If you are hungry, you do not focus on learning or work. A strong country feeds its people. Food comes first."
2020-07-20 11:00:08,"The SNAP program is one of the smartest and most beneficial ideas that this country ever enacted. I can't fathom anyone begrudging helping people buy food in hard times. The expanded SNAP has been a Godsend for me during the pandemic. It has meant the difference between scraping through the month, putting food items back or being creative in deciding who will get paid and who can wait. In Florida, the economy is never stable being too dependent on tourism and a focus too geared to growth, a lousy foundation. Gov. Ron DeSantis can be forgiven anything regarding the corona virus because he has made sure applying and qualifying for SNAP would be smooth. Children are out of school and thus, the poor are not able to get the free means that are often the only time needy children get a meal. SNAP has really come through in those situations. Single men, who in this state might as well not exist as they get NO help in bad times  (other than unemployment) can get SNAP benefits. Who in the world would complain about this program? One can only buy food, and that's something everyone needs. It helps inject money into the grocery stores, which in turn employ people. I hope those nay sayers especially President Trump see the benefits of SNAP."
2020-07-20 11:35:38,"We have an administration that drowned our federal government in the bathtub and rendered it incapable of responding to the pandemic.  Now states that didn’t expand Medicaid, states with the lowest minimum wage, states with no state income tax and no masking mandate - all now have the highest need for public assistance.  

Republicans can’t, won’t and don’t govern.  Please stop electing them.  Find another outlet vote your anger and resentment."
2020-07-20 11:43:49,I've been getting food stamps for 2 years and it's a big help but there should be restrictions on what you can buy. Why not eliminate candy and soda? for example
2020-07-20 12:01:15,"Actually, you know what would be more reliable: giving people that need money: MONEY.

I am absolutely dumbfounded by the democrats inability to get this right. They have constructed labyrinthine systems that require inhuman attention to detail and perseverance to get because they are not simple and that complexity and non-transparency allows Republicans to throw up any number of roadblocks in the name of ""draining the swamp.""

To fight this pandemic, the democrats needed to loudly declare this multistep plan:

1. We will send 2k a month to every citizen until Mcconnell and Trump do their jobs and get the vaccine they promised.
2. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE PLAN.

The fact that they cannot help but put their socialist agenda of government controlled food, housing, property and business above saving lives and the economy is unbelievably disheartening.

I knew Republicans were evil. That's the POINT of the party. I didn't realize just how dumb the democrats were."
2020-07-20 12:05:58,"We must not let people go hungry.   

“Oh my God, dude, I didn’t have to worry about whether I can feed my kids,” Mr. Baker said, recalling his relief. “I don’t want to be dramatic and say it saved my life, but it saved my mental life, “

Food stamps are an immediate stimulus to the economy, which support farmers, grocery stores, truck drivers, etc.. 

I can bare the embarrassment of not being able to travel to Europe, and our general failure at addressing the pandemic so that schools aren’t able to open but none of us should accept children or adults hungry ."
2020-07-20 12:12:17,"Good program but as mentioned in article the benefits provided are not enough for a whole month and the income levels too low.   SNAP benefits are more efficient than food banks or food pantries because the person gets to choose what they want to eat and not rely on a food bank's choice.   Supermarkets are often closer to consumer in distance and open more hours.  Food banks and pantries waste a good deal of money transporting, storing, sorting, and cooling food.   Supermarkets already have distribution networks, and storage and are more efficient."
2020-07-20 12:09:18,"I got food stamps seven years ago during a bad illness. It was kind of embarrassing, because I eat so cheap and they gave me lots of money. Heck, my cat was eating like a king.

It's nice they give the little cards, so people can look like they are using regular credit cards."
2020-07-20 14:06:28,"On a tangential issue, along with financial help for the hungry I wish there were a way to help farmers who are dumping milk and meat producers forced to discard what they can't sell to get that food to market."

2020-07-20 14:33:33,"Americans believe in incentivizing the poor by taking everything away from them, including food, medicine and shelter.  This is what America has voted for since Reagan.  Only the rich should be incentivized by giving them taxpayer money for doing nothing. Only liberals think helping the poor is actually helping them. America needs to continue to vote GOP for more independence and real Freedom."
2020-07-20 14:27:20,"Food stamps help people in need fairly quickly. When people had a delay in their unemployment or stimulus check, they had no income. Being stressed about if you can eat or not was a wide spread worry in the United states. Now, they proved that getting rid of food stamps would be a big mistake seeing in the first 3 months of the corona virus the use of food stamps skyrocketed."
2020-07-20 12:36:26,Ask the folks at the American Enterprise Institute if they’re concerned about corporations becoming “dependent” on tax breaks and bailouts to fund stock buybacks so that their CEOs can justify obscene salaries. SNAP is about putting food on the table for American families; spare me the moral shaming from conservative “think tanks” who happily ride the gravy train funded by the Koch Bros et al.
2020-07-20 14:28:47,"Mr. DeParle has focused on the food stamps that have made it to 6 million new enrollees,  and  featured  a photo of individual in supermarkets, while this paper featured a heartbreaking article  featuring  haunting photos of Americans  , including children, who have been forced stand on blocks' long lines, in the sweltering heat, wearing masks ,while waiting to receive a bag  food, because the government refused to give those people food stamps.

Did Mr. DeParle miss that heartbreaking  New York Times piece ? Had he missed the drone footage of  Americans lines up for miles in cars waiting for food donations ?

Is he unaware that 30 million American children  , many of whose one meal a day was the lunch that was provide  at schools,
were left  by the government to go hungry ?

He has painted a  false  picture that suggests the the government has ensured that Americans have not been left to go hungry as a result of the pandemic.  That may be the case of the  six million new enrollees in the food stamp program.

That is not the case of the  30 million American children who were left to go hungry  when their schools closed ,or of all the Americans who  have been forced to stand online   for entire days
waiting for a single bag of food."
2020-07-20 12:29:28,Education funding needs to mimic food stamps: provide a stipend that follows the student and allow parents to choose the most appropriate school for each child.
2020-07-20 14:41:14,"For years I have argued with conservatives who have attacked people receiving SNAP food benefits and every other safety net program. All of the criticism from them about people receiving food benefits as being “ lazy”, “freeloaders”, and the classic, “get a job” line. I always said that there may come a day that you will be the one receiving these benefits and you will be singing a different tune. That time has come. And within a few more months tens of millions more will be applying for these same benefits that they complained about others receiving, and finally realizing how you cannot even survive healthily on the grossly inadequate amount of benefits you receive. 
My wife and I are both in our late 50’s, disabled, cannot work because of our disabilities, receiving a little over $1,000 total in S.S.I. benefits and just over $170 a month in food benefits. We cannot pay our monthly bills will S.S.I. and cannot feed ourselves on $170 a month. We only eat once a day because we cannot afford more. Many talk that if you received benefits you won’t want to work. They are insane. I wish I could work again because I am so tired of worrying about trying to survive day by day. Our roof is caving in from leaks, our bathroom floor has caved in because of a plumbing leak, and our toilet has been broken for over a year. No program will help us to get repairs. And things are just going to get worse for us. It’s enough to make you want to give up."
2020-07-20 13:27:33,"Food stamp relief should be increased during the pandemic.  Emergency food distribution by local food banks is a very inefficient and hazardous approach to helping ease widespread food shortages.  Access to increased food stamps allows families to select the food they need, distributed by professionals who can better practice safe techniques directly from farmers and wholesalers using existing efficient supply chains.  With farmers destroying food and many citizens experiencing hunger we need a different more efficient approach.  Food stamps is the answer.  Large supermarket chains should accept donations to add to food stamp allotments (with supermarket matching funds) and food stamps should be available to all who are collecting expanded unemployment.  It's a no brainer.  Congress should act to include this in the next round of economic support legislation."
2020-07-20 15:01:31,"SNAP alone is not going to be able to keep people from hunger. As a social scientist who has focused on aid programs in my research I’ve watched first hand as people went without meals to feed their children or put expired foods donated from supermarkets on their tables. And even then, when on top of SNAP they had access to food banks, they still had days at the end of the month where they went without food. And it isn’t like these people can work. Sometimes it’s grandma who took in her grandkids when her daughter became addicted to meth or a single mother with a three year old who she can’t leave home to work and she makes less than childcare costs. This was before COVID19 and the resulting pandemic. Now, with the newly poor putting strain on pantries, each family takes home even less help so that all can get some- so you are looking at adults & children going w/o meals at the end of the month w/ the current system. And this is just considering food security. The coming wave of shelter insecure and jobless households is a much scarier and more difficult issue to address. We have more than enough food in this country to feed the hungry so long as the wealthy choose charity over greed (as in they don’t simply waste food, they donate what they will not sell). I don’t know that we have near the kind of social safety net infrastructure anywhere  to deal with the magnitude of need we are about to have. I know we don’t have the capacity in rural places."

2020-07-20 16:13:16,"My income was destroyed 5 years ago. I now make about 1/20th of what I used to. Consequently, SNAP benefits have helped enormously.  However, I know people with large familes that would go hungry very hungry if not for these benefits. Of course, in the deep south (where I am today), the state has sharp limits on people who already are already receiving ""maximum benefits"". They are dirt poor, but need so much more. Being single and white, I am fortunate. They aren't. These are clearly racial motives designed to keep people of color down. So typical. Of course this is not a solution to Covid19, but it really helps some people. I do not understand why more money is not sent to people living at or below the poverty line. $1200 does not go very far when you are a large family. They need financial help far more than me."
2020-07-20 16:47:15,"The SNAP program saves lives and feeds those who have no money for food.  It's also misused and full of fraud.  But, the benefits far, far outweigh the problems.

As prices in the markets skyrocket and certain items become unaffordable, only food banks can and will step in to help fill the shortfall.

Why, in heaven's name, haven't we cared about this immensely valuable program in our Care's Act?  Why is this administration the most despicable and callous in history?"
2020-07-20 16:38:49,"Everyone that needs assistance should get it on a need-basis. However, we just opened the mail once we came back from vacation and found an EBT card for our child.

2020-07-20 15:37:24,"I spend less than $500 a month to feed a family of 4, including some takeout meals. How can there possibly be food insecurity or hunger when SNAP pays more than this for a family of 3? And look at the evidence (plenty of obesity and no skinny people). What are these people buying, eating and wasting? I'd like to see an article with these details. Add in $1000/month of unemployment benefits and the laid off have never had it so good. This pandemic is a liberal redistributionist dream."
2020-07-20 17:16:29,"During the Great Recession, the husband (now ex) was out of work for 16 months following his retirement from the US Navy. No savings, so after a rather short time, I applied for Food Stamps. 

We had a small income, about $1500 per month gross for a family of 5. This did not even cover our mortgage and electric. Our Food Stamps award was $267 per month, about $0.59 per person, per meal--about average.

Yes, I put meals on the table for $3 each. For 6 months. 

The ex lost 20 lbs off a frame ill afforded to lose weight. Each of our children, age 10-17 lost 15-20 lbs. They were slim to begin with. Me, who has always been heavy, but was prone to skipping meals so the children and the ex could eat, lost 50 lbs (about 1/5 of my body weight). Despite heavy use of the foodbank (a monthly bag from the food bank was maybe 1 meal for a family of 5), we were starving. Everyone was hungry all the time.

The ex couldn't wait for a good job, he took whatever job he could get and remained woefully underemployed for years after. 

The take away:
* Food Stamps payments are not high enough. They cover roughly 1/3-1/2 your food budget. You are expected to somehow magically create the rest.
* Too much is taken away for existing income. Food is not the only required cost: shelter, utilities EXIST, and are often unchanged from when you had income.
* It is completely insane to assert that people won't want to work if they get Food Stamps. Your family STARVES on Food Stamps, just a bit more slowly."
2020-07-20 16:44:13,"Without a poverty buffer, which is what SNAP does- providing food  to avoid starvation. End SNAP and grocery store looting will commence. People will do what it takes to survive. We have lost our farming infrastructure."
2020-07-20 17:09:49,"There is an  assumption that people can walk into a big box grocer and purchase anything they want.  Many rural communities do not work that way. Small town stores may charge much higher prices for goods. Availability of goods might be limited. This impacts the food budget. 

SNAP does not cover some necessities. Booze and cigarettes are not covered...sensible. However, you need cash for soap, toilet paper and tampons.....not sensible.  

Increasing SNAP has been a boon to my small community that depends on tourism. Covid has hit the town hard. Many of these folks are cash strapped. Without help they would be hungry."

2020-07-20 16:32:01,"Time to recall the book of Rutger Bregman Utopia for Realists and How We Can Get There, about the most pressing challenge for humanity is moving to a new stage of capitalism and creating a better society for everyone.

Flaws within the existing system Utopia for Realists offers a wide-ranging critique of the individualism necessitated by the broken deregulated neoliberal economic model. Dangerously dysfunctional, modern capitalism is making us depressed, indebted, and spiritually bereft. 

“A culture that encourages us to spend money we don’t have on stuff we don’t need, in order to impress people we can’t stand. Then we go and cry on a therapist's shoulder. That’s the dystopia we live in today”.

Capitalism’s spoils, Bregman writes has become alarmingly skewed away from those who ‘add and create value, leading to dangerous levels of economic inequality.

The case for universal basic income is evidenced by its successful trials on a small scale., such as when Dauphin, a small town near Winnipeg in Canada, guaranteed each of its 13,000 residents a basic income of $19,000. The experiment lasted four years; the statistics collected showed that the town made huge strides in social progress during its implementation. <a href=""https://www.marketplace.org/2016/12/20/world/dauphin"" target=""_blank"">https://www.marketplace.org/2016/12/20/world/dauphin</a>/"
2020-07-20 17:44:46,"Apparently the author has never actually been behind anyone in the grocery store actually using SNAP benefits.  Trust me, while many and probably most recipients use them as intended, there are also many people buying much more expensive and frivolous items than milk and bread. I have also stood behind a convenience store owner at Costco who pulled out a stack of EBT cards to pay for his purchases, which included several cases of cigarettes; when one was out of money, he pulled another out of the stack.  Obviously, he was buying them for cash from recipients.  One need only read the papers to know that fraud in this program is rampant.
There were several quotes in the article from left wing organizations, but none about the fraud in the program.  We are in unprecedented times in our lifetimes, and no reasonable person begrudges those who are truly in need.  That doesn't mean that the administration is wrong about fraud in the program."

2020-07-20 18:11:51,"One ancillary benefit of the SNAP program is the way those benefits are enhanced by the support of concerned citizens. 1000s of farmers markets accept SNAP cards, and many have some form of matching program that doubles the funds received up to a figure ($25 max is typical). Here's a story about a participant at the Evanston, IL market: 

""S heard about the program from the District 55 Family Center. She feels lucky and grateful to be participating in it. Though she works several jobs and receives public aid, finances are tight. Without the dollar matching program, she would not be able to buy the higher quality produce of the farmer’s market for herself and her daughter. She says that the program makes her food stamps go further and consequently, they don’t feel a sense of deprivation. This allows both S and her daughter to eat more fresh, organic food which she says is so important to her because she
really wants her daughter to grow up as healthy as possible.

I work with the group that raises funds for the match and coordinates with the city to see that the funds reach their target. Usage is heavier than ever, but our citizens have responded to the need with generous donations to the program. I also work at a farmer's stand at the market weekly, and I have heard many stories like the one above. I'll tell you, this method of distribution lets SNAP users just shop like anyone interested in healthy, local food. There is no stigma in the tokens they use to pay. It works!"

The thing thats broadly appealing about the recent conversation about “universal” benefits is just that, they are universal to all citizens. Everyone gets it. Its a fantasy that Americans are going to establish an ironclad, politically sustainable socialized welfare state for such a heterogenous, immigrant expanding and irresponsible procreating population. No one wants to hear we can’t live like the Danes. Instead of pandering for votes dangling funds from social programs, loudly turn the screws on the super wealthy, move that money into universal rewards... and here’s my 2 cents on it... actually make your citizenry give back via civil service or volunteerism in order to get some of it. If we want to live in an incentive based society, its about time we offer an expanded social welfare system with those same principles."

Feed a child a quart of milk. 1/2 a loaf of bread, a package for frozen vegetables (microwaved) and 3 eggs a day, and you have gone a long way to satisfying his nutritional requirements at a cost of less than $3/day.  Do some real cooking, adding some brown rice and beans, for example, and you can add a lot of variety.,

The Claim: Always Wash Your Hands With Hot Water, Not Cold - By Anahad O’Connor

With swine flu sweeping across the country, health officials are reminding Americans to wash their hands often to reduce the spread of the disease.

Soap and warm water have long been said to prevent the spread of infections, but is warm or hot water really more effective than cold?

[...]

...in a 2005 report in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, scientists with the Joint Bank Group/Fund Health Services Department pointed out that in studies in which subjects had their hands contaminated, and then were instructed to wash and rinse with soap for 25 seconds using water with temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 120 degrees, the various temperatures had “no effect on transient or resident bacterial reduction.” 

They found no evidence that hot water had any benefit, and noted that it might increase the “irritant capacity” of some soaps, causing contact dermatitis. “Temperature of water used for hand washing should not be guided by antibacterial effects but comfort,”...

I can tell readers of the difference in the way cleaners are regarded and treated in China.

A frightening and distressing and revealing article."

2020-07-17 20:26:14,"Excellent article. Have you ever been a cleaner? It is actually difficult to clean that meticulously all corners of a large, continuously-used area. I don't blame them that it's not done to the standards the companies have set forth. I, for one, know how difficult it is to keep my own house clean...definitely not interested in jumping into publicly overused spaces (airplanes, theme parks) with the absurd expectation that wiping down ""every two hours"" will save me. No thanks."
2020-07-17 19:58:09,"I am so tired of ""deep cleaning"", ""sanitizing"" and ""disinfecting"".  It's just not happening. The example of airplanes is perhaps the most glaring.  To get a 737 reasonable clean would take tens of person hours. To ""deep clean"" would involve disassembly of the interior."

2020-07-17 20:48:10,"While I can’t thank custodians enough for the brave work they have done since day 1 of the pandemic, I am curious to know if all of the efforts towards disinfecting surfaces makes a difference in preventing transmission of covid. I tend to think we devote so many resources to disinfecting surfaces because it is a highly visible way of saying to customers and employees “look how hard we are working to keep you safe” when in reality you already caught the virus from the asymptomatic passenger on the subway, or the friendly waiter who lingered for a conversation after you paid the bill."
2020-07-17 19:28:13,"Ah, the invisible help.  Saying hi or acknowledging their humanity would be bad luck and might cause one’s stocks to slip.  Better to treat them as lower than dirt, like Portnoy’s mother did."
2020-07-17 20:39:53,"Bingo! Thanks for shining a light on this problem. Businesses tout “cleanliness”, but are they allocating the funds for protecting workers and making sure they have the resources to do the job right? All the handbooks and training videos are for naught, otherwise. Everyone is concerned about the bottom line, but employee safety must be factored in. If employees can’t do the job right, then “cleanliness” is a myth."
2020-07-17 20:21:22,"""They are often not told if someone has tested positive where they are working, many said in interviews, making it difficult to protect themselves and others.""

In that case, assume everywhere you go and everything you touch is infected. Take maximal precautions at all times. Never get lax. If there's one lesson many of us are learning, it's up to us to save ourselves."
2020-07-17 20:27:11,"Excellent article! If only more of the news we read was about people we actually encounter on a day to day basis. People have all sorts of high opinions on events that they have little chance of altering. We could easily lift cleaners, maids, movers, cooks, drivers, and other essential workers out of this peril."
2020-07-17 22:07:46,"One of the few places over the years that I've seen the cleaning staff get a fair amount of support and respect was in the critical care unit of a large academic hospital. And believe me, if you have been in or around a busy medical ICU for any length of time, you might appreciate what a difficult job it must be, when done right.  I guess in that environment, it was a bit easier to see how it can ring true that ""everyone working here is in this together"".  A little bit more of that realization in our current lives would help."
2020-07-17 20:57:25,Since when did business titans do the right thing?
2020-07-17 22:00:37,"This shows the utter moral  bankruptcy of American big business. They make cleaners risk their lives for $8.56 an hour, without giving them adequate cleaning equipment, much less PPE. They lie to the public and their customers about how clean their planes and stores are, while boasting about their ""safety"" measures. The old adage that with unregulated capitalism ""it's your money or your life"" has never been more true. And Trump is hand-in-glove with all of this,  busy deregulating everything he can, promoting a brand of beans in the Oval Office because the CEO likes him, suppressing public information about the pandemic, and sending federal officers in unmarked cars to arrest people for protesting without the permission of local government. Will the American experiment last until Nov. 3? I am beginning to wonder."
2020-07-17 21:15:36,"Respect. If there’s no respect for life in general, just respect for money and those who have it, this is the soul-crushing result.  When I lived in Japan, I did some person-on-the-street interviews and asked them who they respected most. People who kept them safe and clean. Universal healthcare is a given for a healthy, respectful society that pulls together in good times and bad.  Maybe taking a page from that book, even if we by definition, make it our own, wouldn’t be so bad... Respect for oneself means you fight for universal healthcare because that’s what we deserve. Respect for life on Earth means you treasure what we have and want to not kill it. I still have hope we can do this! <3"
2020-07-17 22:03:43,"Jodi Kantor provides clarity about the risks that the lowest wage earners face in the custodian business.  There is a lack of responsibility in the business community, driven by high powered corporations, to pay appropriate amounts of money for customer service.  By undercutting the number of people necessary, or restricting tools, our health is a risk.  Outsourcing to save money demonstrates a strategy ""to pass the buck"" to others with less power.  Thank you Jody Kantor for revealing some of the hypocrisy that American business continually shows, in order to make more profits at the expense of their ethically duty to actually be leaders.  COVID 19 should be a wake up call for these corporations to re-think  their conservative way of doing business."

As someone who worked their way through college and grad school as a janitor/custodian/porter/commercial, residential and industrial cleaner, this article really resonated with me.  But to say our ""old job"" was just ""tidying up"" is really insensitive, and it is the attitude that has led to such low pay for those of us who actually did the job.  

We have always saved lives.  It is just that most people didn't have an appreciation for what we do..."
2020-07-17 22:04:02,"Even if all cleaning/disinfecting measures that various employers institute are actually instituted by ALL employers, they will certainly be shown to be inadequate, because it is nearly impossible to do a perfect job of cleaning and disinfecting.

Ideally, every airplane restroom would be disinfected after each use, not once a day, or even before every flight, because scores of people will have used them.

Ideally, every surface of a plane that passengers touch would be disinfected after each use (seats, seat belts, tray tables, arm rests, window blinds, overhead bins and their latches, etc), not once a day, or even before every flight.

Ideally, restrooms in office buildings would be disinfected after each use, not once a day, or every couple hours, after an unknown number of people have used them.

Ideally, every doornob and handrail in office buildings or multi-unit homes would be disinfected after each use, not once a day, or every few hours, after multiple people have used them.

Ideally, time and effort would not be wasted on repeated cleaning of phones and computer keyboards that are used by only one person.

Ideally, every janitor and cleaning person would be given extensive training in cleaning techniques during this pandemic, and would be provided with the some of the best protective gear and supplies available.

We are not in an ideal world, and have come to this untenable position because of political decisions made by our leaders.  We must hold them responsible."
2020-07-17 21:11:47,"The new electronic health record had me staying in the office well past the dinner hour. I got to know the lady who came through each night to clean. Over time she began talking about her life in and out of work. It's more than this article can deal with to say that included in this work pyramid you will often find low-grade harassment from the manager who hands out assignments. The little edge of power can bring out the worst in people. The pressure from on high to meet schedules and productivity benchmarks cascades down to the front line people. This article shows how much pressure they work under, but for many, there is an unnecessary measure of anguish added to their load.

3500 years later and it's still ""bricks without straw.""

What comes through in the article is the pride in their work that so many of these people bring to their often solitary shifts."
2020-07-17 22:20:47,"I know how much extra time it takes me to keep my house clean during this pandemic. Wash down products before I put them in my fridge or in our pantry. 
I have often walked up the aisle on a transatlantic flight from the far end of the plane where I usually chose to sit. All along the way is mess and trash folks have left behind during an eight hour flight. Even pre-Covid times, cleaning that up in ten minutes is a super human effort. Add now: really sanitizing tray tables, seats, armrests, et al? It takes much more time. Passing by with a spray disinfectant is not enough. 
I would love to go home, fly again. But no, I cannot. Even if America were not the most dangerous place to go now. I’ve learned to stay home mostly, wear my mask whenever I go out. That’s all I plan on doing this year."
2020-07-17 22:12:15,"I believe the big takeaway from this article is, don't fly anywhere unless it's worth your life to do so.  'Quick turnarounds' by cleaning staff are used in many industries, including healthcare, though most healthcare facilities have testing requirements which help to keep them on track with sanitization and sterilization practices.  Airlines are not going to pay out more money for anything they don't have to, even though passengers spend hours contaminating the areas they occupy.  10 minutes to clean a whole cabin?  I don't need to fly anywhere that badly."
2020-07-17 22:20:16,"What do we call this? 

Whitewashing. No that's taken already. 

Santiskiming works.

Cleaners santiskim your plane before you board your flight.

Cleaners everywhere are essential workers who are forced to work under severe time restraint and lack training in world's best practice cleaning methods. Out of sight, out of mind, nobody cares.

These are not after school jobs.

The nation's cleaners are adults who are raising families. 

If not now, when will they be valued for their labor and paid a living wage?"
2020-07-17 22:26:32,"People like the ones described in this article are some of the most under appreciated and over worked individuals that keep our world from computer falling apart.
I can’t help but wonder what impact the president’s immigration plans have on these heroes and how much more unlikely they are to speak up when they see problems for fear of attracting unwanted attention.
While we spend our stimulus money or are comforted by the extra unemployment available, the people we ask the most from are treated the worst. 
We are only as strong as our weakest link, it’s a shame we don’t show these people more respect."
2020-07-17 21:46:06,"For my entire working adult life -- 35 years and counting, I have watched this country denigrate, disrespect and underpay workers while spending millions on CEO's and senior executives.  I have watched companies and our country value sparkly marketing campaigns, image, and branding as if they were the real deal.  Now here we are.  

Some oldies but goodies - remember when workers were going to be paid as Independent Contractors and get paid so much money they could pay their own SS and health insurance? Scam.   Same for the gig economy - it should be called microslavery instead. 

And now all the check yourself out nonsense, fill out your own airline booking, etc. etc.  Microslavery - every time we do this work for corporations, we are working FOR THEM FOR NOTHING.

Meanwhile, essential workers -- people who have always been essential - get paid a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the CEO's wages, and that CEO would faint if he had to spend one night cleaning one office building, or suite of hotel rooms.  

This country is the greatest con on Earth in terms of caring about workers, caring about ordinary Americans.  

Time for a revolution all right - where people are valued and have human rights to health care, living wages, and freedom from pollution and environmental hazards."

Disney, airlines, etc. you have more than enough money to buy cleaning supplies and protective equipment. Shame on you.

I think it’s a violation of their human rights. And do all of these businesses really expect customers to trust the sanitation levels in their buildings, airplanes, etc.? I don’t, which means I’m will not patronize them until there is an effective vaccine because I am immunocompromised. A solid economic recovery cannot happen until both workers and customers feel safe and frontline workers are paid well for what they do."

2020-07-17 23:50:37,"Not the least bit surprised, unfortunately.  And if there are no visible signs of ‘dirt’, how is anyone to know whether ‘deep cleaning’ has been performed on an invisible virus?  The assumption has to be that you need to wipe down your own space, which at most provides limited protection, esp on a plane. Nor do I count on the filtration systems either - instead jets of air blast and spread the air rather than confine it to your tiny personal space. Empty seat in between ? as if the persons in front and in back of you aren’t close enough, unless you can afford business or first class.

Besides, once drinks and meals are served, any remaining safety precautions are gone."
2020-07-18 00:19:33,"It has always been this way, but the virus has made the consequences much worse. In college I had 3 jobs. I cleaned 7 house each week, I cleaned 1/2 of an office building M-F, and I cleaned a kitchen at a home for disabled children. 

At the office building I split the work with another girl. I had the executive offices and she had the worker bees. One week my co-worker was off so I took her half too. It was a mess. I scrubbed the toilet stalls and behind the soap dispensers, vacuumed places that hadn’t been in years, etc. I guess they put me in the executive side because they knew she couldn’t do it. One woman stayed late one night and told me the staff thought it was deliberate. Not just two different cleaning people. 

Corporate America has always been like this. Look good, especially for the high ranking, and let rest of us fend for ourselves."
2020-07-17 23:43:51,"America, and Americans, used to be known the world over for very high standard of cleanliness and sanitation. One interesting fact is that the spread of American fast food outlets, such as McDonalds, introduced American sanitation standards to many parts of the world and quickly were adopted locally to improve overall sanitation standards in those areas. This famously happened with McDonalds in Hong Kong. So it is very depressing that due to the motive for profit, American places and things are being cleaned too quickly and not with adequate supplies, and by underpaid people who have had little training. What once was something America led the world in is now something that America is declining in— simply keeping itself clean."
2020-07-18 00:17:45,"As a former high school principal, with a district that had resources, our custodial staff had the materials and expertise to clean our classrooms. Having said that, there is no way, we had the staff to achieve the levels of cleanliness outlined in the CDC guidelines. I would add, that we had a major renovation to our building infrastructure that included a total redesign and installation of a world class ventilation system--that is the good news---the bad news---we just do not have the staff--both teacher and support staff---to make the school safe--that is the reality of decades of neglecting a public sector service that has been allowed to deteriorate to what we have now--- a very dangerous school environment for all who enter the schoolroom doors."
2020-07-17 23:47:01,"Cleaners have never been given the tools or the pay or respect the job deserves.  Years ago I was a cleaner in a hotel for half a year, and given the number of rooms each of us were responsible for every day, there was no way the job was performed to what we’d call really clean.  Bedspreads were changed about once a month, and not more often unless they were obviously stained.  Given that most guests throw their luggage on the bed first thing, how can that be called sufficient?  Let’s face it, if you want a clean place to eat, sit, travel, etc, you’re going to have to bring your own cleaning supplies and do it yourself.  This is the advice we are being given now anyway, and many travelers have already been doing that.  I now carry cleaning wipes (if I can find them) in my car to use on shopping carts and so forth.  Are we now expecting teachers to clean their classrooms themselves?  Library staff?  Any public office?  It’s that or call cleaners essential workers and pay them commensurately.  It’s hard work."

I met the custodian and learned his name. Then I wrote a letter to someone at the university telling them of this man’s service. I hope he was acknowledged. 

Whenever I am in a public bathroom and the cleaner is in there, I always thank the person for making the bathroom clean. Usually it is an immigrant. I am so appreciative. I hope others are too"
2020-07-18 00:43:49,"As a paid custodian of many years -- and making a decent wage, but with no benefits or safety net -- it's nice to see an article where we're given our due.

2020-07-17 23:51:07,This does not surprise me whatsoever. I flew American Airlines Business class to JFK from LAX June 23rd.  There was NO SOAP in the bathroom soap dispenser right after takeoff.  During a pandemic no less.  I was really upset and gave the crew a piece of my mind.  The crew apologized to me multiple times.  They knew that was a big no no. Thank god we thoroughly wiped down every piece of hard plastic ourselves.  Yuck.
2020-07-17 23:37:44,I am a DoD Fed. How about the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT! The CARES act supposedly had money for sanitizing these buildings in it. General Services Administration maintains individual departments and orgs are responsible for supplying their own buildings with these supplies/functions. In many cases they already had underpaid skeleton crews already working minimal janitorial functions to save money (I.e. take out your own cube trash with minimal dumpsters to put it in). I feel bad for our janitors - folks unfortunately end up shoving their office trash into places like bathrooms to make ends meet. I’ll believe provisions when I see trash stop overflowing from the break room.

2020-07-18 00:52:38,"Two words guaranteed to send shivers down your spine: “reused rags.” Even well before the pandemic, the sight of restaurant employees wiping down table after table with the same damp rag made me cringe. 

A lot of what I am reading here comes down to poor management. It’s up to employers to train their cleaners, fit them out with adequate supplies, and give them enough time to do the job right. You can point fingers at the airlines or other businesses who hire janitorial services, but the real blame sits with the companies who bid those jobs, while planning to take these shortcuts."
2020-07-18 01:16:31,This pandemic is doing a remarkable job of revealing the infrastructure rot and neglect in this nation. We have to get to work to build something better and stop being distracted by the agenda of those who only care about themselves.

2020-07-18 01:29:41,"One way to make companies more responsible is to install sanitizer machines and provide wipes every 6 feet apart or where there is a lot of hand touching ie:eating areas, near bathrooms, elevators of course the rides etc. The HEB grocery here in Texas was wiping down the carts buff they also had sanitizer machines and sanitizer cloths that I carried throughout the store. Same as the airlines once the cleaners have done a through cleaning companies need to provide supplemental supplies for help maintain. Have sanitizer at the planes entry and everyone must use it. Have the Lysol spray, wipes and things available so men as a flyer can wipe down frequently touched areas myself, the seat belt buckle, the shade, the air vent. I enjoy giving things a wipe myself such as in the restaurant i wipe the back of the chair, the seat where people put their hands go adjust themselves. There are spaces and places that cleaners and janitorial services just won't be able to consistently clean after every use. Its up to the company to protect the customer. If customers are allergic to any products companies need to have a cleaner(s) available. If companies are going to provide a service it is their responsibility to maintain the safety of the customer. Everybody is worrying about making the all mighty dollar. All these companies have more than enough money to provide the required services to provide and maintain safe conditions fir their customers as well as their employees."

2020-07-18 01:51:50,"If janitors and front-line workers are essential during a pandemic, give them hazard pay, not just a useless designation, “essential” to convey their necessity. They’re low paid because we worship college and the knowledge it conveys, while we put it out of reach due to cost, poor public secondary education, and lack of support for those who are first in their families to attend. Not only that, but cleaning is disrespected because it is such gruelling work that few want to do. You would think it’d pay more for that reason.  Instead we ask low-paid immigrants to do it rather than unemployed Americans because we’re unwilling to pay what the job is worth."

Airplanes are much more important. It's not practical for cleaners to clean every item. I expect them to clean the seats and common areas like bathrooms and handles. Belts, arm rests, eating table and screen should be cleaned by the passenger with wipes. These should be provided by the airline al entrance to the plane. The airline should also provide clean air that filters viruses with HEPA filters."
2020-07-18 04:27:41,"Contractors, contractors, contractors! The whole concept of ""contracting out"" work and essential services is utterly bankrupt. Our current ""contracting"" system reminds me of the old cartoon of Tammany Hall where a circle of folks are pointing the finger at each other, endlessly. The upper levels of our society - government, business, hospitals, finance, etc. - have become so irresponsible that the rest of us are entirely dependent upon the personal standards and basic human decency of janitors, cashiers, flight attendants, delivery workers, nurses, and all the rest. God bless them, but they are not compensated well enough or treated with enough respect to bear that burden. What a mess!"
2020-07-18 04:26:31,"Good article. Again, it takes a pandemic to illuminate how much Americans are taken for granted. The filthiness of public spaces, like Subway stations, subway cars, public restrooms in airports, etc.  in the US is just more and more disgusting if you compare them to European counterparts. For example, last year I had the opportunity to visit the restrooms in the Venice airport (Italy, not really a country known for obsessive cleanliness), and they were just amazingly spotless clean and beautifully designed. Walking into a restroom at JFK or any other US airport is an insult on all fronts, as compared to that. Private office spaces are also falling behind, as outsourced cleaning crews who are paid the lowest possible amount aren’t really motivated to put a lot of work into your cubicle or office. People are also wondering, why nearly all US urban environments can neither control successfully lice, bedbugs, cockroaches or rats and other vermin commonly not even found in third world destinations in that abundance. I hope that the focus on more cleanliness will be at least one good thing which may come out of this disaster."
2020-07-18 03:52:25,"There has been a lot of research on how long the virus survives on various surfaces. The result was: a day or two, three at most, depending on the surface. If that is to be trusted, then spaces (offices, schools, airplanes) that get shut down and become unused for a while will be disinfected by time alone. In such cases, there is no need to expose cleaners to freshly infected surfaces or to douse everything with chemicals which may become an environmental problem."
2020-07-18 04:10:51,"I'm glad the airlines are trying harder, given the yucky condition of many plane interiors pre-pandemic, but I can't help feeling that these ""deep cleaning"" efforts, however defined, are mostly security theater.  The moment passengers board the plane, bus or subway car, it's contaminated.  Most of us have seen the video where one person with fluorescent dye eats at a buffet with a dozen other people, and after a short while, turning on the UV light shows everyone is contaminated.  All of the tables and plates and utensils were clean beforehand.  It didn't matter.  The reason I'm not flying now has nothing to do with whether the armrests were wiped down.  It's the people."
2020-07-18 04:11:21,"I worked in several  federal building.  InMinnesota in the 70’s, the custodians were federal employees and our offices were immaculate, restrooms spotless.  Then their jobs were given to contractors.  What a difference!  Dust collected under our desks. Coffee drips on the conference table stayed until the staff cleaned them.  Later, in Milwaukee, I found one of the cleaning crew sleeping in an alcove. If you pay the workers a living wage, you’re likely to get good ones.  The contractors weren’t that much cheaper but the cost included executives’ salaries.  Not much left for the workers.  You get what you pay for."
2020-07-18 04:20:54,"Working as a teacher in a NYC public school building, I know that the cleaning staff is greatly overextended. They only had time to clean the toilet and empty the wastebaskets of my classroom on a daily basis. As someone who used to clean for a living as a college student, I knew what to do and supplemented by cleaning student desks and vacuuming my own rug. I bought my own supplies to do so. 
Now the federal government is not supplying any extra funding for schools to fight Covid. What a joke! Of course, schools will not be ""deep cleaned""! Let's not even talk about the poor ventilation systems!"

When I observed the ""greeter"" at one of my local supermarkets wipe-down shopping carts over and over again with the same filthy rag and some unknown spray bottle mixture, and shoppers not wearing masks and refusing to observe social distancing, I switched to on-line grocery ordering with delivery or contactless pick-up.  At my first contactless delivery with Sam's Club, the young man who came to my car window to check my ID was not wearing his mask and stood 18 inches from me.  I have stopped ordering food through drive-thrus because the window attendants (usually teens or in their early 20's) either have their masks pulled down below their nose or sometimes don't wear it over mouth and nose at all.  I am now stopping contactless delivery of restaurant food after 3 tries because in each instance the delivery person rang my bell and stood less than 2 feet from my front door rather than leaving the food outside the door as instructed. The national grocery store chains and other businesses who just announced mandatory mask wearing for customers should have done so more than 3 months ago.  The governors who refuse to order that masks be worn in all public locations are idiots.

2020-07-18 07:29:59,"In my company a young “executive” once made a presentation where he boasted how he had managed to save a “whopping” 150,000 Dollars per year by cutting down on office cleaning to once a week only. This, in a company with a turnover measured in the billions and where 150,000 dollars is considered pocket change in the big scheme of things. Ah but this young rampant manager made himself visible and thanks to his handsome looks and slick suits sailed off to a big corporate career. Meanwhile, the cleaners saw their work cut by 2/3. 

Fast forward to 2020, that young executive failed miserably when given “serious” jobs and has fallen back in the ranks; meanwhile because of Covid we now have cleaning crews going around the offices 24-7, wiping cleaning and disinfecting every surface to make OUR work environment safe. Everyone now “sees” the previously invisible people: the always smiling Asian lady with the spray disinfectant; the big African guy with his mops and industrial cleaning fluids; the efficient eastern European ladies who move around at speed cleaning our desks, emptying our trash and wiping our bathrooms without breaking a sweat. 

Now we SEE them, and we hold doors open for them, and we THANK them, talk to them and treat them as colleagues, as peers, as human beings. I can see how the entire attitude and respect towards these essential colleagues of ours has radically changed. At long last."

Number one, cleaners have very little time to clean hotel rooms, add a little short cut to it and you have a dirty hotel room, even when it looks clean. Same thing with airplanes, perhaps no more than 10 minutes. Next time you’re in a restaurant, pay attention to how they clean the table next to you that was covered with dirty napkins that people wiped their mouth, and  blew their nose . And the same person brings your food, without having washed their hands, after cleaning that table. Should I say anything about hospital rooms, and schools?"

A month ago, I took a flight from Chicago to Reno, with a plan change in Las Vegas.  Everyone wore a mask, no one complained.  On all segments of the trip, Southwest airplanes were spotless--and it is not hyperbole to write that when those cleaning team members got through with their pre-boarding rituals, the planes looked and smelled brand new.  The floors were clean without a speck of litter, the backs of the seats (thank you for the vacant middle seat as well!) were void of those little weird food-fingerprint stains.  The windows were hair gel smudge and fingerprint-free. I have never felt safer on an airplane than flying Southwest with their cleaning protocol.  If Southwest suggested paying an extra hundred dollars for this level of concern for passenger safety, charge me!"

My impression is that this is a dead end miserable job. Like stories of people who “started in the mail room” and worked their way up, cleaning and janitorial work will only be done with a sense of pride in work and excellent quality if quality work  is rewarded  both financially as well as with career advancement in some way including perhaps a path to further education like on site classes after work."
2020-07-18 06:47:12,"As someone working as a custodian at a college I can confirm what others have already said. There simply aren't the resources or manpower to keep these buildings fully disinfected.
We're responsible for three buildings. The two largest are 400,000sq ft combined (obviously not including surfaces). We disinfect countertops, floors, and doorways daily, to the best of our ability. Thing is, our staff consists of three people right now. There's simply no hope of keeping everything up to our standards even with everyone working overtime.
Meanwhile, the contracted companies running most of these buildings have plainly demonstrated their only goal is profits. No provisions are made to assist the custodial department, and in some cases we're actively hampered. To give an example of the kind of service that can be expected from these contracted companies: when we took over the cleaning of these buildings, certain areas had layers of dust thick enough that a gum scraper was needed to remove it. 
Custodial staffing needs to be expanded, supported, and in-house. Meanwhile use of these buildings needs to be restricted and minimized. Otherwise the disinfecting of these buildings will remain, as someone aptly stated, ""security theater""."

The train conductors stared blankly at me when I asked for it.
2020-07-17 22:06:37,"Unbelievable in Grate America. Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Europe disinfects its streets, disinfects people’s shoes, and people wear masks. Americans don’t have even soap and water! Asian schools have shield on students desks, face masks, and frequent hand washings. Fifty percent is Americans don’t wash their hands after going to the bathroom. The lies about US planes being cleaned? Just that. Do they really think we are dumb enough to fly? Our normal is the most unsanitary country on earth - led by grubby politicians to an impoverished lifestyle. Slaves to Wall Street. Guess that I’m not happy? Those of who worked to make this a better country are more than annoyed at the pea-brained politicians."

2020-07-18 13:59:08,"WOW! I spent several years after retiring from my job as an auditor for the state government as a janitor.  It did not bother me to do this work on a part-time basis because I believe all honest work is honorable and because my mother worked for the state as a cleaner, taking care of the offices and chambers of the state legislature.  This is how she put food on our table after father died. 

People have no idea how much EDUCATION is involved in being a janitor.  It is not just ""pushing a broom"" at all.  One must KNOW how to clean up an sanitize all types of horrific messes and all messes are NOT treated alike.  I will not recount some of my experiences, but suffice it to say that one must know how to sanitize every type of human and animal ""spill"" imaginable.  

The majority of people do not understand the level of skill involved and the attention to detail that must be maintained. For example, the chemicals used in janitorial service are generally concentrates that must be mixed in strict proportions according to use.  Furthermore, to properly clean a single public restroom stall requires that all surfaces be cleared of gross dirt FIRST, and then sanitized afterward. 

And it is especially NOW when the work of cleaners and janitorial staff is extremely important.  I believe that these workers MUST be paid more and that they are just as important as the people who maintain the rest of the infrastructure."

There was a book a few years back that described how hiring housecleaning agencies work. I have never forgotten the description of one worker saying they used the same rag for cleaning the toilet to clean the sink, shower,etc. Thanks but not thanks! I’ll stay safe in my own home that I’ve cleaned myself! When I was teaching, at the end of every day, I would clean every desk and computer with Lysol wipes I bought myself. People thought I was crazy. But if I didn’t do it, no one would. Certainly not the one janitor who had too much work as it was.  Cleanliness may not be that close to Godliness but it sure helps!"

I did temp work at law firms for many years.  Not even at firms employing hundreds of people and doing a million dollars a month in billing was there ever hot water in the restrooms. Even if there had been, it would be no protection from the handful of women (often with with Ivy League law degrees) who were soooo busy they'd come out of the stall and dash straight out the door without washing their hands, sometimes holding and/or talking on their phone the whole time.

This says a lot about the dynamics of our country. Those who take on the risk of contracting COVID-19 are frontline, essential workers, who are mostly minorities and women. They’re saving others who have the benefit of staying safe at home, or arriving in public to a deeply cleaned space.  

In the fall, teachers will be asked to become the next category of those who this administration deems “expendable”.  It’s time for a reality check and a COVID-19 PLAN, because right now, America is truly failing it’s people."

As a country we are the laughing stock of the world. We have a President who from day one has not taken this seriously and now Americans and businesses are paying with their lives and family businesses being shut down. 

Even today, Trump continues to minimize and dismiss the magnitude of the pandemic. He refuses to mandate masks, he's encouraging schools and businesses to reopen without any regard to the dangers and again we're now seeing and living with the results.

To be honest, it's not just the pandemic that's threatening these businesses.  It's also the greed of landlords who think things will return to normal, and are reluctant to negotiate with their tenants.

Clearly, we now have a new normal and everyone needs to work together to preserve our valuable business enterprises.

It is the pandemic, yes, but also changing consumer habits, competition, and perhaps a bit of hubris.

2020-07-17 14:43:23,"It’s just a large scale result of Trump’s “business” practices. Before he was President, as a shady businessman, it’s well documented that he put countless small businesses out of business. He just did not pay their bills. He was known for it, especially in the tri-state area. He would leverage his inflated brand recognition to convince small companies to do work on spec or with payment terms that he inevitably wouldn’t honor, finding some fault with their work and refusing to pay after it was all complete. He was so lawyered up that it was difficult for these small businesses to go after him and win. Trump would rather throw money at his lawyers than pay an honest person his due. Some of these companies were started by a grandparent or earlier and had been a family business for generations. It was heartbreaking to hear about it. Now the whole country is paying the price for his mismanagement style. And the heartbreak continues. All in service to one giant ego. I still don’t understand how we’ve possibly come to this."

We are spending what we have and may have in the future so fast it’s like someone who flew to Las Vegas and played the slots for a week and ended up insolvent. The businesses lost and individuals who have lost jobs and savings are not going to resume normal life just like that. The Republicans seem to think that this is some kind of self regulating process instead of a ruinous national disaster and they are more interested in stock prices than what is going on in the real economy."

I am hoping that this comes out of the Corona Virus Crisis: a realization that continuing to revolve everything in this country around making as much money as possible is not a sustainable way to move forward for our families, our towns, for the soul of America. This crisis is an opportunity to ask ourselves: what do we really care about? What values do I want my work to manifest in the world?  For make no mistake: if we cannot figure out a way to pivot soon, the American experiment could go down in the history books as a failure."

Over half the stores are vacant, some have paper or wood over the windows, ""for lease"" signs on the buildings, some are just dusty and empty. Homeless people wandering or huddled in the doorways. I didn't live here in the eighties, my husband said the city looked like this then. In February every store was occupied, fancy restaurants lined these blocks, the shops sold exotic soaps and art. 

My 92-year-old mom predicted a crash, who knew a pandemic would cause it. I don't think our economy is going to spring back overnight, I'm sorry President Trump. The damage to our economy is far deeper than this horrendous pandemic. We could be looking at a depression where things worsen over time, our economy was overheated and a correction was overdue.

One of the biggest blunders from the start has been the inconsistent and mixed messages being heard and read from Trump, Pence and/or other members of the Trump administration.

There has never been any clear leadership or consistent direction from Trump.

My husband and I were in a very large camping/outdoor store in WI this morning.  On the outside entrance door, there was a large sign that listed the symptoms of COVID-19.  At the bottom of the sign, it stated that if you have any of those symptoms, do not enter the store.

But there were NO signs mandating the wearing of a face mask.  There was a greeter inside the store, welcoming customers, but wearing no mask.  NO ONE wore a mask but us.

How can you have one sign telling you to not enter if experiencing symptoms but no mandate for wearing a mask?  What about people who are asymptomatic?  How many people did the greeter encounter while not wearing ANY face protection?

We were in another WI store, very large grocery store, and they saw a sign that read ""Beginning Aug. 1, face masks will be mandatory.""  And I was told that sign was put up on July 1.  Why wait an entire month?

Once again, mixed signals, mixed messages, mixed direction.

Everywhere I have been, albeit in WI or IL, there is NO consistent message or adherence.  That should have began at the top, from Trump, NOT each state calling their own shots.  Is it any wonder why this virus is out of control?"

1.  What if the virus mutates and vaccines become ineffective?  The flu vaccinations given each year are reformulated to include the particular flu viruses that are prevalent. The possibility of COVID mutating by itself requires that we move as quickly as possible to stop the virus before it does mutate. 
2. What policies might allow us to open more quickly while still being safe?  Can we isolate or quarantine large groups so that with reasonable protections (distancing, masks, etc.) they can go back to work? Do we need Federal restrictions on travel?
3. What is the current status of the budget deficit? We know about stimulus and health expenditures, but how much will revenues decline?  We should be aware and concerned, although worrying about the deficit should be secondary to fighting the pandemic, stimulating the economy, and supporting social programs.  But we need to know where we are at, and will be, as it will affect the economy coming out of the pandemic.
4.  Who is coordinating Federal programs to make sure everything is covered and programs are managed as effectively as possible?  It seems there may be some small groups in the White House considering part of it, but not very effectively, and not transparently so the public is aware of the issues and options."

Ignoring all the information available, the doctors, health officials and scientists pleading to be heard and helped in order  to preserve a rosy outlook of the unfolding catastrophe were attempts at appeasing a horrific, self absorbed idiot who only wants to be reelected.

As the reality seeps in that schools will once again be closed or dangerous places to send children this Fall this has become personal for almost all of us.

Last night I heard a judge in Texas talk about 40 corona deaths this past week in her county alone. Two of the dead were cops. One county in Texas. Two dead cops in one week.

I'd like to know, New York Times, how many cops have been killed by this virus in the U.S.A. And, how many cops have been killed that would not have been had we had cohesive and sane leadership at the top. Model that one.

The net between those two are the number of cops that have been killed by the actions and in-actions of the President and his party. 

How many cops have been killed by anarchists in the past six months, and how many are dead because of the incompetent narcissist that resides in the white house. The cop killer."

Is it not time to charge him, arrest him, and take him to jail to await trial? For all those who claim a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, then get up off your butts and insist on declaring him unfit under Article 25 first.

From her demeanor and clearly political phrasing of things, I suspected Dr. Birx was part of the problem very early on after the Task Force was assembled.  She was just too ingratiating, and it got on my nerves that she and Dr. Fauci were increasingly not on the same page.

But this article has really opened my eyes to the true damage whe was able to do because of her praise of a president that destroys all who enter his orbit.  That she could be so wrong for so long with such devastating consequences was a real eye opener in this very thorough analysis.

Of course, the main problem, on the virus as with every challenge facing this nation, is the president and his mercurial management style.  He can't take bad news, which meant Dr. Birx tried never to give him any.

I suspect her career has been dealt a lethal blow."
2020-07-18 20:01:11,"The good Dr. Birx is a large part of the problem here. All roses and sunshine with an occasional finger wag as things spin out of control. Kisses the ring while the nation convulses. Didn't I read that a few days back she met with governors in some of the red, red hot virus states to assure them that it would be just fine to open the schools. Sullying her reputation and or is something in this for her? Does anyone have a lead on what motivates her? Seems like more than just putting up with a desperate situation to have a grown up in the room. She seems to be wittingly part of the spin machine."

2020-07-18 20:15:25,"These articles are just beating a dead horse. Anyone with any sense at all knows that Trump is no 'leader'. He is not a 'wartime president'. Expecting him to be is on you at this point. The longer you wait around, waiting for Trump to take some kind of decisive action, the longer we'll be in this mess. After watching other countries successfully battle this virus, you know what you have to do. So just do it."

Dr. Birx chose to serve the Trump administration instead of the United States of America. Her reputation will never recover."

In other words, Fat Nixon could care less about how many Californians die from COVID-19. What matters is whether or not the governor is willing to kiss his ring.

Sickening. HOW can Republicans - particularly those in Congress - continue to support this transparently unqualified, narcissistic homicide in the White House? It's equal parts surreal, absurd and criminal."
2020-07-18 19:37:37,"One thing is for certain, any task force that includes Jared Kushner is doomed to failure.  No one in this administration is more overrated than the clown prince.

It was clear to anyone watching the televised nonsense every day that Dr. Birx was intent on ingratiating herself with Trump with her simple messages and graph charts (oh, our President does love his graphs) and positive messaging.  Now she will forever be known as yet another one of his enablers.  Shame on her — she, of all the dimwits in those secret meetings, should have known better."
2020-07-18 19:45:33,"It is shocking just how integral Dr Birx has been to the disastrous state our country is in. Dr Birx has become a political operative, you would not believe that she is respected AIDS researcher and public health expert. She should resign, as she has led to the death of so many.

Together, Mr. Trump and Jared win the award for gross negligence and abject inactivity. They're the geniuses who ignored expert advice, preferring instead to rely on hope, fantasy, and prayer, instead. 

Yes prayer. Remember? We all saw Mr. Trump making some sort of murky statement with that bible in his hand?

2020-07-18 19:46:27,"An excellent piece that clarifies what we already knew or at the very least, suspected. The blatant incompetence of this administration is unparalleled. Dwarfing Dubbya's ham-handed response to Katrina. I'm convinced that politics has even more to do with the response to this virus than is mentioned here. It's certainly behind the push to re-open which has led to , dare I say, genocide."
2020-07-18 19:28:50,A whole of government failure under Trump’s “ leadership”.  Entirely predictable and entirely devastating.
2020-07-18 19:58:45,"In order to be a leader, you actually have to take responsibility for something other than just the good stuff. Drumpf doesn't take responsibility for anything that goes wrong, even if the is the one who planned it, such as the interview in the Rose Garden with Fox News where he asked ""Who's idea was this anyway?"" It was his idea. 
No responsibility when it matters, no real leadership. 
PERIOD!"
2020-07-18 19:38:04,"I knew it was all over for the US when Trump abdicated his responsibility concerning this virus by turning it over to the Governors of the states. Most of them then kicked the responsibility can down the road to the counties who sent it down to the cities and towns who threw up their own hands and said it was each individual's ""personal responsibility "" to do the right thing. No wonder other countries laugh at us. And it starts at the top. To solve any of this there is only one solution - change Management- at the top."

In my semi-rural community, despite a belated mask mandate from our governor, local businesses fail to enforce mask wearing, encouraged by local law enforcement who declared a non-enforcement policy. So national, state, and local fools are in control of my elder household’s wellbeing - and, surprise, the recent “unpublished” White House report stated my town was in the top 15 most dangerous red zones in Texas. I’m angry, trapped at home in a failed reopening."

Just like anyone who has been associated with the Trump Administration, Dr. Birx has met her fate. Trump is the ultimate virus and there is no vaccine, no cure. The only effective preventive measure is social and physical distancing. Don't go near him or his Administration. Your reputation will suffer or be destroyed.
As for Trump's lack of empathy, I distinctly remember Larry King, on his CNN show, asking Trump, many years ago, ""What do you do when there is genocide committed by one group against another and 400,000 people are murdered?"" Trump's answer was, ""You just don't think about it."" I have been unable to locate this video clip. Does anyone have a source at CNN to track this down?"
2020-07-18 20:16:43,"No president nor mayor, general nor lieutenant chooses their crisis; it is foisted upon them by events. The question is, how does one in a leadership role rise to the challenges associated with their crisis. Abject failure is not leading at all; routine failure is not leading from the front. Working to shift blame to others is deserting ones duties in total, simply revealing a hollow shell of a leader. Donald J. Trump is an abject failure in every measure. If in the military he would have been court-martialed if not fragged."

Had the feds followed what Italy or NY/NJ did this fall there would be schools, not 40m unemployed. I live in NYC, we have not been allowed inside a bar/restaurant or store in almost 4 months, restaurants will still not be open for indoor dining. Masks have been mandatory since early April. Guess what, we do look like Italy! Our governor, Cuomo, does not letup. He is still badgering ppl daily to keep social distance and wear masks, It works. We don’t want to be Florida."

And then, presto- we were pitted against each other- follow trump or science, you can't do both.

Of all the horrible things trump has done during his nightmare time in office, urging Americans to turn on each other during the greatest health and economic crisis in one hundred years will live in infamy."
2020-07-18 20:11:11,"The Washington Post is reporting that the Trump administration wants to remove funding for testing and contact tracing from the Senate's next COVID relief bill. The White House also wants to eliminate additional funding for the CDC and funds for the military to deal with the virus at home and abroad. This is simply incomprehensible. If the White House's goal is to kill as many Americans as possible this is a good strategy. Of course, their real goal is to protect the president's fragile ego since he thinks testing makes him look bad."

The pandemic did not just go away,  but this gang should."
2020-07-18 19:28:47,"“Mr. Trump went, in a matter of days, from proclaiming that he alone had the authority to decide when the economy would reopen to pushing that responsibility onto the states.”

My feeling at the time was that once Trump realized that, indeed, he didn’t have the power to decide when the states would reopen, he allowed his anger to drive him to abandon all pretense of involvement in fighting the virus. In fact, he turned to stoking as much partisan anger over the pandemic as possible.

Yes, navigating the rapids of our United States can be tricky.  And the petty man we elected to be the most powerful person in the world just isn’t up to the job."
2020-07-18 19:37:19,"In addition to shifting blame to the states and forcing them to find their own testing and PPE, the Trump administration also stole what they found.  For example, Colorado Governor Democrat Jared Polis found 300 ventilators, but they were confiscated by FEMA before they arrived.  Trump then ""donated"" 100 back and gave Republican Senator Cory Garderner (who's facing a tough reelection challenge).

But it was nonpartisan theft.  Maryland Governor Republican Larry Hogan secured 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea.  To protect them from FEMA, Hogan chartered a jet, which was met by armed guards from the MD State Patrol and National Guard, who then stayed with the tests until they were distributed to MD hospitals and testing centers.

Pushing responsibilities onto states is bad enough, but stealing what they found is a whole new level of corruption."
2020-07-18 19:48:08,"Mark Meadow’s effort to place blame on the states rather on DJT made a horrible situation worse. States bidding against each other for critical supplies and equipment, the rush to try unproven drugs touted by the president, little testing and long waits for results, disinformation, increasing deaths and a sense of overwhelming hopelessness.

No leadership from DJT and his administration, no coordination, no plan. Different emphasis by the governors: some Trump ideologues refusing to acknowledge the problem despite  the warnings, poor data collection and little preparation by many red states. No masks, no social distancing, fast reopening, open beaches and bars, emphasis on opening schools,little belief in science, and “ every state for itself.”

Complete chaos while the president stews, defends confederate flags and monuments, calls out the Feds in Portland, ignores Putin’s bounties on American troops, promotes Goya,tweets and golfs.

A complete abnegation of duty. Meanwhile democracy ebbs, the citizenry weeps, our international reputation disappears, and desperation reigns.


Meanwhile, Meadows, Navarro,, Trump et al continue to blame for their own ineptitude."
2020-07-18 20:01:26,"In United States law, depraved-heart murder, also known as depraved-indifference murder, is a type of murder where an individual acts with a ""depraved indifference"" to human life and where such act results in a death, despite that individual not explicitly intending to kill. 

In a depraved-heart murder, defendants commit an act even though they know their act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to a person. If the risk of death or bodily harm is great enough, ignoring it demonstrates a ""depraved indifference"" to human life and the resulting death is considered to have been committed with malice aforethought. 

In some states, depraved-heart killings constitute second-degree murder, while in others, the act would be charged with varying degrees of manslaughter or third-degree murder."
2020-07-18 20:06:12,"In the book 'And the Band Played On,' Randy Shilts made the comparison between the federal government's response to the 1982 Tylenol murders and its lack of response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Shilts wrote, ""Federal, state, and local officials were immediately on hand to coordinate efforts thousands of miles away from where the tampered boxes appeared. No action was too extreme and no expense too great, they insisted, to save lives"" and that ""Within five weeks...new regulations on tamper-resistant packaging"" were issued.
 Seven people were killed by poisoned Tylenol, but hundreds were dead of AIDS.  Shilts suggests the reason for this is that the victims of AIDS were largely marginalized gay men, therefore there was no political will in the Reagan administration to protect them as there was will to protect random Americans whom Reagan believed had more value.  If AIDS at the beginning had been leading to the hospitalization and deaths of hundreds of straight people, Shilts implies, of course the government would devote limitless resources to stop it.  
 Almost 40 years later, another GOP administration proves Shilts' hypothesis wrong.  Trump's administration can't even bother to put on a semblance of caring for human life.  Trump can't even play lip service to the idea that people other than himself might be suffering, and would rather cut resources to help end this pandemic than increase them. They won't help us because they don't want to.

2020-07-18 19:36:54,"The truly sad part of this story is that nothing has changed in the president's actions, attitude and predictions. As recently as  July 7, Trump was predicting in an interview with Greta Van Sutern, the nation ""would be in very good shape in two, three or four weeks.""  Both before and after the interview, the number of infections has done nothing other than continue to skyrocket. 

If we believe this pandemic is top-of-mind with the president, we are wrong. On Thursday, in prepared remarks (not ad lib), Trump spoke of low-flow shower faucets, the merits of incandescent light bulbs, dishwasher performance and his personal appearance as a result of shampooing. Earlier in the week, he warned us that suburbs and windows would disappear if Joe Biden were elected.  

If this article is correct in that Trump made the decision to move on from the pandemic in mid-April, it is clear today he has never returned. 

We're on our own, everyone."

2020-07-18 19:48:37,"The pandemic handed Trump a reelection guarantee; the success of a wartime president. George H W Bush's approval rating jumped 40% with the first Gulf War and George W's jumped 35% with the second. This was an easy war to win. In addition to early examples from several countries on how to beat back the virus, there are over a dozen models from US universities that gave accurate predictions of the path of the virus. This is a war that even a mediocre president could have won, but not one surrounded by yes-men and toadies."
2020-07-18 19:51:07,"Trump's response of slowing down testing (to make him look good), having a Democratic governor beg for and publicly thank him for supplies (to make him look good), and constantly referring to the 'Chinese virus (again, to make him look better) is utterly despicable.  Now Kellyanne Conway believes there should be more Covid press conferences, if only to help Trump's polling numbers.
Never mind about doing something for the good of the country,  it is all about how it helps Trump.  His niece is correct, he needs to resign."

So I followed Google, CDC, WHO on a daily basis.  Here is my question:  Is noone in the White House capable of researching something?  No one in the West Wing who can't follow what isn't working is many countries--and the few things that   are working in a new contagion crisis?  It is not rocket science, and the health of so many people was at risk.  I just don't understand why NOONE cared about public health in a crisis of this sort--even an amateur researcher who could have contacted the people in China already filing reports.

This is not to critique Drs Birz and Fauci, but they are not the only people in the universe.  Anyone with Google can read up on this.

Too bad this nation is now addicted to a site I don't follow:  Twitter."
2020-07-18 19:49:46,It is truly horrifying how Trump’s disparagement of science has wrought such destruction to our country.  And unfortunately the end is not yet in sight.  I can only hope that we will have a new President come November.

When Trump saw all the press coverage Pence was receiving he decided to get back out in front, but not to lead the country.  No, from the start is was up to the states to procure supplies (and get into bidding wars, eventually even hiding shipments from overseas from the Feds, etc.)."
2020-07-18 19:56:21,Trump's goals from the start were aimed at preventing damage to his re-election chances. He has been transparent about looking at for Old Number One from the inception of this pandemic.

Chances of him being apprehended and prosecuted are slim and the injustice, considering lives sickened, lost, families forever fractured, is monumental.  It's like reading about a massive war crime.  Yet the outrage is beyond my comprehension.  It is split  by Party affiliation.  One side condemns what's happened and the other supports the perpetrator.

I am struggling to think of another comparable (or even greater) failure of presidential leadership - and not just in generations, but since the country's founding.

Certainly the Vietnam and Iraq debacles manifest failures in leadership,  But in those cases, the leadership was not AWOL - it was, instead, ""merely"" misguided and wrong.

In this case, it is not just poor judgment and decision making that is at play,   It is refusal to lead for the public good - to do one's duty. It is utter abandonment and malfeasance."
2020-07-18 19:44:53,"Because he had no business being president. He has no idea how to lead under normal circumstances, let alone a pandemic, and moreover he doesn’t WANT to lead, never has. He believes “delegating” is fair (and certainly takes the pressure of performance off), but the entire point of the position of the president is to have someone who CAN lead, take charge, and make the BEST decisions in a crisis. Yet this “president” chose to be absent and partisan."
2020-07-18 20:17:16,"Few people in this world are less qualified than Trump to deal with a pandemic.

There are millions who are qualified, but Trump is not one of them. No matter how hard the Oval Office or Congressional Republicans try to hide that fact."
2020-07-18 19:31:44,"As a data analytics professional, I have examined the models provided by the University of Washington IHME, and I regard them as really good work.  The modeling is sound.  However, anyone who works with statistical models acquires a baked-in universal caveat:  models project the range of future values based on past behaviors.  They assume system inertia.  Fail this premise, and the model projections are going to be valueless.  Dr. Birx really ought to have known that.  I am astonished to read about her naive adoption of model-based predictions.  When asked, one _always_ expresses the prediction as : ""given model assumptions A, B and C, and assuming stable system dynamics, and assuming the sample data are clean, then we can fit the model parameters within error X, and project outcomes Y with confidence Z.""  It's a highly contingent statement.  One does not go around saying: everything is going to be fine because some specific model currently projects a downward trend.   The model may need elaboration, the sample data may be faulty, and the system behavior may change.  Trump's totally irresponsible advocacy of quick reopening and rejection of mask mandates changed the underlying system behavior.  Of course the projections were wrong.  Go back and review the current IHME projections, and you'll now see a pretty grim picture.  A virus simply spreads according to transmissibility and the density of contacts.  You don't need a model to understand that.  Dr. Fauci understands that."

There is a backlog for test results, people scoff at mask wearing and the number of cases and deaths rise. We need federal leadership to get control of this. We need more testing. We need a national mask mandate. But nothing will happen while the president ignores the science, refuses to wear a mask and focuses on his election campaign. Thank you for this excellent reporting.

When a candidate tells us “I alone can solve this problem,” disqualify him/her."
2020-07-18 19:34:16,Another well researched article detailing in excruciating detail the failings of the Administration. I often wonder how many of the legions of folks who call it a hoax and still refuse to follow not only recommendations but Government mandates would be that way if they didn’t hear it from the White House and many of their Governors.

If this one simple and yes difficult change of  human behavior occurred from the top, and that points to Trump, then maybe this country would have had a chance of seeing this end.  But that did not happen.  I agree with Mr. Suarez,  “people follow the leaders who are supposed to be leaders”.   Harry Truman must be rolling in his grave right now."
2020-07-18 19:43:38,"It started well before mid April. Trump called it a hoax when there were only a few reported cases early on, and there were repeated continued denials all along.

No, they are not protected by the 1st amendment.  No, by protecting them from the shaming that's needed you are not protecting journalism.  They are spreading blatant lies that endanger the country.

2020-07-18 20:23:03,"Typical Trump and just the tip of the iceberg to the devastation he has been building into his oxymoronic MAGA policies.

Americans should be angry to the extreme, Trumps response to coronavirus and self praise for that response (failure he cannot admit) bears witness to the lies behind all his cognitive responses and measures to his self proclamation to Make American Great Again.


Americans naturally do not want to diminish the office of the President, but Trump has achieved that effortlessly. It was never about America, it was always about Trump. He has never displayed qualities nor abilities to be anything but Trump, no one should be surprised except those who hang their intelligence on the Real Fake News."
2020-07-18 20:27:00,"COVID19 is not only Trump's legacy but also the GOP's. Quite frankly, it is more the latter's when the GOP went extreme in the W's Karl Rove era by marrying plutocracy with social reactionism. W had a chance to right the ship with the good will from 911 except he gave Cheney a free reign to go neocon. With dropping the ball, America had the Great Recession, then an unmitigated disaster even after Katrina.

Then McConnell, Ryan, Cantor et al chose to plot against President Obama instead of helping him to stabilize global problem and thus having us a thieving Trump. 

Even now, COVID money is siphoning off to Trump family and GOP associates. If America doesn't wake up in Nov 3, 2020, she is dooming herself. And like 911, and Katrina before it, this SARSCoV2 pandemic may very well be a prelude of something worse"
2020-07-18 20:29:18,"In 2016 I asked if Trump voters would also fly in an airplane piloted by a novice or operated by a smart guy off the street. 

Now it boggles the mind that this buffoon gets even 5% support. 

Like living in madman’s dream."
2020-07-18 20:38:33,"Terrific piece.  Horrifying incompetence on so many levels.  How *anyone* could read this article and conclude 'yeah, I want four more years of this' is beyond me."
2020-07-18 20:38:36,"Up until this year, Donald Trump did a terrible job but at least he wasn't responsible for the death of Americans by getting us into an unnecessary war.  Now he's responsible for tens of thousands of American deaths over and above those that would have died no matter who was President.  It took him 3 ½ years to unequivocally achieve the title of ""Worst President Ever""."
2020-07-18 20:30:55,"Great journalism!

No surprise here: Decisions made by incompetents, sycophants, and lightweights.  Not even bright enough to know they were in over their heads.

They always regarded the virus as simply public relations and political problems - not a public health problem.

(Thanks to the authors for including the quote from “spokesman” Judd Deere; his satire is always appreciated.)"
2020-07-18 20:31:18,Like so much of what we hear about Trump nothing in this article is the least bit surprising.
2020-07-18 20:34:28,You just knew that Dr. Birx was complicit in Trump's world when she sat in the press briefing when Trump said to look into injecting disinfectant to stop the virus.  She did not stand up and go to the microphone and stop the nonsense right then and there.  She had a responsibility and the opportunity to do so.  And she did nothing.
2020-07-18 20:25:05,"April?  It was barely mid-March when America heard from its ""President"" the words that will live in infamy: ""I don't take responsibility at all."""
2020-07-18 20:27:01,"My best argument for Hillary, the technocrat, was that she could keep the wheels on.  And Trump?  Almost assured to have the axles up on four concrete blocks, sitting on the curb, third world style, kind of like Venezuela.  What Trump would do in meeting a real crisis was too predictable.  Wheels matter."
2020-07-18 20:33:04,"So.  For the pandemic, shift responsibility to the states.
But for protests, first in DC now Portland, send in the Federal Marshall’s.  Never mind Federalism.  Let Trump and Barr decide what is good for the states.
Worse than Putin sending unmarked tanks into Ukraine.  We expect it from Putin.
Are we going to accept it from Trump, Barr et al?"
2020-07-18 20:37:53,"Sad that we have a President that entered the Oval Office with no prior political experience, no proven leadership ability and an ego bigger then ever imagined, .  Obvious is that if three states that were originally the epicenter of the Covid-19 virus could get things right then why didn't the rest of the country follow suit.  The President did not want to concede that he was not responsible for that feat.  When able to turn things around and use New York, New Jersey and Connecticut as examples of how the rest of the country should proceed  he turned and led the country in the opposite direction.  Sad is that many paid careful attention to the poor judgment coming from the Oval Office.
This was by far the worst possible attempt to make this country great again.  Event more unfortunate was the way in which the President handled  other major issues which  occurred at the same time.
Thank you New York Times for publishing this great story."
2020-07-18 20:23:34,"To me the last statement is the most pertinent: “People follow leaders,” he said, before rephrasing his remarks. “People follow the people who are supposed to be leaders.” Trump and his band of incompetent enablers are certainly not leaders, far from it. Trump couldn’t even manage finding his way out of a paper bag if he had too. And Dr. Birx, don’t get me started on her level of incompetence. First the disinfectant fiasco where she sits by silently while Trump promotes injecting disinfectant, and then to be a so called “data person” and not be able to interpret trends that were readily apparent to real data researchers. It’s more than time to show all these people to the exits.

Besides the unfortunate human tragedy resulting from this pandemic, which in no way can/should be minimized, it’s clear that Trump and all his enablers don’t care at all about the people afflicted by the virus nor the country as a whole. Their perspective is always focused around themselves, their image, how they’re being perceived and their re-election chances. Never does it seem to dawn on these people that they’re supposed to be doing the job of protecting and leading the people of this country out of this crisis. They all want to play the leadership role, but are completely incompetent. They’re all clueless, a truly sad situation."
2020-07-18 20:25:49,"Great article.
Sadly with just over 100 days until the election, I fear America’s memory of the COVID-19 summer will fade and this clown and his cast of sycophants will be back in office with no checks or balances. That is a nightmare scenario that keeps me awake at night."
2020-07-18 20:32:38,"After the election there should be a special tribunal to identify, charge, try and punish those in Trump's administration who criminally lied to and misled the American people about the pandemic and caused the deaths of so many Americans.

I mean, really, we are going to let these people's deaths go unavenged?"
2020-07-18 20:34:05,"The roots of Trump’s failure on COVID-19 go back not to April, but to December, 2019, when Trump learned about the virus and did nothing. In December he should have started procuring PPE for our health care workers, and for the citizens of the United States. Instead, because there were not enough masks for all of us, he had to have his surgeon general and Dr. Fauci tell us that masks we’re not helpful, leaving us with muddled messaging that still plagues us. In December he should have been working with health officials across the country to put a plan in place. But he didn’t. In December he should have spoken to the nation to tell us what the plan was, and how we would meet each goal within it. But he’s just a malevolent imbecile, so here we are."
2020-07-18 20:40:18,"Left out of the article was the intense pressure the White House was under from right wing media.  There were nonstop demands from Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Rush Limbaugh and a host of other conservative opinion makers to start up the economy.  The lockdown became politicized.  A refusal to wear masks was a badge of honor - a sign that you weren't a weak, fearful sheeple.  Small business owners and large corporations were threatening an economic disaster if the nation didn't return to normal immediately.  Republican governors were insisting their state was different from NY or NJ, and could handle a reopening of the economy.

Trump has always gotten his policy directions from Fox News and other conservative media stars, so even if Dr. Birx had sided with Dr. Fauci and demanded a continued lockdown, it wouldn't have made any difference.   The current resurgence in the virus was cooked up by the conservative propaganda network, where Trump has his real home, not the Oval Office."
2020-07-18 20:40:20,"Superb summary of events and the facts we know to this time. So much more will come out but just this much brings a sense of disgust and repulsion toward anything Trump -- family, felonious friends, Putin and the GRU, Trump's administration and all Republicans -- but for Romney."
2020-07-18 20:21:19,"This is superb reporting, and yet it simply reinforces what has been quite plain for months:  this 'administration' is breathtakingly incompetent, pathologically unable to acknowledge the truth or to admit failure, and utterly heedless of the profound human and economic cost of our pandemic response.  The sharp rise in the incidence of cases across the past three weeks, notably in the sections of the country where equally incompetent, deluded and heartless leaders have followed an almost suicidal path back to 'normal' does not yet seem to have jolted 30-35% of the country out of its pact with a death cult.  What will it take?  A quarter million deaths by election day?  A half million deaths by Christmas?"
2020-07-18 20:28:47,A disaster of historic proportions is unfolding south of our border and we can do nothing but watch in horror. A gross lack of leadership has combined with a gross lack of community spirit. America the basket case - how tragic.
2020-07-18 20:31:47,The administration hasn't made America great again. They've made us an embarrassment to the rest of the world. I'm so tired of the lying and the dying that results. How we get out of this if we don't remove them from office in November is beyond me.
2020-07-18 20:35:02,"This is great reporting.  Deborah Birx tried to please Trump instead of what was in the best interests of saving lives in our nation.  The Trump administration's response has been shameful, intentional and negligent.  So many thousands of lives could have been saved with more competent leadership..."
2020-07-18 20:23:26,"The task-force exercise in 'group think' conducted by amateurs who ignored experts, and the clear example of other countries dealing far more capably with the Coronavirus, has cost the lives of tens of thousands of our people. I don't know how those involved can look themselves in the mirror, I really don't. If they were in any way decent or upstanding they would, starting with Dr. Birx, have resigned in disgrace weeks ago. Failure on such a scale cannot be tolerated--not this degree of murderous incompetence. Where are our elected representatives? Why are they not howling about this from the street corners? There really and truly do have to be consequences for killing this many Americans. Even if those responsible have no qualms when facing themselves in a mirror, it seems to me only fair that they do it from within a prison cell. It is simply not possible that willfully putting millions of Americans in harms way from a deadly disease does not constitute a very grave crime. If it isn't a crime against humanity, what is?"
2020-07-18 20:38:13,"Fantastic. Everyone here agrees.  One big happy agreeable choir.

Means nothing, if we don't motivate an historic turnout and then be prepared for battle should Trump lose, or squeak by in some underhanded way. Four more years of him would make this country unrecognizable.  Vote."
2020-07-18 20:35:26,"Had Trump not had the virus to deal with the economy may have given him a real chance to win again. The heretofore unimaginable catastrophe of his mangling any kind of response has certainly destroyed all hope for him now. The real irony is that had he and his administration leveraged the problems faced by China and Europe with the time available to put together a cogent and powerful response to head it off here in the US, we may have had far less illnesses and death as well as a mitigated impact on the economy which would have set him up as a hero just as we headed into the election. Personally as horrible the virus is I think Trump being president for another 4 years would have destroyed the republic forever."
2020-07-18 20:31:02,"The saddest thing of all is that he and his will be entirely unaffected. It's the families who have lost loved ones, the people whose jobs are gone, whose businesses are destroyed who will suffer. 

And this man doesn't care. He only cares for himself."

2020-07-18 20:42:31,"Dr. Brix always seemed to play to Trump's biases. In her profession, you always prepare for the worst case scenario, especially with a new, unpredictable, deadly virus.

I wonder if she's launched the research on injecting disinfectants yet."
2020-07-18 20:21:06,"i denegrate both dr. birx and dr. redfield (CDC) for not standing up for science and standing shoulder to shoulder with dr. fauci, whom they left twisting in the wind by their cowardice as health authorities. 

the scene of dr. redfield grinning affirmatively as trump announced ""everyone who wants a test will get a test"" at the CDC, when redfield knew perfectly well that was a lie, is painful.

the scene of dr. birx studying her knees while trump, standing  not ten feet away, ranted his delirium about injecting cleaning fluids and using UV light, is also painful. 

it is painful to see craven, careerist collusion and dissimulation in scientists. even bureaucrat scientists.

dr. birx may have worked all night to ""get the numbers right"" in her attempt to appear to be doing the professional thing, but she caved to political pressure, she refused to make clear what the science says, and she and redfield share the blame for the fiasco.

oh, and kudos to dr. redfield for the CDC test kit failue. they didn't even stop to do a quality check before rushing it to the field. that's real leadership there, bobby."

2020-07-18 20:25:04,"The failure to effectively respond to the coronavirus pandemic is not only due to the weapons grade ineptitude of Trump and his advisers. We have a sizable minority in this country who follow Ronald Reagan’s belief that government is the problem and elect representatives who feel likewise. Consequently, these “leaders” obstruct government actions/programs which prevents effective solutions from being enacted. We can’t expect well thought out policies from elected representatives who are anti-government."

2020-07-18 20:20:37,"If Mr. Trump is looking for someone to blame on the current virus and economic situation - he should look in a mirror.  It is now clear why he had the number of bankruptcies that he did over the years. 

And despite the rosy numbers coming from Arizona lately, we are far from being out of the woods - health wise or economically."
2020-07-18 20:34:37,This crisis has shown Trump’s fundamental lack of understanding about executive leadership.  Executive leadership requires input from many points of view to use as the basis for a comprehensive strategy crafted by the executive and their core team.  It is not blindly following one person at a time down the rabbit hole.  The buck doesn’t stop with Drs. Birx or Fauci or Vice President Pence or the governors.  It stops with President Trump.
2020-07-18 20:38:42,"This is the reckoning, right?  Here it is, the point where the magical thinking, anti intellectual part of America finally collides with reality, and it’s not pretty. Liberals in general respect science and expertise over superstition, opinion and gut feelings, but sadly because of partisanship the more conservative members of society rallied against it, not because science was wrong, but because liberals support it, so they have backed themselves into a corner of their own making.  If liberals are right about the virus, what else are they right about? Climate Change, God?   So a worldview is on the line, whole generations of belief now challenged, and anger and resentment is the result, it doesn’t have to be that way.  Embrace the light of reason, critical thinking, science, evidence, we all need to move forward together, united and face our difficulties together."

2020-07-18 20:35:59,"The moment I set eyes on Dr Birx, I began to suspect that matters would turn out like they have. Undoubtedly smart she is, well qualified, very experienced (although not directly with a virus like Covid), well published, well travelled, well connected..

But Dr Birx is absolutely a product of the establishment - most particularly the political and military establishment and, has been so for decades.

Politicians and the upper echelons of the military, everywhere, have a somewhat nuanced relationship with facts and the unvarnished truth.

Dr Fauci's pedigree is not the same."
2020-07-18 20:37:28,"There are many reasons a comparison with Australia is misleading - a smaller population, the virus hit our shores later, many fewer points of entry and so no. But there is also much in common - a federal system, an advanced democracy and high level of expertise. Here there is a sense of profound shock and disbelief with the unfolding catastrophe in the US. Many of us have friends and family in the US and most Australians share a deep affection and admiration for the US as our 'great and powerful' friend - an ally in every conflict and a steadfast, if equally flawed,  upholder of justice, the rule of law and the international order. The social and political divisions laid bare by this crisis in the US, the hostility to science and fact and the apparent willingness of the national leadership to surrender in the face of an existential crisis are, from this far-distant and outside view, deeply, deeply troubling. The world is a much poorer, more dangerous and darker place without American leadership - and it is unimaginable without American belief that any challenge can be overcome. We hope, we pray, we long for that America to return to us"
2020-07-18 20:37:56,THis article was too lenient on Dr. Birx. Dr. Birx has become more of a politician than she is a doctor. She's known Dr. Fauci for quite some time and knows that he doesn't exaggerate for the sake of publicity. She can read the statistics as well as anyone else and knows that Trump has no idea what he's doing other than opening the economy for his reelection purposes. She bears as much responsibility for the increase in this pandemic as Trump as she could have stood up and said that Dr. Fauci is correct and that we should believe in the numbers coming out of the CDC and wear masks in every state. I'm afraid that time has passed to be proactive and we just have to ride this out the best we can.
2020-07-18 20:23:39,"Thank you, NYT reporters, for this carefully researched article detailing the timeline of the failures of the Trump administration to lead the nation out of this catastrophe. From the start, they have treated this as an economic, not a medical problem, and have let politicians (I now include Dr Birx among them) run the response, and this is what we get.  Thanks to this total failure of leadership by Trump and his enablers at all levels, people still ignore masking rules, and I still have to convince some of my own patients that Covid19 isn't a hoax, and that most of the deaths aren't from ""something else.""  This winter could be a disaster, with Covid19 still rampant and influenza as well.  Please, please get your flu vaccines this fall, everybody!  It's your civic duty, even if our government won't say it."
2020-07-18 20:44:04,"A case of the blind leading the blind. Dr. Birx’s approach to the pandemic fed perfectly into what Donald Trump wanted to do, shirk his responsibilities as President to protect the American people and push responsibility to the governors. The great nightmare we had when this man became President revolved around how he would manage a crisis. Sadly we have found out. Perhaps the worst response in our history."
2020-07-18 20:25:16,A view from outside the US:  the response to the pandemic has demonstrated a failure of leadership at the highest level.  Couple this to governors who have eschewed science - and we see failure in leadership across many levels. America’s lustre has been dulled irreparably. It’s like watching the implosion of a once-mighty institution in slow motion. We are all the poorer for it.
2020-07-18 20:29:37,"The real logic is revealing;
1. They want to ignore the virus because it interferes with the economy and therefore the election 
2. They tried to ignore the virus till they realised they couldn’t any more and decided to try and get it over with 
3. Almost immediately they began to chafe 
4. They then lost patience and decided they could ignore it again
5. Now they realise it’s disastrous so they are trying to ignore it and manage it simultaneously by taking half measures.

So mask mandate/shutdown=admitting to the bubble they wrecked wrong and it’s actually incredibly serious, which makes the deaths their fault, and also means conceding there is no economic return to normal before the election. 
That’s the problem with masks - it would symbolise that there was a massive failure, it’s their fault and they won’t be able to fight the election pretending things are normal and the economy is back to the giddy heights of sub 2% growth."
2020-07-18 20:38:59,"Weekly unemployment claims made clear the economy was cratering and polling was showing his campaign bleeding support. Republican governors were agitating to lift the lockdown and the conservative political machinery was mobilizing to oppose what it saw as constraints on individual freedom.

Our republican governor was doing no such thing.  Neither was DeWine or Hogan.  Their states benefitted from these governors daring to oppose Trump and do the fact based decisions about when and how to reopen.  Massachusetts is still just starting phase 3 and cautiously watching the numbers.  Many here wear masks and hopefully that will prevent a slide backwards to Phase 2."
2020-07-18 20:39:12,"Unfortunately, patriotism has two definitions in America.  The first is doing things that are for the good of the country as a whole.  The other definition is the those that believe their rights are trampled on when the governments asks you to stay home, wear a mask if you have to go out and distance yourself.  

Italy and other countries have appeared to have followed the former, while enough Americans believe in the latter that we are still dealing with COVID-19 and not thinking of the longer term consequences."
2020-07-18 20:47:40,"I live next door to Vermont and the Republican Governor Phil Scott has done an excellent job dealing with the pandemic. From the beginning when he started closing down the state he said it was on him and he was going to do what he felt was right for the state regardless of how it would affect his upcoming reelection bid. He has been very eager to increase industry and jobs here but not if it puts his fellow Vermonters at risk. He has been having radio reports several times each week were he and various experts in their fields give updates on the current situation and then take questions from various news outlets for hours each time. The questions come from different parts of the political spectrum and he deals with them all in a respectful and rational manner. Listening to these broadcasts is hearing the way a democracy should be run. 
He cares about his fellow citizens and is willing to do the hard work for the task at hand.
I really wish someone like him were president right now."

2020-07-18 21:01:22,"It become obvious to this layperson early on that ""bending the curve"" of cases & deaths would depend on the oft-repeated pandemic health habits PLUS aggressive testing, tracing and quarantining by some public health entities. I never believed for a moment that the latter would happen in the US, with the possible exception of states in the Northeast which got an early wakeup call from the greater NYC area.

If Dr. Birx ever believed that testing/tracing/quarantining are essential to managing societal disruption, there's no evidence in this reporting that she ever advocated for it. All indications are she was, instead, an optimistic yes-man. Which suited Trump, Kushner and Meadows just fine.

Fast forward to today: at the rate at which cases and deaths are doubling in the SE and W, what's to prevent a million deaths--and many, many hospital critical care systems being shattered--over the next six to twelve months?

This is a calamity of biblical proportions. Thank you for revealing whom we need to thank."
2020-07-18 20:45:06,"Stunning article.  This is what the Times does best.  In retrospect, it’s clear that if Trump and his advisors had listened to scientists and doctors from the start, our country could have avoided so much illness and death.  I also believe that if he had worn and championed masks from the beginning, far more people would have done so and he would be seen by as their hero.  

Our response to the virus will be seen as one of our country’s darkest hours."
2020-07-18 20:46:50,"""At one stage, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California was told that if he wanted the federal government to help obtain the swabs needed to test for the virus, he would have to ask Mr. Trump himself — and thank him.""

Of the many revealing sentences written in this article, I found this one most revealing and most appalling. No country calling itself a democracy can have a top elected official who makes such demands in the middle of a public health emergency. 

I can't help but guess that when a devastating earthquake struck the Central Asian city of Ashgabat in October 1948--then located in the Soviet Union, now located in Turkmenistan--the local officials there were similarly forced to grovel and beg and thank Stalin personally for assistance that came from Moscow."

2020-07-18 20:53:21,"In an election year, this very detailed article is a primer on ineffective leadership.  Trump, through ignorance, incompetence, and disinterest, is running away from his role as the leader of the American people.  Mark Meadows has simply brought his duplicitous and attacking style from  Congress to the White House.  Finally, Dr. Brix has abdicated her Hippocratic Oath, to do no harm, to secure her standing in Trump's sycophantic inner circle.  This is what real journalism looks like.  The objective exposure of the abject failure of leadership by the Trump Administration in their response to our most pressing health crisis in moder history.  Thank you to each of the contributing journalists."

A result of a leadership void...

Most people freak out when they are at the worst stage and run to take action. Only someone demented would take the opportunity to tune it out at that point. 

That screams to me that Trump was terrified. He still is. He has no idea what to do. He is grasping at straws and doing whatever he can to stir up dust as if he's doing something. All he's doing is taking actions like objecting to allocating more money for testing, moving huge portraits and Clinton and Bush, retweeting like crazy and in an almost concerted effort, deliberately doing anything to help control this catastrophe."

And Republicans, goaded by trump from the sidelines, will savage Biden if he doesn’t solve all our problems within his first 100 days. The only thing that gives me hope is my conviction that Biden will surround himself with wise counselors to whom he will listen. “I alone can fix it” is long past its sell date. “It takes a village” needs to take its place."

It fit with his agenda to blame a foreign government and to try and bring Americans home and throw immigrants out. All of this is working according to plan. Human failings like Dr. Birx, who should have known better, and political monsters like Kushner and Pence, all play into the narrative. Trump’s one aim is to get re-elected. He will sanction and encourage the deaths of his opponents, the covert help from enemy dictatorships, blaming governors, cutting off healthcare, forcing the opening of dangerous businesses and institutions, closing off access to voting, and sending out rogue agents to kidnap citizens off the streets in order to achieve that singular goal."

Trump should immediately be removed from office pursuant to the terms of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution by his cabinet. As this is unlikely, Speaker Pelosi should initiate legislation, again pursuant to the 25th Amendment, to appoint a group of people to determine the President's ability to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the office. I for one am convinced he is mentally incapable and cannot.

Trump still has almost 6 months left on his term of office.  The COVID crisis dictates we cannot wait, not with almost 140,000 deaths already and more coming. When Obamacare was being considered, the Republicans raised false attacks saying it would create death panels.  It was a lie but the Republicans have created death panels - in the White House.

Legislation to sideline Trump might not pass the Senate, but if not, should be made a major issue in the November elections."

2020-07-18 20:51:34,"Thank you for the review of White House ""efforts.""

It is now July 18, and we are starting to see a significant increase in deaths.  For about the past 10 days the numbers have been in the range of 1000 deaths per day (997 on July 7, 946 on July 17, lower on the weekend).

On June 22, I posted the following:
Looking at the graph showing the 7 day moving average, an ""eyeball"" estimate of the slope (the rate of increase for non-techies) seems to me to be comparable to the slope at the beginning of the upsurge in mid-March, but it is starting at a much higher absolute value (20,000+ cases a day vs. close to zero cases a day). 
...
However, if the slope does increase to anything approaching that in the mid-March to April time frame, the absolute numbers are going to be ""ugly,"" very ugly and very large. Try ""out of control"" large.

""Opening up business"" has the strong possibility that people will be present in much higher density than when they are sheltering at home, and many states seem quite lax on mandating the use of face masks and social distancing.

I hope I am overreacting, but I fear that I am not.

We will see in the next 2-3 weeks (July 4th to July 11th) just how ""out of control"" things may be getting. Buckle up.

In contrast, we have a president whose lying and dereliction of duty has, so far, killed more than 139,000 Americans, and counting?  (BTW, that's more than the number of American deaths from all wars  since WWII).

Among these dead, were Americans who answered their duty when called upon by their country. Unlike a coward with a bone spurs but proudly boasting about grabbing women's genitalia as if something that his children would be proud of him as a father.

The thought that they adopted the described course of behavior out of fear of losing their position if they crossed the President is virtually unthinkable.

In addition to staining their collective reputations beyond repair, the entire cabal has failed monumentally in attaining the desired result.  The economy, writ large, is no more open today than it was in April.  The only thing that will sustainably return the economy to normal is confidence.  Widely shared confidence that it is safe to pursue previous economic behavior.  There are simply too many people who are self isolating, knowing that they meet one or more of the criteria that are known to make them vulnerable to serious illness and/or death.  There are too many businesses that took the risk and expense of reopening, only now to find their customers are not returning or they are being told to shut down again.  There are too many people holding on to every penny that they have, knowing that their income stream may disappear at any minute.

Before that, after promising “millions of tests” they backtracked, largely leaving states on their own to purchase critical supplies on the free-market, forcing states to bid against each other, knee-capping an efficient and effective fight against the virus. The fight within the administration was between people who wanted to use all the best tools to fight the pandemic, like federal production, and ideologues who wanted to use just one, the “free market” which was not able then, or now, to meet demand.

Thus her media reputation for her ""infectious disease expertise"" is hardly mobilization for an acute pandemic due to an unknown disease; her expertise is the approving of 5-year strategic plans in the PEPFAR program, a Bush era program that provided drugs to lesser developed countries struggling with the reduction of HIV prevalence and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, among other reduction and prevention strategies.  Key point:  40 years after the fact, HIV is not an acute illness, and thus modeling has time to play out.  An acute outbreak due to a new virus for which no one had any antibodies or even knew anything about should never have employed decision making based on these kinds of models.  The immediate (and current) need is for effective and timely response.  Today I read that Nueces County in Texas has 80 infants that have tested positive for covid-19.  Playing with models did not help those children and their families.

We have 40 years of knowledge about how HIV spreads, and some evidence-based assumptions about its treatment and prevention.  We do not have that knowledge base for covid-19.  We couldn't have had a worse person in the WH from the public health world than her."

A perfect exemplar of this strategy would be my Senator Pat Toomey (Republican, Pennsylvania) who until June, said virtually nothing about the pandemic, until it became apparent that America was becoming fully besieged. Then he broke his silence and, like Trump, for the first time,  recommended that people wear masks.  The loquacious emails I now routinely receive from him indicating what he calls his ""laser focused"" attention are far too self-serving, far too much and far too late to help ordinary Pennsylvanians.   And fundamentally every single one of them ignores the core of the problem -- that the Republican coalition in  in the federal government -- Trump and the Republican Senate majority, were unable to respond effectively in the absolutely zealous manner required, because they decided to run away from the challenge.

I believe that when the Trumpies looked at the chaos in Europe and considered how all-involving, arduous, technical and long-persisting an effort would be required to get the job done, they decided not to engage.  Trump and his cronies, as has been -- and will be further documented -- came to Washington to make money, gain power and play golf, not to work on behalf of the American people."

The crisis in the state of Florida, ICUs at 122% capacity and the clueless governor, a trumper, thinks it's great for the health of  Floridians to go to gyms and restaurants during the viral surge. Mr. Trump doesn't believe the greatest depression in our history will arrive in the U.S. next year. 

We Americans are just hanging in during these last chaotic months of Donald Trump's reckless presidency. The world has turned away from admiring the U.S., has seen our American Dream become a nightmare. Former allies in Europe and Asia pity us and laugh at our egregiously ignorant leader.  Meanwhile we're just trying to survive every day."
2020-07-18 21:15:35,Trump’s ducking of responsibility and placing it upon governors may prove to have a silver lining if the ignoramus ideologues serving as Republican governors are identified by voters as pusillanimous sycophants and removed from office.

2020-07-18 21:38:58,With 1% of the US population with confirmed positive COVID-19 cases and 0.04% of deaths it has not been the end of the world. surely 43% of deaths due to COVID-19 in nursing homes in NY and elsewhere could have been avoided but hopefully lessons have been learned for future pandemics. Success with FDA approved treatment will keep the death rate to a minimum and 10 times less than deaths due to all leading causes. The pandemic is by no means a molehill compared to the mountain of other troubles in urban America but I think it will require continued attention from the Trump administration down to the governors and mayors especially if there is a push to reopen America safely.

2020-07-18 21:13:56,"The intentional refusal of the trump administration to take control of this pandemic while throwing away the pandemic response manual started by Bush the younger is an act of criminal negligence.

Unfortunately, they will not be able to be prosecuted for first degree murder and receive the death penalty in federal court, but they can be removed from our consciousness this November.

They have killed over 110,000 Americans (excess deaths with total death of 140,000) and every death from Covid-19 from now on are their responsibility.

Compare us to all other civilized countries and these statistics are just getting worse.

It does little good to start naming names now.  The polls show how the American electorate feels about these greedy monsters and November will be the reckoning. In 1918 when there was no treatment and little knowledge of how to prevent contagion, ignorance was a justifiable defense.

In 2020 with our scientific knowledge, intentionally withholding known measures has no defensible justification.

This is a republican party problem.  They are killing Americans by reducing regulations in the work place and EPA, taking away health insurance, and withholding public health services in a pandemic.  

There are not enough stupid voters in America to elect a republican dog catcher.  Kick the bums out in November."

This is showing that close to 50 percent of all new infections worldwide are taking place in the US and Brazil at present.

Governor Pritzker had been trying since February to get supplies from the Federal government.  He was told - on the way, next week, only to be in the phone the next week with nothing, time after time.  Pritzker concluded that if he continued to wait for the Feds, the state would have Covid-19 growing all over hidden and silent, with no way to know where it was.  

Through the rest of March and April, the governor focused on testing supply chain.  Testing was woefully inadequate in early days, with very high positivity.  Finally some breakthroughs in late April in the supply chain, bringing online Illinois' own labs, Illinois' own test kits (with one day turnaround), and begging for anyone with lab experience to help run the labs in 2-3 shifts to process the results quickly.  Then we began to finally see the virus.  Finally we could open up the testing more and not restrict it to those with known exposure or symptoms.  The numbers doubled.  

Trump was no where to be found, and did everything he could to harm our fight.  We fought against the virus and it's most powerful ally - our President.  Yes he is responsible for thousands of deaths.  If there were a prize which is antithesis of Nobel Peace Prize, Trump would win it."

Reading the material ,one better understands how insulated from the facts the president has been throughout the unfolding and worsening of the pandemic.Part of the responsibility lies with his entourage seeking to provide him with an optimistic economic recovery message, part can be attributed to the president's own lack of interest towards  topics related to the pandemic, seen by him as inconsequential at first, then reluctantly promoted as worthy of his personal presence and comments. Finally labeled  a major annoyance and an outright impediment to his campaign to re election.
 From the outset, the crisis was dealt with, more as an abstract problem of no direct concern to the bunch of technocrats assembled to provide answers and a federal response. Everything was looked at through power point charts and mathematical models. If one did not know better,one might think this was an AI response ,not an actual human one.
Dr Fauci was the human disturbing element, silenced ,derided and ultimately vindicated while hundreds of thousands got contaminated and sickened, not only in the US but abroad , as leaders of countries like Brazil, India and South Africa to name three, took their cues from the US administration response.

To navigate these hazards human civilisation must operate from a factual science-based understanding of reality.

Unfortunately a political system driven by ideology and vested interests that relies on propaganda, gerrymandering, court-stacking and social media tools that enable mass social engineering to advance its objectives will necessarily fail when a greater force of Nature is unmoved by fatally flawed policies and political spin.

With long play problems such as climate change in which cause and effect are separated by decades it is easy for politicians to get away with atrocious lies, deceptions and bad decisions.

When fighting a virus that is operating in near real time, the consequences of magical thinking, incompetence and negligence become evident very quickly.

The lesson for Conservatives is choose your lies more carefully. You’ve gotten away with little lies such as trickle down theory and not so little lies such as the war in Iraq for too long. But this time you have out done yourselves.

The lesson for the rest of humanity is that we must bludgeon our way past all of the lies of Conservatives and overcome all of the ways they cheat the political system.

   The administration, more focused on different humanistic models threw caution to the winds, rationalizing that unemployed people enduring long periods of forced isolation will suffer psychological trauma.

There is no indication that a cost-benefit analysis was even attempted, let alone that the human cost was given due weight.  I expect no better from Trump.

She describes a ‘toxic positivity’ where the family is unable to accept any harsh or unpleasant reality (even an external one); so Trump too has to deny it, and as a result has never born any responsibilities, or changed course, even with bankruptcies, for his mistakes. His father enabled this attitude by rescuing him.  If external reality is unacceptable, self-awareness and self-criticism are even less so. Any negative feedback (such as an unbeaten virus) is unbearable. 

He thought he’d dealt with it, gone ‘to war’, and it would be sufficient.

Instead he decided and recognized that it’s politically convenient among his supporters  to claim it’s a hoax, or perpetrated by the Dems (and/or China) to sabotage his re-election. Except that by doing so, he can’t see that he is the one who in fact is sabotaging it, instead of being praised as the calm, measured leader who took the nation through an enormous crisis.

Until their is a combination of significant mitigation, accurate testing with quick results, enough effective drugs to treat those who are hospitalized and vaccines that will be safe and effective to give protection from the virus Americans will re reluctant to fully engage in life as we once knew it.

Trump followed Dr. Birx's optimistic, data filled models, yet he is blamed for following them, because he ignored the advice of the experts whose predictions were closer to how it actually turned out.

Very little could have stopped the initial wave, which was already spreading in New York before we even knew it was here.  Even Dr. Fauci was saying we didn't need to change our behavior.  No one blames Gov. Cuomo for sending infected elders back to their nursing homes where they infected and killed thousands of others.

Now, the second wave is hitting the other states.  The biggest failure, as I see it, is the failure of many Americans to take minimal measures to mitigate the spread.  Partly because the evidence about masks was and is conflicting (even from the experts), partly because people don't want to wear masks, partly because they lack empathy and concern for others, partly because many of them are just plain stupid, partly because many of their leaders at many levels from Trump on down failed to motivate them with concern for others.  The most disappointing thing for me is not Trump, who was at least trying, vigorously if in many ways ineffectively, to deal with the problem, but large swaths of the American public, who couldn't care less."

2020-07-18 21:44:20,"Anyone who is acquainted with Donald Trump's record as a real estate developer would have insight into Trump's incompetence in this incalculable and continuing tragedy. As a developer, he demonstrated no managerial skills. He could not organize or delegate. HIs bluster and bravado led to his businesses declaring bankruptcy six  times. It appears that he and his administration are setting an equivalent course for America, by wrecking or disabling large parts of the American economy, and causing workers to suffer."
2020-07-18 21:49:42,"Trumps sole tactic is to bludgeon his opponents into submission.  When he meets an opponent who refuses to be bludgeoned, trump immediately gives up and pretends the opponents does not exist.  This is his “leadership” style, proven over the last several years.  Of course it has led to massive failure and incompetence at all levels of our government."
2020-07-18 22:23:02,"A tragic but compelling account of a President and a very weak team of advisors jumping to conclusions based on wishful thinking.  It takes great strength of character to be steady, patient, careful and ""conservative"" in dealing with a monumental crisis like COVID.  There were many voices cautioning that we were opening up too quickly; that we needed to wait at least another month and proceed with great care with reopening.. But those voices were ignored by the White House.

Our country has paid an enormous price for electing a President without the qualities or the qualifications necessary to handle the most difficult job in the world.

We have a chance to choose better in November.  I pray that we will do better as voters and that we have learned our lesson."

We were scurrying around like rabbits trying to scrape together whatever PPE we could find, and here he was on TV talking about the national stock pile and billions of dollars in PPE .
Guidance ? Well  it wasn’t coming from him and his “historic” response￼.
I knew anyone intelligent from his team of experts would be bounced as soon as he crossed opinions with them￼.
We got through it.

Therefore, we are quickly edging toward 140,00 dead Americans, most of whom could have seen another day, or month or years, had he followed the simple advice of the CDC and managed the shut down and reopening per their guidelines.  This is a total failure of our administration to act for the good of the people of this country; all of us.  Trump takes no responsibility, but we must hold him and the Republican Party responsible.

Blame is not on the states. It is the individual voters who put these people there. The same individuals who devalued the education, put their faith in god and preferred guns over community safety.

We, the individuals, like to vote where we see individual benefit and to the speaker who promises to save our taxes. Save our taxes from what - from ourselves.

It is our self destructive inclinations that have brought us here and we must bear the cross for the rest of the Via Dolorosa."

The entire Coronavirus scenario was predicted in advance, and the US had contingency plans.

Under ANY normal President, the US would have been working with China, allies, and international agencies last November and December, to prevent this pandemic from leaving China to begin with.

Instead, Trump fired all the planners, denied the science, and refused all collaboration.

Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Depression.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

There can be no progress in health or economics until Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021."

He is going to make statues and window regulations as the most important issues Americans are facing so he won't have to face his absolute failure in the virus response. He will not even propose the most basic mask safety laws even though the countries that have far better results then America have all done that. Why? Because that would be admitting his mistake and Trump can not and will not ever confess to his errors."

As Bill Maher pointed out, ""The root problem we got here is Republicans are better at politics, so they get elected, but once in office, they can't do anything because their idea of government is *dismantling government!* So, let's also skip the 'we-need-to-be-less-partisan' virtue signaling when it's obvious Republicans have a proud, proven legacy of 'Government Dysfunction Syndrome.' Yesterday it was Bush and Giuliani [with 9/11], today it's Trump and [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and [Florida Governor] Ron DeSantis [with COVID-19], and we can only be safer when every last one of them is voted out."""

That was abundantly clear from the beginning as we watched her fawning performance at task force briefings and during media interviews.  She decided early on that she was firmly planted on team Trump.  Her shame faced silence as Trump encouraged the nation to inject or inhale lysol was a betrayal of her office and the grieving Nation.  She should resign her post and apologize to the country."

2020-07-18 22:19:51,"The abandoning of the pandemic by Trump is the reason we are in this massive growth pattern of new infections. Trump pushed the responsibility down hill to people who did not have the knowledge or power to control the process of protection against the virus. The inconsistencies in this approach are massive. Without one voice coming down to the Nation, pandemonium will continue to reign. For this handling of the pandemic, Trump does not deserve re-election. He does deserve punishment for the thousands who have died on his watch."
2020-07-18 22:24:47,"Don't blame Trump, he is a symptom, not the cause. How can a country, that is so rich, so advanced, become a such political basket case ? When this is over, and that won't happen this year, america should rethink it's whole society, starting at community level. 

Italy and Greece have not a great reputation for effective leadership, to put it mildly. But both country acted fast, decisive and citizen showed a high level of allegiance.
Italy was especially hard hit, because they had an huge surge much earlier than must other countries, and had no time to prepare, testing kits were not available, and very little was known about the virus. Considering this, italians really exceeded all expectations by fighting back this virus.
America failure stands out because they had really a head start. The virus came a month later to the US, and was at first concentrated to the area of NY before spreading. America had time to prepare, had much more information about the virus than other countries, and still goofed it.
This feels like race, where every participant is already preparing for the after-party, while the considered champion is still alone on the track trying to reach the finishing line.
Face it, America is not great anymore."

It's abundantly clear from this article that Dr. Birx is the owner and the source of those awful projections that led the entire nation down the wrong path. She should be held partially responsible for the frightful decisions that came out of that team."
2020-07-18 22:39:02,"So Dr Birx decided, barely weeks into an nascent pandemic, with  pitifully inadequate levels of testing, PPP and knowledge about transmission and treatment, went about the WH promoting ""It's over""?  

With this crowd of tools ""running"" the country?

I am beyond stunned."
2020-07-18 22:41:17,"At a certain point the only tool we have against an out-of-control pandemic is lockdown. Unfortunately, I think we've reached that point in a number of sunbelt states. Half measures like mask mandates are no longer sufficient because community spread is raging, overwhelming the ability of contact tracing to contain the pandemic.

Contact tracing and isolation are not possible when you have a positivity rate over 8 percent. Contact tracing is also not possible when testing labs require days to return results. By that time, most infected individuals have already passed the infection along to others.

Italy contained its pandemic by enacting a complete lockdown that lasted for months. So did Spain. Their citizens didn't get into stupid arguments about whether masks work, and their governments spent those lockdowns preparing to reopen. Our government wasted that time.

This is a once-in-a-century pandemic, and we need to get serious if we're going to avoid 100,000 new infections a day. We need another lockdown in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California;. We need a national testing and  contact tracing strategy, at long last. We need real leadership."
2020-07-18 22:26:35,"I learned from a half-dozen years on the board of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation that skilled management in difficult times is a thing of beauty to behold. It is rather like watching an Olympic gymnast go through her floor exercise routine: something I can appreciate, even if I don't have the skills to do myself. How curious (and disastrously so) that the president of the United States is not interested in engaging with the challenges of executive leadership. It is so important, and also so very interesting.

He is incurious to an extent that brings death into the world. I suspect he is not capable of understanding this."
2020-07-18 22:32:21,Science denial doesn't look so good in a pandemic.  What is more chilling is the 'wash over' game on full display.   It is brutal to watch and business failures are only now beginning to show up.  The costs in lives and long term health are yet to be determined.
2020-07-18 22:19:31,"I find the chronology in this otherwise good article very confusing.  When Dr Birx told the WH that cases were going down, were cases going down?  The article makes it seem like she was telling people what they wanted to hear.  But what if she was she correct?  Why is it wrong to rely on data rather than anecdotal evidence?  I have the impression that the more that two dozen Admin sources for this article are covering their own behinds, by making it seem they were following scientific evidence when they took the decision to push for lifting the lockdown.  I cannot tell from reading the article if the number of new infections was going down when Dr Birx reported they were going down. 

A very interesting fact is the pressure of the Republican Governors and of the Conservative machine.  I wonder what went on there.  From outside of the US, I was under the impression that Trump gave cues to the Governors.  But maybe the story is more complex than that?

Good article overall."
2020-07-18 22:27:41,"In reading this, it's easy to initially be angry at Jared, Dr. Birx, and the governors of states who pushed to open - to name a few, but it's important to remember that the ""buck stops"" with the POTUS. Regardless of the failings and short-comings of others, Donald Trump is responsible, and he let the nation down."
2020-07-18 22:40:16,A great article.  This is why I read the New York Times.  Thank you to all who produced this.
2020-07-18 22:09:52,I could accept all of this if republicans would admit that Trump is incompetent and that voting for him was a huge mistake. Instead I see people not wearing masks and saying Trump is doing a great job! It adds insult to injury. How misguided and ignorant can so many people be? Dr. Birx should offer a public apology at this point and confess that the entire administration has made one mistake after another. Thank goodness Cuomo has stopped complementing Trump at every briefing in return for Federal favors. I wish other governors would follow his lead.

I don't know how anyone who voted for this grifter cannot finish reading this article under a pall of shame and guilt over the tens of thousands of completely avoidable deaths hastened by the malignant incompetence of Trump and his enablers.

And yet roughly 40% of Americans STILL support him. On contemplating that fact my heart always sinks, ...together with my optimism for the future of our country."

2020-07-18 22:27:45,"I am surprised that no one sees how pandemic deaths figure into the upcoming election 2020. The majority of the people dying from the virus are minorities. Most minorities vote Democratic. By doing nothing to stop the spread of the virus, and by letting voters die,Trump and his supporters are killing off  potential voters for Biden."
2020-07-18 21:59:07,"This in itself is an indictment against Trump and his administration ; it is a case of the blinded ignorant and greedy , leading the selfsame . Not only is Trump accountable but so is Dr. Birx for not executing her duty as a physician that has taken the Hippocratic oath of first do no harm and bowing to politicized pressure . They alone are responsible for unnecessary deaths that could have been prevented . It is shameful that the United States has behaved in such a manner ; even China handled it better and I am no admirer of the Chinese government. Citizens are not only suffering the loss of loved ones but also the economic loss of jobs and wages ; those that supported and still support this mad demagogue are also responsible for believing the outrages he spouts , it has become our undoing ."
2020-07-18 22:14:18,"I would have liked to have gotten the full story on what the Trump Admin did to ""supply"" states with ventilators, PPE, testing supplies, etc.  It seems obvious that whenever a Trump official said something like ""we supplied ventilators"" what they were really saying is we ""bought up the supply and sold it to the market forcing states to compete to buy what they needed""...but to what extent?  Undoubtedly, nothing is given by the Trump Admin freely.  My guess is this was why Trump was shilling hydroxychloroquine so hard--Kushner likely bought up the supply in anticipation of demand that never came.  Amidst the sum total of corruption and abuses of power committed by Trump, I get this is like saying ""but check out *this* blade of grass!"""

2020-07-18 22:21:44,"Most appalling is the propaganda campaign now being waged (instead of a campaign to beat the virus)- claiming liberal snowflakes are exaggerating the 'flu' problem simply to sabotage Trump's re-election. Data is doubted, rising cases that lead to rising hospitalizations, ICU & ventilator care and - deaths- are dismissed. 
Death rates may have slowed because treatment strategies have improved as doctors came to understand the unique clotting & inflammation problems caused by coronavirus-- quite different from 'flu.'
Trump is laser focused concoct blame for others- demonize the Chinese, WHO, state governors and every Democrat. His totally ineffective travel ban on 1/31 is offered as evidence of his prescience, despite stopping no one. The virus was already spreading. 
This article exposes Birx complicity & Trump's abdication of federal leadership as catastrophic errors.
Trump's propaganda ignores facts & only prioritizes fluffing  him up. Masks are anti-Trump, losers worry about contagion.Old people and POCs are dying- who cares? People die.
But our boasting POTUS now faces a popular revolt- his bluster is no longer believed. His ignorance is a national joke. His stupid reliance on boosting the economy has added to Americans suffer as reckless openings have required new closings.
His base remains defiant- anti maskers & rally crowds. If they haven't seen a C19 death, they don't believe it. This is the ultimate dismantling of American know-how."

She is absolutely correct about this observation because I can see with my own eyes and ears how inappropriate he talks and acts on national TV.   I can only imagine how bad it gets when he is unfiltered by TV cameras and reporters!    

How dangerous is an unfit, unhinged person like this to our national security?   Plenty, and it’s a disaster for America!   Trump makes secret calls to Putin and dictators and seems to totally unable to distinguish when he is putting America in danger!   What we have found out about his past calls and secret negotiations with these dictators is that his deals were treasonous to our national security!   But his GOP enablers in the senate did not have the guts to make him accountable for his traitorous acts.   

So we are left with a traitorous, unhinged and lying baffoon sitting in the whitehouse with no restraints on the damage he can still do to our country!"

Now unmarked enforcement is detaining protesters in Oregon and the death toll from the pandemic is climbing into 130,000 range with refridgerated vans to retain the bodies thanks to the liar in chief who can not and will not help to unify the response but prefers to fight with the epidemologists by suggesting clorox and lysol injection. 
Folks the only things left now are to mark all large refrigerator vans with the TRUMP brand and ss markings on the Oregon fed enforcement.

Anonymous went on to tell us not to worry, there were responsible adults in the White House protecting us from Trump's worst impulses. Where are those people now? Any of them left? I get a pit in my stomach every night reading the news of this disaster, and if anyone in the White House thinks they are going to be able to spin history to escape blame they are as delusional as Trump."

How people behave at any one time depends a lot on how much danger they perceive. When we have a clown cart of a presidency intent on downplaying dangers with some toady governors following along, and a fraction of the citizenry rejecting science and demanding in essence the ""freedom to infect others"", it is not surprising that the U-Washington initial model assumptions did not apply.  The federal government should have been prepared at least this time around;  instead they offloaded all responsibility to governors and sought scapegoats in a naked effort to escape blame."

Donald Trump is consistent. He lacks any sense of empathy. When he stopped giving COVID press briefings is when he up and decided he had no more interest in the number of Americans infected, hospitalized, or deceased. 

He and his administration washed their hands of any responsibility in countering the virus, instead leaving it to each state to fend (often compete with one another) for themselves.

As Donald says “I take no responsibility” but he has no difficulty claiming credit."

Any other leader of any other organization would be shown the door for such mismanagement. Folks, he is still here. He is saying he will refuse to sign any stimulus that funds testing and tracing. He is quite willing to let tens of thousands more Americans die for his folly. Any other country would be staging massive demonstrations outside the WH calling for his resignation.

He can't be around competent people because he can't watch anybody doing something that shows the intelligence and leadership abilities that he doesn't have.  Rational people in a position of great responsibility surround themselves with the best, and praise those that get it right.  They assess the facts objectively. Trump can't assess the facts. And he doesn't have social values.  He can't read this article and understand what it says because he doesn't do ""facts"" or anything other than proving to himself that he ""has done a great job"" and that we are monsters for suggesting otherwise.  I can't even imagine what more harm he will do in the next four months as he gets angrier and angrier...at us!  For being critical of him, for not wanting to vote for him, for not being grateful to him. The most powerful person in the world is an angry lunatic. What will he with hold? What will he destroy? The virus is doing so much harm to so many millions of people. How do you think he really feels about this?  I think he wants to brush the whole thing off his back like an irritating bug and set everybody else up for failure too. Hasn't he already done that? It will be January before the pandemic is in the hands of people who are smart enough and compassionate enough to lead the country out of it."

As an experienced clinician and scientist I knew months ago that the only expert in the WH who knew what he was talking about was Dr. Fauci, and that Dr. Birx's judgement was severely impaired by the politics in the WH. And Dr. Jha also knew what to do but he was ignored. Anyone who votes to re-elect Trump is effectively pardoning a mass murderer."
2020-07-18 21:37:37,"Out of this horrifying article, this made me laugh (through my tears): Hope Hicks, a member of the coronavirus task force, whose job description is “protector of the president’s brand.” Huh?   That says all you need to know about the function of this so called task force. And Deborah Birx: I never really felt she was anywhere near as credible as Dr. Fauci but this article confirmed that she has become one of the many Swamp Creatures responsible for this tragedy."
2020-07-18 21:52:23,Great reporting from the NYT’s. Trump is clearly unable to handle the responsibilities of being President. His utter lack of empathy for Covid19’s impact on the American people should disqualify him in November.
2020-07-18 22:29:17,"Trump was briefed on the “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats“, the 2019 and 2020 DNI “worldwide threat assessment of the intelligence community” report outlining a pandemic threat, the HHS/FEMA/DHS exercise that showed large problems with preparedness (Crimson Contagion Simulation), the 2019 Biodefense Summit threat assessment, the FEMA 2019 “National Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment”, several NCMI Pentagon briefs to the WH and dozens of PDB’s early this year warning of a possible catastrophic pandemic, along with the WHO warning in late 2019. 

In response, he fired the NSC pandemic preparedness & global health security teams, cut the Pandemic Early Warning System (PREDICT), refused to employ a DPA to get national testing and PPE’s ramped up, cut the budget for the service contract to keep the national stock pile maintained, sent most of the US stock supply of PPE’s to China, fired Dr. Bright the top US vaccine expert, muzzled the CDC, Taskforce, and created a “shadow” Taskforce, refused efforts for mass N95 mask production, defunded the WHO, refused to develop a US mask/testing/tracing/tracking plan, and lied to the public, making the pandemic and lives of Americans a political football. And today he is trying to block billions of dollars for states to conduct testing and contact tracing in the upcoming coronavirus relief bill. 

Trump has done everything he can to make this pandemic worse."
2020-07-18 21:45:18,"Our president and this administration are totally incompetent, this is not news. I do not fault Trump for being the bigoted science denying conspiracy theorist he has always been. I fault those who voted for him.

2020-07-18 22:39:51,"Just a thought but, didn't Trump compare this to a wartime presidency.

   Nobody in the white house has any experience with virus's, never mind novel virus's especially Meadows, or Kushner.  
Mr. Trump is only concerned with himself and his re-election. He is golfing as we read this story. His aides and lobbyists saw dollar signs and started selling PPE gear by opening new companies with their white house connections.
   The whole white house is complicit in the way they handled this virus. His texts to ""liberate"" and his shameful ""they are coming for your 2nd amendment"" only created more problems for governors. That you have to ask the president for help and thank him publicly is a twisted joke.

The level of politicisation for something as simple as wearing masks, the false choice between openness and economic ruin (with no attention to needed social distancing) and the wild rise in cases. I honestly can't believe that so many at the upper levels fell for the rosy scenarios (although hearing about Dr. Birx's role helps to explain how they could have fallen for Trump's magical thinking).

It's too late to get it right, America, but it can still be less wrong—put on a mask and be serious about this!"
2020-07-18 21:27:05,"The moment the words ""I don't take responsibility at all"" were spoken by Trump in March, he clearly demonstrated and announced to the country that he was abandoning his ""leadership role on the virus"" and passing off all responsibility to every state's governor.

But you can bet your bottom buck that if/when a vaccine is developed and/or when this virus is contained, Trump will take ALL the credit because as he has stated numerous times in the past, he is a ""very stable genius."""

The second speaking of the failure of the landings ended in simple terms, “any responsibility for this failure is mine and mine alone.”  Those are the words of a true leader.  I see that this article is quite critical of Deborah Birx and with justification.  It matters not.  The catastrophe that has befallen our nation has one source, a hollow and ignorant man who takes zero responsibility and has no acquaintance with leadership.  The writer calls it one of the greatest presidential failures in generations.  He is kind.  There should be no qualification, Trump has broken our nation in ways unimaginable in our entire history."

2020-07-18 19:21:36,Thank you for this informative piece. There are really no words to describe the ignorance and self preservation of this administration. Brix included. Essentially every one of them have contributed to all the COVID 19 deaths.  It's absolutely abhorrent.

2020-07-18 21:07:41,"This is what you get when everything is politicized and polarized. In Norway our government made decisions, but heavily based on strong advice from our health agencies, some of those measures even stronger than the advice. The course of action has proven successful, up to now. As we open up for travel to and from most European countries, we may see increasing numbers again. Point is, the measures taken were acknowledged by all political parties, and we have 10! Why is it that one side i US defines the other to be wrong, no matter the issue? Cooperation in a crisis, who is he/she? Thank God we do not have anything similar to Mr. Trump."
2020-07-18 21:53:19,"The real problem in this whole pandemic was the absolute lack of any real leadership from the White House.  The President’s sole interest was, and continues to be his re-election.  Consequently, he conducted this pandemic by buck passing and scapegoating.  It didn’t work and it isn’t working now.  Doctor Birx may be a competent expert but she continuously treated the President with the obsequiousness he demands, never really telling the whole story, or emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.  Dr. Fauchi was the only one who persisted in telling the truth.  Now, Trump and his cohorts are trying to vilify Fauchi, who has worked for 6 presidents, both Republican and Democrat. Now Trump is trying hard to pretend that everything is fine.  He won’t wear a mask or advise others to wear a mask.  He won’t social distance and he doesn’t want tests.  Many Republican governors, Trump clones all, do the same.  Meantime cases and deaths are rising."
2020-07-18 22:49:19,Vaccine is not available. May never be. Immunity may not be a feature of COVID-19. We do not know.
2020-07-18 22:49:49,"I am no fan of Mr. Trump, but I applaud him for forcing Americans to deal with the reality that this virus will be something we all need to manage.   He has publicly advocated wearing masks but is leaving it up to each and every one of us to decide how to take care of ourselves.  

Its his job as President not to cower in fear of this contagion but to persuade all of us to deal with it head on.  And that means getting back to work, back to school, and back to some semblance of ""normal.""

Meantime, I find fascinating the NYT's obsession with pinning the blame on Mr. Trump personally for the increase in covid-related illnesses now that States have started to re-open. 

There is no question that the USG failed in a systemic fashion back in the February, when no one had reliable information and even Dr. Fauci was declaring that there was no need for facial coverings.

But now, five months later, it is now common knowledge that we all can take simple precautions to prevent the spread of this virus.  

Some of us are sufficiently intelligent and sentient to take such steps.  And some of us are not.  

It has NOTHING to do with who sits in the Oval office."
2020-07-18 22:51:22,"Our president wants to be the most powerful man in the world, and yet is allergic to leadership. Because of Donald Trump's illness, this elicits a bullying rejection of any signs of genuine leadership from anyone else, such as Dr. Fauci. 

Our infection and death trend lines have moved disastrously upward while Donald Trump has shunned the anti-coronavirus tool-box: testing, personal protective equipment; mask usage; physical distancing; isolation and early treatment of those infected and contact tracing. Many countries used each of those tools, and refined their efficiency as they learned from each other. 

Learning, facts and logical governance are anathema to the Trump Presidency, because Mr. Trump has just three objectives: 

1) Focus the public on invented enemies -- immigrants, brown people, women, non-Christians and of course, Democrats; 

2) Feed his rapturous base via Fox News and talk radio. 

3) Constantly seek attention. 

For Trump, America's prospects in the medium or long term hold no interest. (Next week holds little interest.) There is just seeking adoration -- to fill an unfillable void -- and feeling good or bad about today's headlines. 

Nothing more."
2020-07-18 22:56:41,"To Trump, this is all just a marketing problem.

We are being sacrificed to his abysmal deficit of empathy."
2020-07-18 22:58:39,"President Trump and the members of White House two teams dealing with the pandemic rejected information from the states and Dr. Fauci because it wasn’t what they wanted to hear. According to this piece, they chose instead to rely almost solely on Dr. Birx’s more optimistic projections and turned a deaf ear to the accompanying caveats.

Mark Meadows, Jared Kushner, Mike Pence, and Donald Trump failed miserably to govern during this crisis, but they’ll probably succeed in throwing Deborah Birx under the bus."
2020-07-18 23:06:48,"Irony of ironies.  When leadership at the national level has been and, for that matter, still is desperately needed to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, Trump and his incompetent and/or corrupt administration pushed off responsibility to the state level.  But, when it comes to street protests that arouse Trump's ire, he doesn't hesitate for more than a second--if that--to send in federal forces even when state and local officials do not want or need them on their soil.  God help us all as we watch this nation continue to descend to third-world status.  It's frightening in so many ways."
2020-07-18 22:45:24,"While 3 years ago, this might have been considered conspiracy theory, Trump's behavior in all things related to Putin have led me to believe this very well could be reality.

Believing is what you do in church and governing should never be based on ""belief"" but rather on facts. It has been crystal clear to a critical thinker outside the government that just about NOTHING was done right, including depending on the University of Washington ""model"", which is - after throwing a dart at a board - one of the worst predictive methods out there.

In the end this can be summarized with ""really hard wishful thinking, which was detached from reality and facts"". Everyone involved, including Dr Birx, should be ashamed of themselves for their dereliction of duty. 

We can still get this right if we start today. We won't get back all the people who needlessly died and we can't undo suffering. But we can start on the correct trajectory. 

I suggest a nation-wide total lockdown with the ability of local entities (States, cities, counties) to set a less rigorous strategy. After all, Miami (FL) and Wyoming ARE different.

Just look at what Italy did. You will NOT leave your house unless you have a written reason why you are essential and must leave. That simple.  

Do NOT tell me about the economy. By doing it wrong, you cause GREATER damage to the economy than you do by doing things right."
2020-07-18 23:16:47,"COVID-19 is the worst avoidable disaster in modern American history. It is undeniable that America's dubious distinction of being the COVID-19 capital of the world is due primarily to one single factor- failure of leadership by the federal government. 

Almost every nation's leaders took early & decisive action to control the virus. Stay at home orders were mandatory. Social distancing was aggressively enforced. Only Donald Trump failed to grasp or accept the nature & extent of the threat we faced. He delayed far too long before even starting to face up to the problem. 

But by then, it was too little & too late. He essentially waved the white flag when the enemy attacked. By abdicating any responsibility for confronting the worst public health crisis in a century, he has become a poster child for failure of leadership."
2020-07-18 22:44:36,"Don't fret, we may lose a couple hundred thousand, maybe even millions of Americans to the pandemic, but Trump will declare victory, Republicans will pass a bill to construct a beautiful monument (something grander than Mt. Rushmore) to honor their deity, and 40 percent of Americans will make pilmigrages to worship at the their new holy site. Holiest of all Christian relics.

Meanwhile, if we survive the pandemic, we can say we lived through the most harrowing time in America's short 231-year existence.  It was a noble experiment. Until Republicans discovered their inner hatred for America and Americans."

Or defeating a widespread virus is actually happening just because PR people say it is. And the ironic tragedy is other countries follow our scientists’ and institutions’ findings, recommendations, and research, but our government does not. The country is in a terrible direction if the simulacra of a person, position, or administration can be so believed that so many of us follow this lie into a deep well of death and suffering. The term Medieval comes to mind with complete distrust in facts and knowledge, and all this in the most advanced and wealthy country on earth. Truly dispiriting."
2020-07-18 23:16:28,I understand Trump has been attacking the Great Society and New Deal as best he can but the people around him must realize that this kind of Republican malfeasance is what led to the New Deal and 4 terms of Roosevelt in the 1st place.  Unless some kind of equal time doctrine is employed I don't think 4 terms is likely but Biden could play his cards well enough to move onto the $10 (and Harriet Tubman will be back on the $20)
2020-07-18 23:39:41,"We had a window, starting in March, to really contain the spread of the virus. If the incidences of virus transmission had really bottomed out by now, it would seem reasonable and prudent to reopen schools across the country. Because we failed at that goal in dramatic fashion - we are basically in no better shape in July than we were four months ago - in fact, possibly worse shape - reopening schools is a great way to start numerous super-spreads of the coronavirus, which will ping-pong between students, teachers, parents, and others who come in contact with them. Schools should be kept closed at least through the remainder of 2020, or realistically, until virus transmission rates have drastically dropped, and stay there."
2020-07-19 00:03:54,"We need to learn our lesson from this.  A leader who is in charge of everything, takes credit for every good thing, but refuses responsibility for when things turn bad is no leader at all.  Our political system produces that type more than any other.  It's their fault, but to the extent that we don't give elected officials room to admit they were wrong, we the people are responsible as well.

We should seek out and elect leaders who have a proven track record of being able to admit when they've been wrong."
2020-07-18 23:30:24,"Actually the historic moment was Feb and part of March, when Trump sneered at the pandemic. Perhaps he assumed it was just another problem, ie, something that could be fixed with money. Or maybe he was stimulated at the thought of signing trillions of dollars in checks to his “friends” and voters. Meanwhile many other countries appealed to patriotism and personal character and easily beat this virus, back to work and school in 8 weeks. On 2000 years from now, trump may be the only us president students remember, thanks to his slow motion blunder."
2020-07-18 23:51:04,"What is clear is that Trump and his advisors saw the pandemic as a political problem, not a public health crisis. No where in this article is there any indication that the White House was desperate to bring the pandemic under control, or that there was much concern about the people getting sick and dying. As with everything in the Trump White House, the sole concern was how this made him look and how it might affect his reelection. They had no problem with people dying, and still don't, as long as Trump is not blamed.  The administration has reached a new level of shamelessness, something that seemed impossible given its low level throughout Trumps reign. And then it reached an even more despicable level by proposing cuts to the CDC and testing in the midst of the current surge. Who could have imagined this happening in the U.S.?"

There are other issues at play between countries that succeeded and those that didn't in reigning in the virus. In our case, it was never a partisan issue with political overtones. If you don't do A . B will happen. Fact. An equal partnership was set up between our PM and the director of health. The science was always followed, then the economy would thrive in a covid free environment. Severe but short lock down was carried out, then gradual steps to back to normality only when the testing supported elimination of virus. Great communication from our leadership created a belief we were all paddling the same way."
2020-07-18 23:58:43,"This is fine, and devastatingly heart-breaking reporting.

But it leaves unanswered how we move on from today. The NorthEastern states and New York appear to have put in place adequate levels of testing to tamp down those “embers” but here in CA they’re flaring up. If the West Coast states can contain the virus—a big if—we’ll still be at risk from a high volume of travelers from the ¾ of the country that’re What Me Worry states, or inextricably linked to them.

Do states that manage to get test/trace/isolate Policies in place ALSO need to quarantine visitors? Will states be able to afford the policies that’ll prevent them from being threats to the rest of the country? How can companies afford to ramp up production of supplies, in advance of firm commitments to pay for plants?

We’re putting a lot of hope into a vaccine. There’s reason to worry that even once we get one, little or waning effectiveness means it’ll be just part of our fight. Best-case scenarios are that COVID will be raging for the rest of this year, and may be a huge challenge for years to come.

We need not just a list of talking points but a national dialogue on priorities & costs for what needs to be done, and then a call to action all of us can agree on"

2020-07-18 23:34:02,"Why is he still here?

What other democratic country would allow this amount of death and disruption?  What will it take to mobilize lawmakers in congress?

South Korea is rated higher than the US regarding freedom for its citizens. This would indicate that they have the option of rebelling against lock down orders, social distancing and masks. I believe that the leadership in South Korea acted quickly with the truth, unlike the leadership in the US.

Let’s compare:
April 1. 2020
South Korea, infections peaked at 1,062- truth disseminated, action taken
United States, still growing at 26,756-no action taken, truth hidden, lies

July 16, 202
South Korea, new infections 60, early action and truth.
United States, new infections 70,254, still no action at Federal level, more lies, etc.

South Korea reduced new infection to approximately 5%
United States increased new infections by approximately 260%

A simplified calculation shows that intelligent action by government and its citizens could have resulted in The United States having a current new infection total of 3513. Yes, there were more factors in play during this time, but I feel that early and continued action plus the truth would have put us on the road to normal by now if not earlier.

If we had leadership that understood that the way to get the economy back to near normal was to deal intelligently with the pandemic. Unfortunately, that understanding is predicated on assigning value to others rather than yourself."

Ergo, something like the “Brown Shirts” of Nazi Germany only wearing modern military gear show up!

2020-07-19 00:05:23,"Trump’s efforts to ignore COVID-19, pretend it’s not a big problem, and shame and lambast those attempting to mount an effective response to it would be incomprehensible to anyone not familiar with his MO. How could a sitting president blithely dismiss a pandemic disproportionately affecting Americans? How could he sling mud at anyone taking the problem seriously and trying to use the resources of the federal government to address one of the greatest health crises of modern times? How could he possbly prioritize the economy over the lives of Americans?

And yet, the reasons are painfully obvious. First, the virus is immune to contumely, and thus invulnerable to his greatest weapon. Second, since he despises those with actual competence and specialist knowledge, he must blacken the names of those most qualified to address the crisis. Third, since he has no answer to the crisis and won’t listen to those who do, he must deflect public concern by minimizing the direness of the situation. Fourth, he knows that the financial hit caused by COVID-19 completely obliterates his one supposed achievement, the economy. If he’s relying on people to focus on the pre-virus economy and ignore the present he’s likely to be bitterly disappointed."
2020-07-19 00:13:54,"And now today I read that trump wants funding for enhanced testing and contact tracing to be eliminated. 

My husband thinks trump wants to lose the election and is sabotaging his chances by his insane words and  actions. If that’s the case he’s taking us all down with him.

I’ve never felt more despondent. Our lives are literally being held in limbo or worse, by the madness of one man."
2020-07-19 00:15:48,"The White House staff rushed away from a leadership role on the virus because they did the simple calculation showing that the White House COULDN'T lead.  They had a loose cannon/mentally compromised president.  They also had key parts of the federal government (HHS, NIH, CDC) that had been crushed by endless Republican cuts to their budgets and the exodus of experts during the three of Trump's disastrous presidency.  Given that the White House staff didn't even have a weak reed to rely on, they made the logical decision to simply shove the real work off onto others -- most obviously state governors, who were in no position to effectuate any sort of coordinated response to the novel coronavirus.

108 days to go until November 3."
2020-07-19 00:23:06,"Trump is and has been actively sabotaging the country for some time. There is apparently nothing we can do about it until Nov 3. Even if he is voted out, he will continue to ravage America for three more months."

Although it might be pointless, it is also essential that those
zones in which the populations still believe that the administration did as good a job as was possible ""under
the circumstances"", and   there are plenty of people therein who really still believe this,  see this article. 

Perhaps   someone can  simply upload a video of a  recitation  of this (along with some good graphics and time line of  appropriate quotes of the complicit guilty parties trying to put a happy face on the mess they were responsible for creating) and try and get it to go viral? 

The fundamental point is that with the active help of fx et al ""news"", 40% of the population is sufficiently programmed  to 
be absolutely convinced that ogre in chief has done as good a job as possible ""under the circumstances"".

2020-07-19 00:12:37,"This report confirms what I had already suspected.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised one day to learn that some players in this sorry saga were not motivated by the mistaken belief that the battle against COVID-19 had been largely won by April, but by more cynical calculations, namely:  (1) handing over responsibility for managing the pandemic to state governments could insulate President Trump from any responsibility for further outbreaks and deaths while allowing him to assume the role of economic cheerleader and savior; and (2) herd immunity would be the fastest track to economic recovery and reelection while victims along the way could be forgotten or written off as old people, poor people, people of color, and statistics."

But seriously, did anyone with a brain think that it would be otherwise.  Trump never had any interest in governing.  His second team, or is it the third team, currently masquerading as government officials are obsequious incompetents who have no interest in the public good.  After the tax cut for the wealthy was passed Trump and the republicans have nothing else to offer except  denying women control of their bodies and unlimited access to guns.  President Biden will have to do a thorough housecleaning.  Dr Birx will be among those ushered out the door.  She failed her “Profile in Courage” moment."
2020-07-18 23:06:57,"Trump and his cabinet's highest priority was always his reelection, not the lives and health of people.  They first acted with the hope that the pandemic would do limited damage.  When that failed, they threw a Hail Mary pass and made a Faustian bargain:  open up business activity prematurely so that by the time the elction comes around people will remember the economic gains and forget the price paid in lives.  Even those have now failed. 'Liberating the states' is exacting a terrible price both in lives and longer disruptions to business.  Such miscalculations are not unusual in authoritarian regimes where one man's folly can cost the nation dearly.  For the US such gross failures of  governance are not usual."
2020-07-18 22:45:09,"There is something very wrong with our country that chose Donald Trump to become our leader. His personal history,actions, speeches,activities were there for us to see but we picked him as president, anyway.

We can't even rid ourselves of the electoral college which has become outdated for years.

Churchill was not paying us a compliment when he told the world that the united states will always do the right thing after they have tried everything else.

To show how backward we have become, our country has a law mandating seat belts when driving an automobile but we have no law that mandates face masks in this pandemic which kills more people.
We have had three and a half years of Trump as president and there is still a chance that he will be reelected.

There is something very wrong with our country and the problem is us.

2020-07-18 23:51:40,"The only poll that matters two of three Americans do not believe anything Trump says about the coronavirus.  The underappreciated rationale for the actions taken not solely offloading blame on the states, much more craven.  A dramatic jobs recovery viewed as his ticket to reelection.  The gamble the public health and welfare versus a jobs recovery embraced by Trump. He cajoled and berated red state governors to reopen writ large.

Given the scope of the catastrophe Trump cannot throw the Governors under the bus; blame faulty science; or criticize China for his premature reopening of the states.  Trump created the box he occupies, no way out short of admitting a colossal blunder.  Trump don't pivot he quadruples down.

This pandemic and our inept response (the worst in the developed world) is not just the greatest abdication of presidential responsibility in generations as the article points out, it is perhaps our GREATEST intelligence failure since Pear Harbor. Biden needs to pledge that we establish a Corona Virus Inquiry Commission (similar to the 9/11 and Financial Crisis Inquiry commissions) to understand what went wrong. Such a commission would need to look at multiple aspects that contributed to this failure (our lack of preparedness, misinformation, political pressures to reopen, a president who doesn't listen to intelligence briefings, key unfilled positions at our government agencies etc), with a specific look at political polarization and culture in the US, and opinion shows masquerading as news. One would hope that such a commission would name names and assign blame where it is deserved.
Of course, this presumes that the virus is brought under control and it is now clear to a majority of the population that we need new leadership in Washington if we are to have any hope of returning to normal life anytime soon.

No one but a co-conspirator can reasonably deny the deliberate intentional sabotage that the Trump Administration has perpetrated. Russia was adept at choosing Trump to destroy America. He has exceeded all expectations. Trump has called the Russian interference and the Pandemic hoaxes. Now he is insisting on cutting funding for more testing, contact tracing and the CDC. Only an enemy of America could do this now when 77,000 were diagnosed in one day. We need Trump and Pence to be arrested as well as their enablers and assistants, but our Republicans are watching their states go up in flames, millions lose their homes, jobs, insurance, their states bankrupted and this disease grow and grow. 
Why? Do Republicans really want an end to our country? Do Republicans want refrigerator trucks instead of mandating masks?

Its a pity that Dr. Birx's lifetime of professional achievement and service to public health will now be stained with the horrible toll of death and disability for the public she wanted earnestly set out to serve.

Because here we are six weeks later, and not a thing has changed. Trump is still as belligerently opposed to masks. His followers have dug their heels in deeper. We are headed towards 100,000 new cases a day. That’s 3 MILLION a month. Even if a small percentage of those die from COVID, a great number of the survivors will suffer respiratory illness and organ damage that will likely shorten their lifespan and decrease their quality of life."

His own party were starting to look for a replacement - then the virus hit. 

Morrison who suffers verbal effluvia shut-up for once, stood behind the competent state  premiers (our version of governor) and let them to the talking. Seemed like, whenever anyone asked him anything he'd point to a premier and say - ""what she said"". He got out of the way and started milking the virus for all its political worth.  HIs disastrous handling of the economy, the fires (people are still waiting for relief), the massive rorting of  government programs to help political allies win their seats - all forgotten.

But he always had enough $$ available to 'fix' his way out of things.

When Trump failed at business, he repeatedly declared bankruptcy.  He squeezed whatever cash & assets he could out of his casinos & left shareholders & creditors to absorb the financial loss while he declared bankruptcy. 

Trump apparently cheated on all 3 wives & doesn't take marriage seriously.  He got divorced twice & paid/threatened/bribed girlfriends to keep quiet.

Trump has feuded with lots of people for financial & personal reasons.  He repeatedly litigation to silence or squash people who could damage him.  He kept litigation going until his opponents faced financial ruin. The 2012 lawsuit he mounted against beauty pageant contestant Sheena Monin - who said Trump rigged Miss Universe - is an example of Trump legally battering a critic until they shut up.

Being president doesn't work that way.  There's no 'buying' or 'litigating' his way out of problems.  William Barr has tried to shield & protect Trump (as has McConnell) but the pandemic won't bow to pressure or disappear when ignored.

Trump isn't intellectually or psychologically equipped to take responsibility or solve problems.  It's not in his toolbox.  He's ignored the pandemic until its now sweeping unchecked nationwide & he's looking for others to blame for his shocking failure.

2020-07-19 01:00:57,"The New York Times ran a story on Germany which indicated contact tracing was done at a state and local level. This is a completely false narrative to think that the lack of contact tracing is not primarily the responsibility of state and local governments. There are zero reasons why New York City and New York State have failed to adequately address the need for contact tracing. The result is that New York is regularly in the top ten states with the most deaths. Still in July, this past week. You might not know this because the state issues false numbers about current deaths by not including probable deaths, and the media does not report this. To put this in proper context, the current 7 day rolling average for New York of 23 deaths/day ( see worldometer site ) is 8,380/year which if projected for the country's population would be 132,000. Wow, I did that in my head, but wait here while I check my math ... roughly correct, but here's the more accurate figure 
23/day * 365/year = 8,395 
US population 328 million / NY 19.45 = 16.86
16.86 * 8,395 = 141,540 deaths on an annual basis
Current US number of deaths? 142,869
You might claim that the number of US deaths will shortly rise well beyond 142,869, but that takes practically nothing from the claim that the media gives Gov Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio a free pass for a death rate that projects to a number deemed catastrophic. That's before making an allowance for the 142,869 including 32,552 deaths from NY."

We turned down the German test kits the WHO offered, the federal government delayed purchasing PPE from abroad when it was still available, Trump denounced the WHO, pulled back US experts working with the WHO in China, and gave notice of US withdrawal from the WHO.

While it's true that Germany's federal government supported  state and local efforts, keep in mind that New York State and California with country like populations and GDP, are well able to lead and organize contact tracing. It's never been a priority, and likewise getting people to cooperate with tracing is also not a priority. 

If this paper gave reports, day after day, of how successful countries like Japan, Germany, and South Korea, deal with the virus, maybe people would demand that their Democratic Governors of California and New York, do the same. Then perhaps their economies would start to recover, and children could go back to school, people would stop dying of the virus, the state's residents wouldn't live in fear.

That said, in the absence of a vaccine, it is unclear what this administration could have done to prevent the disaster that is currently unfolding.

Confirmation bias is impossible to avoid. But every MBA program and every leadership book teaches ways to minimize the impacts of inevitable confirmation bias. These include assuming your ideas are wrong, avoiding having everyone report to a single all-powerful leader, actively listening to a wide range of experts, encouraging real debate at the decision making table, and admitting mistakes.

So the Fox and mainstream facts and logic would have to be presented without endorsing them.  The latest statistics on deaths would be accompanied by a report that these statistics have been politicized and are unreliable.  

The Fairness Doctrine assumes an agreed-on universe on whose details reasonable people can disagree.  This agreed-on universe has vanished.  Reestablishing it would doom at least one of these perspectives, and probably both.  

We had a conventional wisdom on Reconstruction, doubted only by those outside the establishment.  It is still around, but a different wisdom on Reconstruction is now available.  It is hard to see that both are talking about the same place.  The new wisdom sees the old wisdom as the result of a Southern propaganda offensive and nationwide racism.

Oh right, since mail in ballots are so often rejected for being late, now this Administration is going to slow walk U.S. mail delivery just in time for the election.  That should successfully disenfranchise millions of voters.  The rest of the ballots can then be tossed because most of us don’t have a distinctive sharpie signature.

The Birx reliance on models approach for prediction was risky because the models blindly factor these cultural differences in social behavior.  The Fauci approach allowed for a parsing of behaviors.

After all, California was very stringent on reopenings and look at L.A. Miami was given flexibility and look at the current surge there, Faauciunderstands and even embraces Federalism

NYT, you have been very diligent with your duty as the Free Press, to keep us Citizens informed over the past few years (perhaps making up for your misdirection in 2016?)

As Citizens, we need to be diligent about our duty in Nov 2020."
2020-07-19 06:29:24,"What a highly insightful article on the behind the scenes manuvering  that have placed us in the perilous position that we are in today.  

So Trump's disasterous and highly wrongheaded decisions on this virus were given inpetus by a chief of staff (Meadows) whose sole mission in life in the last three and half years has been to further the political career of an incompetent and dangerous President.

And most surprisingly, a ONCE highly respected medical authority ( Dr Brix) who has ensnared herself in lending credence to Trump's false narrative.

When the chronicles of history are written these two will be given star billing in plunging this nation into a health crisis emergency that has ensnared millions of Americans."
2020-07-19 10:22:57,"The abysmal lack of any semblance of intelligence on the part of trump, meadows, miller, kushner - oh just the whole lot of them, has brought us to this point. We have lost almost 150,000 people who were loved, valuable, real; while these incompetents sit in our White House - apparently untouched, it is criminal.
Today I see that trump is planning to gut billions for testing & tracing - but that ""beautiful wall"" is apparently still funded...

I hope those who voted for him in 2016 & are planning to do so again will recognize their place in his hierarchy of importance because they are definitely at the bottom of the list."
2020-07-19 05:43:35,"Beating a pandemic requires an understanding of science, a lot of hard work, and shared sacrifice by all. Instead, we got Dr Trump and his republican enablers. And we're about to fall off a cliff."
2020-07-19 02:59:06,"The moment I heard Dr Deborah Birx effusively praise Donald Trump's competence and intelligence I didn't have a lot of faith in any guidance or expertise she might be providing. 

“He’s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data. I think his ability to analyze and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.”

This kind of ""Dear Leader"" style over-the-top praise has become common in Trump's theatrical cabinet meetings, but anyone participating in such absurd fiction regarding this obviously incompetent, unintelligent, uncurious, aspiring strongman immediately abdicates all expectations to be taken seriously by the scientific or medical community or anyone else, really. 

I knew that if she was engaging in such denial of reality it was either because she was a true extreme right-wing believer or someone who would say anything to stay in the good graces of Donald Trump; either way it was obvious nonsense and that's the last thing you want to hear coming out of the mouth of a science advisor."
2020-07-19 04:11:09,"The fact that Jared Kushner is described as an ""expert"" in dealing with supply chain and procurement management pretty much sums up this disastrous response. It's terrifying to see how a complete failure of leadership and the level of obsequiousness demanded by your president has caused so many unnecessary deaths."
2020-07-19 04:17:07,"Trump is responsible for the US response and over 100K deaths. If he cared less about his ego and gave an ounce of respect to science, we'd have more testing, more masks, and less deaths. Shame on Trump, shame on the GOP for enabling him. Trump has failed the US states with his lack of leadership and he's failed the American people. He failed covid19, he's failed the US troops, and he continues to put himself instead of his country's interests first. Trump = failure."
2020-07-19 04:30:57,"We almost made it. Four disgusting years without a national crisis. Then the bottom fell out and here we are. We’ll be lucky to make it through 108 more days of this, then, when Trump loses, he’ll have 78 days to burn down what’s left. A decade to rebuild the economy? How about a decade plus to reconstruct this country?"
2020-07-19 06:30:17,It’s criminal how this pandemic has been handled in the US.  In almost any other democracy leaders would have been forced to fall on their swords after such blatant displays of incompetence.
2020-07-19 03:28:11,"This is the same exact  incompetency that bungled leadership on HIV/AIDS as the reagan administration claimed It's them, not Us.  Covid 19 is all of us and has. been since December 2019. there is still no subsidized  mask distribution or free testing in our poor neighborhoods; our nursing homes or congregate centers where the vulnerable gather such as transit stations; airport s;   schools; churches; malls; playgrounds.   Any city planner knows exactly where Americans gather.  Instead of a simple swab on the corner where we live Trump monetized a pandemic to profit big Pharma Big Labs; Big Retail and failed to protect everyday Americans.    Just to win the 2020 election."
2020-07-19 03:37:44,"If Trump doesn’t want any responsibility as president, fine, don’t run for the office. Go away."
2020-07-19 05:10:28,"Dr. Deborah Birx is not only mendacious, but also meretricious. It's pretty clear to me that she's angling to replace Azar as Secretary of HHS should Trump be re-elected."
2020-07-19 05:28:35,"We are a nation at war.  But we are at war without a commander-in-chief, without a national armed forces, without generals to coordinate strategy and resources.  Instead, we have 50 commanders-in-chief, and 50 state militias, each acting on their own, going here, going there, sometimes acting against each other.  Casualties continue to rise, needlessly.  And all this White House can do is insist we step out from cover because major fighting is over, when bullets are flying past."
2020-07-19 03:46:03,"The Resistance movement is equally at fault in creating the dysfunctional, fertile conditions that allowed Coronavirus to grow wildly across the United States."
2020-07-19 03:58:54,"There appears to be a lack of diverse medical and epidemiological talent in the Trump Administration. This falls directly on how Donald Trump has mistreated people. He marginalizes people because they are smarter than him, disagree with him, or do not pander to his ego. Who would want to subject themself to this abuse?"
2020-07-19 05:27:19,"This whole thing has been a complete disaster, I truly can’t believe what a disgrace this administration is. The lack of governance along with their leadership is beyond pathetic."
2020-07-19 07:20:37,"I think it's an understatement to call this ""perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.""

I'd challenge anyone to name an equally bad failure of presidential leadership in the history of the United States."
2020-07-19 07:40:31,"Trump has a history of being short-sighted, back when he was running his Atlantic City Casino's into the ground. He wanted to build a parking garage for Limo's and other high rollers, they started building it, but Trump needed it done by a certain date for a big Prize Fight. The Engineers told Trump, that it takes a certain time for huge amounts of concrete used in the constriction to set, otherwise it would be weak and could fail, That timetable didn't work for Trump and he told the Contractors to forge on, this was too quick and the concrete did fail, killing workers and destroying the parking garage...Trump NEVER learns sometimes you can short-cut stuff."
2020-07-19 02:53:12,"It really feels and this article confirms it, that our leaders abandon us. So I ask, what good are they?"
2020-07-19 02:55:57,Someone threw Dr. Birx right under the bus. I would have liked to hear her side of the story. The rest of it is plain as day run of the mill trump malfeasance.
2020-07-19 03:37:21,"The perfect storm. A Leader completely incurious, a sizable populous incurious, and a pandemic that fits with NONE of their narratives. In order for masks or any public health order to be properly followed would require neither. We have both. Help!"
2020-07-19 03:48:22,This story would be even more comprehensive if it had explored and woven into the timeline the whole “distraction” that is the hawking of hydroxychloroquine by the President and some of his advisers. I’d very much look forward to understanding that angle as well and its interconnection to the debacle described here.
2020-07-19 05:22:30,"""Mr. Trump’s bet that the crisis would fade away proved wrong.""

trump is consistent. When it comes to Covid-19, every one of his bets, predictions, hunches, guesses, prognoses, prescriptions, ideas, comments, Tweets, and actions (to say nothing of his inaction) have been wrong. Wrong then, wrong now. Always wrong.

he is now spearheading a move to remove federal support for testing and other necessary actions to try to rein in the climbing case number and equally shocking death count. he is pushing for schools to open, without regard to the health of the school communities (students and their families, staff and their families, and others associated with schools). he denies culpability: ""The buck? What is that, and why is it stopping?"" Translation: ""Good luck, America. I am OUT OF HERE! Suckers!""

Instead, he goes to play golf. Golf.

Good luck, indeed, America."
2020-07-19 03:12:32,"There is a direct line from Ronald Reagan to McConnell, Meadows, et al, whose mission has always been to reduce the size and reach of the federal government. Remember Reagan’s statement, “The scariest nine words are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” Is it any wonder that a Republican administration, led by historically unprecedented incompetency, has brought us to this point?

Powerful reporting, thank you!"
2020-07-19 03:36:49,"Thanks to the NYT reporters for their excellent investigative work. The cumulative force of all the mistakes has left me in tears--from the lateness and denial of the response, to the president's refusal to ""take responsibility""--deliberate injury to Americans that doomed us from the start. Trump's dismissive and arrogant rejection of leadership: constructing a coherent federal response, modeling appropriate behavior such as mask wearing and social distancing, extending lockdowns and additional benefits, offering empathy or condolences--combined with his deliberate undermining and outright reversal of safety measures--has led to a tragedy of massive proportions. It's appalling and utterly dispiriting that Deborah Birx comes off as the worst kind of toady, more intent on placating a tantrum-throwing megalomaniac than adhering to the scientific principles of rigorous investigation that, properly applied, would have discarded her grossly inaccurate model. She's been a disaster. An administration of bunglers and worse, murderers. They should be arrested, indicted, and imprisoned for their lethal inaction."
2020-07-19 09:34:56,"Imagine if you will on December 8, 1941, FDR stands before a joint session of Congress and declares that a state of war exists between the United States and the Empire of Japan. But he takes no responsibility for a coordinated national defense and leaves it up to each individual State and municipality to bear the burden of conducting the war to protect the public and defend the United States of America."
2020-07-19 10:36:17,"Pop the Trump bubble on Covid-19.  I think we can defibrillate Trump’s engagement on Covid-19 by linking the quality of his own testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the White House with that of the general public.  If it takes 10 days for us to get a test result, so should his results.  And everyone physically around Trump should have free choice on mask wearing and physical distancing."
2020-07-19 01:50:38,"I think if you listen or listened to any of the televised interviews with Mary Trump, you will see that the so called President is INCAPABLE of behaving differently, which is NOT an excuse.  And he simply does not care that people are sick and dying. That is a hard concept for most human beings to grasp.

It's been obvious since he was inaugurated and it didn't take her book to teach us this. It's just confirmation.

All the people who work for and around him are equally responsible and complicit.

It's all dereliction of duty and manslaughter.  I prefer the word murder."
2020-07-19 06:56:18,Just more of the same from the dreary one Trump. Do not expect any moral authority or leadership. You cannot say the things he says publicly about people and lie constantly and still be taken seriously. Trump's expiration date is up!
2020-07-19 01:57:57,"Profound, shattering, never before seen complete and utter lack of judgment. Unfortunately, exactly what you’d expect from a man who has literally never been accountable for any of his bad decisions. Result? Catastrophic failure to lead because leadership demands humility. The humility that only comes from real challenges.  What a disaster."
2020-07-19 04:00:33,"Ah yes, April.
 That's when Trump should have been rolling out the U.N. style emergency food trucks....
February was the tragic month, for the country of which Trump is elected leader. Countries such as China's neighbors, all too familiar with the ticks and tells of the Middle Kingdom, put on their masks then, and went inside for 8 weeks. But not Trump's U.S. Ignoring February, then March... that will always be the tragedy."
2020-07-19 05:20:07,"I’m so scared... I’m so enraged. I fear for my family, because while I am old, my mother is older, and not in good health. My kids are thirty-somethings with their own kids, and maybe not as cautious as they think. A daughter is a teacher, safe now due to her school deciding to go virtual, but as of now that only extends into September. You begin to think of the odds at this point, that you’ve been lucky, but you hear every cough and notice every runny nose. 

I’m enraged, too, at Trump and his team. How could they have done this to us? How could they have been so non-caring about the health and welfare of 330 million Americans? How could they have decided it was okay to divide us at a time when we all need to be on the same team? If Trump would have been President during WWII, we’d all be speaking German and Japanese now.

My goodness, my goodness, my goodness...."
2020-07-19 02:46:46,"This story was very interesting but not surprising given that Trump is not a leader, never has been, never will be.  He has been given everything: wealth, a good economy, his father's business, and he has destroyed each of them, walking away and blaming everyone else for his failures.  He has the death of nearly 140,000 people on his hands, and those that have enabled him, especially Republicans, also have blood on their hands.

If we had a competent, caring leader (like Biden) this would have never been this bad, and we would be in a similar position to Europe.  Instead we are with the likes of 3rd world countries.  Even Vietnam has done a better job than the US.

I hope the American people who have had enough of this horrible man and president will vote in droves to kick him to the curb."
2020-07-19 03:42:32,"The basic deficiency is that Trump and the GOP think that people have no value except as widgets making money.  We are disposable and replaceable.  

Why value our lives?  Get out and work, and if illness strikes you down, move aside for the next widget.  

No need for testing, no need for aid, no need for treatment, no need for a vaccine.  This is the Trump way.  Get to work! and line his wallet."
2020-07-19 06:50:08,"This is Trump's fault, and the lost American lives are his responsibility. He should be held legally liable for probably 100,000 of those deaths.
He did not listen in late January when told to enforce social distancing. He did not listen at all in February. He did not listen for the first half of March.
In May he went against his own expert's recommendations by encouraging people to ignore social distancing and not wear masks, through his ""liberate"" tweets and and through not wearing a mask himself.
Lately he has insisted, as he did in February that that the virus would ""go away"" by itself. Of course, it has not, and it won't any time soon. He then combined dismissal of the virus's seriousness with a racist slur by calling it the ""kung flu"" at his Tulsa rally, where he encouraged people to crowd together and not wear masks.
If you think about it, and consider his responsibility to the well-being of Americans, these are actually criminal actions.
It's time he be held responsible for them.
Since he won't be, the least Americans can do is wake up to these realities, and remove him from office in November.
If we can't do that, then we 'll  get exactly what we voted for. And it will be devastating beyond anything we have seen so far."
2020-07-19 10:42:27,"I know why Trump can get his 4-5 hours of sleep each night—he believes the lies he tells himself. As for the rest of the task force members, I don’t know how they lay there head down knowing how completely they have failed all of America. This was always how the Trump presidency epitaph would be written, based on the total failure in responding to a crisis that landed on his doorstep. Trump’s incompetent and total failure in response to the crisis was as predictable as the fact that he would have to confront one. Sad!"
2020-07-19 04:15:53,And here we are: sleepless nights fed by incredulity since the election of this person as the leader of our country have fulminated into a fear of not knowing whether it is safe to go out to buy food for our families. God help us. The comfort of living in a democracy is a pipe dream.
2020-07-19 02:34:04,"If Democrats get a blue tsunami and take the House, Senate, and White House, it is absolutely critical to have some kind of systematic effort to hold the Trump administration and the GOP responsible for all the damage they have done to America. Thousands of Americans dead, millions with potential chronic health issues, economic devastation - and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

 The corrupt media they've built, the insidious flow of dark money - it all has to be dealt with.

There needs to be jail time, or these people and the people behind them will just come back worse if they get another chance."
2020-07-19 03:16:28,"Dr. Birx looks to be the ringleader and architect of this spectacular failure in containing the virus here in America.  I always thought she was suspect based on her performances in the news conferences and seeming desire to self promote.  She is obviously in over her head and has turned into a yes woman for Trump which has had disastrous consequences as the virus is clearly out of control in this country.  

A vaccine can't come soon enough and I fear this is the only thing that is going to rescue this dumpster fire.  I'm really disappointed in Dr. Birx most of all.  She is also apparently behind the shifting of the data from the CDC to HHS and whatever she is doing with the data is not working based on the explosion in cases."
2020-07-19 08:03:54,"Trump and his administration are delinquents. Donald wants power but cares for none of the responsibility that comes with it. Despite his ignorance, however, his petulance emboldens him, regardless of his ineptitude. Lucky for him, his narcissism does provide him the ability to care for himself and his image, but that’s about all.

I’ve always known this administration was an atomic bomb being ridden by a cartoon, but I still don’t comprehend why some people fail to see it? For Trump’s staff to suggest, embarrassing a governor, who is concerned about and trying to save the citizens of his state, instead of showing absolute compassion and solidarity for fellow Americans, is proof enough that the reptilian inhabitants of the White House don’t care about people anymore than COVID-19 does.

Of all I’ve seen I ask myself, how could anyone look to Trump for leadership? It took the man, in the midst of a respiratory disease pandemic, almost 7 months to don a mask, despite the fact that the people who come in contact with him need to be tested before having an audience with him. If this doesn’t exhibit conceit, selfishness, and a disregard for fellow American’s, then what does? There is something fatally wrong in a republic where such an egocentric personality can win and maintain a position of such importance with ardent support and unabashed conviction."
2020-07-19 10:23:03,"I gues some folks have a really short memory. Anyone recall when Trump had wanted to re-open the entire country by Easter?
What was the reaction from Democrats and the media?
How dare he.  He doesn’t have the power.  Trump is not king.  
Trump didn’t have the power to close states, and doesn’t have it to re-open them. 
Democrats wanted the power.  They have it. They went unhinged when Trump tried to declare he had the power. 
And now you’re complaining about it, and trying to shuffle the blame back to the President?"
2020-07-19 05:17:33,"The Repub administration is handcuffed and blinded by confirmation bias. Thats the need to only listen to info that supports your ideas. We are all victims of this and one reason FOX  is so popular, they tell their audience what they  want to hear only,

Its a dangerous way to live but with a death risk for millions its a catastrophe.

Trump is well known for this and his staff know it. Only tell him what he wants to hear.

No one will say the ""emperor is naked""."
2020-07-18 22:17:27,"The president failed because he didn’t try. He doesn’t care what happens to Americans.  He always put himself first, us last and he thought his best interest lie is downplaying the threat, turfing the problem to the states, and blaming others as needed. 

Even though he is stupid and inexperienced, Trump could have done okay if he had tried.  If he had cared enough to try."
2020-07-19 04:22:37,"Here's a field-tested ""model"" that closely mimics the Trump-inflicted pandemic disaster: Birx and others in the West Wing thought of scattered Covid-19 outbreaks as ""embers"" that could be easily extinguished. Right--like embers of the Camp Fire in Paradise, California. 

As Trump continues actively to disrupt-or should one say sabotage?--efforts to battle the pandemic, we the people need to be more vocal in demanding his immediate resignation and in condemning the cowardice of his enablers in Congress and elsewhere in government."

They are as much to blame as Trump. They could have stopped this madness anytime. We can only conclude they are at least as bad as Trump."
2020-07-19 10:43:52,"Trump approaches every issue in terms of how it could affect his chances of re-election. From foreign policy issues to Black Lives Matter his words and decisions are those of Candidate Trump. He has never become President Trump
In the UK we have the same issue - a government that acts as though an election is imminent even though its 4.5 years away. We have reached the era of permanent campaigning.
At least the (female) leaders of Germany and New Zealand have shown that it's still possible to govern and manage a crisis in the age of social media as opposed to constantly act as if an election was taking place"
2020-07-19 11:05:20,"Trump's response to this crisis is no surprise. It's exactly what you'd expect to happen, if you put a mafia boss in charge of the Government (although I'd expect most mob bosses to have more common sense than Trump does). Republicans should be howling for his resignation. But, as usual, he suffers no real consequences and remains in power. That the corruption runs so deep in the party is what's really astounding. And so unbelievably disappointing."

2020-07-19 09:28:52,Food for thought:  Calling the covid-19 response Trump's failure presumes that Trump wanted to defeat covid-19.  There's no evidence that Trump ever wanted that.
2020-07-19 09:53:29,"There are a couple of rules that must be followed when drawing conclusions and making policy decisions: 

1.  if you want something too badly, you should require much more evidence (especially to the contrary) than usual to support your position (to counteract bias), and 

2.  evidence for something new, surprising, or profound requires there to be much more of it and for it to be of higher quality.  

The administration (and its advisors, like Dr. Birx) violated both, time and again.  

They wanted the need for lockdowns to be over, so they jumped on all evidence that supported their hopes.    Surprising ""cures"" were pushed and adopted the moment someone suggested that they have worked elsewhere on other diseases.     

You can't hope to win this deadly game by turning off the scoreboard, by ignoring what the other team (the virus) is doing, and by wishful (self-serving) thinking.  

You need facts, more facts, and the best facts.  That's the sort of thing this president should be able to get behind."
2020-07-19 08:19:44,"I'm not old enough to remember the Iraq war. But when I grew up, the word 'America' inspired some sort of admiration or fascination for a country that seemed so cool and progressive. Now, I look on in pity, for all of the sensible, intelligent, kind citizens of America who are witnessing what is happening to their country. I'll never understand the Trump supporters, but I fervently hope that you'll secure some leadership that will bring back what we thought you had."
2020-07-19 10:55:41,"At the outset of the pandemic, Trump called himself a ""war president."" The number of deaths from coronavirus has now surpassed American deaths in Viet Nam or WWI--indeed, in every war except the Civil War and WWII. Trump has been a war president, alright, but his war has been against his own people. The blood of tens of thousands of Americans are on his hands, and those of the irresponsible fantasists around him who have refused to take responsibility for the worst, most deadly, policy failure in American history."
2020-07-19 02:36:51,"None of this should be surprising.
Look at how Trump ran his businesses: they all failed, he was sloppy and argumentative, lied and lied and lied about everything, hurt anyone who crossed his path, threatened and filed lawsuits, looked for scapegoats, and escaped w money.
It’s how he’s been running the country.
But remember: anyone who wants a test can get a test, and anyway, this will all be gone by April - like a miracle."
2020-07-19 02:57:46,"Donald Trump is first and foremost and someone who wants his own way and he tries to “sell” people on giving it to hIm. He will tell people want they want to hear - it’s a hoax, fake news, and on and on, to “make the sale” which results in him getting what he wants - on this case votes. What’s more scary is that there are so many people who actually want to hear what he has to say and support him. P.T. Barnum, or whoever made the quote about suckers, is entirely vindicated."
2020-07-19 10:14:43,"It may finally be becoming apparent to Republicans that they have made a massive mistake in permitting Trump to capture their party and govern as a ""personalismo"" banana republic republic dictator. It will take a generation to rebuild a competent Republican party even if it is possible. In the meantime, the US is cooked as a global political leader and ruined financially  because the oligarchs looted the country's productive capacity that prevents it from even making the PPE required to save itself."
2020-07-19 10:15:49,"The only thing Trump cares about is getting re-elected.  He will make any sacrifice for this goal. In 2016,  For example, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, hired Mr. Stepien onto the Trump campaign.  Mr. Stephen now leads the Trump campaign.  He used to work for Chris Christie,  Chris Christie once put Jared Kushner’s dad in prison. Jared Kushner had Chris Christie ostracized from any cabinet position.  The Trump team is imploding. ."
2020-07-19 02:10:37,"If the nation at large had followed New York State, or countries like Italy, Spain, Germany, or even China we would be starting to go about our normal lives. Instead, we’re opting for catastrophic health care system break downs, countless lives lost, and deep economic disruption. Things would be quite different today had trump not dithered early in the year and not been mindlessly reckless before that! The nation was left vulnerable and in  ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" mode as he deliberately dismantled important measures of the previous administration that successfully protected the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and an infrastructure to guard against other future infection situations. There would have been fully supplied, certified and operating testing facilities in place and functioning (they still aren’t). The virus catastrophe could have been effectively contained (as Ebola was), and perhaps even largely avoided. When asked about this by a reporter trump, brushed it off as “a nasty question"". This president has deliberately put millions in mortal peril. This president has blood on his hands, no question."
2020-07-19 03:28:22,"What do Americans expect? Trump ran as no one else had. He's running the federal government as no on else had. The only shock was his improbable victory that leaves us in our sorry state. I now fully expect Republicans to throw in the towel, financially limit the future federal response and dump the whole mess on Biden. When, of course, they will be of no help at all."
2020-07-19 10:10:35,"How any normal adult in America that has been paying attention to this health crisis can still support trump is beyond me.  As I see it he has failed on every level and should be removed from office today if not sooner.  I hope America survives trump as it is commonly known that ""Everything trump touches dies""."
2020-07-19 03:17:07,"This depressing information about reckless negligence by those who are charged with ensuring our health and welfare - I feel ill after reading it. But I know it is true, and I wonder if any of these Administration personnel will ever have to officially answer for their cavalier and very flawed approach to addressing the pandemic. So many families devastated, so many Americans dead, and no end in sight. This is a catastrophe that could have been prevented. SHAME!"
2020-07-19 07:58:02,"In Britain when we strike off an incompetent or dishonest physician, the charge is often one of ""bringing the profession into disrepute."" 

That is exactly what Dr Birx has done during this pandemic. It was painfully obvious from the earliest briefings that she was putting politics ahead of the science. That she was a Republican first and a doctor second.

No doubt the Trump administration will eventually turn and try to blame her, as it has already done with the CDC and its director Robert Redfield. 

But the flaws that make Redfield and Birx such deficient guardians of public health were the very qualities that made the Trump administration choose them. Liberal science groups begged Trump not to appoint Redfield, calling him a disaster waiting to happen. His only obvious qualification was his extreme religious conservatism -- which is a qualification only to the US Republican party. 

When you appoint bad scientists because you don't like good ones or can't handle the truths they're telling you, you don't get to complain later that your scientists misled you."
2020-07-19 11:05:10,"How short our memories are. Anything to criticize Trump.
I’m no fan of this President. He did not receive my vote in ‘16 and he will not receive it this November.
But the rhetoric spewed here and other liberal media that he pushed responsibility To the states for dealing with Corona In the beginning of the crisis is flat out incorrect. He actually tried to strong arm control from the states in the beginning before running afoul of the 10th amendment.
He’s provided more than enough material to run him out of office but this issue is not one of them."

2020-07-19 03:52:08,"Have we as a nation lost all sense of proportion?

(All figures approx)
We lost 52,000 lives in the Vietnam War - one that lasted from the early sixties to the mid seventies. We incurred the significant beginnings of our National Debt and we found out later that the premise of this war (Domino Theory) was a mistake. 

Fast forward to 9/11 and the Afghanistan & Iraq wars lasting 20 years plus. Not only did we lose (let’s say) 10,000 lives we piled on debt. Going into the Trump inauguration, out-standings stood at 18trillion. The Iraq war was a mistake and the jury is out on the Afghanistan war. 

Enter Trump with promises of MAGA and the economy going to be his strong point. He like other presidents took an oath to protect us Americans. As a businessman he would drain the swamp etc etc. Results: The debt went from 18 trillion to 23 trillion in his first 3 years But the kicker in the fourth year of his administration is the catastrophic handling of our public health crisis. Not only have we lost 140,000 souls and counting, we have added at least 6 trillion more to the debt i.e. spent 12 trillion in 4 years. Not only has he failed to keep his promises re the economy, we have in Trump’s admin alone lost more lives due to his bungling than in all the previous wars listed - and those were during multiple administrations. 

Does anyone in their right minds think that Trump deserves re-election?"
2020-07-19 03:55:48,"It was always about the politics for them--optics, who looks good and who doesn't, affirming their standing with their base and not inconveniencing business--as usual. As for the deaths, the grief, the suffering: not important.  It appears they could not have cared less. And they still do not care. Its murderous."
2020-07-19 11:07:59,Trump has been unfit for office from day one. He is a science denier and he refuses to listen to anyone. He has put people in positions who will only tell him what he wants to hear. It is no surprise that we are in this horrific mess. When he was elected I was fearful of a disaster because I believed he would not be able to handle it. I feared this disaster would probably come in the form of a nuclear confrontation and never considered a pandemic. Hopefully this nightmare will end in November but what a mess we will have to clean up after.
2020-07-19 02:59:27,"I would place the roots of failure much earlier to when the WHO warned leaders to prepare for a pandemic.  I believe it was early to mid-February.  We prepared nothing.  No masks, no shields, worst of all, no tests.  Republicans including Trump called it a hoax, no worse than the flu.  The roots of failure were there from the start.  Trump made no effort to lead."
2020-07-19 04:03:21,"Thanks for this in-depth analysis and explanation. The botched federal response now makes sense to me, even though it was a failure of epic proportions. It would be further helpful to have plots of death rates and other statistics to compare outcomes of US to other countries.

Thanks again for this great article. These are the articles for which I pay the subscription to NYT."
2020-07-19 05:28:10,"This was an excellent piece of journalism that documented the abject failures of national leadership by Trump’s administration.  First, there was the failure by Trump to acknowledge at an early stage the emerging pandemic threat.  Second, Trump did not marshal medical and economic experts to formulate and implement sound mitigation efforts on a national footing.  Our 50 states were each left on their own for developing policies on face mask wearing, social distancing, testing/tracing, and shut down/reopening strategies.  So now our nation is a sad patchwork of many states facing infection rates that are accelerating again.  As a result, we are currently faced with over 140,000 deaths and an economic crises worse than the recent Great Recession.  Truly, our current POTUS does not understand the meaning of the word “United” as in “The United States of America”.  Nor does Trump exhibit empathy for the victims of this national catastrophe.  Trump’s only concerns are politics and staying in power.  I fervently hope that the majority of voters will recall this current nightmare and vote Trump out this November.  Maybe then can the nightmare start to fade and the healing can begin for our nation."
2020-07-19 05:30:30,"""But even as the president was acknowledging the need for tough decisions, he and his aides would soon be looking to do the opposite — build a public case that the federal government had completed its job and unshackle the president from ownership of the response.”

Mr. Trump is not going to change.  And even though “Jared Kushner believes that this is not something that the White House should get too involved in” (please hold your laughter), here in the real world we can’t wait until January for leadership when we’re already under water.  Mr. Trump needs to resign, or be escorted out, right now."
2020-07-19 10:37:59,"I find it remarkable that Trump and his cronies cannot be held criminally responsible for their actions. Maybe not so much what is described in this article, which chronicles unbelievable ignorance and incompetence and touches on the vicious malice that motivates Trump and his immediate family, notably Kushner. But moreso on the efforts to cut funding for testing and actively pursuing policies and actions that are guaranteed to kill thousands of Americans? At what point does gross incompetence become deliberate negligence and criminally liable behavior?"
2020-07-19 05:24:02,"This is the success of the Trump presidency. It’s what he promised - unpredictability, chaos, the dismantling of the administrative state as per S. Banon. It’s what the voters said they wanted. It was all well and good when Trump could scare the latest perceived enemy with the threat of a nasty tweet. Well, the virus doesn’t care about tweets. The virus cares less for the well being of humans than Mr. Trump. The virus uses and bends people to its will in ways that even Trump could not imagine. I always thought Putin totally manipulated Trump. That Putin was too smart to allow collusion with Trump - collusion implies partnership; Trump was better used as a patsy to manipulate. The virus has them both outsmarted. The difference is that the virus has no ego. It wants no thanks. It does not care about revenge. It does not care about the glory of the Soviet state or the idealised 1950’s America. I have made my will. I’m stocking up on essentials. I’m donating to food banks and to organisations supporting struggling families and our first responders and hospital workers. And to anyone trying to defeat Trump and McConnell. I am confident that both Trump and the virus can be defeated. I am not so confident that I will live to see both those things happen."
2020-07-19 03:11:25,"Mark Meadows was right about one thing. “Only in Washington, D.C., do they think that they have the answer for all of America.”   He was referring I’m sure to Democrats. But it was the Trump administration he unwittingly referred to. 

Trump’s instincts are often wrong. From masks to testing he’s proved an inability to deal with reality, meaning science.  ‘Unteachable’ is a term used to describe Trump very accurately. 

Now Trump’s Washington is deferring to the states an incomplete, haphazard, and anti-science message; you’re on your own.  Some states fortunately are responding intelligently by enforcing the only weapons currently at hand; masks, distancing, and sanitizing.  Others like Georgia are so entwined with Trump-think the governor is refusing to permit local officials to mandate masks.  It doesn’t get more bizarre than this. 

As long as Trump is in charge, his wishful thinking and failure to act will only harm people and consequently the economy. Sick people can’t work. Dead people don’t buy.  The numbers are bad and getting worse so Trump’s response is to bury the statistics.  Wishful thinking again. 

We need more testing and timely results. PPEs for first responders and the public. But Trump is against spending more on testing. He thinks more tests are the reason the virus spreads. He actually said that. As if I don’t check my house for termites, I have no termites.  This is not the thinking of a rational person."
2020-07-19 03:33:04,"The arrogance, willful ignorance and total abandonment of responsibility of this administration has doomed us. Kushner is without security clearance, brains or empathy. The impenetrable bubble in which these trump enablers live has caused hundreds and hundreds of deaths. Trump has been open about not taking responsibility for his administration’s many failure and now we know why:  he never wanted it in the first place. That a little more than a third of people polled still believe trump is beyond my comprehension. Each day that passes of this nightmare in which we are living is one day less of this terrible person, his immoral advisers, including those in his family and his feckless enablers."
2020-07-19 08:18:13,"..., from afar, one is concerned that the United States will never come back to an aligned recognition of what truth is - and as such the nation will forever be divided, and thus not capable of accepting global leadership charters. 

Other nations will move on, and move in."
2020-07-19 10:19:52,"All this and it's not over. If we do nothing my prediction is two million deaths. 

Okay, so we tried dumping on Fauci but it didn't take. Now we jump on the bandwagon of blaming Birx. If somehow she survives this we will jump to another scapegoat. And another. 

This article tells me that the hit jobs are being directed by Mark Meadows and obviously, by Trump himself with input from Kushner of course. 

Next thing we know, Meadows will be to blame. We'll get ten sources form withing the government saying it was him ( and Mick Mulvaney). 

The problem is, the real responsibility lies squarely at the foot of Trump ( and Pence too) and we are doomed to continue failing as long as he is in charge. 

In a selfless act of patriotism, Trump and Pence need to resign."
2020-07-19 02:15:57,"RE: Failure of Trump (and Pence)

The utter catastrophe of the US pandemic response, including death and suffering and colossal economic damage and destruction—

Should require the removal from office, NOW, of Trump and Pence. We are in dire crisis now; we can’t wait until November.

Senate Republicans, give the signal to the House that it’s time to remove Trump and Pence, and it can be done quickly.

Yes, it’s time for our first woman president, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House. And she will only serve six months, until January 20. But it will break the ice for a woman president, and most importantly allow the United States of America to recover with science and rational thinking and executive branch competence."
2020-07-19 02:31:47,"Two points:
1)  Everybody makes mistakes.  It's better not to make mistakes, but they'll happen anyway.  What matters is that you are able to acknowledge your mistakes, learn from them, and correct them.  What matters is that you have a disciplined decision-making process designed to minimize mistakes.

Donald Trump is consistently unwilling to admit error, is incapable of learning, and is too stubborn to change course.  He relies on his gut rather than data for decision-making, and his chaotic personnel management prevents other people from shoring up his weaknesses.

2)  That said, even if Trump did everything else wrong, he could have easily mitigated the severity of the pandemic just by consistently modeling mask-wearing.  If, starting in March, he wore a mask and encouraged his followers to do the same, then we might already be on the road to recovery.

The only downside is that the mask would smear his makeup."
2020-07-19 08:44:26,"There were days (before this pandemic happened) where out of nowhere it would suddenly strike me that tens of millions of people actually trusted this con man enough to put him in our nation's highest office. 

In those days, I'd shake my head and think about the damage done and at least be content with the fact that we'd probably get him out of office before a nationwide catastrophe would happen.

Well, we're here. And we've gotten exactly what we bargained for by putting this excuse of a leader in the White House. I can only hope that we don't make that mistake again but seeing the way some Americans around this country refuse to act with basic human decency, history may repeat itself in November and the demise of this country will be complete."
2020-07-19 10:44:29,"The mess we are in is much due to the irresponsibility of many, not just one. Too many people don’t take this thing seriously, especially the young. And why is that? It is, IMO, because they have not seen death up close and personal and so have no respect for it. I watched my older brother being buried at 15 (he was 29 , his only child was born two months later). It had a profound effect, still does, because you instantly realize bad things do happen and there is no recovery. Death is forever, at least until the resurrection."
2020-07-19 10:49:04,A healthy economy requires healthy employers and employees.  The small company I work for in WV understands this concept and has taken appropriate action...so far we are faring pretty well.  This is what happens when you have people pretending to lead. They are dangerous as a result of their incompetency. Trump has absolutely no interest in doing any of the hard work necessary to leading. And the person surrounding him are just as bad.  Vote them all out in November.
2020-07-19 11:14:48,"In a way, Trump admits he needs to be reelected only to protect his own and personal interests. His scorched earth policy leads only to one thing, the chaos. The current health crisis is just a snapshot of what he would offer to the US and the rest of the world, if he was able to stay (legally or not) in the office."
2020-07-19 03:39:02,"From a Canadian perspective—especially from a place that has done an exceptional job in containment—this has been obvious from the start when he punted responsibility to the states to wipe his hands of any responsibilities, as he directly proclaimed. Even more so now with the refusal to find contact tracing, being anti-mask, and creating events that flaunt physical distancing. It’s horrifying to see what’s going on in my homeland. Horrifying. It doesn’t need to be this way, and I hope enough people realize that to get them to the polls in November."
2020-07-19 10:23:35,"To understand that half the country are *still* seriously questioning whether they should be wearing masks, just visit the Foxnews website. 

Ultimately, that is what public health in the USA is up against. Just as many people will *never* admit they made a mistake in voting for Trump in the first place, nor will they ever admit they were wrong and back down over the masks issue. Hyper-partisan tribalism will doom the US to a completely unnecessary and lingering Covid-19 agony.

The die was cast the moment Trump decided to politicize the pandemic. That is, from Day 1."
2020-07-19 02:59:56,"It's not like this was difficult rocket science.  Laymen standing on the sidelines (like me) could see a train wreck coming, and I think most people who were not focused first on the economy/re-election saw it coming.  A gross failure of leadership and an extremely negligent mis-allocation of priorities (economy/re-election over health and safety).  Ironically, the economy could be way better off now if the virus had first been gotten under control."
2020-07-19 03:38:23,"Per President Trump, the case count goes up with more testing, and this looks bad, so cut the funding for testing. Apparently, it’s okay for people to wait six or seven hours to be tested and then wait another seven or eight days to get their test results. But, this also looks bad. The only logical way out of this dilemma, before a vaccine is available, is to reduce the number of cases by increasing testing, contact tracing, and isolation of infected people. President Trump does not grasp this, thus Trump’s failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-07-19 10:40:12,"Trump is the kid who takes the ball and goes home, if the game isn't going his way. He looks for quick spectacular results, preferably before national cameras. An earlier equally impetuous President declared victory, left with work unfinished and a country in ruins , in order to rush off to another totally unnecessary and quite unrelated war elsewhere, whose after-effects linger. The health crisis requires steady hands, nimble feet and commitment for the long haul. To manage 2 equally important warfronts requires a delicate balancing of data from both fronts, and a war room where the teams work in tandem, adjusting and readjusting strategies as need arises. In short, it needs a wartime President with a plan, who accepts that the buck stops with him. Not someone from the Apprentice whose only line was ""You're fired!"""
2020-07-19 03:11:16,"It should be noted that the constant drumbeat from the administration's media support - fox et al, contributed heavily to the public disregard for masks and social distancing. These same featured many stories that supported Trump's desire for ""liberation"" and prompted several groups of armed demonstrators to invade state houses. Trump added fuel to those fires with attacks , mostly targeting democratic governors."
2020-07-19 08:49:14,"Surely the point is that Trump should not be there. There has been ample evidence, often outlined in the columns of the NYT, that he is not an appropriate person to lead the USA. It has always been clear that if there was a disaster - a war, an earthquake in California, a pandemic - then Trump could not be trusted to lead a response that would minimize damage and enable restoration. It was known that he and his administration were reducing the resilience of the nation. As a foreigner, I always assumed that the US had checks and balances to protect it from a dangerous President. The most important question, it seems to me, is why have they failed?"
2020-07-19 10:42:57,"Let's not cast too much blame on Dr. Birx.
She is only following the examples of the Republican Senators who are too afraid of losing their positions.
She has learned from all the others who have chosen to differ from the president what happens.  They lose their positions.
She has learned from the Democratic governors what happens when the express the truth.  No supplies.  
She has learned she would rather keep her influence than express the truth.  Power."
2020-07-19 03:37:30,"It’s abundantly clear that Trump has thrown in the towel. He quit. Walked away. The COVID challenge demanded a strong leader. One blessed with intelligence, perseverance, selfless dedication to those he promised to serve. I know it’s a tired and overused axiom, but it is appropriate at this time: When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Trump has run away. He knows better than anyone that the solution to this crisis is beyond him."
2020-07-19 02:38:04,"Much of the problem is Trump's absolute refusal to ever take responsibility.  On multiple occasions, he has said, ""I am not responsible"" when there has been a problem.  His aversion is  shown by after asseting total power, a few days later he passed it off to the governors.  That way, he could claim credit for success and avoid responsibility for failure."
2020-07-19 02:42:30,"It is quite ironic to see Republicans relying on science to save them, ie a vaccine when they claim to not believe in other science. And they are all about states rights when it is about abdicating responsibilities, but not when states wish to do positive things for their citizens."
2020-07-19 03:22:22,"No doubt Trump is incompetent and unfit for office.  

However, I am very disappointed with Dr. Birx.  I thought she would follow the science more rather than a be a cheerleader for reopening the country too soon.

Some may call her White House survival great political instincts, I think she is a Trump sell out, much to the detriment of the country."
2020-07-19 05:07:46,"Trump is impeding this country’s efforts to minimize the bad effects of the pandemic. He cannot fulfill the role of the President in these efforts both because it requires leadership and it requires unifying the country about common problem and because it requires big government to do what it exists to do. He can’t lead because he’s a solo act. His political power and all of his messages depend upon division and fear and loathing and anti-government attitudes. Doing the right thing is too hard for him personally and harmful to him politically. Yet, the pandemic is doing him politically harm so he has to find a way to mitigate it. Denial might work if the damage is not realized until after the election."
2020-07-19 10:35:38,"Ultimately, in order to overcome the virus, the US is going to have to implement a comprehensive and lengthy lockdown. When that happens we will be doubly disadvantaged because we will be doing it alone and out-of-sync with the rest of the world. They will be opening while we are closing and, by the time we open, we will be behind. 

All in all I would say Mr. Trump was right in his prediction: I am tired of this kind of winning."
2020-07-19 01:53:36,"It defies belief that we have a President of the United States plus his admin that did not and still does not take this pandemic seriously. 

The Republican Party, better known as the Party of Trump, remains joined with Trump despite the huge and growing toll of devastation and death that Trump has encouraged across our nation. Trump has actively encouraged us all to pay no attention to it. Will he be held accountable And when? 

With Trump’s willful ignorance and mismanagement, how are we to survive to Election Day, let alone Inauguration Day? Trump is neither serious, competent, nor well-intentioned. He has shown total disregard for his oath of office."
2020-07-19 10:02:35,"The president provided quick and decisive leadership until the state governments had time to assume the responsibilities they are supposed to be accountable for.  The president immediately banned foreign travel from the country of origin.  He established a coordinating, strong task force to ensure equipment, supplies and doctors were made available.  He pushed providing funding for those that couldn't work then signed the bill when Congress finally passed it.  He provided doctors and hospital facilities from the military.  He immediately established programs to quickly identify and safely develop a vaccine.  He has shown way more leadership than Obama or Biden during the Flu Pandemic of 2009.  However, the media is loathe to give him credit for these accomplishments due to their particular agendas.  Shame on them - and thank you President Trump."

Republican small government crippled our pandemic response by denying us a federal central command to coordinate the flow of information and resources and by denying us a universal healthcare delivery system. 

Republican science denial crippled universal compliance with proven safety measures. By weaponizing ignorance they stifled innovation at the national level. 

Republican theories of an imperial executive gave the inadequate Trump absolute authority. 

Trump took exactly the leadership role envisioned by his Republican enablers. And took our nation over a cliff.

Whatever success we've had is because of governors and experts working around Republican intransigence."

They have elected themselves a president who is totally unfit for the office, is a criminal, and violates the law. He is not alone. Each and every member of the Senate who kept this man in his position, is equally guilty of destroying the democracy. Trump paves the way for similar presidents to come.

It's clear that the only way to the right thing is a new administration, which means six more months of uncertainty and fear,  illness, death, hunger, unemployment, spreading swaths of economic ruin, worsening depression and anxiety, worsening family violence, increased substance abuse ...

The tragedy in this case is that trump and his enablers either did not know this or chose to ignore scientific reality and that negligence has led to the deaths of over 130,000 Americans and growing.

2020-07-19 10:55:00,"I see it differently.  The White House recognized the problem early, given the travel bans which even the WHO and others, like Joe Biden, did not support.  As it became clear the US stockpile of medical equipment including PPE and ventilators was woefully inadequate as a resolute of years of neglect for pandemic preparation, the Administration clearly worked hard to move forward preparedness in a world wide marketplace competing for the same equipment.  As the curve bent, the Administration encouraged the opening of the economy as it originally planned, recognizing that hot spots would develop and such would be addressed as they arrived. The Administration recognized the dire human and economic effects of shout down in March/ April. The administration never set out to “contain” the virus, but, simply slow the spread as much as possible.

The administration didn’t count on four states, NY, NJ, Connecticut and Massachusetts sending sick,people into nursing homes...these Democrat governors, against CDC recommendations, enabled the death of about half of the US total death toll so far in nursing homes in those states. shameful.

The administration also didn’t count of the many Democrat governors and political leaders deciding that keeping the country shut down was a favorable political move or on the same leaders encouraging rioting in the streets of their states and cities and endorsing the anti-American Marxist goals of various protestors."

From the outset, as I watched these Task Force briefings, I found Dr. Birx’s comments confusing.  Sometimes she was hard as nails driving home data based recommendations. Other times she seemed to waffle horribly. But I must say,  my reaction to the comments of other members of the Task Force like Azar, Adams, and Redfield, who are in extraordinarily important government positions, even more astonishing.  Over time their comments appeared to be blatantly misleading. I won’t even begin to try to analyze the commentary offered by the head of the Task Force, Vice President Pence. (The one consistent voice was Dr. Fauci). Yet each of these individuals walk away from the critiques with a pass and Dr. Birx is the “fall guy.”  There is plenty of blame for this debacle of a task force to go around but only targeting Dr. Birx appears one-sided.

2020-07-19 11:03:00,"Trump famously said that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose support among his base.  Here's what else he could do and not lose support: commit treason; wage economic warfare on American workers, the middle class and the poor; destroy the environment; deprive as many Americans as he can of their health insurance and health care; wage war on women's reproductive rights; tell lies; be a racist, a misogynist, an anti-Semite and Islamaphobe; wage war onLGBTQ rights; sell out our allies on the battlefield and alienate our allies in NATO; undermine and attack democracy abroad and here at home; deprive Americans of their First Amendment right to protest through heavy-handed, violent and brutal federal law-enforcement oppression; and, now, allow the nation to succumb to a pandemic with the loss of upwards of 120 thousand lives and counting - many of which lives could have been saved.  With consistency like this, it's hard to view Trump's handling of the pandemic as a ""failure,"" because that presupposes an intention on his part to do something good for the United States.  It would probably be more accurate - and honest - to describe the toll the pandemic is taking on our nation as another in a long line of Trump's achievements."
2020-07-19 03:17:28,"Trump's failure to take responsibility for the coronavirus pandemia was not only a product of his incompetence, but his complete indifference to it's consequences. In retrospect, not surprising, given that Trump is unable to feel empathy  towards the suffering of the very people he swore to protect, now already with 140,000 deaths under his belt...and counting. Now, to add insult to injury, he is trying to ignore this pandemia, still hoping it will disappear by magic...while he remains adamant, full throttle, in his cmapaign to re-assault the presidency again come November.

Trump is not alone in his Marie Antoinette Let Them Eat Cake reality show. The so called Red States who really think they are a country of their own are taking the brunt of the Virus and nobody really seems to care. It is like The Climate Denial play they have been playing for years. Is there something in the DNA or the water that Republicans drink that makes them think if you don't talk about something it just goes away? While Trump and family are hustling Goya Beans people are dying. You don't have to be a Rocket Scientist to know Trump would not send his kids to any of the schools he is insisting on opening. Nero Fiddled While Rome Burned. Trump and his BFF Graham played the back Nine while Americans died. Sometimes you have to wonder if Trump and his supporters deserve each other. In November we need to put caution to the wind and save Trump and his supporters from each other. Talk about a dysfunctional family! I don't think there is therapist couch big enough for all of these folks. Myself and people who I know who read Trump's nieces book all to a person said there was nothing new in what she was saying about Uncle Don we didn't already know. Donald Trump is an open book.

Because those three states accounted for the vast majority of early infections and deaths, their ability to bend the curve painted a rosy picture of the country as a whole. Researchers and reporters began analyzing data by state. Those state graphs told a very different story than Dr. Brix was peddling.

If Donald Trump had watched the regular news conferences of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, California Governor Gavin Newsome, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, he would have known that he was making a dangerous political mistake. Instead, he stayed in the Fox News echo chamber after spending three plus years getting rid of anyone who would speak truth to power. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

We are approaching 140,000 Trump Deaths. We should never forget that those deaths could have been avoided with presidential leadership. Germany, New Zealand, and South Korea did it. We failed.

We didn’t have enough masks for our hospitals so we told people that they didn’t to wear them. It would have been so straightforward to say “If you leave home, wear a mask.”

Maybe we need a State Healthcare Compact or a new administration in the White House to finally bend the curve."

And his rallies have turned into “super spreader” events because his followers refuse safety precautions like masks and scream for My Rights and Freedom nonsense.   And his golfing trips have devolved into paying massive amounts of fees to Trump Resorts for hotel and golf cart fees.

For at least April and May, it pretty much lays it at the feet of Dr. Birx giving plausible deniability to Trump.  It also better explains why Conservatives believed it was not a big problem for most of the country.  Certainly the article almost totally blames Trump as the virus began to spread and for where we find ourselves now.

Knowing who Trump is, I find it hard to believe he followed any science in his decisions.  Rather he was always focused on what he thought would benefit his reelection -- opening up the economy -- deaths and disability be dammed."
2020-07-19 05:25:36,"Trump is still using his “Slow Down the Testing” plan to hide the true numbers of virus cases in America.   Trump’s devious new strategy works like this:  1) strip-out any funds allocated by Congress for virual tests,   2) make it so the virus kits will be in short supply and states will not be able to test rising new viruses loads,  and.  3) once the virus testing has slowed down because of lack of kits, it will look like the virus cases are decreasing.

The other part of Trump’s plan to hide the number of virus cases is to “massage the records” now coming from hospitals directly, skipping over the CDC, so they can be made to look more favorable for this Whitehouse.    Also, Jared is still busy at mismanaging the distribution and procurement of our national stockpiles of tests kits and PPE equipment, so that can also still be used to manipulate governors and state officials to do what this Whitehouse wants."

2020-07-19 11:21:13,"What a leadership disaster.

Delegate everything especially responsibility then undermine the efforts of the ones which you delegated the duties while maintaining total authority at the top. Make sure you get your quid pro quo praise for allocating your substantial resources.

Set rules then undermine compliance to those rules. Refuse to set an example. Give everybody a rational not to follow the rules. Set a negative tone at the top to following the guidelines.

Seek to undermine the CDC and Centers for Disease Control then wonder why people are ignoring the guidelines. Secretly have non -medical staff overruling doctors and epidemiologists on guidelines. This of course causes everyone to be unsure of the guidance.

Tout drug treatments and vaccines that create a false sense of hope. Also establish implementation timeframes that have never been achieved before.

Implement State and local decision making when you know you can not band travel.

The virus just started on the east coast, it has now began its spread to the south and west. Instead of preparing, the south and west congratulated itself on its leadership and good fortune. 

Now it is their time to fight the virus. Bring on the overwhelmed doctors, nurses, and hospitals. Bring on the refrigerated trucks to serve as instant morgues.

That said, if it is a landslide and Dems take control of both Houses and the White House, Dems better be ready to pass lightning legislation, already haggled out, to not only address the above, but fix our shattered country (Look to Warren and Sanders). 

To truly do this, Dems will have to fall on their sword, and betray their masters en mass. 

Our gov is elected via a system of open legalized bribery where campaign donors become constituents, rather than voters. Dems need to ignore who donated to their campaign, and rebel against this entire corrupt system and enact a NEW campaign financing system that takes *campaign donations out of the equation entirely,* and puts ordinary citizens and America first – look to other countries for models that are tried and tested.     

The current system elected (albeit barely) the worst President in modern American history, prevented efforts to reign him in, turned the entire GOP party into humiliated sycophantic enablers, and saw *routine* overt abuses of power. This can never happen again, or the next Trump will worse.... 

Trump was a symptom of a busted system, and a dire warning. If the opportunity to fix our country arrives, Dems have a *moral mandate* to do so, and in short order.....

2020-07-19 11:18:05,"Trump owns this failure.  The sycophantic characters named in this story are accessories to that failure and to Trump's malfeasance. 

The handwriting was clearly on the wall back on March 26, when Dr. Birx said the following about Trump during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network:

""He’s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data. I think his ability to analyze and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.”

Birx's credibility withered and died at that moment, while irony was spinning in its grave."

Incorrect.  They were terrified of the reality, one which they had neither the will, the expertise, or the humility to face. So they did what our so-called ""leaders"" everywhere do when faced with a real emergency they had created through a combination of ignorance, laziness, and greed.   

They tried to shift the blame tp someone else, in this case, the states."

2020-07-19 11:30:27,"Even a casual observer could predict that we would wind up where we are now back in April. This is especially true after the administration put out reasonable and sensible guidelines for states to reopen and then within a week the President was eviscerating the governor of Michigan for not “freeing” her state, which would have violated his own guidelines. 

But then again this response could have been predicted the day after the election in 2016 when a majority of Americans voted against him due to his anticipated lack of fitness for office. We knew he would not handle a crises rationally.  Doing so requires a long term plan and the ability to lead people through a difficult journey that they don’t want to go through, for their own good. Stamina, fortitude and leadership skills: none of which he or his administration have.

He said it himself. He needs no briefings or long term policy papers to read. He just watches Fox News in the morning (which he apparently does all day) and then decides what to do that day because, as he said, “each day is like a new episode in a TV series”.

Well I for one can’t wait for this series to be cancelled in November. And apparently the ratings for the last 4 months have been terrible!"
2020-07-19 11:33:20,"Will someone please tell trump that not wearing a mask is not “freedom of speech” it is “freedom of expression.”  Furthermore, can they also tell him that if people were mandated to wear wear masks, it could possibly result in him having huge, socially distanced stadium rallies in the future.

It was obvious that Trump and co were not going to use the shutdown to any good effect - that’s when they should’ve been getting the testing, contact tracing, and supply chain issues straightened out like dozens of other, competent governments did. But no, they just used it for grandstanding press conferences and political bomb-tossing. So you get all the economic carnage for no real benefit, other than unclogging the hospitals.

Further shutdowns would just deepen the economic pain. Trump cannot solve a problem; it’s not what he does. In the meantime, corporations and professionals around the world did an overnight transformation and now work from home will be permanent for many. This is a huge win across the board (except commercial real estate)."
2020-07-19 11:35:44,"I appreciate this article for revealing that the administration may have been duped by Dr. Brix’s incompetence, but let’s not ourselves be duped into believing that she is or was the problem. Sure Brix is guilty of an epic fail, but alarms have been sounding, and a ton of data has emerged daily - globally - revealing in no uncertain terms that the Covid virus is spreading unchecked where distancing and mask wearing measures are lax. Countless national and international medical and scientific experts have not only been willfully ignored by the Trump administration, they have been kneecapped and vilified. The Trump administration is guilty of consistent and calculated disdain for facts. Trump needs no help cherry picking, mishandling or distorting models. 

The job of a leader is to listen, gather information and lead. Dr. Brix was but one voice among a chorus us of others. That this pandemic yet requires significant behavioral modification (mask wearing and distancing) has been obvious to just about EVERYONE who is not bullishly distracted by political spin and wishful thinking. 

Trump is not a victim of misinformation, he is a complete failure - with blood on his hands that can ever be washed clean. Sure, scapegoat Dr. Brix; toss her under the buss. Birx’s failure offers Trump, his administration and his political cult zero cover for their own."

Trumpers don’t want to be de-briefed about true and worrisome data that ‘is only offered to make Trump look bad’!  And even if they did read it, they’d only scream it was ‘FAKE!’. Frustrating times."
2020-07-19 11:17:43,"This truly excellent article makes one wonder how much different the federal response would have been if the objective were to kill as many Americans as possible. Decline leadership. Call it a hoax. Ignore the science. Model not wearing a mask. Call for “liberation“ from healthy practices. Pit the states against each other for supplies. Hoard supplies. Demand less testing. Honestly, it’s hard to think of anything they left out.

It’s heartening that Dr. Birx was trying for a science-driven response, but even she seems to have fallen victim, as so many of us do, to politically-tinged wishful thinking. Science and politics are uncomfortable bedfellows. It is the job of the scientist to keep them separate."
2020-07-19 11:18:03,"A lack of White House leadership and the continued polarization of the nation along party lines, combined to bring us to this point.  We have suffered for decades with a cacophony of hate spewed forth on social media sites and news sites. Vitriol shores up distrust in leaders. Opinions masquerade as facts, and political agendas have triumphed over fact based decision making. Trump is a failure on the leadership question, no doubt. But the lack of civility and comity in discourse only serves to divide us. Pandemics do not care about politics, nor do viruses.    

Trump, et al, can help turn this around now by wearing masks in public at all times.  Dr. Birx needs to go and Dr. Fauci needs to be the point man in public. He has more respect than Trump or his minions."
2020-07-19 11:23:25,"It continues to astonish me that no influential person on the president’s staff realized this was an opportunity for Trump to be a hero. Any national calamity presents a leader with the chance to lead, to be the one person the population looks to for guidance. It wouldn’t have been hard. Trump could just have read a daily speech, written by someone else who actually had sense and empathy. (And since he, unlike Governor Cuomo, lacks these qualities completely, he could have done it with no paun to himself.) The country would have turned to him as the savior who could lead us out of this disaster, and his popularity would have soared. So easy!
That strategy would have had the incidental benefit of saving innumerable lives. Maybe even the economy, if the country were now on track for a safe reopening.
Why didn’t anyone see this for the political gift it could have been?"

We have fortunately been somewhat successful by treating the virus as a health rather than political issue, and our opposing political parties have cooperated during the pandemic. What Putin and other parties have tried to do - produce an America so hopelessly divided that it can’t respond to crises - seems to have been successful. I feel deeply sad, as a world without the US as the leading power is a far darker one."

McConnell owns this disaster as much as anyone in the White House does."

Republican rule always trends to catastrophe. This episode is what Republican small government and science denial - amplified by the authoritarian regime of a fool - look like in a pandemic.

Republicans crippled America's pandemic preparedness and response. They've corrupted our pandemic relief. They are incompetent to handle a sustainable recovery.

Our future is in our hands. We have a clear choice. The accelerating crises of Republican business as usual, or the sustainable progress of Democratic innovation."

Need I remind people that he used information from Putin to reach out via Rudy Giuliani to corrupt the president of Ukraine into strong arming him to open a phony investigation on Joe Biden?   He was impeached for that.

He was pandered to violent White Supremacists his entire time in office.

He had the duke of Lie, Steve Bannon, almost as great a liar as himself, as his consigliere for the first year.  Remember that nightmare?

Need also I remind all that he caused the country's longest ever shutdown over a few miles of border fence monies that for all intense and purposes has been squandered on a joke of a barrier that has already cost billions and billions and the cartels just cut holes in it (which was pre-warned they would do) and others scale it or just go around.   Non-Commissioned Coast Guard personnel had to go on food stamps during the shutdown.

And as of right this minute there are 143,000+ dead Americans as a direct result of this, the country's worst ever president."

This administration must be investigated for it's response to COVID-19, the killing of U.S. soldiers in Niger, the killing of U.S. soldiers by Saudi Arabian pilot trainees, the killing of Jamal Kashoggi and the bounties paid by Russia for the killing of U.S. soldiers.

Being responsible for even millions of deaths before this is over won’t mean anything to him, so doesn’t guide how he wields power. Those who haven’t dealt with this mental illness before are susceptible to gaslighting, because it’s so hard to grasp. Trump was elected resulting from 63 million Americans feeling abandoned over the last several decades as .all. the country’s wealth was siphoned to the few.  We, the country that defeated the Nazis, can decide to join the civilized world and fight for universal healthcare and a Green New Deal which will staunch the strip-mining of what’s left of our despairing middle class and honor our hardworking poor.

Trump has FAILED to do his duty.

He appears to have COMPLETELY removed himself from ANY responsibility for this stunning catastrophe.

Essentially, he has QUIT.  

The consequence for his FAILURE should be an indictment for criminal negligence in his conduct as President. 

The best that we apparently can hope for at this point is that he is rejected by an overwhelming vote AGAINST him on 03 November 2020.

What will the DEATH TOLL for Americans from this pandemic be on 03 November?

Do we as a nation have to endure this criminal negligence by Trump and his incompetent lackeys until 20 January 2021?

America is being wrecked by this narcissistic sociopath and the dishonest and deceitful buffoons surrounding him.

My conclusion is that we are going to be devastated by 20 January 2021.  

Does this catastrophe have to proceed until then?

- Blame the states, especially if they’re politically blue, extort them to open economies and schools before epidemiologically prudent, to express gratitude to me before I ship them urgent medical supplies.

As Mary Trump has analyzed of her sick uncle, he has unleashed his family’s extreme pathology on the nation as a whole. “Learned helplessness” is rampant among the WH personnel around around him, and among his enablers in the DOJ, State Department, Treasury, as well as in the institutions now hollowed out of any connective competence, sense of right/wrong, or patriotism.

When the WH policy people are focused on embarrassing political opponents rather than saving lives you can expect the results to be calamitous.  And talk about magical thinking:  Keeping Fauci off TV so he would not go off message and suggest continued high risk from the virus.  Did they think the virus watches Meet The Press?

- on 4th and long, QB Potus handed off to Running Back Governor who, with excellent protection from Offensive Linemen Lockdown and Socialdistancing, got a first down. 
- QB Potus then spiked the ball on his own 20-yard line and left the field, electing to go for an 80-yard field goal.
- Kicker Kushner is warming up on the sidelines for the field goal attempt, which is concerning as his longest successful attempt is 10 yards (wind-assisted).

As infuriating as it seemed to be for the people around him, it also seemed to have motivated or inspired them to accomplish great things. Also, Steve Jobs was smart.

With Trump's reality distortion field, he just doesn't want to see anything that might be a negative stain on him, so he denies that it is happening. It's what we see with his war on science.

But what is so disturbing is that he's gotten so many others to go along with it, including the elected governors of states, who line up for the privilege and often thank him afterward. When the history of this era is written, historians will be troubled to contend with the role of the complicit."

And that cleansing will need to use the chlorine bleach and disinfectant that our “president” sort of promoted.

Lastly, this quote from the piece “...perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.”.  Indeed.  The failure will be in the top five and now surpasses the infamous “..good job, Brownie” and “Mission Accomplished”.  And I know a Trump supporter will counter with the keeping your doctor issue.

Many died needlessly due to the lack of any semblance of leadership and governance from the Trump administration.
It is not a reality television show.  It is another type of show that starts with “s”."

Is that adversary Russia or the Republican party?

Both?"

Hubris, myopia, crossing their fingers, hoping and praying that they could force reality to conform to what they wanted it to be, to will C19/Viet Nam/Iraq into doing what they desired, based on their pre-conceived ideological worldview.

2020-07-19 12:15:26,"Excellent reporting - we now know the details behind the President’s big shift in pandemic policy in April.

The complete ineptitude of this administration never ceases to shock me. I can just see this “task force” sitting around in Mark Meadows’ office every day formulating their “state authority handoff” policy - it would be comical if it weren’t so tragic. Thousands of needless infections and deaths due to this cabal of clowns. 

It disgusts me."
2020-07-19 12:48:33,"It is apparent to me that the unstated strategy of Trump and the Southern no-nothing Governors is to let as many people get infected as quickly as possible to achieve ""herd immunity"" (not that Trump et. al. really understand that concept) and weed out the weak.

Those who die will be the ""heroes"" upon which the new economic boom will be built and whose memories will propel our Dear Leader to a second term. Many monuments will be erected across this great nation, especially in the South. Another American success story is born.

Heckuva job, Birxie."
2020-07-19 13:00:13,"Our country is being “led” by a fool who is supported by GOP cowards.  The only reason Trump is running for a second term is to stay out of jail.  Trump is willing to sacrifice the health and lives of  all 330 million of us as collateral damage as long as he can escape being charged, tried, and convicted.  And GOP hypocrites are doing the dirty work for him."
2020-07-19 12:17:23,"After offering to help acquire 350,000 testing swabs during an early morning conversation with one of Mr. Newsom’s advisers, Mr. Kushner made it clear that the federal help would hinge on the governor doing him a favor.

Doesn't that sound familiar?"

2020-07-19 13:12:17,"This article fills in the gaps in what I’ve heard with my own ears at meetings of top New York city financial and business people. Those people include individuals with direct lines to Kushner.

Wall Street and the business community had been pushing for reopening since April. I knew that. They were disparaging Fauci. I knew that. They did not believe that the disease was as great a threat  as Fauci believed and the New York Times, CNN and MSNBC were reporting. They thought that most cases were asymptomatic, the actual death rate was below 1%, most deaths were in nursing homes, and the disease would soon burn through population.

This article explains the backstory. Dr. Birx was giving them misinformation and encouragement. Meadows and Kushner were making policy and influencing Trump, who was panicking about the economic crisis caused by the shut downs. They were, as I suspected, relying on wishful thinking rather than science, but the wishful thinking was backed up by bad science and political ambition.

This was a disinformation loop. The business committee was pressuring Trump, Kushner and the federal government. The Trumpers were in turn accepting only  information that confirmed what they needed to believe, and reassuring the business community. I heard “everyone is going to get it anyway.“ The belief was that this would be a mild disease for most people and that illusion continues to fly in the face of the facts.

Now they know. Yet still do nothing. And we die."

The clear answer is no."

I think WH's  responsibility is to take care of the economic needs of people --WH did that by sending cheks, and states are responsible to manage coronvirus in each state, each state has their own issues, it's absurd to expect WH to issue one set of rules for all states....i think."
2020-07-19 11:51:05,"Of course no mention of the mass riots that were sanctioned and encouraged by Democratic governors that have undoubtedly led to further spread of the virus. Where was the containment effort there?  Or was that Trump’s fault, too?"
2020-07-19 12:12:23,"Go to Fox News' website. There you will find no case counts, no hospitalizations, no deaths. No data, no information, just ""stories"", mostly about the political fallout of the virus. A person might come to believe that no one knows how bad the virus is and, it's mostly political. Many people go to Fox News to get their news but they get only stories. That includes the President.  Not much news but a whole lot of fox there."
2020-07-19 12:31:21,"In order to “abandon” a leadership, role don’t you need to have been IN a leadership role?  From what we’ve seen, Donald Trump’s mission statement since January has been “The buck stops anywhere but here”."
2020-07-19 13:03:11,"If you support a president who abandons the WHO during a worldwide pandemic there is more to the story than a failure to lead.  It is more sinister than that.  

We need to investigate why he wants chaos and why he wants the US to fail, and we need to hold collaborators like Barr and McConnell and Meadows accountable."
2020-07-19 13:13:13,"And just think, Donald Trump entered the White House with a trail of a high-profile failures as long as a comet's tail.

2020-07-19 12:51:15,"Common element here is Colonel Dr. Deborah Birx following orders of a anti-social President just as General Colin Powell had done serving under the egregious George W. Bush. It seems that in times of national peril, good sense, medical and scientific reasoning and empirical evidence can be deliberately overlooked in order to obey. Our nation put in peril on both occasions. Ambassador Powell may have become our first person of color President; he had the intelligence, experience and charisma to easily win an election, but for his servitude to the President. Birx needs to step down. The Hippocratic Oath says, First do no harm. She has failed."
2020-07-19 13:04:28,"My mind is exploding from this article. At NO TIME during this pandemic did the President assume responsibility for leading our country. From the beginning there was denial and minimization. On March 13, the President said the words  “I don’t take responsibility at all.”  The reporting suggests a later abdication when there was never a committed coordinated federal leadership at all. Throughout this disaster the Trump administration has sought to escape responsibility while ascribing blame to governors, particularly Democratic governors. If the paper of record is going to assign a team of top reporters to give us a perspective at least start with an accurate timeline and honest premise.  Months of wasted time and failure to respond is a glaring omission of this reporting.  Do better."
2020-07-19 13:15:08,"There’s a brutal cost to a nation when governed through the lens of inexperience, corruption, racism, disregard for facts and science, weakening of democratic institutions, and a total lack of an articulated strategy. There are no surprises here, ineptitude has taken over the White House. As written by Michael Lewis on “The Fifth Risk” there are likely many other dysfunctional aspects of this government expanding and putrefying the nation at its core. I wish to fast forward to November, I really hope America wakes up and votes out this government, 4 years more may be to late to put the fractured pieces back together."
2020-07-19 12:10:21,"Failure? How can there be any assessment yet of what has worked and what hasn’t when we are still only likely a quarter way, at best, through this pandemic? Also, without having achieved herd immunity, how do we know that ‘model’ countries being held up to follow such as South Korea and Singapore won’t be spiking again and again? Sure, such countries, and much of Europe, may have minimal cases and deaths during such spikes for now and in to the future, but at what cost when they’ll need to be in quasi-lockdown mode for years to come?

It needs to be emphasized again and again - society and the economy being restored with the basics of precautionary measures and isolating the most at risk are the best strategy to pursue. That means a full return to work and to schools in the fall with staggered schedules and shift learning. Those who can’t adapt and cope, specifically teachers, need to get out of the way. 

And, BTW, this pandemic has only killed a mere million people and may be on to a 3-5 million when all is done. Considering that 9 million A YEAR die from hunger and hunger related ailments, that is a mere nothing in the scheme of human suffering.

But, I guess I’m forgetting - the health and safety of the 1st world privileged are paramount. The rest of humanity can just die while we wallow in our own fear and angst."
2020-07-19 12:54:51,"The incompetence, arrogance and sheer perfidy is just stunning. When does this disaster stop being political miscalculation and start becoming treasonous? 

Imagine if terrorist attacks broke out across the nation and, in response, Trump said, ""the states are going to call their own shots."" Republicans and Democrats alike would be calling for his head! And yet, in one day alone more people die from COVID than any terrorist attack in our country's history. No rash of terrorism could cripple our economy the way this virus has and will.

God help our nation if this con man is re-elected. I just hope we can hold out until November."
2020-07-19 12:57:09,"Dr. Birx! This is the shocking point the Times has uncovered. How could anyone trained as an epidemioligist not know that without herd immunity the virus would come roaring back unless the decline in infection rate induced by social distancing could be exploited to contain the disease through containment measures and tracing?
Trump sorts through people until he finds ones who share (or pretends to share ) his ""truth "", and with their help leaves chaos in his wake."
2020-07-19 12:15:27,"Why is anyone remotely shocked? Trump took the nearly half billion his daddy gave, not lent, him and parlayed that fortune into six bankruptcies and Trump steaks. Trump is nothing if but an abject failure at everything he does."
2020-07-19 13:12:32,"Don’t know why all the outrage. Anyone who listened to him campaign and paid any attention at all to his business career could not come to any conclusion other than he is unfit for most occupations, particularly POTUS. 

To all the people who did not vote in 2016 - please mail in your ballet or show up at the polls on November 3rd. If one is making a careful analysis of events from January 2017 to the present there is zero chance that an informed voter would trip the Republican lever."
2020-07-19 12:08:06,The actions of the Trump administration certainly falls within the guidelines for involuntary manslaughter due to criminal negligence...Mark Meadows sticks out because he and his group disregarded science over getting the economy open..that is criminal negligence

2020-07-19 12:04:50,"“People would still vote for me if I stood in the middle of Fifth Avenue and [killed 180,000] people.”  

Hyperbole?  Yes.  But this article clearly describes a monumental failure of leadership that perhaps caused tens of thousands of needless deaths and financial ruin for countless businesses.  Trump owns that fact.

It is beyond all rationality why so many millions of Americans continue to endorse this train wreck of a man and his sycophants given the facts and suffering we are all witnessing.

My question is this:  What has caused so much hatred in the hearts of so many that they would continue to support Mr. Trump after all the carnage he has wrought doing the past four years?

If the Republican Party is not now a cult, I don’t know what is."
2020-07-19 12:41:11,"The constant refrain by the president of the US was that the US was doing 'better' in testing and containing the pandemic than any other country in the world.

The fact is that the US with about one fifth of the word population accounts for one quarter of all Covid-19 cases, while also having one quarter of all word wide death caused by the pandemic.

Something is indeed rotten, and it's not in Denmark."
2020-07-19 13:15:01,"On Saturday the most current numbers show that up here in social distancing, mask-wearing Canada, we had 330 new cases and nine deaths. Compare that to the land of the free and the home of the infected's 63259 new cases and 813 deaths. Canada's per capita test rate is only about 60% of yours, but youze guys are about four times more likely to get infected, and close to twice more likely to croak! I regret that we didn't ask people to wear masks earlier; our numbers could be even lower now."

2020-07-19 12:56:41,"After looking at the polls then reading this article, the only conclusion is a failure of leadership. The failure of Trump. He is in over his head. He is scrambling to get re-elected. He puts the likes of Mark Meadows, Hope Hicks, Jarod Kushner etc in a room to decide the fate of the country during a pandemic.  That frees him up to figure out how to get back his base that is slipping through his fingers. He is a failed leader."
2020-07-19 13:19:22,"142,881 deaths according to the Worldometer this morning. ""It is just going to go away"" we were told by Trump.  ""Take Hydroxychloroquine"" Trump told us.

Our Nation is dying and the GOP remains silent with only one Senator speaking up....Romney.  We have to save ourselves this November."
2020-07-19 13:22:33,I was surprised to read about Dr. Birx's rosy predictions: Did she question the  assumptions of her models?  Was she trying to curry favor with  Trump?
2020-07-19 13:21:09,"The only bright spot on this terrible period in America is that it may be the nail in the coffin for the most corrupt, inept, and dangerous president this nation has ever had."
2020-07-19 11:50:07,"As the song goes, ""You ain't seen nothin' yet."" Trump and Meadows and their acolytes will continue on the course they've set because they believe only by ""reopening"" the economy will Trump have a shot at re-election. Consider the push to resume in-person schooling -- 70% of the country is opposed, experts are decrying the plan as irresponsible, but Trump and DeVos are threatening to withhold federal funds from schools that do not reopen while refusing the massive additional cash needed just to reduce the dangers. They have learned nothing.

If Biden wins in November, Trump's crushed ego and virulent personality will set out to destroy the US in the months between the election and inauguration. He will do everything he can to leave for Biden a smoking ruin. Recall that he claimed -- in an extraordinary lie -- that Obama officials had trashed the White House before they left. What Trump accuses others of doing is what he does himself. Biden and his people better get ready."
2020-07-19 12:04:51,"This leaves some questions:
- according to this, the White House, including Dr. Birx, seemed to truly believe through May that they had provided states with the PPE, tests, ventilators, etc. states had asked for, while states continued to show proof that they didn’t have what they needed. Where was the disconnect? 
- why were shipments of PPE arranged by states confiscated?
- how does the White House justify expecting states to deal with the pandemic on their own but not let them make their own crucial decisions about the economy and schools?"
2020-07-19 12:19:57,"The report that help was given to California only after Gov. Newsom agreed to publicly grovel before Trump is evidence that Trump continues to use the playbook he used when blackmailing Ukraine. I suppose we can expect to see a montage of these expressions of ""gratitude"" in Trump campaign commercials.  

Shameful."

2020-07-19 11:49:22,"The Trump Administration is guilty of asking the wrong question. Instead of asking, How can we protect our citizens from the virus, it asked, ""How much longer do we keep this up""? If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In light of this investigation, Dr. Birx should resign immediately."

2020-07-19 12:22:56,"This article exposes Dr Birx for what she really is: a very smart, very accomplished scientist and doctor who, at bedrock, is a career opportunist. 
It’s one thing to play the Trump game to make sure that there’s a voice of reality within the Administration. However, it now appears  that Dr. Birx is one of the architects of that game. 
Dr. Birx should be ashamed, but like the rest of the WH she probably is incapable of feeling shame."
2020-07-19 13:24:47,"Trump doesn't care if Americans die. And at this point, he wants to find a way to use the pandemic to call off the elections."
2020-07-19 12:19:49,"Trump, my energy is no longer being expended on your impotency. It is being funneled into election of Joseph Biden. This is what I suggest others consider:

Find out how to get a mail-in ballot in your state if you know you will be unwilling for health reasons to wait in long polling lines in November. Figure out which method you prefer and the deadline for applying for a mail ballot. 

Send personal notes to acquaintances who might still be in the fence and point out the assets of the economic, health and climate plans Biden is supporting. They don't need to like him personally.

Encourage young people you know to register to vote (those deadlines are coming up fast) and urge them to follow through by voting. I live young people: some talk the talk but fail to vote.

Be brave, be gracious, be a John Lewis wannabe and spread the message of returning decorum to our country. Breath and energy directed to the current situation is wasted. The vote is not.

And vote. If you really want change. You must vote without excuses. Vote! Vote!"
2020-07-19 12:34:46,Trump is correct if we stop testing the numbers will go down. Does not mean people don’t get sick and die. Maybe more die. But we will not know why they are sick so we will not call it Covid. They just got sick and died. And trump can claim the virus is under control because the numbers are down.
2020-07-19 11:57:47,"I’m baffled by Trump. He would obviously love to be America’s authoritarian ruler and to bask in the adulation of a hero. The virus presented the perfect opportunity for him. He could have taken over directing a national, coordinated effort, including ordering corporations to produce  items such as respirators, masks, etc., treating it like the public health equivalent of WW II. He would have acquired power and wide spread public approval and it would have been the right thing to do. So why did he do pretty much the exact opposite?"
2020-07-19 12:50:21,"As if you still need a reminder: in our system of governance, the White House does not rule the states' oversight of their own hospital systems, and the resultant battle against the virus.

However much you dream of a fairyland where a magic leader will sprinkle you with pixie dust and make the boo-boos go away, just as in politics, all virus is local."
2020-07-19 13:03:35,"The most important lesson I have learned from practicing medicine for nearly 40 years is the most important thing parents and their families want is: THE TRUTH. It appears Dr. Fauci was the only person in the WH willing to be honest and base his recommendations on fact, rather than what folks wanted to hear. Dr. Birx has been, and continues to be, a complete failure, preferring to be ""popular with the in crowd"". Her rosy optimism earns her as much blame as DJT, Kushner, and the rest of these clowns. 
Any competent physician knows to remain on the side of caution and prudence. The death, disability, and shattered lives defy description and we are only in the top half of the 1st inning."
2020-07-19 13:03:57,"It’s incredible that Dr. Fauci continues to be glorified and absolved of any responsibility in the bad decision making and faulty public health guidance from the White House as it in fact happened chronologically. Instead we are regaled by stories about Fauci such as he is a voracious reader of political histories, that he dialed health officials in NYC, Miami, and Chicago late at night and wasn’t given an office in the West Wing. Fauci was given daily air time at the Task Force Meetings for weeks during the time period that Birx is being blamed for. If he something to say why did he stay silent? In fact, Fauci had said publicly quite clearly that the President always follows my recommendations. Was he lying? I suggest framing the issue another way. DID Fauci himself make any mistakes? Can we learn from those mistakes to do better in our current situation?"
2020-07-19 13:13:55,"So Dr Birx, too, will have to face up to her part in Trump’s crimes. She too will have to face the tribunal."
2020-07-19 12:10:05,"Itr seems to be Trump's  modus operandi---when he cannot cope with a situation he just walks away  from it---leaving a lot of people in the lurch.  Google how many bankruptcies Trump has had .  Between 1991 and 2009, his businesses (not personal bankruptcy but his casinos and constructions) could not pay debts and just walked away. leaving creditors, contractors, investors, buyers and workers in the lurch. They did not get their pay,their investments, nor their condos.  Just walked way and let others worry.  Here too, let the governors (especially Democratic governors or blue states) carry the burden and don't bother the president.  They should have prepared and not bother him for ""our "" ventilators."
2020-07-19 12:35:22,"Eliminating funding for testing is mafia-style negotiation. States will get the money only if they agree to open everything up immediately, keep it open, and lie about the test results. Oh, and praise the mafia don to the hilt - early and often."

2020-07-19 12:39:32,"I don't expect a  POTUS  to simply sit down with people like Fauchi and simply do everything they advise.  What I do expect from a competent president is to listen and understand what experts from a range of disciplines have to say about this crisis or any other crisis which may arise--and then do his best to lead us through.  Our president didn't do this.  He followed his ""gut"".  Our dire situation is the result."
2020-07-19 12:53:08,"Throughout this crisis, Trump has done nothing but focus on his re-election.  He can only make the pandemic numbers go away by taking control of the reporting system and no longer report once the CDC is not involved.  Eric Trump said a few months ago that once the election is over the pandemic would ""magically"" go away.  Don't report numbers, don't test anymore, and it's gone.  In addition, the economy has tanked thanks to Trump and the GOP focus on re-election instead of America.  This is all Trump, with the help of Bill Barr, will need to either hold no elections or declare of a state of emergency and put the finishing touches on Trump's move to be dictator.   
 I'm sure Putin has been giving him some good advice on that front.  It's stunning how many people that work within the White House and in the GOP are so willing to jump on this bandwagon.  God help us.  Covid or not, We the People best be ready to take to the streets to save America.  Make America Great Again--Dump Trump."
2020-07-19 11:58:12,"It is very clear to the vast majority of people as well as to those who continue to prop Trump up that he has no idea what he is doing.  Trump's decision making has proven to be extremely detrimental to the lives, health and welfare of all people in this country whether they support him or not.

Now Trump wants to zero out the funds needed to test, trace and prepare for a vaccine that we hope will be available in the next few months.

The Senate and House can override his veto.  It's about time that the Senate did something right for the general welfare.  The Republicans backed a loser who led them down a rabbit hole of fake news, ""gut"" decisions with no science to back anything up, and an utter lack of any common sense, judgment or education.  He is a malevolent and unstable man seeking to destroy as much as he can.  Republicans have no way out of the snakepit of their own making other than to decisively and publically turn on this aberration of a head of state when we must do what is absolutely necessary to contain this pandemic and get our country back."

What became of the nation: at least 140,000 dead, surely an undercount, over 3.5 million cases and which are increasing at 
 over 500K per week.

Ok, at least the Pres. was onto something with the phrase, ""American Carnage."" However, it was prescient, not retrospectively descriptive."
2020-07-19 12:21:36,"I keep thinking if Senate Republicans had done their duty and removed Trump from office the first time he had shown he would do almost anything to get reelected, maybe we wouldn't have over 139,000 dead Americans."
2020-07-19 12:25:45,I truly hope the American people do the right thing and come out (or mail in) in droves this November and give this man the reckoning he deserves.
2020-07-19 12:40:39,"“Only in Washington, D.C., do they think that they have the answer for all of America.” This was the confident assertion of Mr. Meadows as he steered the country off of a cliff.  This is also the true legacy of the sainted Ronald Reagan, who made scorn for government respectable and fashionable."
2020-07-19 12:45:22,"The problem with readers' comments is that they are all essentially and rightfully contemptuous of Trump et al and thus are preaching to a choir.

 But it is to be hoped that this Times piece somehow gets the attention of Trump's base and makes a dent in its stubbornness. Otherwise, Trump's adherents are just as guilty as he is. Then again, there is no cure for stupidity."
2020-07-19 13:06:02,"At the beginning when my sisters said they trusted Dr. Birx, I said no, she's too in bed with the president. While many commenters place blame on Birx, the disaster we are experiencing is trumps, and his only. His “leadership” style only allows his staff to tell him what he wants to hear, e.g., it’s going away, no national strategy needed. Trump's only care was the economy, not on human lives, of which he has never had concern for. I'm angry that he has done nothing to reduce the number of deaths in this country. I'm angry his followers still will not wear masks. This whole administration, minus Dr.Fauci, is responsible, but no one more so than trump.

I think trump's re-election strategy is, your life for my presidency."
2020-07-19 12:45:24,"This report might be unfair to Dr. Birx.  She was right that prior to full re-opening, the US could have been like Italy.  New York proves it.  The politicians chose to ignore the guidelines that you say Birx wrote herself.  Which politicians took to the microphone to lead protest about re-opening? You can't say with a straight face that Biden led the charge with his vague video chats.  Where was the out-cry similar to the street protests about police brutality?  Redfield, Azar, even Fauci, stayed quiet or made tepid warnings or ambiguous recommendations at critical moments pre-Memorial Day.  It's wrong to point the finger at Dr. Birx."
2020-07-19 12:48:03,"This will be burned into textbooks, articles, blogs, podcasts, and the like as what happens when government fails. This is why we have a federal government. Sadly, it remains to be seen if our national catastrophe will be remembered as such by the people who lived it. How long until Republicans run another outsider-candidate, another business-man who wants to shake things up? How short will their memories be? Republicans got everything they wanted in Donald Trump, and only 140,000 people had to die. And counting."
2020-07-19 13:00:51,"Don’t let Trump off the hook for his early failures, which set the table for the later failures.

The nation lost control of Covid-19 in February with the CDC/FDA testing disaster, when Trump failed to either stock up on medical equipment and personal protective gear or tell the Governors it was their responsibility to do do. and when, similarly, Trump failed to prepare for massive testing or advise the Governors that it was their responsibility to do so.

We are losing the War Against Covid-19 because the Commander in Chief has surrendered."
2020-07-19 13:04:39,"George Lakoff, in his 2014 book, ""Don't Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate"", laid out one of the clearest analyses of the ideological differences defining leadership between Democrats and Republicans. Where Democrats favor more centralized decisions and policies, Republicans strongly lean towards decentralized, ""states rights"" decision-making. At its core, this is the model from which Trump's leadership failures emerge."
2020-07-19 13:09:35,By now we have all seen the results of this catastrophic policy blunder. But no one in this administration has really explained why Trump wants to cut millions from testing. Is it because he's so dead set against testing he just doesn't want it to happen? And is the answer really as simple as he thinks more testing equals more cases so no testing equals no pandemic? Surely others in the White House must think that's insane?
2020-07-19 11:55:53,"If they were to ever make a Mount Rushmore of shame, Trump’s face belongs up there as a warning to future generations.  This, of course, assumes that our country survives his “leadership”, and does not continue to spiral downwards.  And there still is over a third of the “adults” in this country who believe he is doing a great job."
2020-07-19 12:06:54,"The US is on the verge of utter collapse.  The lack of leadership in dealing with first wave of the pandemic spells doom, as the tsunami that is coming this fall in the way of a 2nd wave of the virus will be the fatal blow with profound and lasting effects on the economy and an overall weakening and vulnerability on full display for all of America's allies and enemies to see. The corrupt feathering of corporate America's nests and constant money-printing that has become an addiction since 911, will produce skyrocketing inflation and decimate the once dominant currency.  Allies have already shut the borders down to American travel and are untangling themselves as best they can from the economic ties that Trump uses as a weapon. The influence with its allies, disguised as friendship, has been poisoned. For the first time in its history, the US is on the mat, brought there by the abject incompetence of this administration and the full backing of the Republican crime family. And America's allies are not there to lend a hand. They've had enough of the charade. So the only real hope is for the voting public to don a mask, socially distance over the next 100 days and ensure that every provision is put in place 
 so that everyone who wants to cast a vote does so without interference. Once proper leadership is restored to all 3 branches,  bring to justice the perpetrators of the abomination of the last 4 years so that America can quickly retake its place as a global leader and beacon."
2020-07-19 13:10:49,"Given President Trump is the major source of the administrative failure that has not been corrected to this point in time. But Trumps blind faith followers, many of whom occupy positions of status in fields that require more passing knowledge in their fields, have responsibility for not having courage to put their necks out to speak out for more caution government leadership from the top. Add to the administrative failure the colossal failure of one political party to take into account the safety of each and every citizen in this nation who died for lack of national leadership during a worldwide pandemic. There is no wisdom of the ages operating in the republican party."
2020-07-19 12:05:23,"Liberate Michigan, liberate Wisconsin, and liberate Virginia.

The States  needing liberating according to Trump appear to have done well in handling the virus in hindsight.. 

It is Florida, Georgia, Arizona, and Texas that seem to be doing the worse.

So much for failed democratic leadership of States led by Democrats , it is the Republican governors that follow Trump who are failing on a massive scale."
2020-07-19 12:34:40,"It would have been really hard to beat a Republican President who was leading a great organized fight against the virus but ours didn’t even try.  

He has a congress that would have given any amount if money for testing, tracing, PPE, and virus research and he didn’t even ask.  Why is that?

Trump is not here to make America great and we need to find out who he is really working for and why senate republicans allowed it."
2020-07-19 13:08:40,"When the history of this pandemic is told, this will be THE definitive analysis of how a country with such advanced biomedical capabilities could fail so spectacularly."
2020-07-19 12:09:51,"Birx is the villain of the piece. Why?

1. As a statistician She was overwhelmed by the data while not apparently understanding the biases built into her models. In these sort of models the behavioral co-efficients become paramount over the purely statistical relationships.  The latter are in any event difficult to understand in the situation of a novel virus about which knowledge is only gradually being acquired. In reality predictions would be widely distributed. 

2. As a politician (yes She Is!) She provided support for Miss Rosy Scenario, because that is what the others in the WH wanted, with the optimistic predictions within the wide range of predictions.

However, that has not much to do with the issue of Responsibility. A pandemic you would think would be tailored made for A Mr. Fix It. Other politicians in other countries have seen their popularity soar. Why is Trump an outlier?

When you look at his record in government it is apparent that he has fixed nothing so we should not be surprised that he recoiled from this challenge. We made a mistake in 2016 in electing an incompetent. We keep doing this. Since 1960 only: Nixon, Johnson, Reagan and Bush 1 had records of prior achievement commensurate with the Office. 6 of 15 Elections. There is a lot of ruin in this Country!"
2020-07-19 12:19:28,"Reopening seemed simple- gateway, 14 day decline phase 1, 14 day decline phase 2, 14 day decline phase 3, 14 day decline phase 4.  Hardly any states followed this...now look at the mess since it couldn't be followed."
2020-07-19 11:53:54,"Abandoning  a Leadership role is one thing.  Actively working against any states/individuals who try to manage the crisis is much much worse and a more accurately description of this silly group, especially Trump.  He really has blood on his hands."
2020-07-19 12:30:09,"I predicted this happening - numbers rising out of control - when they opened states where the numbers were not low enough. I have no degree in public health. Of course neither did those who pushed for the reopening. It was clear this would happen. It doesn’t take a genius. It just takes a sane person who cares about her country and community. Of course, that is not who is in “leadership” on the federal leader. Instead a man who has only succeeded in business by selling his name and his son in law who also is infamous for poor business decisions. These two failures are making decisions for the physical and economic health of our country. The results are obvious."
2020-07-19 12:30:20,"Trump told us that when the summer heat arrived, the virus would disappear. Instead the opposite has occurred - people ignored the masking and social distancing recommendations and crowded into bars, restaurants, beaches and other gathering sites and the virus spread.

So much winning!"
2020-07-19 13:01:49,"It was clear from the start that trump & co would push responsibility to the states for the benefit they cynically perceived doubt so would give them for the election. That way, they could simply accuse whichever state gov’s were in their disfavor or failures and reiterate the 2017 inaugural “I alone can fix it.” 
Time and again, this lie has been exposed. Trump doesn’t fix, he breaks. Then sweeps it under the rug and blames everyone else. With over 135,000 coronavirus deaths to date, rising daily, only the willful fail to see it. It’s more than exhausting, demoralizing, outrageous. It’s fatal."
2020-07-19 12:13:48,"While the past is lamentable, why is Trump trying to cut billions from COVID testing at this time? To answer that question I presented the situation to a group of graduate students and their consensus fits Trump's sociological disorder and his history. When Trump is rebuffed by any person or group, he reacts violently, irrationally and purposefully. The polls are telling Trump that he was a failure as president so he seeks retribution to the suitor whose rejected him. In this instance, he's been rejected by 67% of the US population so he will direct his wrath against them. What better way to punish those who have spurned him but to cut testing and inflict even more disease and death upon them?

The crisis is not so much that a deranged person is in charge. The real crisis is the system that cannot remove him from office. That 325 million Americans are held hostage by one man with serious emotional issues."
2020-07-19 12:47:43,"I have long been suspect of Dr. Birx, primarily because she became prominent during the Trump administration. We have much data to suggest that anyone who survives in the Trump administration plays the part of a sycophant. Only people that have served multiple administrations, telling the hard news to both Republican and Democratic Presidents, should be trusted. Dr. Fauci has a proven track record on this. In this terrible time of the pandemic when public policy questions costs lives, we must demand that health policy leaders be trusted and proven leaders. We, the public, need to rise up and demand that we get the leaders we need to lead us out of this national tragedy."
2020-07-19 11:50:15,I used to question how Dr Birx was able to sit there silently and rarely question or challenge anything Trump said in press conferences. Now it appears clear. Here is someone with actual medical expertise who instead of actually using that expertise appeared more interested in doing PR spin for the administration and allowing them to spread their magical thinking to the American public. It's truly shocking. She should be ashamed.
2020-07-19 13:01:56,"I see many sharp, informative comments on a great piece of reporting. All I would add is, I feel sick and aghast beyond measure at the evil malfeasance of Trump and everyone in his orbit who are tasked with coming up with best practices to meet the challenges of COVID. 

We often say about things that they seem surreal, but this article reports facts that are surreal on steroids."
2020-07-19 12:12:09,"Dr. Birx has always seemed a little too smitten by the limelight.  However, she probably has genuine concern for the public's health. It's the other ice-water-running-through-their-veins cast of characters like Jared Kushner and Mark Meadows who represent the worst of humanity by brazenly playing politics with peoples lives as they watch thousands die daily from the virus. This news story could easily be an initial post mortem, if not epitaph, for the Trump Administration. It's difficult to see how it gets any better from this point."
2020-07-19 13:18:45,"Trump's plan is to have no plan; i.e., Trump and his ilk have decided that the best response to the coronavirus is to let it take its course.  This means that Trump will, as he has made clear from the very beginning, do nothing that would allow for a coordinated response and strategy to get COVID-19 under control.  In his view, since he truly cares about no one but himself, it doesn't matter that more people will get sick and die.  In other words, we should get over it and learn to live with the coronavirus."
2020-07-19 13:20:23,"So many wonderful responses to this article. My only wish is that Donald Trump would (or could) read. If he read this article and the responses of intelligent people, he might finally have a clue about the seriousness of this pandemic and how a true leader would handle it."
2020-07-19 13:05:40,"We could have gotten through this if we had had the leadership, discipline and sense of common purpose that Italy has demonstrated.  Think about that for a moment.  Not Germany or Denmark.  Italy and Greece and Spain.  

We should never look down our noses at the Mediterranean countries again.  We just don't have the spine, unity and willingness to sacrifice that the Italians and others do.  We have an ignorant swathe of our population who see a mask mandate as a fundamental threat to freedoms, instead of a necessary tool in defeating a deadly foe.  New York City and other areas of the North East must be excepted here ... we managed to get the virus under control and mirror Italy to some extent.  The lack of national leadership, however, leaves every US state vulnerable to re-infection."
2020-07-19 13:11:26,"It's been clear from almost the beginning of the crisis that Trump et al. are NOT going to do anything to abate the virus.  Why don't some of the ""experts"" draw a picture of what the country will look like on Nov. 3 --  and also on January 21 -- as the virus continues.  THEN present a plan on what we'll have to do to deal with it, and its effects, at that time."
2020-07-19 13:15:59,"Watching this all unfold, from afar, has been an indelible experience, and not a good one. I can only imagine the pain that citizens of the US are feeling. The method of leadership has been to yell at everybody to run down the corridor, and then to chuck a bag of marbles under foot, just for the sport of it.

I have no special insight into what Dr Birx conveyed or why, in the daily Meadows meetings. What is much clearer, thanks to extensive journalism and press conferences, rallies, etc. is that the political appointees and the inner circle of the executive are not fit for purpose. Perhaps, in another political life, some would have been, if they had advanced to their current roles by a less partisan route, and one that gave them the real expertise appropriate for their current positions.

The most invidious thing has been the absolutely deliberate strategy to hollow out any government institution that could ``impede'' naked capitalism of the neo-liberal kind. The widespread practice of using Acting officials rather than confirmed officials is another set of marbles chucked underfoot. There are very good reasons why the best in the world practices within government bodies have been found in  America in the past, and to trash that intellectual capital in this way, in a pandemic, is ineffably sad."
2020-07-19 12:26:25,"Trump wants Americans to die. His actions (or inaction in many cases) support this. If anything, he seems to relish making this crisis worse."
2020-07-19 12:29:28,"Donald Trump's presidential project has finally arrived at the point where all his projects eventually get to: bankruptcy.  He is finally in familiar territory and his wheel house.  Hopefully, the embarrassment of this epic public failure will not out weigh his doing the proper thing and handing the mess back to the stakeholders to straighten out."
2020-07-19 11:55:18,"All too often when a person disagrees with another, it’s easy to resort to hyperbole. 

With Trump , his Administration and the Republican Party, hyperbole may not be fully accurate. For 3+ years, all of them have gotten worse with respect to responsibility, empathy and plain humanity. What is wrong with people like this?"
2020-07-19 12:25:17,"Read this at 2 in the morning in bed, in the dark. Kept me awake the rest of the night.  Nothing here though that we haven't been witnessing in scary real time since January: The gas lighting, the obscene obfuscations, the complacency, the flip-flops, the obvious and daily manipulations spewing out of the Oval Office. This is the stuff my friends and I talk about on the phone each day, trying to decompress from the incessant and continually growing insanity of it all.  We wail, we worry, we protect ourselves from exposure to the virus by staying at home, praying, praying for a future with good people in charge who truly care about us."
2020-07-19 12:38:09,"I learned long ago that being a leader does not require you to  know all the answers but rather that you surround yourself with those that do, give them credit for their knowledge, which then allows you to reap the rewards for a successful mission.   Unfortunately, Trump is unwilling to admit that anyone is smarter than him, hence the reason his administration is a failure."
2020-07-19 13:19:26,"Italy had a very severe shutdown (people weren't even allowed to go into their own backyards!), that lasted well over 3 months and spanned the entire country. The US had only a couple of weeks of shutdown, of varying degrees of severity. The idea that the US curve would look like Italy's curve was the biggest mistake that Dr Birx could have made."
2020-07-19 12:35:41,"This reporting shows that once again the Tea Party/Libertarian ideology drives us into a ditch.  Meadows - like Trump - wants his ideas to be correct.  They are not.  This event proves it.  But it has been proven time and time again.

The US is in the midst of a 50 year decline.  The measure of the success of national policy is found in the wealth of the nation.  Ours has gone down steadily.  The policies of Ronald Reagan and the right have failed.  The pandemic shows it on a time scale that we can grasp.  The decline of the nation shows it in more substantial terms, but we cannot see it as easily.

Perhaps the best present day definition of a conservative is one who does not learn from experience.

We need to get rid of Trump because he is a feckless wretch.  But we need to get rid of Trumpism, the Tea Party, Libertarianism, and the right because it is all a proven failure.

Americans are correct to want the smallest government possible to do the job.  That is obvious.  But we need to build the best government possible in effecting that objective.

This pandemic did not require a large Federal government.  It did require a competent one."
2020-07-19 13:16:45,"Thanks to the Times for this postmortem of Trump's failures.  However, there is a simpler explanation for the train wreck we have all watched in horror.  Trump boxed himself in early on by telling us that the pandemic was a hoax.  His supporters actually believed him, and responded by fighting against any remedies to the pandemic.  In PA the Rs even impeached our Democratic governor for putting in a plan to flatten the curve.  They failed; he succeeded.

For Trump though it had become impossible for him to reverse course without losing the Trumpette support necessary for his reelection.  As he always does, he had to double down, leading to the deadly spiral."
2020-07-19 12:44:32,"The irony here is that Trump wanted nothing more than an economic recovery, yet undermined that very thing through his words and deeds. I'd say ""Shame on him"" but for the tens of thousands of needless deaths, for which I say ""Lock him up!"""
2020-07-19 13:13:00,"Trump and his advisors like to repeat that Dr. Fauci was wrong about his early advice and predictions, which Fauci changed based on emerging realities.  Fauci has been exactly right about the need for masks, social distancing, and more cautious reopening.

So, when will Trump, his administration, Dr. Birx, and all the GOP ideologues at national, state, local, and citizen levels who have blindly followed, say that THEY were wrong to ignore or minimize these precautions?  

Prediction: never.

Most people conscientiously follow the scientific advice.  But far too many others don't realize that the virus cares nothing about their ideology, and exploits their refusal to wear masks, social distance, and more cautiously return to a new normal.  This jeopardizes us all, especially the courageous health care workers who face the COVID at their own peril.

Public health is a common pool resource that requires shared responsibility, which far too many people have refused to accept, following Trump's disgracefully selfish, ignorant, and arrogant example. 

This has made America -- with barely over 4% of the global population and consistently near 25% of global virus cases and deaths -- the land of the free and home of the foolishly irresponsible.

As the world watches, we are failing as a country and as a former global leader, with unnecessary and enormous death and sorrow, and untold costs to the economic and social well-being of America.

What's so great about that?"
2020-07-19 13:26:50,"One thing you got wrong:  it is not ""one of the greatest failures of Presidential leadership.""  It is indisputably THE greatest such failure in American history, and one that continues to result in tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths and  destroyed incomes.  It would be bad enough if he would recognize his mistake and work to correct it:  not doing so in the face of overwhelming evidence shows just how sick and dangerous he is."
2020-07-19 12:35:03,I believe all data is pointing to Dr. Brix being blamed for this and her new role will be the scapegoat. A terrible and sad way to end a incredible career.
2020-07-19 13:15:51,"Looking at national statistics in the USA is misleading. New York suffered a terrible outbreak centered in the metropolitan NYC area. Here in Upstate NY, the impact was much less.
People here railed at Gov. Cuomo and called him a dictator. They didn't see why our local economies had to shut down.
Now, Cuomo looks like a success. The curve is broken and, ironically, we don't want people coming from places like Florida to reinfect us. 
It's not just one wave of pandemic. Each locality, however you define it, has its own story. When I look at maps of hotspots, some Central NY counties are red.10 days ago, it was Oneida County. Last week it was Chenango County. How does that happen?
We may want the story to be simple. As Trump recently observed, you test good one day and then you test bad. NYC tested bad and now they test good. Florida tested good, and, maybe, misled, and now they're testing bad. 
The point is that the virus is contagious and it will spread if conditions are right. Tragically, Trump and his minions seem to want to make the conditions right for the spread. It's hard to imagine what will happen as they persist in their magical thinking."
2020-07-19 11:56:07,"I still don't understand how it is that I - with access only to news and personal experience of the pandemic while working a full-time job - could clearly see that the only reason numbers were going down in April was because people were staying at home, but this obvious fact was not apparent to leaders of the government."
2020-07-19 12:31:19,"This is a monumentally important story involving the work of hundreds, compiled and written with a dedication to scientific data and historical verification.

But how many Trump supporters would read it if they ever came close enough to see it?

That is the problem. The United States is now two countries, each working under different realities with widely divergent “facts” and totally different understandings of what is happening.

The only hope of returning to one country with one understanding of the reality of the true outcomes is the November election and only if Republicans and their leader play by the rules and accept the results. Who can calculate the probability of that?

If Trump wins by whatever means, the consequences are catastrophic."
2020-07-19 12:13:44,"The problem is that Trump doesn’t believe in science and will not believe the experts but rather follow his gut. At the same time he is perfectly willing to ignore the science and blame everyone as the country crashes he will be the first to claim credit for the work of the scientists who develop a vaccine. The science and facts were here before Trump and will be here after Trump and they continue to say the same things. They don’t need to follow a gut instinct, but rather go through careful controlled trials to be proven. This is not history’s first pandemic,  the scientists understood what to do to control it, it was Trumps first pandemic to control. And he failed to handle it and save lives by not following history and science, but just listening to his gut."
2020-07-19 12:30:25,I've truly considered the possibility that Trump is controlled by nefarious forces but recognize the possibility the GOP is shallow enough to engage in a blue shifting strategy at the expense of the Country.  Trump and the GOP themselves may well be the nefarious forces
2020-07-19 12:36:33,"Our country is being run based on image and branding, and the monetary gain of image and branding.  From the President to Congress to state leaders to corporate leadership, no one is sincerely concerned about the health and well-being of the American people.  They are only concerned with how it makes them look, and how it effects their bottom line--reelection and/or revenue, sometimes both.

American leadership at all levels is the very definition and the poster child of narcissism."
2020-07-19 12:58:44,"Can we afford another SIX MONTHS of Trump's ""American Carnage""?  His behavior goes beyond a disability to lead, as Trump has clearly shown he is able and willing to lose lives, destroy the economy, and poison the well of community spirit necessary to combat this viral pandemic.  Still, our only Constitutional means for Trump's immediate removal of office -- the 25th Amendment -- relies on the 52 Senate Republicans who are not about to stop being this rogue's rogues, especially when there are broadly followed media outlets supporting Trump's attempts to distract Americans from his critical failure of leadership."
2020-07-19 13:18:41,"A devastating summary of April on, and good follow up to the April 11 article look back at failures earlier in the pandemic.

I have to wonder if the leakers are intentionally throwing Dr Birx under the bus with the goal of blaming her incorrect medical advice when in fact she was just producing what they wanted: justification for doing what Trump ridiculously thought would help his re-election. Models are convenient because just change the assumptions and bingo, you get the result you’re looking for. Dr Birx is only of the sycophants Trump has surrounded himself whose jobs are to take whatever whim Trump has and support it regardless of whether it will kill hundreds of thousands of Americans, destroy our economy, and put us in a recession for a decade. 

The ultimate blame, of course, starts and ends with the President. If he can’t act in the best interest of the country during a non-partisan pandemic,when is he going to? Never."
2020-07-19 12:10:19,"States' rights has been a contentious issue since the founding of our still-fragile nation, and for the last forty years at least (remember Ronald Reagan?) has been one of sacred cows of Republicans and their largely anti-government base.  Alas, the ideal of a ""more perfect union"" is far from being realized.  My worry, come November -- and particularly if Trump loses his bid for reelection -- is this ""leave it to the states"" mentality might lead to conflict this country has never seen the likes of, and for which our government, weakened as it already is, may have no answer for."
2020-07-19 11:59:20,"Trump likes only success. that is  why he labels whatever he does great, unprecedented, etc.  So, when he saw that he had no capacity for dealing with the virus, he took himself out of it,but WITHOUT leaving it in good hands.  He is, in essence, a coward who runs away from the fight.  Didn't he do before?"
2020-07-19 12:52:02,"I am truly disappointed with the role Dr Birx has played. More self serving and ingratiating to Trump than scientific.  We need solid, apolitical medical leadership willing to stand up to the administration if necessary."
2020-07-19 11:59:42,"No president can gain the trust of the people without telling the unvarnished truth, however difficult the political circumstances. Trump lies so much, it’s long been a way of life for him, he has squandered the respect Americans naturally confer on the Office. And he shows no sign of trying to turn that around and appeal to those voters who did not previously support him. Instead, his campaign strategy has been to double down on the divisive rhetoric that appeals only to his base. He doesn’t understand the importance of telling the truth, the one quality common to great leaders. Trump is no leader."
2020-07-19 12:43:27,"The consequences of this administration’s self serving decisions are huge.  A ruined reputation for Dr. Birx is probably the least troublesome.  I doubt that Trump or the taxpayers are aware that the many people suffering from this disease have accrued medical expenses that have not been covered by insurance be it the ACA or other.  These expenses are added every consumer’s bill to be paid out of pocket or by insurance.  This will raise the cost of premiums, medications and other medical expenses.  Insurance or no, we all will end up paying more.  Watch your federal, state and local taxes rise."
2020-07-19 12:37:25,"This is the culmination of the conservative movement's long war against FDR's New Deal, against ""big government,"" against a national safety net, against science. It's not just the Republicans' belief in states rights, but also their belief that private contractors can succeed where government will fail (and that giving federal largesse to private contractors will add to their wealthy donor base). The Republican playbook of cynicism and selfishness has always been to do whatever it takes to get the White House and then use that power to diminish the government in every area except for making tax policy to benefit the wealthy, bloating the military budget, and steering the judiciary to rule against the interests of women, minorities, unions and the poor. Their catastrophic response to the pandemic was a perfect storm waiting to happen."
2020-07-19 12:46:51,I can't help but wonder if this virus had any outward physical reactions associated with it like skin lesions or paralysis would the federal government have handled it more responsibly?  It's a silent killer as is Trumps way of handling it.
2020-07-19 12:50:39,It is not just the question of Trump's failure on the pandemic control front but his failure to take full responsibility for the task of governing the country he rightly or wrongly has been mandated to assume office. This is only because his sole aim is to promote his own interest at any cost even to the extent of putting the whole country into trouble and misery.
2020-07-19 13:19:13,"While we weren’t expecting a pandemic, the entire structure of the presidency under Trump — indeed, the entire structure of the Republican Party — has been to deny reality in every way.  On issues of wage inequality, opioid deaths, homelessness, Voting access, civil rights, Education, immigration, for-profit jails, the environment and more, the Republicans and their president refuse to listen to facts, science or even the public interest.  Their goals are padding their own pockets, raising the wall between themselves and real people, stacking the courts, and getting re-elected. It’s been a nightmare for anyone unable to participate in theIr millionaire’s game. Sometimes I wish I were younger and could look forward to tearing down the walls they’ve created.  Not all the time, you understand — the repairs that will need to be made when he leaves office are monumental."

We have many American friends, my daughter went to school there and we own property there. (which we will not see soon).  Reading history of how one individual can wreak so much havoc, I never understood how it could happen or that we would not have learned, now I see with Trump how otherwise wise, educated and resource rich individuals can we convinced to make such poor decisions, it is sad to see the wealthiest country in the world unable to take care of each other, and the unselfish acts of the majority seemingly negated by the selfish few, lead by the master of selfishness in chief. it is also sad to see America unable to come together, because if differences were put aside this could be solved. be well and be safe, good luck!"
2020-07-19 12:49:48,"It absolutely stuns me that a person like Dr Birx with a PhD produced models based on only one set of assumptions even as it was obvious that the reality of these assumptions was shifting on the ground.

However, even if the reality were not changing, she should have produced reports and graphs showing the results of various assumptions. A sensitivity analysis showing what would happen IF people didn’t wear masks may have affected some officials view of the situation (although probably not).

Further, it is incumbent upon any manager such as Chief of Staff Meadows to ASK for reports including a variety of assumptions to assess the risks of their decisions. They simply got what they wanted to hear.

And it appears that Dr Birx was only too willing to provide them a statistical justification for what they wanted to do anyhow. She knew how to please her audience and acquiesced.

After this article she should simply resign. Her knowing collaboration in supporting these disastrous decisions has destroyed her credibility and as a result she should resign."

But he wanted praise and thanks - see Gov. Newsome's phone call.
The virus was and is and will be threatening what Donald Trump wants. Not the health of the people - Donald does not care about that at all. The virus means HE can't have his fix of rallies. The virus means HE can't have a ""rocking"" economy to brag about.
Donald Trump's personal needs have driven every disastrous decision He has made or not made.
The daily headlines about the pandemic are taking away from Trump's message in a way that America, Americans and especially the main stream media have never been able to achieve.
The pandemic is raging across the country because Donald Trump never cared about the health of the people.

If the number reported tests are staying steady, declining or only slowly rising and reported confirmed cases are rising swiftly then you are measuring a virus out break and not testing.  It is a matter of common statistics.

But Trump and his aides chose the path  of denials and blaming the testing which after all are only a messenger for what is happening.  Shifting responsibility to governors, the tests, experts or anyone handy has been Trump's pattern of handling this crisis as it has been in every situation confronted in his presidency.  The only he hasn't blamed is perhaps the one most guilty of all,   the Russian President Putin who gave him his election."
2020-07-19 12:22:58,"Trump failed by not only refusing to wear a mask (and visually demonstrate leadership), but by emphasizing that wearing a mask was ""voluntary.""  He also aggressively pushed states to open, and Republican leaders followed.  One of Trump's personality traits that doesn't get enough attention is his interest in being ""contrary.""  Notice how often he is not in alignment with Science and other world leaders?  And I expect he is contrary because it brings him more media attention.  I'm not sure Trump knows what he truly believes, only that he wants to continue being in the spotlight."

2020-07-19 05:31:28,"Thank you, Michael D. Shear, Noah Weiland, Eric Lipton, Maggie Haberman and David E. Sanger.  Great research and reporting.  I raised the following question in another Comment Section.  

“Did Dr. Birx inform the Pence Coronavirus Task Force of her meeting with the Chief of Staff Mark Meadows Coronavirus Panel? Why wasn’t that group’s existence made public? Did Dr. Birx see several different outcomes from the given data ( you know like the various, and very legitimate, Weather Models when a Hurricane forms and it’s spaghetti like possible predictive pathways are shown ) and pick the one that was politically acceptable to Trump.”  

IMO, it’s obvious to me that  Meadows did this not for scientific curiosity nor any real safety meaning but to solely placate Trump’s desire to think only about the life of the economy not the life, health and safety of regular Americans.  They can be damned and die for all President Trump cares.  This alternate Study Group, IMO, had a preconceived outcome of where they were going.

""Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs.""

2020-07-19 02:56:50,"On Jan. 27th, Joe Biden sounded the alarm about a global pandemic in an op-ed in USA Today. By the end of Jan., 8 cases of the virus were confirmed in the U.S., with 100's more likely incubating undetected.
 
Trump apologists claim the outcome would've been the same under any other POTUS (i.e. Joe Biden). Wrong. 

Biden would've utilized the expertise available in the pandemic response office set up by Obama to proactively deal with this very situation. With that team already in place, the federal government would've begun a more robust response in early Jan., perhaps even earlier, in an effort to minimize the problem AHEAD OF TIME, BEFORE it grew into a bigger crisis.

In a Biden administration, there'd be no interference or shadow policy run by unqualified family members or sycophants. Instead, there'd be public health and medical experts in charge. Their expertise, which Biden would've deferred to, would've fast tracked mass testing & contact tracing capabilities, as well as PPE production and distribution, all of which would've enabled a proactive public health defense against the virus.

Instead, we have a POTUS who held rallies, played golf, and did his ""best"" to dismiss warnings by intelligence agencies and the CDC...in an idiotic, selfish attempt to keep numbers artificially low, prop up the stock market and protect his re-election.

With this threat, early detection & prevention were crucial to containing the virus, as well as limiting its damage to the economy."

I can only imagine how bad things would be if that confinement was not imposed so early."

His televised coronavirus briefings have shown him to be a methodical, compassionate, strong and down-to-earth leader in  time of unprecedented urgency and despair.  He has sidestepped the politics and pushed forward with clearheaded guidance.

He is attempting to do the same with the current pandemic except that while he can bury financial loses in the courts, bodies are buried in a cemetery for all to see.  Just like his taxes that document his failures, Trump wants to obscure the number of infections and deaths to make it seem as if has been successful.  Dollars or bodies, they're all the disposable in Trump's world."
2020-07-19 14:32:20,"Trump's political strategy to abdicate and deny was set long before the events described in this article.

It is a matter of public record that Trump was briefed by national security experts in early January, and very likely well before that, perhaps November or December.

The Senate Intelligence Cmte was briefed on Jan. 22 - yet the media coverage of the focused exclusively on the insider stock trading corruption, not the failure to respond to the COVID threat they were briefed on.

Finally, the NYT early coverage enabled Trump's strategy by, among other things, neutrally describing the ""traditional"" US public health system as ""decentralized"" and failing to report on how privatization and deregulation drove the lack of preparedness, planning and response."
2020-07-19 14:33:51,"Superb article looking behind the seen to the working group ""calling"" the shots since April. 

Still the main issue is the man who empowered that group and gave them some conflicting instructions. ""Fix the problem but don't make liable"" for anything does not work. 

The fact the Trump never took ownership for any of the failures of this government even when asked ""to you take responsibility for the failure of testing"", made that group clamor to rosy scenarios with incentives to pass the buck to the states. 

This article should also mention the irony of Trump push to force re-opening of school in person after saying to state you are on your own in managing the virus. How reopening school not about managing the virus ?

We should ask for Trump resignation on the 200,000th death from COVID19. Unfortunately, we will likely reach that tragic milestone before November. If his job was on the line he would most likely ""burry"" the numbers rather than focusing on truly fixing the problem and acknowledging past error."

The reported cited Korea as a best case, noting the very large number of tests done to control spread. 

I recall Dr. Birx taking the question and responding that 96% of the tests were coming back negative, implying that the testing was a waste of time because there were so few positives out there.  We now know that, as the article informs us, this is precisely how many countries were able to keep the pandemic under control, through testing and contact tracing.  Unfortunately, with 75,000 cases per day in the US, this option, which Dr. Birx seemed dismissive of at the time, will prove a great challenge."

2020-07-19 13:45:11,"Trump, Cuomo, et al largely did what they were advised. That's the problem.
Because Fauci, Birx and CDC “science” projections from the UW and Oxford ricocheted at us were massively wrong, leaders focused on all the wrong things, losing half of our fatalities in nursing homes, because the elderly weren’t protected while relatively virus-safe children were. These doctors knew that immature data sets would overstate danger, yet emphasized them rather than compensate for them.
The Fauci path was protecting the unnecessary to preserve hospital resources that went largely unused, at the expense of suicides of small-business owners who lost everything, deaths from delayed but vital elective surgeries, bankrupting smaller and rural health care providers and with millions more children insecure in food.
Last, HCQ worked the entire time against Covid and literally cost thousands of lives because in spite of successful use in Europe, NIH and CDC poor-mouthed it, some governors banned it accordingly, and the FDA withdrew approval for use.  And all these people claiming it was dangerous knew darn well we safely took it like Rolaids for malaria in the 1960’s.

With strong and continuously emerging evidence that Trump has had a long history of consorting with assorted criminal elements, what shocks me is just how the man was ever able to secure his own security clearance.

I thought that anyone who had a serious chance of winning a major party nomination would have to be properly vetted before the completion of the nomination process.  If this is the case then, given Trump’s grime, how did he manage the clearance?  If it isn’t the case, please change your process to ensure that such vetting happens well before the person finds him or herself in the Oval.

They substituted their own wishful thinking for real intelligence and experience.  We had political operatives in charge of the response to a pandemic when we needed real scientists and economists to mitigate what was obviously going to be a tricky epidemic to control. We had the likes of Mark Meadows, Jared Kushner and Donald Trump making decisions about what should be done! What happened is a lesson in what happens when you send adolescents to do a man's job. They all failed America. Four more years of Trump will be four more years of chaos, death and tragic economic decline."

Pres Trump is only interested in Pres Trump and his election possibilities.  He spent his whole life misstating matters and was able to get by with it.  This is an example of the need of qualified and dedicated leaders of America.  The great harm that has been done, even before this pandemic, with this kind of mindset/leadership is insurmountable."

This is important coverage by the times, and has more insights than the superficial news coverage the country gets lately.

Dr Michael osterholm, who is quoted in other current articles, has consistently remarked that the actual number of cases far exceeded what the official tallies show (even now), and has specifically commented on the questionable reliability of the various models being used to estimated the next course of the disease spreading. 

While some issues with models are addressed here, osterholm has discussed these issues in greater detail.   Because it’s a novel virus, we are using models based on flu and other viruses that are not as good as they might be if we had better data on COVID. 

Speaking of data - something not really addressed here - dr osterholm has noted many areas that epidemiologists want to study more (like aspects of how the virus is transmitted, the precise effect of masks on aerosols etc) - however, the USA (unlike other countries) is not collecting complete data sets that would facilitate further scientific research."

What if Lincoln, during the Civil War, had dropped his ""Anaconda Plan"" allowing the enemy uncontested entry (and exit) through our lines?

What if he left it up to the remaining states to organize their defense?

Instead, Lincoln was resolute in a steely way with the occasional glimpse of humanity, virtues never seen in Trump.

Though mis-steps would be many, there was never a doubt: it was for the Federal government to defeat the enemy.

There's a bit of irony at play now as the virus rages across the south in a 21st-century version of states rights (run amok.)

We are, in fact, at war, and Trump sided with the Covid confederacy as he dithered, deluded, and finally deflated into the pitiable mass we see today.

We are on our own until January, as we have been all along."

He has no strategy for climate change, racism, police brutality, economic inequality, international relations or anything else.  His only strategy is to identify the divisions in society and widen them.

Millions of desperate people with no money or prospects, many on the streets?  Why wouldn't some of them start stealing from others?  Besides their peril, we could all be in peril.

2020-07-19 14:31:18,"And why has it taken the Times and other media two and a half months to recognize and write about the fact that this President shifts responsibility to others whenever and where ever he can?  

Some of us have been pointing this out FOR YEARS!  I suggest you read Mary Trump’s book if you find it necessary to see the source of this behavior.  

The problem with you “guys” is that you appear to think all men operate along similar lines.  

ATTENTION: Trump is laying down the norm breakers for federal military interference in the November elections — right now in Portland, Oregon.  The Courts will excuse this, the Congress has no force of arms even if the Senate Republicans we’re willing to even speak against his actions (which they are not) and the jig will be up by November’s interference.

The pandemic has exposed any underlying weaknesses in American governmental structure and systems.  But those who aren’t sick or haven’t faced the stress of inadequate medical help continue to live in Trump’s dreamland."
2020-07-19 14:36:53,"It’s not just Trump; he is the epitome of Republicans’ contempt for government as anything more than an instrument to protect the rich and powerful.

When you put people who hate government in charge of the government, don’t act surprised at the result."
2020-07-19 14:36:13,"Before Mark Meadows convened this group do you suppose his discussion with the president was ""Sir, we are going to shift the blame away from you to protect you from your failures"" or ""Sir, we are going to work to put the blame for this problem squarely where it belongs; on the Democratic governors who criticize and disrespect you.""  Odds are, it was the latter."
2020-07-19 13:29:38,Excellent article on the dysfunction in Washington and the lack of leader ship this country has been experiencing. I believe the only good news is that we only have a few more months of the most unfit president of our time. Thank you for your work on lifting the iron ￼￼￼￼ curtain Trump and his republican ￼ cronies have lowered over Washington.
2020-07-19 14:04:29,"The health and safety of 350 million Americans hinged on a small coterie of officials, only one of whom had any public health expertise, and she had drunk the Trump koolaid? In particular, it included “Hope Hicks, the protector of Mr. Trump’s brand”? Since when does Trump’s brand have any relevance to our well-being?

This week, we saw the White House actively lie about Dr. Fauci and attempt to tarnish his well-deserved reputation. This article makes clear that it was Dr. Birx who should have been the subject of criticism. 

The virus was an inconvenient fact for Donald Trump’s plan to be re-elected. He resisted it initially, preferring ignorance to response. When finally cowed into acting, he and his administration sought to harvest credit wherever they could, deserved or not, even as they were working to divest themselves of any role or responsibility in addressing the crisis. They have actively worked to worsen the situation. And still one-third of the country supports him? Unbelievable!"
2020-07-19 14:42:11,"Yep, getting the economy re-opened so we could get the Dow above 30K, get everyone back to work, ignore sick and dying, so the Kushner - Trump dynasty could re-bloom and take hold. In it for themselves. And that my friends has become the story of America these last 30 years. In in it for themselves. Offshore the jobs so as not to pay employee medical benefits, so as to not pay the working person much if anything really. Then deride them for turning to benefits at the state and federal levels, SNAP comes to mind. I bet Fox News has dedicated a few hundred episodes to that topic alone. Meanwhile the country borrows to pay some 1.3 Trillion for Medicare and Medicaid in 2019. You think we'd have an annual expense like that if most employees in this country had health insurance? How about that tax cut in 2017 that was coming up short for passage so they  enticed Senator Bob Corker by adding some commercial real estate corporate pass through exemption. Who did that benefit? Me? The Trumpers? No. Themselves.  In it for themselves. 

This presidency is a result of In in for themselves but in a most perverse way, he speaks to the disenfranchised American Worker as if he were one, but in the end, he cares only of keeping what he has and what he can get. Regardless of who pays him. Foreigners, lobbyists, lobbyists of Foreigners, the In It from Themselves crew looking for environmental law changes, tax breaks etc.... This is who we've become because we've accepted it and voted for it."
2020-07-19 14:06:53,"Not a single randomized controlled trial with verified outcome has been able to detect a statistically significant advantage of wearing a mask, when it comes to preventing infectious viral illness. Therefore you are not helping the people around you by wearing a mask and you are not helping yourself avoid the disease by wearing a mask."
2020-07-19 13:29:13,"At the end of the day we elect representatives and particularly the President to protect our interests.  Without empathy toward the people you represent, protecting them is completely irrelevant.  

Trump has no empathy for people or any living thing.  People getting sick or dying isn't relevant to him.  If he could just fill another stadium and hear the adulation for him, that's all he cares about.  He hasn't failed he simply doesn't care.  

Joe Biden is a very imperfect candidate.  Joe Biden has made a lot of political mistakes.  Joe Biden has empathy.  He will at least try and protect the health of the American people.  Trump simply doesn't care."
2020-07-19 13:33:57,"Thank you for this well written and informative article, as depressing as the truth it exposes is. This should serve as a cautionary tale to those who will listen.  On the one hand there is a WH that, no surprise, only wants to hear that which supports their narrative that all is well so that Trump's re-election is assured.  We know exactly where that got the country.  And then you have an esteemed scientist, Dr. Birx, who seems to have lost both objectivity and the ability to discern truth from fiction as she tries to please her boss.  In doing so she may have cost rather than saved lives.  And finally those who speak the truth, like Dr. Fauci are ignored and even ridiculed. How tragic for all of us."
2020-07-19 14:28:28,"After long thought about why Trump makes the statements and decisions he makes, I have come to the conclusion that causing pain and suffering to people is the point. I believe Trump actually derives pleasure and satisfaction as well as a sense of power from hurting people and causing suffering. If he can make his perceived enemies suffer, all the better but any general chaos or pain gives him satisfaction. There are no particular principles or values that he operates from other than enjoying the suffering of others as well as corrupting people to also cause suffering to others."
2020-07-19 14:37:10,"Now the White House is actually stoking the spread by rerouting vital information,
cutting out the CDC, concealing statistics and trying to withdraw funding for testing.
Lets not forget much of the testing system the Feds set up is so marginal and inefficient that some states like Texas have asked them to stop/leave because the results are so delayed that they are useless."
2020-07-19 13:40:10,"""LEAVE IT UP TO THE STATES"" has been used since early April as an excuse for the apprentice president to shift blame/responsibility. So... how exactly does this square with the Governor, and Mayors, of Oregon demanding that the creepy ersatz-cops leave their state, only to be met with: ""whatever, we do what we want"", as an answer? Either give States autonomy or step up and do your federally mandated job to lead the country (as per the Constitution, remember that piece of paper?)"
2020-07-19 14:18:11,"I agree with many commentators. tRump did not lead. tRump avoided and ignored. The pandemic interrupted his goal of becoming eternal dictator of the US. The virus is not going away as he promised, so the facts go away. Business as usual as he and the WH attack anyone who warn that the virus is not going away. His current goal, do away with the testing so the numbers go down. At the same time, he pours money into a vaccine. That part is necessary, but he is the worlds joke. There is a huge chance that the vaccine will just be a flu shot; anything that will get his poll numbers back and put him back in line for being re-elected. He does not care. He is desperate; not to help people who are getting sick and dying from the virus; not to help people recover financially; he is only desperate for higher poll numbers."
2020-07-19 14:21:38,"The worst behavior I see from people is outright denial that we are in the midst of an out of control global pandemic. The hotels where I live on the Oregon coast sent emails beckoning people to travel here, the airlines send similar deals encouraging travel. This is not a time to be traveling around. The virus continues to spread because too many want to have gatherings and pretend it is safe when it isn't. Workplaces are also not distancing and many did not make masks mandatory nor supply them. The employment department here in Oregon just recently addressed the mask issue after their call centers had C-19 infections.
The testing isn't robust nor rapid, you have to be symptomatic or have been in contact with a known infection to even qualify for a test, and it may be several days to get tested and another week to get the result and in the meantime those people go grocery shopping or to a bar or restaurant. The asymptomatic carriers are being missed entirely under the current testing failures. The virus continues to spread as a result of all of this and the fact that it was not contained back in January and February when over 100 thousand international travelers returned to the US with little to no screening and not quarantined. That was the crucial step that our ignorant leader failed to address. They own this mess."
2020-07-19 13:45:27,"Of course, there was an enormous, irresponsible, and deadly lack of leadership from the White House. But I predict this article will allow Trump to place the blame on Dr. Birx. It's certainly not her full responsibility, but it's disconcerting that she had some responsibility for the disastrous lack of action by the president. She should have known that Trump would hear only what he wanted to hear."
2020-07-19 14:05:23,"John Lewis was a leader.  Time and again, he risked his own life for what he believed in.

Mark Meadows and President Trump are confidence men.  Their decisions and advice have already lead to the deaths of 130,000 Americans, while they sit in the White House safe and isolated from the disease."
2020-07-19 14:18:36,"This article should be a case study in the absolute failure of Presidential Leadership and its corresponding ramifications. 

What I've taken away from the content is that Trump never has shown any real concern or empathy for Americans and the impact COVID is having on their lives. To the contrary, Trump sees COVID purely through the lens of his re-election, it's something to be spun and if that does not work, just go with his always present fall back plan...lie . 

We are where we are as a result of Donald J Trump. Lives have been lost and  businesses have closed because of his failures, yet he's totally oblivious. 

Now the states are left to figure it out for themselves. Unfortunately, they're just as dysfunctional as Trump. Republican led states feel they need to mimic the bad behavior of Trump rather than showing Leadership. So you end up with states like Georgia with a clueless Governor who is actually suing the city of Atlanta for mandating that masks be worn. This at a time when Georgia infections and deaths rom COVID are at an all time high. 

Let me net this out for everyone. People are dying and businesses are closing. The situation is NOT getting better. If wearing a mask will help save lives and keep businesses afloat, then DO IT! It's your responsibility as an American."
2020-07-19 13:35:58,"In some states, like FL, where GOP governors followed Trump in downplaying the crisis, they have pushed responsibilities for making tough decisions down to the city levels, so mayors can take the heat. Profiles in cowardice."
2020-07-19 13:54:38,"Japan deaths from coronavirus: 985.  U.S. deaths from coronavirus so far: 142,000.  Think about that.  The utter incompetence of the Trump administration is beyond belief.  

Trump needs to be removed from office before he and his administration cause the deaths of more people.  Do you notice Trump is doubling down (as always) on his failed “strategy”?  He is trying to cut funding for more Covid-19 testing, changing test data reporting from the CDC to Washington where he can better “control” it, and muzzling health officials from testifying to Congress because they are so “busy,” among other things.  If Trump and Meadows and Birx and Kushner had any integrity they would resign.  Given that is not going to happen Congress should consider a no confidence vote and possibly the 25th amendment."
2020-07-19 14:12:12,"As terrible as this is to say, if COVID results in Republican defeat, it may have been worth it all. If Trump gets re-elected, his environmental policies alone are enough to destroy the prospects for organized human society.

Let this be the last gasp of neo-liberal insanity; may the Republican Organization be destroyed once and for all."
2020-07-19 14:17:28,"Sadly, the people who need to read this article will never see it. They will turn to Fox News for information. 

This piece outlines the severe negligence of duty by “he who shall not be named” and all who are complicit. 
If a doctor or hospital acted negligently in the care of a patient, they would be sued. Not that the president and his minions are giving actual medical care but they are preventing proper care and testing.  They should be sued. All of them.

His statement that if we reduced testing , there would be less cases. What a concept! Let’s reduce testing for diabetes, heart disease and cancer and we can wipe these diseases out! People would be dying from “natural causes”. 

One more issue that I can speak to personally is the suggestion that hospitals were/are inflating case numbers. I am an RN who works in the Documentation Improvement dept at my hospital. We review charts for accuracy and clear documentation so they can be coded properly for billing.  We cannot code COVID unless we have a positive test. Period. There are patients who we know have it and are treated for it whose tests are negative. They have all the symptoms and the positive supporting lab work and imaging. But if we can’t get a positive COVID test, it can’t be counted. I have heard That possible 30% of negative tests are not accurate. 

If you claim to be a patriot, wash your hands, keep your distance and wear your mask."
2020-07-19 14:18:35,"The Chris Wallace interview makes it clear that Trump doesn’t have the cognitive abilities to be in charge of a bake sale, let alone a pandemic response. 

Counting backwards from 100 by 7 is hard. So hard."
2020-07-19 14:41:34,"Trump handed the responsibility off to the states, but then had the Federal Government steal the PPE & testing supplies ordered by the states and undermined the Governors’ authority with his “liberate” tweets. Trump did whatever he could to make it worse. It’s not incompetence, it’s deliberate maliciousness. The question is why would a “leader” do this?"
2020-07-19 13:53:42,"It is called a pandemic because humans cannot control it. They can only react to it or think they are controlling it. There is a price for controlling it too. New York has seen more than 400,000 cases of coronavirus and nearly 28,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The one smart thing 1000s of NYers did was to leave NY city when the pandemic was about to hit hard. If we were all to spread out across our beautiful land and breathe fresh air and sunshine instead of crowding our densely populated cities we would have done just fine.

The job of the government was to empower its people to take care of themselves and provide financial support, hospital beds, food supply chain, essential protective supplies. The Trump administration and the US congress promptly stepped up to the challenges with courage and speed and only ungrateful creatures will keep spewing biased reporting. Thank you President Trump administration, Senate majority leader Mitch McConell and Speaker Pelosi and all members of the US congress for your timely assistance to my fellow Americans and American businesses who have survived so far and in all likelihood will survive the rest of the pandemic. What matters to many Americans is Black lives and orderly safety of all Americans and hopefully racial justice will prevail."
2020-07-19 14:08:13,"“State authority handoff” = Cut and Run.

""Cut and Run.""

Republican political strategists love this 3-word slogan.  From Wikipedia, we have ""The phrase is used as a pejorative in political language . . . becoming particularly associated with the United States Republican Party.""  (Please feel free to look it up.)

With ""cut and run,"" the Republican Party's own formulation applies very precisely to Trump's coronavirus dodge.  (Oops.  I used the scientific name ""coronavirus""; I meant ""China virus,"" as Trump called it just this week.  Or ""Kung Flu,"" as he called it in Tulsa.  Or ""Chinese Virus,"" as he called it months ago.  I'm thinking ""Trump virus"" might be best because of America's unique, Trump-led failure among developed nations.)

On America's tragic failure to have leadership in containing the Trump virus, we see a ""cut and run"" president like no one has seen the likes of before.  Believe me.  Many people think so.  Tremendous, tremendous failure.  The likes no one has seen."
2020-07-19 14:22:29,"Bullies have a sixth sense about when they’d be overmatched, and they always walk away from any fights they sense they could lose, because to stay bullies, they can never afford to show weaknesses, and defeats expose them as beatable.

That is why Trump walked away from COVID-19, didn’t order the Defense Production Act, and has washed his hands of 142,000 deaths. There’s nothing mysterious about his complete detachment, absence of empathy, or lack of a conscience."
2020-07-19 13:59:23,"When I read the other day that our president said ""Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes,""  I thought, really? This is what our president says. Thank you NYT for your incredible reporting to set the record straight. Not that it can do much about the mess of handling  the virus  our imperious president has made."
2020-07-19 14:07:31,"As the State Department’s special representative for global health diplomacy, Dr. Birx no doubt has more of an accommodating attitude than does Dr. Fauci. Unfortunately, her role in the disaster created by this administration has diminished her credibility to the extent that I don't see how she can now successfully serve as a health ambassador to other countries. They might laugh in her face at anything she recommends."
2020-07-19 14:10:17,"Donald Trump has created a Republican death cult which has lead to exploding cases and more deaths in Republican controlled states and California. When he keeps stating that we have enough tests and that things are good, he becomes like Jim Jones who continually lied to his followers until they followed him to commit mass suicide. Trump’s gaslighting also negatively affected the residents of blue California which resulted in less mask wearing and social distancing and an explosion of new cases there as well. I wonder if and/or when the whole nation will rise up in protest to demand a coordinated federal response. Until then, Kool-Aid anyone?"
2020-07-19 14:23:26,I’m reading a book about Russia and at a part discussing Lenin.  Lenin didn’t want economic opportunities for the workers because they would then buy into capitalism.  Rather he focused on non-economic activities that would cause workers to focus on socialism and party loyalty.  The Donald seems to have taken a page out of Lenin’s playbook.
2020-07-19 13:32:00,"First off the virus doesn't spread but merely attaches and then reigns deadly havoc. The behavior of an involuntary host is what spreads this invader. When trump purposely labeled the virus as a Democractic hoax he communicated to his mostly Southern and ""red"" States that what was occurring on the Northern Sea Coasts was more of the liberal, far left fake news of the media as he had been repeatedly doing regarding anything obstructing his continuous campaigning. His followers behaved accordingly. They spread the virus and have continued to do so far greater than even China, trump's distractionary subject. that attitude perpetuated the increased spreading behavior. This is the trump/pence and trump family mode of operating that is supported by Senators having the judgement one does not want in any government. Leadership is all about encouraging beneficial behavior and with a virus, towards the goal of saving lives. Holding a red hat rally spits on that behavior and fosters an environment of predators."
2020-07-19 13:45:03,"Dr. Birx's seduction by numerical models that give results we want rather than the results we're really getting is another instance of how ""data driven decision-making"" can go so very wrong, as was so well illustrated in Robert McNamara's infamous Vietnam body counts. Shameful. Look at all the people you've helped condemn to death, Dr. Birx."
2020-07-19 13:59:56,"If President Trump had acted in the beginning only, that is January only, the US could have avoided so many deaths and also by now overcome the situation to some extent in stopping the spread of the virus. Trump and his administration officials failed 'miserably'. Failed, because their only intention was from then, that is from January, they concentrated only on Trump's second term as President."
2020-07-19 11:58:42,"I would love there be a class action suit brought by the families who’ve lost loved ones to the virus against trump, Kushner, meadows and Brix for ineptitude and callous disregard. The mishandling of the virus by this administration is beyond the pale. It is beyond words. The suffering of the country rests on their shoulders- medically, economically and socially.

It seems all the actions by meadows and Kushner point to not disturbing or upsetting trump. Mary Trump, you are so right. This narcissist, we call president, could not be given harsh facts lest it disturb his bubble for reelection. His absurd comments like ‘lessening testing will lessen the number of cases’ and his refusal to wear a mask and urge the public to wear masks point not only to his disregard for the public but also to his denial of leadership. He has flipped flopped so many times during the past months that it is surprising he hasn’t gotten whiplashed.

Today is Sunday and so someone from the administration will make the rounds on the Sunday morning talk shows. How they and Fox News can still defend the administration’s handling of this pandemic is beyond me. Trump’s retweeting chuck woolery’s tweet that the virus is a hoax just goes to show how desperate he is. Anyone, but Fauci, is trustworthy and reliable.

Almost four years ago, many of us knew trump wasn’t equipped to be president. Let’s not make that mistake again. Time to drain the￼ swamp of trump and his enablers."
2020-07-19 13:30:53,"I do wonder if sources have thrown Birx under the bus a bit as she a woman and an ""outsider.""  Also, I doubt she could have forseen how clumsy the ""reopening"" would be in certain states."

2020-07-19 14:13:11,"""Inside Trump's Failure"". Even the headline is wrong. Since taking office, his administration has been one of failure after failure, of bullying, spite, pettiness, corruption, amorality, bombast, and judicial perversion. If his vanity and dangerous ""medical"" prescriptions juxtaposed with bad, if not dangerous advice, during this crisis were his only failure, voters might be able to dismiss it as a one-off in poor judgement. Unfortunately, there is a pattern here of one man's maniacal obsession, namely himself, supported by a phalanx of cowardly sycophants that began the unravelling of America long before coronavirus entered the scene. Bad as this virus is, there are other pandemics far more deadly plaguing the world, America in particular: ignorance, demagoguery, anti-scientism, and anti-authoritarianism. They fuel the belief of victimhood among the weak and simpleminded who, in turn fan the flames of vile nationalistic fervour with unspeakable acts of racial and religious intolerance. 

Voting for Trump once might have been an honest mistake. I don't happen to believe that having another word in mind. But do it again...well, that's the beginning of a pattern."
2020-07-19 14:16:27,Leadership from President Trump? Be serious. Leadership requires thinking about someone other than yourself which Donald Trump is totally incapable of doing. Leadership requires the ability to listen to opinions that are contrary to your beliefs and learning from them which President Trump is totally incapable of doing. We as a Country are facing a pandemic that requires strong Leadership to combat. Instated we have Donald Trump.
2020-07-19 14:04:29,"The thought occurred to me when reading this article that next year when Trump is out of power, he should be tried for genocide at the International Court of Justice. He has done incalculable damage already and we still have six more months to endure. He really has to pay for his crimes. Even a humiliating defeat in November is insufficient - society needs to be rid of him."
2020-07-19 13:28:57,"This is not a catastrophe of merely misguided decision-making in the Trump White House. This is the culmination of decades of deliberate effort by ... whatever we have now that used to be called conservatives. They destabilized federal finances by cutting taxes while accelerating spending, leaving the cupboard care when we need it. They undermined confidence in experts, science, and facts -- from evolution, to climate science, now to this. They embraced shadowy, murky conspiracy theories, from Benghazi, to Pizzagate, to QAnon, to the Steele Dossier. Not content to merely 'agree to disagree' on good faith, they demonized and destroyed anyone daring to challenge their orthodoxy.

They have pursued all this with reckless disregard for the truth, with no discernible principles, with a blind eye toward the consistent failure of their actions. And now it has all come home to roost. Our glorious nation is in tatters, understandably spurned by the rest of the world, ceding global leadership to China, deeply in debt, intensely divided, weak and prostrate, demoralized and lost.

I believe in America. I believe in the restoration of our greatness. But I also believe this will happen ONLY when these toxic, corrosive, destructive forces are purged from our midst."
2020-07-19 13:49:17,"Hurricane Katrina devastated one state. FEMA jumped in, the whole nation got involved with many individuals going to help out. One state. Federal and nationwide response.

2020-07-19 14:37:00,"This story is both more or less factually accurate, yet at the same time lacking in context and also extraordinarily biased.  The Times’ goal is not to provide clarity for readers, but rather to disparage the President to further extend Mr. Biden’s lead in the polls.  This is understandable for an advocacy publication, but not for an institution that likes to pride itself as the nation’s newspaper of record.

The Times itself did exactly what the paper describes the Trump administration as having done. By publishing a lengthy series of editorials and columns strongly advocating mass protests against racism, the Times thoroughly ignored the biology of the pandemic. The editorials bore titles such as ""Protest is Patriotic.""

Large protests with close interpersonal contact, shouting, and the impossibility of contact tracing are an effective way of spreading a respiratory virus, and likely contributed to the current surges to a greater or lesser extent. 

Analogous to Mr. Trump, the Times allowed  its understandable desires for social justice to override scientific reality.

The Times is correct to investigate the mistakes made in managing the pandemic.  It should include examining itself in a mirror."
2020-07-19 13:41:51,"The critical person I am not seeing in this reporting is Peter Navarro.  Is he the source - and using NYT to sacrifice Birx and escape his own culpability?  We all know he came uninvited to task force meetings yelling about reopening - even before some reckless optimistic interpretation of the data could support that view.  Certainly Birx was not doing a great job, but it seems that an unreasonable amount of blame is unloaded on her.  She was not the one who created and pushed the reckless narrative, she just provided a few supporting ""data bricks"" they could cherry-pick and use to support that disastrously wrong narrative."

This is beyond dereliction of duty, this is purposeful malevolence on an unimaginable scale.  That's when ""no plan"" became the official WH response, the response of the heartless, soulless monster in the WH.
Removing this criminal from office is not enough."

In his book, Leadership is an Art, the late CEO of the Herman-Miller furniture company said: 

""The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between the two, the leader must become a servant and a debtor. That sums up the progress of an artful leader.""

Yet we have watched this country's so called ""leaders""  in the WH destroy reality, blame failures on others and demand total servitude.

Hopefully, not a third: a scorched earth temper tantrum wrecking everything in his path for the 78 days between losing his re-election bid and the inauguration of President Biden. Trump has handled his presidency in much the same way he managed his casinos. He is a horribly insecure man-child, a bantam rooster, an emperor without clothes."

Something similar happens to Trump now.  He is trapped in the White House, WAAAYYY  out of his league, has no clue what is going on, how biology works and he has lost touch with the reality of what is going on in America.  

The same, apparently, has happened to Deborah Birx.  The very moment she made the first compromise by disregarding scientific evidence in favor of political expedience (no doubt to save her job), she became a lost cause.  You cannot make a pact with the devil and his demons and expect to survive intact.

2020-07-19 13:59:04,"Another example bias by the NY Times.  This is exactly what Bari Weiss pointed out in her resignation letter.  

Anyone who is fair-minded understands that the response to the CoronaVirus is being lead by state governors--with the Federal Gov't standing in the background, lending assistance.  

Here is a list of what the Trump Administration has accomplished in fighting this pandemic:

--Travel from China was stopped---very early--while the WHO was still downplaying the seriousness of this virus.  For his promptness and insight--Trump was called a racist by liberals.  Now they say he waited too long.  

--In May, Trump activated the Defense Production Act--in response to an expected shortage of ventilators.  As it turned out, there was never a shortage--due to the Administrations quick action--and their success in moving ventilators to where they were most needed.  We are now exporting ventilators to other countries.

--Trump has worked with private industry to speed up production of PPE.  Again, there is no shortage and you can buy masks just about anywhere.  

--The Trump Administration has been in touch with dozens of pharmaceutical companies--lending support to the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  Several companies had successfully developed vaccines that produce antibodies to the virus--and they are being fast-tracked.  

If Trump invented a cure for cancer, tomorrow's headline in the NY Times would read: ""Trump Puts Thousands of Oncologists Out of Work""."

But lets not forget the culpability of the right-wing media machine (i.e. Fox ""News"" among others) who, even now, continues to gaslight that third of gullible Americans into believing this pandemic is not real while the rest of the world looks on in abject astonishment at the collapse of the greatest country in the world.

A surgeon has invited 150 people to a wedding at his house with dinner and dancing afterwards in September. He’s a doctor for goodness sake! Kids sports are in full swing here and no masks. I can go on but it’s too depressing and makes me angry. 

One of the biggest issues beyond it being political is that the American public does not want to have their lives disrupted. I see it everyday when I have to brave the stores here and people are not wearing masks. The public is tired of the pandemic but they are making poor decisions at their own peril. 

Solid rules (not guidelines) about masks, social distancing, and all of the other stuff should’ve been set forth by the federal government. It did not happen. We all now live in a dumpster fire in this pandemic."

You know, the “only I can fix it” approach, so why isn't he?

One of two things may be happening, the ultimate rule of an autocrat whose word is final and his denial continues, or an upcoming, planned distraction so big it will make the virus look secondary at best. Either scenario is frightening."

It’s hard to believe that she so incorrectly analyzed the data and told the administration the virus would decline based on models, without considering the effect of the role of social distancing and other containment measures.  It seems much more likely that Trump and his lackeys (and she is not one) are doing what they always do - pointing the finger elsewhere.

In the next article, let’s get the real story.  My guess is that it is that Trump’s sycophants twisted what she said, as they do with everything they don’t like, if they don’t outright insult and denigrate the messenger."

Arms tightly crossed, petulant, pouting--the mash potatoes his brother dumped on his head for ""being a brat"" piled atop the absurd hairdo.  Self-centered, ignorant, petty, a classic schoolyard bully. There are just too many negative terms to describe this ""clown"" as his sister allegedly described him. 

And let's not forget just a partial list of sycophants and enablers: the rookies: Kushy, Hopey, Ivanka, and the pols: Meadows, McConnell, Graham, Gohmert, McCarthy, Jordan, Nunes, Gaetz plus our own Florida entry: DeSantis.

Is Donald Trump a good leader?  No.  
Did the NY Times do its very best to make sure that he couldn't lead during CV-19.  Yes, starting perhaps with its editorial position that Trump's initial travel restrictions were proof of racism.
BTW, the real question here is ""will Joe Biden be a real leader?""  The answer for this reader is ""clearly not."""

I remember about 20 years ago, before the internet, when the New York Times had writers that wrote factual stories and then added their point of view.  Maybe during the downsizing, driven by the internet, that talent pool had to be dismissed.  That is too bad.  The downside for the New York Times is that without Trump their revenue will dry up and the paper will close down.  You would think these writers would want another four more years of employment."

I pray that minority of Americans that were fooled and voted for him may finally see the truth before he does any more damage. We need a President who takes control of this covid crisis, not leave it to Trump's friends and family so they can make money off this pandemic. America needs to retake its world leadership role  it had under Obama/Biden.  We need to get rid of Trump who makes deals with dictators to help him get reelected.  Our democratic allies in the world wars laugh at Trump.  Trump is not just an embarrassment, he is bankrupting our economy and causing too many good Americans to die needlessly.

Not.
“mid-April” is an unseasoned journalist’s error and an uncritical editor’s oversight.
Instead, try this:
“The roots of the nation’s current inability to control the pandemic can be traced to November 8, 2016, when 304 electors in the Electoral College received their charge to install Donald J. Trump in the office of the President of the United States.”
That assessment is no less sharply political than the published sentence, and, on account of its relative candor, it is more palatable as well.
Or try this:
‘The roots of the nation’s current inability to control the pandemic can be traced to 1980, when the Republican Party started its effective assault on funding for public education and, more generally, on science and critical thinking.”
Now we are getting somewhere. Keep thinking when you write and edit. Honor history and perspective. When you do that, the products will shift from superficial sound-bite quality analysis to important contributions to public understanding."

Last week an email was sent out updating the situation.
Part of what it said
""While we were hopeful we’d be able to bring a small number of employees back to U.S. office locations beginning in August, due to recent spikes it’s clear this will not happen.  In fact, at this point, we are assuming the majority of employees will not be returning to U.S. offices this year.""

The only place the Coronavirus is receding is in the tortured mind of Mad King Donald.
No matter how much Trump demands it, the pandemic cannot be lied or tweeted away.
And arrogant ignorance, the only skill Trump and his entire administration possess, will not solve anything.

We have to save ourselves.
Wear the darn mask.
It is not a political statement.
It is an ""I'd like to live and so would my family, so I'll wear a mask to help keep everybody safe"" statement.

The political statement will be voting Democratic in November.
Every office, every seat.
Our choices this year are Trump's ego or reality.

With Biden, at least medical science will take the lead.
And McConnell's Do-Nothing Senate needs to be flipped.
Mitch McConnell is the least patriotic man in America.
Even worse than Trump.

Wear your mask.
Wash your hands.

At first he showcased the medical experts, who he thought he could control like a puppeteer; at the same time he urged anti-science “freedom fanatics” to “liberate” states that were following the advise of his own task force. He pushed states run by members of his gubernatorial lackey contingent to open their states in defiance of his own task force guidelines. We know how that is working out.
Maybe you’ve seen the clip of Chris Wallace asking Trump about his mask aversion. Trump offered up a typical word salad: he was for freedom, Fauci was against masks, he doesn’t believe masks will end the pandemic and then...he is for masks. 
Trump managed to cover all his bases and at the same time say nothing. That is the hallmark of all of his half baked policies and utterances. Unlike his mistresses  Chairman Kim and Cutie Putie, or President Xi, the Coronavirus does not play along with Trump’s foolish games. It doesn’t negotiate....it can’t lose a huge market for its exports. What it has done, because of it’s unrelenting reality, is expose Trump’s phony con job in a way that those who chose to play along with Trump’s fantasies (be they Dr.Birx or Chairman Kim) cannot do."

Then he repeated his efforts with witness and evidence tampering, aided and abetted by senate republican during the “a perfect call” impeachment process.  He remained true to form with his initial attempts to minimize COVID-19 ie..less than fifteen cases and soon it will be zero, a democratic hoax, warm weather will kill it, everything but a response that would have indicated how serious he took the crisis.  
The central point of Trumps reelection campaign was the economy and the most effective responses to the spread of COVID-19 were “clear and present dangers” to his reelection.  Despite his proclamation of being a war time president ready to take charge utilizing the vast power and resources of the US government  we can cite his standup comedy routine ie.…I’m not a doctor, but I have common sense, “the doctors here at the CDC are amazed at my level of understanding”, “we have more cases because we test more”. as his personal leadership efforts.  While defending his decision to remain involved in his business empire Trump said “you knew who I was before you elected me”.  Well now we know."

What level of depravity is needed for your mother's survival to be not even a self-absorbed afterthought during this pandemic?

2020-07-19 12:13:49,"The real problem is America's #1 policy maker. It is President Trump's very own insane gut. It has an insane mind of its own. It considers itself as the biggest expert on not just any one field like other experts, it believes it is the biggest expert on every issue. So Trump constantly follows his insane gut's advice over that of established experts. 

It is clear Trump's insane handling of the virus will not change and by the time Trump leaves office he will have caused trillions of dollars of damage, with millions of infections a day. It is very clear this cannot be allowed to happen. Even if Trump cannot be removed the Republican and Democrat leaders must come together and declare this epidemic as war and pass legislation that the virus leadership must be taken away from Trump and handed over to Dr. Fauci and team. This virus is a fire and professional fire fighters need to handle it. This virus is a war and professional generals need to be in charge. 

I cannot see why Trump cannot be removed on grounds of insanity. Is the dignity of the White House bigger than tens of millions of Americans going through the virus torture & a few million dying with the economy going into the #'gut'ters?

For the long run insanity must never again be allowed to compete for the White House. All presidential contenders must be tested for insanity by an independent team. All those who show signs of emotional instability must be removed from office at once. Trump's virus leadership has to go."

2020-07-19 14:32:38,"“Testing causes more cases...” , “I don’t want my numbers to look bad...”. So dumb , so insensitive, so lacking of knowledge of medicine! 
“Cases” and “numbers” are human beings /Americans who are either sick, dead or have the potential to make other members of the citizenry become so.
“Testing” is the tried and true mechanism to identify the above, so medical and public health interventions can be applied to decrease “cases” and “numbers” and free society from this “plague” . When “testing” is not done “cases” and “numbers” become sick and dying from “cause unknown”. 
In short “ testing “ does not “cases”. If reflects the reality of a public health problem. If we increase the number of “testing” for leprosy ( Hansen’s disease) in the US from 10 million tests to 300 million, the maximum total number of “cases” will most likely be the same - about 250 in the whole of the US. 
Some people just have issues trying to solve problems without accepting and defining the problem first (denial).In medicine such an attitude can clearly have mortal, morbid and economic consequences as can be clearly seen now based on the current leadership at the federal and state levels."

He has time to attack his own administration including his own picks in his own administration. He has time to attack any American who speaks out against him. He has time to attack our Intelligence and believe Putin over American's public servants. He is attacking our children by wanting to send them back to school with a deadly virus.

Republicans have taken Dems--and the country--to school on options to governing ""the likes of which the world has ever seen and options no one ever thought possible,"" to quote our Stable Genius In Chief, and it remains to be seen, given a Dem sweep in Nov. if Dems might put their newly learned skills into practice to benefit The People rather than the Grifters."

2020-07-19 15:08:13,"The bizarre aspect of it is that if Trump was really a stable genius, he would have mandated wearing masks months ago. 
By now, the US would be in control of covid 19 like most of the western world. Businesses would be opening up nation-wide. With proper funding and precautions, we might even have been  able to open the schools safely. 

So if Trump had actually acted like a real leader, he would be coasting to re-election like most incumbents."
2020-07-19 15:15:17,"COIVD has been the New York Times finest hour, fearlessly reporting the heartbreaking and countless mistakes made.

Tireless, determined and fabulous. The New York Times makes us proud to be journalist."
2020-07-19 15:56:04,"Yes, thank you we should document this, but it is so sad to see the numbers in states that believed Trump alone could save them. Turning a pandemic into a red or blue loyalty test has been a disaster. And it sort of obliterates the entire Republican argument on small government and states' rights. You need federal assistance to face a difficulty of this scope. But the Trump fever has not broken and that is incomprehensible to me."
2020-07-19 15:23:06,"Clearly the ""streamlining"" of the Global Health Security and Biodefense in the NSC by the Trump Administration was a really smart move. Breathe-taking that Dr. Birx was the only scientific expert in the room while all these decisions were being made. November can't come fast enough. We have to get these people out."
2020-07-19 15:19:01,"I hope all of the Democratic Governors (Inslee included) learn from their mistake of being pressured into opening too soon by a loud but small minority of their citizens. Here in Washington we were on the right path. Then the right wing “no one matters but me” mob started pressuring the Governor to open up and he relented. Now we have a surge of new cases and the cat can’t go back in the bag. So people like me (and there are many of us) will stay home and not contribute to the economy. I wonder whether I normally contribute more or whether the small minority of loudmouths do?  I’d bet on me, but time will tell."
2020-07-19 15:27:06,"It was a narrow tightrope indeed that Dr. Birx needed to walk between being straightforward with and responsible to the American public, on one hand, and trying to remain in the good graces of her irrational and approval-driven boss, on the other.  Her failure to resolve this conflict will forever tarnish her once sterling scientific reputation."
2020-07-19 15:38:47,"Another article in today’s paper details the administration’s demand that Republicans cut funding for coronavirus testing from their draft relief bill. The Senate leadership is said to be enraged about it. So, what are they planning to do? They claim they care about the country’s well-being; we need strong, well-funded test-and-trace protocols to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Will the Republican senators finally resist Trump’s destructive demands?"

Well, there you have the unpacking of the Brix contribution.  She loved her new Oval Office digs and West Wing treats.  Where is she now?  We know, don't we."
2020-07-19 15:07:19,"They say Trump usurped a lot of power to the Presidency— defying Congress, obstructing Justice, pardoning his perjurer, withholding his taxes, deregulating environmental  laws.
But in another sense, he has weakened the Presidency: Knowing which direction to go, guiding and leading, bringing everyone together, giving hope and encouragement and comfort and solace. A moral compass. A parental figure. 
We have  no true President now."
2020-07-19 15:56:10,"If one reads this article carefully, the conclusion is much less than the sweeping indictment of the current administration's Covid-19 response that was intended. President Trump's erratic impulses no doubt contributed significantly, but his administration's decisions on reopening were based on data, not guesswork, and it was the Governors and municipal officials who made the final choice of lifting the shutdowns.   It also ignores the political imperative for all of these politicians to ease the stringent shutdowns that strangled the economy and threw millions out of work.  The mainstream press has a bad habit of skipping political layers of authority to blame exclusively Republican office-holders for botched responses to disasters, as it did with President Bush during the Katrina hurricane, and this article is a good example of that.  Maybe we'll see a more thorough treatment after the election is over."
2020-07-19 15:37:48,"I disagree with the broader framing of this article, which sets this up as a comparison between Dr. Birx vs. Dr. Fauci. That is not the point.

There are going to be disagreements among research experts about the modeling. The point is that the White House, as always, embraces the experts that have the conclusions they want. Experts are simply cherry-picked so that the facts fit the President's conclusions, rather than the President's conclusions being informed by the facts. Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx had different recommendations, both were informed by science, however one took a more pessimistic view of Covid containment and one was more optimistic. So, of course they then decide to sideline Fauci and send him back to the CDC, and to give Birx a White House office. They had already decided to restart the economy; she told them what they wanted to hear.

It is the administration's job to listen to all viewpoints, especially the most critical viewpoints, in order to make the best policy decisions for our country. These failures therefore falls at their feet, not Dr. Birx."
2020-07-19 15:09:23,"Do we really need a Times investigation to tell us the Trump administration failed to lead and claimed victory without any success to show for it? On any matter rather than specifically as it pertains to the pandemic? It's obvious to anyone paying attention.

The disturbing part is that 35-40% of the country is in complete denial about it."

The man whose clinical psychologist niece has characterized him as a sociopath among a litany of other serious DSM flaws will stop at nothing to be re-elected. If thousands more Americans die because of his and his cohorts gross malfeasance-so be it.
Storm troopers in Portland, efforts to get the USPO to not do its job so mail-in ballots would not arrive in a timely fashion, deciding to reroute billions away from fighting the pandemic are just a few examples. Kushner and Hope Hicks: leading the federal team to curb the pandemic!
Lest we forget, trump isn't only fighting for re-election, he's fighting to avoid criminal prosecution and possible conviction and incarceration. 
Adam Schiff's words following the Senate's vindication of trump following impeachment without holding a trial are prophetic and I'm paraphrasing: he can do a lot of damage before the next president is sworn in. Ya think?
His incompetency has already cost the lives of thousands.
Oh yes: Governor Newsom personally thanks you, Mr. President for your helping California. Thanks too to Jared and Hope. What would our country do without them?"
2020-07-19 15:12:43,Trump leads the mass media around instead of the mass media reporting the reality we need to understand to manage ourselves. We can use testing to reopen our society and to greatly reduce the spread of the pandemic by identifying who needs to stay home for two weeks and who can be out and interacting. Instead the news is about Trump’s inane claim that more testing creates more cases. It’s looney tunes instead of news.
2020-07-19 15:41:10,"People follow leaders, yes but they should understand their

2020-07-19 14:52:54,"The whole world knows Trump has been a colossal failure in taking the critical federal action to combat this pandemic.

And the numbers are only going to continue to get worse as Trump completely abandons the American people and ignores the skyrocketing increase in cases and loss of life.

But what America has to be most concerned about is Trump's two insanely alarming actions this week.

Trump is not only cutting funding for critically needed Covid testing, he has taken over control of the daily reporting of Covid cases to manipulate results in any fashion he chooses."
2020-07-19 15:10:17,"I marvel that so many Americans continue to revere Dr. Fauci. This distant observer can't help but wonder if maybe the good doctor has grown far too used to seeing his face on television and being in the spotlight. If he feels he is doing ""good"" by staying on Trump's team, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise."

It's discouraging that many educated readers here seem to embrace such articles even though they have surely been trained in critical thinking, scientific methodology, empiricism, etc..  Such hostile press articles rarely acknowledge that MOST outcome statistical variance that they use to criticize this administration, e.g. death rates, are INDEPENDENT of Trump and his particular policies and would likely occur under ANY administration.  Tabloid news readers don't want to know this.  They want a villain... and a simple world were they are the on the right side.  Despite their educations, NYT readers avoid scratching too deep to the narratives that Trump is responsible for most of the injustice, inequality and suffering in America today.  In reality, most of this happened well before Trump and often under their own political party's watch - largely because they're afraid to scratch too deep... afterall they might see themselves differently."
2020-07-19 15:13:19,Withholding $50 billion for testing unless schools are opened is Ukraine revisited. Except that it will cost 10’s of thousands of American lives.

2020-07-19 14:56:11,"Let's be clear: the response to this crisis has not been ""politicized"" in the sense that there are two legitimate sides making political arguments.  That's another PC motivated misnomer that the corporate press is using, another false ""both sidesism.""  

The binary in this crisis is public health and science versus a political party that has appropriated the crisis as one more tool for their ends.  Taking shelter from a natural disaster isn't political; it's basic survival instinct.  Using a natural disaster for personal gain, to manipulate, steal and cheat is the worst, lowest kind of politics.  It is immoral."
2020-07-19 15:11:28,"Hardly a critique of a well-reported article, but it strikes this reader that there were three distinct items that played in to all the decision-making here and they appear not to be mentioned by their more accessible names here. 1) The rather instantaneous understanding by the President that even the slightest diminishment of the economy's trajectory was a profoundly perilous moment for his re-election prospects.  2) The President's seething as TV time for others went up - Fauci, Cuomo, etc.  3) The belief that his brand was mostly about his 'look' and that a mask was not a good look.  For this reader, it's the Unified Theory applied to all analysis of what went wrong here."

This did not need to happen, we have some of the finest experts in the world. As Angela Merkel said “As we are experiencing firsthand, you cannot fight the pandemic with lies and disinformation any more than you can fight it with hate or incitement to hatred. The limits of populism and denial of basic truths are being laid bare."" Competent leadership here could have led to a German, Italian, New Zealand… recovery, instead we will show the world just how broken we are.

The decision to relax social distancing policies once we pass the initial peak and should therefore expect to follow the same downward trajectory was not just an informed decision that had tragic, unexpected results. It was a patently reckless decision made by officials who willfully disregarded the available data in order to pursue a short-sighted political agenda that predictably failed in every way."

My mom lives in Tucson. She's in her mid-80s and I haven't seen her for months because I did not want to bring the virus down from Washington State, an early epicenter.

I wish her Republican neighbors had one one-hundredth of the concern I have for her life. But they don't. They just keep on watching Fox News which denies climate science, hates on Democrats like me, tries to blame the outbreak on peaceful protests where most people wore masks instead of Trump rallies where no one does.

2020-07-19 15:24:55,"This is an interesting article that sketches briefly how inexperienced sycophants try to avoid responsibility for a pandemic while their boss, the President of the U.S. and an infantile playactor who makes made-for-TV decisions until reality forces him to abdicate responsibility and at the same time his grandiose ego makes it impossible for anyone to successfully fight the virus and save lives.

How WH staff reacted to the challenge of the pandemic needs much more fleshing out. Dr. Birx is described as wandering around the White House with charts and graphs, trying to convince people pandemic models show an elusive downturn is in sight and trying to persuade staffs she misguidedly believed could influence Trump to be more responsible, work with health experts and convince the public to follow their guidelines.  Of course, she couldn’t.  He can’t work in the real world.  

Next, governors and mayors were asked to personally beg him for precious supplies and publicly thank him, allowing him to play the noble hero.  Again, his greed and ego got in the way and cracks in supply lines became public as sycophants took kickbacks and allowed double dealing.

Trump’s Presidency is an over-sized melodrama where he is both the paranoid victim with limitless enemies and bellicose bully who can conquer all.   It’s all in his head.  The real parts that he doesn’t know how to control just don’t exist for him.  The real, terrible story of Trump’s mad Presidency is horrible and tragic."

2020-07-19 15:45:52,"Trump lacks all qualities needed in an effective leader.  Most striking is his lack of the courage to fail.  He will never take responsibility for anything that might turn out bad (a;though he readily takes credit for good outcomes he had nothing to do with).  He is deeply insecure and unable to risk the chance of being blamed for anything.  As a result of this limitation, he cannot lead himself out of a paper bag, let alone lead anyone else.  The pattern has been very clear since 2016:  step 1 in response to a crisis:  find some way to deflect blame onto someone, anyone, else.  Eventually we will probably hear from Trump how Hillarly's emails caused the pandemic, unless it was something Obama did.  Logic suggests Trump's failure to respond to the pandemic is the major barrier to control of the virus.  But logic has no place in TrumpWorld."

We need new legislation that will prevent someone as dangerous as Trump from ever being elected in the first place - make it mandatory for anyone entering the race to release their tax returns, full financial disclosure and business contacts for starters, plus a full medical and - crucially - psychological exam to qualify for running.

Donald Trump’s ugly and divisive campaign strategy during 2016 should have made clear to American voters Trump’s idea of leadership would be the exact opposite of effective. Like it or not the United States federal government plays critical role in trying to maintain necessary balance in an extremely complex world. Poor understanding of that role not only risks domestic financial markets, as if money and the economy are all that is important to future prosperity in this country, the predictable utter incompetence and willful ignorance demonstrated by this duly elected leader and his revolving door administration, including inexperienced, unqualified family members, risks permanently destroying what was our enviable quality of life.

But we need to lock down collectively for four to eight weeks, wear masks, social distance, help Americans and small businesses with $ during this time, stop politicizing every aspect, stop the spread, stop the insane selfish destructive behavior of some leaders and many citizens and on and on.  But Trump is clearly incapable of doing so.  And not a single Republican in Congress has shown an ounce of courage or patriotism these past 3 yrs and none will confront the incompetent lunatic in the WH.  So we rely on governors and mayors of both parties and fervently hope the margin of a Biden victory is so massive to overcome the cheating, disinformation campaign, voter suppression and authoritarian style chaos that awaits us the next few months.

Yet in the very next paragraph the Times reports that:

""The number of new cases has now surged far higher than the previous peak of more than 36,000 a day in mid-April. On Thursday, there were more than 75,000 confirmed new cases, a record.""

Many experts believe that there were more total cases this spring and the ""record"" for confirmed cases does not mean we set a record for total actual cases.

This is a simple point. Acknowledging that COVID may have been more widespread this spring does not excuse any of the very valid criticisms made of Trump's failed leadership.

His success was to sell his name that grew in value only because he got famous for play acting as a success on a horrible ""reality"" TV show?  There is no great mystery of his failure as a president.  This is a man who was installed and puppeted by a cabal of Kochs and company, Russia, neoGOP gerrymandering and apathetic voters.  What is a mystery, is why Americans have ignored the continued violations against the Constitution, his cognitive decline, his malignant narcissism, his obstructionism and his murderous policies."

In a nutshell,  he and his enablers have fanned the flames of this deadly and freakish virus, callously not caring about the vast increase in death.  After all, they are not in his voting base, his mirror mirror on the wall cult.
  
To go back, which becomes redundant and exhausting, he disbanded a pandemic task force  Obama had formed.  He did not provide us with the WHO covid test, considered the gold standard and used by 60 plus countries  being  developed in Germany in January or February.

Even the title of this article does not take this into account.  To describe his actions as a ""failure"" is way off the mark.  His actions are purposeful and a lot worse than that.  It may look like he has failed, but in Trump's world that is not the case.  He is acting out his mental illness in ways that we cannot fathom.  He revels in his behavior.  It is time to stop thinking of him as someone who will ever act normally.  He is achieving an objective to which we are not privy, even if that objective is obviously undermining his reelection efforts.  People who are profoundly mentally do this sort of thing all of the time.  It is critical now, more than ever, that we put his mental illness in a proper perspective."

But what are we to do if our president a) does nothing in good faith b) has zero ability to lead, except towards his own selfish, nefarious ends and c) is willfully ignorant about the Constitution?

The fact that Birx wandered the halls with her power points (of course!) tells me that she and Trump are two of a kind when it comes to neediness.

To course-correct on the pandemic is to admit failure, which is something Trump's damaged psyche can't tolerate. He is governing by pathology -- not strategy, ideology or even politics, except when political interests align with his bottomless narcissistic needs.

His legendary laziness is starkly apparent as he plays golf, tweets and obsesses over cable TV while his constituents die in the hundreds of thousands.

The extent of his creative vision is limited to schemes to deflect reaponsibility in order to cover for his own ineptitude and malevolence.

His listed ""achievements"" boil down to tax cuts benefiting a handful of űber-rich Americans and executive orders that gut environmental protections, health care, and whatever shred of humanity still exists in federal immigration policy.

Not even the debt-busting tax cuts of 2018 should be credited to him. All he did was to sign legislation that was wholly hatched by Congress. Literally, he lifted a finger to hold a pen and nothing more.

As far as human beings go, people get sick and die all the time.  Conservatives know, those people can spend their money better than the government.  Those people can take care of themselves better than the government. Americans have voted for decades, since Reagan for more Freedom, and they got it.  If they cannot handle that Freedom, it is their own fault. Conservative voters can and do.  It is liberals only that flounder helplessly when it comes to taking care of their own lives. Conservatives know that the poor are poor because they deserve it.  Even poor conservatives know it and vote to continue this existence. 
Trump and the GOP has acted PERFECTLY.  Following EXACTLY the policies they preached and practiced for decades.  Americans simply do not want what liberals want.

You are missing the point and the whole truth here. Yes the president is trying to shirk his responsibility and put the blame on someone else. But the reality here is that the entirety of teh GOP is 100%b behind this policy. they have been gagging for an opportunity like this pandemic to do something like this to us. They hate our government this is an opportunity to use the incompetent they put in office to shut it down and force teh lie they keep telling about how states are supposed to stand on their own without the feds in national emergencies come true. 

The idea of a unified national government is the antithesis of the lie about ""states rights"" the confederate republicans behind this attack on our nation are trying to sell. They are trying to recreate the confederacy with the lies used to stop reconstruction and impose Jim Crow.

""The White House has finally had it with the incompetence and partisanship of the CDC. It has ordered all data on COVID-19 to be sent directly to the Department of Health and Human Services bypassing the CDC completely.

""The latest blunder, and possibly the final straw is the discovery that the CDC has been lumping positive tests for COVID-19 virus and antibodies into one number: 

The CDC and several state health departments have been reporting COVID-19 diagnostic tests and antibody tests as one grand tally, rather than keeping their results separate, The Atlantic reported. 

Reporting these numbers as a lump sum, rather than two distinct data points, presents several major issues.

""Namely, combining the numbers could make America’s diagnostic testing capabilities and testing rates appear higher than they actually are, according to The Atlantic. And as the tests serve profoundly different purposes, “positive” results from either test cannot be interpreted in the same way. Reporting all the positive results together, as one number, could skew our understanding of how many new COVID-19 cases emerge over time -- a crucial metric to help control outbreaks and lockdowns as states begin reopening.""*

Add this to the hollowing out of the EPA, the Gestapo tactics by federal marshalls in Portland, Oregon, the silent approval of Russian bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the November election will be a watershed mark for the future of our country.  The American people are facing three dangerous viruses simultaneously; The Pandemic, President Donald Trump and the contagious sinking economy.

But in this case that man happens to be Donald Trump who as president, was not only derelict in his duty as chief executive, but is now inadvertently responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans because of his lack of proactive action ,particularly at the very beginning of this pandemic. Lying may work politically at times ,but it doesn’t save lives when we are in the middle of a pandemic. This reprehensible non action, is not only not worthy of reelection, it is deserving  of an indictment for involuntary manslaughter.￼ Trading the lives and safety of Americans, for the” spin” that might lead to political survival is one of the most disgusting acts that any leader in America has ever perpetrated. Only an idiot would not understand that the lives and safety of Americans and the well-being of our economy are not mutually exclusive issues.May he always be an example for American voters and for presidents in the future so that we may never forget that we witnessed for four years , the very worst that was brought to bear in the person of Donald Trump ."

I note that when governors and mayors lose control of their states and cities to rioters -  it’s “hands off” to federal agents to step in and fix their problems caused by their incompetence.  Mostly blue - elected officials.

By deploying anonymous federal troops like our own secret Gestapo to round up peaceful demonstrators on the streets of Portland, the federal government is inspiring those demonstrators to become more aggressive, thereby exacerbating the situation to evolve into a holocaust that threatens to affect larger populations of Americans. We must resist this nihilistic gesture on the part of a leader we acquired through our constitutionally appointed electors. We must reform and devise a new way of leading ourselves to insure our own survival and to form a “more perfect government.” Trump’s pretense of making America great again must be replaced by a major effort to make America better than what our talented but flawed founders envisioned."

He has taken command of nothing but trying to divide Americans. He has been the most shameful excuse for a president in the history of the nation. A ""disgrace"" is too gentle a term to place on this loser. Anyone who votes to re-elect Donald Trump in November is committing an act of Treason.

NO! because it is not the seventh-day of the week commonly called Saturday.

As for me and my house we will worship the Son not the sun! Soon it will be declared that men are offending god because of the violation of the Sun-day sabbath, that this sin has brought on calamities which will not cease until the sun day shall be strictly enforced by law.

At what point do living Ex-Presidents discard tradition stand up TOGETHER and say, enough? 

When do they say that these are beyond extraordinary times. 
That if abiding by “tradition” means spectating from the sidelines with a touching op-ed or two, while the country is being ripped to shreds by the very office they held - they will no longer abide by it. 

The White House may not have a leader. But this country does have living leaders. I don’t believe that they believe their responsibility, their duty to this country ended on January 20th of a particular year.

If Deborah Birx had treated a patient as she's mismanaged the country, we'd take away her medical license because she'd be classified as a threat to public safety.  

Birx did the equivalent of telling a cancer patient's family it was ""just a little stomach bug"" and running around like some deranged Mary Poppins in the West Wing with ""a spoonful of sugar"" merrily dispensing half-truths to please her audience of one - and completely neglecting the 330,000,000 charges that were depending on her.

But she's not the only one.  Mark Meadows is a dangerous and incompetent fool.  He continued to lead this insular and incompetent band off the cliff to please Trump.  Hope Hicks is about the last person who should have an opinion on anything related to public health.  Jared Kushner is the embodiment of the Dunning-Kreuger effect.  The problem of surrounding yourself with fawning family and the assistant who rubs your temples and coos ""oh, everything's all right"" is that when they do it and the house is on fire people die.

140,000 people are dead.  Trump idolizes Kim Jong Un.  Does he have any idea what Kim would do to him and his band of misfit morons if they killed 140,000 North Koreans through arrogance and negligence?  I'll give you a hint - it would be far worse than saying ""your models are too rosy."""

2020-07-19 16:14:35,"One wonders how this leaderless political machine survives as it lunges from one crisis after another, especially Covid-19, all driven by selfish politics rather than science.

Compare the situation in the States of America (intended reshape to follow Trump's edict that the States are now on their own) to the more independent Countries exposed to the virus.
 For example in Europe and Scandinavia most of whom are well on their way to reducing the immediate consequences of the pandemic despite an occasional hiccup, there is an example to be recognised and followed.

There is nothing to be lost by recognizing this situation and sharing examples of skills and experience, however Trump is busy keeping his skirts clean by defaming those who don't share his politic."
2020-07-19 16:46:56,"All the facts reported in this article are true but irrelevant. The fundamental fact about our situation was missing. It is this: the American people revolted in 2016 and consciously put the most unqualified person in history into the White House. This seems to have been done with the purpose of destroying a government that was widely hated across many sections of the country. The destruction this decision caused is ongoing and has effected every aspect of a once functioning government. One of the things destroyed was the governments ability to effectively and scientifically deal with a pandemic and the specific failures in that regard are well covered in this article. 
However, this magnitude of failure can be found in almost all areas of government and their combined neglect is contributing to a total and previously unimaginable breakdown of the norms and safe guards that all citizens have believed to be permanent. The shock of the unimaginable is what is roiling across the country as we are now forced to come to grips with fears that previously only third world countries have experienced. The corona virus is nothing compared to the shared loss of an idealized America that is shaking our belief in democracy itself. What we are experiencing is a warning that complacency might kill us. The death toll is a stark reminder that we are not special and that our American dream is not immortal. That without the cooperation of other Americans there is no solution at all."
2020-07-19 16:16:40,"Trump’s handling of the virus has been a difficult balancing act....the health of our citizens vs the health of our economy. I’m sure if you were to take a poll between “employees” and “employers” their opinions during the first 6 weeks of lockdown, the majority would agree it was the Right thing to do for our country.  However, after the six week isolation the economy was taking its toll on every business owner and corporation.  Trump was right. We have to get the economy going again. We have to get people back to work. We Can’t let these businesses fail.How else are we all to survive? We absolutely had to open  up.  In my opinion his only failure was not mandating masks when outside or when unable to social distance in whatever environment you were in."

This article should be clearly-labeled as analysis or an opinion."
2020-07-19 16:01:53,"We remember quite vividly the day of Trumps pivot, the sudden passing of responsibility to the states, and recognized exactly what it was, that he was thinking that he was  shedding of his personal responsibility for a situation out of control.
Our only fault with this article is that it has taken three months to expose and publish.
During these three months we have often wondered if we were so ignorant that we alone imagined these failures of our Federal and state governments.
Here in Florida, our governor is much better than Trump at misrepresenting the Covid data to justify the Presidents performance, but we hope most Florida citizens are self informed enough to see through his exaggerations and recognize the party line for what it is. 
Their sole aim is to shift responsibility for failure and promote reelection.
So while this New York Times may be too late to save lives lost,we hope it will open peoples eyes and minds in November.
Having voted a straight Republican ticket last election to avoid Hillary,we will vote a mostly straight Democratic ticket to help rid us of Trump.
I do thank all the NYT staff who worked on this article. A very well written , informative and well documented expose of our governments failure to protect the health and safety of its citizens."

The above statement seems to validate Mr. Trump’s view."
2020-07-19 16:35:50,"The original guidance given by health officials together with a greater appreciation of how the virus, (which causes Covid-19) is transmitted might suggest that effective mask wearing provides a greater component to retarding the spread of the virus than any other measure including social distancing, surface cleaning, hand washing, etc. However, questioning current and past pronouncements and guidance may ultimately lead to questioning whether the closing down of businesses was truly necessary in the first place. Something similar can be said of testing (the ultimate beneficiary may be the testing company). The point here being that before calling out “failures,”  make certain, that even with hindsight, successes (i.e., successful measures against the disease) are identified. Further, don’t conflate the benefits of wearing a mask with social distancing. This may be apparent from the latest revelation concerning aerosolized virus particles."
2020-07-19 10:10:07,"The cumulative effects of shutting the country down has been far worse than the number of deaths, which are only one-tenth of the number that is told to us by the media, from this so called virus which is actually a bad bacteria. That being said, by cumulative effects I am referring to Americans going hungry to a far greater degree now than six months ago. A suicide rate which is six times worse now than six months ago. Broken families now worse. Children not being allowed to play with children. Old people in nursing homes not being allowed to see their children just before they die. We are basically told not to love others anymore, instead we are told to stay six feet apart. We cannot see a smile on someone's face anymore. Oh if Trump had of only been listened to instead of Fauci we would be much better off today."
2020-07-19 12:06:09,"Not a single randomized controlled trial with verified outcome has been able to detect a statistically significant advantage of wearing a mask, when it comes to preventing infectious viral illness. If there were any significant advantage to wearing a mask to reduce infection risk to either the wearer or others in the vicinity then it would have been detected in at least one of these trials, yet there is no sign of such a benefit. Therefore you are not helping people around you by wearing a mask, and you're not helping yourself avoid the disease by not wearing a mask."

          perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.”

Correction: THE GREATEST FAILURE of presidential leadership in generations.

Trump has made many, many huge mistakes...all centered around his extreme narcissism...which has cost the country hundreds of thousands of lives.

This is gross incompetence. Malpractice on a scale unheard of.

Of course, we’re all waiting for November because we’ve all given up.

I say no! Trump should be imprisoned and hanged for being a traitor. He should be pulled from the Oval Office immediately. From the virus, to Ukraine, to bounties on American soldiers heads that he refuses to denounce.

The resulting catastrophe (32,000 plus dead to date--6th in the world) was exacerbated by their tardy response and wishful thinking. Not to mention their petty, juvenile bickering.

The fact that Cuomo can emerge from this as a heroic champion of science is proof positive of how far down the rabbit hole we have gone and how desperate we are in the U.S. for leadership--even mediocre leadership will suffice, apparently."
2020-07-19 12:51:34,"Failing. Maybe the reason lies in the failure to use anything natural to improve immune response. Government, the medical establishment and the media have turned a blind eye towards anything that is not of pharmaceutical origin.  In my eyes, the biggest failure is one of ignoring nature. 

I won’t bother putting links to research because it likely won’t be published if I do. It’s happened already.  Wake up, look at nutrition and herbs.  Help is there but only if our eyes are wide open and minds are willing to accept something not created in a test tube."

Americans, by contrast, began backing away by late April from what social distancing efforts they had been making, egged on by Mr. Trump.”

An example of irresponsible journalism. The blame rests entirely on us American people who feel so arrogant about our “rights” that we only follow guidelines or not depending on our “feelings”. Not on Trump whom you continually blame. In France, there is now a €275 fine for going out without a mask in public enclosed spaces. It was reinstated today. Both Democrats and Republicans believe in a recommendation for not going out without a mask rather than a mandatory order like in the republics of Europe and the rest of the world.￼￼ We are not talking recommending, rather “ordering,” but you continually blame Trump for this purely American belief.￼ The leader is good, the problem is with the Americans who do not want to follow the leader, so you can’t have it both ways. He has given very good orders, and left those orders in the hands of the state leaders who are weak and often Democrat. However the biggest problem is the unruly American people who refuse to follow orders.￼￼The other problem is your daily unremitting articles about how bad Trump is: look at yourselves in the mirror, journalists.￼"

They are the only entity in our Government that has the authority to detain and even place in mandatory quarantine those shown to be infected with a SARS infection or reasonably suspected to be a carrier of the disease.  For all sorts of reasons this did not happen.  Yes, States have role here but the lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak and officially published by CDC were not followed, again for all sorts of reasons just too numerous to tell.

2020-07-19 16:52:17,"This article is simply a hit job, just to create a narrative that Trump is a failure. In fact, from the beginning, the Trump team's motto for managing the pandemic crisis was: ""locally executed, state managed and federally supported"". This is still the guiding principle. Trump managed the crisis better than anybody in this country and any major country that has similar circumstances.  

Liberal pundits and experts agree in unison that the current spike that started to happen from the middle of June is the result of business openings happened in the end of April and beginning of May, but it is not factually correct. The following example as stated in the article shows the spike: In Austin hospitals, the Covid-19 cases at intensive care units jumped from three in mid-May to 185 by early July. 

Usually, you get sick or get okay within 14 days after corona infection. That means business opening happened in early May was not the main reason why Austin hospitals had sudden spike of corona patients. It appears to be mainly due to the large scale protests that started at the end of May. Also, due to parties by young people without precaution. This is the reason why CA started to see spike, even though it reopened only at the end of May and under strict guidance.  

There is no real shift in Trump's strategies to deal with the virus. The current spike will be put out by the states with the support of Trump and the outcome will be much better than what we saw in NY."

Dr.Birx in her role as the co ordinator of the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief squandered  $1.3 billion US tax money encouraging Africans to avoid AIDS by practicing abstinence and fidelity which studies have established did not measurably change sexual behavior and was largely wasted, but she continues to employ evangelical leaders Shepherd Smith and his wife Anita, whose influence over health care issues well beyond abstinence education. Last year, President Donald Trump announced that PEPFAR must now follow the so-called Mexico City Policy, which bans foreign, non-governmental organizations from using their funds for abortion-related services such as counseling.True PEPFAR has saved millions, but millions more lives could have been saved without the political  and religious zealots involvement.For Birx , Pence and Trump the task force is not there to save lives but a political force to save Trump."

The buck stops at Trump's desk surrounded by his many people, unqualified family and those specifically vetted to confirm his whims, ignorance bias and imperatives. Unfortunately Dr. Birx and her supposed authority  is included. Trump runs the presidency as self promotion- no different from his other endeavors, failures. During this time of prolongation of Covid19 people have died, are dying and are suffering, physically and economically from reckless selfish obsequiousness across the board, from the GOP in Congress to Dr. Birx. She should have left the crew awhile ago if she has any integrity."

Many of us saw this happening in real time, and knew that Trump's own bizarre actions and decisions would cost tens of thousands of lives. It is good to see the New York Times, so often in support of the President's decisions, cover the details of his historically massive mistakes. 

Did racism factor into Trump's decision in January - March not to take the novel coronavirus seriously, and to lie to the American public about it? Perhaps, as Trump is known to be a virulent racist, he had some knowledge that BIPOC communities would be hardest hit in terms of deaths from this awful disease."

Sitting next to her was a man of principal who would not bend to Trump's will. Dr. Fauchi should have been her role model. Moreover, he was far more experienced and recognized as the world's premier expert on infectious diseases. It seems to me that she wanted to replace Fauchi in that arena. 
But, in the end it all comes down to the largest little man that ever sat in the oval office. Trump's insecurity and ego makes him totally incapable of leading, especially in a time of crisis.

What is most disturbing about this in-depth analysis is the place of a world-respected public health expert like Dr. Deborah Birx in contributing significantly to the administration’s failure to effectively lead us out of the most deadly disaster in our nation‘s history.

When I look back at Dr Birx’s press interview on the White House lawn following Trump’s suggestion that people inject or ingest bleach to combat the virus, it becomes clear that she was already part of the problem rather than the solution. Instead of responding as a public health official who would naturally denounce such a suggestion, Birx justified Trump by saying, “When he gets new information, he likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue — and so that’s what dialogue he was having. I think he just saw the information at the time immediately before the press conference and he was still digesting that information.”

Even in the face of today’s rising numbers of infections and deaths of American people, Dr. Birx continues to protect her special place in the White House by using her personally manipulated data to downplay the obvious dangers when advising her boss and his inner circle.

Weary eyes watched him malign the parents of an American hero, a gold star family.  We saw him remove translators in Helsinki and stand next to Putin in front of the press declaring his belief of Russia, not the wise people serving our country.  We witnessed late in the evening Rachel Maddow breaking down, unsuccessfully holding back tears as she reported of the separation from parents and caging of children.  And how he treats journalists?  Rude, ignorant, disrespectful, lying and obfuscating.  Listening to BBC ratio last night I heard the British journalists discuss the chaos in America as we deal with a pandemic.

The good news is that the Trump administration has identified the goat, and its name is Dr. Birx. We have found where the buck stops, and the NY Times appears to be quite supportive of that premise.

The  Republicans continue to embrace this lying, delusional failure because their shrinking party has become nothing more than a personality cult dominated by anti-vaxers, conspiracy theorists, science deniers, and right wing media types pandering to these poor sods for profit.

Speaking for myself, that is not correct.  Here is an analogy that may help you understand my logic:

Do you hate garbage when you put it out by the curb for the sanitation man to haul away?  No. You are just glad to be rid of it.

Donald Trump is looking after his own interests, in his typical chaotic, meandering, way.  He thinks playing golf is a constitutional duty.  

Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our country.  He is beneath contempt.  It is a waste of my time and energy to wallow in hate for him.  I just despise him, which is a cold fact.

On November 3 We The People will let Donald know exactly what we think of him.  It won't be pretty. 

There will be time enough to celebrate when he is gone."

Trump has inflicted his own cruel, ignorant, self-aggrandizing pathologies along with a cadre of sycophants and criminals to enable his delusional illusions. Trump is not so much an aberration of dysfunctional incompetence, which he is, costing thousands of American lives, but the culmination of Republican policies and strategy since Nixon, especially Reagan to Trump. Reagan made Trump possible and the Covid-19 Pandemic has revealed America as critically dysfunctional, incompetent with a tragic indifference for human suffering and death."

2020-07-19 16:46:31,"Republicans had no problem when Trump bragged about groping women's private parts without their permission and Republicans have no problem with Trump's virulent racism. MAGA hat fans believe every word that spews from Trump's mouth. We are facing a political crisis because half of the two-party system has abandoned our nation's founding principles of fairness and the rule of law. They have corrupted the election system and with Russian aid placed an egomaniac wannabe dictator Trump in the Oval Office. 

Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th Ave. and his fans wouldn't care. That is not a lie. He has done far worse by killing tens of thousands of Americans with his insane efforts to ignore the COVID pandemic. 

Trump is a living symbol of our failed government. As tools of extreme right wing billionaires, The Republican Party leadership has systematically defiled our Constitution and our democracy to sustain power and and nourish their greed.  Republicans just don't care. That is also not a lie."

The reliance of the assessment of one expert who supports your desired outcome will always have inadequate results and always lead to failure. That’s basic business and science.  It is painfully obvious that this administration lacks the most basic understanding of either."

One central figure not getting enough attention is Jared Kushner. I’m sure he reports to Ivanka and Donald multiple times a day. (Donald is such a two faced liar. He says one thing publicly, while having others work behind the scenes to get his dirty deeds done. Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone were his hatchet men in 2016.)

There was a striking story from a few months ago where Kushner was reported denigrating Fauci’s opinions as coming from someone who isn’t much more than a glorified school nurse. This all coming from a man whose father bought his way into Harvard. And Jared serves a man whose older sister did most of his high school homework and who needed a stand-in to take his SAT’s. (Thanks to Mary Trump for those new details.)

All this was in service to Donald’s desire for re-election, his grievances over his justified impeachment and trial, and his anticipation of a smooth glide path to another coronation."

2020-07-19 17:15:28,"I can’t say that the facts in this excellent analysis come as a complete surprise, but this is the best narrative of what went on in the White House that I’ve seen. 

It’s a nice analysis, because it is very difficult to tell whether Trump’s completely incompetent, totally driven by crazy ideas, or just plain cluelessly malicious: it doesn’t necessarily occur to me that you could have guys working from demented premises, coming up with wacko plans, and THEN executing them completely incompetently. 

I’m again reminded of Charles Sykes’ great editorial of a couple years ago: Trumpists are mainly animated by their angers and their hatreds, and what comes out is a kind of nihilism that says, “Burn it all down, who cares as long as I get to hurt Them.” 

It’s pretty stunning. All Trump had to do was follow the advice he’d gotten by late January, give a couple pious speeches about how we’re gonna win and we’re all in this together, issue a few national guidelines, harangue Congress for some funding, give a half-sober report onna TV maybe once a week, wear a mask a little, and he’d be cruising. 

And a lot fewer Americans would be dead or crippled, and we’d be where we could seriously see about reopening schools in a couple months. 

This looks so much like deliberate self-sabotage that you can only come up with about two explanations. Either Trump’s got an even-deeper sump of self-loathing and hatred than we thought, or he’s beat everybody nearby down to consensual hallucination."
2020-07-19 17:17:42,"It is a very sad story that after decades of credible service Dr. Deborah Birx sold her soul to Trump just like so many members of Congress have also done.

This article confirmed in remarkable detail what many of us suspected was the disaster in the White House and what we always suspected would happen if Trump was ever faced with a national crisis.  I honestly always thought it would be a war.  We probably would have been better off if it were."

2020-07-19 17:07:30,"The permanent scarring and diminution of Dr. Birx's reputation and legacy is one of the most glaring examples of a disturbing pattern of the last 3.5 years. People who enter Trumps' orbit with glowing, or at least positive, reputations leave sullied, disgraced, and I believe history will show, forever damaged and discarded. The price for currying and retaining Trump's favor is debasement and abandonment. Not just by Trump, but by the rest of the world. Don't look for future approbations  or accomplishments from any of Trump's minions. They have already been relegated to the dustbin of history."

They're a necessary convenience with the added bonus of filling his election coffers with hundreds of millions if not billions which all be his free and clear after the election. And apparently, we can lump the GOP leadership into this basket of corruption. And we wonder why the U.S. has the largest outbreak of the virus in the world. It's crystal clear that GOP leadership is bad for our heath."

But the bottom line is that the virus is purely biological and will not follow graphs, models or opinions; it does what it does best: to infect human beings with the worst illness since 1918. 

I truly believe that the one piece of evidence that was discarded and not followed was the anecdotal evidence from countries that have kept the virus at bay and today enjoy freedoms we can only dream of: Italy, Germany, China, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and many others have done what we can only hope to replicate at this point in the pandemic.

It is not too late to start over and do it right. However, we do not have the political will to even discuss it, let alone to put the necessary remedies into action.

I believe at this point we are doomed to see infections continue to rise, deaths will accelerate, and ‘survivors’ will face life long, chronic health issues.

The second wave will be ignited by the reopening of schools; students and teachers will become infected, taking the virus home to infect parents, siblings, grandparents, friends, neighbors, co-workers and more.

A truly horrific autumn and winter await us unless somehow, miraculously, to steal a phrase from trump, we somehow find the political will to implement the hard medicine to defeat this pandemic.

I’m not hopeful"

2020-07-19 17:12:27,This falls under the category of criminal negligence.  One thing we have learned through Trump's shambolic performance is that our nation is overly dependent on one man to lead the country's response to a crisis and the framers gave us no backup plan for a situation such as this when that person wouldn't or couldn't provide the leadership the nation desperately needed.

Unlucky for us, he’s surrounded by a team of enablers who unwisely tempered much of their knowledge and some of their fears to assuage our President. 

Going from full responsibility to deferred responsibility to blaming everybody but his own administration, our President has endangered countless Americans. Except, we continue to count them as our unmasked leader chortles on about urban anarchists and monument destroyers. 

Anatomy of a Public Health Disaster might be a good title for a retrospective documentary. These reporters have written a great first draft.

2020-07-19 17:17:07,"This whole sorry episode as depicted in the NYT article should be a lesson learned in how not to handle a pandemic. It is very clear that the participants in this federal fiasco were almost completely absorbed by the necessity to prematurely open up the economy so that Trump had a chance to be re-elected on the promise of economic good times. Dr. Birx especially bears significant culpability for her rosy interpretations of the data to conform with Trump's own objectives to obtain another term.

 Without a rising economy, Trump never had a good argument to keep him president while there are many good reasons why he should be replaced.  Historians will analyze the events of 2020 and likely conclude that the country was not well served by people who placed their own self interests ahead of the interests of the nation. The blatant disregard for the welfare of the American people will undoubtedly be seen by historians as the primary reason why Trump and his party were epic failures in office."

I believe that was Trump's last time at the Task Force podium, so someone must have convinced him how off far off the track he was. At some point, doctors, have a duty to act, and too often we have seen the medical professionals on the task force and in the administration not act, or act in a way that minimized the seriousness of the crisis at hand. I realize there a political, economic and societal consequences to specific guidance from medical professionals, but at some point, it should be easy to directly and more forcefully contradict patently false information. It's like if a patient has lung cancer and supposes that continuing to smoke probably won't make things any worse- the doctor can say- no, that's not accurate, it can, and likely will get worse. The patient can still make the choice, but can be armed with realistic, science based information on which to predicate that decision."

That we have arrived at a state in this country where the president needs to be personally thanked for the government to supply testing swabs is beyond comprehension to normal people, but here we are.

And yet, Trump is the proclaimed savior to his Christian evangelist base, which celebrates Jesus as a compassionate savior of those in need of help.

Trump, his enablers in Congress, in Governors' mansions, in State Legislatures and in local offices around the country have been the modern day Nero fiddling while Rome burned. This country is being destroyed by them. Democracy is turning into autocracy, large numbers of people are dying, many people who get covid-19 and survive are left with terrible health damage, and substantial numbers of Americans are being destroyed economically. 

If it hasn't happened already, since politicians seem to live on social media, Trump and all the enablers need to be further called out and embarrassed using social media tags like DTrumpNero, MMConnellNero, RDesantisNero, LGrahamNero, etc. 

I was (past tense) a registered Republican for much of my adult life. During almost 50 years of voting I have always voted the person regardless of the Party. Not this time. On November 3rd, and then on every successive election, the Republicans (with the exception of Sen. Romney and Gov. Hogan) need to be defeated. This also applies to those Republicans who read the handwriting on the wall and then miraculously grow a spine before election day. They all need to reread their oath of office. Getting reelected is not a part of the duties of their office.

The resurgence is not the fault of re-opening too soon or any failure to test or not test.  Science is at work and as imperfect as the progress is- we have little choice but to wait.  We can wear masks and not hang out in groups but blaming officials and politicizing the crisis is not helpful. Of course the states needed to be responsible for their populations- a very reasonable approach that did not save us any more that federal mandates would have. Up beat news or gloom and doom - which would have prevented the pandemic?  Both were employed strenuously - there's no competition with the NYTs for Gloom and Doom and blaming.

Then I read that he had mentored Dr. Birx and I was briefly reassured. But the day that Trump looked at her, and asked her if we could inject bleach, and she just sat there stone faced, is the day I lost all respect for her.
Now we are all on our own. We as individuals will just have to self isolate so we won't get sick. But many people do not have that luxury, such as school teachers, grocery clerks, and other essential workers.

That is what has happened here. Only the people died in stages so it seemed more acceptable. 
But ask the families of the people who died how acceptable it is. 
Our government did nothing. They pretended to do something to help but they abandoned us when we needed them the most. They acted busy but did nothing. 
Our ""leaders' got up in front of tv cameras everyday to boast about what was being done but nothing substantial happened and then, even those ridiculous, embarrassing  updates stopped. Trump became bored with the pandemic. 

Our governors were left to fight among themselves for supplies...not to coordinate federal help together like it should have happened.

I remember listening to an interview with her outside the White House in April. This was a crucial period when it was still possible to contain the spread. She twisted herself in knots talking about the “models” to justify Trump’s agenda. It was clear then that, unlike Fauci, she was not being honest and shouldn’t be listened to.

Thousands of families are now dependent of food-bank help and millions have lost their healthcare that was linked to jobs! Florida is one of those states that already had huge numbers of people without any health care because the state refused to expand Medicaid, and left 750,000 adults with ZERO healthcare. Now millions more workers are joining that list because they have found that employee-supported healthcare is like an umbrella that melts in the rain. You lose your job, and you lose your healthcare, and almost no one can afford the COBRA temporary replacement.

The social and health affects of forced mandatory shutdowns on our entire economy and way of life vastly exceed those of the pandemic’s health effects themselves on the aged (over 60-70, or immune compromised) - something these writers seem clueless about.

Vastly better idea to protect those most at risk, than destroy an entire economy, tax base, thousands of businesses, jobs, and put ever increasing deficits and higher taxes resulting from misguided shutdowns on future generations. This article is nothing but politics and bias - end of story."

Nothing they or the Republican Senate says or does is trustworthy. Just as there needs to be bright lines between church and state, there also needs to be bright lines between medical science and advice and smarmy electioneering during a  pandemic. Brix should resign. Trump should be impeached. Again. When the mission to save the hostages in Iran crashed, Jimmy Carter essentially lost the election to another Republican crash dummy, Ronald Regan. Carter accepted his loss with grace and continued to uphold the dignity of his office and go onto to help many around the world. Trump has essentially lost the election. His rats should start booking a path off his ship. Expect no grace, no dignity, no honestly, no leadership, no help from this administration."

Several Abbott multi-unit testing machines work day and night to test everyone and everything that comes inside this bubble.  All WH staffers, cooks, janitors, servants, suppliers, secret service, office personnel, drivers, pilots, etc. take rapid tests at least once a day, sometimes several times a day.  All WH guests and visitors with their entourage also have to undergo rigorous testing.  When Mr. Trump moves, the whole dome moves with him.  It's a colossal endeavor costing millions of dollars of the taxpayer money.  
That is why Mr. Trump can stand out in all his beauty without wearing a mask and talk about millions of tests performed in the country.  All the chosen few surrounding him in the dome can freely move, smile, and crack jokes about the unlucky rest of the country outside this bubble.  There is no shame on their shining unmasked faces.  They are the participants of this exclusive reality show."

James Madison, “Father of the Constitution,” first warned, accurately, that the greatest threat to democracy would come from within.  And now, we have Trump, who calls American-citizen journalists “the enemy of the people;” who fails to confront Putin, neo-Nazis, racists; who has, all with Republican enabling, made the Justice Department his police, wiping out the work of prosecutors and juries by withdrawing convicted cases of friends and supporters from sentencing and abusing his pardon powers; and twice, so far, using unidentifiable federal officers in paramilitary uniform to attack peaceful demonstrators exercising their free-speech and assembly rights while refusing to uphold government-property display bans of the Confederate flag of U.S. traitors on those same “freedom-of-speech” grounds.

All of this, and so much more, coming from Trump, was no surprise at all to many of the 3-million+ more voters who didn’t cast their votes for him than those who did.  The turn of events in 2021 will be equally critical for America's democracy as it will for the vaccine that can likewise rid us of the pandemic."

But, he added, it is also true that asset price trends are difficult to predict. “The price of an asset, like a house or a stock, reflects not only your beliefs about the future, but you’re also betting on other people’s beliefs,” he observed. “It’s these hierarchies of beliefs  these behavioral factors  that are so hard to model.”

My son has been living in Italy for the last year and has been telling me about the Italian efforts since the pandemic began.  People were not allowed out of their homes except for very limited reasons.  They could go to grocery stores in their own neighborhoods but not to the ones across town; there were strict curfews and substantial fines for being caught in violation.  It was tough, but Italy went from many to no cases in a relatively short period of time.   

By comparison, people in the US are not held responsible for violating stay at home and mask orders.  The result is that we have far surpassed Italy in deaths and numbers of cases per capita.  There are so many idiots defying mask and social distancing orders that the rest of us will have to stay home and limit trips outside until an effective vaccine is wIdely available.  That could be another year or more.  

I’m 79 years old, and I’m not happy about spending so much of whatever time I have left confined to my home with little social contact.  I’m not happy that my 16 year old granddaughter is missing out on her crucial high school experience.  At least we are healthy.   So many others have it so much worse.   I want to cry."

On one day he accused of cooking up special deals with pharmaceutical companies, and on the next day he is accused of walking away from everything.

Even with his extra special dose of bi-polar schizophrenia, he can't be doing both at the same time.

And remember when he was assaulted by the Liberal press for shutting off entry into the county by foreigners?  Now he is blamed, by the same people, for not shutting everything down.

These attacks may be amusing to Liberals, who rightly, would never vote for Trump anyway, but they tend to push voters who are sitting on the fence over to the Republican side, because they make little sense, and reek of bile.

The most important thing is to influence people who probably won't be voting for Biden; not to play to people like myself, who are totally against Trump, and will be voting for Biden on November 3rd no matter what is printed."

First, I am not defending President Trump. The man is not an effective leader, and is divisive, to but it mildly. At the same time, many of his policies have been appropriate.  The relentless dissing of Trump by the Times is counterproductive.

Next, lets not forget: the enemy here is the coronavirus. It is a bad actor, and there's not much any politician could have done that would have changed the long term outcome.  A country or state that is ""in control"" today will likely see a surge tomorrow.

Next, responsibility for public health largely rests with states and counties. We may wish to change our laws, but that's how they stand today.  It's also noteworthy that the Oregon is today suing the Federal government for interference with state prerogatives on protest management, and the Times sides with Oregon.

The Times accuses Trump of ignoring the risks of the virus, and putting other priorities first. Which is, of course, exactly what the Times itself did, with its long series of editorials and columns encouraging mass protects against racism. Mass protests which include shouting and which are impossible to contact trace are a very effective way of spreading respiratory viruses, and likely contributed to the current wave of surges, though the extent is not known.

Depicting Drs. Birx and Fauci as opponents is counterproductive and misleading journalism.  The truth is there are no magic answers to the pandemic."

Democrats tell us that federal test and trace should be done to open up responsibly, here there and everywhere. Fauci says that this hasn’t and won’t work. 

Democrats say that it’s all about federal delay and foot dragging. They tell us that this caused tens of thousands of deaths, which is entirely speculative. Yes, there was one rough study about this, but that study warned  that its findings were unproven. 

Democrats call for federal leadership while the scientific community views the problem as local. The Democrats ignore science to better put all the blame on Trump.

Even if the scope of knowledge was limited to only the period of his candidacy in the primary, there was more than enough evidence of what a nightmare this would be.

A top down approach isn’t always good.  Sometimes we can learn when different States take different approaches.  This will soon be true of school re-openings.  A “national approach” from the Trump administration would deprive us of data to be learned from different methods. Such data will be valuable, and undoubtedly will inform future decisions about schools. 

We should also accept that things won’t always go well, perhaps even for reasons we don’t yet understand.  For example, the virus seems to be spreading now in States where closings and mask orders were delayed or not tried at all, but it is also is spreading in States like my State of California, where early pro-active closings were ordered. 

It is too early to say that any of this was or wasn’t a “failure.”  It is too early to even say that we have the benefit of hindsight.

That was and has been their ""Cure"" and response to this pandemic ...a response that could not be more helpful and facilitating to the virus at the center of this man made disaster.

Nowhere else in the world has a country's leader (and his minions) acted so compliantly to help a mindless virus wreak as much havoc, death and destruction as much as it has and continues to do and ever could or would if it had just been met with leadership that took it seriously or was even slightly serious in wanting to defeat it as common sense and decency has always assumed...until now.

The fact that America is even willing to wait till November to throw out these failures is disturbing. The fact that they have as many supporters they still do and could even win the upcoming election is beyond all reason and defies all logic.

It is the failure of the Cabinet to protect the country by enacting the 25th Amendment, if only to save American lives unnecessarily lost to Covid mismanagement.

""Mr. Kushner made it clear that the federal help would hinge on the governor doing him a favor. 'The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, had to call Donald Trump, and ask him for the swabs' recalled the adviser, Bob Kocher, an Obama-era White House health care official.""

Just as in the Ukraine bribery scheme, Trump's sole concern was generating positive press for himself, so he could bask in the glory of winning the upcoming election. 

But this time, it wasn't merely the lives of allied soldiers resisting Russian aggression and desperate for aid we had promised and which Congress already approved that Trump withheld in exchange for promised public flattery; it was equipment needed to save the lives of American citizens--which included members of his own political base. 

While Trump has absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts, Section 4 of the 25th Amendment makes clear that he can be removed for the malfeasance and misfeasance described in this reporting: 

""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.""

The stark reality is that until Biden is inaugurated as US President then and only then can a truly serious and united effort both federal and state based on science-- not quackery begin. Perhaps then I'll stop feeling like I'm living inside a Stephen King horror novel.

The character of ""the Great Divider"" Trump, revealed in the details here was the dominant force, because those who form the virus policies with him take their cues from him.  They do what pleases him, and they well know what does.

Without loyalty to truth, there was no focus on testing, no realization that the economy was dependent upon pubic health, no willingness to change course when necessary, no acknowledgment that politics serves public health and not the reverse.  Our national disgrace of a president doesn't have the values dedicated to truth-telling and reality, so that his and his advisers' failure on virus policy was almost surely pre-ordained.

The sole bright side of this is that the virus reveals Trump's character and ineptitude in a way his other policies don't, because virus policy directly ties to public safety and is roughly reflected in the numbers of cases and deaths.  While it may seem crude to say, the virus is God's gift to America that reveals his failures and disgrace for so many more to see than would otherwise do so."

Of course, presidents try to contribute to the public's belief that they are in charge of the federal government. This perception creates the illusion of presidential government. No amount of public relations, however, can disguise adverse conditions. If they are really as powerful as they claim to be, they will be held responsible for policy failures as well as policy successes.

My very unpolitical mindset started noticing it with Barack Obama in the office and how it was apparent the discord in politics was more focused on not agreeing with or supporting the president because the color of his skin. A completely immature and ignorant mindset in general from my perspective. And the division and lack of respect for others is so poor in our country right now that someone with the blatant narsasistic personality of Donald Trump is able to get elected as President of the United States. It is truly a sad time in these Un-united States right now"

How early in the year (or in late 2019) did our intelligence apparatus know how bad the pandemic was in China? and who in the administration was aware and responsible for having a response? We know mid March was far too late to avoid a serious crisis. A response could have come much much sooner.

Republican legislators and governors have it within their power to either impeach him, pressure him into resigning, or pressure Pence and the cabinet into sidelining him and acting in his place.  They should act out of self-interest, if not from a sense of duty to their constituents; being seen as taking effective action on testing, tracing, masking, and setting national pandemic protocols between now and November 8 may lessen their losses.

2020-07-20 03:03:01,"There is no doubt that Trump fiddled while America burned.  His leadership in the fight against Covid-19 was abysmal.  Worse, he still doesn't get it.

But two observations need to be made. First, NYT reporters are not the right people to criticize him. For all of his presidency -- and even during the transition -- the Times has waged an unrelenting war against him. Who is going to believe the paper now? Indeed, when will the Times step up and take responsibility for the atrocious reporting that launched the wild goose chase over Trump's supposed collusion with Russia? 

The second observation is that the blame for America's failure to address the crisis was not limited to Trump. From the beginning opportunities to prepare for the onslaught were squandered. There we the fatuous evidence-free reassurances given by leading epidemiologists. There were their lies about masks. Almost every agency in the fight experienced a catastrophic meltdown -- all the alphabet soup. The testing fiasco, the innumerable mickey-mouse regulations that tied down the Gulliver of US industry. 

And just today, we learn that the FDA has finally signed off on (made in the USA) pooled testing. Finally! The U.S. military started using  the method in the 1940s. China was using it in May, and  Israel and Thailand too. It is unconscionable that it took so long.

There is not even the first step in making a policy- a coherent grasp on reality. On March 30th during a call with governors, the governor of Montana said that without federal  assistance the State would soon run out of tests. Later on that same call, Trump said he hadn’t heard of any problems with the number of tests. This is the problem with the federal response  in a nutshell.I am a health care worker and we are still reusing N95 masks. There can be no coherent policy if you don’t listen to people on the front lines who know what is happening at the moment. models or no models. This administration is not doing that and people are dying. We are not even handling the crisis right now, let alone preparing what it will be months from now."

So when February of this year rolled around, the capability of the federal government to deal with the pandemic had been effectively crippled.  Of course, Trump's refusal to listen to anything he didn't want to hear, and consequently his refusal to take any action whatever,  didn't help."

Reuters poll says 83 percent of registered Republicans approve of his management, which would lead anyone half-awake to question their capacity for independent thought and analysis.

If one adjusts the numbers for population (as one should), CA is handling the pandemic very well, especially outside of the LA Basin. Even counting the LA Basin, CA is well below the national average in both infections and deaths. Not sure what this reader is referring to. 

The reader may be on to something, even so. Though NY has improved dramatically, NY and NJ are still much higher than any other states (even higher than most COUNTRIES) in both infections and deaths. They ""drag"" the average up."

 Fauci agreed to a glowing article sitting in front of his swimming pool for InStyle while millions of people are out of work due to policies he pushed- and is still pushing.

It would be better to learn from a few volunteers than to find out after giving the vaccine to thousands of volunteers as is now being done. The most important reason voluntary challenge testing is more ethical is that it will cut months off the development time when months equal thousands of lives lost and millions seriously ill with long term damage."

It is hard to not imagine Russian and Chinese war game strategists making germ warfare - virus warfare -  the number one tool in their arsenal to overpower our country at an opportune moment in the future, say, just before China invades Taiwan or Russia invades the eastern European EU countries.

2020-07-16 19:21:29,"What I found most sobering this week was a U.K. study that cast doubt on the potential of coronavirus vaccines to provide lasting immunity.  The study was published on July 11 on a preprint server (not yet peer-reviewed).   Antibody levels peaked 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms but then declined.   Levels declined to the point that re-infection was possible and concerning.  This aligns with what heatlhcare workers are seeing with re-infection.  This study result would effectively mitigate any hope of ""heard immunity"".  It would also mean that not only the presence of an antibody response would be required from a vaccine but one that is significantly more durable than the natural antibody response.   If this study is true, that is obviously not great news.  All the vaccine optimism has focused on production of an antibody response but not the durability.  Vaccination of the entire world's population is difficult enough but if we needed to repeat the process every few months, the world is facing an ongoing calamity."

2020-07-16 20:48:34,"When international cooperation is sabotaged, not the least by Trump and the US, the international race is open. There remain some cooperation through WTO ( European research still talk with China, Singapore too ), but the US has all about excluded yourself with your blame game and hunt for profits.

China is a giant in this field with more scientists than any other nation and an ability to fund multiple research efforts. If an effective vaccine is developed in China they can mass manufacture it too. 

It is very likely China is cutting some corners in the testing process, but if a Chinese vaccine should be vetted and internationally approved, they must follow procedure. They likely do that too in a parallel process. 

However, real life testing must take place outside China, as they have virtually no cases at home. But there's no shortage of badly hit nations on this planet to test. Will the US decline if China offers a safe, verified and cheap vaccine? Trump probably would, for him it's all about money.

With all it's draconian faults China did one thing right during the last 40 years, namely high quality mass education, creating a relatively well off and well educated 350-400 million strong middle class. It is likely the largest pool of advanced knowledge this world has ever seen. Most were educated in China but millions went to Western universities too. Even in Denmark we have Chinese students, mostly in the social and societal science.

It's definitely an unusual route China is taking but so unusualy is this pandemic as well. As long as people are aware of what they sign up for and they do it voluntarily, this is not a bad sign when people sign up for a vaccine shot.

Then when they become incapacitated up pops a sibling they haven't seen in years and don't want making decisions. If the ""decision maker"" is designated on a form not recognized by their state the state (and hence the hospitals/docs who have to follow the law) may hand decision making to the ""next of kin,"" i.e., that sibling or other relative.

He estimated that there were actually as many as 20 million cases in the US when the diagnosed cases reached one million.

Whatever signature the election board has on file, there is no way it matches how I sign my name today.  

So who are these experts that will be tasked with matching my signature?  How many years of training will they have in handwriting analysis?  Are there any legal requirements for a 'recent' signature, not the one I signed when I first registered when I was 18 or moved to my present location?

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms imposes a mask-wearing ordinance for her city so that residents and visitors may not spread a virus that continues to elude our attempts to control it. Then, along comes Brian Kemp, the Georgia governor, who sues Ms. Lance Bottoms (and other mayors of the state) to prevent them from enforcing these necessary safety precautions against its spread.

Is this the same governor who, just a few days ago, greeted the president of the United States on the tarmac while he (and many in his welcoming entourage) wore a mask? I must ask, ""Why did he wear a mask?"" He certainly knew of the president's aversion to face-coverings. Yet, as a fellow Republican, wearing a mask in the president's presence was not a slap in his face? Then why did the governor mask up? Was it a one-up?

Or is it that the various mayors in Georgia, thinking of the safety of their constituents and the visitors to those cities and towns, are black? Is the Georgia governor is attempting to use the courts to validate his title as the state's preeminent politician, to ""put down a rebellion"" by elected black leaders?

Is the Georgia governor, with this silly and dangerous lawsuit, really saying, ""Mine is the final word, and that's all Georgia needs?"" Does he not understand that if the courts side with him, that any and all resulting infections and deaths will be laid to his charge?

I think another reason is that hospitals cannot treat more patients because they are out of ICU beds. What's really hurting the healthcare workers? They have to see the patients die not because they can't but the ICUs are full. The problem let them feel guilty because they have to see those whole can survive under a normal circumstance die.

But here in Washington no spikes followed BLM protests in which most everyone wore masks; rather the increase in cases are linked with large private gatherings where people aren’t wearing masks, and east of the Cascades, Republican country where people take their cues from Trump masks are rare. Outbreaks are also linked to Trump rallies where almost no one wears masks. Fox News, Republicans’ most trusted news source, lies.

But on a more positive note, Arizona is finally seeing its numbers go down. Governor Ducey had outlawed mask orders but relented on June 14th because Arizona’s numbers were going through the roof . Three weeks after cities and towns issued masks orders the number of cases per day stopped rising, and now a month later they are actually going down, thankfully."

In Australia, it has worked (notwithstanding a second wave in some areas wherein restrictions were required to be re-implemented).

Our number of daily deaths is ten times that of countries with comparable economic/health care/COVID conditions (Europe, Canada, S Korea, Japan, Australia).  Although I have not seen data, I believe our economic position is no better either.  Our situation is not acceptable. 1,000 deaths a day is bad exchange for not wearing a mask, washing hands and social distancing.

I think the problem is many people (some of my peers even!), dont trust the source of the data within our country and certainly from other countries. We also dont see and experience the impact of the illness (deaths and ""recoveries"").  Attitudes towards drunk driving changed when mothers got public about deaths, people saw both memorials on the side of the road and permanent child disabilites .  Unfortunately COVID deaths have been concentrated among the population that many people dont want to see (elderly and brown people). It has to be clearer that COVID deaths are incremental and avoidable compared to other illnesses.

Our American freedom to consume may be altered (bars, salons, summer trips).  However, our freedom to fight has not been.  This is the new normal.  A viral invasion is serious and will return (what many East Asian countries already know). New habits and technologies will benefit future generations.

To think about all of the men and women who really have sacrificed their liberty and their lives, by fighting in wars that they agreed with or not, and all of these people with their false sense of patriotism screaming about being made to wear a mask... to think this is where our country is, it’s quite tragic."
2020-07-17 15:01:18,"The responsibility for the recent spike in COVID cases lies squarely with Donald J. Trump. In my opinion, he should be held liable for a lawsuit by the Americans for the COVID related deaths in the United States. It is due, in large part, to his dereliction of duty, resistance to health experts' advice, and turning a health issue into politics for his political gain that America is experiencing an enormous spike in COVID cases.

Trump's inadequate response to fighting the pandemic has brought the world's most powerful and advanced country down to the level of countries like Brazil, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi-Arabia, that are currently struggling with the virus. 

While the countries mentioned above lack expertise and resources to control the pandemic, America lacks effective leadership. With that in mind, Americans not only need to sue Donald Trump for the loss of countless lives, they must also deny him his much desired chance for the second term in office."

Watching the response in the US, where the Governor of Georgia is suing the Mayor of Atlanta over a mandate to wear a mask, wasting precious time and resources. 
 America has become a surreal tale from Bizarro Land, as the number of new daily cases of Covid-19 has exceeded 70,000 in the US, and in Georgia the hospitals are already swamped, already forced to practice a form of triage, and refrigerated trucks are standing by outside Atlanta hospitals to receive the overflow of corpses."

Americans are armed to the teeth. That is our real response to a virus. That is our response to everything. An assault rifle against a virus. The fear on my block is visceral. We are hunkered down.

My family, mostly boys, has a garden. The food from the garden has to last.

Were they to believe that one can give up something for the sake of someone else, or worse that our government has the right to ask that of them, then they might accept or be lead to feel that they should temper their desire to own guns.  

I would like to see the statistics.  It would be very surprising if all anti-maskers did not hold pro-gun rights beliefs."

Not only do they not care that they expose us all to their dewy droplets of spittle, they do so aggressively.  It’s like they want to fight.  They are actually like coiled snakes, just waiting to strike (no offense to snakes).  I had the unfortunate experience to be on the receiving end of such aggression at a recent outdoor event.  I was trying to help an employee at the event who was being hassled by someone who was refusing to wear a mask.  In the spirit of seeking to defuse the situation, I simply said kindly “Please cooperate.”  He proceeded to scream right in my face without a mask on.  His hot breath and spit was on my face.  All I could say is “Why are you doing this to me.  Please stop.”   He was removed from the event.  

All I have to say, is be so careful out there.  Everyone’s health is important.... even this jerk who spat in my face."

As our hospital staff and facilities get overwhelmed, the death rates will soar as well. People will die in their homes because emergency response personnel are answering other calls or lined up outside overcrowded emergency rooms. Ventilators will be the coin of the realm. People will die in cars and ambulances waiting to get into hospitals. People will die in the streets and parks. Inevitably, nursing home protocols will be breached, resulting in yet another wave of virus among our most vulnerable.

Tests results will be delayed for weeks rendering them useless because positive cases will be walking around in the general population all that time spreading the virus. Contact tracing will be useless because people won't recall who they contacted two or three weeks earlier.

This is our immediate future. This is who we are or soon will be."

So easy to congratulate the medical community for adapting and reducing fatalities in the face of increased cases. So easy to ask the media to help him spread the word about reasonable safe practices.  But his mental condition prevents him.
2020-07-17 13:02:27,"Record daily cases and still no one comments on the correlation to record daily protests. If you’re out doing something unnecessary (going to a bar or a dance party), you’re spreading Covid but out with a moral justification, then you get a pass. And before people start saying, protesters wear masks and they’re outside, let’s not forget all don’t wear masks and they are packed together for hours (Covid loves proximity, even outside). Then, they leave the protest and go who knows where. This is the two-week Covid bump. Is it a coincidence? Probably not. And no one is going to tell the protestors to stop for fear of backlash, so settle in because protesting in the streets during a Pandemic has ensured the protest at the polls isn’t going to happen. If you think the Trump game plan at this point isn’t to allow the numbers to go up because he can delay or cancel the election or just allow people to die who would have voted for Biden, you’re all kidding yourselves."

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

Please stop getting your news from conspiracy theorists and Russian hackers (a.k.a. Fox News). Please start understanding that COVID-19 has nothing to do with your political beliefs or philosophies.

If people could be trusted to do the right things, we wouldn’t be in this situation. And, people look to leaders for guidance if they don’t know what the right thing is - when they see him fighting local mask mandates, that signals that wearing a mask isn’t the right thing. 

He says businesses are suffering because of these local mandates, but businesses (and people!) are suffering because of the *virus*. One way to improve people’s outlook would be to take actions that would make them feel safer engaging in economic activity, like requiring masks! And investing in public health resources, which Kemp has failed to do as well. 

He has gone against expert recommendations and public opinion at every turn in this pandemic, and the people of Georgia are suffering the fallout. I don’t understand how he thinks his positions are good for his political career or the people of Georgia, and I don’t want to find out how bad it has to get for him to snap out if it, but here we are."

That argument does not hold. We have lots of laws on the books that could be construed as restricting personal liberties, such as laws against public nudity or urinating in public or speed limits on our roads. This whole resistance to wearing masks starts with our dear leader and his insistence at one time that the virus is a hoax and that he won't wear a mask. It is purely political at this point and really has little to do with personal freedoms.

Now that would be a real infringement on your freedoms. All you are being asked to do is wear a mask to protect yourselves, your loved ones, and your fellow countrymen – for a limited time only. This pandemic is not going to last forever. It will be consigned to the dustbin of history one day. Surely this isn’t too much to ask.

And the vast majority of people that I’ve met and spoken to (socially distanced, of course) have been doing the same. This is why our state has been able to tame the Coronavirus beast as well as we have. It doesn’t seem like a great imposition or a loss of self-determination on my part when I don the mask, but it does feel as though I’m protecting my neighbors as well as offering some slight protection to myself. Whenever I find myself questioning the wisdom of wearing the face mask, I just look to our president for his guidance and wisdom on the subject. He refuses to wear the mask and, since he is never right, I gladly wear the mask. I also refused to inject or swallow Lysol as he suggested, and I did not take Hydroxychloroquin since he touted it. As a result I, like my fellow New Yorkers, am enjoying the phased reopening of our economy, but conservatively.

But nationwide, the majority of us and our political leaders chose instant gratification over rational sense anyway. Now we see the fatal consequences of stupidity on a national scale.

Lack of leadership. Period.

Leaders in other nations are not all that brilliant, but they did not stoop to play silly childish or grifting games with the pandemic, lives of their citizens nor the economy. And they largely managed to assemble national consensus on an efficient response and mobilize all available resources. Most cooperated internationally too.

Not so in the US where Trump didn't care for anything but cheap soundbites and his daily ""ratings"". And even urged State governors and his devoted followers to ignore the threat.

Hubris. The US did not simply copy safe and reliable tests available via WHO. No, tests must be developed in America. 2 months wasted on that account.

More Hubris. The US look at East Asian methods, enabling their economy to stay almost open ( Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Singapore ). Did not copy European nations subsidizing wages and income for all ordinary citizens, to make the economy run idle, while we waited out the surge.  

In the US you did not protect jobs and income. Many millions became unemployed and many could not afford to shelter. Billions were funneled to some businesses while many others were neglected. Widespread fraud is now obvious.

This backlog simply represents a ""teething problem"" as the State discovers what the requirement are of such a system.  Far better to learn what needs to be done to streamline the reporting while running a primary than a general election.

The Governor and the State and City election officials should be applauded for quickly moving NYS's ballot system from the 18th to 21st Centuries.  Such a sea change requires adaptation and learning.

One general problem with opening up: if you go one step too far forward, you may have to go ten steps backward.

On a strictly jurisdictional basis -- this is undoubtedly legally correct.  States are sovereign entities recognized as such under the US Constitution.  Cities, counties, towns etc. are legally simply ""creations of each State"" and are always subject to State law and control.

So I get the legal argument going on.

But I truly question the logic and intelligence of Governor Kemp picking this fight at this time over the subject of mandating mask wearing.

Does the Governor's overruling of the City of Atlanta mean that there is no requirement to wear masks at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport?

Isn't that just about the largest ""connector"" airport in the US, if not the world?  And doesn't that mean that this airport could become a Covid spreader hot spot with thousands of unmasked people passing through it every day?  People who are traveling somewhere else thus potentially further spreading the virus?

What intelligent person who must travel would now want to start a flight or connect with one at this Airport?

I thought, no way, we can’t be that stupid to allow this level of sickness and death.  His prediction looks like it will be true, and yes we are that stupid.

Today I heard that other experts are predicting by the end of the year 1 million new cases every day and over 800,000 deaths.

My God, we are in deep trouble!  The soonest we can hope for a rescue plan is 1/20/21, another six months!  

Biden should start a group of experts now to scope and develop a rescue plan that can be implemented on his first day; we cannot afford as a nation to wait while he gathers his resources.

And all the,while, trump and school districts are planning to reopen schools that will inevitably lead to more sickness and death.

I have to deal with plenty of people who wrongly claim running and biking outdoors (especially away from others as I usually do) requires a mask, even though they are the same people who wrongly excuse the protests because ""everyone was wearing masks""--I was at several, that is not true, and most people I know were not.

Regardless that they lost their impeachment quest, too many American lives are at play, and though Trump is a President the Supreme Court noted his is no King and therefore is not beyond the law. Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and fellow Republicans must return from their self imposed vacation, where they are enjoying all the benefits still being paid by Taxpayers while not providing any service. It is time that Emergency Actions which would include the 25th amendment be taken before there is a greater tragedy than is presently occurring. At no time should government feel that an election is a top priority when they have taken an oath to protect the Nation and this certainly mandates immediate medical, financial, and scientific intervention. It is noted that should the proper Infection Control Measures be taken as has been done in every country that has followed the scientific path then there is a high chance to minimize the atrocities that are now at the highest height of this crisis. Trump is deficient in morality and duty."

So it will be interesting to look back and calibrate the George Floyd effect, and estimate how many people died because of thoughtless protesters.

Floyd died on May 25.

Protests started in earnest 3 days later.

New Covid-19 Cases in Minnseota bottomed on June 15th and have skyrocketed since then, peaking (so far) on July 11th.

This isn't a coincidence. The new case corelation with the protest gatherings is irrefultable. 

While vacationers from the northeast (see statements by Harvard researchers) have contributed greatly to outbreaks also correllable with summer activities by local young people, there is an additional set of spikes in Florida and Texas that tie well with the Floyd protests.

Ditto for other big cities that saw big protests.

I understand that ‘if it bleeds it leads’ and that the number of cases is bigger and more headline grabbing.  But if you can’t provide the data on deaths, and explain how the former translates (or is likely to) into the latter then you are doing the public a massive disservice and playing into the hands of the conspiracists, the Russian trolls, and the administration’s attempt to pervert the use of the data."

2020-07-18 00:37:03,"Georgia can recall Brian Kemp.

The Constitution of the State of Georgia authorizes the General Assembly to ""provide by general law for the recall of public officials who hold elective office."" This provision is found in Article II, Section II, Paragraph IV. Georgia law provides for the recall of ALL elected officials.

The relevant legislation requires at least one of the following grounds for calling a recall election:

-an act of malfeasance or misconduct while in office,
-violation of the oath of office,
-failure to perform duties prescribed by law
-willfully misusing, converting, or misappropriating, without authority, public property or public funds entrusted to or associated with the elective office to which the official has been elected or appointed.

The number of valid signatures required for a recall election is 15 percent of the number of persons that voted in the election.

In Georgia, 3.9 million people voted in the gubernatorial election. That’s 585,000 signatures. I bet Georgia could get that many signatures by this time next week.

There are numerous tracks operating all over North America( and other parts of the world) now with many different safety protocols ,particularly Re masking. Whether you think this is a good or bad idea or are not interested in the least is inconsequential.

But when I go out I know I will see between 30 and 50 percent of people not wearing masks.  I know that the newly opened bar near me will be packed with all those people who just cannot seem to simply stay at home and cook for themselves.   I know that many of the ubiquitous churches will have in person services (although to be fair, many are still online).  I also know that today the Governor made it almost impossible for school districts to do anything other than full in person attendance starting at the beginning of the school year.  So, clearly, Iowans cannot be counted on to do what is right and needed and attitudes like you find in my state are the reason we are where we are as a nation.

Georgia mandates that persons in a public place keep various parts of their concealed from view. So it has been for decades, no centuries. That is the law.

The coverup was done knowing it would cause needless deaths of innocent Americans.  The perpetrators are: Trump, his family, his cabinet, his advisors, Senate republicans, republicans governors, Republican state officials just name some of the principal perpetrators in this massive criminal coverup.  

We have witnessed their systematic crimes and the ongoing coverup carried out by this Whitehouse over many months now.   It started with dismantling the previous adm pandemic playbooks and pandemic preparation departments, then the daily WH briefings in which Trump and his cabinet knowingly lied and spread false virus information, then we learned Trump secretly ordered the coronavirus testing slowed down, then we learned Jared was in control of our national stockpiles of medical PPE equipment and was not reaching hospitals and states that desperately needed it,  daily we saw Trump announcing that the virus was a hoax or falsifying the true number of virus cases,  while his entire administration was giving out false medical and economic information while they were silencing real experts, and on and on, it goes and continues today.

But it is not a miracle cure and can only supplement hand hygiene, avoiding touching your face, social distancing etc. And it most certainly can't substitute all of us taking shelter the best we can, avoid crowding and take care of each other.

Masks can't substitute adequate help to all citizens to take shelter and wait out the virus. Mask can't make up for conning political grifters. The virus is absolutely indifferent to your political or religious affiliation, it will hit those exposed and unprotected, as some US states are learning very late in the process.

It doesn't matter what someone did yesterday, because you can't change it. Two or many more wrongs will never make one right. But what you do today and in the future, might help yourself and your fellow citizens, regardless of color age, wealth or whatever. 

Dr. Fauci is spot on, the US must restart your pandemic response and forget about your many deep rooted divisions, none of them will help any of you, your loved ones or your state, city, neighborhood.

This is a difficult thing for most people to do.  Of course, Trump will never admit he was wrong, but hopefully he will soon be irrelevant.  Other Republicans (governors, mayors, representatives and senators) need to bite the bullet and accept the consequences (political and otherwise) of their past mistakes.

I believe this will add weight to the second thing they must do: forcefully tell anyone who will listen to them that mask-wearing is essential to curbing this terrible pandemic.  They must renounce the culture war they have exacerbated and plead with their constituencies to follow the recommendations of the ""experts.""

Without an admission of guilt on the part of leaders, however difficult that may be, the culture war, the pandemic, economic catastrophe, and increasing social unrest will overwhelm all of us.

Humility is going to be essential for our civilization to survive this nightmare.  I wonder if any of these people are up to the challenge."

Our inept Governor refused to listen to scientists who begged him to follow CDC guidelines. Our inept Governor refused to wear a mask. Our inept Governor took the power of local Mayors to implement more stringent rules. Our inept Governor never set up increased testing capacity while people like may gave up our lives age livelihoods for months while sheltering.

now i see that those resistant to wearing them are using crocheted or mesh masks. it gives the appearance of wearing a mask but they are totally porous and provide no zero protection from beathing, coughing, or sneezing - the aerosol goes right through the material.

am i wrong, or is this just plain evil? if they wear no mask, you can distance yourself, but before you notice the material of these masks, it is too late and one could become exposed to the coronavirus. what sort of person acts in this deceitful manner?"

Or will they insist on being the first in line as “essential”?  “We will fight to the death to preserve our right to stay sick, and die, on our own terms!” This is a real litmus test for the people in this country. Smart, considerate and caring, or ignorant and self-centered? We’ve always had to carry the simple and the slow-witted, and they will always been with us. But the weight just got a lot heavier."

Start with senator Rand Paul."
2020-07-17 13:44:51,"As we now know that sars-cov-2 (COVID 19) is transmitted via aerosol (i.e., airborne transmission) mask use will definitely decrease transmission.  Therefore, if we are going to keep COVID 19 in check until there is a vaccine mask use should be mandatory.  It is absolutely necessary when indoors and it is preferable when outdoors, too.  The only exception should be in one's home or auto or when no one is nearby when outdoors.   Although we have frequently stated that 6 feet is an adequate distance we know that airborne transmission can extend beyond 6 feet. 
Many people wear their mask below their nose or below their chin.  This is the same as not wearing a mask.  If there is going to be a public ad campaign, it is incumbent upon Governor Cuomo and others to demonstrate proper mask usage.  Perhaps the NYT should devote a page to proper mask usage.  
Politicians through out the country need to do what is right for the public's health at this time and institute mask mandates regardless of what their constituents believe."
2020-07-17 13:24:12,"On one hand the politicization of mask wearing is bewildering. As scientists learn more about coronavirus, the simple fact that it's airborne means that any barrier that interferes with transmission will be effective. The proof is overwhelming - from the hairdressers in Missouri to the many regions in the world and even in the U.S. that have managed to slow down or even halt infections through the diligent use of masks. The fact that back in March we were advise to not wear masks, both because there wasn't enough known yet about the virus and due to the sad reality of not having enough protective gear for vital works, should by now be completely irrelevant. However, the reaction of so many people is not as bewildering when considering the Republican dismissal of science and facts, modeled by our so called leader. How many people will have to die before Trump and his followers realize that they are wrong?"
2020-07-17 13:32:57,"So, should people be allowed to drink and drive because not driving is an infringement on their right to drive? Or, should people with STD be allowed to hide their condition and spend a very intimate evening with their partner with no protection?

It is not about people's right to not wear masks but about them not having the right to transmit their condition to others."
2020-07-17 13:41:28,"To wear, or not to wear, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous virus,
Or to take arms against the sea of COVID
And by opposing end them. 

We see in America the fallacy of individual liberty. Individual liberty is valued so highly that people are willing to put others at risk of death in order to maintain their own individual liberty. 

We are a small, and selfish people."
2020-07-17 13:39:57,"I don't get it.  This resistance to wearing masks is not only ignorance personified but also like partaking in Russian Roulette.  I was a hospital nurse for years, and we all learned quickly the value of wearing a mask, and it was not only in the OR or ER.  It was in every department where it was often necessary to protect our patients as well as ourselves.  I can barely comprehend why this has become so politicized.  But then I look to the White House and those folks at large - both politicians and Trump supporters - who have lost the ability to reason and decipher the difference between life and death.  Think of the how the spread of Covid-19 could have been assuaged, how too many deaths could have been prevented if we had a ""president"" who heeded the advice of experts in the field of infectious diseases.  Responsibility and accountability clearly falls upon Trump's shoulders.  But it also falls upon ours.  Both he and America have failed miserably."

2020-07-17 13:47:29,"The grotesque insanity of our present pandemic moment can be encapsulated by the contrived resistance to perhaps the single most effective means of crushing the virus in its tracks. Six months into the worst health crisis of our times, and barely half our states have mask mandates. Meanwhile, Kevan Smith, a baseball catcher who is cheered for wearing a mask for a living, is jeered and shunned for wearing one in public in order to protect family, friends, and strangers. As a California health official has said, not wearing a face-covering during this national emergency is akin to spitting in your neighbor’s face. People willingly accept mandates on everything from seat belts and smoking in restaurants to taxes and speed limits, yet feign indignation and outrage when asked to do something with even more life-saving potential. Sadly, when our nation has a shameless fool posing as its leader, some, I suppose, will follow what passes for his lead and behave, well, shamelessly."
2020-07-17 13:48:49,"Do these governors and protestors understand that the purpose of masks is to protect OTHER people in their vicinity not themselves. This will prevent spread of the virus.

2020-07-17 13:55:11,"Infringing on personal liberty.  These people who claim their right not to wear a mask, more often than not, are the same people waving their tacky Trump flags and boasting their patriotism; their love of country and willingness to sacrifice for it.  Is wearing a simple mask too much of a sacrifice for their country?  What about personal responsibility to protect and support their neighbors and fellow Americans?  This is a war and these people are laying down their weapons.   They call themselves Patriots, I think not."
2020-07-17 13:55:48,"We can no longer pretend that anti-science idiocy is an equally valid viewpoint worthy of respect.  This affects all our health and safety, and even the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs both came out today saying that requiring masks would help the economy recover quicker.

2020-07-17 13:49:27,It just blows my mind that people are still resisting wearing a mask while being inside a public venue. Why is it so difficult to wear a mask for a short time while you are in the supermarket? It protects you and me. If everyone wore a mask in public we could slow the spread. Put on the mask and stop debating it.  There is no confusion about the guidance now.  I’ve been telling everyone to wear a mask since the beginning of March because anybody with any logic would have realized back then that the virus is airborne. I’m not a scientist just a logical person.
2020-07-17 13:50:15,"Americans crave freedom. That is a good thing in general. But the ethos that ""Govt is the problem"" - spouted by Reagan on down, can prove deadly. So when government introduces regulations aimed to save lives by the millions - seat belts, motorcycle helmets, gun control, and masks in a viral pandemic - fighting regulation for the sake of ""freedom"" is not only deeply flawed, but lethal. This mistaken ethos in part explains America's gun culture, and its worst case response to this pandemic."

Really, I owe my freedoms to the Republican party and that fool Stitt?

Perhaps you should invite him to elaborate on precisely what freedom is abrogated by the effort to save innocent lives from the know-nothing selfishness of Republicans everywhere.

This is the opposite of how America works, the death of our core principles and foundational beliefs.

These boneheads are twisting their panties in knots trying manufacture division, hatred, controversy where there is none.  And you have been supporting this ridiculous movement in spades for months now.

At the same time these doughty patriots pull the classic Scalia Deception, eliminating individual and community rights in the name of big government.

2020-07-17 14:01:48,The fact that we are still fighting the battle to get people to mask is why we are now a third world country.  Pretty soon polio will re-emerge and other diseases long since resolved. American exceptionalism is now American ignorance.
2020-07-17 14:07:38,"Says the Governor of Oklahoma: “You can’t pick and choose what freedoms you are going to give people[.]""

In fact, that is exactly what has happened in every society in the history of this planet, including our own constitutional democracy.  Moreover, Gov. Stitt took an oath to see that the laws of his state are faithfully executed, and those laws--like the similar laws enacted in every state in the union--impose numerous restrictions on human behavior:

You are *not* free to kill out of vengeance or hatred; you *are* free to defend yourself. 

You are *not* free to seize another's property; you *are* free to sell your own.

You are *not* free to have sex with a minor; you *are* free to have sex with anyone who is old enough to consent (and does so). 

Perhaps the most striking change in this country resulting from Trump's presidency is the increasingly blatant, unabashed embrace of 'might makes right' as the chief philosophical tenet of American Conservative thought.  

Of course, wealth has almost invariably translated into might in this country, and the marriage of wealth and power are historically omnipresent in the rise of a police state.  What is remarkable in the  obstinance of 'mask protestors' is that they lend legitimacy to a regime that actively erodes their standard of living, and as regards Covid-19, has convinced them to boisterously endanger their own lives."
2020-07-17 14:05:46,"States infringe on your right to be naked outside your home and there are no rallys to say the state has no legal right to demand clothes. 
This is a health emergency with responsibility given to governors by all state constitutions. When state legislatures convene they too can make enforceable laws, but until then executive orders prevail every bit as much as a hurricane hitting your state. 
Demanding you wear a mask in public is no less lawful than the state demanding you wear clothes."

Do the rights of those who refuse to wear masks more important than those who have to work?
Why should doctors and nurses risk their lives for people who won't wear masks, and the families they infect?  Do medical personnel have the right to refuse to treat those who refuse masks?
When mask refusers infect friends, relatives, or strangers who die of coronavirus, they should feel  guilty. 'Oh I was wrong, why are people so mean to me' doesn't cut it."
2020-07-17 14:18:13,"This idea that by requiring individuals to wear a mask in order to promote public safety is an infringement on individual freedoms is ludicrous at best.

I hope my fellow Americans will accept how important it is to wear a mask at this time.  Baring this, we'll likely become an even more divided country with areas of mask wearing and others that allow people to go mask free.

Just as Reprehensible is that the no-mandate stems directly from the Republican Party's traditional call for the rights of citizens to make individual choices (i.e., ""less government"").

Shame on these Republicans, who fail to understand (or care) that a core value of federal centralized government is to Protect its citizens from wars and other threats, like pandemics.

It's utterly narrow-minded, indeed, Childish, that -- 5 months into a killer pandemic -- many [so-called] Republican leaders still don't get that the primary ways to reduce new Covid-19 cases is to (1) mandate mask-wearing in all public places, and (2) require this mandate NATIONWIDE.

Protests against mask mandates in areas where the virus is spiking? A bit too much like protesting a firefighter's union while your house is burning down. A governor suing a mayor over her attempt to issue a mask requirement? Guess this guy honestly does not have anywhere better to direct his authority at the moment. Another gov splitting hairs about ""what freedoms to give people"" even as he's tested positive himself?

The old aphorism that most of us create most of our own problems most of the time is a useful one to keep in mind as a general guiding principle of life. I guess it's time for a corollary: Don't assume that we're smart enough not to make our problems worse.

But let's be honest -- this isn't about freedom.  This is about some bizarre obstinacy many Americans have about being subservient to science and nature.   The people who won't wear masks are the same ones who won't concede that climate change exists, even as they wade in 3 feet of flood waters. 

I engage with people in Euope, Asia and the middle east regularly, as part of my job.  I'm told America is ridiculed as a laughing stock.  Sometimes we are pitied.

Consider the messenger when it comes to mask wearing.  The United States is acting irrational, at least some of it.

But it's deeper than simple irrationality.  It's a lack of collective spirit that other countries take for granted, rallying together for the common good.

Somewhere in the past four decades that collective sense of responsibility has gone missing. Brian Kemp's directive against masks is akin to banning flu shots.  Does he have a death wish?

This is a pandemic, for God's sake, and proclaiming the freedom to infect others, with the high mortality rate of Covid-19, should be considered criminal.  What else can you call running around maskless and infecting others?"

Yes, they are a pain to wear, but there are many different types some more comfortable than others, but the main purpose is to protect others. Even if you feel immune to the virus you can still spread it to others that may not be so immune. There should be a national law to require masks, but Trump has made it a political statement and painted himself into a corner. It’s obvious to anyone that can think for themselves that Trump is more concerned with winning reelection no matter what the cost to others is. Once this pandemic is over and hopefully Trump is voted out in November he and all the governors that have been instrumental in enabling this pandemic to grow be held criminally negligent for the excessive deaths of American citizens."

The advice we have all officially received about protecting our population has shifted on a number of occasions and even now for many it is not seen clearly or beyond dispute. However, the country is almost universally accepting of the premise that science and reason are the best basis for policy and that social responsibility is not optional.
It has been a very difficult time for people of faith, especially those for whom assembly is an important part of their witness. But reason has  again prevailed.
Nobody here believes out political leaders are above reason and consequently they do not, on the whole, say or do things that can be refuted by simple evidence or focus. Opinion is opinion but science is accepted as true on evidential grounds and/or until proven untrue.
Not wearing masks is a political statement with serious consequences for everyone in the context of saving lives and controlling disease. Why mask wearing has become politicised is down to Trump making it so and is yet another example of his ability to take people with him down his yellow brick road.

And yet, we have all agreed that smoking in public places may be restricted, that we cannot drink and drive, and that we must wear seat belts - for the benefit of all!

Of course, he has kids now, so I imagine he takes a different view. I read an article about a mask protester who said she wanted people to respect her right to not wear a mask. I thought, okay, I do respect your right not to wear a mask—just not inside around other people. Another good analogy for me is smoking—you have the right to smoke all you want, but not around me because it’s bad for my health and you don’t have the right to endanger my health.

Dear misguided Kemp and Bundy. Nobody has a right to endanger others. People can be spreading a potentially deadly virus without knowing it, by breathing near others. Masks have been shown to reduce the risk of infecting others.

You already have the freedom to not wear a mask, when you are home, or are alone. You are not putting others at risk by your choice.

Once you decide that entering the presence of others with face open to the air is more important than the potential harm your action presents to those innocent others, you have crossed a line.

They'd hammer on the door if they could see even a sliver of light coming from inside homes. There were no streetlights, no cars, no shops or restaurants open after dark. The threat, of course, was the German Luftwaffe. It would conduct nighttime flyovers scanning for English cities and towns to destroy.

Nobody railed against this ordinance, this need to behave in a way that was a matter of survival, a matter of protecting themselves against a genuine and imminent threat. There were no fights about loss of liberty or infringement on people's freedoms. Wearing a mask is like pulling blackout curtains across the window. It's about survival, of protecting each other against an imminent and deadly threat. Pull together, America. You can do it."

And the second person is our Surgeon General Jerome Adams who went on Fox TV and on Twitter imploring people to not buy or wear masks. Here are his wise words on ""Fox & Friends"" March 31: “What the World Health Organization [WHO] and the CDC [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear masks.”

He then explained the reasons why.

“On an individual level, there was a study in 2015 looking at medical students and medical students wearing surgical masks touch their face on average 23 times,” Adams explained. “We know a major way that you can get respiratory diseases like coronavirus is by touching a surface and then touching your face so wearing a mask improperly can actually increase your risk of getting disease.”"

I am having a hard time understanding why so many Americans believe wearing a mask is infringing on our ‘freedom’ and ‘rights’.  Call me judgmental, but these groups of ‘anti-mask’ protesters and residents are your basic entitled, selfish Americans.  I love what Mr. Cuomo said about wearing masks and 100% agree with that statement.  We have become so divided in this country, not only in the last four years under the Trump Administration, but also during this pandemic.  The Coronavirus is no longer a health crisis –it truly has become politicized and that’s just unacceptable and shameful.  Even if our leaders can not set good examples or implement mandatory mask wearing in their states and cities, we as individuals need to collectively do our part in lowering the number of cases and deaths by wearing a mask.  Get over yourself, put your pride and shock value protest signs away and just wear a mask.  Let’s not make this Black Plague II and have this continue for the next 5 years.

Returning the favor of goodwill to these workers should surmount the specious argument of infringement of one’s freedom, a construct of the ignorant and selfish.

The child’s safety depends upon proper restraint inside the vehicle. Ditto for driver and other passengers.

There was resistance to wearing seatbelts in cars in the Fifties, Sixties, and even Seventies. Some people believed it was safer to be thrown from a vehicle than to remain belted inside. I placed lap belts in a ’51 Chevy Belair that I bought as a teenager and, later in another Chevy when my wife and I moved to a college town. I survived a serious accident in the second Chevy because I was belted in when a motorcyclist illegally crossed my path and struck my car.

Some people appear to have no concept of how microbes disperse when one breathes or receives the breath of others in close quarters. It is as if people never had a course in health and hygiene or learned about the germ theory. Would they also not wash their hands after using the toilet or wear seat belts when driving?

All of this is hypothetical and supports thinking that cloth masks will deliver us from evil.

On top of the surging covid cases, at a time when T has issued an immigration ban and in his mind boggling stupidity doesn’t use the advice of experts, critically needed immigrant doctors are being barred from entering the US  even though they have been hired hospitals now facing a shortage of COVID doctors.

The problem is in that boondoggle organization known as Homeland Security.  Homeland Security was set up by Bush to give money and contracts to his donors under the pretense of protecting the country.  

One of their jobs is to approve visas and they are rejecting doctors’ visas.  

Republicans took over the federal government for one purpose only: to raid the coffers and make a small group of people very rich. They do not care about people.

 The president doesn’t want people to know that he’s caused a pandemic to get out of control. Meanwhile other countries have it under control. So he looks bad.

But going to my doctor's office, a place where sick people go, I wondered if my mask was good enough. Most of the air I breathe goes in and out past my nose, obviously unfiltered.

So when I saw my doctor I asked him WHERE I could get a better mask since I'd already decided that my mask wasn't good enough. He looked at me and said that my mask was good enough. I knew why he said that.  I asked in response, ""Because my mask is not there to protect me; it's there to protect others, right?""  ""Yup,"" he replied.

RE: But there is staunch resistance from those who see mask mandates as an attack on personal liberty.

If I were in a crowd and started throwing rocks in random directions I would be arrested for Reckless Endangerment, perhaps Assault With A Deadly Weapon, or possibly even Murder.  My personal liberty does not allow me to choose to start throwing rocks around.  Why should my personal liberty allow me to choose to endanger those around me with a virus, sicken some of them, and possibly kill others?

It's time some laws were laid down to punish those cretins who endanger others nearby by CHOOSING to not wear a mask. A crowded jail cell would be a good place to let them think about their choice.

I believe there are people who wish to remain ignorant and to feel put out because they think 'we' (those of us who wear masks and want them to as well) are bullying them. They think their rights are being violated.  It makes me laugh (sort of).

There should be some mention of the difficulty in acquiring appropriate PPE for a company in the food chain (FSMA 17) as well as how to institute best practices for social distancing. Adequate PPE costs at a minimum five times what it did in February but is largely unavailable to the general industrial marketplace at any price. These costs that most likely were previously a general item (like toilet paper of pencils in the budget) are now significant. As is the lost productivity from process changes that distancing/best practices would impose. The above two points directly relate to the tougher issue that should be keeping Mr. Tulkoff awake at night, the health and safety of his employees and customers, NOT IDLE EQUIPMENT.

Landlords took the 600 a week (amazing transfer of wealth)- and they probably accepted interest free loans on top. The cherry on top is congress said the relief was to the 31st but actually it only is to the 25th which skimps that last 600 bucks. 


It’s a shame this country’s leaders feel as though the American people have become complacent and lazy. 
Especially when the Senate are all millionaires. Our leaders should really address the issue that working 40 hours a week doesn’t pay the bills. 600 a week. Big bucks!

It is beyond insult to imply that anyone needs to educate the educators of the compelling effectiveness of in school learning versus remote home environment. 

I dare any one of these groups recently releasing a report to direct us to a real world school district that should be opening up and create an extremely specific video of how their schools can easily and inexpensively retool their buildings so they can be reopened safely in 2 weeks or less.

Spending money visibly on education signals clearly to children that they matter to their parents and their community. So does involving them in other future-oriented activities, from sorting the recylcling to attending a demonstration. 

In these days of creeping fascism and climate denial, a strong sense of the future and its better possibilities are essential to children’s mental health. Essential, in fact, to everyone’s mental health, especially the adults upon whom the burden of responsibility must ultimately fall.

So, there’s an inservice day where he/she/they give us the latest revelation guaranteed to burnish our clearly sub-standard instruction. Then after the rapt (polite) attention and a round of teacher applause, it was back to the classroom, shut the door, and teach.

The evidence is that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than the typical cold virus (a coronavirus of a different type).  I am not getting warm fuzzy feelings from these people with an agenda to open schools hoping for this American re-opening won't add to the dead pile like the current re-opening is doing in Tx, Az, Fl. 

This is not to say that in person school is unimportant in our society.  It is.  I want schools in session, but safely-- I am not seeing that 1 or 2 quarters of optional remote learning is such a disaster versus the risk. 

Finally, I am tired of people who can afford broadband and choose not to do so, forcing the results of their choice on the rest of us.  Sure, many poor have to live in disadvantaged areas, but a surprising number of folks choose not to have infrastructure.   They are (or were) happy with their limited smartphone connectivity and refuse to upgrade their infrastructure, or move if that isn't possible.

I understand that smaller children and kids with special needs are at the top of the list when it comes to getting kids back into a school setting. I know I struggled with online school earlier this year so I cannot even begin to imagine what it is like for less fortunate students. But there is still the pandemic going around so even if we are able to go back to school it would definitely be different. There would obviously be distance between students and masks would be recommended if not required in classrooms.Which would be an adjustment but if students are so eager to get back into a classroom with their peers it shouldn't be an issue. But again, there are many things schools would have to work through to get back to a semi normal school year this September. And although I would love to see my friends again, I have the  understanding that there are certain steps are certain groups of people that need the school setting more and I am thankful for an education at all because some don't even have that available."

2020-07-21 17:31:01,"As long as medically fragile teachers and those over say, age 60, are exempted from live teaching, I think school can safely be resumed in some fashion.

Life never has zero risks. Ever. Every single year many thousands die of flu and meningitis. Every single year, people die in currents or of vibrio on beaches. Big states have many thousands of deaths due to traffic accidents alone.

There is not guarantee of a vaccine with a 100 percent efficacy rate, or when we get it.  But we need society to open back up, or we are going to sink into a world wide depression and there are huge risks in assuming kids can keep on staying at home without end in sight.  I am tired of people saying the government should spend more money. Hey, that is more taxes folks, or less of your pension.

Moreover, the quality thus far of online teaching has been abysmal. Our district had NO live teaching at all. Just some stupid templates on line requiring our elementary kids to jump from one website to the next, filling out Adobe forms that didn't work. 

I have yet to run into a single teacher who seems to want to go back. But the death rate for those under 60 without comorbid conditions is incredibly small; the media has over sensationalized or been irresponsible in many instances to convince people otherwise.

When I hear teachers saying online is so great, I think that is misguided. If everyone finds out their children learn just as much with Kahn Academy, many local teaching jobs will be over."
2020-07-21 18:13:30,"If we could find a way to integrate our info technology resources with our community teachers that include those who have changed careers and or have been laid off, we might be able to forge a model of smaller pods of students within communities, the one room schoolhouse model, that are remotely connected but personally monitored during the day.   

By having smaller pods, they are exposed to fewer people/germs and it is far easier to isolate a small group vs an entire school community.  

There may be people who would open their homes or expand their community daycares/church & community programs to look after these kids so that their parents can work, the kids can learn and have time away from the screen as well.  Even I would be willing to do this for a year.

We’ve largely created this whole mess by continually underfunding education and underpaying teachers. Hopefully from this we learn from this. Only smart and significant investment in public education will reduce educational inequalities.

The arbitrary standards and goals adults with no education experience decided they needed to know? We have over-tested elementary children and given them countless age-INappropriate lessons to the point that many of them are anxious and can’t think for themselves. Honestly, some time out of this toxic environment might be good for them. Maybe empathy and creativity (oh, you know, just those things everyone complains kids don’t have these days) will make a comeback. Elementary children learn best through play and exploration. I see nothing worse than forcing them into one room for the day, unable to move around, unable to see each others’ faces just to prepare for another test that the powers that be want them to take. Education is about SO MUCH MORE."

2020-07-21 19:46:21,"Unlike with walking or speaking, there is no biological or neurological window within which reading, history, math, etc. must be learned. The only two reasons adults have more trouble learning these things as quickly are that they have been told and therefore believe it's supposed to be difficult, and they don't have as much time to devote to learning as kids do.  Remote learning is also not the only way to learn.  You do not have to watch videos and complete online forms to learn.  Parents need to make an effort here to learn more about homeschooling and all the possible ways to do that instead of continuing to sign off their responsibilities for their children's learning to strangers across town or across the county.  Failing that, get used to the idea that your kiddo will have a pause in their education, and that's okay because they can also learn what they missed later.  The virus doesn't care how you feel about this and your decisions in this area could almost literally leave blood on your hands."
2020-07-21 19:53:07,"Yes making a distinction between younger and older children seems to follow the science as we understand it right now.  

But I noticed another problem muddying the analysis: 

“Reopening schools should be a priority because schools fulfill many roles beyond providing an education, the authors said. “It’s child care, it’s nutrition, it’s health services, it’s social and emotional support services,” said Dr. Enriqueta Bond, the committee’s chair.”

No one can talk about schools as schools, they inevitably talk about schools as anything-but-schools.  Our schools were a mess even before COVID because we can’t focus on what it is we actually want them to accomplish.  

Forcing families to send their kids to school during a pandemic so they can receive “health services” is ludicrous, as everyone is unquestionably healthier when they avoid exposure to COVID.  In a rational society, there would be other ways to get food and health services to kids that didn’t involve exposing them, their families and their teachers to a deadly disease."
2020-07-21 18:21:22,"There is a better way to do remote learning if we have to. I recommended to our principal and never heard back. 30 minute classes with 30 minute breaks, so they can decompress. Have the schedule be the normal schedule they would have had in an in person environment. Let lunch be an open zoom meeting so kids can just talk.

I have a friend that is part of the teachers union and he told me off the record that the union decided to teach so little earlier this year. They told the teachers it was up to them how much they would do extra on top of morning meeting.

2020-07-21 20:43:23,"The author cites the disparities between middle class and low income students, but that will be exacerbated even more by the return to school.  Many parents in our district are opting to keep their children home,  providing  socialization through a carefully selected bubble of one or two other families.  The remote learners will have parental supervision and help and plenty of extracurricular activities.  The students from low socioeconomic backgrounds will be off at school where the risk of exposure to the virus is much higher and when they bring the virus home it is to families with much higher risk of dying.  Sure, send the kids back to school, but a lot of parents will provide a safer home alternative and it will pretty much follow income lines."

Remote ""learning"" for younger students, as well as for students receiving special education services, is decidedly no substitute for in-person instruction. It may in fact be little better than nothing at all for these children and their families. Potentially, it's worse than nothing.

Risk is a constant. Covid-19, while magnifying risk, is by no means the end-all of hazards that have long threatened school communities. The point is to manage it, intelligently, drawing from a broad range of expertise from both inside and outside of the schools, finally allocating sufficient resources, and adapting. I fear that much of the reticence to resume school is a flare-up of a worsening American habit since 9/11: staying home because it's just not safe to go out."
2020-07-21 23:28:29,"I'm in Wake County NC, an important swing county in tight swing state. At this point, restaurants are open, golf courses, hair salons, malls, and pools, as well as private schools. But the school board, with over 150,000 children, chose remote learning for all ages. Now well-off parents are bidding for the services of teachers to teach pods of kids while they work. Current teachers, who will be teaching full time remotely and pulling a full salary, are publicly offering to tutor groups of students for private pay simultaneously, essentially double dipping while claiming they are too afraid to teach in class. The board ignored parent input and  questions, shows no concern for working parents, and ignored the welfare of young and disabled children. Because of budget cuts, there are no funds to help with child care or instruction for poor and working class two earner families. Next year their kids will come in almost two years behind, and well-off kids will be further ahead with private tutors creating a learning gap of 3 years plus between the haves and have nots. Parents I know are scrambling, desperate, and seeking private options. Many refuse to have their children go back to unstable public schools and they are starting to talk about how to recoup their tax dollars to pay for the unexpected costs. If the schools had opened just for K-3/4, who need the most supervision, they could have avoided this fiasco. It seems the school system is helping defund itself at this point."
2020-07-22 00:03:54,"The doctors, scientists and experts are fairly unanimous here:  elementary school should re-open.

So the next thing we need to worry about is maximizing the safety of teachers in the classroom.

That's the bottom line."
2020-07-22 00:20:13,"There is a compromise solution that will address the issue, and that is to open Elementary schools, keep social distance in and out of the classroom, teachers wear masks, teachers teach 10-12 students which means more teachers are hired or reassigned to maintain the proper ratio, outdoor classes where possible, maintaining the proper sized custodial staff to sanitize the classrooms and school campus per CDC recommendations and whatever else the CDC recommends. If the current administration is serious about school reopening, they'll back stop the additional cost of implementing these steps."
2020-07-21 20:05:36,"""Wading into the contentious debate over reopening schools, an influential committee of scientists and educators on Wednesday recommended that, wherever possible, younger children and those with special needs should attend school in person.""

You can help us navigate and endure the chaos storm that’s coming in a few weeks. (Be sure to bring your wallet—we spend insane amounts of our own money doing this gig.) And when one of the teachers or secretaries or cafeteria workers or bus drivers or custodians dies, you be sure to show up at the funeral and defend your ideologies to the grieving family. Then you can return to school and explain it to the kids—who will be in shock. Until you’re willing to walk the walk, you have no right to talk the talk."

I hope my tax dollars didn't pay for this report.   Worthless."

2020-07-21 21:19:01,"This article ignores the fact that many young children are being raised in the home of their grandparents, even great aunts. The data from around the world say that the COVID virus is many, many more times lethal to this age group than it is to adults in the age cohort of those parents of school age children.

Just where in this study was there consideration taken for the lives, let alone health, of people in their 70's taking care of school age children? Cute little vectors can very well end up killing their grandparents. The 2000 census states that 2.4 million children are in the care of their grandparents. More recent figures suggest that by 2010 the 2000 figure had risen to one in seven school age children are in a grandparent headed home.

This same danger presents to professionals in the schools, such as experienced teachers, support staff, school nurses, custodians and administrative staff.

<a href=""https://www.prb.org/us-children-grandparents"" target=""_blank"">https://www.prb.org/us-children-grandparents</a>/

As a grandparent caring for an eight year old, forgive me if part of me sees this policy as one of baldly justifying the killing of grandparents for education of the children in their care."
2020-07-22 00:03:12,It is immoral to require children and teachers to go to in-person school prior to a vaccine.  Period.
2020-07-21 23:50:00,"The authors of this report are sorely out of touch with how a public elementary school works!! My fiance is a 5th grade teacher and I am absolutely terrified for her health for when the schools reopen.

Her whole teaching methodology is built around interaction and collaboration. Not to mention the  behavioral issues she deals with for most of her working day. 
Getting kids to stay in their seats becomes harder as the kids are younger. How is anyone going to be able to enforce that? 
There are multiple reports from a lot of scientists now that say that coronavirus droplets can hang in the air and hence the ventilation system needs retrofitting that can push new air in regularly which is not done in the current system. As the article notes, the money to do these changes is not something school districts can afford!! They can't even afford basic supplies like pens, pencils and notebooks. My fiance buys all of that and so much more out of her own pocket.
And regular symptom checks? They have a single nurse who is perpetually busy. Who's going to be responsible for that?
All of the recommendations in this paper come with a big asterisk on the side that needs huge financial intervention from the state and the feds. Yet there's not a single state or agency that is infusing new money for this at anywhere near required levels. Meanwhile, headline grabbing conclusions like this paint selfless educators as greedy and lazy. Spend a single day in an educator's shoes and you'll know."
2020-07-22 01:35:06,"The panel's recommendations will serve, in future years, as example of extreme, fatal myopia that prolonged a pandemic.

Of course sending the kids to school, and people to work, are good things. Unless the alternative is either dying, or being permanently scarred with medical problems.

Framework for opening?  These folks have either imbibed Kool Aid, or are bought and paid for.  I doubt both."
2020-07-22 01:49:50,"The ""experts"" can make a lot of untested assumptions right now.  They are, in fact, advocating for placing children in schools as a part of a large scale scientific experiment to see what will happen with young children and Covid-19 in a group setting...because these experts don't know. All of the independent variables notwithstanding, the outcome of this experiment is not predictable.  It is unethical to use the youngest of children as guinea pigs in a test case experiment when the end result could be death.  

Each time I read or hear about parents lamenting  the loss of in-person school, the usual suspects appear. 

1.  Remote Learning didn't work for my child - Well when districts turn on a dime to shift to Remote Learning with no training for teachers, of course it will be less than ideal.  Some parents complained that teachers treated Remote Learning with too much rigor - as though in person school was still in session.  Others complained that teachers treated Remote Learning as though students were also dealing with the trauma of the sudden onset of a Pandemic and should have delivered instruction with no consideration for this historic health crisis.

The scientific community is not weighing the ethics of the large scale scientific experiment that it desires.  The elementary school children who have parents that are eager to push them out of the house will be the subjects and other children will be the control group.  What a clever way to gather data without an IRB."
2020-07-22 02:02:12,"With all due respect to the scientific experts, they are simply unaware of how schools operate.   Open schools and kids will die.   I do want to be proven wrong on that point.   Schools are simply not set up to accommodate what they are suggesting."
2020-07-21 20:21:56,"They recommend that we ""minimize group activities SUCH AS LUNCH.""

""Sit there and eat in silence, kids""--will that really be better for their mental health? 

How about:
""Sorry you killed grandma, kiddo. But you're on track in algebra!""

The USA had a chance to make this school year happen in person. But we lacked the self-control to avoid bars and the political will to shut churches. 

Let's be honest that we blew it, and prepare for online classes. Then get ready for the corona 2.0/seasonal flu cocktail that's headed our way in 3 months."
2020-07-21 22:40:02,"I agree all children are better off in school, but why then is home schooling allowed?"
2020-07-21 21:49:44,"Looks like opinions are all over the place.  We have to keep in mind that if we are not sensible, we will have lots of well-educated corpses.  Get real, folks.  This is a deadly opponent, not just another ""problem"" to be solved."
2020-07-21 21:55:17,"Pure nonsense!

Guidance changes almost daily.

Are there really parents willing to make their kids the guinea pigs in uncharted territory that has little to no preventative support from the government other than the false concept that the virus will go away?

Young kids, though rare, have already been infected, some have died and some have had other covid-related complications. 

The impending second wave?

""Educational risks"" are a scare tactic designed to appeal to those parents not disciplined enough to find a way to care for and educate their own kids; unlike generations of yore.

The trump administration wants popular support for this measure as it is deemed the core to getting the economy back to where it once was. There is no concern on their for the fallout once this experiment fails as the administration has relinquished all fault for itself and businesses that crave your in-person loyalty.

Everyone is on their own.

Good luck with that one."
2020-07-21 20:53:27,"Scientists urge reopening eh? I guess they eliminated irrelevant factors to narrow the problem down to its nub. Obscuring details like spreading a very contagious sometimes fatal disease, and having a President who interrupts funding of preventive measures."

2020-07-22 02:40:54,"young children are certainly ill suited to online learning but they are well suited to real world learning. if we paid parents enough to stay home and engage with their younger children they could unplug. they could bake, fold laundry, and use life as the curriculum as generations of parents have before.  these activities generate the actual lessons younger kids need: cooperation, community care, independence, cause and effect, etc."
2020-07-22 04:03:36,"Schools should reopen in most of the US in the fall. In my county 7 people have gotten Covid so far, none have been hospitalized, and none have died. My county has 4,500 people and the school should definitely open. In rural areas Covid is not a huge problem because everyone already is socially distanced all the time. Rural and Tribal Land holds kids with no access to the net. My internet is so slow you could never do real schoolwork, and we have been trying for over a decade to get someone to install fiber optic but it never seems to happen. Send the kids to school. If you are in a city maybe school shouldn't be opened, but in almost all of rural America and tribal America schools should open."
2020-07-22 04:06:51,"-So, why do essential workers not include teachers? Grocery clerks have been working from day one. Delivery truck drivers, the list goes on. We have thank you signs for health care workers (deservingly so). Why can’t we have the same argument for teachers? These threads are always the same. I rarely see comments suggesting ideas on how to make it work. It’s always easy to say how it won’t."
2020-07-22 02:37:40,"By necessity our national focus has to be to a full bore, no holes barred effort to stop the virus. It is obvious that opening schools would be ideal but it is utterly unrealistic at this time. Closing schools or online education are emergency efforts and very very far from ideal. If opening schools and restarting the economy is truly important we would quit fretting about ridiculous opinions on opening schools and insist that a national government effort be put in place to make COVID-19 so small it could be drowned in a bath tub."
2020-07-22 02:52:27,"“One of the shocks to me is that over 50 percent of the school buildings are awful,” Dr. Bond said.

Really? If you cared to know at all you wouldn’t be surprised. Kids get lead exposure from water fountains and paint chips at schools. There is so much talk about how important schools are. Like many things labeled, important, this one too is just a talking point."
2020-07-22 02:20:43,"...also calling for surgical masks to be worn by all teachers and staff members during school hours, and for cloth face coverings to be worn by all students, including those in elementary school. Hahahaha - good luck with that. Some parents will refuse and that will be the end of any ""requirements"". Just look at the protest over masks in Provo a week or so ago. I have to wonder if they have any clue of how delicate the control of a school is with respect to parents, school boards, and anything remotely unpopular. 

Regular symptom checks should be conducted, the committee said, and not just temperature checks. Yep, we're right on top of the testing thingy. There is zero effective testing, tracing, and isolation. None at all. 
 The most critical question though:""...the committee did not address the level of community transmission at which opening schools might become unsafe simply because too much virus may be circulating. “They punted the most critical question,”"

May those who spread it to the infant learn from their mistakes and not give it to mom and infant again.

Everyone must do everything in their power to reduce the spread of this virus. Masks, social distancing, staying home. No exceptions, no excuses. 

We also need to increase pressure on our elected officials to rectify the continued inadequacies in testing (both for antibodies and current infections) and PPE, not only for healthcare professionals but everyone. It’s shocking that 7.5 months into this pandemic, the US remains deficient in this regard."

My anger is growing every day at the willful spread of ignorance by the Trump administration through the under cutting of science. And the lack of will to contain this virus. Even here in a state where the amount of infections has dramatically decreased— a “success.”  There should be no thought of success until the infection rate is to zero.
“Almost normal”.  These are devastating words to any parent.  
Almost normal is not good enough.  What is wrong with this country?  Why is there no will to truly contain this virus?"

They took me away from her right away, so she knew that something was wrong. I was almost a SIDS baby twice. Luckily my Dad knew CPR from the Army, one time performing it on the hood of his Chevy. I’m happy to say that I had no long term effects. I’m praying today’s babies have the same luck. Although my mom and I made it through that pandemic, mom didn’t survive this one. She died from Covid-19 that she caught at her assisted living facility, where she was living with advanced stage dementia. I’ll never forget her telling me how she screamed at the hospital to see her baby after they took me away. She was an amazing mom.

The fringe propaganda has become so effective, in large part thanks to Zuckerberg, that it forces serious debate between these two options when really, there shouldn’t even be any question over the ethical and most beneficial choice.

I’m a staunch progressive and I’ve even found myself at times wondering if there’s a chance the terrible option is not so bad as I repeatedly slam my head into the metaphorical debate wall defending what confusingly should be the clear option.

When the powers that be barrel forward regardless of how loud the voice of reason screams, there’s a moment of anticipation when the gaslighting is the strongest and before consequences have materialized, when the propaganda machine claims defeat.

The aforementioned strange part for me is how oddly comforting it is when the consequences do inevitably arrive and all the things you were warning about in vain come rushing in just as predicted. I guess it’s the relief you weren’t crazy and there is still such a thing as science and experts. It’s a short lived comfort though, sitting in a pile of wreckage we knew was coming, and could have prevented."

Our gutting of PE classes, something I had daily as a child, as well forcing children to rack up lunch debt already proves this.

He then reluctantly closed down the national economy--like a child told to eat his broccoli--and then, in a fit of impatient rage, exhorted ""my people"" to ""liberate"" their states from the tyrannical Democrats. He was going to have his ""re-opening,"" our national well-being be hanged.

Now schools, bowing to the pressure of anxious parents, have said they won't re-open next month. Some businesses, too, aren't opening up, fearful of the frightening multiplier of infections now running at will through states that the president needs in November.

He's come from ""15 cases going down to zero"" to ""it will be gone by Easter"" to ""I don't take responsibility at all"" to ""too much testing"" to ""we'll have to live with the virus."" With such determined ignorance and impatience and cowardice in the face of an enemy that isn't taking a whole lot of prisoners, the president now looks like a cat chasing its tail. He'll never catch it.

2020-07-15 12:24:07,"""Most U.S. School Districts Aren’t Ready to Reopen""

This is the first and only accurate NYT article on the state of school openings. It's been dismaying to listen to the NYT promote the deadly dangerous idea that schools can open in weeks.

Two items are on the list to reopen: 1) parents need childcare to work (they do) and 2) teaching in person is vastly better than virtual learning (it is). Against those two compelling motivations is a list a mile long about why we cannot even consider it. Here are a few.

1. This is a deadly pandemic. Repeat that until it gets through. In a deadly pandemic, the only blunt instrument we have is social distancing. It's literally, demonstrably impossible to safely distance in crowded classrooms.

2. Our schools are falling apart on a good day. Many of the ideas proffered on these pages over the past weeks have great merit; we do need smaller classes, better air circulation, more teachers, better hygiene protocols. We also need billions of dollars and years to implement those ideas. 

3. No states are mandating that children wear masks. If the teacher alone wears a mask, it doesn't work. Period.

4. Parents appear to have glossed over entirely the risk to teachers and themselves. If they think parenting and helping to teach from home are hard now, how do they manage from a hospital bed? Have they even thought about the danger to every adult?

Teachers *want* to return to school. Our country has made it impossible to safely do so right now."
2020-07-15 11:20:13,"Donald Trump and republicans aren’t trying to lead, govern or even control the pandemic.  After failing to stand up testing, refusing to support production of  PPE, they are now putting all their efforts into controlling the numbers so we will not know how many are sick or how many have died- which will lead to happy talk and more death as people will falsely be lead to believe that everything is ok.

Everyday since graduating from nursing school I’ve been proud of my profession, of serving the public in so many ways, and proud of every other healthcare provider.  They have worked under some of the worst of times.  They have given their lives. They have sacrificed. 

Now, for healthcare providers, nation wide, who work every single day, caring for people, attempting to save lives - but risking their own lives - there will be no public access to reliable real data from the CDC?  

This is a slap in the face to us healthcare staff, an insult.  Healthcare workers are required to give their lives, sacrifice the safety of their loved ones from contagion, watch patients struggle for lives - but not see numbers and data of COVID from a reliable source, the CDC?  That is the very cause they face every single minute of their work. 

Now that data is going to be private Trump held information?  To serve him, to be used and abused at the Trump discretion?

And yet until just the past few days the president’s unwillingness to model wearing a mask or social distancing as the key to getting past this terrible crisis and reopening our economy while following the rules of data and science.

“We fully support the Paris Agreement’s goal to keep the rise in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius (2°C) above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. In pursuit of this goal, we also support the vision of a transition towards a net-zero emissions energy system.  (We)  agree with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C special report, which states that in order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world economy would need to transform in a number of complex and connected ways. Meeting this challenge would require an even more rapid escalation in the scale and pace of change in the coming decades than was foreseen in the Paris Agreement.”

The problem is that we don’t know enough about how Covid-19 effects ANY demographic. Is it a respiratory or a vascular disease? Does it cause brain damage, etc? Certainly death or some chronic condition associated with Covid-19 will adversely effect a child’s “future”? Growing up without a parent or having a teacher die from the virus seems deleterious to a child’s development, no?

There is simply not enough information about the disease to open schools. There isn’t enough PPE for teachers, staff or students. There are parents that gleefully refuse to wear masks..."

COVID in itself is a hazard and a challenge; Trump turned it into a disaster. He is now doubling down on failure by pursuing any magical theory in his mind. I see no other alternative than things getting very, very bad in the fall and winter. Let's not forget that even if Trump loses in November the transfer of power won't happen until February 2021 and any policies won't have effect before late spring into early summer of 2021.

The federal minimum wage is $7.25.  Many full-time minimum wage jobs require the worker to be there for 40 hours per week, but dock them for lunch break, and pay them for only 37.5 hours.  Thus, a minimum wage job pays only $271.87 per week.  This is barely above the poverty level for a single person, which is $255.20 per week.

Many states have a minimum wage set above federal level.  Let's put the ""average"" at $11 per hour.  Even at $100/hour, the worker earns just $412 per week, which is substantially lower than $600, and it's also below the poverty line for a family of 4, which is $503/week.

Even against the outrage of stingy Republicans, some states set a minimum wage of $15 per hour.  Even at $15/hour, a full-time job at 37.5 hours/week pays only $562.  Thus, for a single-earner family (i.e. one spouse stays home to do childcare), a full-time job brings in just $59 per week more than the poverty line, whereas the unemployment benefit by itself brings in $98/week.

So, the true disincentive about returning to work is that in our country, a job that pays minimum wage doesn't pay a salary that's reasonable to live on!"

Instead, conservatives, left to their own devices, left the virus to its, and, through, chaos, incoherence and their endless loop of stupidity and ignorance, allowed a once manageable problem to careen out of control. Ironically, they now push for schools to dangerously open prematurely, as they either ignore the science, truth and facts taught therein or criticize their curriculum as “liberal indoctrination”.

Then his handlers claimed he was just kidding, then Trump said he doesn't kid. (He lies a lot though) 

So now he orders hospital data to no longer be sent to the CDC, rather routed to an inherently political office under his sway. Let's see if we can put two and two together and get the drift of his intention. Count less, claim there is less, actually creating more, eventually lots more cases. Data?

Schools are controlled locally, not nationally. States can impose their own travel/quarantine requirements.

No matter how school districts will choose--home teaching on the internet or kids going to school--there will be chaos, dumbing down this generation. Going to school will mean that kids, even if asymptomatic, will bring home from crowded settings the virus to their families, including elder or immune-compromised family members. Teachers will get infected, some will be hospitalized, disabled, or will die. Absenteeism will increase. Some teachers will refuse to go to campus.

On the other hand, home teaching (as for example at Los Angeles) does not assure high quality. Some families will lack the internet or adequate computers, unless the schools will provide them at no cost. Parents will give up their jobs to stay home to supervise them, and thus lose income and paying the rent, or kids will be left unsupervised, endangering them. No more science projects, theater, driving ed, art, shop classes. We will lose our competitive edge on the global stage.

This could have been avoided. But Republicans keep their heads in the sand, and now a new generation will be denied essential skills."

Be ready when people come back out slowly!

Just copy the best practices of other countries. They are humans doing well, we can be too. 

They have the advantage of better leadership perhaps, a sense that they can do it patriotically together for the common good.

The decline in vaccination rates is linked to our reactions to the pandemic. The shutdowns have made things like vaccinations more difficult to administer. This is a huge deal and, as the article states, could cause more damage than covid. 

Sadly, it was Trump who, in his awful and ineffective way, warned that the cure could be worse than the disease. He was a terrible messenger but the idea was important and largely ignored. We were told that the tradeoff was between our safety and the economy. It was something like, 'you are a bad person if you value corporate profits over health.' This was a fallacy.

We should also realize that some of the cultural values that make the Unitied States different from EU at times hurt us.  The EU has internal borders which the countries do close from time time--the US does not.  The EU has 27 presidents/prime ministers who have near full control of their state's policies and can shut them down, while the US has governors but they have much less power than EU country presidents.  The EU citizens are much more used to having their government ""take care of them"" so they will put up with lock-downs.  The EU citizens are not armed to their teeth with guns like the US citizens, so they can impose a lock down for longer.

While I would very much like to blame Donald Trump for every  problem in the United States, we have to recognize that his very election was the result of our culture.  Our culture empowers individualism, which can be very beneficial, but in some circumstances, it also leads to ignorance, violence and extreme wealth inequality.  Culture takes time to change, but it is constantly evolving, and the longer term indicators are that it is evolving towards a less violent, more accepting culture, even though we may feel that right now it is not."

Meanwhile, many other countries are gradually returning to normal due to their technology, organization, and effective leadership. The United States remains dead last in progress but number one in deaths but our past performance says it doesn't have to be this way. America has a 300 pound obstacle blocking the road to progress at every turn. If congress would do its job and impeach this man, over and over again, for each of the many crimes he's committed and his repeated failures, America could dig itself out of the bottomless pit known as Trump's World.

She later modified it to a recommendation that the National Guard assist the hospitals.

Per HHS spokesperson, CDC will have access to the reported covid 19 data but cannot not control it.

Per Rep de Lauro said HHS has become a political arm of the White House. This and the two sentences above are from WAPO 7/14/20.

The covid 19 data on US cases, deaths, testing, medical supplies come from 25,000+ hospitals; they previously sent the data to CDC for processing into useable national data. CDC made it available to all; research institutions, medical facilities, universities, district public health departments and the media, all depended on CDC information. Although the CDC is currently in disarray, there is not another organization, and certainly not HHS that can duplicate CDC's resources organizing such huge data banks.

I'm going to download the current stats on covid 19 from the Johns Hopkins web site (better set up than CDC's) and keep it for future reference to see what changes with HHS now controlling our health information.

This is obviously a gambit to fool the people into believing Trump and his cronies are actually doing something and to try to get re-elected. Of course they won't actually do anything at all.

You tell a child they can have one marshmallow now or two in 15 minutes. Then you leave the child alone with the marshmallow.

The ones who can discipline themselves to wait the 15 minutes and get two have better outlook in life in terms of education, job, etc. Further tests showed that economic status also plays a role as in, the poorer the home the child comes from, the less chance they can delay gratification for the 15 minutes to get twice as many marshmallows.

So, America, the parts that couldn’t stay locked down have brought on the win for the coronavirus but instead of economic status being the influencer, it appears the determining factor is politics.

What does that tell you about Republicans?"

Therein lies the problem. If the governors who refused to act appropriately and safely, experienced the horror that the rest of us go thru, we might have adequate testing and re-opening policies that didn't result in a second wave.

But we don't have such leadership. The nation is lead by a president who is, clearly, way in over his head, and his criminal sycophants in the senate and various governor positions have failed to act appropriately. 

Fortunately, individual corporations care about profits and they are instituting policies so the public is willing to shop at their stores.

2020-07-15 18:43:36,"Re: Navarro and Trump hiring ""only the best"" people.  From Wikipedia:

In six of his books about China, Navarro quotes a ""Ron Vara"", whom he describes as a China hawk and former Harvard PhD doctoral student in economics, and who says Sinophobic things about China and the Chinese. An investigation by the Chronicle of Higher Education found that no such person existed, and that Ron Vara (an anagram of Navarro) appeared to represent views that Navarro himself held.[106][107] Navarro has admitted to making up the character, an author surrogate, and quoting him in his books. Economist Glenn Hubbard, who co-authored Seeds of Destruction with Navarro,[108] has said he was not aware that Vara was fictional, and that he did not approve of Navarro attributing information to a fictional source.[109] In December 2019, a memo apparently authored by Ron Vara began circulating in Washington DC. The memo highlighted the ""Keep Tariff Argument"" and the use of tariffs against China a few days before an additional 15% tariff on $160 billion of Chinese made goods was set to be implemented. Navarro later confirmed that he had written the memo.[110]

2020-07-15 18:27:55,"“Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.” - Peter Navarro, Trump Senior Advisor.

Two months ago, Dr. Fauci testified before members of the Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee and warned that if there was a rush to reopen without following guidelines, his concern was “we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks. The consequences could be really serious” and in fact, opening too soon “could turn the clock back,” and that not only would cause “some suffering and death that could be avoided, but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery.” 

In the meantime, the virus is more out of control in July than it was in March, April or May.

Yeah, Dr. Fauci sure had it wrong . . .

Instead of focusing on this virus, Trump and gang continue to point fingers and play the blame game.

In the meantime, more people are getting sicker every day and more deaths are occurring.

Trump and his administration are actively undercutting the CDC, both in terms of these personal attacks on scientists and public health experts, as well as by removing the CDC from the loop of data - which goes to the heart of the core missions of the CDC and the service it provides the public and the public health administrators in the country.

Make no mistake, Trump is personally part of this attack - he is just pushing the ""but I like him personally"" line as an effort - and a lie - to have a modicum of political cover from those who are not amused.  In truth, he is shoring up his propaganda efforts to his anti-science base, and further consolidating his power by freezing out any voice seen as in opposition to any message (however moronic the message may be) that Trump puts out there."

2020-07-15 19:00:19,"How very odd and peculiar for Trump and the White House to attempt to ""distance itself from an attack on Dr. Anthony S. Fauci"" when it was they who initiated these personal and vicious attacks only days ago.

How very comforting to know that Trump and his administration have to much extra time on their hands that their focus is on destroying and discrediting the top infectious disease expert in the country instead of focusing on how to best control and minimize this virus.

Once again, the mindset and focus of Trump is NOT on helping Americans but in hurting those around him who tell the truth.  I'm surprised he hasn't spoken that infamous phrase of his - ""Dr. Fauci? I barely know the guy."""
2020-07-15 18:54:18,"When trump's caddy has a position in trump's mis-administation and that caddy has the nerve to criticize Dr. Fauci, we have indeed reached the bottom.

A lot more dead Americans, but hey, re-election and $ are the prime movers here, not epidemiologists and their cautions."
2020-07-15 19:07:50,"Dr. Fauci once again has the right diagnosis for the Trump administration in 'Let's stop this nonsense.' The sad truth is that the entire Trump approach to combating the Covid-19 virus epidemic has been complete non-sense. Instead of more testing, Trump calls for schools to reopen. Instead of more protective equipment, he tries to remove information from the C.D.C. and the public on the number of new Covid-19 virus cases and deaths. Instead of mandating the wearing of masks, he allows inept governors like Republican Kevin Stitt in Oklahoma to refuse to wear one or mandate them even though Stitt himself has just contracted the virus after foolishly allowing Trump to hold an indoor rally in Tulsa. Instead of promoting social distancing, Trump holds rallies and plans to hold his convention in Florida where another Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has so mishandled the virus that it's literally completely out of control. This is the real, sad, malignant nonsense that has made the United States the very worst major industrialized nation in dealing with the virus. It makes no sense because those in charge have no sense, and Americans are dying because of it."
2020-07-15 19:08:23,"Dr. Fauci said: ""Stop the nonsense"". 63% of America agrees with Dr. Fauci, but unfortunately, the rest watch FOX News and have no idea how poorly Trump has performed. 

Arizona has fewer than 200 ICU beds for the entire state but when some of the sick come into our hospital, they claim they had no idea the problem was so pervasive. The situation is dire in AZ. My nurses reuse masks for several days, masks which should be discarded after each patient. AZ Gov Ducey has failed miserably to make sure we have adequate test kits and PPE. AZ Senator McSally praises Trump whereas she should be calling for his impeachment. 

The disease seems to enlighten the oblivious people after COVID attacks a member of their family which means another third of America needs to contract COVID before election day."

Note that they will be doing this in school buildings with poor ventilation.  Then these individuals can go into the community and into their own homes to spread the virus germs further.  Re-opening schools can only be done safely, when virus cases in the community have decreased to manageable levels.  That is not the case in at least 39 of the 50 states."
2020-07-15 19:10:21,"This is the single biggest problem we face right now. If a member of your cabinet or staff is actively undermining our efforts to solve this: fire them. I thought you were good at that? 

We are paying the price for a total lack of leadership. Everyone wants the economy to reopen. Everyone wants to get back to normal. But you do it by tackling the underlying problem head on, not pretending it’s not there and threatening people to get back to business. 

The comparison to any other developed country shows just how extreme the failure is. 

In November we need to make a change. We can’t do this nonsense any more."
2020-07-15 18:49:01,"It's likely that Trump not only knew Navarro wrote the op-ed criticizing Dr.Fauci, but that he ordered it so that he could distance himself from such egregious attacks on someone who's much more popular than he is.

2020-07-15 19:07:17,Does Mr. Stitt realize that he has likely infected several people due to not wearing a mask indoors and there is a reasonable change that tracers will show one of them died?  Is this manslaughter when one knowingly disregards such measures based on the advice of medical experts?  Reckless endangerment?
2020-07-15 19:01:29,"Peter Navarro might consider his own economic statements and his particular out of the mainstream views.  Dr Fauci has enjoyed the trust of 5 presidents and is a highly respected public health authority worldwide. Mr. Navarro certainly isn't qualified to critique Dr Fauci, nor is the White House with their back stabbing talking points take  entirely out of context. Trump may not like what Fauci says, but he and his enablers might consider the real life consequences when they have not followed his advice.  How many lives will be lost as a result of the ""never maskers"" and the ""open for business"" crowds instance on their personal right to put others at risk?"
2020-07-15 19:21:33,"With all due respect Dr. Fauci did give conflicting advises throughout the process, especially in the initial phase of the pandemic. The press used those statements to show how Trump was contradicting Dr. Fauci. Press is equally responsible for creating confusion about the pandemic both as a result of their rush to publish stories about various studies ( many of them were contradicted by other studies) without verification and their agenda for the upcoming election. As a result, public is fed up and have stopped complying with even the basic guidelines like wearing masks. Go out in any Democratic state and the way people are behaving is not much different from any republican state. Democrats talk a lot but do nothing to change the ground realities in their own states. But they get a free pass from the so called unbiased reputed media outlets who themselves are stifling free speech by creating hostile environment for those with different viewpoints."

2020-07-15 19:30:38,"Trump is such a typical coward.  He rails about Dr. Fauci, retweeting nasty comments, and then send Peter Navarro to send up a trial balloon to see how much further he can go.

When that balloon gets shot down, Trump immediately claims it wasn't HIS balloon.  Does anyone actually believe that in this leak-paranoid administration, one of Trump's top advisors went and wrote an op-ed in USA Today without anyone at the White House knowing?  Sorry, folks -  this Wizard of Oz's curtain is very transparent."
2020-07-15 19:32:55,"Is anyone analyzing the possibility that the Trump administration's attacks on Dr. Fauci is motivated by a desire for the virus to remain active into November to allow it to disrupt the national election? This seems the only logical alternative to thinking that Trump's motivation is economic recovery.  He might believe economic recovery could help his campaign, but throwing the election into chaos more directly plays into his ability to remain in office, and for Republicans to remain in control of the senate. It fits with the overall active strategy of wanting to decrease voter turnout.
     Somehow the amount of deception the administration is throwing out about the pandemic does not add up if the argument is purely economic."

2020-07-15 19:23:27,"When it comes to handing the global pandemic, apparently the buck stops with Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino because Mr. Trump doesn't even pretend the buck stops with him. His only apparent mantra is, “Every problem in the world is their fault, not mine. I am a victim here.” More than ever, we see how true the aphorism is that great leaders rise and emerge with the times as the only thing that's risen today in the White House is a flaccid, damaged ego. After 244 years, America should take a mulligan on this president, let's forget the last four years of executive branch history. Let's try again in November."
2020-07-15 19:26:37,How can the nonsense be stopped when Donald Trump believes that cutting back on testing is a means to stop the coronavirus?  In fact he only wants to cut the reports of infections so that it looks like he has succeeded.  It must be remembered that the only person that matters to Donald Trump is Donald Trump.  The rest of us can get sick and die as long as Donald Trump gets reelected.

If Trump's definition of being ""on the same team"" is allowing public ridicule to the nation's top infectious disease expert, is it any wonder why this country does not have a handle on this virus?

Trump certainly has an odd way of demonstrating the concept of being ""on the same team.""

Any attempt to silence this man is akin to trying to turn off ""Old Faithful""- Dr. Fauci's facts continue to flow freely.  The truth refuses to bend or hide."
2020-07-15 19:15:25,I figured the op-ed was punishment from the White House since Navarro was the one to raise concerns when Trump was ignoring the virus.  Making Navarro  write a scathing opinion was the only way he could redeem himself to Trump.
2020-07-15 19:16:38,Navarro and Scavino must think that because they’re appointees of a pathological liar that they can say whatever they want regardless of facts or even decency and never mind re-election. Each in his own peculiar way has cast himself irrevocably in the same spineless form as the millions of medieval minions who have made this nation the embarrassment that it is today.

This is absurd and insanity. Things must change."

It’s obvious to anyone paying attention that this administration doesn’t care about people’s lives; the virus just gets in their way of making themselves look good. They want the economy to re-surge and you’re not their cheerleader. 
Look around. From an orchestrated attempt to make you look insignificant, to demanding that schools reopen, to spreading false “facts” about how the U. S. leads in masking and testing and to belittling governors and others who refuse to reopen their states economies, it’s all about trying to force people’s opinions that Covid-19 is yesterday’s news."

The horrible irony is that now there are so very few countries that admit Americans.
2020-07-15 19:13:30,"Finally, with the pandemic I would have thought that Congressional Republicans would have realized that they had sold their souls and their Party to the Devil.

Yet we hear sounds of silence from Republicans. Examples of the latest from Trump, tearing down Dr. Fauci, sequestering virus data, accusing Obama and Biden of stopping virus testing, ripping LA and San Diego for keeping schools closed until they have a safety plan.

Is any of that productive for our democracy? NO! Yet from Republicans we hear silence except for defense of Donald Trump.

Republicans converted themselves to the Party of Trump and the old party has been scrapped."

It is telling that we may look back on Walmart's decision as an inflection point -- an inflection that should have been reached months ago except we have a demented toddler for a president, and he decided to turn masks into (his words) something ""politically correct.""

This is on his hands. He built this, he energized it, he liked it, he retweeted it, he demanded it as a sign of loyalty. 

I have the perfect sign Walmart can use outside their stores: ""Don't be like Donnie! Wear a mask!""

Yes, we have sunk to the Goofus vs Gallant level of moral common sense. Sad, but let's get to it. Time's a-wasting."
2020-07-15 19:16:32,"This is Trump orchestrated soft denial.  He does this all the time and his base knows what he really thinks.  That’s the point.

2020-07-15 19:21:20,"""“The Peter Navarro op-ed didn’t go through normal White House clearance processes and is the opinion of Peter alone,” Alyssa Farah, the White House director for strategic communications, wrote on Twitter.""""

If Fauci had published without White House clearance, he would have been ousted in the blink of an eye.

It's clear that this is part of Trump's usual stirring of the chaos pot -- this time with the goal of getting Fauci to resign.

Fauci should not resign.  He should speak out even more forcefully and risk getting fired.  It's a win-win situation for him.  If he doesn't get fired, he gets his message across and undercuts Trump.  If he gets fired, given his enormous popularity, it only serves to weaken Trump even more.  

I just hope Fauci does this in October -- Fauci's October Surprise for Trump."
2020-07-15 19:22:17,Once again any person of personal or educational quality who comes in contact with Trump is show the door by this president.

I can't imagine being outside in such heat, wearing so many things that don't allow for a person's body to evaporate sweat and dispel body heat.  It must be awful for so many of them."

He's a leading economist like Gwyneth Paltrow is a leading  health expert. We are living the consequences of bad search engine optimization. 

I hesitate to call trade policy his ""lane,"" but at least when he stayed in it there was a title explaining why he inflicted his nonsense on the rest of us. Why are we interested in his opinion about public health?"

Just like those showing up at State Capitals demanding to liberate their States, dragging their kids, unmasked and with guns, this could be another repeat.  I find that pretty scary.  This already happened back in May, Calvin Munerlyn, a security guard in Michigan, shot and killed, all because he asked a customer to put on a mask.

It isn't shocking to read of the sudden verbal attacks on Dr. Fauci who also happens to be the nation's top infectious disease expert."

This time in his service to our country has to be incredibly frustrating.  How he is able to maintain such grace when confronting an ignorant president who deems himself a ruler, is unconditionally inspiring.

Keep it up Dr. WE need you. Thank you."
2020-07-15 19:38:35,"Dr. Fauci, I respect the fact that your goal is to protect the public health. That has never been the goal of the trump administration. Trump's goal is purely to get re-elected and play to his base as he has no concerns about anyone's health other than his own.

  And on another matter you mean to tell us that Walmart the nations largest retailer has NOT been enforcing a mask policy? I wonder how many infections and deaths have been a result of this blatant corporate malfeasance."
2020-07-15 19:43:26,"Unfortunately your idea of “stopping the virus” is not a reality. We can just mitigate the devastating effects. And we must do so without destroying the economy, so we do have to balance a variety of objectives, not just the virus which can’t be “stopped” anyway."
2020-07-15 19:35:22,"This administration has had problems with data since the inauguration. Remember the big rumpus that Trump raised (through his press secretary  Sean Spicer) about the crowds at the inauguration? From that moment, we should have known there would continue to be disputes over all kinds of figures. So that now, three and a half years into Trump's reign, we are all numbed by his daily skepticism about real numbers versus fake numbers. 

He has led us here on purpose. Causing confusion about facts is straight from the fascist-wannabe rule book. The progression toward the White House management of Covid-19 data is only natural. Now with all the facts under his control, Trump will be able to tell us whatever he wants us to believe. Is it also gas-lighting? Yeah, that, too. 

Oddly enough, he has not conditioned some of us to believe anything he says. I'm hoping we're a majority.

2020-07-15 19:37:55,"Fauci, Cuomo, and de Blasio all made mistakes. Then, after realizing their mistakes, they corrected them.

Trump made a series of fatal decisions, which I won't call mistakes. Then, after health experts pointed out their likely deadly consequences, decided not to correct them. Five months later (!), he's still on the same course-- going 100 miles an hour down the freeway in the wrong direction.

That, right there, is one of the main differences between people who are responsible, caring adults and someone who's neither responsible nor caring. (Nor an adult, emotionally.)"
2020-07-15 20:02:03,I suggest that data compiled by health care providers be made available to both the CDC and Homeland Security. At least then we'll be able to compare values. Future decisions will depend on the veracity of on-going recorded results. Starting over is not an option.
2020-07-15 20:01:06,Looks like Trump kept his promise of making America number one again. Just not in the way he promised in 2016.
2020-07-15 20:03:27,"While I commiserate with Dr. Fauci, his chances of getting Trump et. al. to ""stop the nonsense"" and focus on dealing responsibly with the pandemic are nil.

What we have been witnessing is literally a government under the control of unruly children.  From Trump on down we have seen nothing in the way of adult responsibility.  If the situation weren't so dire it would almost be amusing.  Kind of like some Hollywood fantasy where the adults live in a world run by four-year olds.

Much as all this nonsense should stop -- we all know that it won't.  From the Twitter-in-Chief on down to incompetents like Navarro et. al. we are living in the nightmare they are dreaming.

What does this imply? How will this information change how both researchers and physicians might treat this infection. I find it extremely troubling that American scientists in their mistaken attempts to shield the public from panic, fan the wide spread of untrue rumors.

Donald Trump has become the iceberg we need to steer past.

In a situation like this,  whether fighting a viral epidemic or flying into the unknowns of outer space, one needs a calm, collected and informed captain of the ship.  We need that demeanor currently and in the years to come to keep our Ship of State from becoming impaired on the rocks.  Dr. Fauci resembles  Bob Ebeling, the cautionary engineer on the Challenger Mission.  Others failed to heed his advice and we all  know the unfortunate result."

It was a great disappointment to do so; but sometimes wisdom simply has to triumph over pleasure-seeking.  When the tour operator offered to refund our deposit -- we jumped on it without hesitation.

In a society facing a raging pandemic, but where many people are consequently acting more like petulant children than responsible adults, it is not surprising that there is even a debate over whether or not to close the Parks.

Of course we should.

But since some insist that the Parks remain open, the only alternative is for intelligent people to refuse to visit.  Let the hoteliers see vacant rooms and the restaurant concessionaires see empty tables.  And if thousands or even millions still insist on visiting -- let them share the risks that wiser folk know not to take."

This is all so transparently juvenile but not unexpected for daycare Donnie.

Only congress should be able to change these things and the news reports should be more focused on where oh where has our congress gone, oh where oh where could it be.

Perhaps if the democrats were inclined to do something other than promote and approve Liz Cheney’s vision of military spending and Exxon’s vision of military protection for its new pipelines in the Mediterranean, they would have time to care about these things.  Perhaps someone (the press included) should encourage them to care.  Pelosi thinks the best plan is to let trump self-destruct, but pelosi may well be on her way out of there also when November rolls around. The house has enormous power and it pretends to be helpless. 

NY Times helped elect Trump with all its free media that fired up his campaign.  It’s time to take responsibility for that and to focus on the AWOL congress instead of every stupid move he makes.  At least supplement the article with something that shows (at least the theoretical) relevance of congress or we might as well just shut it down along with everything else."

It is greatly disturbing to consider the long term human and economic impact.  My greatest fear is a pandemic out of control, tired and ill health care workers and simply no ability to assist or control the virus with a collapsing economy and the horrors that will bring. 

We are looking deeply into a mirror that has allowed social and racial injustice for the length of our tenure as a nation and politicians that promote anti-science policies at the expense of the future and have done their best to sideline climate solutions.  Please see the UNEP report released this week, Preventing the next pandemic - Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission. <a href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/preventing-future-zoonotic-disease-outbreaks-protecting-environment-animals-and"" target=""_blank"">https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/preventing-future-zoonotic-disease-outbreaks-protecting-environment-animals-and</a>

In addition to the prevarications, his usual incoherent ramblings have reached the point of gibberish.  Jared found Peter Navarro when he was attempting to educate himself on China and was browsing Amazon, as any senior White House Advisor would do.  With the vast resources and expertise available in the State Department and other agencies, wouldn’t you choose Amazon as a starting point?   Navarro invented an expert Ron Vara, an anagram of his own name, to populate his books.  Recall that Jared promised that by July, the country would be rocking again.  I guess that’s one way to describe the current state of affairs in the country.

One the other hand, we have Tony Fauci, who has served six presidents, from both parties.  He is a preeminent scientist and a consummate public health expert.  He has a decades long track record of achievement and decency.  His efforts to find common ground with the AIDS activists were important and together, Fauci and activists changed the way patient advocacy drives scientific and regulatory achievement.  Fauci has weathered attacks before.  Larry Kramer accused him of being a murderer and an incompetent idiot, but the two went on to develop a decades long friendship because Fauci recognized the value of the input.  I suspect he’ll forego the friendship but stay for the science."

He thought he could bully the virus, and then brag to the American people and get re-elected in a landslide because the economy will have rebounded to the greatest levels ever seen.  But, Trump being Trump, it really doesn't matter to him whether the virus is eradicated; it is only important to him that it appears to be.  So, he has taken control of the data from the CDC so that he can control the narrative, and tell us things are getting better when they are getting worse, and more and more people are getting sick and dying.  I expect to hear things like ""never mind what is inside all those refrigerated trucks near the hospitals; the important thing is all of the jobs we created for the drivers.  It is the biggest increase in refrigerator truck driver jobs anyone has ever seen!""  I remain stunned at what we are letting him get away with."

Trump doesn't have to do what Fauci suggests to do because - as critics like to point out - there are other considerations than healthcare challenges factoring into complex decisions in such multifaceted crisis the country and world is going through now. 

Trump is the President and he should say and own up to what his decision and strategy are for the best of the country - even if Fauci's recommendations are not fully heeded. But Trump should step forward and say: this is my decision and I take full responsibility for it.

In this pandemic the US is a badly functioning third world nation. You do not even know how many died in a particular week until months later, and then the data might still be flawed or manipulated. Nothing to do with the CDC, it is some individual states acting incompetently and uncaring. Not surprisingly when the ""coroner"" in quite a few states might very well be an unemployed dog catcher befriended with the local mayor.

The CDC do try to monitor excess deaths in the US, but when only an estimated 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days it is an impossible job, and worthless in any even remotely adequate pandemic response.

On Covid testing the CDC is doing much better, as the results are collected from the health authorities ordering and paying for the tests. But the fast increasing numbers do not please your president, so CDC is substituted with an entity under direct control of a bankrupt casino huckster befriended with the Senate leader.

So in the coming months official US numbers are likely to fall. Never mind the reality for the US citizens."
2020-07-15 19:33:47,It is ironic how Trump is talking trash about Dr. Fauci playing down the virus threat after pushing him to do so.
2020-07-15 20:03:15,"It seems that the usual playbook of the dysfunctional WH, and another example of the lack of leadership of Trump, is to allow people in his administration to undermine anyone who doesn't march to the same tune as Trump and the other extremists and then take no responsibility in any way shape or form.

2020-07-15 21:01:58,"What someone says about you says more about who they are, how they view the world, and their relationship with their self more than about who or what you really are. Rather than trying to solve the problem, someone is looking for a scapegoat to take the blame in order to save face. The pandemic facing this world is not really the coronavirus, but an epidemic of person-itis of epic proportions. We take everything so personally that we cannot even consider wearing a mask without it becoming an issue of identity. How our beliefs so define who we are. And we are willing to defend our beliefs when those same beliefs fly in the face of common sense.

The path of peace is to have no opinion. It is through abiding in an impersonal nature that one begets peace of mind - which is a true reflection of the heart. Please leave Dr. Fauci alone. He is trying to do some good in this world regardless of the daunting circumstances that confronts him."

Imagine what the writer of ""Dr. Strangelove"" could do with the real-life characters we have before us as the Coronavirus runs rampant.

What is most important is to keep as many of us as possible alive and well. A face mask and social distancing is a cheap price to pay to keep us in good shape. If we can't get the man in the White House to do his duty by us, we need to protect ourselves and our fellow Americans. Live safely, shop safely, exercise safely, and check up on each other safely.

2020-07-15 20:49:31,Trump struggles everyday intellectually. He he is conceptually deprived. He cannot talk and have brain activity at the same time so he thinks with his mouth. Concepts are extremely difficult for him to process. So no small wonder during pandemic it's a crisis. An algorithm very predictable. He should resign.....
2020-07-15 21:00:34,"The Trump administration and the Presidentq himself never fail to shock and amaze me. They want the data so that our chief executive can edit, tinker, reformat it, etc so as to help create the effect they are striving to achieve among FOX viewers. In Trump’s case, at least according to the NYT’s stupefyingly long list of his prevarications, he is not above outright lying when it’s in our national best interests. And if course, if he is absolutely certain remaining in office is in the Country’s best interest, then Easy, Peasey, Japanesee, he can do whatever he likes in good conscience. I’ve been told he learned that many years ago at The U of PA’s Wharton School of Business, however I’ve been unable to verify that notion by obtaining his transcripts, so I’m not absolutely positive he attended there. He might have paid his ghost writer to sit in his seat.

2020-07-15 21:06:18,"With the novel coronavirus, it's very simple: no pain, no gain.  If people aren't willing to make sacrifices to contain the spread of the virus, then Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Idaho, Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri happen.  In this connection, there's Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma announcing -- without apology and with no sense of irony -- that he's been infected, confessing he has no idea how he got infected, and yet still refusing to wear a mask, socially distance, etc.

One bright spot:  Dr. Anthony Fauci has shown the WH how an adult actually behaves.  His response to the slurs to which he's been subjected was spot on.  Bravo.

As for Peter Navarro, it's beyond obnoxious for him to be pointing a finger at Fauci for not having been right 100% of the time.  As Paul Krugman has pointed out six ways from Sunday, Navarro has been wrong, oh, 100% of the time within his sphere of ""expertise"" -- the economy.  Yet (unlike Fauci) he has refused to acknowledge any of his errors.  You know, like claiming the U.S. was going to have runaway inflation, or that trade wars are a great idea.  Navarro is a self-confessed Trump sycophant, as this quote of his makes clear:  “My function, really, as an economist is to try to provide the underlying analytics that confirm [Trump's] intuition. And his intuition is always right in these matters.” 

Now, let's all man/woman up, wear masks, wash our hands, socially distance, and self-quarantine if we feel unwell."

Should require the removal from office, NOW, of Trump and Pence. We are in dire crisis now; we can’t wait until November.

Senate Republicans, give the signal to the House that it’s time to remove Trump and Pence, and it can be done quickly.

Yes, it’s time for our first woman president, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House. And she will only serve six months, until January 20. But it will break the ice for a woman president, and most importantly allow the United States of America to recover with science and rational thinking and executive branch competence."

2020-07-15 21:21:06,"It seems to me that the public sharing of all COVID-19 data should be demanded by every American. 

We are the nation of free speech, and this policy of the White House to filter data to the CDC reeks of censorship."
2020-07-15 21:11:41,"Dr. Fauci is right Let's all stop the nonsense"" including Dr. Fauci's lack of focus from the very beginning of his talk, talk, talk on popular TV talk shows. Popularity is fickle and treacherous and that has placed him in a dog house after being in the white house press briefings We were and remain a nation from top to bottom unprepared for complying with the very basic CDC guidelines of wearing proper masks properly. At the beginning our supply chain of masks was pathetic but now masks of all kinds and design are abundant. Black masks matter now more than ever, Trump wears them and so does Biden and many others. As a self appointed mask police with gentle persuasion, I have given up politely telling people in closed and crowded public places to pull their sagging masks over their nostrils. Some are okay and thankful, others say my employers don't provide me and still others more or less tell me to mind my own beeswax. A lady at an ethnic grocery store when told to pull mask over her nostrils said ""I am okay"" I held my tongue tight although I wanted to say you may be okay getting infected but what if you are infected and you infect the customers who wear a mask as required by your store but wear it the same way you do. Anyway I give up and that brings me back to Dr. Fauci and what he should focus on. Dr. Fauci should focus on overseeing a deployable vaccine to COVID-19 pronto before cows come home or the entire cavalier and careless US population becomes COVID-19 positive."
2020-07-15 21:18:51,"If hospitals across the country are preparing accurate statistical information for presentation to the Trump administration, they can just as easily send the information to the CDC at the same time. 

Preventing any COVID related information from delivery to the CDC is clearly and unequivocally another deceitful act to support the ongoing lies and evasion of this administration.  If this does not get a strong condemnation from every elected official, we will know that they support the lies and deceit of Trump over the interests of all other American citizens."
2020-07-15 21:29:00,"The attacks on Dr. Fauci directly point to an Administration that does not have its eye on the right ball. 

Their focus should be on the health and safety of our nation, not Trump’s re-election. 

It’s ironic to me that, if they had taken COVID-19 seriously, from the beginning, and done absolutely everything they could to be ready for its arrival on our shores, Trump might have cake walked his way to re-election. Instead, because he’s been so worried about his re-election rather than the People of this nation, he has alienated voters. 

Do the job well, and you get re-elected. Do the job poorly, leading Americans to lose jobs and die lonely deaths in overcrowded hospitals, and you won’t be re-elected. 

The survival of this nation is what is important, not the survival of Trump’s Presidency."
2020-07-15 21:25:12,"Dr. Fauci is between a rock and a hard place...  Or should I say between lack of federal leadership for whom he's beholden to advise with impunity, and a 'culture war' that distracts from public safety.  If for no other reason than to remain in place as a voice that does more good than harm, the trade-off is diplomacy to appease an Administration that does more harm than good.  Dr. Fauci has been here before...  The late author, playwright and activist Larry Kramer went toe-to-toe with this young Epidemiologist in the 80's with a rabid conviction that AIDS was the deadly result of a virus infecting thousands of Gay men that his Republican Administration ignored.
No idea what Dr. Fauci's memoirs will reveal about the risk-vs-reward a senior health official employs to keep his voice for the greater good, but it should be a good read!"
2020-07-15 21:25:51,"You have to admire Dr. Fauci's fortitude, patience and resilience. It's hard for anyone to endure constant harassment in the workplace. For someone who is so eminent, internationally esteemed and experienced to have to endure the mocking of the president and his minions and have it be so public is just jaw-dropping."
2020-07-15 21:24:32,"Every day the President or his advisors attack someone.  It is clear that these attacks are planned out to protect the President's ego.  I find that amazing, and very disturbing.  The whole idea of spending any time at all figuring out who to attack that day is so bizarre.  What have we come to that this behavior is normalized, and even supported by large segments of the population?"
2020-07-15 21:27:04,"Walmart’s ‘new’ policy is just hollow PR. Last week at my local store they indeed had a person out front, but he did not inform people entering without masks of the requirement, despite a large sign saying they are required. Instead, he simply let them pass and angrily confronted ME for bothering him when I questioned his lack of action. I complained to HQ customer service which had the store manager call me. I was informed that Walmart policy prohibited confronting customers entering the store without a mask and they specifically exclude people from the requirement if they have an underlying health condition. Yet it’s precisely those people who are at high risk for Covid! By admitting those people without masks they are putting other customers and their staff in danger! When I read this article I again spoke with the manager who maintained that Walmart will still admit people not wearing masks! If Walmart really wants to act responsibly, stop admitting anyone without a mask and insist that those wearing masks do so properly while in the store. Just politely but firmly refuse entry. Or are profits and PR more important than the health of a large majority of its customers and employees? Right now, despite its self serving TV commercials, Walmart is NOT putting the well being of customers and staff at top priority. And The Times should ask more probing questions before simply restating corporate press releases."
2020-07-15 21:41:30,Dr. Fauci has too much intelligence and class to become enthralled in the stupidity coming from the WH. Trump probably had a good laugh at his Aide's writings and tactics. Just like a mean child would laugh at a poor kid being bullied.

Should I even waste my energy and time worrying about climate change anymore?
2020-07-15 21:42:30,"The nonsense is his myopic approach.  As a result, we have over 7 million new cases of child malnutrition due to the lockdown with many of those kids now having lifelong learning disabilities (Brookings Institute study).  We have skyrocketing domestic violence (UN study) and yesterday the NYT ran a piece that predicted a dramatic increase in social isolation deaths.  I could go on.  The human suffering resulting from Dr Fauci's lock-it-all-down approach is enormous and growing.

Yes, let's stop this nonsense and develop a comprehensive approach that takes into accounts all the key facets of society.  We need not just epidemiologists on the team, but sociologists, psychologists, economists, etc. so as to determine an approach that best balances infection rates with human suffering collateral damage.  This apparently was not done originally.  Even in this case, public health goes well beyond just epidemiology.

Yes, the Covid 19 calculus stinks.  But we need to stop the nonsense and take the full calculus of comprehensive societal impact into account."

Another lab officially reported over 75 percent positive test results, but upon further review modified their number down to 6.4 percent ... 12 times too high.

When he starts attacking people like Dr. Fauci who have absolutely nothing to gain by telling the truth during a pandemic it is time to realize that President Trump is indeed mentally unstable.

Then Donald Trump enters with his lying, selfish, greedy people circling him.  All of them  are only interested in their own well being and what they can steal.  His presidency is a sham. No respect for the law and no respect for the common men and women. Every chance he gets he denigrates people.

It’s one of the benefits to listening to scientists, we’re all slowly starting to open up now.

Second, Trump stop the name calling and criticism of Fauci.  For over the last half century, Fauci knows, and Trump has no clue about this pandemic.  Trump can't remember anything, nor speak, nor act coherently, for example, ie yesterday's purported ""News Conference"".

Third, Redfield is now a gutless non-participating  wonder as a scientist, allowing the White House to run the CDC, that he should be doing.

When you follow this disease which can ravage the lungs and other internal organs, the lasting effects of COVID are still unknown, and though there is the promise of a possible vaccine, there is still much not known. So please follow Dr.Fauci's infection control guidelines, Scientists worldwide confer with him because he is respected and his credentials are impeccable, and all must know that at the beginning of any major virus there are criterias that help with containment, where did it originate, how rampant is it, and how can it be transferred to patients.

That only means exposing both school faculty and parents/grandparents of students, hundreds of thousands of people at elevated to extreme risk of contracting Covid-19, to young people who will either become ill themselves or silent transmitters of the disease.
Cutting the CDC from the loop means science is totally out of the picture of developing better treatment or, eventually, possibly, an effective vaccine.
“Warp Speed” vaccine development is as imaginary as the source of the phrase - Star Trek’s instant 0 to 10 to the nth’s times the speed of light travel system, developed, the TV/movie legend goes, by one stoner physicist working with WW III surplus found lying around the remains of the Earth.

We have cursed other  countries, primarily China, accusing them of not releasing complete case and death figures but it seems we are again about to be the best at something awful.

Or is she angling for a job since “this gig” runs out in the next few months? 

The real answer — she is her father; without decency, without true etiquette (the “etiquette” you see is fabricated, just like her fathers “wealth”) and dozens of other poser characteristics — it’s all a poorly “balanced” facade of fraud. 

In that house, they use the terms “fancy” and “classy” which alone shows you that they know nothing about real wealth or luxury. To them a polished brass rail is both “classy and fancy.” 

Tasteless.

After the peak, experience from around the world indicates that it will be about 6 to 7 weeks until case levels descend to a minimally sustainable level where reopening can be contemplated. That is a total of 8 to 10 weeks optimistically.

That means somewhere around September 15th to  October 1st, would be the start date for a Phased and monitored reopening.

Several days later she received a letter from the lab saying her test was positive. In Oregon we’re told cases are way up yet there are only 150 people in the hospitals that have been tested positive. Oregon has 6,111 staffed beds. We’re told nothing about these new cases.

Some people will say I have no grounds for suggesting that H&HS can be corrupted.  And that's true.  I should give them the benefit of the doubt.

2020-07-16 00:30:54,"Today’s tally of new coronavirus cases is about 65k. I am wondering if a bit more light could be shed on what precisely “today’s tally” means.

We know that there are non-trivial wait times when it comes to getting a test result back. Of course, one also hears that these wait times can range anywhere from 10  days to less than a day. (Depending on the location, broader testing regimen, provider, capacity, etc.) I figure that the CDC at best knows test results shortly before the patient. 

So would it be correct to infer that the ~65k cases reported today represent a combination of tests taken over the past few weeks? Not a simple lag, but a mixture of lags?

At the same time, I would guess that - conditional on a death being registered as Covid-caused/related (as opposed to people who may be dying “natural” deaths that are, in fact, undiagnosed COVID cases) - the reporting time is somewhat shorter. (I am, admittedly, ignorant of whether reported deaths all are based on autopsies - which could entail their own lag.)

So my follow-up is: to what extent does the apparent lag in death tolls reflect differential reporting lags?

Perhaps differences in reporting lags could be used to get a better nowcast of cases?

Finally, I hope this is obvious but these questions exist independently of conditional probability questions related to test availability, etc.

This question is really more applicable to to the stats dashboards but I thought I’d see if I could get a response here."

As the arguably leader of the free world, I implore you to consider supporting a national lockdown for the next 45-60 days in the US. In addition to a national lockdown, I ask that you implement a national mask mandate for all 50 states, whenever citizens are in an environment where social distancing is not practical. This mandate needs to have appropriate penalties from local jurisdictions. 

If we can just seriously address these two issues, I think we will be closer to reducing the infection rates and, within two months, most states will be able to reopen. 

It WILL require a national mandate. Let’s work together."

We don’t know enough about the virus at this point to be able to open safely and be confident that we are not putting the wider community at risk (starting with teachers, staff, parents, grandparents and moving outwards to the rest of the community).  What if we make the school year longer in the coming years for as long as it takes for the students to catch up?  The amount of time this takes will vary across the country depending on the severity of the outbreak in different communities.  And we limit in person schooling (with social distancing) to those with special needs and the kids of essential workers if they don’t have someone who can be with their child.  It’s clearer every day that we’re going to be dealing with the threat of this virus for a long time.

And it all sits in the seat of the despicable performance of Donald John Trump. I put the insane Covid 19 numbers on his shoulders. And it is not that this is a complex nuanced problem to solve. All he has to do is have a clear, centralized plan for the distribution of supplies and testing equipment ; a willingness to consult with other world leaders, doctors, scientists and health policy experts to have the best plan to protect the greatest numbers of people and a clear, singular message of how to behave during such a time: social distance, stay home unless it is necessary to leave and WEAR A MASK. 
The incredible weight of Trump's   influence is so clearly seen in the words and behaviors of his followers. What he says and does makes a difference. It would be so very simple for him to model wearing a mask and to make very clear that this simple step makes a difference.  Instead we have this absurd fight between Republicans and everyone else on civil liberties. And the best this absurdity of a president can do is fan the flames."

People have to also stop congregating in large groups and going to bars. This is what has brought our numbers back up in many places.

They are planning to have only “up to 4 weeks” of online school before they start requiring teachers to be at school sites and having 50-percent of students returning.  That means even in elementary schools that include hundreds of kids over 10 yrs old (a key age when they become as vulnerable to COVID as teens and adults) along with hundreds of younger children — none of whom can be relied on to consistently and properly wear PPE including masks and who by law are not required to wear them.  At some of the larger elementary schools, 50-percent capacity still means 300-400 children at one time and as many as 16 children plus a teacher, all from different households, together in classroom that have questionable if any ventilation and sometimes not enough desks or tables in good enough condition so children have to double up at the ones that do work well.

It is so disappointing and disconcerting to see people out on the street without any mask or any type of virus protection.    It just makes the place feel that much less safe, given the fact that there is currently a huge spike of corona cases in Florida.

The anti science sentiments it evokes make me think that the little information people are receiving  from newspapers or television is ignored.    It is a little like being in a place where people simply sigh resignedly and expect that there will be no resolution to this  - so why bother gearing up?  

One gets the distinct sense by the masklessness that somehow they have experienced this type of irresponsible response to a crisis before and have learned to live with the negative consequences - permanently.   

Is this what happens when people live under authoritarian types of rule and governments  - they become conditioned to passivity -  to learned helplessness, and therefore think no measure will help, even wearing a basic mask?"

I wish they would go to Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey or Russia and see what lack of freedom really means. Spoiled children. Wearing a mask if just common sense in this situation."

As a newspaperman who covered drugs and related topics from my university days 1974-1978 until a job-related injury ended my career in 2000 - one I had planned to continue until 2027 ...
1) The nation periodically undergoes a phenomenon involving “hard drugs”, addictive non-psychedelics that no one has ever been able to explain to me - or, as far as I know, explain at all: After a cycle of roughly a decade, primary hard drugs of choice switch between uppers - cocaine, amphetamines and the like, etc., and downers - from “mother’s little helpers”, diazapams (Valium and its analogs) to opioids.
The rate of use of more recreational psychedelics, from low and legal in many places marijuana, to LSD-25; what is now called Ecstasy (analogs, STP-64, etc.have been around for decades) psychoactive mushrooms and cacti have remained their steady place on the market for more than half a century.
Your article contains several misconceptions - “popular wisdom” that’s just plain wrong - fentanyl and analogs began replacing natural opioids in the 1980s, at least from info police and ER workers gave me when bad batches came into town and medical facilities would be overwhelmed with ODs. The why is simple - 24/7 factories easily outdo single-annual-crop production. And material 100 to 1000 times the strength of heroin is much easier to ship.
Lastly, little if any of this has to do with physicians relieving real pain that destroys the lives of folks like me, who need to live again."

Oppositional behavior is contagious.   Non-compliance is viral.   Shapeshifting, lying, silencing, bullying by our President is stoking the fires of a society in a spiral.

If it’s not election destabilization, it’s targeting our troops for assassination, destabilizing Syria to exasperate the refugee crisis, sending female intelligence agents to infiltrate conservative groups like the NRA, bullying our allies Europe, carrying out assassinations using chemical agents in England. They routinely harass our military planes and ships in international waters. 

We should suspend all but the essential diplomatic relations with Russia, recall all Americans living and working in Russia and expel all Russian citizens from American soil.

But then in the US, there is such extreme dissonance and divide when it comes to the topic of ""to wear or not to wear""a face mask, let alone even believing that this virus is real, highly contagious and deadly.

Since Russian hackers are attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research, is it too much of a leap to expect and/or assume they will attempt to steal the election in November?

The Times has reported (a few days ago) on estimates that the COVID-related job losses have also yielded a coming drop of 1%-2% in the health uninsured rate, below the current misearable 91% in the Census stats.

This is because the ACA in its current shape has serious problems, and note Paul Krugman has said this, not denied it, in his columns.

Note the 91% covered, and coming 89%-90% from the Census Bureau statistics understate the problem, and actually misrepresent the stats.

A good chunk of the 91% now counted as ""Insured"" actually don't have insurance.  Just a loan.

This is owing to Medicaid estate recovery practices in at least 10 states, including blue MA, MD, and NJ.

People in those states getting ACA expanded Medicaid or another Medicaid through their exchange (income to 138% Fed. Pov. Lvl, no asset cap) who are 55 or older have all of their medical bills paid out for now, but then, when they die, their children owe those bills from any estate left.

Currently, during the COVID crises, states like MA are bragging that they have automatically switched tens of thousands to expanded Medicaid, thus what a great job they are doing protecting people who have lost their jobs.  

Many of those people, or their children, are being passed a financial bomb if those people get expensively sick.

(For a bit on this, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Which I actually wrote.)"

Russians hacking Americans? It's all a witch hunt and Joe Biden did it and Hunter Biden did it and Obama did it and Stormy Daniels who Trump does not know and never met did it. Trump did not do it because he never is at fault or does anything including his job.

The data should be public and not a secret. The vaccine should be public and not a secret. Everyone (especially the Trump organized crime family who should get it first) should have access especially the rich who we all know will be second in line.

Mr. President, one of your staunchest demographic groups is the elderly. They are also the ones most likely to die if they get infected with the coronavirus. You are selectively killing off more of your supporters than others’ supporters.

What the US should really worry about is the hacking of your own democracy, and you haven't managed to clean up the crimes from your 2016 election. Likely because it wasn't just the Russians but lot's of complicit US billionaire interests too.

I choose my places of exercise carefully so I am able to keep my distance. 
While I exercise, I do not want to or can wear a mask - hard to do an aerobic workout with a mask on while dripping with sweat.  Now, I do religiously wear a mask anytime I am in closer proximity to others outside and, especially, anytime I have to share an indoor space with anyone else, regardless of distance.  And, by wearing a mask, I mean wearing a close-fitting mask without any valves, and one that covers both my mouth and nose entirely.  
Also, how about some information on the ""masks"" that have exhaust valves - widely worn and advertised, but aren't those borderline useless when it comes to protecting others?"

Director Pompeo of Kansas chartered several planes that returned citizens in Wuhan back here, but they landed at military bases. To me, that was the first red flag. Since that time, a concerted effort by Trump led Republicans has deterred our people from caring for themselves. The beginning spread of the virus was localized in predominately liberal Democrat leaning states and cities. At that point I began to suspect malicious intent by Republicans towards Democrats. Now, after many months of Republicans seemingly cultivating the spread of the disease, the intelligence agencies come out with this story accusing the Russians of seeking our knowledge of the disease I think for bad reasons. But, they indicated the hacks were directed at a strategic alliance, not so much a medical one. Our nation, Britain, and Canada is a strategic alliance, more than a medical group.

When it comes to saving ourselves from economic collapse there is no ""can do."" Because the insidious, treacherous propaganda that our government is not OURS has been so deeply ingrained in millions of Americans, we have no ""can do"" mentality, just the myths of ""rugged individualism"" and ""personal freedom.""

So that it can be made more readily available to Russia? They get the real info, and our health agencies and the public get the Trump-massaged version.""

Quite frankly, as someone in a vulnerable age group, I see these new street clusters as potential ""super-spreader sites"".

Clusters of unmasked people gathered on the streets like this is simply risky behavior.

The Czarist regime of Muscovy, using its Okhrana, made Russia a land of privileged class versus the serfs, with no business class.

While we are on the topic of reality - do risks associated with opening schools  have anything to do with base rates for infection in the population at large? If so, then examples of other countries opening schools are generally going to misrepresent the real risks for doing so in the US, given high rates of infection among a population in the US that seems to have lost its herd protection instincts. 

I note that students typically come as a package deal in families with a polygenerational composition, so risks could transmit from children to higher at-risk adults and then to even higher at-risk  older adults. And maybe some of those parents are healthcare providers??

They all recommended that to slow the spread of this virus and thus buy time to find a cure and vaccine we should all wear a face mask.  A simple cloth or paper covering that would limit the possibility of us spreading this virus among us.

Now, since this society is filled with well-educated people, of course, they all willingly donned such masks and thereby stemmed the spread of the virus and, as a consequence, save innumerable lives.

Now you might argue -- what society would ever possibly do such a simple thing as wear a face mask?  Certainly not America where such mask-wearing would be a breach of a person's freedom.  

Such a place must be simply a fantasy land, you would say.

Or it could be China...."

     Are there, in the United States, general criminal behaviour laws to protect to protect the public and/or  individual persons from being potentially exposed to known dangerous diseases by others?
     Could it be covered in or by a Executive Order?
     This is so ridiculous (sorry… I’m beyond exasperated, please pardon my bluntness) as it would only take strong encouragement and public education… but so many “have to be told” and even then because of the attitude has now been so deeply imbedded it’s going to take a great deal of effort to get the point across. The longer transmission occurs the longer the cycle will just keep rolling. 
      I wish you luck, your going to need all you can get,  I really do wish you all … good health.

The Corona drug and treatment tracker is a good indication as to how far we have come since the middle of Mar. when COVID-19 made its land fall in USA. I would expect that fatality could decrease from the current 4.4% to 1% in a month as long as the antivirals, the ventilators and the dexamethasone are readily available. Just like the HIV pandemic is no longer considered as an untreatable disease with no vaccine, COVID-19 can become a treatable disease waiting for a vaccine. While global cases are surging, COVID-19 is not a death sentence as long as proper medical support is available and treatment of symptoms is possible without hospitalization and if there is a serious shortness of breath, ventilators and adequate oxygen supply provided. If there is progression to hyper inflammation chronic stage then dexamethasone and anticlotting agents could be provided. To prevent fatalities among overweight or obese persons and diabetics, weight loss could be encouraged with the urgency of now and blood glucose levels could be brought to normal level.

It’s disgusting that companies are being awarded billion-dollar/euro contracts to develop a Covid vaccine.
How about pooling our knowledge, making each step and mis-step public - and insuring nobody will gain any direct profit developing a working Covid vaccine.
Let nations make equitable donations to the World Health Organization - which Trump just pulled the US out of - to pay the costs of development - both to the successful and honest competitors who fail - then hand over the working vaccine to the world’s med companies to manufacture at no profit, except in the eyes of those who get to live.

Also, if we blindly accept the magical thinking that children are ""immune"" to Covid-19 and can't spread it as a rationale for rushing to reopen schools, what about the teachers and staff? They are not children. What happens when my child's teacher gets ill and has to self-quarantine, and wait who knows how long for test results? Subs? Many of them are retired teachers (i.e., over 65) and unlikely to subject themselves to the virus for a couple hundred bucks. And if enough teachers get ill (add more numbers, with flu season approaching), the bank of credentialed, vetted (background checked), and quality substitutes will be taxed. In a normal year, on any given day, it was already next to impossible to find enough subs to cover out of the classroom teachers. (I have 30+ years as a public school teacher)

Pence: ""This is going to go away by Memorial Day.""

Such tests are not medically very useful because patients who test positive cannot be told to quarantine themselves and contract tracing is too late to be very effective, but they are politically useful by giving the appearance that something is being done.

What should happen is that the test companies should not be paid for tests whose results they do not deliver in, say, 48 hours.  They will then stop giving more tests than they can process in a timely manner, and tell the people who cannot get tested that more capacity is needed and should have been put in place, organized by the federal government since organization by the marketplace has failed.  

Rather than being honest, the testing companies join in perpetuating the useful fiction that something useful is being done.  We cannot expect such honesty from them in the age of Trump, who loves fictions that are useful to him and has absolutely no tolerance for or interest in outside reality.  

We could hope that some of our major media companies would not go along in perpetuating the fiction, but since the truth would discredit just about everyone, it remains pretty much unsaid."

Now the teaser. “If it takes the lily pads 48 days to cover the pond completely, how long will it take for the pond to be covered halfway?”

Trump's niece Mary Trump warned Americans Wednesday night via live television interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, that a reelection win by Donald Trump would be more dangerous to the U.S. than his first term was; and would result in the ""end of the American experiment.""

But that end could come even sooner should Trump and some of his key associates become closer to being totally unhinged by January 2021; due to Donald Trump already being the most dangerous thing ever to appear on Earth for not only mankind, but also the Earth's survival itself."

Also, where and when are counties and states actually enforcing their mask and/or social distancing mandates, and by what means?  Are law enforcement officers keeping track, in any manner, the number of times a shift that they have to issue warnings (since, it’s my impression, that’s the most they are willing to do so far)?  Besides the subversión of the serious attention and compliance folks should give to public health mandates/rule of law, doesn’t lack of real enforcement, or at least record keeping, rob out public health planners (and thus us all) of quite useful data about where and when and what levels of compliance or non-compliance is happening?  Couldn’t such data be useful in building not just understanding of human behavior during pandemics that could be helpful in future pandemics, but also in building efficiencies here and now regarding targeted messaging and other interventions specific to and more effective in certain neighborhoods or communities or age groups or according to whatever other biosociocultural  indicators the data reveals?

I suspect shortages of all of these workers will become evident from the openings and subsequently as these individuals become ill and are absent from work for prolonged periods. Some will never return. Children will become infected and return home and be in public spreading the virus. Federal leadership and response has been throttled by the President as his response team including Pence have been basically benched.

That means no school reopening in large segments of the country. That means more shelter in place orders. That means an even bigger and longer hit to our economy. 

If our country was under foreign attack, we wouldn’t stand for 1,000 casualties, let alone a quarter million. At that level we’d probably go nuclear.

I think these maskless people are trying to gain some control in an out-of-control situation, which is what we are in now.  And they are really angry.  Our Federal leadership contradicts our health experts who could save us, so angry, maskless people don’t have any guidance.  Instead, our Federal leadership insists Republicans, from Governors to local leaders, not follow safe practices resulting in higher sickness and fatality counts.  

We are experiencing needless loss of life, illnesses with long-term symptoms, lost jobs and soon, lost homes - all because one man doesn’t understand how dangerous a pandemic is and doesn’t care.  We will loose our government because there is seemingly no one - not one person - with the power to protect our lives.  This means the majority of Americans will stop believing that Government can make their lives better and protect them from greed and violence and sickness.  It is all going away and I don’t know what will replace it other than a big banking syndicate because that’s probably who Trump reports to.

Not being compliant with simple safety rules which we have not been used to is resulting in these records. The messages for safety that are being communicated from the white house, state houses and city hall are not being followed. 
1 ) Spread out, get fresh air and keep safe distance (more the merrier) from each other including friends and family members.
2) Wash hands with soap or sanitize hands when anyone of anything gets touched.
3) Wear proper masks properly in all enclosed public spaces

Additionally spread if you don't have fever or any other symptoms or have tested negative for COVID-19 antigen or RNA to wherever you are allowed in and do like what a large number of NY city residents did go to your second home or just drive or motor bike across our vast land, camp out and stay orders.

2020-07-17 14:54:19,Finally Kayleigh came out and said it: “Science should not stand in the way of this” (school reopening).  That sums up the trump administration’s views about every issue: Don’t let science stand in the way of destroying the environment or setting sane public health policy.
2020-07-17 13:54:21,"“When he says open, he means open and full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school,” she said. “The science should not stand in the way of this.”

2020-07-17 04:47:22,Democrats; I now understand the Trump insistence on having kids in schools despite the danger of illness. He may be planning roundups of people when their children are under other care. You Democrats are going to need to grow up mighty quick and prepare to defend yourselves.
2020-07-17 16:28:33,"In Florida, I am a college student returning to Stetson University for the Fall semester and I am highly concerned. My school, Stetson University, already reported 5 cases within our student-athlete community, so what makes them think that they can control the virus during the Fall? They can’t.

Also, all colleges and universities reopening for the Fall sought COVID-19 liability protections on May 28th from Congress, (PRIOR to the 2020-2021 school year). What message does that send to us if they are already trying to avoid liability? The law only applies liability when a college doesn’t take reasonable efforts. So, are these institutions taking reasonable efforts at all if they are already avoiding liability? 

From what I see, the school board, executives, politicians and other higher-uppers across the country are more concerned about politics, money and power."

Seems like Science matters when it comes to signing waivers though!
2020-07-17 21:15:19,"OK - class, we're going to parse what Trump's latest press secretary says, and examine it for logic and evidence.

Section 1 
""“When he says open, he means open and full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school,” she said. “The science should not stand in the way of this.”

Q1 - Is she saying science should be ignored for political expediency? 

Section 2
""Ms. McEnany then referenced data ... that indicated the risk of children contracting the coronavirus was low compared with seasonal influenza.
“The science is on our side here,” Ms. McEnany said""

Q2 - Does the fact that the risk of catching coronavirus might be lower than the risk of catching something kids seem to catch all the time mean kids aren't at risk of catching coronavirus if all are stuck in classrooms and hallways every day?

Section 3
""adding that the United States is an “outlier” among other countries sending children back to school.""

Q3 - is the US an outlier in its approach to school openings?

Answer key
Q1 - yes, she is

Q2 - of course not, it just means they'd be at risk of catching either or both. Schools are infection factories.

Q3 - that was a giveaway since the article pointed out that YES we're an outlier because they're trying to shove our kids back into classrooms before, rather than after, the incidence of infections declines to what's considered safe levels."
2020-07-17 20:43:07,The idea of opening schools while the country is experiencing the highest level of corona infections ever is one of the most ignorant ideas ever proposed by this government. I hope that teachers and parents will boycott the schools. Should we ask teachers and kids to become human guinea pigs so Trump can delude himself that everything is fine?

2020-07-15 17:23:11,"Epidemic diseases with a reproduction factor over 2 will continue to ""burn"" through a susceptible population until herd immunity surrounds it. That occurs with either acquired immunity via infection and disease survival, or vaccine. Don't expect a vaccine right away; Moderna's is in Phase II and almost III, so even if successful it won't be in mass production and distributed for more than 6 months. Best case, six months to deliver initial doses another 6 to get to you). 
The virus will continue to spread until it's stopped. 
There are signs that permanent COVID immunity might not be attained and the best could be ""months"" of immunity after recovery from the bug. But you have to catch it first. So it is most likely that the disease will continue to spread, checked only by barrier nursing of the ill, masking and distancing. We’re getting better at mitigating serious illness, but the case fatality rates are high enough to be worrisome. Per Hopkins, they are very high (20+%) in less developed countries, and somewhere around 4% for us (accurate data is hard to find). Trump has directed hospitals NOT to forward data to CDC, a potential disaster. 
Conclusion: the fulminant/explosion we are seeing is consistent with a contagious uncontrolled disease. It will likely burn through for another year at least. The current G614 variant is reportedly 10x contagious than the first/Wuhan version. Wear your masks. There are no miracles, and no one competent to create one soon."

During the 1918-1920 Flu Pandemic those cities that promptly implemented and maintained practical measures such as social distancing, quarantining and mask wearing suffered less losses and had no additional long-term  adverse economic effects. 
Other cities didn't fare as well. 
There were a variety of responses to the reality of the illness then, as there is now. For example,  in San Francisco an 'anti-mask' bunch was protesting the wearing of masks back then, and there were conspiracy theories about the origins of the pandemic (first cases reported were rom Kansas. ) Now, just like then, there was dispute about 'actual numbers, of the sick and dead, suppression of the actual numbers of deaths (globally estimated for that epidemic to be between 50-100 million.) 
That pandemic came in  3  waves .starting in the Spring of 2018, then in August of 2018 with a deadlier pneumonia and death rate, and with a 3rd big wave in Winter of 2018..followed by a smaller wave in 2019."

The corporate posture was that employees needed to wear masks but there were no such requirements for clients. My wife and I, although wearing masks ourselves, walked out of the gym.

I emailed the gym, outlining both the general medical concerns with links to several recent medical references (medical literature such as NEJM and PNAS, not the public press). There was no indication they would make masking mandatory--just a loose suggestion that masks were optional. 

My wife and I dropped our longstanding membership. With corporate behaviors such as the one described, it is hard to see how we fare better during re-opening attempts, where places such as the aforementioned gym are resistant to aggressively fostering public cooperation.

Perhaps it's time to have a federal program that incentivizes child care. The federal government could train and pay some out-of-work people to run small (5 -7 children) in their homes.

American friends have a casual approach to the virus, that is,  ""sometimes masks"",  ""sometimes not"".  They have gone to packed beaches and crowded locations. There's no one to tell them to put on mask, or go home, or to hand out a fine if they refuse. 

The Trump administration and elected Republicans are not enthused at following the EU model, but it has worked. 

A national and strict plan, backed by fines and law enforcement, must be put in place.  People must stay at home, wear masks when out for essentials, and work/school from home -- for at least two months, on penalty of hefty fine.

While Wall Street continues to display their never ending ""pigs at the trough"" mentality; the vast majority of Americans are struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table for their families. This is what 4 years of Trumpocracy has brought you to. If there is ANY sanity left in the U.S. (??) these days; Trump will get the thrashing he so richly deserves on Nov. 3; and once that garbage is gone; Joe Biden can try and begin to undo all the disaster that the Republicans have wrought in their twisted mad 1% mentality of a nation by the rich/ for the rich/ and no one counts but the rich.

This  plan  to reopening is primarily targeted to corporate and banking  America. The flow of red ink continues to stain their balance sheets at a fast rate. Any lose of lives is viewed nothing more than collateral  damage. This is the reason Trump places the decision making on state governances. From the words of a liar,  'I am not your enemy.'

As this virus that has yet to be tamed continues to kill people at exponential rates, the talk of a mad rush to reopening schools to our children, our teachers and all who come into contact with them, all so we the worker bees can return to our work stations is so far beyound a heinous act. For goodness sake, we still live in the mask or no mask debate.

If anybody up on the hill has the courage, the moral fortitude that speaks to any compassion, any empathy, any respect  for all human life the Heros Act must be passed today. This bill is not a 'free meal ticket' ! It is a necessary pause that gifts time needed to figure out how to coral Covid-19.

2020-07-16 14:25:01,"“Recent events have breathed new life...”.  For sure, children, but let’s not blame the medical and scientific community, the WHO, or the CDC for denying aerosols for so long while thousands died.  Or for touting masks as protection for others, not for the wearers. The sad truth is that, once you admit that a virus will float for hours and remain infective, and also have no idea if there is a minimum amount that can cause disease, the world as we know it stops cold. No food chain, no transport, no safety in the outdoors - nothing but unstoppable plague. 
So if you now realize that your 20 percent filtration of a cloth mask is say, four times less safe than a N95, but this country is still incapable of making masks.  That your mask actually serves to protect you, as well as others.  That around a third of us won’t take vaccines, ensuring permanent hazard for everyone.  That there is no way the built environment can be altered for safety in decades.
Then, children, you’ve got the outline, and the story remains to be written."

Sequester the vulnerable and let the rest of us get back to normal while a vaccine is developed.  Let the vulnerable go around in masks, goggles, and gloves.  Save all of that PPE for them."

2020-07-16 17:03:30,"Why would coronavirus transmission be different than other airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza and meningitis? 

The spread of these other airborne illnesses has been proven to be significantly reduced with natural ventilation. Opening doors and windows directly makes the risk of contagion much lower than relying on shared over-recirculated indoor air from mechanical HVAC systems.

Greater attention to the spread of indoor airborne illness transmission should call for a re-think and a revolution in architecture of the future.

How much of our current built environment from mega-skyscapers to hospitals, luxury condos and hotels, and our climate controlled retro-fitted institutional facilities rely on HVAC systems?"
2020-07-16 17:03:41,"This is very interesting, but there remains the issue of the infectious dose, the minimum quantity of virus necessary to infect an individual. So even though viruses may linger in small aerosols in the air, how long do they remain infectious, and how likely is exposure to diffuse aerosols of this sort to lead  to an actual infection? Difficult questions."
2020-07-16 16:58:55,Masks will help protect against both aerosols and droplets I would think. So WEAR ONE!
2020-07-16 17:12:37,"Bottom line. Closed poor ventilated areas with people talking etc. and staying for a time is dangerous. 

Masks, of any types reduce the transmission  on contact but staying in a closed space will lessen its ability to protect.

We all know this, we all have that knowledge from years of the flu. This was obvious since march.

Problem? we have a non compliant population who choose to do what they want and then blame others when things happen.Its not waiting for some ill informed politician to wise up, its our responsibility.

Chinatown SF Ca. 20,000 in 22 blocks has 2 deaths and 24 cases. Why? they listened to the health people they all did as told, Our America, me first attitude , 135,000 deaths and counting."
2020-07-16 18:01:44,"Yes, we need science to get answers but long experience is also provides answers.  I was a army medical corpsman at the Fitzimmons Army Hospital in Denver Colorado in 1949 and 1950.
It was the Army’s Tuberculosis Hospital.  Every working day I wore a surgical mask whenever exposed to patients that were deemed infectious/contagious because they were providing sputum specimens containing live tubercle bacilli.  We changed our masks several times a day as the might become ineffective after use for several hours.  There never was doubt that one could become infected with TB either by aerosol particularly as expectorated sputum dried or by touching contaminated doorknobs or other fomites. 

There is no doubt that social distancing, masking, and hand washing are the most prudent precautions we need for the present pandemic.  Take it from an 89 year old Korean War veteran with lots of microbiological experience in the forty years following my experiences on the TB wards."
2020-07-16 18:26:42,"Thank you NYT for this excellent article.  The world needs more of these science based articles that are easy for everyone to understand.  It always seemed obvious to me that the primary mode of infection was via aerosols because otherwise the virus would not be so contagious and countries where people automatically wear masks (even without any government requirements) whenever a virus strikes clearly had much greater success controlling the virus.  If hand sanitizers were all that was needed we wouldn't see such a rapid spread.  Therefore, it should be also obvious that masks that can capture aerosols will protect the wearers.  The better the capture the better the protection.  How the CDC and WHO misunderstood the risks of aerosol transmission is astounding. Probably because they are medical doctors with expertise in the body but not in the science of fluid mechanics.   What are the implications of significant (if not primary) transmission via aerosols?  The country should have been mass producing N95 masks back in January.  Opening bars, restaurants other crowded indoor spaces before containment is sheer insanity. With respect to indoor ventilation, building owners should  install inexpensive HEPA filters in any recirculated air flow streams, which has always been required on airplanes.  Doctor and dentist offices should install HEPA air purifiers next to all patient treatment areas.  And so on."
2020-07-16 18:29:49,"What I really really cannot understand is why we all cannot have N95 masks.  Those are what we need to keep us a lot safer.  Yes, I get there is a shortage, and as a former RN I want health care workers to be protected. This pandemic has been going on for months, plenty of time to gear up production of PPI, and yet that doesn’t seem to have happened.  Such a simple thing really, that could save a lot of lives."
2020-07-16 19:40:21,"Science is greatly influenced by political decisions and biases.

We have barely begun researching how we are actually and comprehensively affected by our physical, social, and cultural environments.

Political ideology has the greatest effect on what people believe: Academic degrees do not free a person from biases.

Academic degrees nurture new forms of biases, most significantly those which have systemic relations with a person's social status.

Many committed practitioners of sciences argue about how science is the only sure way of opening and maintaining a mind.

Science can be of major help, but only if a person can maintain some awareness of the more the 30 forms of bias their mind can potentially maintain.

Viruses in the air around us?

This is now just becoming a subject of our culture's discourse?

We need to cut back on a few of our cultural investments, like exoplanets.

Starship fantasies can be nice, but we need more minds, discourse, and resources invested at the level of our biosphere."
2020-07-16 19:53:49,"This article doesn't mention another important fact: your immune system is constantly on the watch for viral particles, etc., and clears them out.   If your immune system is healthy it takes hundreds of particles of a given virus to overwhelm your natural defences.  Improving ventilation should reduce the accumulated viral load in the air and thus reduce the chances of individuals becoming infected.
  Now, of course, it is possible that a single large droplet that someone has just coughed up contains enough virus to infect someone.  But large droplets do not remain airborn very long.  Reducing the load of smaller infectious particles might make a major difference in infection rates.
  Yes, good ventilation will probably reduce infection rates.  And masks reduce infection rates.  We need to do as much as we can to get this under control."
2020-07-16 21:51:27,"One aspect of aerosol transmission of the virus is the futility of any kind of face mask short of the N95 standard in preventing the virus from being transmitted. Surgical masks and masks made from cloth are too porous to filter out the virus, which when airborne consists of microscopic particulates.

People in enclosed areas breathe each other's air. A contagious person wearing a cloth mask exhales the virus through their mask and into the room's confined air, where it can linger for hours. A co-worker also wearing a cloth mask is at risk of inhaling the virus through their mask and being infected.

The CDC and WHO finally have acknowledged aerosol transmission but have not mandated the use of N95-level masks. Why? Because virtually none are available to the public. Due to the federal administration's failure to sufficiently ramp up production early on, current N95 mask production is reserved for first responders and medical staff. As a result, nothing short of HEPA air filtration and robust outside air circulation can create a safe indoor environment. The only effective precaution individuals can undertake is to avoid shared indoor spaces.

At this point, nothing short of total lockdown, combined with national testing and contact tracing, can save the USA from being overwhelmed by Covid-19. But it is doubtful that the chaotic national administration could mount such a campaign, and even if it did, whether a divided population would participate. Dark days lie ahead."
2020-07-16 19:47:17,"This is really no mystery or discovery!! Any infectious agent has an ""infective dose"" ID50. An aerosolized agent thus requires a particular concentration to cause disease. Obviously an enclosed space with no wind currents to dilute a pathogen is exponentially more conducive to transmit a respiratory pathogen. furthermore, indoors there is no solar radiation (ultraviolet or simply heat) thus virus can remain infective for longer. No fancy technology or high speed cameras required factual information known for around 100 years!"

Enter an older building with spacious windows that open wide and you feel good. Or. alternatively, attend a conference in a stale-air, hermetically sealed modern hotel and try to stay awake during the presentation. Now add increased risk of Covid to the mix. Architects at your drafting tables, please draw in some windows that open wide."
2020-07-17 01:15:31,These tests are once again in lab type environments. How these actually relate to real world environments is still not known. We have been subjected to lab test results for years now that in fact have had no real relationship to anything in the real world. Science needs to relate or it becomes a joke. You can’t keep bombarding us with lab results without any real world studies to back up the data. Even peer reviewed studies are becoming suspect. We need scientists to be less about probability and more fact oriented. Creating fear unnecessarily is bad.
2020-07-17 01:29:56,"Well while these researchers wring their hands about how droplets and other particles move around, the rest of us will just have to use common sense and what our own eyes and ears tell us.

The real trouble is that we cannot properly assess the danger we face from the virus because the reported figures are not only erroneous, but often wrong . (no breakdown between deaths from pure Covid infection and those who suffered from complications or general ill health as well)  This is particularly the case in the UK, rather than in say Germany.
In the UK we are putting more (silly) restrictions in place AFTER the death rate has drastically slowed down. (airport restrictions and now face masks in shops). 
Consumers need confidence to shop - as this article so well explains. In continental Europe the people rightly have more confidence in their Government - and its health security measures - than we do in the UK."

Trump and his enablers are to blame for the humiliating failure that has brought us to this point, but so is any person who voted for him, and certainly anyone who intends to do so again. That’s because his election was the apotheosis of American exceptionalism, a roll of the dice on a manifestly unqualified person by people who were too decadent to treat a presidential election the way a company would treat an important hiring decision.

You want to read about the strife of healthcare workers - read about Lorna Breen, an ER doctor in NYC, who couldn’t go on

We have incredible freedoms in the US and the ability to look at the responses of other countries and to see what works. Why do we wait until the government closes down restaurants or tells us not to gather in large groups of people? As individuals we know what works, physical distancing and wearing masks.

I have no control over what anyone else chooses to do or not do.  All I can do is do my best to protect myself and my husband, which means we are adamant about wearing a mask, keeping a safe distance, and only going out to places to get groceries, medicine, gas, and cat food.  

Our decision to go without awhile longer vs. taking a gamble and venturing out to a restaurant or fly somewhere and possibly get contract this virus is pretty simple: we crave our health over any and everything else.

2020-07-14 12:32:02,"I seethe with anger every day over the utter incompetence and nonfeasance of our federal government.

The Public Health Service is a UNIFORMED service of the USA.  Why wasn’t it mobilized to fight the pandemic?  Why weren’t “COVID-Bonds” sold to help fund the efforts, including financial support for businesses and workers?  Why haven’t Americans been asked to come together as a community to fight this disease by wearing masks and deferring for a period of time their own gratification?

John Adams noted long ago that prosperity can have a deleterious effect on society.  He was a prescient man."
2020-07-14 13:09:18,"It should be obvious to all by now that Trump is a malignant character who hides his real motives to make himself look better in the eyes of the public.  He grabs hold of a bible and presents himself as a pious defender of religion and spirituality. Well, enough said for that.
 He now presents himself as an avuncular leader concerned with the growth and development of the children.  They should not be denied a full education--at the same time that he talks about cutting desperately needed funds for education. Schools must be opened, opened in the midst of  Covid-19 destruction --- dangerous for life and limb.  But the education of the youngsters is all-important. 
His real underlying motive is ---as always---the economy, which he regards as the key to defeating Biden.  If children are home, working parents cannot go to work, and if workers don't show up at work, the economy will lag, and economic growth will go down.  And this hurts his chances in November.  So he now cries crocodile tears for the childrens' education."

Conservatives will need to see a red state cripple itself.  It will be a humanitarian disaster for sure and an appalling level of suffering. Unfortunately, conservatives only learn by direct experience. Furthermore, that experience has to come from people they can identify with. 

As long as this is a hoax to them, all the articles, interviews and best practices sharing won’t make a difference and will build more resistance."

The recommendations from the CDC have fluctuated as it struggled to get a grip in March and April.  The advice has run the gamut; from stay at home and leave masks for the professionals to wear masks at all times when in public.
What this country needs is a good ""Fireside Chat"" from real leaders like Dr. Redfield, Fauci or Adm. Giroir, preferably all three, to set the bar as of July ??, 2020 in simple statements of what Americans must do to protect their families with regular updates through the next three months.
And then we need Americans to do it.  For as long as it takes.  One consistent voice that starts with ""These are our recommendations based upon all we have learned since the pandemic outbreak in February 2020 to today.""  One honest voice is what we need and ALL we wantd."

Then on the right, media focuses on deaths, since deaths are leveling off for now, and may or may not increase soon given the lag time between new cases and deaths. The left and the right avoid numbers on ICU bed capacity.

Obviously if there was anyone with a higher education degree in the adolescent Trump administration they would know that independent research is a major part of the learning process of students working for PhDs and even masters degrees. Independent research supervised by faculty does not occur in a formal classroom. But it does require the doctoral candidate to have access to the information needed for his/her dissertation research.

So, following his lead is akin to a death march. If he says “open up,” then close down. If he tells you the virus is “fading away,” prepare for another wave. If he says that his response has been great, please understand that it has been terrible and continues to be so. He denies science and medicine, but he was chugging down those hydroxychloroquins pretty good for a while. He does not recognize the expertise and experience of Dr. Fauci, but he does believe in Chuck Woolery. He claims that he is not responsible but, and here’s a problem, the president is ultimately responsible for everything associated with this country. Trump doesn’t associate himself with anything that can make him look bad, but that attitude makes him look ...... well, “bad” doesn’t come close to describing how he appears to the world.

California has a huge immigrant population, which unfortunately has a higher rate of health conditions leading to lower immunity.  
We also have locales such as Orange County that resemble places like Florida, where citizens flaunt virus protection as infringing their rights (to get others ill).

There are two considerations. First how do we deal with the spread? Second, how do we keep our economy afloat. You cannot separate these two. Without a vibrant economy, we are as doomed as letting the virus take its course.  Ask anyone who has dealt with a terrible illness like cancer, they still have bills to pay and need money to live. 
Instead of all this judgement and name calling, we need to band together as a nation and figure out how we can get everyone back to work and still offer safety measures. There’s no stopping this virus overnight. It could take years to stop. But we need to live again.

Most were from NJ, based upon their clothing, marked with their school’s logo, team, etc.  After what NJ has been through with this virus, we were in disbelief at the foolishness of these kids. My own kids, 17 and 15, were shocked that in a state that has been ravaged by COVID, young people would so brazenly and arrogantly behave. My daughter, an old soul, asked disgustedly, “ Where are their parents?”.  I hate to politicize my comment but will anyway because that’s my mood at the moment.

It’s a cruel threat of experimentation with children and their families, as well as blatant hypocrisy.  All the twists and turns￼, reversals and gyrations of what administration officials say and do in their various jobs are all attempts to track the stream of consciousness thoughtlessness of their leader, who is mostly ignorant of what his subordinates’ jobs really entail, but who remains fixed on that one goal only of re-election and personal adulation."

No compassion for the dead, the sick, the healthcare workers risking their lives. 

The only federal response has been to funnel trillions of our dollars up to the wealthy (and themselves) and throw $1200 to the serfs. Oh, and they continue trying to strip millions of citizens of their health insurance during a health crisis.

He must stop promoting activities designed to spread the disease and kill Americans -- think MAGA rallies, opening bars, restaurants, and schools, assuming that will help ""his"" employment numbers -- and start working on controlling the virus nationwide and insisting that we all wear masks.  

We need a massive WWII-like national push to produce n95 anti-viral masks for all Americans, quality and consistent tests, a national protocol for testing results and analysis, and stockpiles of PPE for healthcare workers.
  
What he does not seem to understand is that without a national effort to protect everyone (not just himself and his inner circle), this disease is not going anywhere, and business failures and the unemployment numbers are only going to go up.  And it will most likely be even worse come November.

This abrupt change of protocol is also a direct slap in the face to the CDC, questioning their credibility and data.

Besides, according to Pence and his task force, they have ""slowed the spread, flattened the curve, and saved lives.""  Why all of a sudden do they want/need/require hospitals to report virus data directly to them?

But it comes as no surprise the Trump coup would break the law. Ask yourself; why didn't they request to be additional recipients in addition to the C.D.C.? May I suggest the nations hospitals begin sharing depersonalized statistical data with the press? I trust Doctors to help save freedom from the grasp of the Trump coup.
2020-07-14 20:05:27,"""From now on, H.H.S., and not the C.D.C., will collect daily reports about the patients that each hospital is treating, how many beds and ventilators are available, and other information vital to tracking the pandemic.""

How does this sudden order NOT violate my HIPAA Privacy rights?  This rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically.

This order is NOT a good sign and raises some real ethical and legal questions in my mind."

Trump follows the money, he has no loyalty to his workaday base.  Trump's xenophobic policies are largely window dressing to attract a certain element of his base into the voting booth, which they will do.  They will get nothing in return except reductions in the social safety net for themselves....Well, except the farmers, the farmers will get some relief from the disastrous effects of Trump's trade war.  This relief is not as much as the income they would have had without the trade war, and is adding a lot to the national debt their grandchildren will owe.  MAGA indeed."

It’s a small weight off this field’s shoulders to know that these students will be allowed to continue the education that want on their own terms. Lots of questions remain for those who still need to file for a visa or have their visas expiring. 

Shame on the Trump administration for adding more problems to the plates of educators and students, especially now in the face of a growing pandemic. It’s already obvious that education at any level will never be a priority for this country, but it’s even more apparent with policies that hurt people’s access to a given right."

Canadians have been asked to wear masks and social distance whenever we are in enclosed areas such as grocery stores, transit, elevators, most of us have no concerns as we feel it is respectful to our fellow citizens when you come into contact, we have no way of knowing someone's health issues, can we transmit or can they transmit to us, so a mask, hand sanitizer, what's the harm it's not like we would wear one 24hours straight, of course, you will have the defiant ones, everyone has renegades, so

Ex. Russia and the election, Ukraine, Voter suppression to steal votes, Republicans not calling witnesses at impeachment trial. Even Trumps latest move at the Southern District of NY. 

Trump rewards people to make them loyal to him. Mitch McConnell: Supreme Court picks. Republicans: tax cuts. Almost all souls in Congress are for sale at the right price.

Honestly, I am not sure why this administration wants this information anyway because they have no ability to know how to use it, except to manipulate it to create more lies to feed to U.S. citizens and Trump's campaign. This whole thing feels like something Putin or his trickster friend might be instructing Trump to do. Autocracy will reign before November if this keeps up."
2020-07-14 20:04:55,"The politicization of mask wearing stems directly from Trump’s declaration of the Coronavirus as a hoax.

We now have over 136,000 dead Americans and the science tells us that a huge majority of them would still be alive if we would just wear masks.  This is not a problem for seniors who lived through a world war, a depression, civil rights unrest and many other things that required a sense of duty to your neighbor.  We have become so entitled and weak that we fight over everything.  This president is to blame with his you can wear a mask but i won't attitude.   Had he just come out at the beginning and said we are in this together and for the safety of all of us lets wear a mask to slow down the infection but no he made it a political issue.

And remember when he slammed Dr. Bright, the leading vaccine expert, for his testimony about the incompetent HHS response to the pandemic? Then he fired Bright afterwards, on Trump’s orders.

I can think of no more vile corruption of government than the withholding of vital data which might effect healthcare policy that may literally save hundreds of thousands of Americans. There can be no positive purpose for this change in reporting, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 task force's denigration of science to political expediency. This will be a like misfortune.

Five months into the pandemic and we have no sensible federal leadership, no coherent federal reopening guidelines, no significant federal PPE production, no federal PPE procurement initiative so states could save taxpayer dollars.

What we do have is a bullying President who threatens retribution for those with to temerity to choose good governance over his personal political desires. He unfortunately still has a Republican Party cowed to support his valueless ends to the detriment of a hurting nation.

My neighbor has a relative that passed from something other than COVID, but it says COVID on the death certificate.  They are legally trying to have that changed."

It’s so pointless and such a waste - unless the point is to create distraction and chaos to fill news headlines with something other than the failures and malfeasance of the Trump Administration.  

Failing to take strong and immediate action against Russia when there is credible intelligence that Russia has been paying bounties for the murder of American troops in Afghanistan.  Failing to prepare for and effectively deal with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  Trying to dismantle the only healthcare that many Americans rely on.  Failing to provide tax relief for ordinary Americans and instead giving a huge tax windfall to the wealthiest Americans and corporations...  Quick, create a distraction."

And I think that because of the fact that people do not socially distance when they eat out with friends in patios of both bars and restaurants, we really can't allow people to eat out even if it's on the patio because they don't obey the necessary practices to contain this virus.

The problem for Dr. Fauci is that he is not a 'Yes' man. It is best that he retires and preserves his good name, instead of being undermined  day in and day out. In the meantime,  the number of Covid - 19 cases go up and people continue to die."

However, I’ve also long felt uncomfortable about the existing arrangement with international students in the US, where they pay extremely high fees compared to native students. And even after paying that much, many of them will have trouble getting a job and staying here.

I guess if international students and their families deem the education worth it, they should be able to purchase it. But I wish many of them were more well informed about the challenges of staying here. Universities are eager to take their money without telling them the risks."

They planned to just keep charging $50k  a year for online classes.  Trump’s shrewd business decision actually forced them to act because the admins realized that they couldn’t just collect foreign money while delivering close to nothing in return to foreign students.  Was it morally right?  Probably not, but it was certainly informative.

Wealthy immigrant students run America’s top universities."

But when I take my walk around my neighborhood on a weekday, everyone wears masks!  I can only assume that there are suburbanites driving into town who are not willing to adapt to our mask wearing protocols.  Really, what is wrong with these people? 

What's odd about Trump bypassing the CDC is that the CDC is not complaining - the hospitals are saying this isn't right.  If Trump doesn't like the way the CDC is managing the data, then he needs to get people into the CDC who do it better.  Why on earth would you want an agency not set up with proper metrics and flags to evaluate epidemics to handle the data?  The sheer incompetence boggles the mind.  Perhaps changing the head of CDC, who botched the test rollout?  I can imagine that CDC might not project hospital bed shortages, and they think HHS might do it better.

A neutral source must have accurate case and death counts to transmit to all State Governors and Health Departments,  so that a cogent, unified plan can be created in the U.S. to stop the virus.

While Trump denies, and rich company owners and investors demand that ""essential workers"" -- warehouse people, janitors, those in low-paying jobs, AND, teachers, nurses, doctors return to work at risk of death ...

2020-07-15 01:34:05,"Let’s examine the role of government in public health.  Specifically Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ practice of public health.  According to the CDC Foundation, “Public health is the science of IMPROVING AND PROTECTING the health of people and their communities.”

Certainly it’s true that there must be metrics to measure whether improvement is being made or if ground is being lost.  In order to accomplish this there are leading an lagging indicators.

Leading indicators are proactive and predictive.  Measures that indicate the progress being made to reach a goal.  Lagging indicators are measures of where we have been.

In safety, leading indicators measure the things that are done to prevent injury.  For example, the number of gloves issued and the percent of the workforce to whom they were issued. It follows that the greater the number of gloves issued to those likely to suffer a hand injury and the percent of exposed workers to whom they were issued we should expect an improvement in hand safety.

Lagging indicators, tell us how we did.  They either reveal our improvement in safety or our failure.  It is not particularly helpful in measuring the actions we took to improve safety.  It only provides a relative indicator of pass/fail.

With respect to the management of coronavirus, the only reported indicators are lagging.  We talk about the number of tests performed, the number of new cases, the positivity rate and the number of deaths.

Where are our leading indicators?"

The total bungling and lack of leadership during this pandemic has cost people their lives and Trump is responsible. If we had a national effort, we would have this under control. Instead we are in worse shape than we were when the epidemic was was peaking in NY. Not only does he take zero responsibility, but he lies constantly. We will all pay."

And it’s doubtful Congress will match the moment. The federal debt is exploding, and I’m sure Mitch is looking forward to stymying the incoming Democratic administration much as he did in 2009. 

And too many people will have short memories in 2021 and 2022, quickly and conveniently forgetting Trump and expecting Biden to fix everything on a dime. Congress could easily flip back to R in two years and halting all progress.

If we’re lucky the Dems will keep the WH in 2024, but 2028 could be ugly if Washington is mostly gridlocked for eight years. And the R replacement could be Trump on steroids and lots of aggrieved backers.

Watching Trump at Walter Reed Hospital surrounded by military brass and ranking civilians made one think of tin pot dictators who are always surrounded by military brass.

People such as Dr. Fauci, look at the work of US scientists and from those around the world, and then makes his recommendations to our governing authorities. Dr. Fauci's job is to speak the truth, however unpleasant or unwelcome. Lives are at risk. We have to respect our outstanding scientists like Dr Fauci for their dedication to their duties.

Sometimes I wonder if President Trump is purposefully trying to kill Americans, especially people of color (his well known racism) and the elderly (those with decades of wisdom) because he wants to free up Medicare dollars so he and his friends can steal that from our nation as well.

Yet while China and Europe have contained the virus and Vietnam, Taiwan and S Korea warded it off with disciplined behavior, we are still in the throes of infection.  
Trump is singularly responsible for this disastrous debacle - refusing to act on early warnings, unable to organize basic supplies like masks and PPE and testing supplies to fight the virus in the early days and now burying his head in the sand waiting for a miracle to make it go away.

In Jacksonville, Trump still wants to have a no-mask, no-social distance, indoor convention. (However, some delegates are starting to bail out.) The dead Americans could fill the football stadium in Jacksonville three times. Possibly four times by the time of that convention.

What Mr. Trump thinks he's doing is anybody's guess. He certainly couldn't do worse if he were deliberately trying to kill us. One thing is certain. The coronavirus can't be gotten rid of by pretending it doesn't exist. Mr. Trump's lame fantasy response to this very real problem has contributed now to over 135,000 American deaths.

I wish we had an empty chair right now until January.

I think the good doctor is showing how not to react to Trump's aggression and attacks. He continues on using facts and science to present the truth to those who wish to hear it without animosity or rancor but in a straight forward manner.

I am not overly impressed that he met with Meadows, another Republican who must suffer from a diminished capacity, this make nice doesn't change Trump's jealousy and animosity that has been revealed. Trump has to be the assumed smartest person in the room, meaning he those who pose a threat to that and don't agree with him or show him up quickly fall from favor.

The fact is that it's Fauci's job to interpret sets of facts  from the ""very narrow"" point of view of science. It is the president's job to then weigh this interpretation with ""the whole national interest"" (i.e., economic and security policy) in mind.

Fauci has done the job he was hired to do. The president has abandoned the job he was elected to do. I can only hope that before he can fire Fauci, American voters will fire Trump.

As for White House Press Prevaricator Kayleigh McEnany, she should be fired immediately for violations of the Hatch Act, as the self-admitted source of a campaign-style sheet designed to troll Fauci while propping up the reelection campaign of our failed current president."

When people heed you, we are able to keep the coronavirus under control. When they heed the president, they sicken snd die in catastrophic numbers. 

Likewise, hospitals, please continue to send your data to the CDC, regardless of the president’s latest dictum to bypass them. We myst, at all costs prevent the data from being skewed for political purposes. And besides, this murderous, cynical and deeply ignorant man is not the boss of you. 

We are at a crucial turning point, one that will decide the physical and political health of our nation. We must support science and make data driven decisions about how to best fight this disease, and to make that happen, we must make sure that Trump is a one-term president. Our lives depend on it."

There are people who defy the odds and others sucumb when the odds were in their favor. No one is smarter than the virus.

Parents should be cautioned that children will become Trojan horses for the virus, returning home from school with the ability to infect working parents. Instead of blindly reopening all schools at once and placing teachers and administrators in harm's way, try it in small batches and evaluate after 6 and 12 weeks. If teachers and parents don't succumb to the virus, and scans of the asymptomatic children don't show scar tissue on their lungs, then open up a few more regions. Meanwhile, we can work to develop oxygen-powered space helmets for students and teachers to wear so that school environments can be rendered safer."

2020-07-14 14:21:27,"I have a 17 year old grandson who learned absolutely nothing from online home schooling. He’s unhappy, moody, doesn’t have a place, misses friends. 
FaceTime worked to some extent. But that’s old now too. 
He’s lost his way. He should have a little job but nothing is open. He can’t take rode test to drive. 
He’s lost his way educationally. There’s no incentive. There’s a kind of low grade depression. Now summer classes online for those he failed. He might not have been a real scholar without this, but there’s no hope at all now. We’re encouraging a group of children who need motivation and hands on help to flounder. 
Parents feel judged because they are trying to work from hone to earn a living and feel totally inadequate to help their child’s education needs. 
The pressure on the poorly educated to educate their children is enormous. 
Yes, DeVos is right! Somehow, we need to get the children back to school! It’s imperative. 
Thankfully, Trump got many US companies to retool and make masks, ventilators and other PPE. 
Let’s use what we have and find a way back. Washing hands and masks should help at the school level. We must move forward."
2020-07-14 14:04:06,"This could be more personal than political for Trump. He and Melania have a son. He's isolated inside the White House. Being in a classroom come fall, would be best for Barron. Just as Melania kept him in NYC at the beginning of his term, so she could renegotiate the terms of her prenup; just as Trump is said to have paid someone else to take his SAT for him, perhaps opening the schools is really just him using the system to ..."
2020-07-14 14:07:01,"I want to know whether Baron Trump is going back to school and whether everyone around him will be tested.  Also are Ivanka, Eric and his wife and Junior’s former wife are sending their kids to school. The taxpayers will most likely pay a fortune to put all of them in a bubble.  As usual Trump is willing to sacrifice our lives for him, but you know he is not sacrificing anything."
2020-07-14 14:31:19,"Betsy DeVos has been committed to defunding public schools for the past 20 years.  She purchased her cabinet position through campaign donations and retains the title of most unqualified cabinet official - ever.

None of this would be possible without complete republicans senate complicity"
2020-07-14 14:37:38,"DeVos and rest of GOP should put money into the education system to safely open schools! They should have been planning on this issue months ago! Kids should be in school and it needs to be done in a manner to protect kids teachers, other school personal, and their families, as much as possible!"
2020-07-14 14:10:16,"When every public school kid and public school teacher has the same level of protection that BARRON TRUMP has, then they can go back to school.  If public schools are going to be safe, why not send Barron to one this fall?"
2020-07-14 14:29:59,"Re-opening schools has been tried in Australia and things have not gone well.  One of the biggest, individual clusters in the country - 150 people - is at a secondary school that returned students too early.  Even primary schools have been opening, then closing days later, while they track infections.  This is in a country with fewer than 11,000 total cases.

Trump wants to rebuild ""his economy"" on the bodies of children and their parents."
2020-07-14 14:32:00,"Betsy DeVos has only been for parental choice insofar as it serves to funnel tax dollars to private, often parochial, schools. She is using the pandemic to push that mission. 

DeVos' position is that public schools must comply with Trump's order to open fully on site or forfeit federal funds. She wants the money to go to parents to find essentially tax funded schools with no federal oversight. 

DeVos has given no indication of any federal plan or directions for safe compliance, brushing it off as a matter for states and districts to work out. Her scheme has nothing to do with child welfare or education.  She is following the Republican pandemic playbook - take tax dollars for GOP priorities and push federal responsibilities onto the states."
2020-07-14 14:36:43,"If schools open, the virus will become worse. Had we taken steps to contain and trace the virus early , we could safely open schools like what is going on in New Zealand and Taiwan. We now have the highest infection rates and deaths in the world. Keeping the schools closed and having remote learning is the only viable, safe option now.  Next year, with monoclonal antibody therapy and multiple vaccines, the pandemic will be behind us and schools can safely reopen."
2020-07-14 14:36:55,"The solution is simple. Double the funding so that a second shift of teachers can be hired, and have half of each class attend in the morning to mid afternoon while the other half attends with a different teacher from mid afternoon to evening. The schools are just sitting empty and unused at this time anyway. This provides the distancing that will be required — along with the precautionary masks and hand gel. Doesn’t take much to solve the problem."
2020-07-14 14:36:14,"What  I see at play is DeVos parroting Trump's message for probably these two reasons, if not more. 

First, who isn't aware of the administration's attempted hatchet job on Dr. Fauci's credibility for stating facts and honest information. For them to state that he has been wrong often times in the past is almost laughable when comparing his intel with what Trump has and continues to claim. So, if DeVos goes off the grid, no doubt ridicule and personal attacks will follow. 

Second, she wants to hold on to her position. The quickest way to be shown the White House back door is to publicly disagree with Trump, especially so close to the presidential election. She may not be the brightest bulb on the holiday tree, but she knows enough to quickly and suddenly shift gears and endorse exactly what Trump said and continues to say. 

What a scary and horrible way to run a government, much less the education department - folks being more afraid of Trump than they are of being honest."
2020-07-14 14:34:57,"The Secretary of Education offers neither a method nor money to support this madness. Opening schools without basic precautions to stop virus transmission—such as better ventilation or outdoor learning—will simply spread illness to both teachers and students. Consider November without teachers available for either online or in-person instruction, and perhaps an entire school year lost to a reckless return to classrooms. The economic consequence would be far worse than what we have already seen."
2020-07-14 14:27:31,"So, what is the reopening plan for St. Andrews Episcopal School, Potomac? What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?"
2020-07-14 14:44:32,This reminds me of the mayor who opened the beaches in the movie Jaws.
2020-07-14 14:45:04,DeVos is not really worth the ink spilled on this issue. Trump trots out his backbenchers whenever he wants to put out a message but pretend it is not written by him. We have government by one hopelessly incompetent man.
2020-07-14 14:46:01,"Betsy DeVos is committed to parrot Trump, who has no principles, and has decided to ignore and belittle all the advice of our health experts."
2020-07-14 14:49:52,Is anyone surprised that Secretary DeVos has developed a strong liking for authoritarianism?
2020-07-14 14:44:39,Maybe she has tendered Amway to provide all the products to clean schools across America.
2020-07-14 14:44:40,"Watching her CNN interview for 30-seconds was sufficient to unequivocally demonstrate DuVos has absolutely no idea what she’s talking about. There’s no plan for the country, why should schools be different?"
2020-07-14 14:40:53,The idea that *anyone* in the Trump “administration” cares about the well-being of children can only be considered risible.
2020-07-14 14:42:45,"Rarely have I witnessed a cabinet secretary so out of their depth.
Devos is arguably the most inept Cabinet Secretary on record.
And that's par for an administration that is the most incompetent in American history.

Her interview on CNN this past Sunday was shocking.
She is woefully equipped to lead the Education Department.
Just like he boss."
2020-07-14 14:43:52,"Well, this is what we get when we hire Republicans, folks: captive agencies. Education, Treasury, Justice, State, Labor, Transportation, EPA, Interior...the corruption is right down the line.

Big mess to clean up starting Jan. 21."
2020-07-14 14:48:42,"Thank god I don't have to make this choice but given the true lack of respect and pay teachers are given.  Frankly I'd go do anything else for a job, than be stuck in a tiny room with 30 kids with poor ventilation come flu season adding a respiratory infection running unchecked through the country.  Nope any other job would do.  Sorry teachers I really feel for you but take care of yourselves first because the fact that your safety and the students safety has become a political gambit says that we aren't capable yet of addressing the severity of this issue.  DeVos is less than helpful or caring.   May the odds be ever in your favor."
2020-07-14 14:47:45,"Every loyal lieutenant in the Trump administration is an unreliable and unsafe influence in our country's response to the pandemic. They are getting people killed.

State and local officials should not cave to Trump's demands. He's trying to win reelection, not address the pandemic.

Voters will remember which government officials worked to protect them and which put their lives in greater danger."
2020-07-14 14:48:43,"It is obvious that Trump is pushing the back to school issue to bolster his re-election. He has no problem with putting our children in harm's way as long as he perceives a benefit to him.   He sees the virus only as a threat to his presidency and not a threat to the health and welfare of people.

The results of his self-serving actions of ignoring the reality of the dangers of a pandemic vs how it affects him personally are evident in states that have chosen to follow him vs following our experts.

We can not allow Trump to bully us into putting our children back in schools that are in fact a danger to the children and the teachers. If we allow this, we will be less of an individual than Donald is, because we know better.

Our children trust us to keep them safe, do not let them down."
2020-07-14 14:49:04,"Does Ms. DeVos' demand that ALL schools be open for on-site classes include the religious schools and charter schools she wants to fund with federal tax dollars? She and Trump have threatened to withhold federal funding, which I understand they don't have the authority to do. I am just wondering if DeVos thinks her threat will somehow benefit her push to replace public education with more of her underperforming charter schools."
2020-07-14 14:45:13,"Betsy and Donnie are working in an unrealistic environment with daily virus testing and immediate quarantine of colleagues or secret service persons who test positive. No school can possibly duplicate that level of security for students, teachers, administrators, lunch ladies, bus drivers, or coaches for sports teams.

Children and school personnel will sicken and some will die. Who will lead the handwringing, Betsy? Who will take responsibility, Donnie?"
2020-07-14 14:48:09,the second best reason ( at least in the top five) to get rid of trump. it will be nice to have as a Secretary of Education someone who cares about education s well as our children.
2020-07-14 14:58:00,"To be clear: what happened in the spring was not online teaching - online teaching requires planning and resources. For most of us teaching in the spring was a patchwork of what we knew we could do given our teaching lives shifted dramatically overnight. There was no plan then, just as there is no plan now. The administration should have used the three months people everywhere spent inside to develop a plan than negotiated the ideal with the reality, but I see no evidence of such a plan. 

And here we are, in the beginnings of a new academic year, still without a plan grounded in reality that ensures the safety of children and the adults who work within these schools, not to mention the family members students, teachers, and staff interact with outside of the school building. I’m beyond sad DeVos failed to rise to this challenge, but not surprised."
2020-07-14 14:56:08,"Betsy DeVos again shows that she has no sense, no knowledge of the truth on the ground, and no compassion. Now she is demonstrating to us that she has no firm convictions.   She's just the next schill being used by DJT to promote his re-election by pretending that everything is ok, and hoping that we all believe it.   DJT has a habit of axing his minions, and while I don't generally get any satisfaction from that, I will if he tosses DeVos under the bus.

I love the quote ""I wouldn’t trust you to care for a house plant, let alone my child.”       And Rep. Pressley is correct, they would rather see us dead, than them financially harmed or out of office."
2020-07-14 14:58:52,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is detrimental to the education of all American children. Ms. DeVos proves that she is unqualified to be our Secretary of Education every time she opens her mouth in social media interviews. She couldn't be a more untrustworthy member of this president's Cabinet during the Covid-19 Pandemic and our Presidential Election this year. If schools open throughout America in a few months, Ms. DeVos and our president will be responsible for giving our children as hostages to the virus. These colossally unfit leaders are putting our children at risk. The Coronavirus pandemic is being spread throughout America by the irresponsible reopening of our cities and states."
2020-07-14 13:58:26,So unfortunate that a person with no qualifications is responsible for the education of children in America.   Look to Michigan for the legacy of DeVos and charter schools.
2020-07-14 14:44:30,"""I wouldn’t trust you to care for a house plant, let alone my child."" 
- Rep. Ayanna Pressley

What else needs to be said?"
2020-07-14 14:47:26,I hope Ms. DeVos understands the depth of the hole she it digging for herself.  Her unethical and possibly illegal actions to date will have consequences for her down the line.  Hopefully they will be very expensive consequences.
2020-07-14 14:56:19,This women has zero business in government. She has zero business being the secretary of education.  Newspapers need to stop pretending that this administration is anything but a farce.
2020-07-14 14:57:48,"Schools run by fools?  With the Trump Administration that is a no-brainer!  Not content with ruining our current economy and society, he appoints an unqualified heiress/political donor to run our national education policy.  What a way to make America great again!"
2020-07-14 14:25:47,"Betsy represents the arrogance and stupidity of the moneyed class in America. It was Balzac who said (among other things) that behind every great fortune there lies a great crime. Her ""clan"" is a prime example of this. 

All she is capable of is barking orders with the expectation that the peasants will obey. No thought, no plan, just do it!

Reminds me of someone else."
2020-07-14 14:57:45,"Check DeVos’ credentials. NOTHING qualifies her for her current position. I saw her double-talking, stone-walling, fake-smiling interview on CNN. NOT ONCE did she address the HEALTH of students, teachers, and all those who support the education process. Another disgusting, rich beyond belief Trump toady. And in all this time her department has obviously not been working, since she offers NO PLAN to assist school districts. VOTE!"
2020-07-14 14:51:20,"I don't understand this logic.

There is a deadly pandemic that is killing people.  If kids go to school they can get the disease easily and transmit it to their parents, who may need to go to the hospital and could potentially die.

Who is going to take care of those kids? Jared Kushner? Melania Trump?

A study from Europe showed that about .7% of children who get the disease die. there are 75 million kids under the age of 18 in this country.  If even just 12% get the disease (a rate found in NY) from opening schools that is 9 million kids, of which 63,000 will die.  

63,000 dead children (not a scientific estimate, based on current data) seems to acceptable to the Trump administration.  The fact that any amount of kids dying is acceptable is just horrific.

What in the world is going on."
2020-07-14 14:57:57,"Is Trump sending his son Barron to school and are his grandchildren all going back in person, full time non- blended learning model?"
2020-07-14 14:52:41,Before we can talk about opening schools to children full time the federal government needs to create a plan to PAY FOR IT.
2020-07-14 14:53:21,I say laptops and WiFi for all our youth now! Let’s get them ready for distance learning!!!
2020-07-14 14:53:24,"So, for Ms DeVos, ""classrooms are the best environment for them."" 

What is the best environment for getting them to and from school? People throughout the nation came to the conclusion that cruise ships weren't the best environment for them. Our airlines are now sanitizing their aircraft cabins and touting their air refreshing systems in an effort to get flying again. Are you proposing school districts do that with buses too? 

Given your background of incredible wealth (ditto for Trump), I doubt that either of you have ever been on a full school bus with kids of all ages and with windows up. So, until you address the issue of school bus safety in the same sentence as school classroom safety, you haven't done your job."
2020-07-14 14:54:08,"Make no mistake. This approach is a wedge hoping parents who can afford to do so will withdraw their children from public schools and enroll them in private schools permitting a more cautious approach with partial or complete ""home schooling"" either directly or via internet classes. I don't believe for a moment DeVos has abandoned her goal. She and Trump have simply found a way to accelerate it while also trying to make things appear normal in time for the election. Why let a good pandemic go to waste."
2020-07-14 15:01:50,"DeVos likely wants classrooms to open due to her profit motive in the private schools her family backs. DeVos has and always has had a conflict of interest in education, and should not be the Secretary of Education.  That profit motive and conflict of interest must be kept in mind when considering her recommendations."
2020-07-14 15:03:24,"Vouchers for private academies and religious schools.  Bust the unions.  More for the rich, less for the poor. Classroom prayers and Christmas pageants in public schools.  Less waste of money on Democratic Union teachers. Let the halt, the lame, the abused, and the weak of mind sink or swim as they will have to in our sterling market economy.
Religion is real; germs are a hoax. Privatize and monetize everything possible.

Schools are only for babysitting while the parents go to work to benefit their employers. So what if they’re Petri dishes?

It’s a strong, pro-America plan and we’re sticking to it.

This week."
2020-07-14 14:57:30,"A couple of years ago, I listened to an NPR interview with Arne Duncan (Obama's Secy. of Education), whose actions as Secy. had been praised by Republicans such as Jeb Bush, Chris Christi, and Lamar Alexander.

Duncan was flabbergasted that DeVos had made no attempt to reach out to previous Secy's - some of whom, even from the Bush administration, were willing and eager to provide DeVos with insight into the job and its challenges.

Perhaps most telling is that when asked what Duncan thought of DeVos's goals and plans for the Department, he responded that there were no goals or plans. The implication was that DeVos was over her head, had little idea of what to do, and had received the appointment simply because she contributed lots of money to Trump's campaign."
2020-07-14 15:05:26,"As a teacher of young children, it is obvious to me, Betsy DeVos has no business being the secretary of education. There is no way to have 25-30 children in a classroom safely. When I taught sixth grade, the students couldn’t move between desks without knocking another student’s backpack off their chair. How are students to social distance in this kind of environment?"
2020-07-14 14:51:14,"Note well if you have school age children and also live in a bottom 90% American household: It is time to prepare your Plan B, and maybe even Place C.

With you or without you, and regardless of what your state and local public education decision makers decide about teaching this coming year’s school curriculum; the power elite class is already planning how to take care of their own children’s education. By way of home schooling, private tudors, private schooling, Co-op learning consortiums, or use of alternative teaching resources, the kids of the wealthy will be moving forward.

Do not allow your own child to be left behind. Otherwise, good luck!"
2020-07-14 15:08:40,"The Republican Party was the first  to condemn the cabinet status of the Education Department. Now its leader has the department telling the nation's school districts what it must do. I liked the old Republican Party that  had a consistent view of the relationship of federal and state governments. Now, under Trump....one day it's the state's obligation, and the next the federal government's."
2020-07-14 15:11:46,"This is similar to what we Boomers once read about the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China: there can be discussion and local experimentation unless and until the central government decides on a national plan from which there shall be no deviation. It is a feature in states controlled by a highly ideological Republican party. They believe in local control as long as independently governed state agencies, school districts, counties, or cities don’t stray from party approved philosophies."
2020-07-14 15:14:44,"There was a reason that Mike Pence had to be the tie breaker in her jaw-dropping confirmation hearing.

When ideologues govern without expertise the result is the runaway train wreck that is the United States of America in July 2020.
Ms DeVos should never have been allowed within a 1000 miles of the Department of Education to begin with.   
She is a dilettante billionaire by birth and marriage (and future poster child for increasing the estate tax), who campaign contributions paved the way for her to inject her radical religious ideology into the schools of our nation.
A ""Confederacy of Dunces"" doesn't come close to describing the Department of Education, or for that matter, the entire Federal government under this administration....we've entered the area of criminally negligent homicide."

Gotta have a good economy, open up!  Gotta have kids in school!  It’s ALL optics. And people are suffering and dying as a result.  This is sociopathy"
2020-07-14 15:19:09,But this is part of her master plan to divert money from public schools (if they don’t reopen) to private charter schools. She’s using the pandemic to further her agenda.
2020-07-14 15:10:00,"How about we allow schools to reopen in those states where the Republicans believe this virus is still a non-issue or that the lives of their teachers and children are worth sacrificing for the ""good of the economy""; the rest of the country can see how it goes the first month and then make a decision from there! Or better yet, how about a test run in a school that DeVos' grandchildren might attend? Oh - wait - her own kids never went to public school so I'm guessing her grandchildren don't either. So typical of the elite."
2020-07-14 15:11:16,"Republicans want to privatize everything. If they could, they'd sell you the air you breathe. Since they can't outright privatize core government services, they defund them and put them under administrators who run them into the ground. So that in your frustration with government you will beg for privatization. This is not the failure of government, but the triumph of those who hate government.

DeVos' only interest in school choice is to use it to dismantle public education and funnel tax dollars to private schools with no federal oversight. So she wants to force unsafe full on site opening as a way of forcing districts to ope unsafely or forfeit funding. Double win for the GOP. Total loss for public education."
2020-07-14 15:18:52,"Her plan is just to follow Trump in saying to open everything and let’s see what happens. This is a bad experiment for our kids. There is no plan, no money to help. Nothing. It’s another egregious failure. The lid is being ripped off to show the sad underbelly of our nation’s education system run by a woman who has no right to be in the position she is in. 
This is so disturbing on many levels."
2020-07-14 15:13:53,"“the department can revoke federal funding if districts do not meet their states’ minimum hours of instruction or fulfill the requirements of federal special education and civil rights laws.”

Well maybe the public school system should organize to call their asinine bluff.  What is more a civil right than protection from  exposure to a deadly viral pandemic?  

To allow Trump and by extension, DeVos to hold forth their “expert” positions on this issue, which seem to be reopen and take the risk when they have offered nothing rational as to how to do it is journalistic malpractice.  Fortunately, many journalists are challenging them.

If it’s ok for our children, teachers and support staff to go back, why are CEO’s planning to continue to work from home for the foreseeable future?"
2020-07-14 15:17:23,I know what I would like to tell DeVos and trump but it wouldn't be PC. There is no way I would let a child of mine back into a classroom until there is an effective vaccine.

2020-07-14 15:06:44,"Another example of the incompetence and agenda ridden trump administration. Millions of Americans were lined up at food banks, grocery shelves empty, while farmers crops were rotting in their fields. Meanwhile for months no action by the commerce secretary or the secretary of transportation and not any actions at all from  the agricultural commissioner until July. It's been almost five months since schools were closed due to the pandemic. Except for making it harder for students who are in debt due to charlatans who were allowed to open ""trump"" like universities to get loan forgiveness, you've done NOTHING regarding helping cities, counties and state plan for safe an effective school openings, in this regard you have been totally absent. You have not sent teams of your staff to visit schools and make plans according to space constraints. Your too busy pushing your right wing religious agenda along with whatever policies fit into trump's alternate reality of the week. You have been completely ignoring all else that's important and crucial for our children's education and their safety."
2020-07-14 15:07:19,Maybe she could do some teacher substitute work for a week or two in an inner city public school since she sees no risk involved for school staff or students when schools open this fall.

And now they all have that dumbfounded look on their faces as they realize that the only folks voting for them were racists, plutocrats, and those too dumb to know it."
2020-07-14 15:14:05,"Just like the Trump rally in Tulsa, don't be surprised if the Trump administration forces children heading back to school to sign waivers saying it won't be responsible if your child gets COVID in class!"
2020-07-14 15:20:59,"This is probably stating the obvious, but Ms. DeVos has never really been an advocate for local control. She has always been an advocate for pulling children out of public schools and putting them into either ideologically driven or for-profit schools."
2020-07-14 15:21:15,"Why don’t they just call it like it is? They want “free” (or already paid by local taxpayers) child care so parents “will” go back to work and life “will” go back to normal. And if they further hurt the public education system by destabilizing, dividing and draining it? Collateral damage."
2020-07-14 15:21:05,"Honestly, aside from being mindlessly callous, Betsy DeVos's biggest flaw seems to be that she is simply not very intelligent. She is representative of the average Trump appointee - money, truckloads of it, but no other real qualification to do anything. She's in over her head the second she steps out the door in the morning. But it doesn't matter, because in the world Trump has created only money really matters."
2020-07-14 15:52:33,"Info on Swedish schools-apples and oranges from the US:
""School principals have been given increased decision-making powers so that they can introduce measures relating to the outbreak, including deciding to close the school or change how teaching is carried out, such as by adjusting the timetable.

For example, it's possible for a school to limit the number of students in school by only allowing in students with special needs, those who have exams at the end of the year which will impact their future education or career, and/or those with a vulnerable home environment. Or teachers may be allowed to conduct their lessons online, or at different times from usual.

Sweden has fast-tracked legislation that enables municipalities to offer childcare for parents in essential jobs, such as healthcare and welfare, if schools do end up having to close. This was not previously possible, because Swedish law states that everyone must be treated equally."""
2020-07-14 15:50:58,"Public schools are funded mostly by local property taxes, so the threat of withholding federal funds is not that fearsome.  Moreover, the decision of whether to resume in-person classes depends on the extent of the pandemic in the particular locality.  Some counties near me in Southern Illinois have had a total of ONE case of coronavirus.  There's no reason they can't resume classes.  But Houston or Phoenix are another matter."
2020-07-14 15:46:03,"I applauded DeVos vigorously when the DOE changed the guidelines for sexual assault on college campuses.  Obama had essentially stripped men of all their due process rights, set up a parallel system of justice which satisfied no one, and wasted money on more administrators when we have a criminal justice system that isn't perfect but clearly superior to college monkey courts.

But as a pediatrician I must say this effort to open our schools in the face of the largest wave of new infections ever seen anywhere is insanely stupid.

Children do get COVID19.  The children's hospital I use has seen roughly 500 ER cases since March.  We haven't seen 500 cases of any single diagnosis in 3 months ever.  Overall, about 2% of COVID19 cases are in children, that's 34,000 sick kids so far. They rarely die but they do end up in the ICU and with permanent disabilities. 

What possible justification could there be in increasing this risk? We can't think of a better way to improve the economy?

Then they spread it to adults. Israel was down to less than 10 cases a day before they opened their schools.  Now they're averaging about 1300 cases a day.  Their CDC head equivalent resigned.  She said the reopening of schools was the reason for undoing everything their society had accomplished.

I'm aware Maryland, LA, and San Diego have all said next year school will be virtual. Good judgment!

Virtual schooling isn't perfect but it's temporary.  Sickness, death, and disability are permanent."

2020-07-14 15:48:50,“Let the people die” should be the official motto of Trump. He is trying to distract from his abysmal handling of coronavirus by talking about school openings. We needed FDR to rally the American people to work together like in WW2. Instead we got Trump who thinks opening schools and murdering kids will help his re-election chances.

2020-07-14 15:36:18,Secretary DeVos is an embarrassment to the education profession. She simply champions elitist values and solutions that continue to benefit the privileged few rather than improve education for the rest of our students across our country. How unfortunate that she cannot be impeached.
2020-07-14 15:51:46,"If you tell most parents that opening schools will help reelect Trump, they will keep schools closed, figuring that a few months more of lost schooling for their children is a fair price to pay for getting rid of this president, who is mismanaging a pandemic, killing thousands unnecessarily, and wanting to kill thousands more by opening schools prematurely. On an objective plane, anyway, we all know the science: first you curb the pandemic, then you reopen. And do it by stages. And have testing and tracing. Ms. DeVos has no shame."
2020-07-14 15:52:21,"It’s too late now for in-person schooling.

Compare the low flatlines in those countries that crushed the curve before planning and provisioning well to open schools - like Taiwan, New Zealand, Germany, Scotland, Denmark, Norway (all led by women, surprise-surprise), S.Korea, or Australia. And add to that the emerging data that covid19 also can cause serious cardiovascular and “PMIS”, serious neurological harm to children.

In our Orwellian universe, with DeVos gaslighting in interviews that children do not face any harm, opening in-person schools is another spin of the russian roulette chamber, having already spun over the cliff in FL, AZ, TX and many other states. 

This time she’s playing with the lives of American children."
2020-07-14 15:30:57,"Does anyone else find it astounding that when trump ordered kids back to school, he also said if if states don't do so he would remove funding? Oh and "" I have the power to do that"" was stated twice.Is this his putin impersonation? Never mind he does NOT have that power. Devoss is now exposed as the fraud she's always been. Compromised her beliefs to suit the king trump. All of this is heart breaking and not at all helpful to the people. I pray we get through this to January."
2020-07-14 15:35:48,I wonder if Trump and DeVos have compared notes yet on the cost of hiring stand-in SAT takers.  It's possible she's missed this potential profit center in the education system.
2020-07-14 15:45:25,"The rational of Trump's transformation of DeVos as the new poster child for advocating a return to the classroom it easy to discern. He needs a scapegoat he can point to and blame in order to help his re-election. DeVos won't last much past September 15th. American parents and teachers are not going to take the bait, the children and our teachers are far too precious to send them into harms way. 

I am reminded of the Sting song ""Russians"": 

In Europe and America
There’s a growing feeling of hysteria
Conditioned to respond to all the threats
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets
Mr. Khrushchev said we will bury you
I don’t subscribe to this point of view
It would be such an ignorant thing to do
If the Russians love their children too

Substitute a new names and you pretty much have the situation."
2020-07-14 15:55:26,"Betsy DeVos is hardly the only conservative who can turn on a dime when she is placed in a position of authority. The governors of Texas, Arizona, and Georgia parted ways with their 'small government' mantra to force re-opening of their states by stripping cities of local mandates. They all honor their commitment to local control only by insisting on locals' responsibility to carry out whatever misguided mandates they choose to impose."
2020-07-14 15:26:06,"Two years ago, I read on a NYT comments board a somber prediction in response to an article about good economic numbers (jobs, I believe).  Plenty of Trump supporters were using the opportunity to gloat about his leadership, but one response to their comments struck me.

(Paraphrasing)
""Soon Trump will have to deal with a crisis, as all Presidents do.  We will then see if he is a leader or not.""

Anyone who has a child knows that kids get sick at school all the time.  Even if it is mild in children, this disease is deadly to adults (and especially families with a grandparent in the house).

Just as North Korea tells its citizens that there is plenty of food on the shelves and that it's worse everywhere else, Trump is desperately trying to make it seem like things aren't that bad here by ""opening the country"" and ""rocking and rolling by July"".

He finally had to deal with a crisis, and he failed as a leader. There is no Democrat to bash, no critic to silence.  He tried his go-to tactic of name calling... ""the Kung-flu"" but even that didn't make it go away.

There is simply nothing in his playbook to dig himself out of this hole, so he digs deeper.  Pandemic or not, suppression or not, voting by mail or not, there will be a historical turnout in November.  People are tired of death, tired of lies, tired of fear.  Unfortunately January of 2021 won't come soon enough for some, but there is hope."
2020-07-14 15:28:59,"""[A]nd that’s having their schools and all the services they provide fully operational in the fall."" Who is paying for this? The states and localities are now cash strapped and looking at budget shortfalls that will impact police, fire, and education. Guess which public service is expendable? And guess who within that service is the most expendable? The teachers, of course. Not the administrators, the frontline teachers, janitors, bus drivers, secretaries, all the folks who actually make education happen. Should schools not reopen and Congress (with, of course, McConnell's blessing) chooses to not bail out the states and cuts education funding, the students most impacted by cuts in federal funding will be the special education and special needs students (elements of their education are mandated by NCLB and the IDEA educational acts).

Once again, the white and the wealthy will be minimally impacted."
2020-07-14 15:32:25,"Surely a fundamental duty of every government is the protection of the lives and welfare of its citizens.  And among those citizens, none are more important to the future than children.

It is a sign of the absolute moral bankruptcy of this hideous administration that it is willing to sacrifice our nations children on the altar of political power.

And to do so, as Ms. DeVos so often does, in the name of “Christian” morality is an outrage to the faith of the gospel.

Jesus said, as you do to the least of these children you do to me.

Sending kids back into the teeth of a pandemic in order to gain votes is a direct contradiction of the Christian gospel.  

If Trumps religious supporters do not see that now, they will never see it.  Blind, they will follow the blind, and it is fervently to be hoped they will follow him to utter defeat."
2020-07-14 15:35:15,"Betsy DeVos is just plain awful in her total capitulation to  Trump in his ""reckless endangerment"" of the nation's school children, their teachers, administrative personnel, and, of course, their parents. In the delusional world of  mentally ill (according to his niece, a Ph.D. in clinical psychology) Trump somehow believes this will allow/force parents back to work and magically lift the economy along with Trump's fading hopes for reelection. But, as Trump's campaign to ""LIBERATE"" states into prematurely reopening for business without satisfying even the C.D.C. guidelines he weakened has revealed, recklessness has resulted in wreckage as coronavirus cases have soared and death rates are following. Now even some of the most rabid of his Southern red state governors have been forced to reverse course with the notable exception of Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida which has become the new Italy or New York City of the Covid-19 virus catastrophe that Trump and he are perpetrating. Fortunately, DeVos' hypocritical and callous jawboning has had little effect as many local school districts are taking a much more cautious approach in the face of an out of control epidemic."
2020-07-14 15:45:34,"While it obvious that Trump only cares about the stock market and reelection, don't they understand
Dead Americans = Bad for reelection
Saving lives= Good for reelection 

As far as the economy is concerned Trump's actions and inactions are much worse for the economy and will be much more costly  to the economy than implementing a strict plan to save lives. 

Other countries can safely open schools because c-19 is under control there. USA is a mess with little hope that this will end soon. 

DeVos like Trump have no concern for the lives of the people they are employed to protect. It is getting very depressing listening to these people talk complete nonsense and continue to take no action, or develop a plan based on science and the current facts."
2020-07-14 16:09:51,"It is natural for parents to do sacrifices towards the education of their kids. 

The idea that the education of our kids should be sacrificed to minimize health risks is odd, possibly only justified by the fact that politicians and rich parents are older than ever. 

Continuing with online classes will only delay the learning kids further. It will also widen the gap between kids of wealthy educated families like ours, and kids from less educated families, with parents who work multiple jobs and have less time and skills to provide the education that school districts are mandated to provide.

Please bring the kids back to school, full time. Kids risk nothing from COViD, play little or no role in COViD transmission, and they need social interaction and classroom teaching.

I completely agree with the idea of protecting older or at-risk teachers, and parents in the same situation. Let the younger, healthier teachers teach. I am happy to host one or two friends of my kids for a few months, to protect their at-risk parents. 

But certainly keeping the kids from learning is not a proportionate answer.

I think this position is based on the assumption that health risks should be minimized at all costs. Mine is based on the assumption that human beings are not just living organisms, that they have multiple needs, and that younger generations should not pay an extreme price for a hypothetical small gain to older generations or at-risk individuals."

2020-07-14 16:44:29,"Trump recently threatened to refuse to fund the US military—wrap your head around that!—if bases named for confederates had their names changed. Now he threatens to deny funding to schools, never mind their crushing need for funds in an economic crisis during a pandemic. No help with safety measures, no more room or teachers or PPE. No plans for opening, no plan for when the dying starts. And he’ll defund them as utterly as he can unless they’re fully open and full. In a raging pandemic. He says he will destroy our institutions unless his horrible, destructive orders are obeyed. Repeatedly. And he’s destroyed so much and so many already. How can this go on?"

2020-07-14 16:04:24,Maybe as a pilot program DeVos could ask her private but publicly funded favorite schools to open first? They could spend the government moneys not made available to the public schools to prepare for COVID and serve as guinea pigs to see what precautions are essential. Especially as DeVos believed the CDC requirements are only suggestions.
2020-07-14 16:20:13,"The lack of one iota of planning for this eventuality by the Trump administration is appalling. I guess when you believe this will 'all just go away'; planning for a safe reopening of schools takes the present form: none. How the government can give Billions to the Catholic church and zero to school districts is unconscionable. Where are the Hepa filters? where are the barriers? The wipes? The sanitation supplies? 
I have a good friend who is the 1 and only custodial handyman for a local school district of 8 high schools and 15 middle schools, they don't have anything in place. This is more wishful thinking by the Trump administration and they are gambling with the lives of our children."
2020-07-14 16:31:34,"It’s laughable if not tragically evident what DeVos is about and goes unrecognized here. This is not about a sudden reversal from disdain for federal mandate vs state independent right to choose policy or political partisan alliance for that matter. What it is, is demonstration of elitist thinking. Public school
education for DeVos and the Trump administration is categorized as education for the marginalized and deprived Americans. Those children whose parents lack the financial affluence to pay for private school tuition. It’s been reported that DeVos has donated money to a conservative think tank/lobby group, the Acton Committee, who promotes lessening regulations on child labor laws. As they see it, not all children for various reasons can benefit from education. These children can better serve both themselves and society by entering the workforce. Here we have it America. The mindset of America’s Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. For shame."
2020-07-14 16:31:47,"While other countries come up with new ways of online instruction, Betsy DeVos, like Donald Trump, wants your children to attend school in spite of the fact coronavirus numbers are rising exponentially. Sound like a good idea? 

Just what we've come to expect from an administration with it's head in the sand, or up in the clouds, but never facing the pandemic problem square on. 

I long for the day we see the backs of this handpicked group of Republican toadies only too willing to be the fancy-dressed mouthpieces for policy mired in murk."

But you have to listen to what the doctors say about preventing infectious spread too. You cannot cherry-pick. Yes all the testing and protective equipment and extra staff will be expensive. If you have a Trillion for your rich buddies, you can find a Trillion for America's kids. (Why not pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan, use the savings for schools?!)"

Don’t please believe Betsy DeVos. Online education is phenomenal. Teacher’s will absolutely enjoy disseminating academics to children. Kids who can learn will enjoy this medium and the freedom it affords. If made very interesting, I am sure we can slowly but surely fascinate those kids who don’t normally like sitting down in class rooms to learn. We must try to evolve and move forward with time."

TALK for six hours?  Talking spreads the disease. I teach writing. I think having them write to me on line is just great pedagogy.

Answer these questions, Mrs. DeVos—
If a teacher tests positive for Corona, are they required to quarantine for 2-3 weeks?  Who will be their substitute teachers? Should subs all be tested before beginning? How often? Will those substitutes work in multiple schools?  What if the substitute tests positive? Or anyone in a house with teachers or with students? And if a teacher has five classes a day with 20-30 students in each, will those 100-150 students also be required to quarantine?  And how will they make up their work, each one of them, especially if some of them have siblings in school who will also need to quarantine, and perhaps family members who will also need to?

When the first teacher dies, how will that death affect the students, the school, the community?

But merely because she is a proponent of local control of education, that does not mean she cannot or should not urge on the federal level the basic notion that schools should reopen. Indeed, those who criticize her for espousing this position of the Department of Education would, in most other cases, urge the broadest federalization of all aspects of education."

Through that lens DeVos' actions may appear inconsistent and confusing. But I don't think DeVos is caving to Trump and I don't think she's flipflopped. As others here have pointed out, DeVos has fought consistently to privatize education. In a recent interview on Fox, DeVos said: ""Look, American investment in education is a promise to students and their families. If schools aren't going to reopen and not fulfill that promise, they shouldn't get the funds, and give it to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise.” (SOURCES: Heather Cox Richardson, Letters from an American, 7/12/20 and William Cummings, USA Today, 7/12/20) . . .

He expects people to admire him, his wealth. He makes me want to vomit. You?

Now having said all of that, here's the real jaw dropping, head scratching, fear inducing observation. There are many people that think she's smart, talented and oh yes, rich. In the imaginary society that Americans pretend to live in, she's a success and a mover, shaker. Sure thing, and 40% percent of Americans are illiterate.

Perhaps satisfying the Russian tool's needs is not a legal mandate, but to threaten funding that goes to school meals, special education services and Magnet programs is as close to a ""mandate"" as a criminal enterprise like this death cult can get.  Technically, it's called extortion: ""give us your children, their health, the health of you and your community and we'll give you some money.""  If you or your children don't survive, oh well.  Money saved.     

I'd like to see some credentials that back up this claim that this branch of the trump re-election campaign knows “what’s best for kids.""  Who in that department has worked in public education before?  Who has experience in pre-K through 12 education? In working with impoverished populations?  Because that wretched, immoral woman went to the best private schools money can buy does not make her qualified."

That going to an actual school building is best for kids” is not exactly a controversial statement. That sending kids and teachers into schools during a raging pandemic with no plan, assurance that folks will get sick die as a result, and against the better wishes of the CDC and a lot of doctors is another kind of statement altogether. And it doesn’t carry much weight coming from someone with no training in education or public health who has spent her life disempowering public schools and diverting resources to private and religious schools."

However next week the CDC is releasing information that would help parent make more sense of this dilemma. According to NYT/AP 7/9/20 'CDC Head Sticking to School-Opening Guidelines Trump Criticized' there is a 30 question parent check-list: 

The 30-question parent checklist asks about a child’s health, use of special education services, comfort with local school plans and whether parents can facilitate at-home learning. It warns that if parents check multiple items on the “stay-at-home” column, that “could be an indicator that your family should consider alternative learning formats other than in-person schooling.”

Parents need that CDC check-list before being asked to decide on their children's education and health risks. 

I have confidence that educators will prioritize CDC guidance during a pandemic but I don't have confidence that necessary information for educators will come through if that conflicts with what the Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has promoted.

Hopefully Congress and/or the judicial system can protect schools from Betsy DeVos' threat to withhold federal funding from school districts that do not reopen to in-person instruction."

It is insanity. It is tone-deaf, reckless and shows exactly how morally corrupt DeVos is, and to a much higher level, this sham of an administration. 

I live in Montana, and compared to so many other states, we are not experiencing the massive increases in cases; not by a long shot. 
But, the county/city where we live is seeing rapid spikes of positive cases, all age ranges, etc. But regardless of the numbers, our schools cannot open in their current state -- which as of now is basically exactly as we left them in mid-March, with no meaningful practices in place around sanitizing, social distancing, physical dividers, mask use (is it mandatory? If no, why?) 
The questions and concerns by parents go on and on, not to mention our unbelievably hardworking, caring teachers, some of whom have taught our kids since Kindergarten....now they have to solve this problem? 

This administration has literally cracked this country apart, and there has never been a time more important to vote him out in November.

This partisan herky jerky approach makes it impossible for small businesses to plan for their future. We can thank the no maskers for the death of small businesses.

I'm resisting my habitual urge to turn this into a sputtering Trump rant out of respect for these small business owners facing personal ruin. We need a plan, and these worthy folks can't wait for the Biden administration. We know the current administration is incapable of action, so I guess it's up to Congress.

We gradually reopened over the past 6 weeks and fortunately have yet had any ""spike"" in virus activity. My 91 year old mother lives in a senior residence facility that has done a remarkable job of insuring the health of safety of its employees and residents. My mother was able to withstand being quarantined in her small apartment for 2 1/2 months, my only source of personal contact being able to see her from her balcony twice a week as I bought her supplies that were left in the building's vestibule. 

If a 91 year old woman can ""sacrifice"" her personal freedom for a few months in order to ensure our safety, what does that say for the millions of younger people who wouldn't wear masks and continued to congregate dangerously at bars ,etc. in order to have a ""good time.""? My father ""sacrificed"" two years of his life commissioned in the Navy in WWII. He was proud of his service even though his college years were interrupted.

That's never going to happen. What if no vaccine is forthcoming? States, unlike the Federal government, have to balance their budget. If the majority of people are out of work then there's no tax revenue. If the majority of businesses are closed then there's no sales tax being paid. If there's no tax revenue there's no money to pay for schools, fire, police, & countless other city services. That means you will start seeing many major cities declaring bankruptcy. You will start seeing towns defaulting on their municipal bonds. This is 2nd-grade math. The pandemic is disrupting life for some Americans much more consequentially than for others. If they don’t make enough money, they can’t survive. Flattening the curve has been the road to financial & emotional ruin for these people. Their future is being destroyed every day. How are they supposed to make ends meet? Pay their mortgages, buy food & a thousand other things? The government can't print money fast enough as it is to bail everyone out. The longer we wait the worst it's going to be. That doesn't mean we can ever return to the way things were. We can't. But moving forward we can quarantine those at risk & practice good hygiene.

Now all of that will be destroyed for at least several years. Of course many of the readers here support Mr.Biden and say he will fix this after defeating Mr.Trump. However, do we really think democrats will help the small man and minority communities or will they continue neoliberal policies and help their corporate and banking friends? (see 2009 bailout)"
2020-07-13 20:20:15,"It's a shame that our politicians don't seem to understand what small businesses are or how they operate. Nor does there seem to be an understanding how this ripples through the small business community. 

Most business rely on cash flow to pay their bills. Almost no small business has cash reserves for 9 months in the bank that could sustain them.

It's simple. Many folks are unemployed. Many folks are working from home. Many folks, even if they still work, are rather putting money away than to spend it. 

So, there are many small businesses that rely on, say, 1,500 customers a month. Those customers buy meals (or whatever) for $10 / day. Now that there are only 500 customers, the entire business model won't work. If they are lucky, they can fire all employees and do the work themselves. But even then the business might not be viable because of fixed overhead like rent, internet, phone, accounting, insurance, etc. That's why so many small business are folding. 

That's not where it ends. Next, with businesses shutting down, landlords don't get paid. Malls go empty, suppliers are impacted. Etc.

The federal and state governments need to help keep businesses in business, meaning they sustain jobs - otherwise none of the billions we are spending will help. Just paying unemployment, as important as it is in the short term, will not save jobs in the long term."
2020-07-13 20:21:06,"When the pandemic happened it was clear the something needed to be done to help small businesses. Sadly, the federal definition of small biz means that large public companies or largeish private companies got the most of the money.

It is well known that lockdowns don’t allow immunity to develop, and that the virus is too pervasive and contagious to disappear. The current surges were entirely predictable. It is a failure of the media, public health officials, and our political leaders who encouraged false hope that we could beat the pandemic so easily.  And, people heard what they wanted to hear – if we put up with lockdowns are a few months, all would be well. Wrong.

Damage was also done by the media and public health officials who supported en masse protests. Massive gatherings with shouting and close contact are an effective way of spreading a respiratory virus. Many, especially people (of all ethnicities) who are now permanently closing the businesses they spent their lives building wonder why protests were OK, whereas allowing them to maintain their livelihoods is not.

The only thing that will end the pandemic is a vaccine. We are working hard to develop and test a vaccine. But there is a problem which is being ignored. We need the help of pharmaceutical companies today. Yet, many firms are being driven to towards bankruptcy by tens of thousands of enormous lawsuits.

Imagine our horror to know we are being scape-goated as evil landlords that are ripping off the poor, laughing all the way. We--unlike ALL other small business owners--are being FORCED to remain in business FOR FREE (MA is passing an extension to the eviction moratorium that will put the burdon of proof on US to prove, somehow, that our renters were withholding rent for a non-covid reason--a logical impossibility as you cannot prove a negative, of course).

You would not force a farmer to work for free, nor a nurse or a firefighter. Why am I being forced to work for free. It's insanity.

There is a poverty problem in this country. Poor people are treated horribly, and we should do far more to insure that people can afford food, healthcare, and shelter. But the idea that small-time homeowners like myself can somehow make up for the fact that our entire society is run by a bunch of Ayn Randian Libertarians is nuts... I should be allowed to do what I want with the property I own. The idea that I should be forced to serve others for free is... unamerican."

That said, there's one thing people appear to neglect in ""reopening"": y'all still need not only to keep washing hands frequently, wearing masks when near others, and socially distance, but ALSO still reduce unnecessary social mixing. Reopening will not work if the last is erased. It's only meant to allow an addition level of flexibility that should be used sparingly and with active assessment of risk in the moment. Each day. Every day. Until there's both effective vaccines and therapeutics. There are people who within living memory did manage to do this in other epidemic disease contexts - it's not superhuman to call for this."

When I do, the mask wearing etiquette of the public is atrocious at best. Most have a mask, and most wear it improperly. Once the virus comes back, it'll spread again, even with people possessing masks -- because they can't and won't calm down, slow down, and wear it properly.

Those who are diligent and could handle this are seeing our world crumble under the auspices of an  idiot and an idiotic, unprincipled, impatient, brash culture. This culture serves us well in war and capitalism.

Refrigerated trailers are moving into Travis County in anticipation of the morgues reaching capacity.

Then came Covid19, the crisis every sentient American dreaded in the hands of an incompetent Administration. There has never been anything like this before. We are dealing with increased costs and unknown delays not to mention devastating illness and death, that hit us personally. To say we are hanging by a thread is by no means an overstatement.

The consequences of widespread failure touched on here are so far reaching as to be incalculable. And when I see smiling ads from the likes of Google selling how we small business owners are adapting, I want to scream. We are not adapting. We are dying and as we do we will take everyone with us.

If they had listened to the scientists at the beginning (their guilt is making them malign Dr. Fauci now) the U.S. would now be in full recovery.

The deep pockets folk are already salivating, quietly behind their masks.  Reopening small businesses will find themselves competing with better-funded chains.

The purpose of the modern American economy is to enable as many Ray Krocs as possible, not as many small, independent hamburger joints as possible.  More Ray Krocs means more jobs managing a franchise or company-owned store under close supervision, and fewer jobs building a small, loved, unique business from scratch.  Success at such a job ends with selling to a large company or trying to become such a company and succeeding.  Retiring after a long run as a small business, and perhaps handing it on to someone who has worked there for years and shares its vision, is a form of failure.  It leaves money on the table by failing to exploit the local success of the small business to make it bigger and try for Krocdom.  

From a socialistic perspective, the question is what sort of jobs and people we want to make room for in our economy.  From a market perspective, this question is illegitimate; the competition of the marketplace will decide what sorts of jobs are available and how many.

There are ways that could be implemented to allow those who so desire to ""mothball"" their businesses for an extended  period of time, but those have to be lobbied for.

I am not criticizing those who want to close, and have been thinking about same, doing so.

2020-07-13 22:16:10,"From here, all we can see is that your country sacrificed its people and cratered its economy- all at the same time.  My heart aches for the people profiled in this story. Their extreme loss seems so unnecessary to those of us on the outside.  I am so angry for you all that you didn’t have the coordinated, federal response to this horrible pandemic.  You don’t have  the fiscal and health safety nets that have allowed those of us in Canada, for example (along with many other countries) to endure a hard lockdown, then a slow re-opening.  Our approach has saved families and small businesses- so those people who worked so hard to build those viable, vibrant businesses that give so much to our communities and country aren’t wiped off the map.  We aren’t perfect, for sure, but we have done everything we could to keep people hopeful for their health and hopeful their business could survive and come out the other side of this.  We locked down, then we tested, traced, isolated when needed and continue to do so.  We wear masks, we physically distance, we wash our hands.  We care about each other, recognizing that doing so is a benefit to all of us.  You could have nailed this-it isn’t  hard! 
My  family is very small.  Half live in Maine.  We have resigned ourselves to the fact we may not see them for years, because we just cannot open our borders until you have put out this dumpster fire.  And I am not sure you can. I hope you do. We hope you do."
2020-07-13 22:24:04,"I saw with sadness that another local small business closes its doors the other day; having worked in my parents’ modest store (before the advent of big box stores and the internet), I am particularly familiar with the precariousness of such enterprises, especially when ridiculously high rents are still due.  I can’t help wondering how many kept trying to stay afloat for a while by spending more or all of their savings, when they might ended up in a better financial condition by shutting down immediately back in March/April, only to be forced to give up now.

Small businesses are not only the economic lifelines for many families, they  are part of a community’s soul."
2020-07-13 22:33:43,"Places that crushed the virus - e.g. Vietnam and Korea - sealed off areas that had infections and/ or stopped domestic travel completely.  They tested a vast higher proportion of their population than we have and supervised the quarantine of those who tested positive.  They also traced and isolated their contacts.

In the U.S. the shutdown in March and April was not complete enough.  Too many businesses were deemed ‘essential’ and people were able to move around too much.  And we didn’t maintain the shutdown long enough in those areas of the country that are worst affected.

Wearing masks in public may now be a necessary condition of slowing the virus’s spread, but it will not be sufficient to get case numbers where they have to be.  That would require a few several weeks of genuine shutdown.  Think Vietnam, Korea, maybe Italy.

While that goes on we would need to develop coordinated testing, quarantine and contact tracing.

However, we are now in the awful position of having weakened the economy (and the spirit of many people) - with the first, underpowered shutdown and the subsequent infection weakened recovery - to the point that the kind of lock down we need to control the pandemic will have dreadful economic and possibly social costs."

No one wants to shop, no one wants to go to karaoke because it is terrifying that you might get sick. “If you build it, they will come” makes no sense when people are too afraid to go out. The governor of Texas could’ve opened the whole state and it would not have mattered. People are too leery to go out. Those that voted for Trump,Lindsey Graham, or John Cornyn or anyone else that sat and twiddled their thumbs at the State of the Union address when President Trump talked about the coronavirus in January, every single one of those voters needs to understand that they have a responsibility to make sure that when it comes time to vote again they don’t vote for these people ever again. They are not qualified to run our country.￼ They do not care.Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance. Millions of Americans are waiting in food lines. Our government and our leaders let us down. All because our leaders refused to accept the fact that they could not control this virus.

So very many restaruants fold in the natural attrition of that type of industry that I can't fathom why anyone would sign such a long term lease. That decision, looked at objectively, seems a bad one to begin with... I can see the benefit of locking in for a couple years but 10? That was just a bad decision to start and now a terrible burden for this business owner.

As well, not to make light of Mr. Larkin's situation, but I have to ask why he threw any of his goods in the trash? Seems like they could have donated their inventory to any number of places looking items to stock food pantries or shelters. 

Honestly, if I had a machines' worth of margarita and other libations, I would have dispatched it into food grade containers and frozen it for later. It'll keep fine for personal consumption for months on end. Likewise, santizer and masks etc will all still be of use to Larkin as the months with this virus wear-on, so I think it he could look at some of his expense as salvageable."

Because of how they chose to pick and choose ""essential"" businesses, they enriched large companies such as Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc. Any company that already had a large online presence or had the financial backing to make a quick switch to online were the ones that were successful. Additionally, doing more to help businesses keep people on their payroll (which is what many other countries did) rather than offering extra for unemployment  may have also helped keep many of these small businesses afloat. All sides were playing politics, so to place the blame on one party is either willfully blind or completely disingenuous."

I have been fortunate to be hired many times.  Did I sacrifice along the way.. yes.. on many aspects of life.  I made that choice and I knew going into my line of work that was a part of it.

Everyone alive experiences setbacks, disappointments and heartbreak at some point.

How many hospitals, nursing homes, food banks, clinics, home health aides, etc. could have used those supplies?  The selfishness some Americans are displaying boggles the mind.

It will take probably close to 90-days and would require zero travel and zero in-person contact outside the immediate household.

The virus doesn't care about the economy, your child's education, or your religious beliefs, it has only one goal to spread and evolve.  It is non-negotiable.  

The US needs to stop thinking it is negotiable and 100% need to take this serious and 99% need to comply with a very painful 90-days, otherwise the ruin faced by these businesses is just the first wave of the greatest economic depression to come that will last an entire generation.

It's ironic the GOP -- who are all about ""small businesses"" and ""bootstraps"" in election years -- are now MIA when it comes to aiding their own small-business-owner constituents.

For almost 10 years we’ve been planning weddings and creating the floral arrangements and last December we opened a gift shop selling small bath & locally-/minority- made items. We converted a lot of cash into goods at just the wrong time.

As far as weddings are concerned many have been postponed and some cancelled. Now that Virginia has moved into Phase 3 it’s possible to have events up to 250 people. An Executive Order stipulates that anyone indoors over the age of 10 must wear a mask unless seated and eating/drinking or have a medical reason for not doing so.

We recently contacted those clients we’re providing day-of coordination to advising them of the rules (the law) which we’ll be upholding and giving them a way out of their contract with us if they so choose (or they could just wear masks). To our absolute amazement many clients have opted to cancel with us and work with someone else less restrictive. We are being held hostage by clients who want to break the law.

As far as our gift shop is concerned we shuttered this back in March and it’s still closed. We simply don’t want to face the harassment of people entering that won’t wear a mask.

Fortunately for us we made hay when times were good but we’re fast running out.

We’re extremely disappointed that clients are simply choosing to work with other vendors that will turn a blind out to the law rather than adhere to our Governor’s orders."

A week later the state mandated all gyms shutter their doors.  We had hoped that our closure was only temporary, lasting maybe three months at the most. But protests, political arrogance, and denials have only exasperated and extended this pandemic.  We continue to stay closed, even though the state allowed gyms to reopen early June.  We have chosen to ignore the politics and follow the science, which the CDC stated early on that there should be two consecutive weeks of declining cases before reopening.  We have not achieved that metric, therefore we remain closed.  Had this administration adhered to the advice of the scientific community from the offset, maybe we would not be in this mess.  I am not hopeful that we will survive should Trump be reelected.  Our only hope at this point is that a Democratic administration prevails in November."

Great food, friendly service, Sunday afternoon jazz and a nice part of a nice town. Now it's gone. A vibrant business shuttered, a dream shattered and lots of folks out of work.

Multiply the First Street Cafe by countless other sad, similar stories across the country.

So all of these failures are attributable to the governors and local officials who forced their closure in the name of public safety. These decisions have a cost. In this case the cost is the bankruptcy of small and medium sized businesses. Sure, some would have  suffered and failed if government allowed citizens to make independent decisions about whether to go out to a restaurant, bar or business in the face of this epidemic, but business could have innovated and some would have found a way to serve their patrons safely and survive.

Small businesses, especially entertainment, food and beverage businesses, live on the edge anyway, so it is unsurprising that months of COVD shutdown might cause many to fail. I have seen business owners shake their fists and cry, “it’s not fair!” While passively doing nothing. I also have seen business owners use this situation as an opportunity to rethink their business model and find creative ways to adjust. Yes, everyone is hurting, but the idea that EVERY small business is quitting is wrong. Some are enduring, rolling with the punches and using this time to figure it out. In my opinion, we would be better off focusing on reporting about those who are creating new approaches and how ordinary citizens can better support local businesses in spite of the pandemic."

2020-07-14 00:23:24,"There is was no need to make public health and small business economic health a zero sum game. We could have had a responsive national pandemic plan that kept Covid cases low, small businesses afloat, workers finances good, and provided health insurance to anyone who list insurance due to a job loss or any other reason. Trump and his supporters are to blame."

Liberty is hard because it allows for choice and change, things the left and right authoritarians reject because either side loses its power over you if the accepted liberty and equal protection."
2020-07-14 00:29:45,"It's really sad to hear small businesses closing their doors.  Honestly, it has felt throughout the pandemic that our leaders failed to set reasonable expectations for its citizens.  You can't just go on lockdown, you need a way to at least partially shutdown the economy without businesses going bankrupt.  To set the standard that your business existing and your employees getting fed does not rely on your business being open at full capacity.  The pandemic will last for years, as will intermittent lockdowns.  People deserve to know what's expected and be given reasonable expectation.

Maybe we should give some businesses a legal option to temporarily shut their doors (or be open only at half capacity) and just not pay their bills.  And the government will cover their employees salaries.  It really doesn't matter if the bankers and capital get paid as most of the rest of us aren't getting paid either.  This would trigger a really bad depression, but the alternative is probably worse in every way.

The biggest risk here is that not only will some businesses cease to exist and others like Amazon consolidate, but also that most businesses won't take risks and invest in growing their businesses.  Many businesses were probably taking risks and trying to grow before this.  Why ever take such an existential risk again?  This in itself can cause a recession or hurt workers."

2020-07-14 00:34:21,"And like with most federal programs you just have to know how to exploit them which is sad for those who don’t know how or don’t want to (get caught.) I know one small business owner who owns a little clothing store in our small downtown and she’s its only “employee”.  She got enough “paycheck protection” to buy a brand new 30 foot RV for over $100,000. Oh and she hired a couple people she knows to work for her to satisfy that requirement so she didn’t have to give it back. I know another small business of one who was given $55,000 that he doesn’t have to pay back. This is somebody who made over $200,000 a year working part time prior to the pandemic."
2020-07-14 00:34:46,"The solution to this, which is painfully, infuriatingly obvious at this juncture, is to bail out small businesses (and people in general) for the duration of this pandemic and any lingering economic depression. For Republicans and neoliberal Democrats, this flies in the face of their idea of how the world should work. The question is, how many of us will suffer and lose everything before reality forces our political leaders to give people more money?"
2020-07-14 00:37:05,"How would the COVID mortality statistics look if folks over 65 were actually self-isolating? How busy would hospitals be if folks over 65 were self-isolating? For those who don't know, about 100,000 of the roughly 130,000 deaths have been folks over 65. About 20,000 of the remainder were over 55 and/or had serious pre-existing health problems. Do the math. We are crushing people's lives and harming our kids because the media is relentlessly promoting the idea that COVID is a death sentence and we are all in mortal peril. Sure let's wear masks when appropriate and avoid crowding indoors, but wouldn't it be easier and less harmful to really isolate 15% of the population instead of pretending we can stop all social, educational, and economic activity for a year or more? Is it actually a crisis if record numbers of people get COVID but just go home and stay in bed for several days? Oh, but I saw a story on CNN that said COVID causes permanent brain and lung damage! Yes and people can get an infection from a scratch or a cold and end up dying of septic shock (one of the most common causes of death in hospitals). Life is not free of risk but in reality the number of healthy people under 60 who have died from COVID is very small. If you want to stop early, preventable death and needless injuries put down your phone and start driving the speed limit."
2020-07-14 00:38:07,"Why are there no articles pointing out that on average (using 2017 data but it’s all about the same, google it yourself) 7700 people die EVERYDAY in the US from all causes? Since we were at 25 deaths a day to now is over 120 days. So in a normal year over 900,000 people in the US would have died during the time we have been experiencing this, so just since February to now. Considering the data clearly shows that a vast portion of the people counted as covid deaths were very old (no offense but I’ll label very old as 76+). Every death is terrible, but with life comes death. No serious person would say that the shutdowns are not doing immense social/emotional harm to millions of children and us Times readers also know the reckoning is coming for the poor and some middle class; this is conjecture but I think a conservative guess would be that a couple hundred thousand American families that were on the brim of climbing out of poverty are likely facing a decade to get back to where they were. Can someone please explain how the data supports such draconian measures?? Almost 3 million Americans die EVERY year. I’m not saying I want a million more to but I see little evidence that is what we would face given the current numbers. I know some will say “that’s 20% of cases” but you know that’s not likely, with so many asymptomatics and given what played out in New York, millions more likely had this reducing the death rate substantially."

How many times have then gone down to Home Depot or Target to buy things that we could easily buy from the Pop and Mom store down the road from where we live? How many times have we shopped on Amazon for something (sunglasses, sneakers, a smoke alarm) that we could have bought less than a mile from where we live? For too many years I've done this but this year I have stopped. Now if I need something I go out of my way (a bit) to the local store and I tell them I'm buying from them bc they support the local economy and hire local and they are important to me. So in the end I'm spending 5-10% more for all the stuff I buy each year - I'm happy (and so are the store owners) when I stop and shop local, tip well and remember what matters in my neighborhood. I'm just back from handing out 30$ to my barber for the haircut I did not go get in April, and I told him I'll see him in a month if things are better (and if they are not I'll give him another 30$ in August).

The were not obligated to use that money to aid their out of work employees or keep those worker health insurance in force. Instead they used it me make themselves even more wealthy.  Trump and the republicans threw a bone to workers instead on making sure they received decent  unemployment benefits and retained their medial insurance.

But just as a lot of people who called the pandemic a hoax and flouted social distancing protocols found out the tragically hard way that they were mistaken, a lot of small business owners who successfully petitioned their governors to reopen their states despite solid scientific evidence that it was premature to do so are now paying the consequences. And I’m sure in both cases a lot of them voted for Trump and will do so again if they live to see November. 

I still feel bad for them. But it’s sad to see how few people understand the reason this is such a catastrophe. People have been telling us for months what the situation is and how we a society could handle it a small other countries are doing.

I'm not sure how to structure it but it may actually be better to support the business owner closing and ensuring they have capital to restart or start a new business when it becomes more clear what their market needs.  There will surely be changes in consumer behavior and its worth considering how to put the business owner inthe best possible position to succeed in their ""new normal"""

To all of those in journalism who aren’t hitting that point home everyday, shame on you. POTUS has abandoned this country and I doubt we will recover. Lucky for me, I’m well educated and plan to ship out as soon as the virus is over. My personal tragedy: once I was a young person who wanted to run for public office in this country. But now all I long for is a home country complete with reason and logic. As an American, who loves her country dearly, It seems like the problems here are now insurmountable and beyond repair.

This was a former Obama administration (or tertiary) member, who said if anything, the response then should have been much bigger and deeper and extended.

So with this catastrophe on the horizon, he had a 10-year perspective and could see the problems ahead if small businesses weren't adequately supported with enough money for a long enough period of time.

I grew up in a time when the vast majority of local businesses were independantly owned and operated. I knew many of the proprietors by name and they knew me. If I had a question, a product complaint, or a product request they were there to respond in person. They were directly accountable to their customers and had a personal interest in making sure those customers were satisfied with the products and service they offered. 

Corporate retail is precisely the opposite. They are utterly unaccountable to their customers because they don’t have to be. In many places they’re the only show in town, so if you want the accountability of a locally owned business you might have to go to the nearest big city to find one. The people who make the policies and product decisions in corporate retail are a million miles away in some headquarters and are unavailable to customers. If you don’t like their policies or politics you can boycott them, but unless you’ve got 50,000 like minded people to boycott with you it won’t make a scintilla of difference.

Now we have a good shot at making it through this, but I know many aren't so lucky. The business environment is rigged against small business to begin with and this COVID-19 Pandemic made it exponentially worse.

This will impact the number of evictions as people cannot pay rent.  Bankruptcy is probably the only answer for many of these small business owners, so those who they owe money too will also be out of luck.   Meanwhile, Wall Street and the markets still seem quite oblivious to what is happening on Main Street.  At some point the chickens are coming home to roost as we say.

2020-07-14 04:58:36,"As a small business owner in Manhattan who survived the 2008 financial crash to see business boom in the last few years, I can tell you... I've never seen anything remotely like this drop in business. It's about 80%. I can close my bricks and mortar space and sell online only, but online sales have also plummeted. There is no hiding from it and silly programs like the PPP loans won't help. Better to use the funds to support the workers with extended unemployment benefits. That will truly help sustain the economy. Small business is going to be hit extremely hard in this country until a vaccine is found. In the case of retail, it will be long after that as people have stopped spending and it's going to snowball. The stock market is going to crash in a spectacular fashion once all of this becomes clear. If you've made money, sell and take your profit now."

2020-07-14 04:22:54,"NYT won't tell you, but this is not happenstance.  This is not circumstance.  This is intentional, targeted Republican policy, endorsed by Donald, masterminded by The Great Pirate Mitch and, from their perspective, working exactly as they want it.

How many global authorities do you have to hear it from?  How many historically important theorists?  How many countries now rapidly emerging from exactly the same circumstance do you have to ignore before you see this is, from beginning to end, how Republicans are determined to go.

So, we have $10,000,000,000,000 (and growing) un-directed, un-accounted, un-controlled gifts to sectors of our economy that have virtually nothing to do with everyday life in America, or ribs restaurants.

We have ""small government"" conservatives refusing to allow towns to decide to mask up.

Classic, but most embarrassing of all we have Republican Senators spewing dishonest, debunked, discredited economic tripe like ""We've given them (that would be you and me) way too much already.  They're refusing to work.  We never should have given so much.

Noting that what they're objecting to ""giving us"" is our own money; ignoring there is zero truth in their lies about people choosing to stay home; and forgetting the fact dozens of countries that supported their people are now opening successfully in ways we won't see until next summer.

Other days it's been catching up on NYT articles relating to sudden immigration changes before getting on the phone to talk to other friends that have to adjust their lives because of those changes.

All of these articles that we read are about real things, real people, really happening, RIGHT NOW.

But Trump has made the situation worse for all of us with his fevered irresponsible messaging and rejection of his leadership role. he acts like some disgruntled average Joe citizen complaining about the government's ineptitude when he is the guy in charge. How disturbing is that! We all have to cope with the cognitive dissonance that creates. 

If Trump wasn't so incapable of doing actual work, the small businesses and the working stiff would be feeling a lot more confident about the return to normalcy. Instead, confusion reigns. Mental fatigue is overwhelming us all."

If there hadn't been this 3 yr. Pandemic, and most governments, businesses, and individuals weren't living off of borrowed money, then maybe, just maybe we could of been in a better place.

It leaves its people adrift, at the mercy of the pandemic. When America looks at solutions around the world it emulates the worst - Brazil.

So far we haven't even come close to the 1918 flu pandemic death toll either. 
Worse we find ourselves unable to source or make key survival supplies. 
We badly need national level health, industrial and sustainability policies. Leadership has become focused on optimizing yesterday's stock price and public opinion polls. So where do we find leaders? Science and the military I think. Educate people to think instead of bickering.
Pull core industry back home; make things we need. Task CDC/NIH/FDA with looking forward not floating along in a bureaucratic funk waiting for the next big disease. Kick the GOP to the curb in favor a new third party, more centrist.

There would be  a whole new chain of government owned bars, restaurants, hair and  nail salons, hotels, airlines, etc.   The emphasis would no longer be on making the owner a lot of money, or sacrificing the employees happiness to maximize the customers experience.  The emphasis would be on the overall welfare of the employee, and not management, the front line employee.  President Biden demonstrated this recently when he stated that in public schools, teachers, the welfare of teachers, would come first. He said that in charter schools, that was not the mission, and that had to change.  All these new government public service providers would follow the public school model, and America would have a lot of happy employees for once."

2020-07-14 06:33:04,"None of this economic tragedy had to happen. It didn’t happen in 1957 when a flu pandemic killed over 1.1 million people worldwide. It didn’t happen in 1969 when the Hong Kong Flu pandemic also killed over 1.1 million people worldwide. Why? In neither pandemic were any businesses, schools, or other entities shut down, no matter how many people were sick and dying. Life went on, and the sick and dying were treated in the hospitals. No one complained about overtaxing the hospitals either. Back then, at least in the US, hospitals were run with 3 shifts of nurses daily instead of just two (3 eight hour shifts vs 2 twelve hour shifts today). PPE was stockpiled for emergencies instead of some MBA ordering a “buy when needed” policy that leaves hospitals unprepared for emergencies. There was no 24 hour news cycle driving fear into every living room, constantly battering each family with gloom and doom. No reinforcing of fear through “social media”.

We are barely half way to the 1.1 million dead mark we have reached twice before in modern times, but this time we have already destroyed the lives of millions economically with no end in sight. We are plunging the world into a depression worse than 1929. It’s completely unnecessary. All this money should have been going to the hospitals, not to paycheck protection and unemployment. That hasn’t done any good because the businesses are going under anyway. Beef up the hospitals and let the virus run it’s course. We’ve done it before."

Small businesses nationwide are in dire straits, but this quote about “their rules” makes it sound like Mr. Larkin may not be fully invested in the health of his community. It’s unclear from the article whether he is struggling financially so much they needed to close...and if so, why was he throwing out what he’d just bought, which the article says included perishable goods and protective equipment? If Mr. Larkin is simply closing out of frustration with rules intended to keep people healthy, rather than financial necessity, it is hard to feel any sympathy."
2020-07-14 13:41:19,"Some countries combined three measures: (1) severe shutdown of any non-essential activities ordered by the federal government and supported by local governments, (2) government coverage of a large portion of wages for small businesses during that shutdown, (3) partial relief of the shutdowns (still no large gatherings in public – i.e. sports events) only after the new infection rates reached an tolerable level (now about 1 in 100000 in Switzerland per day).

The results here: most businesses and hospitals are operating at nearly normal levels, unemployment increased (but still below 4%), and travel to and from most European countries is unrestricted.  (but masks are mandatory when using public transportation).

Since the prospect of achieving “herd immunity” remains uncertain (thus risky), this may be the only reliable approach for returning to a normal life before a vaccine becomes widely available.  

My opinion is that this type of collective effort in a society required consistent messaging from government officials at all levels, as a well as a government that people trust.  These pre-requisites may be easier to find in some countries than others."

Many of us small business owners, however, provide services to corporations, not consumers.  The PPP money allowed us to meet payroll on time as our corporate clients slowed down their payments to us and for some, business dropped off.  Sadly, the PPP monies have contributed to the success gap for small businesses as those of us who could left our offices and moved to home offices while those without this ability had minimal business left to support.  Had I owned a retail business instead of a commercial one, I probably would've shut down as well and waited until 2021 to start up again."

2020-07-14 15:23:34,"We had one job: to flatten the curve of the spread of the virus. To do that we needed the right equipment in the right places at the right time. We needed to protect the most vulnerable, not just in nursing homes but essential workers who faced daily exposure. Couldn't manage it. We needed changes in personal behavior. Wouldn't do it. We needed financial relief to the most affected,  like small businesses. Didn't do it. 

We needed to strategize like this war against the virus was the D-Day invasion, and we failed.  I wonder what the men who died that day would think of us now."

But, it's the small businesses that are taking the brunt of the shutdown impact.  Those that make low wages are making more on unemployment than ever, but too many small businesses are stuck.  And when they go out of business, their employees will face long term unemployment.

Most don't seem to know that the majority in the US work for, or own, small businesses.  It makes no sense that we cannot pull together and wear masks, wash hands, and physically distance when prudent.

This latest outbreak is among the young.  Where they vacationing at beaches, protesting in the streets, going to Covid parties, or just fed up and getting together with friends for a laugh.  

You cannot regulate good behavior.  Please everyone!

Nobody complained about making the donuts when most men under 30 went to war. The rest, including the women, went to work.

Now I've never voted republican in my life but the Democrats are hardly saviors & not likely to be unless of course you're a big donor.
Of what party was the President that signed Nafta and admitted China to the WTO ?  With the words ""There is no choice"" and turned the Midwest industrial belt  into the Rustbelt? Gutting the Middle class, Working class, & Unions, But boy the donors did well didn't they? And the Clinton's were well rewarded after they left office weren't they? But I believe the standard speech of the ""Progressives"" was they should have gotten a better education and sacrifices have to be made!
Or mention Obama who bailed out the Banks & paid their bonuses, But abandoned Main Street to try & get a grip on the porcelain has they went down the commode.
Yeah the Democrats are real supporters of the American Middle & Working class has their actions have proved. So perhaps we can skip the propaganda and admit the Democrats aren't anymore interested the the GOP in anyone but the big donors. To pretend is insult to reality. Their track record speaks for itself in large flaming letters!"

When so many businesses are and will be closing, we need to enhance funding the production and delivery of necessities: healthy food, sufficient safe, health care provided by adequately protected health care providers, etc., and to make sure all have their basic needs met.
It is time to regroup, reconsider what the coronavirus is showing us that we didn't learn during the first round of all being sent to our rooms by nature, as if, to consider what we've done to it and to each other.

Their closing leaves dozens of young people unemployed, and dark windows at prime locations in several cities.  

They are trying to figure out a new business model.  But how can any business do that, when it is not possible to envision the future?  When no one can tell when this nightmare will be over, and what normalcy will be when it is?

This economic upheaval of lives and businesses is a result of the fatally flawed conservative ideology that everyone should be left to do whatever they wish, however they wish - without respect for anyone else.  Of elevating interests of the individual and rejecting social interdependence.  Of theocrats with apocalyptic end-times visions, in which they triumphantly lead a glorious purification of America.  They are unphased by the death and economic carnage they are causing, but it is exactly what they crave.

These toxic, failed ideologies are laying waste to our country, and must be rejected categorically.  In November, we must elect candidates who embrace reason, rationality, and science, and restore governance grounded in truth and fact, not superstitious fantasies and conspiracy theories.

But it started with Chinese suppression of the facts about this dreadful disease. It could have easily been contained in China. 

We can all remember that young Chinese doctor who was arrested and told to be quiet. He died of coronavirus himself. This is no nutty conspiracy theory.

Fortunately, their offshoot brewpub Beachwood BBQ and Brewing in nearby Long Beach, and other locations, are still open and operating.

Dr. Fauci has always been forthright with the American people. I am not surprised that Dr. Fauci is now the victim of a palace coup, that his ""truth to power"" fusillades against the administration's ignorance and arrogance about the dangers of this plague have both discomfited and embarrassed the president, a man who is pathologically beyond embarrassment. 

He is a man who never took seriously that the ravages of this disease would test his powers and his ""leadership"" capabilities. He's never made any secret that he wanted a robust and vibrant economy, something that he thought might distract the attention of Americans to his refusal to even responsibly address the pandemic.

Dr. Fauci, it seemed, was the star of the show when the presidential daily ""briefings"" were must-see television a few months ago. He would take the podium and gently rebut or diplomatically refute the obvious errors and lies of the president and his vice-president about this virus, one that has now taken the lives of almost 138,000 Americans.

2020-07-13 11:51:36,"DR. Anthony Fauci has been the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH for 36 years since the beginning of the HIV pandemic. One of his primary task was to oversee the development of HIV vaccine. When daddy Bush George H.W. Bush was asked in a debate in 1988 with Gov. Dukakis who he thought was his hero. Without hesitation daddy Bush said Dr. Fauci and then he went on to say that it was because he was developing a vaccine against HIV, a virus that was very much in the news then due to the ACTUP activism of Kramer and the death of Hollywood actor Rock Hudson. To this day July 13, 2020, we do not have a deployable vaccine against HIV simply because HIV is NOT a reproducibly CURABLE DISEASE. The key difference between HIV and COVID-19 is that HIV infection is a chronic persistent viral infection that destroys T cells, critical for mounting immunity against viruses. While COVID-19 is CURABLE.
 
When Trump in the WH during a press briefing  3 months ago when will there be a vaccine against COVID-19. Trump responded in 4-6 months. Trump not knowing the FDA process involved was referring to a vaccine candidate that can be tested in human trials. He was right to some extent. The testing of candidate vaccine has already begun all over the world including in the USA at Chicago. Dr. Fauci chimed in to clarify that a deployable vaccine would be ready for administering as mass immunizations several months later after the beginning of human trials"
2020-07-13 11:49:29,Dr. Fauci’s credibility is well-established and we believe what he is saying. Anyone who is trying to ignore the realities of COVID-19 is simply in denial and running scared. This is a worldwide health issue and needs to be taken seriously.
2020-07-13 11:50:59,"Fauci should have resigned quite some time ago.  The idea that reasonable, professional people would have a long term, positive impact on Trump or his enablers is absurd.  Reasonable people get played by Trump.

The important thing about COVID is that it’s perhaps the one undeniable example of the disastrous consequences of following Republicans and their consistent “deny reality” policies.  The fact is, they’re wrong about almost everything all the time, but this time thousands are dying and the economy is tanking as a direct result of their bad policies, and this is happening in the open for all to see.

Fauci could do everyone a favor by resigning now, explaining his own errors, and offering in detail what happens when policy makers respond to a Pandemic with denials and nothing but politically motivated drivel."

They really must believe that the people are too ignorant to see through their obvious blame-shifting and truth-altering. I just hope they are wrong to believe that the public is that foolish. It is high time to rally around truth and decency, and to publicly and emphatically point out and denounce the tactics of this criminal administration whenever necessary.

For the life of me, I can’t figure out what his goals are by making polite contradictory statements, unless of course he is backing them up with tactical decisions that have some weight and affect. Is he in a position to do that? I’d like to see an in-depth interview with him where he explicates exactly what his tactical decision making responsibilities are.

Covid deaths in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic – yesterday:  0
The last time it was that low was the beginning of March – 4 months ago.

If the pandemic is “spiraling,” it isn’t spiraling up."
2020-07-13 12:19:42,You are ripe for overrun or overthrow. Americans are demonstrating to those who would do you harm that many of you are ignorant and unaccustomed to deprivation. The electrical grid holds your connection to Youtube et al and temperature control by a thread (wire).
2020-07-13 12:20:15,Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Some day we will be free of this malignant president.
2020-07-13 12:21:57,"Trump will lose the election, and he will lose because of actions taken by him and the Republican Party, Romney included. Action has been non-action, distraction, and lies. The least privileged among us are paying the highest price, largely because we clearly consider them expendable. 

Actions speak a lot louder than words, and so I think the effects of Trump, et al, denying Fauci’s accurate and painstakingly stated assessments, will sink them.

So, yes. Vote. But please, please also be aware that the Republican Party, led by Trump, will contest any result other than another four years of Trump. And they will do so in what will likely be the middle of a second round of C-19, with the voting machine in tatters."
2020-07-13 12:24:12,"If only one fraction of the effort that Trump aides spend in discrediting Fauci could be directed toward helping governors get needed protective gear for first line responders, securing cleaning supplies for teachers preparing for school opening, and advising the public on concrete ways to drive down COVID numbers, maybe we could get traction on knocking down infection rates. I thought the whole point of government was to govern - not to play the blame/shame game."
2020-07-13 12:25:06,"I know that the Trump administration is not capable of learning. Dr. Fauci on the other hand went down the learning curve about Covid-19 as the scientific evidence and other things (e.g., supply of masks) changed thru time this spring and summer.
Trump has probably never heard of a learning curve.

Sad and bad for the country to make public health experts into political footballs during a pandemic.

Trump has been so effective as a leader fighting this pandemic. He is a stable genius.
Dr.  Fauci on the other hand, after 30 years as a leading expert what could he know that our stable genus of a president does not?

What me worry?"
2020-07-13 12:25:12,"No surprise here.  It’s not like the Republican Party ever believed in science.  Your average Republican is more versed in the intricacies of Noah’s Ark than in how viruses are spread.

Plus, Fauci criticized Trump who has replaced Jesus as the object of worship for the Red State simpletons of the the GOP base."
2020-07-13 12:25:51,"Trump proposed injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body. Specifically, he cited bleach and isopropyl alcohol as examples of common disinfectants used against the coronavirus. His comments and actions have been consistently irresponsible and dangerous these past months. He wants Americans to distrust science, doctors, and the CDC."
2020-07-13 12:25:42,"Classic Trump strategy: Don’t like the message?  Attack the messenger.

The White House is concerned about Fauci’s remarks?  What about Trump’s blather over the course of the bungled federal response?

January 22
“We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.

February 10
“Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”

March 6
“But — but I think — I think, importantly: Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test.  We — they’re there.  They have the tests.  And the tests are beautiful.”

April 3
Re Masks: “It’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it...”

April 15
“We think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1.”

April 23
“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light...And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, either through the skin or some other way...And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute — one minute — and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning?”

June 20
“When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases, so I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’”"
2020-07-13 12:25:53,"So, Dr. Fauci, a long time and educated professional in infectious diseases has been wrong so many times said the president* who appears to be an uneducated buffoon whose interest is not the people but his appearances that he has beaten back covid-19 and is now our hero.

As Trump and his cabal of boot lickers continue to play down the fact, the bare facts, this virus is not just magically going away, state that 99% of infections are not bad, and, is just a Democratic hoax to undermine the president’s* reelection.

Trump’s continuous undercutting the experts, the scientists has given birth to a whole new tin-foil hat conspiracy theory movement-the masks don’t work, no worse than the flu, more died due to the flu and many more.  If those theories were true then explain the body count to those families.

Trump may occupy the office of the executive, but, his continued lack of leadership will cause many more to perish.

Lastly, this statement ""Dr. Fauci works for the Trump administration...”. Dr. Fauci reports to the administration and like the administration, they are in theory working for us.  I almost stated that Dr. Fauci’s superiors are in the Trump administration but their is no one superior to Dr. Fauci in that abomination of an administration."
2020-07-13 12:28:04,"Trump and his cronies just don’t understand how science works.  Sure, Faucci made mistaken statements early in.  But, as he learned from the facts on the ground, he corrected himself. Trump is incapable of doing that."
2020-07-13 12:28:20,"Trump desperately sends his loyalists out to pretend America’s shameful dreadful mismanagement of the pandemic should be blamed on China, WHO or Fauci. Failure to mobilize national PPE preparation, as well as Trump’s 6 week delay in acknowledging the crisis, stupidly asking each state to create policy, ignoring CDC guidelines while insisting his ban of non-stop flights from China   was genius (when actually a flop as 40,000 risky flyers coming in thru other stops)-reveal blame falls directly on Trump.
The facts, including foolish rallies where contagion runs wild, and incoherent implementation of returning to school, idiotic anti-maskers, anti-science anti-government from Trump’s base continues evidence of His incompetence, if not reckless disregard for public good. No economic recovery can emerge from this catastrophe until hospitals stop being swamped, cases decline, and everyone feels safer."
2020-07-13 12:30:19,"Where is the response to this outrageous science denial?  Why have the leading Schools of Public Health not banded together and addressed the nation in one, unified voice? What have our academies become if they are so easily intimidated and discouraged for fear of losing funding? Speaking truth to power is the sacred obligation of tenured faculty. Indeed, the tenure system was devised just for this type of situation.  JHU, Harvard,  UNC-Chapel Hill, Columbia, Emory, UofMichigan-Ann Arbor, University of Washington, BU, UC-Berkeley, Yale, UMN.... where is your joint address to the nation? The public’s health is at stake. The Virtue of the academy is at stake, and ultimately, humanity is at stake."
2020-07-13 12:30:33,The president has lied about so many things how can I believe anything he says. Believe the experts not the polititions. It's your life we're talking about here. Not some political drama.
2020-07-13 12:30:39,"That Trump aides are unfairly maligning Dr. Fauci and distorting  his statements to make him  look error-prone becomes apparent from their treatment of what Dr. Fauci said in his Feb. 29 interview. The full interview contained the notion that ""right now"" there is low risk, but ""this could change"" quickly and would require a quick reaction.  Quoting a partial statement---that is, only the part that there is low risk right now. but leaving out the warning about soon it might change, that is,  ""quoting out of context"" to give a distorted impression of someone or something is an old trick of propagandists whose intent is to attack an opponent and make him appear to be what he is not.  People who are prepared to cherry-pick and then to repeat their misleading statements again and again (another trick of these people--constant repetition )---shows that we are dealing with an administration which is not at all interested in truth ."

2020-07-13 12:34:14,"I could never understand what it is that people see in Trump; between his attitude towards the pandemic; unemployment and the economy; and BLM; one has to be that stupid or apathetic, to not see how he's not thrown thus country under the bus; but a wheat thresher."
2020-07-13 12:34:53,"One question America: Whom would you trust with your life and those of your family? Trump, or Fauci?"
2020-07-13 12:30:27,Trump and Republicans care nothing for the lives of Americans. I trust nothing he says-nothing!
2020-07-13 12:30:37,"At least Fauci never told anyone to ingest bleach...

This war on science is the true hallmark of the Trump administration as it paves the way to an authoritarian Fascist government. 

Or is it lies?  Or quelling free speech and the press?  Or anti-labor laws?  Or removing environmental protections?  Or a complete lack of a cohesive foreign policy. Or doing nothing to increase access to higher education?  Or encouraging corporate excess?  Or insane tax policies that doom our government? Or making America into the laughingstock of the world?"
2020-07-13 12:35:35,"Let me see if I have this right. The top U.S. infectious disease expert has not been asked to brief the president for over a month, and now Trump's White House is actively attacking him as he tries to save American lives. 

My American friends, your president is not content to merely do nothing while record numbers of citizens are contracting covid-19 and deaths are again rising. No, he is also taking action to discourage others from trying to stem the virus carnage. 

Words fail to capture the monstrousness of this betrayal. Your own president is attacking the people who are trying to save you. That's completely insane! Has American Trump fatigue become so pervasive that even this is met with a shrug? Trump must be removed. Today."
2020-07-13 12:36:07,"I stand with Faucci.  And, it's time the media stops giving Trump a forum for attacking others for sport.  Just don't waste my time with tabloid stuff.  Faucci did not create the virus - so to hold him accountable for it is immature and stupid...the stuff of Trump. Trump is only doing this because Faucci is credible, doesn't advocate drinking bleach, and he is a truth teller - versus a truth spinner.  We need Faucci.  I urge the NYT and others not to take the bait on reporting bullying as newsworthy."
2020-07-13 12:56:14,Denying science is not an effective strategy to fight a pandemic.
2020-07-13 12:39:59,They are going to blame the whole debacle on Fauci.  That’s this administration’s strategy: mishandle and misappropriate.
2020-07-13 12:44:20,"These weren't false statements, this is what science IS. You find out what you know and sometimes what you said is proven wrong so you revise your conclusion based on fact or evidence.

It's almost like the Trump administration is incapable of understanding science!  Almost."
2020-07-13 12:44:42,"Who cares what Trump says about Fauci.  It's way past time for Fauci to grow a backbone, resign, and denounce the anti-science ignorance the Administration is spewing.  Anyone still standing with this autocrat is a collaborator, plain and simple.

That the Times is still breathlessly touting every word of Trump also is moving them into the same category."
2020-07-13 12:47:22,"Even if Trump himself doesn't realize how much of a fool he makes of himself by setting up an infectious disease expert like Dr Fauci as a fall-guy for Trump's political battle against the Covid-19 epidemic, Trump's White house political aides should have the intelligence to know that attacking Anthony Fauci will bring them no political benefit.  The whole world excluding Donald Trump and his knuckle-dragging admirers  see how bad the United States has done in controlling the Covid-19 epidemic. And now a large majority of Americans put the blame for the excessive Covid-19 infection rate and death toll squarely on the lack of leadership by Donald Trump and his willfully ignoring the advice of the ""experts"" in favor of his own wishful thinking, instead of paying attention to what the ""scientists"" were saying. 

Trump thinks he knows more than anyone about everything. But he actually possesses only an adolescent's sophomoric intelligence. Such men are dangerous. Trump is dangerous because he has the power of the American Presidency, but the intelligence of a 5th grader who hasn't been paying attention in class."
2020-07-13 12:39:43,"This administration forces its scientists to utter falsehoods or water down findings to fit Trump’s preferred narratives, and then points fingers at them for “inaccuracies”?!?  Trump needs to be held accountable for his lies and mishandling of an epidemic that has left 130,000 Americans dead. If he twisted science to support his lies at any point, that’s just more for him to account for."
2020-07-13 12:36:22,US breaking daily incidence  and death records so time for WH to deflect attention. Trump berates bringers of bad news but hopefully Fauci will stay true to his role as a public health official. I wonder what his thoughts are on absentee voting.
2020-07-13 12:44:22,"How dare they.  Dr. Fauci has valiantly served the cause of right, literally saving lives from the podium, simply by tirelessly defending the best science he has had access to at each stage.  I do medical translation in the area of infectious diseases - and there are no lasting certainties right now about this virus.  As for 45’s comment : unlike Dr. Fauci, the T-for-tantruming toddler is a horridly un-nice man (sic), and makes nothing BUT mistakes, except when outright lying. I know which one I’m willing to bet my life on ..."
2020-07-13 12:54:08,"Trump knows what he’s doing — he is dragging this country into the gutter because that’s where he wants a fight after the 2020 election (when Biden wins). 
 
Fauci is the target now. 

Supreme Court justices are next as he realizes not even they (aside from Kavanaugh and Thomas) will let him remain  in office if Biden wins. 

The military soon after, as he realizes they’ll physically remove him. 

That’s what he wants. 

He wants the drama. He does not want to govern. 

He wants to destroy America like he destroyed the casinos that he drive to bankruptcy. 

Why?

Because he’s been rejected by the very people he wanted approval from his entire life. 

His view is if we don’t want to love him, he’ll destroy what we love (the promise of our country)."
2020-07-13 12:36:31,I’ll take Fauci’s mistakes over Trump’s any day. Fauci has lived a life of service. Trump knows only self-service.
2020-07-13 12:41:20,"It is striking that the most substantive action related to the pandemic the trump WH has taken is to smear Dr. Fauci. Rather than provide leadership and coherent national guidance, this bunch wages a political fight that is both detrimental and disgraceful. I hope their shameful behavior serves to highlight Fauci's commitment to advancing the facts and speaking honestly."
2020-07-13 12:50:07,"The very fact that a debate can even exist as to whether Fauci or Trump is more competent to advise the nation on Covid highlights the desperately frightening America in which we all now reside.  Ignorance prevails over wisdom.  Science is rejected while rumor, lies and mad conspiracy theories are accepted.  America, once guided by truth and reason, has become a country run by a lunatic and controlled by the least educated, least intelligent voters.  I see no hope for the future of this once great democratic success story."
2020-07-13 12:52:34,"We are at Trumps mercy now, he can control who lives and who dies!    Trump has reduced our CDC into his propaganda machine, the CDC Director Redmond only parrots the lines Trump approves and any hope of Covid testing has been ordered  “SLOWED DOWN” as per Trump’s outburst as his rally.    

Jared controls the procurement and distribution of America’s urgently needed medical PPE supplies and the governors are being threatened and bullied by withholding their desperately needed state funds.    This is an American Horror being played on American citizens.    Dr Fauci was the last voice of truth and reason."
2020-07-13 12:55:19,"Make a list of statements by Trump and Fauci - count who has made the most ""mistakes"".

Trump and supporters believe people trust Fauci because because they don't like Trump. Quite the opposite, I think people dislike Trump because he doesn't trust Fauci."
2020-07-13 12:45:32,"Deaths in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have dropped like a stone. 

Will deaths there now increase again with them opening up? 

Or has herd immunity been established there?"
2020-07-13 12:47:06,"I will take Fauci and his mistakes over Trump and his lies and half-baked theories any day.  Trump has actually no credibility on anything anymore and has demonstrated a complete lack of leadership in the corona virus and protest issues that our country has endured recently.  I'm only hoping that we can make it until January when hopefully, a new president is sworn in.  This country will not survive another four years of Trump."
2020-07-13 12:48:23,"Over the weekend, Trump did an interview saying he is working on an executive order on immigration that would protect DACA and provides a path for citizenship. So he is now using that to buy Hispanic votes now?"
2020-07-13 12:49:12,"Instead of writing 20 or 30 articles everyday talking about what a failure Donald Trump is as a president and more importantly as an empathetic human being,  maybe the NYT should just notify us when that has changed.

Perhaps a few days of no Trump articles would give everyone a break and more importantly drive him further to the edge as he becomes ignored.  Nothing he says has any bearing on the majority of Americans, he is largely ignored and people are mostly relying on the state governments which have at least developed more trust in some cases."
2020-07-13 12:49:11,"Oh well, if we’re not listening to people who may have said something that later turned out to be inaccurate, then let’s definitely make sure we don’t listen to the yahoo that said the virus was going to magically go away in the spring."
2020-07-13 12:38:00,"Trump's response was inevitable, Fauci trying to be a Trump whisperer was never going to work, and the US pandemic response could not be worse regardless .  Fauci trying to soft peddle the situation for what reason? He's 80 years old, he should be far more direct, what has he and other top health experts have to lose?  Seriously, this is a once a century event, it's not a drill."
2020-07-13 12:53:56,"Dr. Fauci should seriously consider resigning- he has done his 50 years in service to our nation. Yes- he wants to have a role in new vaccines but will again be marginalized if it does not fit the trump story at the time. He can do far more good now being outside the government than being inside, advising the nation and even the vaccine companies."
2020-07-13 12:46:41,"Incredible!  

That Dr. Fauci--an honorable man, a man of integrity--

--should be assailed and badmouthed by a set of people--

--led by a President--

--NONE of whom are honorable men and women of integrity.  

No,, not one.  

That the one decent man--speaking up for the common good--should be assailed and badmouthed by persons seeking only their own good!.    . . 

I think, New York Times--that (at long last) we the people have gotten wise to Mr. Trump and his toadies--his yes-men--his dishonorable underlings.  

Lord knows, we trust Dr. Fauci a whole lot more than we trust HIM.  

And I am trusting--come November we make our disdain, our loathing of this man--

--PERMANENT."
2020-07-13 12:59:35,"I respect Dr. Fauci but he has admitted that his focus is very narrow laser focused.
There are other experts around the World who offer the same or contradictory projections.
I feel that Dr. Fauci never mentions the survival rate of those infected or the fact that millions won’t be infected.
The Media also focuses on mortality.
We as a Nation need to resume so sense of Normality and need a Group of Epidemiologists to present a Plan.
As for Trump IGNORE anything he says!"
2020-07-13 12:47:51,The President said this was under control and it would disappear like a “miracle”. He implied that people might drink or inject bleach as a cure. The President mocked people for wearing masks. Any attempt on his administration’s part to discredit Fauci  - who has been the only trustworthy voice from the administration - ought to be considered a credit to Fauci.
2020-07-13 12:52:02,I have family in the US. I'm wondering if there's something in the water because they all believe Dr F is a list and Trump speaks the truth.
2020-07-13 12:58:23,"Think opening schools by waving a magic wand will work? Think again.

From Haaretz:
""Figures on coronavirus cases in Israel's schools showed that as of Thursday at 8 P.M., there were 13,696 students and staff in quarantine and that 301 students and staff were found to have the virus. Eighty-seven schools had been closed because cases were identified in them.""

Consider these numbers in relationship to U.S. population versus Israel."
2020-07-13 12:59:35,"Trump defines himself only in relation to enemies, real and imagined. Now it's Dr. Fauci's turn to make the Enemies List.

Has Dr. Fauci been perfect? No.
This Corona virus is new, and the medical/scientific community has had to learn, and course-correct, on the fly. Dr. Fauci's biggest error may have been to say masks were unnecessary (back when masks were in short supply, and it seemed prudent for the masks we had to be saved for doctors treating Covid patients). But armies of Americans began making masks, and Dr. Fauci updated his advice -- which limited the spread and saved countless lives.

Trump, conversely, is a fount of misinformation:
- “We have it totally under control...""
- 2/26 - “...when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" 
- “It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” 
- “Anybody that needs a test, gets a test.""
 
And there's his foolery on disinfectants and UV light as potential treatments, his lie that 99% of patients recover just fine, his refusal to mask up, and Jared hoarding the federal stockpile. Trump has cost tens of thousands of lives, and saved NONE.

I wish Dr. Fauci (and Dr. Birx) had resigned in protest when Trump ignored their advice and held his rally in Tulsa. I'm sure a major media outlet would hire them until Joe Biden reinstates them to their posts in January."

Dr. Anthony Fauci is a success.  Donald Trump is a failure."

Faux News (we distort, you deride) is exaggerating the false equivalencies and conspiracy theories for the base. Demonizing science is what is killing us and making the US response so pitiful."

Now we have an even greater height of madness in a White House targeting the country's premier epidemiologist -- because the president doesn't like to be told the ugly truth: that his handling of the pandemic has been not only incompetent but totally inadequate. No wonder the rest of the world feels sorry for us. I feel sorry for us for allowing this to happen.
2020-07-13 13:16:24,"As the Trump administration presses for mandatory reopening of all primary/secondary schools and refers to Europe, someone should look into the differences between schools in those countries that opened more successfully. I suspect they rely much more on natural and better ventilation in classrooms, have smaller class sizes, have universal healthcare and to a larger degree have a greater sense of adhering to policies and practices that benefit the community as a whole. I don’t think valid comparisons can be made for using other countries as a benchmark for our schools."
2020-07-13 13:13:52,"The Trump administration should be ashamed of this behavior, but then again they have no shame. Dr Fauci has been in the service of this country for many years, served honorably and intelligently to save lives. Most thinking people realize that COVID 19 was an evolving story and we are learning something new every day. The Trump administration is failing miserably and now resorting to a slimy campaign of selective quotes to undermine Dr Fauci’s reputation. These are the acts of desperate people, remember the comments that Trump made about John McCain. I cannot help but wonder and fear just how far the Trump administration will go to try and remain in power.   Remember this in November. VOTE, vote as if your life depended on it, because it does."
2020-07-13 13:00:24,I'll take Fauci facts over Trump fictional dribble ANY day of the week.
2020-07-13 13:02:46,"Giroir on MTP also participated in the undercutting of Fauci, saying that he had made mistakes. Like Giroir didn't - even on that very program - saying that the positive tests were leveling off.

These people- him, Birx- are disgracing themselves with their kowtowing to the Fuehrer.  They must be solidly for science & not participate in the politics, or else resign.  If they think the country needs them, they are fools- Trump is using them to hide behind."
2020-07-13 13:15:45,"Typical Trump cowardice, doesn’t have the guts to fire Dr. Fauci, but starts to undercut him. Plus doesn’t have the guts to do it himself, has some aides spread the rumors to reporters.

I know cowardice because I’m a coward, but now I don’t feel as bad because Disastrous Donnie is a bigger one than I am."
2020-07-13 12:36:27,"To Mr. Trump, Dr. Fauci makes a mistake when he speaks the scientific truth, instead of following the cult of MAGA.

November is coming!  The Kool-Aid must be spilt!"
2020-07-13 13:04:47,"The biggest mistake Dr. Fauci made was getting involved with the Trump administration ""health response""."
2020-07-13 13:05:54,The continuing popularity of Dr. Fauci clearly makes Donald Trump very grouchy.
2020-07-13 13:01:35,"Three stories are almost incomprehensible:

26% of Americans believe Trump instead of Fauci.

Rice University and New York Times thinks inside a big tent is the same as being outdoors.

Wealthy New Yorkers outside the city because of the virus don’t do their census online."
2020-07-13 13:06:15,"Dr. Fauci should put out a press release enumerating the litany i=of lies and mistruths that Trump has uttered since the beginning of this pandemic: ""It will all just disappear, folks."" ""It's a Democrat hoax, folks."" ""We're doing a fantastic job, folks."" Trump is nauseating."
2020-07-13 13:10:47,Experts are sometimes wrong. Liars are right every time.
2020-07-13 13:14:05,"Fauci says what he knows, and he has been learning. He is obviously thoughtful and kind. Trump doesn’t care what is true and lies to manipulate and to demand fealty from others by having them have to acknowledge the untrue as true. Trump is petty and demeaning. Who are you going to trust?"
2020-07-13 13:16:01,"Fauci has the opportunity here to be a Patriot. By resigning and making a public statement, he will garner enormous media attention... which he can use to enlighten Americans.  I'm sure every news station (except Fox) will clamor to have Fauci give daily briefings on their channel.  My question is this:  If Fauci resigns, can he still get up to date information from the CDC, or can Trump block their releasing information to Fauci?"
2020-07-13 13:18:17,"So the campaign office of President ""it will go from 15 to 0"" and ""it will go away before May"" is trying to catch Dr. Fauci in having made statements that were not 100% correct.  This would be funny if it wasn't so SAD."
2020-07-13 13:17:37,"Fax machines?

The most expensive healthcare system in the world can't even clear the emailed spreadsheet hurdle and we're supposed to crush this disease?"

2020-07-13 13:18:28,Trump's desperation is palpable (unfortunately).
2020-07-13 13:25:53,"It would be informative to compare the statements, side by side, since the beginning of the pandemic of both Faucci and Trump. Given the polling, it’s clear that the public can distinguish between wishful thinking/lies and statements based on experience, scientific method, and data."
2020-07-13 13:03:53,"Why do I get the distinct feeling that the current administration wants to get me killed by the virus?
This would make sense if the current administration was being blackmailed by Russia, for instance.
Why did the current administration call me, a liberal, scum?
That would make sense if it cared not one bit about me, a US citizen by birth and third generation American.
November can't come soon enough.
Lock them up."
2020-07-13 13:19:19,"Trump needs to blame someone for his monumental incompetence that has killed over 135,000 Americans.

2020-07-13 13:12:41,at least he should put a lobbyist for the mask producing industry in charge of covid19...
2020-07-13 13:16:40,If Trump is really unhappy with Fauci he should fire him immediately. Let the voters decide who to believe with respect to the virus. Trump knows the answer and will not take a chance on the immediate dismissal of Fauci. Just keep running a nasty campaign to undermine the credibility of Fauci.Typical Cohn/Trump strategy.
2020-07-13 13:21:45,"The endlessly hopelessly stupid Trump administration is now attacking Fauci instead of planning, funding or coordinating a response to the virus. Even better, they're threatening schoolchildren!? This is a historic collapse, a huge death count and the Republicans are still merrily digging graves to make a few bucks."
2020-07-13 13:18:58,"Falsely arracking perceived foes (i.e. anyone who contradicts him) and attempting to control the narrative (i. e. lying) are Trump’s only skills.  He has two moves and he’s using both to wound our national treasure, Dr. Fauci.  We cannot stand for this!  Write to Congress."
2020-07-13 13:22:09,"If Americans lose trust in Fauci, we will be left in a vacuum.  I understand how that could benefit Trump in some sick way - “it was Fauci who caused this catastrophe, not me” - but the human toll will be devastating.  Can it really be that the White House has such contempt for American lives?  It has seemed that way for months, but it’s still hard to believe."
2020-07-13 13:20:42,"We all wish Trump was a better president and a better man. Though he has the air of a person who is in charge, who knows who may be controlling him? Big Business? The Church? He spreads disbelief in everything he doesn’t like as a hoax. Even global warming, of which this virus is a preview of coming attractions.
I happen to be reading ""The Death of Expertise"" by Tom Nichols now. The book talks about how ordinary people think they know more about things than people who have been studying and living the subject all their lives. Like Dr. Fauci, who is almost the only public figure I believe. We’re in a war against death now. It’s not the time for know-nothings to control this pandemic."
2020-07-13 12:50:26,"Here's my take on why Trump and his aides are attacking the well respected, intellectual Dr. Fauci, Mark Meadows, Stephen Miller, Jared Kushner, Kayleigh McEnany are in deflection mode, it has been close to three weeks since the Tulsa and Arizona Rallies, both times his base were asked to sign a document that should they contract COVID Trump's Campaign and Administration could not be held responsible, question du jour, how many of his base have now either been infected or worse passed. People will stand with Trump provided it does not affect them personally, so, Trump sees the danger sign, his aides say they were given wrong information from the get-go, Fauci is the scapegoat, after all, Donald Trump loves to mention ""I Love white uneducated people"" in other words he is calling them stupid and gullible.
Let us not forget he is the master of con and branding, Mark Meadows had been a Republican Congressman he knows how to spin. I don't do twitter, but wouldn't it be a thorn in Trump's side and his base if the following #we stand tall with Dr. Fauci, vote Trump out in Nov. would go viral.  Donald Trump you should have remained a private citizen, Americans and people around the world now see you for what you are a con, incompetent, a toddler having tantrums minute by minute, so why don't you go back to your favorite game, golf, Twitter, Fox News, these are only things you are qualified to do, take your private jet and family and move closer to your friend Putin, Dr. Fauci rocks!"
2020-07-13 13:23:01,Trump & company are putting everything on the economy now. All in!
2020-07-13 13:23:22,"Trump hates truth. That's why he speaks so little of it. Trump hates facts because they get in the way of his fantasy spin on everything. Dr. Fauci is a scientist who deals with facts and truth. He's old. He's got nothing to prove and nothing to lose but his dignity, professional standing,  and sense of morality. A man like Fauci isn’t out for a buck. He's here to save lives, our lives, the lives of our parents and children and loved ones. He will not hide the truth￼ nor allow Trump to obfuscate and posture and spin lies that Covid-19 is a non-issue, a past threat. Trump only looks out for Trump. He doesn’t have the ability to empathize with anyone. Fauci is doing his best in a David vs Goliath scenario that is only going to intensify."
2020-07-13 13:24:54,"For Donald this is just bad PR about a disease. For his ideological masters, this is ""culling the vulnerable and useless populations at low cost."" Deny the pandemic on Fox and you get a seat in the White House-- been a formula for 7 months. Watch that writer for Tucker Carlson slip into Trump's inner circle -- give it 2 weeks. He was anther fake-firing. I see Trump's Denialist propaganda now intensifying in countries around the world, not just the Trumpite wannabe in Brazil. Part of Denialism is fake or misleading medical opinion about how ""hard"" Covid is to catch. There ya have it, the TrumpVirus angel with the golf club."
2020-07-13 13:25:55,"Dr. Fauci is a well respected doctor, scientist and expert in his field. tRump is completely corrupt and completely incompetent in everything he does."
2020-07-13 13:26:16,"Blame the messenger! It’s such a dumb strategy on the President’s part. If he was simply leading now, wearing a mask, promoting testing and contact tracing, supporting states, he’d guarantee his re-election. Instead, he embodies the corrupted aspects of our national life. It’s a fascinating public study of emotional derangement. Too bad it’s coming at a cost of 25 million infections by January 20."
2020-07-13 13:27:43,"One thing is very clear:
If you are going to tow Trump and Whitehouse lies and not stand your moral ground - you will face this music that Fauci is now. Look up superb example as of patriots like Col Vaidman and others. Not saying Fauci is not a patriot. He is doing an excellent service and has always. Just wish he was more directly honest early on."
2020-07-13 13:23:21,"What gives science wisdom, and people’s willingness to trust what it says, is it’s ability to admit error, learn from it, and move-on. Dr. Fauci is a scientist. Trump lacks any semblance of being wise. He would rather watch as over 130,000 people die rather than admit to making a mistake. He’s a fool, not to be trusted. Thank you, Dr.Fauci."
2020-07-13 13:27:55,"Dr. Fauci is being discredited by the Trump administration.  This is a prelude to firing him.  Anyone who disagrees with Trump is removed.  He wants to be surrounded only by ""Yes"" men and women.  What he is doing is so dangerous.  What will it take for his allies to finally break ranks and side with humanity?"
2020-07-13 13:27:14,"It's shameful, that many Americans trust what Trump says, and are starting to demonize Dr. Fauci. At this point, many of Trump's more devout followers will march off a cliff, if told to do so. Their movement is unique in the world, and a shame to this country, when they politicize the wearing of masks to protect the public. It's no wonder Americans are no longer wanted or allowed to visit so many countries."
2020-07-13 13:29:18,"This criminal enterprise currently occupying the White House, this gang of semi-organized criminals, does not care whether you live or die.
They don’t care if you survive this or not.  Trump has decided to accept Covid 19 as a kind of eugenics.  To stifle Dr. Fauci is an admission that the Trump Administration values money over the lives of the American people.  A man who has unsupervised chats with Putin flexes his tantrum muscle by allowing this virus to sweep through communities, killing off the old, minorities, the disenfranchised, the institutionalized, the jailed.  
Please do not tell me that humanity has evolved from such purposeful acts of genocide.  World War II was fought against these kinds of forces, not all that long ago.
Evil is like acne.  Trump has come to a head.  We will retain scars."
2020-07-13 13:29:55,"Trump, Republicans, Putin, and Fox News were able to discredit Marie Yovanovitch and Lt. Col Vindman.  They have gained a lot of expertise along the way in doing so.  Taking on Dr. Fauci is only the next step on the ladder."
2020-07-13 13:30:07,"The majority of outbreaks are in republican led areas. 

We have just over 3.5 months until the election. 

There is ZERO chance republican led areas get this under control by then. 

It will only get worse if for no other reason than they are overly invested in their denial. 

...but they would just need to look at the data from NY to course correct. 

...but of course they won’t.

2020-07-13 13:31:52,Questioning Fauci’s expertise at a time when the virus is surging in several states is just priceless. And desperate. And unfathomably stupid.
2020-07-13 13:45:38,"The lack of leadership the administration has had through this challenge defies logic.  When frustrated state governors need to consider forming a multi-state consortium (as they did in April) to get what they need, our federal government has failed them.   Our continued national failure is now on display for the world to see.  The administration has few options other than attempts at deflection and subterfuge.  

It is ironic to me at at a time that symbols of the confederacy are (rightly) being torn down, our country failed (again) by acting like a loose confederation of states, instead of one nation with singular leadership and direction."
2020-07-13 13:37:50,"""Dr. Fauci?  I don't really know him.  I think we met once or twice.  I meet a lot of people.  More people than anyone has ever met.  People say it's amazing how many people I meet every day.  More than any other president has ever met.  Many people tell me that Dr. Fauci makes a lot of mistakes.  Lots of them.  I hear his grades in college were bad, very bad and the school he went to was very bad.  I was first in my class at Wharton and what was Fauci?  I hear he was last and we're looking into that very strongly and my people tell me they can't believe what they're finding."""

2020-07-13 13:39:45,"We all need to stand with Dr Fauci.  The only way this terrible disease will be controlled is by listening to public health professionals.  France and Italy, both with three times the population of Florida have new cases in the hundreds yesterday.  Florida had over 15,000.  This virus is real, and deadly, and the President has mishandled this."
2020-07-13 13:41:00,"Just write what the experts are saying. I couldn’t possibly care less about Trumps same old boring shtick, he’s nothing now, old news."

Yes, we have medical might to reduce death numbers  from millions to thousands. Compare to Spanish flu.

However, any new virus or some other organism causing pandemic is serious threat to life develops an effective treatment or protection method. 

HIV, Hepatitis B-C are well-known examples. Many people didn't even consider these are important diseases.

2020-07-13 13:35:07,"The administration has a lot more to fear from Fauci than he has to fear from them.  The ""worst"" they can do to him, is to get him out from under their power.  The worst he can do to them is to get out from under their power, so he can speak freely.  A ""retired"" Fauci could do more of what he want to do (and what they don't want him to do).  Right now they have the ability to block him from media appearances.  If he ""retire"" he would be on the big networks every day."

2020-07-13 13:44:54,"Admiral Brett Giroir was on the Sunday shows yesterday, making sure the message that Dr. Fauci is “often wrong” got out there. I don’t understand this guy. He wears a uniform of the Navy, yet he is clearly spreading Trump’s propaganda. Talking up our testing ability (which is inadequate), and claiming we have PPE we don’t have. 

I just hope people will feel safe enough to vote in November. With a raging pandemic, the vote will be suppressed. One party assumes that will be good for them-and they are in the White House."
2020-07-13 13:40:23,"Fauci changed his mind after learning of new evidence. We should all know by now that conservatives/Republicans have no concept of that, period. It’s not possible for one of them to “see the light,” or have a critical thought, for that matter."

His censorship of Dr. Fauci borders on criminally culpable."
2020-07-13 13:51:15,"Dr. Fauci is needed now more than ever. Ideally, Fauci will continue to speak directly to the media which eagerly covers his every word. When Trump fires him, it will be perceived as a Code of Honor and elevate Fauci's standing in the eyes of the public.

The immediate threat is Trump's imminent assault on our children. To serve his reelection campaign, Trump must convince enough Americans that all is well, schools should open, but every district will do it differently. If Fauci were to visit Fairfax County Schools and comment on the excellent work they're doing to safeguard our teachers and kids, many of their methods might be adopted by schools across the nation.

What's been missing all along is effective leadership. Trump has demonstrated he's completely unsuited for his job whereas Fauci has offered reason, competence and experience. If Fauci were to elevate & publicize Fairfax Schools, thousands of lives could be saved. 

It's apparent we cannot remove Trump from office, but we can still save thousands of kids from disease by parlaying Fauci's spokesman skills with a school model for the rest of the nation to examine."

2020-07-13 13:47:22,"I suppose if Dr. Fauci is fired the Covid-19 pandemic will disappear “like magic”. There won’t be anyone left in the White House to sound the alarm. 

It is difficult to imagine less leadership in a crisis. If Republican leadership does not step in and remove this president through the 25th Amendment, the United States will be unrecognizable in a few months.

I’ll always be amazed that those who continue to placate the child in the Oval Office think their careers are more important than the fate of the nation. But what we see is what we get."
2020-07-13 13:47:37,"Dr. Fauci said that “as a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don’t think you can say we’re doing great. I mean, we’re just not.”

The disgraceful attacks on Dr. Anthony Fauci, the one credible, honest voice in coping with the Covid-19 virus pandemic that Trump has turned into a catastrophe, is beyond despicable. It's part of his ""kill the messenger"" and full-speed ahead with denial, delusion, and, of course, disaster. Dr. Fauci is trying to save lives while Trump, to be blunt, is taking them by the tens of thousands with his ""Reckless Endangerment"" campaign to reopen the economy that now includes the public schools in the midst of the out-of-control virus raging in the states he pushed to reopen without regard to his own weakened C.D.C. guidelines. This is pure insanity; pure madness; and, as his niece Mary Trump who has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology has just revealed, Donald Trump is mentally ill. And one must ask where are Drs. Deborah Birx and C.D.C. Head Robert Redfield also physicians who as this hour approaches midnight need to defend their colleague and the public health rather than a mentally ill man in Donald Trump?"
2020-07-13 13:54:04,"Yeah, remember when Fauci said the virus would disappear like magic and that it was just another Democratic hoax?  Oh, wait, that was Trump.  Never mind."
2020-07-13 13:54:20,"Can you imagine an American administration undermining its own infectious disease expert in the midst of a raging pandemic?  I couldn’t have either, until the Trump era.

There is no middle ground with Trump.  Fauci has tried his best to avoid directly criticizing the staggering incompetence and dishonesty of the presidential pandemic response, and in fact has been frustratingly mild on the topic.

But that is not enough for Trump.  Anything short of blind loyalty in service of Trump’s re-election, including the willingness to end thousands of American lives by openly lying, is not enough.

Trump is a cancer that destroys everything around him.  We may still have time to save ourselves and our country if we remove him in November."
2020-07-13 13:53:28,"Not sure how his lack of access to trump is considered to be a bullet point in WH criticism of Fauci. I think for anyone with respect for accuracy and science, it adds to his credibility.

As for being wrong, yep, he was. He also corrected himself. This is what decent, smart people do: when they discover a mistake they've made they admit it, correct it, and carry on. (Do I need to point out the contrast with trump? Well, to be fair, trump does carry on.)"
2020-07-13 14:02:37,"What a terribly unfortunate mess. 

This tug of war between Dr. Fauci and the political echelon is symptomatic of a clash of priorities between science and medicine, on the one hand, and the ulterior political motivations of an Administration run amuck, on the other hand.

You may need an electron microscope to actually see the virus; but, it is still far too big to be swept under a rug."

They are scrambling and flailing badly, and this tepid rebranding effort is way too little, way too late."
2020-07-13 14:03:51,"One of the most distressing aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic is how many people have been running their own little 5th grade science experiments on viral spread, to learn what science already knows.

Yet even taking basic protective measures for oneself and others seems to be a problem. When people imagine that not wearing a mask in an indoor public place is somehow an expression of their “individual freedom,” or that it’s “hurting the economy,” they’re not only endangering everyone else – they’re also ensuring that much more stringent measures will be necessary later in order to avoid mass fatalities. It’s exactly the weak, dismissive response – especially early on, but then encouraged almost daily – that has put U.S. fatalities ahead of every other country on Earth.

Fifth graders have more courage than this,.... if not brains.

This doesn’t even require hard “lockdown” or economic disruptions. It just requires enough common sense to use a combination of efforts to reduce infective contact by about 62% in order to substitute for immunity. That combination of measures includes setting gatherings outdoors when possible, keeping social distance, maximizing fresh airflow, limiting group size and wearing a mask in confined indoor locations like stores, elevators, offices, and shared transportation. It’s the combination of containment actions that matters.

If you were alive on 9/11, just think of it as having an ""enemy"", if that works. Maybe Covid needs a more ""foreign"" name."
2020-07-13 13:59:27,"I can think of any number of universities, laboratories, and other scientific organizations that would be proud and eager to have the good Dr Fauci among their ranks. And we’d all be the better for it. Onward, Dr. Fauci!"
2020-07-13 13:59:35,"The picture says it all.  A few people are wearing masks while others are not.  Until Americans understand that wearing a mask is not a political statement but a necessary health measure, this virus will continue to spread throughout the country.  It will kill or cripple older people (think of grandparents, aunts, and uncles), impair or kill younger ones, and kill the economy.  

Donald Trump is not an MD.  He is not a genius.  He does not know everything and he knows very little about how science works.  The only thing he does know how to do is lie and, along with it, blame everyone but himself for the mess we're in now.  Therefore, take whatever he says with a grain of salt.  WEAR A MASK, wash your hands, keep your physical distance."
2020-07-13 14:03:24,"While there is very little in the way of humor about what the coronavirus is doing to Americans due the criminal abdication of President Trump's sworn duty to protect the American people, this might be one of the few exceptions.

How about a side by side chart of the President's misstatements (aka lies, exaggerations and ignorance) and  and the one the White House released regarding Dr. Fauci?

Trump's greatest hits would of course include: injecting bleach or ultraviolet light to cure the disease. We will have zero cases to worry about. It will disappear.  There's testing available for anyone who wants it. It will be over by (pick date he and Pence cited several). There is nothing to worry about. Who could have expected this. Obama left no plan (other than a detailed plan on what steps to take in the event of a pandemic and tabletop exercises for the Trump transition team who failed to attend).

The list goes on and on but let's not forget the most tragic-comedy assertion that any medical professional or disaster response specialist would spit their coffee over when looking at the metrics and considering steps this administration has failed to take:

""We are doing a great job."""

2020-07-13 14:07:31,Isn't it just astounding how silent Republican congressmen and senators have been about the Trump administration's ineffective response resulting in massive infection in death of their constituents?  Every policy decision coming out of the administration increases the risk of infection and death.  There's a pattern here.  It's really hard to come up with a decent explanation that doesn't detect an administration saturated in malevalence and hostility towards American people who are still alive.
2020-07-13 14:10:56,"Two months ago, Dr. Fauci testified before members of the Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee and warned that if there was a rush to reopen without following guidelines, his concern was “we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks. The consequences could be really serious” and in fact, opening too soon “could turn the clock back,” and that not only would cause “some suffering and death that could be avoided, but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery.”

Yeah, is it no wonder why Trump wants to shut this medical expert down for good?

The fact that Dr. Fauci was not present at Pence’s coronavirus task force briefing last week was a huge red flag.  I guess it doesn’t matter that Dr. Fauci is the government's top infectious disease expert.  

If Trump decides to sideline this guy completely or worse, yank him off the task force permanently, that action could bring incredible pushback to the point where people will be so outraged, so close to the November election, it could have irrevocable results for Trump.  

Besides, there are a plethora of other credible news outlets that would be more than happy to hear what Dr. Fauci has to say.

I think since Trump and Pence continue to live in fantasy land, they should relocate to Florida and take up residency at Disney World.  They'd probably feel right at home there. . ."

We are plagued with a ""president"" who fancies himself a quasi demigod whose every decree is all-powerful, and he's bolstered by fawning sycophants whose egos drive them to appear like they are superior and in competent control.  It's once again bureaucratic hubris vs. nature, and nature (as always) is winning.  Compounded by the frightening number of mentally unbalanced citizens who, instead of being in asylums where they belong, walk freely in public and bellow ridiculous conspiracy theories, we have a foul stew of virus and lethal ineptitude.  And now the administration, led by a man recognized by non-cultists as being intellectually lacking, is doubling down on their desperate need for supremacy, and is upping their hostility toward science in general and the highly lauded Fauci in particular.  Americans are now BARRED from setting foot in Europe, our disgraceful Education Secretary is pressuring schools to reopen so she can pretend normalcy reigns again (children and teachers don't own yachts, so they're expendable), and Covid cases continue rising with STILL no competent response from the administration.

Someone should really take a good look at Fox News and OANN and their responsibility in the proliferation of this virus. Conservative friends, in the face of all available evidence, continue to report the Coronavirus numbers are vastly inflated, people shouldn’t give up their “ freedom” and wear masks, the President is going a bang-up job, and the virus will soon be over. And they continue to travel by plane, go about their business as usual and refuse masks unless required to do their grocery shopping.


Why? Because these disingenuous conservative outlets along with Rush, Ann, et al tell them it’s A-OKAY. The Murdoch’s do nothing. Sinclair does nothing. OANN does nothing except spew the party line.

The administration lies to our faces. 


Meanwhile the virus rages across America. The home of the free and the brave? And a substantial number of our fellow citizens play right along.

I don’t wish its spread to anyone or any place.Yet sadly it seems we have devolved to Trumpian swaths of the country having to deal with first-hand exposure to the deadly consequences of the virus in order for them to start to believe something approximating the reality of its viciousness.

The disinformation that results from Trumpism’s stranglehold on the truth, science, health, education, the free press, and other channels for promoting our nation’s general welfare, all so that the Liar-in-Chief and his cronies can stroke his fragile ego and line their pockets, is as great a menace as the disease itself because, among other deleterious consequences, that stranglehold is aiming to reduce to rubble our greatest scientific minds—the very expertise that we need to find a way forward.

-Move to discredit Fauci

Bold move."
2020-07-13 14:16:28,"Fauci is a one trick pony - Shut everything down! Since March most of the country, especially here in the northeast dutifully followed his advice in order to ""bend the curve"" and prevent hospitals from being overrun. Had he instead focused on protecting the at risk cohort, like the nursing home residents responsible for nearly half of the deaths and a large percentage of hospitalizations I suspect president Trump would be paying more attention to his advice. Perhaps if Fauci had bothered to raise a fuss when governors Cuomo and Murphy ordered nursing homes to admit Covid positive patients and exacerbate the mortality and hospitalization rates in their states the families of he deceased might be coming to Fauci's defense. Instead of addressing that failure, Fauci chooses to berate young, healthy adults for daring to live their lives and demands what amounts to a perpetual shut down. After 4 months of being subjected to his ineffectual  demands, it's clear that president Trump isn't the only one not listening to him any more."
2020-07-13 14:16:57,"Fauci repeatedly says that his advice is based on best scientific evidence, but he does not claim that he is infallible.   At the beginning of the pandemic of unknown proportions, he advised caution. Months later, looking back at his advice, with certainty we can say that his advice was on the mark and was important to follow. The few statements cited by the White House that were questionable are within the scope of forward looking statements in uncertain times.  The WH, however, has not compared Trump's record to Fauci's or to other medical leaders. On Fed. 26, Dr. Messonnier said that it was not question of ""if"" but ""when"" the pandemic would hit the US.  On Feb. 27 Trump said ""cases could fall to zero in a ‘few days.’""  Who was right? Trump said ""We pretty much shut it down."" (Feb. 2)  ""...we're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. (March 10)   Compare these to Fauci's assessments: ""Bottom line, it's going to get worse"" (Mar. 11) """"...between 100,000 and 200,000 people may die from COVID-19."" Mar. 29.  Who was right?  The WH statements are incredibly biased and politicized.  They are dangerous and can cause deaths that are otherwise avoidable.  To protect ourselves, our family, and our friends, the safe way forward is to listen to medical experts."
2020-07-13 14:22:09,"Dr. Fauci, stand your ground; we are listening.  Do not let Donald Trump and his sycophants silence you.  We are on your side; God knows, we need you.  We will not let Mr. Trump win this battle of wills.  He is on the wrong side of history.  He does not care about us, even his own MAGA family.  Speak up, Sir.  And keep on speaking!"
2020-07-13 14:21:32,"So, when faced with a staff member who is more trusted than him, instead of piggy backing on that person's trust to build his own, Trump works to tear down the trusted staff member.  That pretty much sums up much of Trump's modus operandi.  Rather than build up, he tears down, regardless of the consequences to the greater god."
2020-07-13 14:24:39,"Its no surprise that anyone who deviates from Trump's reality will be demonized, vilified, or trivialized. If Fauci did anything wrong it was that he didn't distance himself from  Trump sooner. 
The pandemic is spiraling out of control and Trump continues to push to reopen schools and a return to normalcy.  We will soon see that just asking people to wear face masks may slow the growth rate but will not in all probability reverse the trend. No Governor wants to return to strict lockdown, which is really what's necessary to regain control of the virus. Americans everywhere will survive simply by social distancing and being very selective in the places they will  encounter other people. Grocery stores should re-institute  exclusive hours for   those with higher risk to the virus. Parents should be very cautious about reopening schools. Most schools lack the funding to institute the necessary changes  to truly protect children.  Moreover they lack the knowledge, making this a giant experiment. 
The most important question everyone should ask, is whats the rush?  Other than the November election. When this is over, and a vaccine is available  the economy will recover, it won't be instantaneous.  But other than the Fed backed stock market how much can the economy recover with a pandemic that is spiraling out of control?"

The other factor driving fax usage for communicating to public health is the low level of automation in public health settings - systems may be either antiquated or non-existent.

Unlike most Americans, I have earned a degree in STEM and understand the way science describes reality is more reliable than my five senses plus my imagination as people are born to understand their world naturally. I understand that one percent risk means that among a million tries must happen ten thousand times. So I respect the peril from this novel virus in a pandemic. 

Trump is a nihilistic and narcissistic person who has no morals and no interest in fulfilling his oath of office. He refuses to lead and it’s effectively removed a reasoned national response from having a beneficial effect.

He understandably, but deliberately, lied about the value of masks so that medical masks could be kept for healthcare workers.Those statements by Fauci and Trump's refusal to wear masks in public partly explain why people never have entirely accepted, partially because of those statements and actions, the value of masks which  doctors knew for a century."
2020-07-13 14:47:24,"I have been fortunate to be working thru the pandemic.  I wear a mask, I practice social distancing, I do not listen to anyone in Washington. I listen to science. I am appaled at States that think it's ok to crowd bars & the beach and not make masks mandatory. People. Do NOT keep trump in office. He has been in over his head since he rode down that stupid escalator.  Enough."

Thankfully, that's the way Dr. Tony Fauci's mind works.

Unfortunately for America, for the Trump Administration, it's more like:

“When the facts change, we shoot the messenger -  and the facts.”

2020-07-13 14:55:11,"I beg Fauci to resign. Write an op-ed explaining how science works, how the epidemic is serious. Just do it. Trump, the guy you work for, is gaslighting you. Fauci is credible, likable and trusted. All things Trump will never truly be, and this crushes Trump’s wimpy ego."
2020-07-13 14:49:07,"A house on my street had a large gathering and no one wore masks. While walking my dog at a park, there was a large BBQ gathering and no masks. 

How hard is it to just lay low this summer? Read a book, learn something new, build something, etc., etc.

I feel for the healthcare workers."
2020-07-13 14:55:08,"Dr. Fauci has led this country for emerging infectious disease for the past 4 decades included HIV/AIDS, SARS, MERS, Ebola, H1N1 2009, Zika, and now covid-19. At age 79, he continues to serve as a Public Health officials and I believe it is in his DNA as a physician and love of this country. It is disheartening to see this corrupt and inept administration want to silence him just because he speaks the truth and scientific facts to save life.

Mr. Navarro reported to put pressure on FDA to legalize hydroxychloroquine and economic advisor Kudlow said, "" School should be opened with face mask, social distance and testing. It's not that hard to do "". When was the last time you see economic advisers practising medicine and Public Health policy ? Or a president gave quackery apothecary advice on ingestion of Lysol or disinfectant to treat covid-19.

If you think it is OK, this is the result: 
US confirmed covid-19 cases-- 3,304,942.00, death 135,205 as of July 12, 2020 (JHU data) and the number are still surging.

One reporter asked Trump as he was heading to Walter Reed Medical Center, "" Do you think the covid-19 infection is under control ? "". Trump replied, : It is under control and it's coming down "".
If this is one of the questions appear on his Cognitive Test which he touted he A's it recently, it is for sure he failed this one miserably"
2020-07-13 14:46:31,"Gee, wouldn’t an issue that is affecting the entire nation benefit from a coordinated national response instead of each individual  US  healthcare worker encountering the same problems over and over?

We need leadership at the federal level.  Time to dump incompetence."
2020-07-13 15:01:09,"Certainly a bleak outlook considering the spread of COVID-19 is unabated especially in the younger population that has been care free and cavalier. The older population is receiving better care for COVID-19 and has fewer deaths than 3 months ago due to COVID-19. Deaths due to the other 10 leading causes like cancer and heart diseases in the same period has been 10 times that of COVID-19. The advances of our understanding of the disease progression from COVID-19 infections is enabling the reduction in the mortality rate of baby boomers and even seniors who have reached an average life span of human survival. 

That said, I estimate that  99.9% of humans on earth will have survived the pandemic due to the COVID-19 infection and the earth will continue to revolve around itself and around the sun. So there is a ray of hope that most of US will survive and get on with life well after the nano sized rascal menace is booted out of mother earth."
2020-07-13 14:55:41,"Trump is going to play all sorts of games in a desperate attempt to cling to the power he does not deserve to retain because he has been so reckless, negligent, and self-indulgent with it. The thing to do now is to be aware of the moves he makes but otherwise to ignore him and look to the near future when the people have removed him from power. In other words, he's done. All that really remains at this point is to vote against him. These days whenever anything negative comes out against someone he dislikes or wants to defeat or control, I just assume his hacks are behind it with some slimy lies, and move on with my day."
2020-07-13 14:57:06,"Fauci is saying stuff that Trump doesn't want to hear because Trump thinks it's bad for business, namely stay at home and spread out until we have a cure and a vaccination.

How about that Biden hiding in his basement? What a campaign tactic! The crazy thing is that it might win him the election. Need a running mate? How about Dr. Anthony Fauci?"
2020-07-13 14:58:23,"Let Trump discredit Fauci.  See what it gets him.  Yes, misinformation will be spread.  Trump's followers and some other percentage of citizens will suffer the consequences.  More people will die as a result.  A greater percentage of citizens will see through Trump's lies and do what is right to protect themselves and others; the biggest thing they can do is advocate for Democrats up and down the ticket, and vote on Nov. 3, 2020.  In the meantime there is nothing more we can do other than rebut the lies as they are spoken, and wait for Jan 20, 2021.  Trump, Trumpists and Trumpism know no bottom."
2020-07-13 14:58:33,"Dr. Fauci has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984. He has held that post under every president since Reagan. He is 79 years old and could easily retire to a life if leisure but chooses to continue to work not for himself but for the well being of the American people. Donald Trump is 74, has never held public office before and has never worked for the good of all Americans. It is he who should be forced to retire in November."
2020-07-13 15:08:44,"US deaths are down 80% since April.

COVID-19 has a 99.7% recovery rate."
2020-07-13 15:08:28,"So anonymous and unprincipled White House staffers are trying to distort Dr. Fauci's record regarding the Covid-19 pandemic response thus far for political purposes.  Since it's summer and we're all missing MLB, let's use a baseball analogy to describe the situation accurately.

2020-07-13 15:16:45,"Why does the NYT continue to print stories based on what Trump says? Honestly, why, at this point, would any of us possibly care what he says. Of course he is trying to undermine Dr. Fauci. How could we be surprised by this at this point? Why doesn't the NYT make what Dr. Fauci is saying the story? Seriously, STOP giving our resident facets what he wants, more air time, and start reporting the important information, like what Dr. Fauci says, with no word of Trump at all."

2020-07-13 15:16:46,"Back in April it became very clear the administration had completely mismanaged the nation’s initial response to the virus, and that it was necessary to finally shift gears from campaigning to actual governing. If trump had changed course his path to reelection would be smoother today.  Yet three months later his response to the coronavirus response debacle is to demand schools completely reopen without a national strategy; golf, tweet and plan rallies; and bury Dr Fauci. He had his chance to correct his initial failures but his narcissism, incompetence and sheer laziness have prevailed. Why anyone would want to play Russian roulette with this man for a second term is beyond comprehension."

We ignored the warnings about gathering in large groups over Memorial Day weekend, and, lo, cases of the virus spiked, just as epidemiologists predicted. Now we are poised to ignore more dire warnings, abetting the virus and further damning ourselves. If the virus were an intelligent entity, it couldn’t have chosen a more favorable environment than our shores."
2020-07-13 15:17:30,"Liars lie, that's what they do. If they can't find a lie to exploit, they alter the truth to make a lie. Dr. Fauci has from the start warned the American people about the dangers of this pandemic despite the Trump administration's attempts to downplay it. Who do you trust now? The man who is open and honest (Dr. Fauci) or the repeatedly proven crook in the White House (Trump). Wake up, Trump lovers. He only cares for you when you vote for him. All other times, you're just fodder for his empire."
2020-07-13 15:05:05,"Who are you going to believe:

Or...

• The president who stared at the sun?

Decisions, decisions."
2020-07-13 15:20:55,I see many folks buying into the narrative that all of Dr.Fauci’s recommendations are part of a power grab he is exacting by creating a panic and subjugating us through mask wearing.  Its tragic that another dedicated public servant is going to be destroyed by our corrupt president and his sycophants because he tried to save 100K Americans from the virus.
2020-07-13 15:25:38,"How typical of this administration to spend time and energy cherry picking Fauci's comments in an attempt to discredit him, rather than come up with a national plan and show some leadership.  If I were a teacher, especially an older one, I would not be heading back into a classroom any time soon.  The economy and our lifestyles are not going back to what they were any time soon.  But the incompetent Trump administration cannot get this through their simple little pea brains. They will continue to say everything is rosy. The mounting cases and deaths will say otherwise. And it is just unbelievable that many go along with the farce. Ask the 30 year old guy who went to a covid party and thought the virus was a hoax. Oh wait, you can't. He died."
2020-07-13 15:38:58,"Elections are approaching in November. At this time Trump should not have invited trouble to himself like this. Trump don't take good decisions, and if someone gives him good suggestions, he is so adamant that he won't accept that. I think he is spoiling his chances of becoming President for the second term because of his 'attitude'."

2020-07-13 15:39:25,"PUSH back on Fauci's criticism! Others in CDC have been co-opted to 'stay in line'. He has not, despite bullying and threats. The nation needs at least one 'official' medical voice that tells it like it is. It is our health that is at stake!"
2020-07-13 15:39:32,"I agree with the comment that COVID needs to be rebranded the Trump Virus. He is, by virtue of his lies, inaction and incompetence, responsible for this continuing carnage.

2020-07-13 15:30:33,"Making mistakes since the start of the pandemic and continuing to do so, trump and his administration are scapegoating Fauci because - unlike Fauci - they are capable only of mistakes.  

Unfortunately trump mistakes are extremely serious - causing grave illness with high personal and economic costs, not to mention too many deaths."
2020-07-13 15:31:24,"Trump cannot sue the virus, he cannot divorce the virus, he cannot declare bankruptcy with the virus. Trump’s life experiences in dealing with adversity will not work with this. 
He is trying to “divorce” Dr. Fauci. He is threatening schools with bankruptcy if they don’t open up in September. These actions are unhelpful. What we need is a problem solver, not a quitter."
2020-07-13 15:41:53,"The Fax machine spewing out piles of paper kind of says it all-- we are so behind in public health, federal planning, social culture, national resolve. Are officials also carrying pager/beepers? Meanwhile, the admin attacks Fauci and is once again pushing hydroxychloroquine.
To Trump's defense, almost any President would have struggled with the public health system we have in place.
To Trump's detriment, I can't imagine anybody doing a poorer job in every way possible."
2020-07-13 15:41:58,"So Dr. Fauci has been wrong in the past, especially before we had significant knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2virus. But he has revised his statements and recommendations as new information became available. That’s how science advances. 

Contrast that with Trump, who has been wrong even more often, and just doubles down on his errors, repeating and amplifying them. That is the mark of a fool."
2020-07-13 15:57:25,"Yeah but it’s not just the international students in America that is being affected by this. I am currently at my home country and would much prefer to stay here and take my classes online, with my family, until after the pandemic is over. If I do that, my visa will be cancelled, and I will have to reapply when and if my school decides to make classes in-person again. It’s absurd."
2020-07-13 15:57:59,"Trump intends to replace all foreign students (total market size $47 billion) with his supporters, quite a bit of whom not only lack, but could do with education.  Of any kind.  The MAGA set - particularly those that show up at his rallies - will then replace all high end labor for which the US economy has traditionally relied upon foreign students (programmers, scientists, physicians, educators, key writers, poets, musicians, journos what not).

Now if only Trump had a solution for the low end work such as farm, hospitality, and construction; i.e., have the MAGA set actually agree to work with their hands instead of living on government handouts, he could MAGA. He could throw out every single undesirable without a whit of consequence for the American economy.  I am sure he will unveil that plan after he is re-elected and replaced the justice system with his cronies, and have fellow republicans (starting with tax reformer Grover Norquist, and the religious right leaders) feed unfettered at the federal teat while preaching self-reliance, rugged individualism, and brotherhood of man.

We deserve this leader; but for us - how could he be possible?"

2020-07-13 15:46:44,"Mr. Trump's administration is acting as though its a TV show for entertainment and ratings, but with no real world consequences. No question that Mr. Trump is behaving like an actor according to a script written to maximize viewer enthrallment with episodes varied to sustain suspense, speculation about what will happen next, then surprising the audience with the unexpected drama, hooking them into following the hero, Mr. Trump, as he defies and conquers opponents, firing some, seducing and rewarding others.

This is what Mr. Trump knows best, imaginative contests, risk taking, profits enhancement, bluffing others, beguiling the media. Hollywood is his model, believable fakery, publicity the magic potion.

Covid to Mr. Trump is a necessary challenge to overcome, at length, numerous casualities essential for verisimmiliude. Cliff-hanging unknowns strategically deposited to engage consumer attention, hints of disaster at every turn, finally, though, a formulaic ending of the series, unavoidable election in November.

Lights up, the movie is over, leave the darkened theater for the sunlight outside. Head home momentarily charmed, then a headache, coughing, muscle ache, fever, surely no more than too much popcorn and soda."

Now we are seeing daily cases drop (gradually) while we continue to keep the feet on the brakes to push the R rate down to safer levels. Why doesn’t the NYY provide some more balanced reporting of this?  It would show that despite the chaos, some people are actually acting as a community to flatten the curve and might encourage others to do the same."

It's always been my philosophy that if someone is going to quote me, either quote me correctly or don't quote me at all.

Since March most of the country, especially here in the northeast dutifully followed his advice in order to ""bend the curve"" and prevent hospitals from being overrun. Had he instead focused on protecting the at risk cohort, like the nursing home residents responsible for nearly half of the deaths and a large percentage of hospitalizations I suspect president Trump would be paying more attention to his advice. Perhaps if Fauci had bothered to raise a fuss when governors Cuomo and Murphy ordered nursing homes to admit Covid positive patients and exacerbate the mortality and hospitalization rates in their states the families of he deceased might be coming to Fauci's defense. Instead of addressing that failure, Fauci chooses to berate young, healthy adults for daring to live their lives and demands what amounts to a perpetual shut down. After 4 months of being subjected to his ineffectual  demands, it's clear that president Trump isn't the only one not listening to him any more."

And let's continue to do everything possible to discourage, disrupt and expel students, scientists and doctors of foreign origin.  Let's also attack and maybe even end education since it contributes to rational and critical thinking and might therefore result in dissent from republican doctrine. Look at these hands!

It is not clear why the fact checkers at the Times allow the stories and headlines to say that the rule is new."

The Silver tongued Trump who was born on 3rd base with his silver platter in hand has found yet another issue to divide America and create dust to obscure reality and in the chaos, steal home - ours.

2020-07-13 16:28:41,"Kayleigh McEnany's defense of the administration's visa policy is predictably disingenuous. The ban preventing foreign students from taking fully online classes was originally set in place to prevent people from exploiting sham universities, like *ahem* Trump University, to gain a foothold the US. This policy is justifiable under normal circumstances, when bona fide colleges could safely offer in-person instruction. However, we are clearly not living under normal circumstances and evicting students during a pandemic serves no purpose other than to strong arm universities into reopening earlier than it is safe.

Oh and let's not forget that the administration previously announced that they would waive the in-class requirement for the duration of the pandemic. This unprompted reversal is precisely why they're getting sued."
2020-07-13 16:10:49,"This is the most mismanaged disease in the history of infection. Indeed it is horrifying to see that the loudest science gets attention over the most promising approaches. 
To rescue our nation, scientists and doctors need to band together, choose leaders and come up with a detailed plan of action for all. It's time for a covert operation to nudge science in the best direction for our survival. I am sure Democrat led states will follow any implementation and measures. At least there will be a standard, consolidated approach by the blue states. This plan should have the blessings of the Democrats in politics so scientists will not be bothered by this present callous and ineffective administration, or worse uneducated, misinformed public. Please do not include any current folks heading any task forces today....Dr. Redfield, Dr Birx and Dr Fauci comes to mind.

The rule until the pandemic was that foreign students could only take 1 on-line course, so it would help to explain why the administration's rule is incorrect in light of history prior to the pandemic.  How is it possible that the Mass AG doesn't even give a justification of her statement?

So, if Fauci in February had even said something he corrected later ( in the first days of a pandemic) so what.  He is a physician, a scientist and he reports data and information as it is known.    He is not a politician, he is not elected, he is an expert in his field.

But those few only put them on when conductor passes through and then take them off.  They do this time after time.

It's ridiculous that they don't have undercover MTA cops walking  the trains and literally tossing these miscreants off the train.

As far as I'm concerned, whenever I see someone either not wearing a mask or dangling one below their nose etc. I consider that person to be an arrogant ""super-spreader"" intent on doing me harm.

This is not a game.  It's a matter of health and safety and literally life and death.  I don't need to risk an infection while riding on a train or walking around town because some idiot won't wear a mask.

2020-07-13 16:51:57,"Politico reports that Trump forwarded tweets by former Game Show host Chuck Woolery asserting ""everyone is lying"" about the pandemic, and it's all cooked up to get Trump out of office.  This illustrates clearly Trump's mindset - and why he is out to get Dr. Fauci.  It's all to UNFAIR.  It was all supposed to just GO AWAY.   The fact Trump doesn't seem to grasp is that he cannot bully or wish this virus away - it's raging and is going to continue to rage until people grasp they need to take measures such as limiting social interactions and wearing a mask.  Overwhelmed hospitals in AZ, FL and TX are not ""lying"" about this situation.   I really do not feel sorry for the scofflaws who don't mask up and think going to Disney World is a great idea at the moment.  The problem is it impact everyone else - especially essential workers who cannot avoid these fools, or end up trying to save their lives.  Dr. Fauci's statements evolved with the situation and known facts about this new virus.  Trump's pronouncements haven't really varied  - he has never accepted the seriousness of this situation and all the browbeating and lying in the world isn't going to change things.  Only science based public policy with the cooperation of the American people will make a difference.  If we cannot or will not cooperate and take the measures recommended, primarily limited social interactions, good hygiene and wearing a mask, we still have many dark days ahead."

2020-07-13 17:30:00,"Perhaps someone can elude me. Why does the administration want to destroy university research in the US and its top reputation worldwide? This is a huge economic factor and an innovation driver, and it is not clear to me why an administration so focused on bringing back the economy doesn’t see this.

I am a research active faculty at a major university and this would mean that my research program (mainly funded with federal grants) is completely shattered, as my Ph.D. students would need to leave the country too if my university switches back to online instruction. As their are partly from middle east countries, they likely won’t be able to come back at all. My colleagues are in the same situation. We also have an MS program with mainly international students, which generates a significant revenue and will disappear in all likelihood, possibly leading to layoffs of faculty and staff.

The issue that some people refuse to honor or believe this because of propaganda does not make it a fault line, just like some people refusing to believe the earth is round fails to change the facts. It is too simplistic to make it part of the political divide, it is a small portion of sycophantic cult-like belief in a failing leader making a statement that makes it an issue."

The right in this country are simply ridiculously ignorant people who simply refuse to believe that the U.S. foreign policy since WWII has helped make this the safest and most prosperous era in the modern era. They see the world as out to take what they have and to deprive them of their rights so they are at war with everyone. Not people who have any security about knowing what to expect in the world as it happens to be.

Among his other failings, Trump is an isolationist, a totally insupportable position in today's world.

So put your GOP and MAGA ideologies away and do your part to save lives and get the economy open again.
2020-07-13 18:01:25,"The context about the foreign student visa lawsuit is that Republicans have been cutting funding to higher education ever since GWB.

in order to make up the shortfall while continuing their educational mission, universities have increased tuition and heavily recruited foreign students (who pay the highest tuition rate and are, therefore, profitable).

So now, Trump is cutting off the money supply to higher education, without replacing it with government support.  Because cutting taxes and xenophobia are more important than having robust education & research capabilities, at least for Republicans.

If you think America needs to be able to, for instance, be able to find a cure for a novel respiratory disease before the Chinese start selling us their cure...

Although “evidence” points to lower risk to children this is a NON-Negotiable. Already, Covid-19 is spreading from barhoppers & beaches to rest of population.

Re. the deportation threat to foreign students if only online classes are held, let’s use the Republican language of revenue and income stream. Typically, foreign students pay full price and particularly in STEM have much better credentials than U.S. students (as a result of our secondary school curriculum which doesn’t adequately prepare our kids for the rigor required). How will the financial aid and scholarships be funded to U.S. students if we deny access to the international students??

Imagine if instead of shoveling all of our money into the pockets of the rich, we invested in our educational infrastructure, not only protecting children and teachers while allowing schools to open, but also creating a massive stimulus in a big part of the construction industry.

We have to get the schools open. Wouldn't you agree with that?
We have to get them open. I think there is alot of politics going on.  I think they think they will do better if they keep the schools closed during election.

We wore face masks throughout the 16 hour flight and at both airports. When we touched down at Singapore’s Changi airport, we were taken in a bus to a hotel assigned to us for our mandatory 14 day quarantine. The costs of our hotel stay and a Covid swab test are borne by the government. 

We have a comfortable hotel room at the Fairmont with a great view. But we are not allowed to step out of our room. We get text messages from the immigration authorities at random times during the day. The texts contain a link that we click on to confirm our location. Is this intrusive? Yes, but we accept that it is necessary in these extraordinary times. It boils down to trust in government.

Can you imagine having an apartment lease, a car, and all that comes with living in a place and then having to go with such a short notice. Not only would you loose your deposit but also finding an airplane ticket would be very difficult, that is of course if your home country is even allowing flights in from the US, some aren’t even taking their own citizens.

We fast forward to early 2020.  The deaths are beginning to mount.  Instead of LBJ or Nixon attempting to convince us the deaths are collateral in the big picture and in time will be worth it.  Trump and his wrecking crew are apparently painting the same portrait using the blood of the dead due to his lack of leadership.  Only this time the deaths are collateral in light of the big issues-the economy, jobs and reelection, reelection being the most important to the “president”.

I dream that the US military recognizes the threat Trump presents to the nation and will decide that waiting for an election (which may never occur) is too risky. That the military, in coordination with the Secret Service, will place Trump under house arrest along with Pence, McConnell, Barr and the other perpetrators of this crime syndicate. Temporarily, the military will install Gen Mattis and Kelly to administer the government while they assemble a team to review each agency, each member of congress, and replace agency secretaries as they see fit.

I understand the risks but allowing a madman to continue unrestrained has even more risk. It is unlikely Mattis and Kelly will sell us out to the Russians or force policies that kill our kids. I believe these two marines can be trusted to return control to civilian government once the perpetrators are removed. I have no confidence that Trump & his henchmen will ever relinquish power."

2020-07-13 19:32:37,"California knows that teachers will strike if ordered back to in-person instruction in the midst of a pandemic. 

In the 27 right-to-work states where collective bargaining for teachers is illegal (and therefore striking is illegal), guess what? They’re still going to strike. Refer to what happened in 2018. Four of the five states where teachers went on strike were right-to-work states. Arizona was one of them.

Teachers are not healthcare workers. They didn’t go to college with the idea that they’d have a career requiring them to subject themselves to a deadly virus. If you think that teachers shouldn’t be able to strike over what the government is asking them to do, you obviously don’t value teachers.

We do not have enough testing in America. We also don’t have Clorox wipes, hand sanitizer, masks, classrooms with proper ventilation, or enough space for distancing. It’s not uncommon for the average public school restroom to lack soap in the soap dispensers. Teachers rely upon parents to supply these basic items. And no one can find these items at present. Sold out.

In addition to that, most schools don’t even have a school nurse. Will the teacher have to triage students who show symptoms when the itinerant nurse (who has 4 different schools to manage) is on the other side of the county?

Teacher strikes in right-to-work states will certainly happen if teachers are ordered back to dilapidated buildings with no cleaning supplies. And why on earth shouldn’t they?"

2020-07-13 21:15:22,"I wouldn't be surprised, in fact I suspect there's a high probability Trump will try to delay the election if he's double digit behind in the polls in October.

He'll blame the pandemic and force Democrats into court to stop him. Which of course would accomplish his intent anyway. Senate Republicans will back him up and Barr, Mnuchin and the judges will run interference.

Trump is in serious legal and financial jeopardy if he loses the protection of the presidency and those he's put in place to cover for him. He has no choice."

2020-07-13 21:27:56,"My wife and I had a wonderful expat life, living in many places in the USA, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.  Ten years ago, when I retired, my wife and I considered several states to retire in -  Texas, Florida, Arizona, California and the Carolinas - based on our lifelong hobbies of golfing, hiking and ocean sports.  

It was serendipity that we ended up in California.  Today, in our 70's, during the greatest pandemic in a century, we have a governor and most of our mayors who are acting responsibly listening to medical experts and diligently following healthcare guidelines to wear masks, socially distance and hunker down.  

We feel particularly sorry for retirees in Florida, Texas and Arizona, who are willing to sacrifice the old people to "".. reboot the Trump economy"".  We watch Govs. DiSantis (FL), Abbott (TX) and Ducey (AZ) muck about in those poor states, parroting the Trump line that everything is okay.  We talk to old friends retired in those states, who are afraid to let anyone to their door.  

So thank you, Governor Newsom, for trying to keep us old people alive.  We are all going to vote on November 3rd, for a candidate who cares about our wellbeing."
2020-07-13 21:33:47,"While I understand the public health concerns of opening schools, there is another side of this equation. Denying in-person schooling to impoverished families is catastrophic for children. The children, often of color, already go to schools that have significant resource issues due to the funding policies of schools in the US, which causes a significant achievement gap. Online education works great for upper middle class families with wealth and educated parents, who may also be working at home. These families have high speed internet and multiple devices to allow for this type of education. Low income families are living in income distressed homes where the parents most like need to work away from home to just to meet weekly bills. A loss of schools in these low income communities will have devastating long-term effects. Meanwhile, wealthy white families who can send there students to private schools will likely have high quality in-person education or superior online education if the school has to close for a period of time. Sending students laptops and school meals does not resolve this opportunity gap that will only be heightened by the nature of COVID-19 making running giant districts like LA United difficult."

2020-07-13 21:39:54,"The social and geographic complexity of CA is such that there is no simple ""reason"" for the present outbreak of Covid-19 to alarming levels.

It is likely true that the State simply opened up too soon after first being a leader in stay-at-home shutdowns.  As a part-time resident of LA, when I was last there I could sense that folks grew increasingly desirous of returning to the region's legendary sun-splashed, care-free, LaLa-land lifestyle.

Complicating the situation was that while there were outbreaks in some areas, they came at different times and were often geographically scattered.  There would be an outbreak in the Central Valley which proved of little concern to Orange County etc.

Further, most of the early CA cases had arrived from China.  They were actually relatively few and the early shutdown muted the impact.

But now, with more ""opening"" plus the spread of the more virulent ""European"" strain from East to West the situation is far different.

Right now we are back in NY and face a dilemma when to return to LA.  We know we'll face the need to quarantine upon coming back if we go there.  But at the same time, much of our lives is truly ""bi-coastal"".

It's almost like living in one house where there is a ""safe"" room and a ""dangerous"" one.  And those two keep switching.

We just hope that CA finds a way to tamp down the situation there as much as we also hope NY now ""stays the course"" and continues to beat the virus."

It’s sad to me that people remain unfulfilled in jobs they dislike because they’ve no other way of getting health insurance. Feels like a treadmill one can never get off."
2020-07-13 22:12:02,"What would be the ramifications of decoupling health insurance from employment? According to some quick research, almost 50% of Americans have employer-provided health insurance (pre-COVID-19 figures). Another 20% are on Medicaid and another 15% are covered under Medicare.   That leaves only 15% who seek insurance on the open market place, a relatively small percentage. That's perhaps the reason Obamacare was not the resounding success it was hoped to be. What if those 15% ballooned to 65%, i.e., those who would no longer have employer-provided health insurance, but would now buy on the open market, just like buying car insurance? The sheer volume of demand would lead to much greater competition, more choices and lower premiums, assuming market forces can be trusted. Employers would no longer have to deal with the expense and responsibility of offering health insurance as a fringe benefit, but pay that as cash compensation instead, which would help employees help purchase medical insurance. The health insurance would be portable and completely independent of employment. Just as employers already require things like valid driver's licenses, they could require proof of health insurance as prerequisite of employment, which would serve as an incentive for folks to purchase coverage.  I'd like to see an in-depth analysis of how such an arrangement could work or not."

They will have no choice but to refuse to pay on those claims to the hospitals, perhaps by declaring bankruptcy.  And that will kill the cash flow that hospitals and other healthcare institutions were counting on.

They'll pass on the bills to patients (or the patient's estates) which virtually no one will be able to pay.

This is a failed and immoral country. Other people around the world take for granted their cheap or free healthcare and pity us.

No. So whose responsibility is it that 5.4 millions are without health insurance when previous to the shut down they all had insurance through their employers?

Most Americans surveyed about the unemployment benefits think that getting workers back to work will be difficult and that will cause a domino effect including loss of health insurance. Reopening safely and getting employees back to work with the same previous private health insurance is the way forward. Those who do not get their jobs back need to be served by Medicaid. The US tax payers spend 1 billion dollars a day or 2365  dollars annually on Medicaid. No justification for not managing health care for all those who are uninsured. Universal health care should be for all those who have no Medicare for all above 65 and private insurance for those who have employee coverage and Obamacare to those who can afford it and do not have Medicare for all above 65 and private insurance.

While the devastated industrialized world responded with efficient systems of government sponsored universal health care, the United States responded with a system of employment based health insurance.   It worked well with minimal unemployment and employers willing to provide coverage.  

Today, however, unemployment is an increasingly serious problem.  Though the quality of health care in the US remains superb on an individual basis, simply because of insufficient access for millions of us no longer covered by our employment based health insurance, the national indicators of health suffer - and the United States suffers for it.  We suffer to the point that, despite professional and technologic superiority, our health status in the United States is the worst of all industrialized nations; and it’s worsening daily.  For this dubious stature, we spend far more on health care than any country - industrialized or otherwise. 

This Coronavirus pandemic is now a global disaster greater than WWII.  Despite highly advanced science and technology,  the United States is not doing well compared to nations with national health systems - setting scary records in both job losses; and therefore record losses in health insurance coverage.  This health care war against the Coronavirus points glaringly to our urgent need for government sponsored universal health care."
2020-07-14 00:49:14,"So, our insurance system, even post-ACA, has left another 1%-2% of our population without coverage, down from 91%. 

That's just peachy.  Against 99% to 100% for the rest of the developed world.

About 1% to 2% of our now roughly 10% uncovered can thank the 13 red states for not expanding Medicaid.

Much of the maybe 8% remaining don't have affordable coverage because of serious weaknesses in the ACA from the start, from the Democrats  These need to be repaired fully, especially now that Single Payer appears politically impossible.

The ACA affordabilty issues revolved around deficiencies called the ""subsidy cliff"", the ""family glitch"", high copays, and some others.

One of my favorite, generally ill-publicized issues that I like to point out, is that much of the ""coverage"" that the country now counts as coverage in the statistics are forms of Medicaid, including ACA expanded Medicaid.   (Referring to non-long-term-care Medicaids.  The ordinary medical ""coverage"" people have.)

In at least 10 states, include blue MA, NJ, and MD, any Medicaid coverage, including ACA expanded Medicaid, for people 55 and older, is subject to Medicaid estate recovery.

That means its a loan for medical expenses.  Bills are paid for now, but have to be paid back the estate.

It's quite the bomb for some people, especially now having been switched to Medicaid due to Covid.

(Currently, this last issue is covered, with references for soundness, on the Wikipedia ""Medicaid estate recovery"" article.)"
2020-07-14 00:55:57,"These headlines are too simplistic. Yes, that many lost their coverage, but some were able to qualify for Medicaid and some could go on individual coverage with a subsidy through the ACA (the qualifying event would be “loss of coverage”.) Also, even if these workers had coverage through their employers in the first place, how much were employers contributing to the monthly premium, and how rich were the plans? Did these workers qualify for some version of COBRA or state continuation? How many were able to jump on their spouse’s or their parents’ group plans? In some cases, losing coverage through one’s employer can be advantageous, notwithstanding the loss of income.

For a multitude of reasons, US healthcare and health insurance is an embarrassment, an utter failure, and in some instances, criminal. It is much too complex, and worse—it’s just plain depressing to even think about—which can prevent people from fully understanding, pursuing, or navigating their options. Universal healthcare is an absolute must."

They restrict pharmaceutical prices to about $250 per year and coverage cost about $100 a month before subsidies. In total under that private model we are talking about a $1,000. Whereas in the US we are talking about $10,000. However I have never heard anyone say okay, we will actually adopt this. They just use it to avoid supporting Medicare for All. 

I favor a Medicare for All option. I had a close friend that committed suicide because he was worried his medical bills (he had private insurance from employer) would bankrupt his family. GoFundMe is a perfect illustration of why we need Medicare for All. Democrats have been able to skate by on how grotesque Trump is personally but Pelosi and Biden will be just as reluctant to do anything that tackle costs because he means reducing power, money, and influence of powerful moneyed classes, which GOP & Dems aren’t interested in."

He's bright and direct and it's clear he likes people. 
When this pandemic was but a whisper, he and his colleagues around the world went to work on a vaccine. 
Before Trump even knew what to have on his cheeseburger that day, Dr. Fauci was at work for humankind. 
Trump and the GOP pandemic pandemonium failed us. 
Not Dr. Fauci. 
Trump and troops were still licking their impeachment wounds when the Covid 19 pedal hit the metal. 
Every medical mind of worth cautioned that we were losing precious weeks, then months, and now we are reaping a virus out of control. 
Fauci warned us this would happen. But with no federal leadership or planning, and not enough PPE or testing supplies, and weak GOP governors under Trump's thumb, we are destined to be under the lash of covid 19. 
My question is, will there be enough of us left to benefit from the so-called herd immunity? Or will there just be animals safely crossing highways forever more?"

Medical Care Restoration Act diminishes defensive medicine, encourages learning and patient care and restores the non monetary rewards to the practice of medicine and surgery. Physicians will have to earn their keep but can restore the honor and affection and effectiveness of their profession and all those persons associated with healing.

A common misconception is confusing lack of insurance with lack of access to healthcare.  Access is the key issue.  People have lost insurance, but many if not most may still have access to care without having to pay for it.

Since NYT is located in a city with over 30 Community Health Centers and 11 public hospitals including the storied Bellevue Hospital (on which the TV show New Amsterdam is loosely based) would be mention in the article.  Urban Health Plan is in the South Bronx.  Jacobi Hospital is in the Bronx.  Prior to the ACA, NYC took care of 450,000 people without insurance.

These community health centers and public hospitals see people without any insurance at all.

Please put in your articles related to those without insurance that for many in most if not all large metro markets and smaller ones there are community health centers and public hospitals for example, Chicago has the great historic Cook County Hospital.

A key issue which politicians need to address is that these community health centers and public hospitals are underfunded and that funding has a great impact.

NYT, please remind readers that lack of insurance is not the same as lack of access to healthcare and remind them that we need to make as a priority a huge several billion dollar funding increase for these community health centers and public hospitals."

The only way to truly remedy this is either adopt universal price fixing for all services/procedures (like in japan), or have a public option (england's nhs) where gov't can control prices within their own network of hospitals.  Obviously neither will ever happen because, in the US, both approaches make too much common sense and there's too much money by private hospitals to lose.  So, we'll literally never figure it out.  Obamacare is the most realistic framework within our existing system because the individual mandate was to encourage the young and healthy to enroll to offset the costs of those with pre-existing conditions to be covered, but republicans and the mis-informed have all made a stink about it and dropped the individual mandate.  Repulicans broke obamacare and conventiently complain about how broken it is.  Honestly, I hope all the critics of obamacare one day realize how vulnerable and unafforable it is to not have employer based health insurance.  Seems like these people only realize these things once it happens to them (cough*covid19)."

The Trump administration, along with some soon to be replaced House and Senate members, have consistently lied and downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic, resulting in more than 130,000 unnecessary deaths in the US. 

I think Dr. Fauci should resign immediately and serve as a consultant regarding the pandemic for the Biden campaign. This action would also free him to conduct more media interviews. The virus will not be gone by January and President Biden will want to surround himself with all of the best scientists and medical experts as the country works to vanquish COVID-19 and be better prepared for the next pandemic. President Biden can then hire Dr. Fauci back in his current position."

If we are to ever succeed in booting out the nano sized rascal menace from earth we need to adopt some simple hygienic practices in addition to masks, without shutting down businesses and without waiting long for a deployable vaccine. 

There is no uniformity in mask wearing in the USA. Home made and Designer masks have mushroomed and spread like wild fire just as fast as the surge of Coronavirus 2 COVID-19. A large proportion of US residents just are not serious about wearing a proper mask properly. I have been seeing people pulling their T-shirts in closed spaces like super market and gas station convenience stores over their noses to convince others around that they care as much about wearing a piece of cloth. There is a misconception that one cannot breathe even if one wears a proper mask. The kind of material used for making masks can be a legitimate concern. If one wears a mask that is made out of synthetic material that does allow air to pass freely through then it is better to just buy a commercial mask from a pharmacy.

Getting another deeply challenging cognitive test? The media will give him a pass yet again. No questions asked, no pressure at the presser, and another scam perpetrated. Somehow we deserve what we get with Trump."

No doubt Trump chose a hospital visit to veterans for this latest act of showmanship to make the act seem grander, generous and acceptable to his fragile ego. Real leaders have been wearing masks in public for weeks/months, and cheerleading for the rest of us to do the same. Trump is not a real leader. He just plays one (badly) on TV. 

On the brighter side, perhaps by finally acquiescing to wearing a mask, Trump will inspire his base to do the same. That would be good for all of us."
2020-07-12 16:27:47,I hope the real reason he wore a mask is because Walter Reed staff said he couldn't come otherwise.  He's in such deep trouble with soldiers for doing nothing about Russian bounties his staff would want him to make an obligatory and sanctimonious pilgrimage (all fake).

Oregon, like other states, continues to see a rise in cases, but the really troubling part is that most of the increase is occurring in counties with generally sparse population but with major agricultural processing sites. The rise in effect on the most vulnerable isn’t reflected in the daily counts."

The only way NYC bent their curve was massive action. I just don’t see how cases will go down in Florida at this point. What is it going to take?

To anyone who says it’s the death rate that matters more, ok sure, you are starting to see that rise in Florida now. So at what point is that not ok?"
2020-07-12 17:17:49,"With regard to the FL setting the single day case record, that may be technically true however the headline is very misleading.  Those 15K cases were the result of 99K tests - a positivity rate of 15.5%, the lowest I've seen in 2 weeks and far below the 24+% positivity rate that I believe was the case when NY reported it's 12K one day total.

I think this is the lowest positivity rate for both FL and S FL that I've seen in 2 weeks and is, hopefully a small step in the right direction.

That headline, though technically correct, does not serve the public well.

Those that are opening need to get funds to fix their ventilation systems  to prevent the dispersal of all diseases now that we know that many schools have poor systems.  Private schools are private.  They should not get any aid.  The people who wanted private schools can pay for them.  As for Trump and the mask,why is that even worth commenting on?  Congressman and reporter have more important things to work on that when and Trump is wearing a mask though I think Trump should watch a few reruns of the lone ranger.  How about dealing with DACA before the election and get it settled?  That is Congress's job, not the president's.  While I am at it, Congress needs to forgo any vacations until this issue and the problems resulting from the pandemic are completed.  There are a lot of unemployed people who need help.  All members in both houses can meet in DC with masks.  Maybe that will give them more incentive to get the work done.

2020-07-12 17:34:52,"We cannot address a real natural phenomenon as if it is a problem of perception. 

The first fact to accept is that it’s threat of severe medical problems from this illness is lower than many other pathogens but that it spreads easily and the infected often show mild or no symptoms. That means that the law of large numbers guarantees that big spread means catastrophic amounts of severely ill people. 

The second fact is that not knowing who is ill leaves controlling the spread to shutting down social interactions and the disruption of all aspects of life. It means greatly diminished economic activities by individuals and private enterprises. It means diminished revenues to support public services.

The third fact is that this is an international pandemic and using centralized authority is the most efficient means of addressing it. Resources are limited because of the interruption of normal ways of generating new wealth, so wealth must be expended carefully to minimize the long term costs from deficits and scarcity driven inflation. 

We are in this together no matter what are are attitudes and preferences, and we will harm ourselves by letting politics affect how this pandemic is addressed."

1) Fear of spreading the virus to hospitalized members of the military? (Unlikely,  given his  his repeatedly having turned his back on our fighting forces).  

2) Giving in to the repeated begging and pleading on the part of his White House staff  to show some leadership regarding the pandemic? (Also unlikely, in light of his oft-stated claim that the worst is over and that the country will return to normal tomorrow, at the latest).

3) Or perhaps out of his brilliant idea, as only a stable genius like himself could concoct, that this gesture of good faith will help him win re-election, strengthening his base by bringing doctors, scientists and traditionally non-voting bank robbers into the fold? (Plausible).

Despite Mr. Trump's ostensibly impure motives for helping resolve the mask debacle, even if based on a single use, let's give credit where it's due. And then let's vote him out of office in November."

Aren’t the predicted 50k lives that could be saved in the next few months by social distancing and mask wearing worth saving? That is the question leadership should be asking, because so far the answer is a resounding “NO.”"

Whether by AK-47 or Covid-19, students (and their families), teachers (and their families), and school staff (and their families) put at risk to fully open all public schools are nothing more than collateral damage, expendable in their eyes. Whether to serve their belief that any and all weapons should be available to everyone without restriction, or to serve trump’s desperate efforts to save the economy he destroyed, lives will be put in harm’s way.

The study also shows near equivalent hazard indexes for men as with race and ethnicity combined. But what do we read or hear?  Silence.

Many other governors / states followed suit, imperiling both the health and wealth of US citizens.

Now Trump and his lackeys are in a rush to reopen schools,  already notorious incubators for cold, pink eye, flu, etc. And they want to do so under CDC guidelines revised to make school reopening easier and quicker, not safer and more protective of the health of the students, the faculty, and their families and communities.

Mandatory masks and social distancing. Close bars, restaurants, beaches, theaters. No groups over 5. 

This is all President Trump’s fault. And Republican governors. We could have done this months ago, and opened MUCH more cautiously.

This will not end until we as a country take the necessary steps or there’s an effective vaccine. 

The pandemic really should be the end of the Republican Party. It won’t be - the  party will emerge very damaged from the 2020 election- but it should be.

His mismanagement will condemn Florida’s citizens to the high likelihood of illness, disability and possible death, not to mention the real prospect of a dysfunctional economy that will cause economic distress throughout the state.  The Governor lacks the leadership skills, political independence and medical knowledge to successfully manage a public health crisis; he is well beyond any measure of ability to protect his citizens from the health and economic consequences of this pandemic.  He should leave and turn over all public health decisions to a trained professional, perhaps a physician with expertise in infectious disease and experience combating pandemics."

Most notably, there were 11 members of the same family that contracted H1N1 in December 2019 while visiting Disney World from South Carolina.  One of the members became seriously ill and was in an induced a coma.  This was never reported by the Florida health department nor Disney world.

Words also can kill.  CNN reported a 30 year old covid patient in Florida who said, on his death bed, the virus is not a hoax. He went to a ""covid party,"" hosted by a covid positive person to check if the virus was a hoax.   

I take the words of this very unfortunate covid victim in the same spirit as I do Yul Brynner's posthumous message, from the grave, to America. When he died of tobacco related lung cancer in 1985, Yul Brynner was at the height of his fame on Broadway as the king in ""The King and I."" His booming voice in the alpha male role was most impressive. However, the latter half of the 20th century was also a time of intense confrontation between the lies of Big Tobacco and science. The tobacco industry fought to discredit the overwhelming evidence against its lucrative products. 

So there was need for Yul Brynner's warning. He recorded a message  against smoking; the tobacco - cancer link is not a hoax. His message was played extensively on TV the year after his death. I still remember the multiple emotions in his voice as he warned us all against his fate. I'm still sorry a live was lost due to lies told to us."

Generations have had extended periods of closings of schools and they made it through. This is about vote getting and money and not your children."
2020-07-12 18:40:41,"I worry that DeVos has something far more sinister as her motive: 

She clearly wants to destroy public education in the country in favor of for-profit/private schools that form the basis of her wealth.   

So:  she can insist on opening public schools, let kids, teachers, and staff get sick, then claim that the public schools are part of the problem, so do away with them, provide no federal funding, and demonize those who believe in a public education system."

By then, they'll have had either 10.8 million or 15 million infections. I guess then we find out whether herd immunity really works (herd immunity apparently doesn't stop the infections; it just slows the rate.)

I wonder how long it will take Desantis/Trumpworld to realize that's something they probably don't want to attempt?"

I was crossing our local bridge after takeout breakfast. Four twenty-somethings were gathered near the middle of the span in the narrow walkway enjoying some local bud. 

I was walking toward them, when one of the young ladies looked at me and shouted playfully: ""No crossing, no mask, no room for social distancing!"" To which I replied: ""That's right, no breathing either."" They burst out laughing. I passed them on the pedestrian walkway, no problem. 

There's the election in a nutshell. Rural people are busy living their lives; 'citidiots' are trying to figure out how to breathe.

I’m not referring to the fact that there’s another 10 or 15 cases for every confirmed case.  NY Times...please understand that the country has hit its capacity to process Covid Tests in lab.  What we are reporting on a daily basis is the amount of tests processed that were taken nearly 10 days ago.  We are NOT reporting the actual tests from the day prior as the reporting would have us believe.  They process more Florida cases on Thursday Friday and Saturday so it makes it look like a severe rise toward the end of the week.  Sunday is the lowest processing day.  In other words the trend is not as bad as being reported today and not as good as you will report tomorrow.  Clearly Florida did not process 98k tests yesterday as you would have us believe.  If we are to use confirmed cases as a proxy, look at 7 day trends.  The other day, NY times reported which states are over testing and under testing.  If we do not figure out how to process more tests in the labs, testing will become useless as it almost takes longer to get test results back versus how long it takes to recover from the virus.  Isn’t that the real story????"

Daytona Beach, for example, is opening up its bandshell for concerts this week, and Sea World and Universal Studios opened several weeks ago. Disney opened yesterday. Tourists clearly bring more than money with them. And despite mask mandates in many municipalities, they are virtually unenforceable because no $10/hr cashier is willing to risk an altercation with a possibly armed, oblivious fool. Governor DeSantis, ever the Trump sycophant, has downplayed this virus and played the blame game for MONTHS.... Sadly, I just had to cancel plane reservations for several relatives from NJ who were to attend my son’s upcoming (?) September wedding. We all expected this to be much more under control by now, but my relatives, who lived through the worst of the virus in NJ, are now too terrified to come to Florida, because in NJ,  cases  have dwindled to a couple hundred per day, while in Florida, we have more daily cases now than 99 percent of COUNTRIES on this planet do each day.

Why is nobody discussing the lethal role of unfiltered, recycled, dehumidified air in the Sunbelt???

Lots of pictures of breezy southern beaches soaked in powerful UV light that kills the virus in 30 seconds...

...but while beaches themselves are very safe, as soon as you need toilet facilities, a shower, a drink, food, a shop or a room, you'll be stepping into a lethal refrigerator, just like a dangerous meat-packing plant.

Foreigners are shocked how any interior space in an American summer is ice-cold.  In the past we thought about the environmental costs and the respiratory tract challenge, but now there's a much bigger worry.

Your unfiltered airconditioning also dehumidifies the constantly recycled air, so that the virus-laden air in most interior spaces, as on a cruise ship, constantly gets more potent and deadly, with no opening windows to dilute the noxious vapour.

To me this largely explains the current surge in the Sunbelt, and I'm amazed not to have seen ANY  discussion in US or foreign media - I've only found obscure research papers addressing the obvious threat.

Yes, wear decent masks that filter out 98% of virus particles - NOT bandanas (30% filtration) and ill-fitting thin surgical masks (60%).

But much more importantly *put filters on all those constantly humming AC units*, dripping onto the sidewalks.

The HEPA material used in vacuum cleaners would eliminate not only small carrier droplets and aerosols, but nearly all virus particles too!"

Trump spent as much time on this Disease as he does on his golf games, twitter feed, Fox News Interviews, his constant attacks on Democrats, Republicans, Black Lives Matter, his grievances than just maybe, there could be some form of progress.  To applaud him for wearing a mask one time seems redundant to all issues, He needs to grow up and take the position of a leader seriously or just leave, take his private jet, his family, and move closer to his friend Putin. every day COVID gets stronger and the US gets weaker.

In the early 1940s, our country was able to respond to a global threat and make military equipment at a rapid rate. 

Why didn’t the Trump Administration, that likes to claim to have made us great again,  do a similar push for American made PPE and testing components to meet the demand of our nation at the start of 2020? Why aren’t there enough masks for everyone who boards a plane in this country to get a clean N95 mask for the flight? Why aren’t there enough masks to guarantee every school kid and teacher can have one this fall? Why aren’t air filtration systems receiving upgrades everywhere?

All I have seen is denial, a firmly held wish that COVID would magically disappear, leading to our hitting these new, devastating numbers of cases almost as unprepared as we were the first time around, and a push to undo health care coverage for millions of Americans. 

If that’s making America great, I feel like Inigo Montoya in the Princess Bride, as he responds to Fezzik, “I do not think that word means what you think it means.” Or in this case, I guess I’d need to ask how millions of sick Americans makes us great?"

The Miami Herald has a photo gallery of his time in Miami, and  a story of his visit to Broward Hospital.  Trump was not wearing a mask when he left the plane on landing, at Broward Hospital, and at the public meetings he attended.  At Broward Hospital he shook hands with a staff member, thereby violating safe practices for social distancing.  Some photos show him unmasked close to other parties who are also unmasked. At the public briefings, his seat was isolated from others, and many  of those in attendance are shown with masks.  So others followed safety protocols at those meetings, even if Trump was unmasked.  So Trump's mask photo is ""fake news"" to use his phrasing.  He was in a Covid-19 hot spot, unmasked, indoors, in a hospital and in a meeting with more than just a few people.  Trump placed himself and the people near him at risk.  If he does repeatedly, as he is prone to do, then with near certainty he will become another positive case.

Ms. Galvani's study indicates that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients may play a huge role in spreading COVID-19.  In this 3-minute interview, she discusses schools and whether she will likely send her children to school in the fall.  Ms. Galvani advocates for contact tracing and efficient, extensive testing.  Please take 3 minutes and listen to this important interview.

2020-07-12 19:46:49,Should we also take in to account the Florida Health Department has been intentionally under reporting or outright changing their numbers to appear lower for at least two months now. What’s worse is based off these practices it would not be unreasonable to believe that the numbers of deaths in Florida are far beyond what numbers are being shared. It’s leading people to believe less deaths are occurring which is most likely another lie with far reaching and dire consequences including mass delusion that the virus is somehow now less dangerous then it was in April.
2020-07-12 19:21:18,"So President Trump decided to wear a mask to a hospital?  Long overdue.  As usual it's all too little - and far, far too late.  

The good news is he was rather pleased with his appearance, and thought he looked rather good in a mask - ""like the Lone Ranger"".  Except that the Lone Ranger's mask is completely different: it covers the top half of the hero's face not the bottom, i.e. it surrounds the eyes not covers the nose and jaw.  

Instead, the mask our President was wearing was essentially the same as that worn by men being pursued by the Lone Ranger, men desperate to hide their identity, i.e. crooks & thieves.  No comment, right?"
2020-07-12 19:34:55,"Over in the land of the free and the home of the brave the essential businesses to open first amidst the worlds worst infection are: Bars, restaurants, hotels, casinos, gyms, nail and beauty services, and of course amusement parks. Very soon you can go on a Corona Carnival Cruise too, as long as you stay in US waters and harbors. 

The world is in disbelief. It was predictable some large nations like Russia, Brazil and India would somehow fail the pandemic response, but the fall of the US was not in the cards. At least not a few years ago."
2020-07-12 19:46:02,"One of the issues apparent today with the news of increased infections is the ability of the health care providers to accommodate these new cases should they need care.

How long can the nurses, doctors and EMT people sustain themselves in this pandemic.

The country will shut down again..but, by states as the deaths increase.  

Lastly, those governors and especially Trump are directly responsible for the deaths of so many...it simply did not have to be this way..we had the time..we say it coming with Europe being infected..they handled it a different way and now their countries are essentially open.

If someone dies in your family or permanently ""wounded"" by the virus...you now know who to blame."
2020-07-12 19:50:27,We live in a grim reality where the president wearing a mask is considered an act of leadership.
2020-07-12 20:04:30,"We have to see a state(s) try to operate openly with the pandemic. Only when the toll becomes overwhelmingly devastating will Republicans finally get serious. They only learn through experience. They don’t do well learning from theory or past experience of others. 

Some state will absolutely destroy itself before this is over. In addition to Texas, Florida and Arizona, don’t forget “freedom” states like Idaho, Alabama, Arkansas, S. Carolina, Missouri and Oklahoma are also attempting to ignore the virus. 

It’s really sad. Historians will look dimly on this era of America. A certain generation is going to go down ver unfavorably for the way they have led the country. 

By the way, where are Liberate protesters with their bushmaster AR-15 and Don’T Tread on Me flags demanding restrictions be lifted in Texas or Florida?  I guess that’s type of protest is only for Democratic Governors........."
2020-07-12 19:20:12,"If the GOP has to hold a big indoors no-distancing convention somewhere, Florida sounds like the least-damaging place to do it.

I think that Florida has done an OK job of isolating its elderly. How much longer can it protect them?"
2020-07-12 19:21:46,"About the mask, Trump’s biggest worry is that he might not look good. Reality check: like many old and fat people, the expiry date on looking good has passed a long time ago. With a shuffling gait and difficulty to walk down stairs, he should be glad that he can still golf using a golf cart. Be thankful for little things in life, especially later on. Moving to Florida was a thoughtful move. Lots of great retirement communities over there. 
About his claiming a high score on the mental test, I would not brag about this so much. No doctor recommends such a test to his patient unless certain behaviour has been noticed, usually by a family member. Hum, Melania?"
2020-07-12 19:54:19,"I have to admit I find it a bit odd how the media reports the daily Covid numbers as ""breaking a record"" and such.

Make it sound almost like a competition where you try to outdo the ""old record""!

Anyway the FL numbers are sobering indeed.  I noted you listed Orlando County as among the ""hot spots"".  And yet Disney World there just ""reopened""?

Simply amazing how people will literally risk their lives for transient entertainment opportunities.

The fact that Americans cannot seem to even temporarily alter their lifestyles and deny themselves amenities for even a short time such as during this Covid crisis is scary indeed.

If we cannot deal with a temporary alteration now -- how will be ever cope when we have to permanently adjust to drastic climate change?

American society has taken hedonistic individualism to its extreme absurdity."
2020-07-12 16:06:13,"Well, it’s Sunday and my state of South Carolina set ANOTHER record for covid deaths yesterday!  And all our Governor did this week to try to reverse the disaster HE created by reopening back in APRIL !!!  was to issue an order saying you can’t go out and get smashed in bars any LATER than 11:00 at night.  I guess he thinks the virus only works the night shift.  Thanks, gov."
2020-07-12 16:12:07,"Three months and 100,000 deaths late, Donald Trump finally ""masks up."" But is he willing to make what may be the best way to prevent the transmission of novel coronavirus mandatory? It's too late for ""what if's,"" but not too late for ""what now."" He can't have it both ways in asking and bullying states to reopen their schools without providing the funding and guidance to make it have a chance to work. Sadly, we know the answer already as he's once again attacked the nation's premier public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, forcing its equally sad, compliant Director, Robert Redfield, MD., to water them down to bland ""recommendations"" thus greatly enhancing the risk of a further surge in the virus even worse than the one currently setting records. That Redfield refuses to warn the nation of the impending peril and to resign in protest and with Dr. Anthony Fauci sidelined it means that we may soon see yet another, more deadly round of the truly toxic Trump leadership that will prove fatal to thousands and to the economy as well."
2020-07-12 16:18:11,"Trump’s vanity is pathological. I’m not saying anything new, but it really is just astounding. Instead of even humble bragging, saying something like, “wearing a mask is the very least I can do, we should all be wearing masks, and as President it is my duty to set an example for the nation,” he instead goes with, “I looked like the Lone Ranger.” He wastes opportunities, he wastes resources, and most tragically, he wastes lives."
2020-07-12 16:53:52,And Disney thinks opening Disney world was appropriate?
2020-07-12 16:55:02,"Florida’s Governor: “If people go to Home Depot and Walmart, people can go to school!”

Yea, people don’t usually go to Home Depot and Walmart for 7 hours at a time, 5 days a week...."
2020-07-12 20:20:07,Trump and the GOP succeeded in making America the greatest loser in the fight against a deadly worldwide pandemic.
2020-07-12 19:18:01,The reality of COVID-19 is slowly becoming apparent to more deniers. Please wear a mask and practice social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 will not magically disappear.
2020-07-12 20:18:19,"This virus reveals the true nature of every person, leadership and/or country."
2020-07-12 20:25:49,"Florida broke records for the number of new coronavirus cases in one day.  DisneyWorld reopened the same week.  Then last night Fox TV featured a neuroradiologist who blamed the surge in new cases across the US primarily on Black Lives Matter protests and proximity to the Mexican border. 

The President threatened to withhold federal funds from schools that do not reopen.  Then, when asked this morning about the plan for reopening schools safely, the Secretary of Education said each school must have one.

Yesterday, better than four months into this pandemic, the President of the United States wore a mask in public for the first time.  Then he bragged he looked like the Lone Ranger.

How many things are wrong with this picture?"
2020-07-12 20:29:06,"Trump wears a mask in public for the first time. Who cares? At this point, he is no longer relevant. To anything."
2020-07-12 20:34:59,"It’s high time for something be done about Covid-19. We need a national strategy here. The numbers of people getting sick are rising exponentially and the death rate is increasing, too. The problem is Trump will do nothing to curtail this virus. We need help! 
Remember in November."
2020-07-12 20:35:58,"Disneyland opening in a pandemic is a good image of America falling apart.  A magical kingdom full of fantasy, wishful thinking, and disease."
2020-07-12 20:27:04,"I'm stunned to find myself in a ""war zone"" in Florida where going to the supermarket is scary because 1 out of 59 people are inflected with coronavirus, where dinner with friends ends up with screams of ""I cannot believe you will vote for that man"" (both red & blue), and I get concerned calls from Hong Kong, South Africa, and Italy because I'm the one in a dangerous spot. I feel the American Dream is broken and I've yet to see a clear path forward"
2020-07-12 20:36:10,"The Donald had about 70 days to proactivly confront the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. Far worse than then and likely far worse the day after tommirrow.tomorrow. Today the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos stated — ""There's nothing in the data that suggests kids being in school is any way dangerous... "". It is difficult to understand what these people are doing and trying to do. Perhaps ""making up"" their own version of reality, a version contrary to history and knowledge. Whatever they do, other than doing nothing, the situation will worsen and with worsening the nation's prospect for a better tommorrow will fade. The situation is remarkable, our ""leaders"" reacting as if the situation is not severe. In the 17th century, plague doctors wore face masks with a long, beak-like protrusion. ""Herbs were enclosed in the mask, and there were two nostril holes near the nose to allow the wearer to breathe."" These masks are contained in the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hermonius Bosch, circa 1500 AD. If the status quo is maintained by the those we selected to lead, the mask may become pervasive."
2020-07-12 20:41:11,"There is no other choice:

Those feeling strong enough about the need to be tested should stay home and self-quarantine while waiting for the results.  Those testing positive must self-quarantine for 14-days, staying in their homes avoiding all others and then be re-tested before exiting quarantine."
2020-07-12 20:45:10,"Unfortunately it seems that the USA will show the world how this virus behaves when no actual measures are taken to stop it from spreading. It is unbelievable to me, living in one of the most hit areas in Italy, how it can be a subject of political debate whether to wear a mask or not."
2020-07-12 20:40:48,"At this point, do we even need politicians?"
2020-07-12 20:48:06,"I recently took a trip by car from upstate New York to a Midwestern state.  My conclusion: vaccine or bust.  I was appalled at the numbers of people lingering in indoor spaces at service stations and grocery stores without masks.  I fear most are either just too ill-informed or too lazy to do the right thing...even when it's a modest inconvenience.  It was really discouraging.  Even if we had a President with a clue, large swaths of this country just aren't going to sacrifice for the greater good."
2020-07-12 18:41:54,...and of course 45 simply NEEDED to be surrounded by ‘his’ military men in uniform to confirm his manliness while wearing a mask.
2020-07-12 19:59:55,"""I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place.”  Donald Trump

Gee, really?  ""They have a time and place""?
You mean like EVERYTHING in life...and death?"
2020-07-12 20:40:27,"Who does Trump think he's fooling by suddenly wearing a face mask when he visited Walter Reed?  The paramount reason for his sudden ""sense of responsible public behavior"" was because Republican states like Florida and Texas have reported record breaking number of COVID-19 cases.

It will be only a matter of days before Trump once again mocks and ridicules anyone who wears a mask in public.

The problem is so much damage and increased number of deaths have occurred because of his utter absence of effective and positive leadership.

Nothing like arriving late to the party . . . wearing the symbolic gesture of a face mask."
2020-07-12 20:37:29,How can Trump and DeVoss expect school to start in-person with the number of cases we have? Children and teenagers are not immune to this virus.
2020-07-12 17:22:39,Let's see if Betsy DeVos is willing to go into every school and teach classes all day in the Fall. Why is she so eager for thousands more to get sick and die?

2020-07-12 20:46:07,"After 29 years of living in Naples Florida I’m really glad to be leaving. Nobody is taking the pandemic seriously. This is GOP Trumplandia it won’t happen to them and their white privilege. Cash is king and Trump embodies all their greed and avarice.

2020-07-12 21:04:40,"The case load is higher than ever.

What happened?

Did all these millions of people become infected seemingly overnight?

Or perhaps huge numbers of cases have existed in our population for months - coming and going with an exponentially lower mortality rate than thought  - massive numbers of symptom-free cases not discovered simply because only those showing symptoms were allowed to be tested."
2020-07-12 21:07:08,"Yesterday, there was a heartbreaking story about a front-line physician in NYC who took her own life because of the overwhelming and daunting demands this virus has caused.  This amazing, caring, and dedicated physician was not the first healthcare provider who took her own life.  There have been others before and since her death.

My main concern, right now, today, is for all of the many, many overworked, overwhelmed and overburdened doctors, nurses, and other first responders who continue to feel the strain, drain and trauma this virus generates.

Please take care of yourselves.  Please talk and support one another during these exhausting and seemingly never ending days and nights.

You matter.  Please hang on and remember the many lives you continue to help and save every single day.

I sincerely love you folks!!!  Please take care."
2020-07-12 21:11:45,"If the people who are proudly going without a face mask or not practicing social-distancing think they're not going to get sick, their health-insurers have news for them. It will come in the form of sickening sky-rocketing health insurance premiums this fall. Residents in the states having the highest number of hospital admissions will likely see the highest premium increases in the nation. And, if their employers have seen significant decreases this year in revenues and profits, it may be virtually impossible for them not to pass those costs directly to the employees."
2020-07-12 18:35:18,"Yes, we can comment whatever we want about Florida, including losers, idiots, arrogant virus spreaders, etc. 
However, I don’t think we have the right to tell other people how they are supposed to live. That’s completely up to them. US is founded by ensuring the autonomy of each state, and every state has their own rights to choose their fates. So does each American citizens. 
It is not responsible for some people to criticize how others are living, like  “told ya to wear masks”, “you should stay at home”, etc. You are only harming American democracy and freedom when doing so."

Let’s see how she deals with children who can’t keep a mask on, who cry when they miss their parents, who can’t keep their hands off each other, and who play around in the bathroom then forget to wash their hands.

Let’s see what she thinks of the neglected building, the scary ventilation, and the crowded classrooms and hallways.

Let’s hope she shows up just as there’s an outbreak of flu (maybe it’s flu, maybe it’s covid?).

Oh wait, that’s right, she’s not a teacher. She wouldn’t have a clue how to teach, let alone address the emotional issues these kids are dealing with, how to get them to follow directions, how to make them understand the seriousness of the situation without terrifying them.

And then when the first child dies, let her be the one to look the parents in the eye and say, “but the economy was suffering...”"
2020-07-12 17:04:49,"Oh please. This was just another ""White House Photo Op"" staged solely for the cameras.

Trump says you have to wear a mask ... when you visit troops in the hospital.

Can anybody remind me of any US administration that has been this completely incompetent and out of control (and I have been around for more than 70 years)?

In my entire lifetime, you can add up the scandals, Joe McCarthy and the Commie scare in the 1950s, the John Birch Society and Barry Goldwater in the 1960s, Richard Nixon and Watergate in the 1970s, Reagan and Iran Contra in the 1980s, Bill Clinton lying about Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s, George W. Bush lying us into the Iraq War in the 2000, and Donald Trump has them all beat, COMBINED.

Add up US Grant (Credit Mobilier scandal), Warren G. Harding (Teapot Dome scandal), Hoover and he Depression, and Nixon and Trump beats that pile of scandals, combined.

WORST POTUS IN MY LIFETIME, and not even a close call.

This pandemic is going to take 200,000 lives by the time we get to Election Day.

All of those can be ascribed to this corrupt, incompetent and uncaring Trump administration.

But I am confused by the media's use of the phrase ""new cases."" If these ""new cases"" are indeed the result of more people testing positive for the virus, then yes, more testing will equal more reported cases--in which case there's no cause for hysterical headlines. Alarm, yes, because COVID still isn't under control, but that would not call for the abject panic in headlines like this one, because more testing DOES result in finding more cases. Statistically, if the story DOES refer to new positive tests, you couldn't even call them ""new cases"" if the people being tested had not been tested before and found to be negative; this is just Statistics 101. OR, are the ""new cases"" being reported the number of people being admitted to the hospital with symptoms? The difference between the two groups is statistically critical. Would it be possible for stories like this to clarify the source of their ""new cases""--testing or hospital admissions? I find stories like this to be extremely confusing."

Why would any adult do this?  I don’t know. Hello mommy/daddy issues. 

Every Southern town is full of minivans with “Mickey and Minnie” families stuck haphazardly on the back window, bonus if an anti-vax sticker is slapped on beside Pluto.

I only hope that images of him in a  mask will convince some of his supporters to don one and thus save a few Iives in the process.

Our school districts are simply not equipped or funded to run schools in a pandemic, and before anyone says that's their problem, just remember: we pay the bills for our school system, so every extra dollar that's needed will show up in your and my tax bill or taken away from your child's education!

Every store or establishment my husband and I frequent, i.e., grocery store, pharmacy, or hardware store have signs and employees are the front door, not allowing anyone to enter who is not wearing a face mask.

Nonetheless, it's conspicuously late in the game, and it makes Mike Pence look bad for no mask in a hospital photo op weeks ago.   I guess those patients were less human than the ones Trump saw at Walter Reed.

At least we could observe the best success records from other countries like Germany, Taiwan, New Zealand, Scotland (all led by women), S.Korea, and Australia. The playbook ain’t that complicated in theory:

- Shut down early and open slowly;
- Test widely, make testing easy and provide results rapidly;
- Contact trace effectively and quarantine those that become infected;
- Achieve high compliance to mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing;
- Provide adequate nationwide funding for all parts of the healthcare provider chain to cope with the crises, including widespread testing, PPE, and hospital solvency;
- Provide adequate funding for working class families to stay at home during the lockdown;
- Do not politicize the pandemic or any of the above initiatives to address the pandemic - this would only result in noncompliance.  Do not corruptly misappropriate funding meant to save lives;

Sadly, Trump’s response to these straightforward, observably effective steps is no, no, no, no, no, no, and no.  Instead he orders a fleet of proverbial buses to throw scapegoats under - his latest order appears to be for one to sacrifice Dr Fauci."

Oh, the atmosphere in pubs isn’t as freewheeling as it was at the start of the year? Cry her a river. 

And yet here we are, opening Disney World, led by a man who thinks he looks like the Lone Ranger in a mask, and besieged by the virus because half of America can’t be bothered to put on a mask and keep it on for any decent length of time. We’re being pushed to open schools without any national plan as to what that will look like, meager support for the unemployed is starting to run out, and we still don’t have enough PPE for our healthcare workers.

It is difficult to understand what these people are doing and trying to do. Perhaps ""making up"" their own version of reality, a version contrary to history, knowledge, and future in plain sight. Whatever they do, other than doing nothing, the situation will worsen and with worsening the nation's prospect for a better tommorrow will continue to fade.

It is a pity that the minority who caused this problem have affected the majority who played by the rules. I hope these young people have learned their lesson but unfortunately some never do.

The reason for this outrageous wait (with no option to leave a number and get a call back when nurse available to speak)?   It’s the influx of covid-19 related calls caused by idiotic or selfish people not following the guidelines, the lifting or lack of enforcement of some of the mandates, and poor job of local and state officials and departments at effectively communicating changes to mandates or guidance (few if any PSAs via multiple layers and types of mass media, billboards, leaflets or direct mail, robo calls, etc. Including penalties for not following.  The latter of which should include a non-retaliation clause to protect people reporting non-compliance since they are, in effect, whistleblowers.

Of course, it’s also because the HMO failed to plan ahead and have more nursing staff at the ready to handle a surge of calls, and its refusal to allow for calls back.

Our experience is likely just a taste of what will come if/when schools reopen, even partially, before a safe and reliable Covid-19 vaccine is widely available, used, and mandatory for school attendance.

I think that his failure to contain the spread of C19 is a combination of incompetence, wanting to kill off the undesirables (""there are more important things than living"" is now the Republican Mantra), and wanting to claim, that once again, he saved economy (some economy!

Something is VERY wrong with this picture. 

COVID-19 cases are rising exponentially so schools must open NOW??? My daughter teaches English as a Second Language in a high needs, inner-city school, and I totally get that school closings have created HUGE difficulties for families. But mandating that schools open, when cases are escalating, will create even worse, catastrophic problems.  

Why should my daughter or her students or her coworkers or her students' families be deliberately placed in harm's way? YES, schools need to open, but not now, and not by throwing out CDC's guidelines, and not when COVID-19 cases are breaking records in an unprecedented, upward trend.

The influence of corporations on US politics has grown increasingly since the late 1980s. 

The truth will never come out but I'd bet my 401K quite a few phone calls were made from CEOs to the White House emphasizing the need to keep business open because the economy isn't as strong as we'd like to believe, greed is good and, lastly, as strong as the stock market has been, these corporations always like to make more, as it's never enough."
2020-07-12 23:02:51,"Early on in this pandemic many wise and expert voices said you can’t solve the wealth (economic) crisis without first solving the health crisis.

We are a failed state by almost every metric, and things will only get worse as long as Republicans have any power.  Wait until the federal stimulus-stoked stock market collides with reality.

I feel for the sick and dying and their families. I feel for the energetic young adults who will be lucky to bag groceries.  I feel for the kids who are now political pawns, and their parents and teachers. I feel for all of us trapped in this dystopian nightmare like we’re in a large prison we can’t escape because no functioning countries allow us entry.  

Perhaps too much faith is being put in the November election, which the Trump criminal enterprise and its foreign backers will try to mess up by doing the unimaginable.  But the November election appears to be our last best hope for a peaceful transition and chance at righting the ship.

So it bears repeating every day: on November 3 (or earlier as your laws allow):  vote blue no matter who, up and down the ballot.  If possible, do what you can for candidates abc election integrity before then as well."

Seeing this film in our current climate was a one-two punch in the gut --

The film takes place in New Orleans - during the antebellum period - a term which has recently come under scrutiny, for obvious reasons --

At one point - the city is gripped by a plague -

""...a deadly epidemic has swept the city. They fight it with cannon and smoke and, believing that yellow fever is highly contagious, a quarantine so rigid that people who try to escape the city are shot."" -

Then - in one scene - Julie (Bette Davis) risks her life being taken in a boat by a black slave to the house where Preston (Henry Fonda) is laying in bed fighting the disease -

She enters the home and pushes her way past Dr. Livingstone (Donald Crisp) - up to Preston's bedside --

In the room - Julie and the doctor go over to Preston as he lies in bed, obviously ailing while covered in sweat --

Behind them stands the black maid-servant - who has been attending to Preston --

As Julie and the doctor stand closely over an infectious Preston - the maid stands behind -- with a cloth covering her nose and mouth (!!)

The maid never removes the protective cloth from her face during this scene - even as she's sent off by Julie to fetch some ice --

Can the NYT find similar studies in the US? 

If other studies confirm the UK results we must all adjust our response to containment and eradication, as immunity will be virtually impossible for any period over 3-6 months. With the large world wide spread it is going to be a huge task for humanity.

Fighting the pandemic with social measures as distancing, masks, hand washing etc. can easily fail, when just a minor percentage of the population deny responsibility. The Swedish failure in Scandinavia is mostly due to some 20% not obeying the rather strict but not enforceable government recommendations. 

To some extend the same is true in the US, apart from the violent protests against lock-down measures, a president and his Faux News egging these protesters, plus the late US federal action. The US lock-downs are considerably longer than similar European, and with little effect in many states. The US reopening ""strategies"" in many states are downright counterproductive from a European point of view.

In Denmark we are doing OK for now, with protective measures considerably eased. But we are balancing a tight rope, and can easily fail."

2020-07-13 00:11:01,"It is frustrating to be a CDC guideline following Floridian with a governor who puts his political agenda before our health. I don’t understand why DeSantis refuses to mandate masks! As one of the many, many people who dealt with Florida’s failure of an unemployment system while being furloughed, I don’t want to have to rely on that train wreck of a system again! I would think that the best way to keep businesses running would be to require masks to slow the spread and keep people at work. Many businesses are having to temporarily close due to workers testing positive, only to reopen and have to close again when other workers test positive! It’s crazy! Allowing businesses decide whether or not masks are required does not work. If someone walks into the store I manage and refuses to wear a mask, what do I do? Call the police? It’s not mandated by our government! 
I’d also like to mention that there has been a lot of finger pointing at the younger demographic in our state for being careless and frequenting bars and parties, but there has also been MANY vacationers that have thrown caution to the wind ever since the beaches reopened. People from all over the country have been traveling here since our phase 2 began and it’s only going to get worse now that Disney is reopening. I feel like the seven weeks I spent in quarantine have been squandered due to other people’s irresponsible and selfish behavior and I know many other people feel the same!"

2020-07-13 00:26:15,"NPR reported that Japan has asked its populace not to scream when they ride roller coasters, because doing so could spread the coronavirus. (And for anyone who is about to get up in arms because the Japanese are going on roller coasters during a global pandemic, let me remind you that this is a country that has had only 20,000 cases and 982 deaths since the pandemic began earlier this year and has a citizenry that takes its public health duties seriously. Let’s compare that with, say, Florida, which had over 15,000 new cases in a single day. Be best, Florida!)

Anyway, roller coaster riders at Tokyo theme parks are being asked to “please scream inside your heart”. Come on, Japan! What do you think we’ve all been doing since March? I don’t know about you, but so many people in the NY metropolitan area and around the country have been screaming in their hearts since late winter that I think we’re pros at it now. Given the direction Trump is currently taking us, I anticipate screaming in my heart through at least November. Who’s with me?"

We almost need to bring back the awareness that HIV taught us- live your life, but assume everyone has it. When we don’t, we get complacent. ‘It doesn’t happen here, the news just said so’. We don’t know that! This virus has only been with us 5-6 months. We hardly know what this yet. 

Life is nothing but uncertain. Four months ago was my last weekend shift before the shutdown at a job I didn’t make a lot of money at, but I loved my coworkers and customers. We’re not going to be able to open the gym. Even if we could, I can’t risk getting my parents sick. I don’t know what’ll happen after the extra unemployment is gone in a few weeks. I don’t know what, if any, job I go back to looks like. I know a lot of small and not-small businesses are gone now. Are we going to have people competing for $8.50/hr jobs? Will it be even worth it for low wage workers to work at all? Will we all pretty much be homeless, with skid row going nationwide? What’s different about life with COVID is whatever happens will happen to millions of us simultaneously. It’ll be an overnight change. Once people have lost their livelihoods, their homes and their families, there will be no reason not to join the protestors to make change happen."
2020-07-13 00:36:20,"Through his demands to state governors, along with his administration's approval, it is now apparent that Trump's wish is to see as many Americans as possible perish from Coronavirus.

I feared 4 years ago this goal of the U.S. Traitor could very likely happen. However, that fear was never in foreseeing a once in a century health Pandemic; but rather with Trump initiating a World War or two; as he had attempted to with great hope during this past's White House Christmas break. 

That was through his ordered assassination of Iran's head general in Soleimani WHILE GOLFING at his Mar-a-Lago resort; in hopes for Iran to strike back with war.

Supplementing reasons for his hopes were Trump himself last December claiming that ""presidents who start wars have a better chance at being reelected."" He then also falsely accused Obama of trying to initiate a war for like reason during his first term in office.

The bottom line is to resist and avoid everything spoken by Trump and his like crooked & killer administration; starting with their misguidance on Coronavirus; but listen only to the scientists and medical experts like a Dr. Fauci in order to survive this Pandemic."

We've seen how far denial and delusion has gotten them and the nation as tens of thousands are paying the ultimate price for what amounts to deadly willful ignorance in refusing to follow even basic public health practices like mandating the wearing of face masks.

If Trump thinks that the world renowned Dr Fauci has not been accurate, then you can bet that the good doctor has been right on the money. Trump and his mob may not like what Dr Fauci has to say, but the doctor speaks the truth. And the truth is that the White House has so badly bungled it’s response to the coronavirus that it’s a wonder that anyone remains alive in the United States. Trump, Pence, Jared, and Ivanka can have no opinion on medical issues since they are laymen with no medical or scientific knowledge whatever. In my opinion, they should all shut up and let Dr Fauci do his thing. Since they won’t, I would suggest to Dr Fauci that he leave his current post and enter the private sector from which he can be far more expansive and effective. Everything Trump touches turns rotten, and his actions relative to the pandemic are no exception. Maybe we should ask the Floridians, the Arizonans, and the Texans for their opinions. All we have to do is socially distance, use face masks in public, and wash our hands. Trump cannot bully the virus and should never even attempt to bully Dr Fauci. So the answer here is to just ignore Trump and do the right thing."
2020-07-13 01:26:53,"Free country? It's a very perverse definition of ""freedom"" if that's meant to imply that people can engage in behavior that openly endangers the well being and lives of others. By any reasonable estimation that exercise of ""freedom"" has crossed into the lane of criminality. 

That so many people should feel that they are guaranteed a ""natural right"", indeed a license, to behave in a criminal manner (whether it's driving drunk or failing to wear masks or socially distance) is a measure of the profound insanity that has gripped millions of Americans. That's not freedom. Seen charitably, it's wanton, selfish stupidity. 

On the part of a political leadership that encourages that type of behavior to suit misguided personal agendas - it should be correctly gauged as felonious. These people (the GOP) are now set to meet up shortly, by the thousands, in the state (Florida) where new Covid19 cases are now skyrocketing? One can only imagine.

By irresponsibly ignoring public health and epidemiological concerns, Trump has been brazenly trying to politicize the mask issue for his own vested interest as follows: 

Trump wants to obfuscate his accountability for his abysmal failure, to proactively contain this pandemic, in our country, by minimizing the severity of this virus from the very initial stages of this outbreak. Time and again, he apocryphally opines about the “Disappearance” of this pathogen by floating spurious ideas.  

Trump just wants to win re-election at any cost. He wants everything to go back to normal ASAP by re-opening the economy and by ignoring the inherent risk for not wearing the masks in public. Trump never acknowledged that mask-wearing is not a matter of Personal Liberty - it’s all about communal health. Furthermore, liberty is not license. 

Trump is an uber solipsistic narcissist and his Raison D’être is: “What is in for me”. Ergo from his perspective - the prospect of losing innocent human lives is just a matter of “Collateral Damage” in order to re-open the economy and also to resume normal lifestyles without the masks.

Trump must exercise self discipline and make decisions for which he will be held responsible to lead the efforts to manage the national response. He would have to confront the most influential business people and he would have to force them to follow the orders of a government that will control their firms temporarily. He cannot control the outcome and the exercise of power might cost him politically. People tend to see Trump’s authoritarian behaviors as some kind of royal pretensions but people must consider that he avoids responsibilities, habitually. 

Fauci is the voice of rational and harsh reality telling Trump that he must not think that he can avoid the hard parts of the job of the President. Trump simply refuse to accept those responsibilities. His nihilism means that he just does not believe anything matters if he does not want."
2020-07-13 01:57:40,"This should be a loud-and-clear signal to everyone--even Trump supporters--that using a pandemic wherein nearly 150,000 Americans have died, that Trump and his deplorable team are going to politicize the biggest health crisis in modern history. And the only point of Trump's politicization of the pandemic is to spread misinformation, stir up white grievance, turn citizen against citizen over the use of masks--all just for the sake that he and his deluded supporters will claim he's doing a great job. This is absurd and unacceptable. Open your eyes, Americans, and see Trump and his Administration for what they are. Trump and his cronies are not fit for their roles."
2020-07-13 01:58:42,"Trump. Has he no shame?

NO!"
2020-07-13 01:59:07,"Fauci is the only Authority left to Trump—so he tries to demolish him.

2020-07-13 01:59:57,"From the moment this virus became known in the US, Dr Fauci strove to provide the best advice based upon the data, logistical resources, and science available on hand. As these factors have evolved, Dr Fauci has unrelenting kept pace. In contrast, Mr Trump has thrown up his hands in defeat. Sure, Trump can’t change early missteps in leadership that cost lives, but he could step up now to help prevent more death. Yet he’d rather point fingers and walk away."

We're dying!
But no, rally round patriotic, can-do, encouraging, messages backed up by the strength and will of our industry and our people. 

We hear nothing. 
And when we did, it was that wooden nonsense speech from the oval office back in March followed by the clown show daily briefs where Trump proved he's insane. 

Or we get ""it'll fade away…""
Get out of here!

Biden is not the most articulate, granted. 
But, he can throw a punch. 
Let him kick well deserved sand in the face of Mr. Mustard hair at least twice a week. 

""The President is failing and flailing while Americans die""
""The President is in his own world while we die in the real world.""
""The President cares more about Roger Stone than your family.""
""When in God's name are we going to have some leadership on this crisis! Every other modern society has this mostly figured out because they are not led by pea brain!""

""Every hour of every day, my focus will be on helping you and your family avoid getting sick and maintaining your ability to financially weather this crushing moment. 
You'll have a president with a brain, a heart and courage - instead of big talking, squawking wizard of hair spray.""

Let Biden say all that. 
Even haltingly. 

Bury Trump. 
Just speak!!"

Here is an expert who has worked for six Presidents that finds himself in the most important position of his career, a position to use his expertise to inform a nation and to save lives. And what happens instead? Dr. Fauci is shut down by the most incompetent, selfish, craven administration in modern history. What they are doing to him and resultantly to the citizens of the United States is criminal."

They do, however, correct their mistakes when they get new information. They are almost all now calling for actions like masks, testing and contact tracing to reduce our risks. 

Trump on the hand, has never been right about the virus, never admitted he was wrong, never told the country to do the hard things and most often has downplayed the risks. Worse, a bunch of governors have followed his advice. 

I don’t think Dr. Fauci ever prescribed hydroxychloroquine for Covid. “dr trump” has encouraged its use causing at least one death. 

I still believe Dr. Fauci not “dr trump”. I am sorry that trump feels over shadowed in the public mind by Fauci. trump’s insecurity could cost us valuable advice and guidance."

What a brilliant strategy.

Is the intention to confuse the coronavirus, or is it to confuse the Trump supporters?

If it is to confuse the coronavirus, it won't work because the coronavirus does not understand English.

If it is to confuse the Trump supporters, it won't work because Trump supporters do not understand logic.

In my opinion, Democrats think that if something is true, they believe it.

In my opinion, Republicans think that if they believe something, it is true.

In my opinion, if on November 3 Joe Biden and the Democrats  win I think we are a democracy. 

In my opinion, if on November 3 Donald Trump and the Republicans win, I think we are a dumbocracy.

This is beyond deplorable.

Spin is one thing, but every statistic you see is not only a person but a failure of prevention.  A mask that could have been worn.  A crowd avoided.  A simple hand washing.  Any number of things that could have been done, should have been done, would have been done if we had a leader with the integrity to rely on fact.

I support Dr Fauci 100% and don't expect perfection but I trust his integrity.  As for Trump, north of 135,000 dead and he wears a mask in public for the first time.

useful to take each of the WH quotes, all of which are
surely manipulated and taken out of context, void of the nuance
that Fauci's comments are always careful to provide, and present side by side the complete statement that Fauci actually made (and when it was made, and in what context).

 Do this  for each and every one of those appearing on this manifestly  evident  hit job, manufactured by trump's errand boys, and then let the reader decide what exactly is the agenda being pushed  by those truly desperate to find yet another scapegoat,
other than the one principal culprit, aka the ogre in chief to whom their misplaced loyalties are so zealously devoted.

This, with disastrous results, however much Trump is scapegoating responsibility of his own huge failure to take charge, blaming China, democrats, and any and all that moves...except his own incompetence and corruption.

The monstrosity of this administration’s crimes defies comprehension. 

Decades ago The New York Times Magazine featured a photograph on the cover of the seven CEOs of the largest tobacco companies all with their right hands in the air being sworn to testify before a congressional investigating committee. The caption read: “How Do These Men Sleep At Night?”  One wonders the same thing about this administration’s wielders of power and their enablers and sycophants. Their mendacity knows no limits."

After all, won't it just magically disappear once the weather turns warm?"

Would our sheer numbers cause our Congresspeople to sit up and take notice?  

We'd need to emphasize in our calls for impeachment the undeniable danger of these days. We'd need to stress our fears that too many have already died under Trump's incompetent leadership. We'd need to sound the alarm that untold numbers will die in the coming months if Trump stays in power. And we'd also need to make sure each one (especially the ones with an ""R"" by their names) comprehends that they will be considered responsible for those future deaths.

We’re dealing with a small second wave at the moment - Melbourne’s in re-lockdown after a spike of 150 cases in a day. In the end it comes down to politicians acting on the advice of the eminently qualified medical professionals.

The idea of invoking 'personal freedom' when personal responsibility is lacking in this situation, is wrong. Second, how significant are these categories, opened at partial capacity, on the economy when the outcome was predicted by those who took Dr Fauci's and other's advice. The impact has made things for all of us and for the economy, far worse. Will the administration extend the PPP plan through to next summer for the workers in those categories while subsidizing corporations which have significant assets or access to money?"

If Dr. Fauci is removed from his position, that ""67 percent of Americans who trust him when it come to the virus"" will soon erupt to an even higher percentage of Americans who will be outraged and against Trump.

However, for the White House to actively spend energy tearing down Dr. Fauci for those faulty recommendations is ironic.  The President said the virus would go away in April.  The President said that his opponents were using the virus as a new hoax.  It seems that the President was far more wrong than Dr. Fauci.  Now the man who explained that he did not want to give the press the satisfaction of seeing him in a mask is wearing one.  

If it is justifiable for the White House to attack Dr. Fauci, they should consider reserving their greatest critiques for the President himself.  If they are making lists of errors, perhaps they should point folks to the website which catalogues all of the falsehoods the President has uttered and tweeted in a database.  Imagine ... there are so many of them, they have to be managed in a database.  If any one of us had spoken even a small fraction of such falsehoods, we could expect to be dismissed from our jobs and shunned by our communities in far less time.

A little self critique and reflection would serve this President well."

That being said, even if Fauci were at fault, any president of even middling  competence would promptly assemble a national panel of medical experts to guide us through this. Trump, however, is content to let Kushner and Meadows put to get an opposition research file to snipe at Fauci. Trump’s strategy is criminally derelict and those in the White House who facilitate his failed policy are equally guilty. There must be a way to end Trump’s dereliction and formulate a more effective national plan. His cabinet officers who don’t wish to be further complicit in Trump’s failure must step forward without him."

Trump was impeached, the Republican Party made its choice, and we are now swimming in the ashes of what used to be a fairly functional, if flawed, country.  It was a physically painful experience for most of us, but we needed to experience this betrayal by Republicans to fully understand the level of evil we’re dealing with.  There’s no sense in repeating the process.

All we can do now is send as many of these treasonous excuses for chair warmers home after November as possible.  Providing enough of us can actuality get past these guys to vote.

I’d make the same observation about Dr. Birx, but unlike Fauci, she seems to have drunk the Kool-Aid. How else would one describe not speaking up forcefully and unambiguously in opposition when in the same room with a deranged lunatic who suggests that patients be injected with bleach? Signaling mild displeasure by casting one’s eyes downward doesn’t come close to cutting it.

Why don’t leaders (governors, mayors, etc) close instead of saying “people should..” Because then that state has to pay for lost compensation, like unemployment.

Railing about Trump is now pointless. It does on and on and on and nothing at all will change until he's voted out. Nothing.

Anyone interested in change should expend that energy on calling everyone in their sphere, or posting on social media, the need to vote this fall for change, and remind people of critical dates, such as deadlines for registration and in some states for applying for mail-in-ballots. I've done this already in Rhode Island.

With a health crisis and the onset of seasonal flu in fall I have no intention of standing in polling lines that will be very lengthy and crowded. So, if you want to mail in your vote, figure out soon what your state requires. Some states will only use mail-in.

Stop bemoaning what cannot be changed, throw your shoulders back, flex your muscles and get to work on what can change. We all feel bad, many of us feel outraged and scared. These are corrosive feelings. Be happy you're alive, and use that life to take back and rebuild an America that can stand proud. Act!

Stop catastrophizing and start accelerating. I have turned into someone I don't recognize and I want my old feisty, gritty, optimistic, kick-butt self back. That's on me to reactivate."
2020-07-13 17:46:43,"There are things that Fauci said that were wrong.  Most of them were said to appease Trump and probably made at his insistence.  For example, early on Fauci said the reason we were “doing way better than Italy” was that we shut down travel from China and Italy didn’t.  This was designed to give Trump a bump, and it was patently, ludicrously, false!  We were not doing better, we did not shut down anything, Chinese travelers were entering by the thousands from everywhere else, and Italy did shut down direct Chinese travel slightly after we did.  If there is a problem with Fauci it is that he has been used as  a tool of a deviant sick egomaniac.  He tries to do right and appease a moron at the same time.  Fauci should resign to salvage whats left of his dignity and profession reputation."

Consider … How many states have sufficient testing to combat outbreaks? (Ans. Around half a dozen. Would one consider any other state safe?) How many states have the necessary health care staffing? (If there are a 1,000 open ICU beds and there is one ICU doctor there really aren’t 1,000 ICU beds.) How many states have supportive governments? (Amazingly, this is the major issue. The gaslighting Trump-first federal government is an obstacle, so no help there.) Older people, like parents and grandparents, are considered most susceptible and that includes most teachers too, so will governments supply them the necessary protective information/gear/funding? (This is the other major issue.)

Open by August safely? Maybe a couple states can safe do it at this point. Run away from Florida, Arizona, Texas, etc."
2020-07-11 16:43:34,"Recommend this article be sent to School Boards across the nation. Curiously no mention is made of questioning gym/sports activities where close contact is common. Nor cancelling auditoriums, bus trips. Nor managing social distancing for students waiting to enter school or just million about inside. It may well be the greatest risks of opening schools are infecting teachers and the families of the students themselves. No matter what strategies are chosen there will be both infections and eventual Covid 19 fatalities from opening schools. As with virtually every other facet of our social world."
2020-07-11 16:51:02,"This is one of the better articles to outline SOME of the issues with returning to school. It’s not just virus control that has to be considered. 
1. In every instance, countries that returned to school had infections under control.
2. Schools returned in phases with reduced schedules (the hybrid model in the US)
3. Schools were monitored with testing and either closed or some portion quarantined when an infection was discovered. 
4. All of the countries mentioned have implemented universal access to health care that would likely lead to higher health outcomes than in the US. 

To open in the US:
1. Teachers are part of the decision making process
2. Testing is readily available, frequently used, and has quick results 
3. The business community steps up to donate whatever is needed to get schools open: space, devices, services, expertise, supplies, PPE, and personnel to help manage students when teachers only have a portion of their students at a time. 
4. Health care and mental health professionals donate their time and expertise to make sure kids and essential school workers are healthy. 
5. Government rules established to help teachers care for their families, provide in times of illness, and provide answers to basics like how outbreaks are handled, restroom breaks, substitute teachers, time for teachers to use the restroom and eat, and teacher responsibilities for school discipline. 

School starts in 3 weeks. Go!"
2020-07-11 16:51:12,"Its clear young kids are very low risk both directly and as vectors, and the need for live instruction at that age is the most pressing.  
No one can promise anyone zero exposure in a post Covid world.  If we open schools someone will get Covid.  Also, if we don’t open schools.  Someone will get Covid. The kids will still have to go somewhere!  
If school is safe 3 days a week, its safe 5 days a week.  It would actually be safer since kids wouldn’t be spending every other off day at some other random day care.  
If schools can’t keep adults and kids reasonably safe, why do we think day care centers and nannies can?"

But nevertheless, you think they WILL provide this magic money. Given the hard evidence--nationally replete, I think to expect such an outcome borders on fantasy. 

I did notice that the most damaging evidence against openings is pushed to the end--opening is countries with high numbers is a bad idea--of the article and that no mention is given to studies that show that children (up to the lower 20s!) are incapable of keeping the protocols for months at a time.My daughter age 19, has told me this is definitely her experience at her dorm ."

""The U.S. growth model is built in such a way that it simply cannot shut down without inflicting catastrophic damage on itself. Because the model is designed to adjust through reduced wages and employment rather than increased welfare outlays, political leaders can contemplate temporary unemployment benefits for a banking-induced shock, but not semipermanent cash transfers—which is what the British are doing—and a near-total collapse in asset values. The British solution is too politically toxic to be anything other than a short-term expedient in the American context—the epidemiologically correct response was to put the economy in hibernation for several months, (but) U.S. leaders started looking for other solutions.

 Putting the economy in a freezer for six months or longer would destroy what’s left of its social fabric along with its growth model. But restarting it could turn the pandemic into a plague that could cause as much damage as the freezer.



ABANDONING THE LOCKDOWN

Which of these unappealing paths is the United States most likely to take? Again, examining its underlying growth model is revealing. It suggests that the United States will temporarily bail out companies, partially support consumption, and abandon the lockdown as soon as it can.""

And we won’t be the first taking great risks in the name of education."
2020-07-11 17:07:32,"There are parts of the US that should be in complete lock down again, in order to bring covid infections down to a manageable level. Arizona, Florida, Texas, S Carolina, Mississippi, &c. should not even consider for one MINUTE opening schools with infection rates like they've got.

The Northeast is a whole different ball game. Our infection rates are relatively low and reopening schools with precautions is reasonable. What we need to do is figure out what has worked well elsewhere and implement it. Have plans in place for how to react if a student or staff member was found to be infected.

There will be temporary setbacks such as isolated school closures. It is important to tell teachers, staff, parents and students what is being done, why it is being done, what problems are anticipated and how they might be countered. In advance.

There is still more to be done here. Improving the contact-tracing program should be a top priority, especially as schools plan to reopen. Forget about 6 ft, masks should be mandatory in indoor public places all the time, including schools. 

Here in the Northeast, we have the opportunity to continue our recovery and do it correctly. Let's not get distracted from that - except to VOTE in November."
2020-07-11 17:14:04,Does anyone worry about the social and emotional impact of sending kids to school with social distancing and mask-wearing? It's stressful for kids to be given this kind of life or death responsiblity. That stress may be even greater than the stress of a lockdown.

2020-07-11 17:20:41,A complex problem with no easy solution.  Certainly K through 3 require full time in person teaching.  The loss would be irremediable for them and they might never catch up.   Older children could have progressively more distance learning.   Space not used by older students could be allocated to younger ones in small groups.  Of course gyms and auditoriums could also be used.  We need lots of solutions.
2020-07-11 17:21:57,"I want to mention an issue I haven't seen addressed anywhere. I'm not a psychologist, but I wonder what effect there might be on kids--especially young kids who are entering school for the first time--of spending their day at school masked, with their desks widely separated from other kids, with their teacher (whose desk is spaced far from the kids' desks and may even be behind a plexiglass screen) telling them all day long not to get close to each other. This is clearly not a normal setting for normal social development. Maybe the main lesson some kids will learn at school is that people outside their own family or immediate circle of friends are scary and dangerous."
2020-07-11 17:25:11,"With all the data around the world this article indicates, hopefully more than just a few institutions are crunching this data with “super” computers and using the analytics to find similar conclusions so schools can plan to adapt to the needs of their local communities in the basis of the level of the outbreak within their communities. 

Some schools may have to alter their schedules and be open 50 weeks out of the year to accommodate limiting class sizes and /or setting altering weeks when certain kids from different locals within the community physically attend. 

There should also be an incentive for parents, such as tax breaks who can afford one parent staying home to either home school them or just stay home while their children are taught online provided by either their local school district, or a private online school.

Teachers will need to be flexible and especially where their unions have a lot of political power.

There are viable alternatives but all parties involved; parents, politicians, administrators and teachers must work together and provide both teachers and parents options to opt out."
2020-07-11 17:26:34,"Though our school district has done a good job of balancing the needs of kids with the needs of teachers, we have decided on homeschooling for a year. The ever changing schedule (from medium to high restriction — half day and half online) and the anxieties and needs of our two kids, when added to the high risk parent we have in the house, have made it hard to see a path to school that would not be fraught. However my family  is lucky that we have the ability and resources to school (with district help) at home. Many don’t. 
I’m holding all of us parents in the light, that we support each other’s differing abilities and needs. There are no easy choices."
2020-07-11 17:28:33,"Could you imagine if nurses and doctors were refusing to go back to work because they were afraid of their own exposure? I get it, I work in healthcare, it can feel scary, but sometimes we have to put the good of others before our own needs (and yes, personal safety)￼.  

If the teachers won’t go back to work, and the kids aren’t going back to in-person school, just close the schools altogether and give the school budget to the parents so they can hire people to look after their children."
2020-07-11 17:30:26,"My wife and I are both teachers, and both terrified about putting our safety in the hands of the current US leadership.

Both in class and distance learning. Effective, uncomfortable, but safe - janitors cleaning, only 1 student per restrooms, dots on floor for distancing, pool noodles for visuals. Outside as much as possible. No not comfy, but a decent plan."
2020-07-11 17:40:51,"Picking a date and manner of reopening schools is an academic exercise when the pandemic remains in the exponential boost phase in many locales. We blew through 20k, 40k, and 60k new cases per day and appear well on our way to 100k or even 200k before things stabilize. 

Each person’s acquisition of the virus can last many weeks, meaning were accumulating more and more active and contagious victims. Hospitals are again being overwhelmed in the hardest hit cities. Meanwhile, conservative Texans are blasting governor Abbott for requiring masks and limiting crowd sizes. And Trump has sidelined Dr. Fauci for months, preferring to pretend the virus has become inconsequential. 

Anyway, there’s already enough momentum built into the epidemic to keep cases rising for several more weeks, probably at the world’s highest rate. We can take individual local approaches to school reopening, but none are safe if we can’t stifle the explosion of new cases. They‘ll likely spread and endanger new communities. 

I’d advocate planning for school reopening, make sure we have adequate testing and PPE resources, but wait an extra month anywhere cases are rising exponentially or have settled at an unacceptable rate. Flattening super high curves won’t cut it. We need to get the upper hand and maintain those measures until we have vaccines or much better therapeutics. Children and their teachers are not little soldiers worthy of sacrificing to get an unfit president re-elected."
2020-07-11 17:42:58,"Keep kids 6th-12th learning remotely. They contract, spread, and can learn remotely.

What is so hard to understand about this?"
2020-07-11 17:44:15,"In June the Harvard School of Public Health published well-researched guidelines on mitigating coronavirus transmission in schools and colleges. It covers issues like ventilation, spacing, social distancing, you name it. Everybody in charge of a school or school building should read and act on it.

When Harvard administrators read it, they gulped and decided to shut down in-person classes for the whole school year.

Harvard can afford to do that. What are the rest of us gonna do? Trump and his fellow Republicans don't care; they're not helping schools improve ventilation or anything else. They are derelict in their duty."

That the WHO is just now coming this conclusion after more than 6 months is not that comforting. 

What have they been doing that it took them this long to make this determination?  

Hopefully few if any school administrators were relying  the WHO heavily to plan for re-opening schools, since  this gives planners less time to make decisions and implement changes, such as upgrading or adding HVAC equipment."
2020-07-11 17:50:39,"This article is thorough, informative, and presents a nuanced look at this issue. 

Yet, it still ends with this:
“There is really damage to kids if they don’t go to school,” Dr. Edwards said. “I think we have got to think of the kids and getting them back to school safely.”

YES, BUT...we have to think of the ADULTS, TOO. What if there is no way to go back safely? We should be planning for rich, quality virtual learning environments that can support student learning and emotional health at the same time that they are protecting students AND STAFF from the virus.

We are wasting precious time talking about optimal air circulation that schools cannot provide and PPE that not all students and families will agree to wear.  Until the numbers are way down and testing is way up, we are gambling."
2020-07-11 17:52:28,"If Dr. Edwards is so concerned about the implications for child development or the impact on racial and economic inequalities, has she considered the same for those children who are losing their parents forever to Covid-19?  Or whose parents may survive but suffer permanent debilitating effects?

It would seem that having a parent die from Covid-19; or suffer permanent disability would have a much greater impact on child development and inequality versus waiting an extra 3 or 4 months or even an extra year, if necessary, for a vaccine and/or proven medical treatments.  

Given both political parties and presidents of both parties, yes, including Obama-Biden, have had absolutely zero problem throwing trillions upon trillions of dollars away in the ""Forever Wars"" and on insane corporate welfare for companies like Lockheed and the budget-busting F35 fighter jet, one could think Congress could print some more money to extend the boosted unemployment benefits through March of 2021 and let the scientists and pharmaceutical companies continue to make their progress."
2020-07-11 18:01:49,"I am a public school teacher in Austria, and our schools have been open for several weeks.  We started with the senior class (they had exam preparations and then took the state exams), followed by K-8, and two weeks after that grades 9-11.  Numbers were closely monitored and stayed low throughout.  Masks were required for the first few weeks, and students came to school in half groups, group 'A' Monday-Wednesday, 'B' Thursday - Friday, and the following week they would switch.  Desks were spaced out and students were monitored for social distancing.  Disinfectant was easily available and students were responsible for disinfecting their desks, chairs, etc under teacher supervision.  PE classes were cancelled and music teachers were instructed to 'not sing' for the first few weeks.  Teachers aged 60 and up were not required to teach in person, and anyone with pre-existing conditions were also excused.

I think it worked out well because it was spring - summer, and windows were constantly open.  I think an airless room would be very disconcerting, but fortunately this is not an issue in my school building.

I think it was really good for the students to be back (and for me personally).  But our numbers at the time were excellent (they are rising slightly now).  Here it seems they will close schools regionally based on case numbers - one region closed their schools early because of a outbreak in the area."
2020-07-11 18:05:58,"Those ""studies"" sound like anecdotes to me. For every incident where transmission didn't happen, I can raise you one where it did. Just this week, I read about an Arizona summer school where three teachers sharing a school room got sick.

 One of the teachers died. That life may feel statistically meaningless to the selfish cadre of people who want to sacrifice teachers but I assure you she meant a great deal to the people who loved her. 

Children today are likely to live another 100 years. At a minimum. Would adding an additional year of education at the tail end of their school career really be so bad? Isn't that better than a viral legacy that might leave them with long term health problems?   

The truth is we don't know what kind of virus this is... it's characterized as a respiratory virus, but it looks more likely to be vascular. There is evidence of different strains and mutations. That would mean that we are literally gambling with the teaching and administrative and custodial staffs lives, yes, but also with an entire generation of American school children who might have vascular and inflammatory issues for the rest of their lives. Russian Roulette indeed.

A hybrid model is the best means to encourage as many kids and teachers as are able to to stay and work from home. Home may not be for everybody  for a myriad of issues including economic and situational but let's not force those who can shelter out to prove a point.

Don't gamble with lives."
2020-07-11 18:08:47,"My husband (now retired) was a general contractor with much of his work in large hospitals. One of the main concerns with working in that environment is infection control. During construction, special negative air ventilation systems with hepa  filters were used. Perhaps the school systems and other large facilities could install these special systems that get rid of or greatly reduce the amount of virus particles in the air. Something to consider."
2020-07-11 18:10:49,"@Cara This line of thinking is maddening. I want my kids back in school desperately, but not at the risk of anyone’s health. Yes, people will get Covid in school and out, you are correct about that. But to open schools before we have driven down the infection rate is throwing gas on the fire. Why is this so hard for some of us to see?
As a country, we messed up. Now we need a do-over. We have to lock down and get the numbers low. We have to then be able to test effectively enough to knock down cases where they flare up.  That’s how other countries are doing it. 
Sometimes simplicity is very hard."
2020-07-11 18:14:37,"So very easy for commenters to sit in their homes and telework, while saying that we just have to open schools.  Right now all but two states are failing to show decline in virus cases, and the majority of states have out-of-control rise in virus cases, hospitalization.  We are proposing sending children and adults into crowded classrooms and onto crowed school buses.  The adults working in school systems will bring the virus to school, and it will infect other adults.  Then they will go out into the community and spread the infections.  The school classrooms do not have enough space to socially distance children, sufficient ventilation of buildings, nor enough personnel to monitor children for safe hygiene practices.  And remember, these are children, whose impulse control and behavioral regulation are only gradually developing; they are not capable of consistently monitoring their own behavior. Envision masks dropped, sneezing and coughing, failure to wash hands after using the restroom, etc.. Re-opening schools cannot be considered until virus cases have dropped well below current the explosive levels.  Levels that have killed, at the very least, 133,000.  Levels that are overwhelming hospitals and that leave some recovering victims with lingering health problems and disabilities."
2020-07-11 18:16:17,"This is moot if states can't bring community transmission down to LOW levels and test quickly.  Opening schools with current high levels of transmission isn't feasible.  When/if virus transmission is low, then schools can reopen in a phased way, as NYC plans to do.  The idea that schools can immediately reopen completely to all students, as Trump and Devos are blaring, is unrealistic and dangerous.  Since 25% of public school teachers are over 50, teacher concerns must be addressed.  Providing adequate PPE in schools, installing hand washing in every class room, and opening windows and filtering air in schools, along with regular testing of students and staff could increase safety for the adults at schools.  But these improvements will cost money that most local school districts don't have.  However, given that $500B of federal stimulus funds went to large corporations, the feds should not be constrained from printing more money to support schools.  One way to use federal funds to protect older teachers would be to install large LED screens in classrooms that are hard-wired for real time video chatting between students in a spaced classroom and a teacher sitting in a different room at school, able to interact with their students.  Unemployed recent college grads could be paid to serve as teachers' aids, circulating in the classroom to help students with assignments and interacting with the teacher by video.  Teachers and aids could meet each morning to plan the day."
2020-07-11 18:22:13,"Many of the countries cited that have successfully reopened schools have a population accustomed to making personal decisions based on what is best for all. American’s zeal for individualism is a barrier to containing the virus in our communities. 
Our school systems are already underfunded. Many of our school buildings are inadequate and a large number of people care more about their so called individual freedoms than they do about others. 
To compare success in countries like Norway returning to schools to the possibility of Americans returning to school, ignores the myriad differences in both societal values and structural systems."
2020-07-11 18:27:24,"In Denmark, elementary kids went back first. My child's school: parents drop off at staggered times, don't go in. The class was divided in 2, different rooms, only saw each other outside. Within the room, there were defined playgroups. Hand hygiene is emphasized here (not masks), with new sink stations on the playground, and planned hand washing breaks throughout the day. Walks in small groups to neighborhood spots to be outdoors were frequent in the afternoon. In the beginning the school days were not as long as normal. By the end of the school year the class was reunited, full school day reinstated, and hand hygiene habits the new normal.

2020-07-11 19:01:47,"NOW is the time for the federal government to increase funding for schools significantly.  If Trump wants schools to open then he should push for more money.  $400B for schools for in-person learning would allow needed maintenance (especially for air systems), testing, masks, training, and hiring.  This money would help the economy directly and also indirectly in allowing parents to work without having to effectively home-school and babysit."
2020-07-11 19:05:03,"The article missed an opportunity to mention that Swede, which kept schools up through junior high open at all times has not had any outbreaks in schools among children. The few large clusters we’ve seen was solely within the adults working at schools where they apparently did not practice social distancing between adults. Swedish and Finnish health agencies also studied the outcome and concluded that keeping the schools open in Sweden did not add to the infection rate among the citizens. Teachers where also not infected at a higher rate compared to other professions that could not work from home."
2020-07-11 19:05:03,Can’t even begin to fathom how teachers will be able to deal with enforcing students to wear masks in those parts of the country where parents refuse to.  Seems like a lot of too little too late compromising will have to take place if schools are to reopen.  And then another health crisis most likely will unfold  Hard to even prepare for a plan B when plan A Isn’t even close to being formulated.  Any decision seems futile.
2020-07-11 19:05:55,"There is still a great deal that we don't know about Covid-19. For example, the data tells us that infection rates for the young are infinitesimally small compared to overall infection rates.

Presently we don't know why. I know in my neighborhood when schools closed kids of all ages continued to play outside among themselves. Among teens lack of social distance was almost the norm.

This doesn't mean that there is no risk. But it suggests that the risk is probably greater between adults school personnel than it is among students.

This argues for reopening schools. Most teachers agree that we can basically write off the spring semester. We can't afford to have a similar fall semester of hit and miss zoom classes.

But the lack of infections among the young raises other issues. Could it be that generally young people have a stronger immune system than adults?

Elderly persons (70 and over) in many communities account for over half the Covid fatalities.

If this hypothesis of immune function has some weight, shouldn't we employ methods to strengthen those defenses as part of any overall plan on school attendance?

And, shouldn't the parents of our kids do the same? There are simple, inexpensive ways of strengthening natural immunity, all verified by peer review literature.

In addition to wash your hands maybe we should be adding ""and take your Vitamin C and D3."""
2020-07-11 19:06:03,"Street fogging or store isle fogging is often observed in those Asian countries that successfully managed through this virus.   Basically they are disinfecting the dust on the streets.    Why?   Wouldn't it be logical to think that the virus can ride on the dust and float in the air waiting to be lodged deep in our lungs?    Also, wouldn't it be correct to think that we will never be able to avoid the virus 100%, and that it is all about managing to reduce the viral intake and time duration?     S. Korea recently started opening their K12 schools, and they are putting good size HEPA air purifiers in the classrooms, nation wide.   And of course the masks are must.    We, in the US,, are in more difficult situation, considering that fact that we tend to have more carpeted areas (carpeted floors are not common in Asia), and that our buildings do not pull in enough air from outside to save heating and cooling energy.    We need to be smart now.   Too many souls are lost."
2020-07-11 19:10:38,"It's all about the background infection rate and the use of wide-spread testing.

If the background infection rate is high, then moving desks around, improving air condition, pods, etc. is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

If the background infection rate is low, then many of these things might contribute to increased success (decreased transmission) but only wide-spread testing, with fast result read-outs, will really matter.  If infections can be caught quickly, schools will be able to remain open.

Every time wide-spread testing is mentioned, the cost of that testing is raised as some kind of excuse for why it isn't being done.  That's nonsense.  The cost to the economy of not being able to open schools dwarfs the cost of testing.  If other countries can test wide swaths of their populations frequently, then we can too."
2020-07-11 19:12:27,"Schools are not islands onto themselves. We can't wall them off from the surrounding community. The virus doesn't care about our good intentions or that in classroom instruction is best for children. It will enter schools and classrooms. Students and teachers will become infected, some will suffer permanent injuries, and some will die.

What is not being noted in articles on the school reopening debate is that in parts of the US the virus is not only spreading like wildfire amount young adults, it is also spreading rapidly among children. This growth is occurring despite schools being closed, many children staying home, and children not being tested in proportion to their percentage of the US population. 
 
I am further concerned that the impact of Codvid-19 on children may prove to be significantly worse than is understood today. Teenagers may be just as vulnerable to the disease as young adults. Even younger children may at risk. The study published in Lancet this week on the dangerous inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19 in children is cause for concern. The researchers estimate that 1.5% of all children inflected with the coronavirus will develop the syndrome & require hospitalization. 

If that occurs in the US, no one will be able to say only ""a small number of children"" are impacted by Covid-19. Tens of thousands of children will be left with life-long damage and some will die."
2020-07-11 19:14:43,"""...send children back..."" crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation...""

Yet another article that makes no mention of the school bus environment.  It is as if no one has taken into account the actual ""sending"" part of the re-opening issue. I grew up in a rural environment and rode a crowded school bus 40 minutes each way, twice a day, five days a week. My fellow passengers were of all ages from six to 18. 

While some might say it would be easy to just keep the windows down to ensure fresh air ventilation, I wonder how many parents would send their children on a bus with windows down when the outdoor temperature is below zero. And simply re-opening schools isn't going to work when a significant number of students are bused in and out every day. 

To date, I've seen neither a reporter nor or an epidemiologist address this issue."

2020-07-11 19:28:59,"A majority of the Home Schooling education in the USA have been the conservative, put it differently, the republican families. Now, the most eager and enthusiastic people about school reopening are the conservative as well. Is there a theory?"
2020-07-11 19:32:15,"Basically there is only one reason Trump and his administration want schools open. That frees up parents to return to work. Trump is willing to put families and teachers health (and even lives) at risk so he can point to a recovering economy in search of his re-election. It is all about Trump, not about the kids. 

Actual responsible reopening is going to require reducing class sizes. Drastic changes will be required."

The Ophthalmology Assoc issued an urgent warning to the WHO and CDC in June re aerosol exposure and infection risks through unprotected EYES!   This has not been investigated thoroughly nor highlighted enough to the general public.    

There are no plans for eye protection that I have read about for the teachers and children.  

Having negative airflow filtration rooms is not feasible.
The amount of aerosol ""wafting from the HVAC"" systems in any area will impact risk exposures for teachers and students no matter how far apart they are.    

""Constant absences"" due to the eventual random, positive cases, then the contact tracing and quarantining are mind-boggling to think about."
2020-07-11 19:43:45,"If schools here reopen in September, I will have to forego being with my three grandchildren. In fact I will have to go back to self-isolation. I have already missed three months of their lives. I don’t want to miss more but I will rather than play the Russian roulette of contact in the age of coronavirus.

If schools do reopen, it will take about three weeks before there’s a spike in infection rates and they have to close them down again.

We have to realize that forms of quarantine and isolation will be with us all until there is a vaccine. We are in a new age."

2020-07-11 19:48:53,"My question is around how much liability a school assumes when a child gets sick and transmits the disease to parent or someone else.  We are taking what is, by definition, a non-socially distanced environment and trying turning it into something that is attempts to be socially distanced.  All efforts are going to come up short in some respects and someone is going to get sick.  What happens when a student get a family member sick and then they can't work.  Given how litigious this society is, I can envision law suits where parents attempt to sue schools and school boards - especially if those schools are private or religious schools.  I can easily imagine scenarios where religious and private schools are put out of business and teachers, administrators and board members are sued because of law suits filed by parents.  If it were me, I wouldn't take on that kind of liability.  If you want to open the schools there should be some protective measures to hold school administrators and boards harmless who follow the appropriate guidelines."

2020-07-11 20:04:24,"School will not be business as usual until there is a vaccine.  Socialization will not be able to occur normally whether in school or not.  If corporations aren't holding meetings in conference rooms with 12 people, why is it deemed safe for students and staff to go back to school and be in a room with at least 12 others? 

Safety is the most important point right now and school should not take place in the building since lives will be endangered."
2020-07-11 20:04:55,"Are there any statistics available for Sweden? 
Sweden had a much wider community spread than it's Scandinavian neighbors which makes it a better country to compare with the situation here in the US. After being hit hard, their positive test results and hospitalizations are now steadily declining making it comparable to the development in, for example, New York state.
They did not close elementary schools or daycare at all, while high schools and universities had distance learning only. Parents were asked to keep their children home if they were the slightest sick.There was no distancing or use of masks. School days include lots of outside play and most schools are spacious and airy, but otherwise it compares well with schools in the US. 
As per the Folkhälsomyndigheten (Swedish CDC) keeping the children in school did not increase the spread. Teachers did get sick, and at least one teacher died, but it is believed they were infected by other adults or not at school. 
I hope the NY Times will look into it. I would be interested to learn more on how keeping the schools open the whole time affected the students and staff, and society at large. And if it turns out that it worked out okay, wouldn't that be a bit of sorely needed good news?"
2020-07-11 20:07:24,"In the same way that med and nursing school students are being given the opportunity to intern at hospitals and clinics during the pandemic, why not allow all education school students around the country to intern in classrooms this fall. We could place them in classrooms under the online supervision of older, more at risk teachers who are afraid to go back into their rooms. And then let’s forgive their student loans as a thank you."
2020-07-11 20:12:55,"It breaks my heart that all our children and teachers are in this position.  Before schools can re-open, we must have proper testing and approved therapeutics.  Right now, hype is running the storyline behind therapeutics and smaller biotech companies are getting buried under it.  Case in point - Cytodyn’s drug Leronlimab turned around several critical cases - the mechanism is that to be that it is reducing the hyper-immune inflammatory response that leads to mortality in so many of these cases.  

Please NYT, do the leg work that others aren’t doing.  Go beyond fluff summary pieces about all the players involved in this research and really dig into the science.  In a world that can no longer recognize truth, dignity and compassion, you can contribute here."

Before the lockdown, the NYC department of ed covered up infections in schools and DeBlasio insisted that we should stick to the status quo.  Teachers in my school don’t have any faith in the chancellor or the mayor to keep the health of students and staff in mind beyond political expediency.  They will drape themselves in the Excellence and Equity banner that will insulate them from health risks and play the “I care more about kids than you so I’m right” card."

Here in the US we tend to not learn from our own mistakes let alone other people's science/countries successes.
Somehow we still have the illusion that the US is still a leader in every aspect. The truth is not only have we fallen behind many other countries we do nothing to help business, education, Heath, ... while our inept leaders take decades trying to reinvent the wheel rather than look to other countries for what has or has not worked for the best interest of their country and all of its citizens."

Never entered the store.  There all of one minute.
Is this what he has in mind for schools?"
2020-07-11 20:21:05,"The risk is still too great.  The focus should be on distance learning and more parental involvement.  Yes, parents.  Remember them?  Schools are not free babysitting service.  We pay billions of dollars to transport and feed children in school.  Why not use those resources to assist parents in educating their own children.  We may soon be seeing a new model for educating children."
2020-07-11 20:27:34,"As was written earlier this week in a Star-Ledger article, ""In New Jersey, nearly 500 school buildings are more than 50 years old and are typically four times more densely populated than office buildings. Those conditions strained aging ventilation systems long before they were ever expected to keep people safe in a pandemic...""

This week, it was revealed three teachers in Arizona, who worked in the same classroom, practiced social distancing, and proper sanitizing - contracted the virus. They taught first grade. One has died.  

Eleven thousand children in Florida currently have tested positive for the virus. 

Most people agree that students currently learn better in schools, but unfortunately, we're in the middle of a pandemic. Instead of focusing on sending students back to school, you need to start asking, ""How can we enhance digital learning, so children get the social and academic development they need?"" 

Articles such as this say teachers, staff, and yes - even parents who come to the school to pick up and drop off their students - should be sacrificed. The NYT is saying my mom and her colleagues are disposal, and they are not. You're also missing that children are now getting the virus, as mentioned above, and may have lingering effects long into adulthood, as in an article you wrote today. 

Care for others. Stop printing articles that support the deaths of more Americans, and start exploring ways schools can enhance their offers in a digital manner."
2020-07-11 20:28:14,"As a student from upstate New York, opening up schools is simply not the answer. Even though there’s virtually 0 cases in my county we never know where students have been over the summer. We cannot trust everyone to wear a mask or even have a mask. Sitting in school for eight hours with kids. To protect the heath of our students, elders, and staff we shouldn’t open up.￼"
2020-07-11 20:30:30,"The school authorities know that the virus is still untamed. Using data from other countries is risky because we are the country with more infected persons. There is an old saying ""Better safe than sorry"". We know that we are living a strange and difficult time. And we are risking many lives. Millions of American young people had to postpone their studies during World War 2. But most of them thrived and this country had a very successful economic and intellectual life from 1945 to the 1960's. Moon landing anyone else?"
2020-07-11 20:30:50,"We can divide the  states in this country in 3 categories (1) States in which the rate of infection continues growing, ( 2)  States which have controlled the rate of infection with great effort and loss of life and (3) Those in which the rate of infection was never threatening. It seems that opening schools in category (1) is clearly imprudent. In  category (2) schools could be open but with very strict back up plans to avoid a new catastrophe  as soon as something goes wrong. But teachers need to heard on this decision.
In (3) schools could be open but back up plans need also to be in place.  The school week or the  duration of the school day could be shorter.
All these comparisons with European countries are not applicable because those countries have controlled the virus so far. More importantly new outbreaks are taking place every day  followed by isolation of the outbreak areas(Israel, Germany, Spain). Perhaps if we wait after the Summer is over, some countries in Europe find themselves again in the mess they were on March and April."
2020-07-11 20:32:42,"There are so many experts weighing in on this issue with different ideas and data. I've responded to this with comments in other articles. Way too risky right now. Politicians want to control something (Covid) that can't be controlled presently. I laugh at the experts who are concerned about students' social development. Really? Nowadays they socially develop by text or social media. Are you kidding me? I would be more concerned about academic development, but these are difficult times that require great sacrifice. There are those who just do not want to make any sacrifice and don't believe this virus is as bad as they say, or that it exists at all."

So, what would happen if we disconnect all of it from money.  After all, if all of the money that existed today just vanished, would all of the food, shelter, air, water, safety and companionship vanish with it?  Of course the first response I would expect you can't have any of it without money... but that isn't true now is it. What system would support filling the needs of people without requiring money?

Now, if money wasn't a part of the equation when asking the question of"" should you reopen schools?""...what is your answer now?  If it is different, it means that you are sacrificing your children and the school systems personnel either by inflicting death or long term physical illness."
2020-07-11 20:43:36,"Why not make the necessary investment to do mandatory, universal, periodic testing of students, teachers, and staff? It would not totally eliminate the risks but would greatly reduce them and limit the spread of the disease caused by open schools. Even better, extend the testing regime to all family members living with students, teachers, and staff. Are we too stingy to take such precautions? It’s not a matter of new technology, just a matter of putting our backs into creating the necessary facilities and trained personnel."
2020-07-11 20:45:26,"The available data (some of which the article references) makes very clear:

- Young kids (<11 or so) don't really transmit or get sick.
- Older kids can transmit but unlikely to get v. sick

A straightforward solution would seem to be:

- Grades 6 and under attend school in-person, with low-risk educators and staff in the building. In-building teachers and staff minimize their own adult-to-adult interaction. 

- Grades 7-12 attend school virtually with higher-risk educators and staff supervising and guiding

Children in grades 7 and above should be self-sufficient and require less (if any) parental oversight (at least not the minute-to-minute kind a 1st grader requires). 

Middle and high schools can be repurposed for use by grades K-6 to allow increased social distancing.  

The current proposals (2 days/wk., etc.) seem like the kind of compromise arrived at when opinions and emotions are being considered more strongly than data."

2020-07-11 21:00:18,Recently a summer camp for young teens  with mostly outdoor activities opened in southern Missouri.  Disinfected bathrooms and dining was promised.  Camp closed days early and kids were sent home from a normal two week stay.  Later 41 campers and counselors tested positive for Covid.  Soon after that the number of positives doubled to 82.  This was reported by NPR and CNN.  Does anyone think that sending kids and teachers back to school will result in a different outcome?
2020-07-11 21:03:16,"The article says young kids are not at risk and don’t appear to transmit the virus.  Amazingly, from the comments, it’s almost like the article doesn’t say that.  
This is not a singular observation of that fact. It was the conclusion in Wuhan back in February when China stated that “kids don’t get it”. It’s not just Norway, its every country in Europe and Canada and Brazil, even here at home, in NYC in early Spring when the virus was unchecked and rampant in the city… and even with no precautions in place, the data suggests that schools were not spreading grounds for the virus, teachers were not infected at higher rates than any other profession and where they were infected it appears to have spread to the school via the teachers not the other way.  
Some people won’t believe in climate change until they see the ice caps melt with their own eyes.  Let’s not wait until the ice caps melt to do what’s right for our kids.  

You can not use an outlier instance or demand the impossible 'proof of absence' to make a policy decision. Inarguably young kids are the safest demographic.  They cannot be asked to pay the highest price of anyone in society. Society doesn’t get to go eat at restaurants and shop at malls and frolic at beaches all documented points of transmission while kids of a tender age sit in a room with a computer to talk to all day.  

Among the things America doesn’t do right lets add have appropriate priorities.  And Dems better get on the right side of this quick."
2020-07-11 21:03:22,"Serious question:why not cancel school this year?  I've been frustrated at the teachers unwillingness to come back, but I also understand where they are coming from.  As a parent, why don't we consider the option of simply having your respective student's grade resume in...2021?  I would personally rather have my kid graduate at age 19 with a complete education than see another science lab experiment year of online learning.

What happens if 2 or 3 more teachers get sick during that time? If this doesnt go away by september we are all going to be in for a eide"
2020-07-11 17:19:41,Is anyone going to point out that every model tells us the outbreak in the fall and winter is going to be many times worse than this one? Why on earth would we send kids back to school precisely when the danger is greatest? Shut down schools at least until next March.
2020-07-11 19:28:42,"All we have to do is alternate weeks — and the pandemic will end. 

Not alternate days. Alternate WEEKS! 

We do not have to cancel school — shouldn’t necessary — school is good. 

From the day of infection, the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th days (esp the 5th, 6th, and 7th) are the most important days to avoid having the contagious in school... because the virus has a 6 day incubation on average.

Simply alternate weeks (or if you want less, instead do a 4day week then a full week off).

If we alternate the students in 1-day cycles or 2-day cycles or half-weeks, that won’t work -- virus continues to spread, the situation falls apart, and the school declares remote-learning 100% within a few weeks later -- and that doesn't work for anyone. Nothing good comes from a rotation that doesn’t work, it won't persist.

2020-07-11 17:20:10,"My advice to teachers and school staff who are ordered to go back to in-class teaching after Labor Day is, do whatever you need to to stay safe for the first 2-3 weeks, such as:

*Wear an n95 mask if you have one.

*Distance from students, no matter what the exigency.

*If a student starts misbehaving or needs closer contact, call school security or the school nurse.

*If a student has to use the bathroom, call an aide or school security to escort them.

*Forget about any sort of interactive or collaborative teaching and go back to exclusively teaching from the lectern.

*Keep windows wide open, if possible.

*Etc.

After the first 2-3 weeks there will be an outbreak.  It is not a question of whether, only when, and it will probably be sooner than later.

And then parents will demand your district will revert to remote learning for the rest of 2020, if not the full academic year."

The Washington Post has an informative article

""In Finland, when public health researchers combed through test results of children under 16, they found no evidence of school spread and no change in the rate of infection for that age cohort after schools closed in March or reopened in May. In fact, Finland’s infection rate among children was similar to Sweden’s, even though Sweden never closed its schools, according to a report published Tuesday by researchers from the two countries.

In Sweden, researchers also found that staff members at day cares and primary schools were no more likely than people working in other professions to contract the virus.

“It really starts to add up to the fact that the risk of transmission, the number of outbreaks in which the index is a child, is very low, and this seems to be the picture everywhere else,” said Otto Helve, who worked on the report as a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.

He said he sent his own children back to school.""

And after they find that can't get enough children of congress to be volunteered with 3 ft distancing,  and after Trump and Pence and Disantis all decline because they have better things to do than to demonstrate their belief in their own official decrees let's agree going back to school right now is not a good idea.  I'll go so far to say that for some teachers, administrators, janitors, bus drivers and others, this is, in effect, a death sentence.  And then we can do a side by side comparison of how the children will feel because they don't get to socialize as much as they should, in comparison to how they will feel when their favorite teacher is dead because he or she agreed to go to teach their class."

<a href=""http://balancedresponse.ca/open-letter"" target=""_blank"">http://balancedresponse.ca/open-letter</a>/

They clearly state that the measures that have been taken to control the spread of disease represents a more serious threat to health than the threat from Covid 19. 

They state;
-Both the disease and the control measures have had serious consequences for population health and equity.  
-The response to Covid 19 has been unbalanced. 
-In overall population health terms COVID-19’s direct impact on premature mortality is small compared with other risks people assume every day. 
-The fundamental determinants of health - education, employment, social connection and medical care must take priority over measures for COVID-19 control. 
-Control measures are not accommodating the fundamental determinants of health in a society (education, employment, social connection, and medical care).  Children need social interaction and school.  Adults need to work.  The societal costs of maintaining these public health measures, are too high.  
-Childhood development, one of the strongest predictors of life-long health and social outcomes, is being significantly affected on an ongoing basis. 
-The science, data, and evidence does not support these ongoing measures.
- The risk to those who are not elderly with multiple pre-existing medical problems is much lower than what was initially believed."
2020-07-11 18:34:09,"Prudence would be to send small groups back to school, see what happens, keep the largest groups safety at home until results are in and analyzed.

For what, to test unverified pediatric prognostications, to help the economy, to protect political leaders, to obey in fear of the White House madman.

Examples from other countries are not reliably indication of what will happen in the US as shown by the disastrous handling of Covid by those still running the show, making threats, advocating snakeoil treatment, bemoaning exaggerated threats to business, crying hoax, fake, harm to me, the King of Insecurity."
2020-07-11 20:55:59,"The problem with comparing foreign countries to the US, is they are not equal comparisons.  Many nations with positive results had low infection rates and were willing to fund schools sufficiently.  In the US we cram students into small, often poorly ventilated rooms.  The students mix closely with other students in crowded halls, stairwells, bathrooms, and lunchrooms.  And most students travel on crowded buses to get to and from schools.  We have about 30% of staff who have at least one health/age condition that would put them at risk.  We don’t have universal healthcare and do not want to spend the money necessary to keep students safe.  The Trump administration gave money to law firms, lobbying firms, churches, and country clubs but schools face funding cuts if they make the president mad or look bad."

Will dirty masks be sanitized or replaced?
What happens when kids show up in the morning without a mask? What are the penalties for being ""unprepared"" or refusing to wear a mask? How will teachers deal with daily in-class disruptions related to mask wearing? How will mask rules be enforced in the unsupervised areas such as Hallways? Locker rooms? Cafeterias? Bus lines? On buses? during down time before and after school starts? What about teachers who take off masks so that they can be heard? Or the inconsistency in classroom enforcement: lax teachers v, strict teachers?  How about when masks become playthings and punchlines, toys, and even weapons? And what will happen when kids scrawl inappropriate words or pictures on their masks? When kids complain that they can't breath or speak clearly, or their mask is sweaty, dirty, or unsanitary? When kids take a drink at the water fountain - through their masks? And how will the current trend in soft discipline react to all of this in more? 

Administrators, welcome to your worst nightmare."

He called the virus a hoax, then said it would disappear, then created chaos that has caused this deadly disease to rampage through our nation out of control, with numbers of dead growing day by day. Under no other circumstance would we be debating sending our children and our teachers back into this environment. No way, no how. 

Do not be fooled that this is worthy of consideration. If you have the ability, demand distance learning until the US gets its act together. No level of education is worth this risk."

2020-07-11 21:16:56,"I'm currently a high school student; in mid-January, I was struck down with a horrible respiratory illness which ended up leaving me in the hospital. During my first few days of being sick, I still attended school. Of course, I didn't want to: I was miserable. However, not attending would leave me with disciplinary issues and possibly detentions, as I had already used up all of my ""sick"" days. I probably infected others, and I learned absolutely nothing. It's hard to focus on trigonometry when you have a high fever. 

I hope that after we go back to ""normal,"" schools will be much more sympathetic to sick students. Missing days would result in dozens of overdue assignments, missed tests, and judgmental looks from educators."
2020-07-11 21:17:37,"I think the future will hold many other emerging novel viruses, and this country is going to have to start strategizing. We need to bring back health infrastructure within the schools, like we used to have. Interagency cooperation is imperative.

We need to trust our institutions. I don't think teachers trust the system, and neither do parents. That's one of the reasons why there's so much push back to schools reopening. If we had more trust, maybe there would be an eager and robust education work force ready to go back.

We do have to remember that there is more than one interpretation of ""our most vulnerable"". If we do not provide some kind of timely education for a part of the population, then we may be exposing them exponentially to their particular social, environmental and learning vulnerabilities of the future, and a virus may be the least of them. 

Incorporating a fast covid test is a start. None of this ""results in 7-12 days"" nonsense. Good luck---this is rough all around. Fresh air? How many US school windows don't even open, or even exist? Every locality will have vast issues, sometimes from block to block. This isn't a one size fits all problem, yet trump will make another blanket proclamation to win votes.

A careful, quantitative determination of this matter is critically necessary with respect to high school students.  And forget social distancing for that population; their brains are hard-wired to override any such regimentation.  It should also be noted that distance learning for high school students doesn't necessitate parents staying home to the same degree as for young children."

Would we sacrifice the education of a generation to save 100,000 lives? Much harder question. It’s time to think about this, and to analyze the probabilities."
2020-07-11 21:24:43,"The article notes that other countries that have opened schools had controlled the community spread first, and still limit class size to 10 to 15 kids. We are a long way from containing this even with the schools closed now. As for 10 kids per class? This will never happen in the U.S. The schools are crowded and can barely pay for the teachers they have. Who is going to pay for 2 or 3 times more teachers? Are there even enough teachers and classroom space to make this happen even if we could pay for it? Are we going to teach science in tents? How do you have band  with 10 of 200 band members? When someone gets sick, what's the protocol? Shut down that class for 2 weeks? Ignore it? Proposals to open the schools never address these issues."
2020-07-11 19:51:37,"In Denmark (5.8 million) we on average do 15K tests daily, on 10k previously untested people - the 5k are tests for recovery, retests and routine test of frontline staff. We discover between 10 and 30 new cases daily. That is a positive rate of 0.1 - 0.3%. Kindly compare these numbers to the US rates of 10 -25%, and then consider the risks involved. ( hint - the risk is not a linear product of infections rates, but exponential ).

No one in Europe would even consider reopening schools with the US numbers. The small kids might be low risk, but they are not immune, and they can transmit the virus, though likely at a much reduced rate. Teachers will be very vulnerable in the current US viral environment.

So far Norway and Denmark has gradually reopened nurseries and schools while managing to keep the community spread down. If our case numbers starts to rise again the policies will be adjusted, long before a new lock-down is needed. We know we are balancing a tight rope, and the balance must continue for a rather long time.

We constantly look abroad for knowledge sharing and learning, and workable ideas from other nations are tested and adopted if beneficial. But then again, we are small nations considered ""socialist hellholes"" by Trump and his Fox-News ayatollahs, so we are hardly relevant for large parts of the US."

But, there ready is not sufficient research to determine the extent of COVID on children. We know that some children have experienced COVID related MIC-S, which causes multifaceted breakdowns with them. More research is needed here. 

I was disappointed today seeing the lines to enter DisneyWorld. School aged children shown pulling their face masks down below their noses and mouths. How hard will it be for teachers to monitor mitigation while attempting to teach class? If a teacher can get 30 or so children to maintain effective mitigation measures, they deserve triple their salaries."

2020-07-11 18:18:32,"Psychological damage can be treated. But you kind of have to be alive to treat it. 

I’m flummoxed that The New York Times has failed to report on the reality of the situation. It’s going to take billions to get the schools buildings ready for COVID precautions. Teachers who have to buy their own cleaning supplies (some in the poorest schools even have to buy toilet paper and soap), know that these billions will not come. And yet, teachers are being thrust into this nightmare anyway. Most are terrified to go back. Do their lives not matter?

Beyond that, most parents would rather keep their kids safe at home than send them in an environment full of hazards. Just ask them. If they had the money to keep their kids at home, they would. So what we’re doing is sacrificing teachers so that the government doesn’t have to acknowledge that it needs to financially help working parents through this pandemic. It’s perfectly fine to Trump to ask parents to choose between a job and their child. This should never be happening in America. 

The next article I read about school openings had better have its feet firmly planted on the ground. Otherwise I may just have to write one myself."
2020-07-11 16:43:41,"Please ... I'm a physician, we can not open schools, one of the biggest concerns with children is that we don't know if being reinfected over and over is going to cause them to react in the same manner as older adults. Remember, we were told that young adults were nearly immune, now they're being seriously infected and dying. Dare I say that the same thing will beset those of our youngest population.

If you love your kids, keep 'em home. If you love you kids, demand more from our government. Look what Black Lives Matter accomplished, can you imagine millions of middle-class Americans showing up in front of their state capitals and in Washington DC???

At the very least, we don't need our kids respecting the fellow students by wearing a mask, we need masks for our kids that will keep THEM safe from infection.  Now, if you've decided on sending your kids to school, consider masks along with eye protection. This is not about keeping our children safe, but keeping them alive. Be safe out there my friends."

2020-07-11 18:04:18,"By now, most of us can tell that in the midst of this pandemic, there is too much rationalizing in the face of inconvenient truths. Many of our leaders have also begun speaking and acting under politically motivated duress! 

Throughout this ordeal, it's the medical professionals who have risked their own lives and in good faith, consistently pushed back against anyone who downplays the facts. That's because they've seen it firsthand and they understand the gravity and the repercussions better than anyone! When it comes to weighing options, it's the medical community that should prevail along with common sense and reason. 

Opening up our schools isn't going to contain the virus, so clearly the agenda is not to prevent spread or to save lives....and shouldn't that be the number one priority?  Yet here we are, listening to misguided pretexts that will put children, their teachers and a lot of other good people in harms way!"
2020-07-11 17:01:17,"School districts & teachers will be jumping through hoops this year to keep students & staff safe. My district has spent plenty of $$ purchasing gallons of hand sanitizer, masks, table dividers, signs, gloves, etc., etc.  A thoughtful plan has been conceived with students coming in half days for at least a month and staying in cohorts. No lunch in school, no extracurriculars, no parents/volunteers in building.  As of now, no one will be tested prior to opening day in September, which I think is a huge mistake. In the end, all the thoughtful plans and containers of disinfecting wipes in the world  won’t mean a thing unless staff enforces “the rules” (no moving around the room, no sharing of pens, wearing masks when not behind a divider, etc.) and parents enforce strict social distancing. That’s not happening, folks. At 12:30 p.m.(or whenever the school day will ends in Anytown, USA), kids are gonna be kids - play dates are happening, as are parties & “study groups.”  As a previous poster said, it’s just a matter of time before the virus shows up at the school door. And back to online learning we will all go."
2020-07-11 16:55:10,"Children are not test subjects. By now, if we just look around, we should be able to conclude humbly that we don't yet know what we are doing when it comes to the virus and that every bet on reopening indoor activities has gone horribly wrong.

2020-07-11 20:21:39,"My impression, based on photos I have seen of places where schools have reopened, like Denmark,  is that there are at least two things that distinguish them from us and make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to reopen: (1) more real estate, that is, more classrooms, churches, halls or other community spaces where split up classes can go and (2) shared community values (which is also why they have also things like universal health care, child care. paid  family leave, et.)."
2020-07-11 17:21:34,"Since we need to keep this story line of schools being safe, the opening will go like this.

2020-07-11 19:36:42,"Everything I've read makes it seem that every plan being considered is just one variation among many plans, all with the common characteristic of being half-baked and arbitrary.  I guess the one that makes the least sense to me is the notion of delaying school opening for another month or two. Nothing will have changed, unless maybe we will start to see whether any of the other plans have failed. I'm still baffled by the fact that we have no reliable estimate of prevalence of infection in the community, anywhere. There needs to be a systematic, ongoing program of random testing to get a sense of how many people are infected. All our data so far come from people who think they might be sick, or think they might have been exposed, or who are curious and have the time and resources to get themselves tested. I want to know what percentage of the entire population (or any chosen sub-population, such as school kids) is carrying the infection, week by week."

Now we have a far bigger problem than the usual colds and flu, and far too little experience with COVID-19 to anticipate what might keep our children safe in school.  We are only beginning to understand how this disease spreads, and how children are affected and what part they play in this pandemic.

The Trump Administration, and the Republican Party has let us down at every turn, with numbers of infections increasing daily by leaps and bounds and deaths ramping up again as the first wave morphs into a second and hospitals in multiple locations become overwhelmed.  Our country is literally one of the worst places in the world to be during this pandemic.

This could have been different, but our country is adrift with a corrupt and irresponsible government.

There is no plan for the safety of our children; they are only cogs in the economic wheel to this evil Administration, which is as happy as not to sacrifice them and their families for economic gain.

Under these circumstances, sending children back to school is nothing short of children criminal.

Wait -- now the white teachers who are ordering delivery sushi from their student's dad who is an undocumented delivery man, don't want to teach those Latino and Black kids in person.  Because they didn't sign up to put their lives at risk when they signed up to be a teacher.

2020-07-11 18:03:17,"“But there is enormous pressure to bring students back — from parents, from pediatricians and child development specialists, and from President Trump.”

Why is there enormous pressure? Because this godless  administration would rather sacrifice this country’s teachers than pay working parents Universal Basic Income so that they don’t have to choose between a job and their child. That’s it. Period the end. This is why teachers are so angry right now. What is a teacher’s life worth?

Look at any given state department of education website’s job board. In Alabama, we have 18 pages of jobs. 1,800 jobs. Normally this time of year, with school starting in less than a month, we have 9 or 10 pages. Almost TWICE AS MANY POSTED JOBS. And they’re not new positions. Nor are they virtual positions. These are jobs that veteran teachers have said “Yeah, no thanks, I’ll sit this one out.” Systems that never have jobs this time of year are alight with postings. 

So here we are, scrambling to find enough teachers, when the average school can’t even find enough substitutes on any given day. All because Trump has decided that he couldn’t care less about teachers or the kids whose parents have no choice but to send them back to rundown spaces that are certainly not prepared to keep them safe during this pandemic. One of my friends, teaching now about 10 years, said, “I just hope the soap dispensers in the restrooms will finally get filled.”

2020-07-11 16:20:01,"NYC is a different beast.  Under Bloomberg, community schools went out the door and students, especially middle and high school students take public transportation to get to school; the surge of ridership will certainly allow the virus to spread.  More importantly, at least in NYC, the DOE was extremely dishonest about COVID-19 in March; the deep cleaning in March was a joke (in my school, janitors wiped door knobs).   NYC has not ever properly funded education.  Buildings are mostly a mess and outdated.  Most have rodent and insect infestations and are fairly dirty.  Bathrooms are substandard and lack proper sinks for handwashing and paper towels have historically been in short supply (at least where I work).   Schools are overcrowded and small classrooms that should only fit 15 kids at most have 34 in them.   As for Dr. Edwards saying it will damage kids if they don't go to school.  She forgot that there are adults in the building.  How damaging will it be if the adults in the building are out for extensive periods of time due to illness (Good luck getting a sub) or worse, if they die.   Many NYC teachers and other staff members, including a principal in her 30's, died of COVID-19.  If we can't have indoor dining, why would indoor schooling work?

While torn about sending her to school, our lack of federal leadership and funding for schools has placed all of the risk on parents, teachers, and communities. We are already having and have had conversations with our daughter about:
1) Going back to school will look different this year.
2) Hand washing, sanitizing and why wearing a mask is safe for everyone. 

I fully predict that school shutdowns will begin in October around fall break, definitely by Christmas break when college partying, flu and coronavirus come together in the winter months making cases re-surge.

Accessible testing and quick tests should be the number one priority for states and localities as we go into the school year. If schools and localities can conduct adequate the levels of testing, this will mitigate the risk that cases go undetected and run rampant throughout schools. If not, we will soon be back to online learning until they try again in Spring 2020."
2020-07-11 21:50:26,"Well researched and written article, appreciated, will be helpful for many."
2020-07-11 21:57:46,"To open schools safely, we MUST have frequent (say weekly) testing, of ALL students and school personnel. With 24 hr turnaround, not a week or two!

Pool testing could work - combine samples from a few classrooms or a grade together, then test individuals if a pool comes back positive.

We've been careful about social distancing, keeping a limited 'bubble' with his dad and grandparents, and none of us has had cold or a fever since mid-March. 

Contrast that to early this year - at times, over half my son's class was out sick! One or both of us, constantly sick. Teachers often visibly ill. 3 separate trips to the dr for him (spaced over 6 weeks), with two weeks of school missed due to flu symptoms, including a terrible cough. (He was only ever tested for whooping cough, neg no surprise.) 

Me - horrible cough, up to 102 fever, aches etc finally treated as bacterial pneumonia secondary to unspecified viral infection. I'd had the flu shot. I'm a runner, thin, normally healthy and I was knocked flat.

So, assume he goes back to school in the fall. If we all start getting sick again, without testing, how do we know if it's a cold, flu, or coronavirus? 

Community spread is pervasive here and testing is still not readily available. Without effective testing and quarantine, I fear the virus will spread like wildfire."
2020-07-11 21:58:27,"Some parents will do anything to get a babysitter -- even let their kids play in the middle of a freeway. Of course ""there is some uncertainty"" about whether kids playing in the middle of a freeway will be harmed or cause accidents as drivers swerve to avoid them, because it's never been done before. But the best way to find out is to try. At if it works parents will be able to go back to work -- at least until freeway time is over and the kids have to play on an airport runway (AKA daycare center.)"
2020-07-11 21:59:53,"When some supposed expert says ""There is really damage to kids if they don’t go to school"", when if adequately educated he would say there is real damage or there really is damage, I might have a higher level of confidence in what he is trying to communicate, as opposed to being distracted by improper grammar. That said, ""Have to get kids back to school"" and ""getting them back safely"" may be mutually exclusive given how our of control the outbreak has become. If we have 60-70 thousand new infections documented each day, there are probably at least 2-3 times that given that testing is grossly inadequate and test positivity rates are high."
2020-07-11 22:10:00,"The pressure to open schools in person is NOT as intense from parents and teachers as it is from the president. 

I wish this article really reflected what parents and teachers are feeling. Most, by far, do not feel safe.

If there is a hybrid teaching model (where there is some in-person teaching) before the cases come down and widespread testing is available, that’s just as deadly as fully in-person teaching. 

 A teacher/students can get sick in one day just as easily as they can in five.  *Once the teacher gets sick, who’s going to teach evwn the online classes?* It is dangerous to open AT ALL until the cases come down drastically."
2020-07-11 22:11:52,"I teach in an ""urban school"" of 2,700 high school students. I have no earthly idea how we are going to reopen in September, and neither do my school administrators.  

I'm anxious to get back...I have never worked harder than I did during remote learning. But if you want to spread a virus, plant it in a school.  You can practically watch it travel from one end of the building to the other. 

In the younger grades, good luck with masks and social distancing.  Have you seen the size of the rooms they cram 25 kids into? Have you experienced the ventilation systems in public schools? We don't have enough custodians to do a light cleaning, never mind going deep.

I feel bad for parents who want their kids out from underfoot, but teachers aren't babysitters. If all we're doing is policing masks, enforcing distancing and attending to predictable adolescent behaviors, no learning will be going on. (Some of my students did much better remotely than they did by being in class.) 

Instead of finding ways to swing the doors open, we should be looking at ways to get students the technology they need for remote learning. When we have a vaccine - load up the buses (another huge problem).

If we can bail out Tom Brady, we can get a laptop into the hands of a third grader."
2020-07-11 22:17:47,"I would  do anything possible to prevent my children from become infected. My heart heart hurts for the parents who must choose between affording  the basic necessities or putting their children in school. 

Some will tap out their savings or seriously deplete their retirement funds. Others don’t even have that safety net. We do not know the long term consequences for children who contract this virus. 

Other countries have provided the financial support to allow 
parents to choose virtual options, if desired. I missed a year and a half of grade school due to illness. I caught up and it was not so difficult. Summer break  helped. My parents helped me catch up. ( after work). It is do-able."
2020-07-11 22:22:03,"Speaking as a high school teacher, reopening feels like a really bad idea to me. I walk around my school and find kids making out anywhere that they might be alone for a second. Soap is rarely in the bathrooms and when it is there, kids often break open the dispensers or squirt it all over the floor. Even when the bathrooms have soap, they regularly have to be closed because kids are getting stoned. What's more, most of the teaching strategies I rely on include giving students time to figure things out together as lecturing is honestly one of the least effective teaching strategies. 

If a hybrid model is adopted, am I expected to teach both to my kids in the class and kids online at the same time? Does that mean that I need to stay still throughout the class? Because that means I lose my ability to use proximity - my most valuable class management strategy. It also means that if I have a student who is struggling, I can't really go over and work with that individual student without being unable to see half my class. 

Let's also talk about passing period. My school has around 2000 students. During passing periods moving through the hallways is like wading through a sea of molasses. And you can't put all the kids in one place and have the teachers move to the kids because the kids are not all in the same classes. 

I simply don't see how reopening can be done safely while retaining decent instruction. And worse, as no one is telling me what is happening, I can't plan."
2020-07-11 22:25:34,"Online is the way. Online is the present and the future. Instead of returning to a bygone era of bricks and mortar infected and polluted with lethal disease, double, triple, and quadruple down on making online work. Invest in distributing more and more powerful technology and learn more each day how to improve the experience. The idea that a social life is impossible for children online is belied hourly by how much time they  communicate with their friends on their phones, who may be next door or thousands of miles away. Virtual reality, augmented reality, faster, cheaper, more powerful and more secure electronic delivery is appropriate and fitting for right now, and tomorrow. Ignore those who do not want this advancement and who would rather expose the world and themselves to COVID unnecessarily -- what would they doing in education, if they aren't on board with moving forward instead of back?"
2020-07-11 22:29:40,"Note how antibody testing has falled out of the US News cycle / public health policy discussions on the epidemic.  A big part of understanding where things are with specific sub-populations, the actual risks, as well as modelling latent infectiousness, depends on robust antibody studies, something that is not being pursued now that the NY antibody studies are over.  In Ohio, an MD cannot even order an antibody study to allow individuals who have recovered from ""flu-like symptoms"" but was not tested for COVID-19, to determine what the risk is to their own person of going about normal activities. Instead the news cycle lost focus (or shifted focus to its usual social justice bent, and has now put the race-based lenses on regarding its reporting of covid, e.g., NY Times article on Morehouse vs. Clemson's sports).  The people holding the reins for the USA, whose scientific prowess must at this time be seriously questioned, doubled down on the propaganda effort regarding masks, public control orders, and narc-your-neighbor.  
The discussion MUST shift back to anti-body testing, with an eye to how we are undermining the acquisition of herd immunity by prolonging the epidemic in the USA with draconian social distance and lockdown just as long or longer than the Euopean exemplars that policy makers now use to criticize how the USA is ""out of control""."
2020-07-11 22:36:40,In Sweden a study shows that teachers did not get sick to a higher extent than other job categories even if schools (up to 10th grade) never closed and continued business as usual. Bus- and taxidriver was hit the hardest with the virus (excluding hospital workers). There are many similar studies in Europe. Norway admits it was a misstake to close the school (they have now reopened).
2020-07-11 22:46:39,"Secondary Teacher here. We went back to a blend of remote and in class teaching 7 weeks ago. No school access to parents, no access before and after school for students. We teach our classes then go home, so timetables are somewhat flexible to allow this model. I teach seniors so we made Friday a no class day and the building is empty. Older staff over 65 remain remote teaching and we have classrooms set up for those sessions so that students come to the room and they are supervised by an ‘extra’ teacher (paid for by the state not the school). Hand sanitiser stations everywhere in the building, staff desks - every second desk is vacant (I’m one of those desks and I just find a quite empty room/space). Everyone keeps social distance except the students with each other. Some of my students are online whilst I am teaching a class so they can hear the lesson and participate in group work. The students loved being back and there is no substitute for real time teaching (feedback, in particular, is essential for learning progress and this was the hardest part of online lessons). We’re about to go back to this model after our term break. I urge American colleagues to embrace a return to classroom learning, with modifications to suit their students and staff. Addressing the lost learning time must be a matter of urgency for educators. Honestly, the hardest part is My train commute! It’s the only time I feel worried so I shall be wearing masks and not touching any surface."
2020-07-11 23:00:01,"We should open Schools now, in July for a select few who are older, more responsible, honor students living close by their school building.   These test students should be frequently tested.  They will be the pioneers who help to collect the data we need to make intelligent new paradigms for opening  up to more students later in the year.
School buildings are empty now.  Why are we waiting?  There is nothing magical about Labor Day."
2020-07-11 21:48:14,"As a retired teacher of four decades, barring a miraculous event,  I am sorry to tell everyone that the next school year is already lost.  The time to prepare for a pandemic classroom was months ago with a nation-wide plan and a federal infusion of cash to implement safety in the classroom on par with what was spent to keep big corporations afloat.

Local school districts will do their best given the lousy cards they have been dealt, but will have to shut things down again because,

 - Older staff are getting sick and/or dying.
 - There is a huge shortage of qualified teachers willing to become martyrs.
 - Parents will send their sick kids to school, just as they have for generations.

There is no solution to getting back to anywhere near normal without spending hundreds of billions of dollars.  Even if you don’t care about students learning, there is no full economic recovery without schools being in session.  Unfortunately, the financial and health well being of school-age families are not a priority of the Republicans, executive or congressional, so no financial support is going to happen anytime soon.

Given this scenario, the upcoming school year is lost before it even begins."
2020-07-11 22:44:23,"The Republican administration has put America's parents in a horrifying bind. Had this virus been taken seriously from the beginning (or - gasp - even prepared for) perhaps we would have found ourselves in the position to reopen the schools. Instead, it is literally news today that after 136,000 deaths, the President of the United States has deigned to wear a mask in public. 

I remember a time pretty recently where one could have friends of all political persuasions, but the complicity of the Republicans here is unforgiveable. I will never forget how this feels: having every person I know living with unbearable anxiety and fear, an American passport being barely more than a piece of paper, and our children being used as pawns. Never."

2020-07-11 22:06:50,"I recommend that NYT reporters get someone with knowledge of German to listen to Dr. Christian Drosten’s podcast on the coronavirus. He talked about the same French study and showed how its numbers are not so clear cut. Those who were tested had motivation to do so, which skews the antibody results. A true scientist does not view studies such as these as pure fact. He ended the last podcast with an important question. We need to discuss: What does it mean for teachers and school staff that we cannot have virus-free schools? If we start the discussion with that important question, and include teachers, staff, and their unions in this discussion, it might be more productive instead of pretending they don’t exist, or as if we can actually create virus free schools."

2020-07-11 22:23:56,"I would be interested in examining why Israel had to re-close schools, due to outbreaks, but Denmark (and other countries) didn't. 

Was the virus more under control in the countries that didn't have an outbreak after reopening? 

Could it be climate related?  Presumably Israel is hotter and schools probably need a/c whereas they probably don't in northern European countries.

In any case, this country is in the middle of a full blown crisis and even thinking about opening schools in most parts of this country is simply crazy.  As usual, we are putting the cart before the horse."
2020-07-11 22:39:27,"If we were handling this as smartly as we should, then maybe we could begin experimenting with different “safe” school ideas. 

Either way I suspect some state will try it, I suggest one change. Those adults who are pushing to open schools, get to role play all scenarios until there is scientific evidence that it is safe. 

Don’t use our children as guinea pigs. If you want to move the economy that bad, go volunteer to make sure our future generations are safe.


I fully understand all the troubles this makes for primarily those who have to work, the poor, middle-class, all those who’ve lost jobs. And, the disparities once again seeing the black/POC communities, experiencing more: poverty, more risky jobs, illness & death than the white community.


And, shame on you pediatricians who agree with your association. Children are resilient. But, not to exposure of a virus over & over. I’m a testament to that. As well as millions of children around the world who have lived through wars, displacement, etc. Parents should try to relax their standards a bit, spend time with your child and learn something together if you are blessed to have that financial opportunity. Congress, people are looking to you to provide more federal assistance. Don’t let them down.

Opening schools is among the least of our problems. The fact that since the Black Death during the Dark Ages that we haven't come any further than masks and social distancing as the pandemic response is pretty humbling and pathetic at the same time.

Unless and until we have a safe and effective vaccine and/or therapeutics nothing else matters. Money doesn't matter to dead people.

Don't we have child psychologists and other knowldegeable people around who can shed some insight on how kids interact with one another?

2020-07-11 23:33:51,"It will be very expensive to safely restart schools in many areas (namely, all the areas that have any significant levels of Covid infection). The temptation, in fact the political push, is and will be to restart despite the safety guidelines being much weaker than needed, and without even those being strictly followed or enforced.

2020-07-11 23:40:06,"I live in Vermont, one of the two states seeing steady decreases in COVID cases, due to a lot of shared social agreements arounds mask wearing and social distancing, and incredible leadership from the governor on a slow and careful reopening. From this starting point (which seems the only place we should be talking about reopening schools), as a grade school teacher and mother of three grade-school-age children, I have two thoughts:
1. Children need face-to-face social interactions much more than adults do; parents and teachers have been seeing rising levels of anxiety and depression among children, from early childhood through adolescence. There is a mental health crisis brewing that we are just becoming aware of and that is going to have long-lasting effects; this worries me more than the academic losses.  
2.  Children are incredibly adaptable and will deal well with the new conditions in schools (when it is safe enough in each area to open them). In the elementary academic summer camps we are now running at our school, I see children masking, social distancing and following new routines of frequent handwashing and not sharing supplies. It's not perfect, but new habits are possible. They are SO happy to see each other that they are highly motivated to follow the rules and all these strange new practices quickly have become routine."
2020-07-11 23:55:16,"No amount of money will build enough additional classroom space to provide for the necessary social distancing required by September 1st. It's already too late. There aren't enough contractors or available portable units in stock. Reducing the transmission rate was the first step in opening schools and the economy. It didn't happen, and the person responsible wants to blame the teachers."
2020-07-11 23:55:56,"I urge everyone to think of school personnel, teachers, and students, as people, NOT as experiment subjects. These are lives, and we should never take a risk with lives. 

There will be a (rather extensive) learning loss. While I believe that education is one of the most important things; consider the elderly teachers that will be sacrificed if we re-open schools, or the grand-parent that will fall ill after their grand-child infects them, or the high-risk child that becomes dangerously ill when their sibling brings the virus home from school. 

Schools should not re-open in the fall. 

The lives of millions of people should always be prioritized over in-school learning. 

What we need now, is finding a way to work with what we've got. Make online-learning better, and more effective. Find a way to engage students online, and lessen the severity of the learning loss."
2020-07-12 00:04:17,"I teach in one of our overseas military dependent schools in South Korea which has been closed since February and my colleagues and I just shake our heads at the reckless, selfish, and uninformed response of so many of our fellow Americans to the pandemic. Despite residing in a nation which has made a concerted, largely successful effort to meet the pandemic head-on in close coordination with USFK command, even we are somewhat wary of reopening this fall. But to put kids in harm's way in states where community spread runs rampant is indefensible. The White House and many state governors need to wake up to the hard realities and stop playing politics with people's health and well-being. Enough is enough."
2020-07-12 00:29:49,"I’m totally against reopening schools now because we know EXACTLY what’s going to happen. As a Washington Post author put it, how do you get a 6 year old who has the attention span of a squirrel to socially distance? (Actually, squirrels seem far more focused on their survival.)

Compared to private school, most K-12 public education is a sham (not my words but from an extremely socially conscious lawyer whose daughter attended private school--& she said it out of concern). 

For a few years I went to Goddard College, where from January- February students left campus for a “work term” (I realize that sounds elitist for students who don’t have the luxury of working in college as a choice). Yet many colleges require unpaid internships to supposedly give students ""real world"" experience they can't get in class.  

It might or might not solve the childcare issue but what about canceling the academic year in a favor a “gap year” of community service? The logistics would be daunting but not more than for in-person school. What if socially distanced young adults could safely chaperone kids out of doors to deliver food to the elderly & needy, sweep the sidewalk, walk dogs for people who need to stay inside for their health (IF the dogs behave)? 

We need to enlist kids in the equivalent of a wartime effort to save the country. Taking action & volunteering offsets anxiety. Moral education is probably far more important, or at least that's what all the college mission statements say."

I am so tired of going for a walk in my neighborhood, hiking along a trail,  popping into the grocery/pharmacy store, walking along a beach, even visiting a medical office only to find myself constantly avoiding a)children/youths in these areas who congregate in groups with no social distancing and no masks  or b) parents who have to drag them along wherever they go.
While they obviously have no concern for themselves,  they SHOULD have more consideration for others around them.

The governor, via a constitutionally questionable emergency power, shut down school buildings,not schools, under what are powers of the commissioner of health. The schools remained operational, although some did a better job than others at distance learning. So the issue is opening school buildings and as with opening any building where the business is functioning without it, the question has to he why? for what benefits? clearly there are benefits. I'm not questioning those. But how far we go with opening buildings has to be how much opening for how much benefit. There is probably and 80/20 rule here where it is 20% open gets you 80% of the benefits. Maybe the kids never change rooms. The teachers change rooms and all kids are put one of a few tracks. This way they are only exposed to 30 other kids not 3000 other kids."
2020-07-12 01:23:42,"Forget the CDC restrictions on testing and start testing every student, employee, parent, volunteer that comes to school so this nation can finally get a true sense of our national infection rate and begin to have better information than the paltry statistics we've been studying. Opening schools demands testing. This will also pave the way for vaccinating the nation."
2020-07-12 01:26:47,"When Trump sends Barron and all his grandchildren to public school this fall, then he can demand that everyone else do the same. Until then, like so much Trump does, it’s just political posturing."
2020-07-12 01:35:05,"Schools are essential institutions and teachers are essential workers. Where infection rates are the lowest in the country (New York), and have been for some weeks, it would be incredibly bizarre for schools not to be open in September, with safety protocols instituted, when almost every other workplace and job category, except mass entertainment, will be back at work."
2020-07-12 01:39:02,"""Keeping schools closed for a prolonged stretch has worrisome implications for social and academic development, child development experts say.""

Are permanently scarred lungs, damaged hearts, and orphanhood a problem for the kids' social and academic development?  It'll be safe enough to send kids back to school when it's safe enough for Paul Manafort to be sent back to prison."
2020-07-12 02:06:51,"Firstly let the teachers have the biggest say in this more than anyone else.
Secondly, remember about 25% of teachers have risk factors that can make them really sick if they catch covid. 
Only open schools in areas where the test positivity is less than 1%.
Test all the kids, parents, teachers, school bus drivers and school staff at least once and more often depending on experience.
All wear masks and eye protection - students maybe difficult.
Have classes outdoors weather permitting if that is possible.
Have kids meet in open playgrounds during recess and not hallways. 
After all it is the social interaction that the kids are missing and not really the classes. 
And it takes money to reduce class sizes.Pass a bill like the GI bill once for all for education - long due!!
Finally, If we can share hospital beds across a region is it a big ask to share classrooms across a region?"
2020-07-12 02:20:30,"Let’s prove how important it is to get students back in the traditional, physical classroom by doing whatever it takes to get the coronavirus under control first. Whatever it takes. So far, my state hasn’t done much of anything, and now it’s doing even less of that. No way would I send a child of mine back to a Georgia school this August."
2020-07-12 02:27:50,"The studies of countries that have reopened schools successfully are interesting, but beg the question. In general, those are countries that have done the hard work of getting the virus under control on the one hand, and value education for its intrinsic importance on the other. Americans, by contrast, have rushed to reopen everything and ‘get back to normal’ before the virus was controlled in their communities. And much of what we are hearing about reopening schools is for the wrong reason: to keep children occupied during the day so their parents can go back to work. Americans simply are not mature enough to do this."
2020-07-12 02:29:37,"When schools open there will be students, teachers and parents that will die as a result. It's statistically inevitable. Let's start the conversation with that and then see how it progresses from there."
2020-07-12 02:36:55,"One of the results of this epidemic is that it has shown that America has no imagination.  The title of the article begins with ""How to Reopen Schools.""  Schools can reopen next year with an innovative rethinking of remote learning.  The real issue for everyone seems to be how to get students back in classroom seats.  This goal seems partly  to be a selfish adherence to a fear of change.

As an educator, I always become excited as the start of the school year approaches.  All is fresh and new.  I am honored to be in a position to ""guide"" over 100 new human beings - moving in and out of my classroom each day - though the most challenging period in their development.  However, this year, I feel nothing but anxiety and fear for me and my future students.

Instead of writing article after article about how to reopen schools, let's expend energy placing our collective IQ on creating Remote Learning models that are robust and innovative while addressing equity and access.  

Teachers, Silicon Valley, esteemed colleges of education, researchers, and other stakeholders should be moving full steam ahead with new Best Practices.    I am not just thinking of a curriculum package, but a rethinking of how we deliver a new system of education for the technological age.   That we found ourselves deep in a pandemic with no plan is baffling.  That we continue to not see this moment as an opportunity is baffling."
2020-07-12 02:45:36,"The decision to reopen should be contingent on the percent of infected people in the community.  When infection rates are high as in the U.S., schooling should not be in-person. Rates have to be brought down to the single digits first.

Nobody knows the long-term consequences of infection. The newest research suggests a possibility of lasting brain and other organ damage. As with the discovery of post-polio syndrome long after the original polio epidemic subsided, we cannot assess the long-term effects of Covid-19 infection on children and should not risk their well-being by putting them back in classrooms now.

Despite concerns raised by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), research shows that children are extremely resilient in the face of trauma and adversity when they have a secure attachment relationship with at least one parental figure. There is no reason to assume that another semester or two of distance learning will permanently damage children even though many will experience temporary setbacks academically and socially.

The notion that testing will be adequate is an illusion. The few reliable blood tests are not affordable. Other tests produce too many false positives. Screening based on temperature scans is even less valid. Accurate testing and contact tracing are not scalable yet.

We must take our collective heads out of the sand! Schools cannot be reopened safely until community rates are in the single digits or we have a vaccine."
2020-07-12 02:50:03,"As a teacher myself our school will say dont come in if you feel ill, but so many days I and many others have minor symptoms like a slightly runny nose, a little cough, a sore throat, or a sense of being under the weather. If we stayed home all those days we will be absent a lot."
2020-07-12 03:00:20,"Ideas:
1. Space: use gyms, to hold multiple same size as normal classes. Noise concern? Each class has their own headset and mic per student and teacher, only connected to their class. Maybe use cafeteria. 
2. Lunch- in classroom. Staff takes sandwich,fruit,drink cart from room to room
3. Space: use nearby empty office space and churches.
4. Need more faculty, assistant teachers, support staff : Furloughed college teachers and unemployed.
5. Class schedule: one course in morning, one in afternoon. Eg, on Monday, English in am, Study in pm, Tue - Math, Tech, Wed - History, elective, Thur - Science, elective, Fri - foreign language, elective. Reason- eliminate crowded movement between classes.
Cut electives, study if want to go with 4 days a week.
6.Space: Use freed up classrooms from gym/outside classes (office building, churches). Current classes now split between 2-3 additional freed up rooms.
Teacher teaches 1/2 students say for 2 hrs, goes to next room to teach rest of his class. First room now has assistant teacher/sub supervising. During first 2 hrs, assistant teacher/sub supervising other half of class. Purpose: spread out students,6 ft apart.
7.Funding: emergency from state, fed.
8.Crazy idea: high school classes in evening, using high school building and empty middle school, elementary buildings.  Middle school, elementary-normal daytime, use empty high school. Rational: high school kids less likely to need parents during day while at home, so parents can work."
2020-07-12 03:02:31,"There are a number of intuitive, although yet to be studied / verified, factors that make sense as to children being less susceptible and less likely to spread the virus.  Old enough to have strong lungs and immune system response, but young enough to have few other debilitating conditions like obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc.  Smaller bodies, thus (maybe?) smaller absolute number of virus particles expelled?  Lots of studies now have pointed to time duration and concentration of aerosols etc from infected persons affecting others catching it from them.  Finally, most kids have been away from confined groups of other kids (no school, no daycare) for months now, so maybe way less chance during that time to catch it if the local “wave” of infection has passed them.  Will that change going into school classrooms?  Maybe or not - not in communities where cases are still rising, but maybe where stable it can work - IF adults will help and encourage their kids make the best of it to be able to rejoin their friends, instead of repeating over and over how it won’t till the kids don’t believe so either.  Adults, lead the way."
2020-07-12 03:21:17,"There is no perfect, risk free solution,  but keeping schools closed will have terrible socio-economic and health consequences. We need to respect the seriousness of CV-19, while making policy decisions that are risk and age stratified.  We know who is vulnerable to serious illness or death from covid. It is not children or otherwise healthy teachers. In Massachusetts, the survival rate for those under 60 is better than 99.95%. Of the reported covid deaths,  60% were over 80 years old, none were under 20. 65% of the fatalities were nursing home residents. There are very few teachers or staff in the 65-90 age bracket interacting with students. The vulnerable population should be isolated and accommodated  to minimize their risk.  Schoolchildren are not at risk of dying from covid, and otherwise healthy people under 55 are at practically no risk of dying from it either. I mean “not at risk” the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn’t paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable safety precautions for both. We cannot continue online learning and await a vaccine or curative treatment which may never come. Even if Trump (hopefully) is defeated, the virus will be around for many months or years, and we as a society need to manage risk and live with the virus while schools and other essential parts of society function."
2020-07-12 03:50:04,"Why is no one talking about the negative psychological effects of re-opening school buildings, only to have to shut them down again?  Isn't it more harmful for children go to their physical school for a month or two, then switch to remote learning, then go back to the physical school, and switch to remote learning?  Children need consistency, but no one is talking about this.  Wouldn't a consistent semester of remote learning be LESS harmful than a continuously disrupted school experience?"
2020-07-12 04:03:57,They should wait and open the schools in January after the holidays. This virus isn't done with us yet. We didn't get off on a great start to begin with. We need more time. Another 6 months may be the smartest thing we can do for the kids and teachers.
2020-07-12 04:29:27,"Education needs to move online.  The US has not acted responsibly and we are now paying the price. In other parts of the world schools have been re-opened only once a community has demonstrated a decline in cases and even then,  they have moved with extreme caution.  

The reality is that we do not have COVID under control and therefore the only safe solution in many states is to make classes available online.  Focus on core subjects only, with electives being made voluntary.  If companies can function online, so can schools.  

And yes, it will require parents to ensure that their kids are actually doing the work."
2020-07-12 04:59:18,"Each state should meet specified levels of transmission and positive testing rates before reopening schools. That is just common sense.  Contact tracing programs should also be instituted based on number of cases, which many states have inexplicably not bothered with.

Offer hybrid systems whenever possible so families can decide individually to send in the kids or use on-line learning.  We should also give teachers the ability to teach remotely, with kids in school or home, and the teachers and lessons shown on monitors.  We cannot risk losing our teachers to this virus - that would be a disaster we must avoid at all cost."
2020-07-12 05:43:07,another good example to look at is Austria! they also only gradually brought students back once the virus was more under control. but the key difference between Austria and many of the other countries listed is that they have a social saftey net watch which is absent in the entire US.
2020-07-12 05:45:15,"Sending kids back to school is a tragedy waiting to happen. The assumption is all schools have the resources to do it safely, which in a country of glaring inequality, they do not. For every well funded school that has the money for cleaning, disinfecting, proper PPE, classrooms in a well ventilated building with space for social distancing there is one in a poor community that has none of those things. Do we really want to see communities of color receive another blow when children start getting sick and bringing the virus home to their families?  There is no solid evidence it is safe to send kids back to school when there is widespread community transmission - the counties that have sent students back have their outbreaks under control, more widespread testing and universal healthcare. That’s not our reality. We are nowhere near ready or competent enough and we should not be putting the health and safety of students, teachers and staff at risk."
2020-07-12 05:51:16,I will not support keeping High Schools closed while allowing younger kids to return. It’s unfair and causes other problems even with 15-18 year olds.
2020-07-12 06:11:24,"I am a high school teacher in Western Australia where our schools, both public and private have never shut down nor seriously practiced social distancing [an impossibility in a school setting]. My average day in my school is currently no different than it was this time last year. So far there have been zero school transmissions in a state of 2 million people. Yes, I understand that our state has had the good fortune of largely avoiding widespread community infection but anecdotally it would it seem that schools are not greatly affected by the virus and opening them is worth the risk as the alternative of keeping them closed will produce other far greater harms."
2020-07-12 06:33:40,"Here in Finland, the kindergaten have been open during the epidemic. We opened schools two weeks before summer holiday in contrary to teachers tough resistance. Nothing bad happened. We see now max. 20 new cases per day, so the situation is in great control. The best method to prevent the pandemic spread for us so far has been to strictly prohibit travelling from countries (even inside EU) that have daily more than 8 cases per 100 000 people. I'm afraid all other means to suppress the virus are useless if you don't isolate disease centers. To limit movements is the smallest sacrifice."
2020-07-12 06:51:28,"Children almost never get sick from the virus, and don't generally give it to adults around them.  So there is little reason not to reopen schools."
2020-07-12 06:58:00,"Teacher in Stockholm, the hardest hit part of Sweden. We never closed schools for kids below 16 years, and there hasn’t been any particular surge in teacher illnesses. It is not really possible to distance in school either.

It has been weird, but my job days were pretty much the same this spring as they usually are. I can’t say why, just that it seems to have worked to stay open."
2020-07-12 08:10:04,"Sad to say, but Always Larry is correct on all points, given our horrible response to the issue of safely getting kids back to school. This article mentions one sentence about smaller kids having more difficulty in following distancing guidelines than older kids. There is also no mention of these European countries now having reports of % of positive cases way below 1% now, and in many states here it's currently between 10 and 30%!
Any parent who pays attention can tell you that kids of all ages simply won't follow distancing guidelines and constant mask wearing for very long, unless physically restrained beyond levels that could be practically implemented at present in our schools.  younger kids don't comprehend the danger or have the impulse control, older kids have the same problems at different developmental levels. 
We're now placing much more emphasis on costs of losing a year of classroom learning over risking the  health  and in many cases the lives of everyone involved."
2020-07-12 08:20:05,"I understand that school may be the best place for some kids but that the danger to them and all teachers, support staff, and extended family at home may not be worth it. Instead of ""what if, what if"", why doesn't each school district take a serious survey of its students whose families are willing/need to have them return to the classroom. Hopefully, almost half will still opt for online classes and at least the school systems will know how to plan for at least the first half of the year while, hopefully, this country gets its act together as far as this virus goes.
No amount of ignoring it, or spinning it to political advantage, is going to change the facts on the ground.  Wake up, people, stop wringing your hands - find, and let, someone lead this initiative who has the best interests of all at heart and is not just politically motivated. There is a solution to be found, we just need to get the political hubris out of the way."
2020-07-12 08:31:05,"Within days of opening most of these schools will be shutting their doors and transitioning back to digital learning.  How will this reopening vary from that of the current? 

Who will build statues to the scores of dead children and teachers forced into this impending nightmare? Not to mention the tens of thousands who will become sick with their families and friends. As a teacher I am still holding out hope that people will wake up and really consider the big picture of what is about to happen across the country. 

Let's stay digital at least until the November election. 
Perhaps by spring they can forgive themselves."
2020-07-12 08:47:01,"This is a thought provoking and interesting article on one of the most divisive aspects of the COVID era. Unfortunately due to the incredibly different healthcare and educational  systems and government approaches to COVID and their consequences, I don’t think you can extrapolate the experience of Denmark or Ireland to the US. I am an American trained American doctor working in the Irish healthcare system and enjoy being a public servant. What I don’t enjoy is the constant refrain I see from teachers who say “doctors and nurses signed up for this, we did not.”  Doctors and nurses (or healthcare assistants, hospital cleaners etc) are not martyrs. We have families and children too, and want the best possible opportunities for their health and educational future, and none of us went into healthcare to orphan them."
2020-07-12 09:08:39,"""How to Reopen Schools: What Science and Other Countries Teach Us"" - Science? It is a foreign word for Trump and trumpists that they do not comprehend. And, we are so darn ""exceptional"" that we cannot learn anything from other countries. The solution to open our schools safely and responsively is very clear from both of the above. We need MUCH more extensive testing and we need contact tracing which is pretty straightforward in a school environment. However, Trump, the ""stable genius"", is against both of these obvious measures. Opening the schools on Trump's whim without these measures will lead to thousands of unnecessary American deaths and Trump should be held personally responsible."
2020-07-12 09:13:06,"In the UK we have gradually reopened primary schools but are being more cautious with secondary (high) schools due to the way teenagers are taught. In primary school, children stay in one class with the same teacher all day. This is easier to manage by way of bubbles. Older children at secondaries change subject every hour, thereby changing building, changing teacher and accessing different, shared resources. This constant movement around the school makes it more challenging to maintain social distancing, cleanliness and to isolate a bubble we’re they to be an outbreak. How does this compare to American Hugh schools?"
2020-07-12 09:27:57,"No one seems to be asking about the short and long-term effects of exposure to all of the disinfectants being sprayed around. What is in the disinfectants - given the hazmat suits being worn by the people doing the spraying, it must be pretty toxic. In poorly ventilated rooms being sprayed repeatedly, how much of it are children and staff inhaling, or consuming inadvertently?"
2020-07-12 09:51:08,"I've been reading about summer camps having to close because of widespread outbreaks, so how does that fit into all of this. Camps are generally more in the out of doors than are schools, but children and staff are being infected. 

That said, if schools can open because kids don't generally get particularly sick and are poor transmitters, does it make sense to quarantine a whole class if one kid tests positive? I would think that especially for younger kids that kind of disruption, which might happen repeatedly in a school year, would be pretty destructive emotionally and academically."
2020-07-12 10:00:44,"We have leaders who are private school advocates wanting public schools open so the economy can recover. They are not interested in the health or well being of public school children.

We not only have a high infection rate, but we have forty percent of the country thinking that covid-19 is a democratic hoax that any acknowledgement of is  just an attempt to embarrass the President.

Haven’t you seen the people throwing a fit because they have been asked to wear a mask on the private property of grocery stores? Wouldn’t you believe these people would pass their views to their children? They would definitely think that they have total latitude on public property. There would be low compliance with mask wearing especially when it is pointed out it is for the protection of others not the mask wearer. 

We have also seen without schools being opened that people have attempted to weaponize the virus by intentionally coughing on people when they get upset. Not to mention the assaults happening when people are asked to follow  rules or guidelines. Again, these people will send their kids to school with the same attitude. 

If schools are opened in the fall, be prepared for the acrimony and daily grievances that will occur. The United States is a country like no other and we will see American exceptionalism on full display."
2020-07-12 10:06:30,"First of all gym classes  can be held outside until November . Parks  can also be used for exercise. 
Entire classes can run around the school block 
Stretching   Push-ups, sit ups , and nutrition can be taught online. All science and math classes can be taught online easily. I suggested this years ago. Why aren’t films made by the best teachers for  all 30 classes taught in junior high school and 30 classes taught  in high school and at any time a student can simply watch and learn . All summer long students could study on their own time. Stop restricting education by not simply videotaping instruction. Algebra   Geometry , trigonometry, ore on calculus or ore calculus . An be videotaped. Surprise junior high school students will learn these four years before they enter high school at their own pace of it was simply put online the same  is true for high school students. ."
2020-07-12 10:07:33,"What’s going to happen is that parents will have to come up w their own plans and it’s likely going to widen the gulf between economic groups. For example, parents in one of our well off neighborhoods are thinking of hiring teachers to come teach small groups of kids similar to the homeschool model. A teacher friend of ours is considering that should schools not open here. Virtual school has been tough. She said out 30 of her kids she’s heard from 15, the rest only once or not at all. 
My kids are still very young, but I joked w her that I should get on her waiting list for when they’re older. 
Joking aside what do the folks who can’t hire their own teacher do for their kids?"
2020-07-12 10:30:30,"The one dilemma of opening schools is the fact that children attending K-12 are ideal Petri dishes for COVID-19.  When this age group is infected, generally they may get a case of the sniffles or symptoms no worse than a bad cold.  This makes them ideal spreaders COVID-19.

Then there is always the general mindset of children that age, if all can remember back then, of rebellion and ignoring adults.  How many will take mask wearing seriously?  How many will really listen to things like social distancing?  Then there is the backlash of ""no mask"" parents if their children are disciplined for not wearing masks."
2020-07-12 10:32:49,"Look to Asia for some guidance. Yes, the Asian culture us more compliant than the US and they are far more community oriented. But they have open schools with social distancing and other safety measures. School is important for the proper socialization and education of future generations at each age-specific level. Missing a year will lead to a generation of slowed development. Not catastrophic, but not healthy either."
2020-07-12 10:35:37,"Why do children need to be sent back to school? Because parents  and educators have to go back to work. Why do they have to go back to work? Because we—in the richest nation on earth, with skyrocketing police and military budgets and abundant wealth funneled to the one percent— have decided we won't pay them enough to stay home and stay safe until the virus is under control. We have decided to prioritize keeping the economy running (to enrich the very few) over life itself. If this doesn't call for a revolution and a thorough rethinking of our priorities and fundamental principles, what does?"
2020-07-12 10:37:16,"Let's not forget that the countries that have opened schools successfully also have universal health care and a social net. So if kids get sick they get care and their parents get time to take care of them or care themselves if they get sick. Will parents also have to factor in health care and ""out of pocket"" expenses plus pay cuts (or being fired) into their going back to school decisions?"
2020-07-12 10:38:45,"The lack of a coordinated, data-driven effort by the Trump administration to thoroughly assess the safety of returning kids to school, from pre-kindergarten through college, is stunning.

School districts and universities are not equipped to fund nor carry through such an analysis.

Why has Trump passed the buck on this vital duty of the federal government?"
2020-07-12 10:39:47,"It's wishful thinking, not Science, to look at a few results in a nice little country school in Denmark -- a country which successfully controlled the virus, and has universal healthcare and parental leave -- and make conclusions that will affect millions of people's lives.  The situation in the US is completely different, with our crowded urban schools with aging ventilation systems, rural schools with long bus rides, lack of universal healthcare, and a population encouraged by its president to flout the rules and ignore the risks, all in an uncontrolled and still surging pandemic. ""Data from around the world"" does not tell us how to open US schools safely."
2020-07-12 10:40:05,"Anyone citing low fatality rates without accounting for the lung, heart, and brain damage being found in people of all ages who ""recover"" from ""asymptomatic"" cases is playing an important propaganda role to shield and deflect from folks who have minimized this public health issue from the start.

It seems we have become the world power we always wanted to be -- just not in the way we might have hoped or intended. Come to find out we are as good or better at bamboozling our own people as any authoritarian government, after all. 

Curiously, other countries seem largely immune to what works on Americans.

Somehow, in the rush to re-open and in our present inward focus, the travel bans recently imposed on us haven't caught more attention. Apparently, just one more symptom of the low-information pandemic.

This article is filled with information that families, communities, and leaders can use to prepare mentally for what happens next. Community spread is a critical, if not the most important, factor to study. 

Hope this knowledge can spread faster than the virus, but the first four months suggest otherwise."

Temperature checks and testing needs to be widely available. Masks worn indoors always. PPE provided to teacher upon request. If weather permits, teach in designated spaces outdoors.

We can’t open schools on the cheap and we can’t open them like there is no virus. 

P.s. :Has Kawasaki syndrome only been identified in New York?"
2020-07-12 10:46:15,"Honestly Given the circumstances I'm already immensely gratefull and relieved that my husband's NYC college, after weeks of announcing that fall would be business as usual, let teachers choose wether to teach in person or not."
2020-07-12 10:46:31,"The social aspect of schooling is the primary benefit of collective synchronized education, otherwise custom student centered education works (home schooling, private schools), think Sir Ken Robinson. Many schools put kids in front of computers and feed them stored customized content for part of the day.
Of course, schools also serve the purpose of state sponsored daycare, so employers can keep the shareholders happy.  As always, it is risk/reward...the trick is to have the people who take the risk get the reward."

I was never so happy as when I could safely remove my mask in my car.
I really doubt small children (and even rebellious teens could wear a mask all day.  
It is difficult to talk through a mask (or should I say be heard through a mask.)
I have 8 cloth masks.  Only 2 of them are tight.  The others have air pockets and sometimes fall off.
Distancing?  With young children and adolescents?  For 6 hours?  Forget it.    Look at the picture.  So much for social distancing.  
The United States IS NOT Denmark or Norway.  They successfully contained the virus by community effort.  Look at all the people in the United States that refuse to wear masks and practice social distancing.  
And 10 students in a classroom?  Thirty students are in a classroom where I live.  That means each school would need 3 times the classrooms they currently have.  And 3 times the teachers."

I have seen people out in the malls as if there is no pandemic. All of this ""economic"" activity will have us back where we started just in time for back to school. We need to crush viral spread as much as possible in order to go back safely. But as usual the almighty dollar is more important than human life, so it's off to the malls we go."
2020-07-12 10:55:09,"One problem lies in cramming lots of children into small areas, taught by people who commute.  Why not try to something like the one-room schoolhouse of the past, where kids in a neighbourhood are taught by someone in that neighbourhood?  

My guess is that every block in every small town has someone who would be happy and reasonably qualified to do this.  In a city, every apartment building likely has several people who could help.

No, this would not be the same as the big school, with a gymnasium and a pretty library down the hall from well-equipped classrooms and teachers who are keeping abreast of the latest theories of teaching. But it would be some form of education (a form that worked well for generations in rural areas), it would allow parents to work, and it would put up firewalls against virus spread.  Oh, and it would be wonderful for this new group of community-based teachers, who will realize what  a joy it can be, to teach, to inspire, and just to look after, the children of your neighbours."
2020-07-12 11:00:19,"I’ve open our schools when a state has a reduced replication rate, after we have a stable and low number of new cases per day. Otherwise the question isn’t when to open schools but what to do with infected children and teachers."
2020-07-12 11:11:50,"Another point omitted in this article is that teachers generally do not need to come closer than 6 feet to students, except in early childhood. Considering that children in general are not at great risk from the virus, it would seem logical to focus on keeping teachers socially distant from students, and not waste effort on impossible and likely useless goals such as preventing student to student contact in play, and sanitizing surfaces, despite much evidence that this is not the way the virus is being transmitted."
2020-07-12 11:13:44,"It's inevitable that with such high numbers of students co-mingling, the number of Covid cases will increase dramatically.  as is the case with young party goers.  Schools are the bars for children."
2020-07-12 11:17:10,"I can speak to transmission amongst teenagers from experience. I’m a high school teacher at a public school one block from Union Square in NYC, which in many ways is considered the center of the city as the Union Square subway station is a nexus of most of the subway lines that run across the five boroughs. I started to experience  COVID-19 two days after the last day that students and staff held in-person school back in March. However, unless weather is really bad, I bike to school every day - so I hadn’t ridden the subway in well over two weeks. That first week that NYC schools were shut down, I was tested and got a positive result while my wife’s test came back negative - and she had been working from home for over a week at that point anyway. So the only vectors that made sense for where I might have contracted it are school or the grocery store.  But in the two weeks leading up to when I contracted symptoms, I spent 8 -10 hours at day at my school building while spending at most 1 hour total I’m the grocery store. I know of two of my students were sick with something in that week leading up to the shutdown. Given my experience, I’m fairly confident high school students can transmit the disease."
2020-07-12 11:23:19,"The basic argument in this article is ""Keeping schools closed for a prolonged stretch has worrisome implications for social and academic development, child development experts say. It also became evident this spring that denying children a real school day deepened racial and economic inequalities.

“There is really damage to kids if they don’t go to school,” Dr. Edwards said. “I think we have got to think of the kids and getting them back to school safely.”

Please share the  evidence that not going to school "" deepened racial and economic inequalities"". Also, the authors assume that all school experiences are the same. They are not. Haven't we been repeatedly reminded that there are effective and ineffective schools? 
Economic status, expectations, the parent's educational level, parental involvement, and the effective school instructional, and a safe learning environment are just some important factors leading to a child's school success. 
Some might point out that  children must attend school first and then these factors can be considered. Perhaps, one can also assume that schools can have a deleterious effect on children as well. 
BTW--  So , what happens when some children get ill from the virus? Well , we can just tell the parent's that we read an article in the NYT which essentally argued for their return. That should provide the parent's with a great deal of comfort."
2020-07-12 11:31:56,"For what it’s worth, here in Melbourne Australia we opened schools a month ago after getting the virus under control. We’re now right in the middle of a second wave in the middle of winter with daily case rates higher than they have been since April. Don’t do it!"
2020-07-12 11:32:20,"Why aren't you doing research without being so Eurocentric? Show how countries in Asia (Malaysia, Taiwan), Uruguay in South America, or New Zealand are dealing with schools reopening successfully, while also having much lower tr rates compared to EU. There is no possible way we can reopen schools in urban centers or places where tr rates (virus reproduction rate or spread of transmission) are so high. All these countries have one thing in common besides low Covid infections, kids and adults alike wear masks. We could only dream to reach their low levels of infection. They also have governments that enacted national plans, universal healthcare, and scientific based approach to the pandemic (interdisciplinary teams), something we lacked from the start."
2020-07-12 11:35:42,"BTW --   from the NYT on July 7,2020

""An overnight summer camp in rural southwestern Missouri has seen scores of campers, counselors and staff infected with the coronavirus, the local health department revealed this week, raising questions about the ability to keep kids safe at what is a rite of childhood for many.

Missouri is one of several states to report outbreaks at summer camps. The Kanakuk camp near Branson ended up sending its teenage campers home. On Friday, the local health department announced 49 positive cases of the COVID-19 virus at the camp. By Monday, the number had jumped to 82."""
2020-07-12 11:39:55,"It's possible to re-open schools in the fall, not completely safely, but with a lower level of risk. You need a lot of testing: everyone on admission and then those showing symptoms or who have been exposed Unfortunately we don't have that many tests available. From when this virus first appeared President Trump has taken tests to limit testing.  Kids have to mask at school and on the bus - so the schools are going to have to buy a lot of masks. In late APRIL, months after Covid-19 arrived in our country, my wife and I donated two N-95 masks we had to the local hospital. The Emergency Department nurses who got them, one of whom was assisting in surgery that afternoon, thanked us. They had had to wear cheap paper masks or homemade bandannas, not even changing between patients. And you have to have as much social distancing as possible. That means much smaller class sizes - not averaging over thirty kids like in some Republican states, but a maximum of ten to fifteen. You have to more than double the number of teachers, and hire some people to monitor the halls, cafeterias and playgrounds. You have to add temporary classrooms. When I was in high school double wide trailers were leased. This will cost trillions. But Trump, DeVos, and most Republicans in Congress want to reduce money spent on public schools. To them, the safety of children (and the people the children come in contact with) isn't worth paying for."
2020-07-12 11:40:03,"The rush to return children to school is in part the reasons cited by Pediatric Assoc. 

What really drivers this train wreck of a decision is the pool of employees needed to reopen businesses. These empty buildings cost money which continue to create red ink. This is  preventing companies from servicing their debt leading to defaults that reverberates through the financial system. Those who are Parents can't return to work leaving their children unattended and the below par average income of this much needed work force can't afford childcare. 

Reopening schools as the spread of Covid-19  has yet to be tamed is playing the game of Russian Roulette with all lives. We continue to make decisions with a multitude of unanswered questions and/or the validation of what we belive we already know. As this frightening journey continues the nuances of this virus are beginning to surface. 

The action plan to safely open classrooms is sound on paper but I fear the continuity will not be successful.  Additionally, it is impossible to monitor the behavior of a students family. 

This deadly pandemic we are living is in it's infancy. This rush to reopen our schools is a dangerous experiment placing our youth, all those that interact with them and the lives of our most important commodity, our educators in harm's way.  My 3 children are grown and my hearts stops for all those who have no choice."
2020-07-12 11:43:41,"Here we go again - ""virus raging in America!'.  Raging where?  Absolutely everywhere?  In many parts of the country it's at levels comparable with those in the European countries quoted in the article.  The decision to reopen schools must be done district-by-district, with those districts where the virus is at the level of, say, Stockholm, being allowed to reopen fully and without restrictions.  

The lesson from the lockdown that was unneccessary imposed everywhere  and caused both so much unnecessary suffing and a backlash should have been to quit painting the entire huge country with a broad brush."
2020-07-12 11:43:51,"We can do this only with a huge influx of cash and the hiring of more staff, replacement of air circulation systems, higher pay and life insurance plans for teachers, smaller class sizes and testing on site. We live in the US so in most states this won’t happen, but this is the only way to open schools."
2020-07-12 11:44:23,"In the picture where nursing students showed first graders at Ethel Phillips Elementary School in Sacramento how to properly wash their hands, what happened to social distancing? The kids are sitting right next to one another!

This is what is wrong with reopening schools. It will spread the virus from child to child, and child to teacher, giving the virus a chance to spread like crazy. 

Until a vaccine is ready, have the children learn at home. Give parents an infusion of cash to have one of them stay home with their child, or to hire someone to be with the children during the day. 

Keep libraries closed as well. The virus can live on books for at least 3 days. Libraries will spread the virus if they are reopened."
2020-07-12 11:44:28,"After the disasters in Florida, Arizona, Texas and other southern states,  does one really believe that school openings will be managed any better than the re-openings by the governors of these states?

Virtual education is better than no education but brick and mortar classroom education in these times will mean more deaths. Deaths of children, of the teachers and other support staff."
2020-07-12 11:49:30,"There will not be a consensus on this and localities (at state, city, county level) will reach different conclusions based on medical (transmission rates), economic considerations of parents and communities, political pressure from both sides etc. Individual parents will have their own priorities and teachers as well. Like so many other issues with Covid it seems more is unknown than known. It looks generations to fully understand and treat tuberculosis and the development of a vaccine for polio was decades in coming. There is no vaccine for HIV and not for lack of trying but life did and will go on."
2020-07-12 11:52:22,"I’ve done the cost benefit analysis. 

I understand life has risks and you cannot mitigate them all. 

I have understood that if I want to send my kid to school, especially given where I live, I will have to accept and work on the assumption that some of the kids’ parents still believe believe it’s a hoax. 
They will not wear masks or socially distance outside of school and they won’t think twice before sending their kids to school with the sniffles. 

I would’ve maybe been willing to risk it, for my child’s mental health.

But ONLY if I knew for certain that when the inevitable outbreak happens, I or a teacher or a member of staff or a child or ANYONE who is feeling sick can get get a rapid test and result with no problem.

When I no longer have to worry about getting a hospital bed, a ventilator, or just basic medical supplies that no first world nation should be running out of yet again nearly six months into a pandemic. 

A massive infusion of cash into education and healthcare 3-4 months ago and we could’ve been on our way to a partial reopening. Money, going to the right places, that’s all it would’ve taken. 

The opening schools experiment will fail within a month of opening, with yet more unnecessary misery and death. You can’t go on foolishly living first-world lives in a third-world nation. 
Brace yourselves, America. There’s a terrible moon rising."
2020-07-12 11:55:40,"The decision to open  schools should be related to the community of such schools  I teach in a diverse, low income school..Our students need to be in school.  However, The concern is how to do this safely.  I am surprised at the lack of creative thought being reflected in some of the plans i am seeing. It seems like it is either stay home or come back full time with little social distancing and masks are optional.  why not change the schedule so kids are in smaller groups and meet for shorter periods?  how about older kids go to school fewer days and in staggered groups?  Given our current rise in cases and the increase in cases for 20-40s, it seems to me that we need to put in some more thought before mandating a return.  one size fits all is not going to work!"
2020-07-12 11:57:47,"It is irresponsible to compare the US to countries with citizens who understand basic principles of science, comply with national mandates (i.e.,wearing masks), have routine testing, access to universal healthcare, paid parental leave, etc. In 27 yrs of working in schools, I have yet to see classrooms or buildings being cleaned well. Basic things like door knobs are never wiped or disinfected. Supplies like soap, tissues, and wipes are in short supply and teachers often spend their own money to supplement and/or ask families to donate materials. What teachers are being asked to do in the face of re-opening schools in the fall is ridiculous. The attention to social distancing, not sharing class materials and maintaining a clean classroom environment, is going to make the task of teaching even harder. Will anyone be checking every staff and student's temperature at the door each morning? How will proper ventilation be addressed? Windows can stay open now - if they aren't locked shut - but what about the winter? If we are so desperate to send kids and school staff back, why are we at least not considering the better model of the 4 days on/10 days off plan? Half days or kids coming in every other day will do nothing to keep transmission rates down if there are outbreaks because you will still have the entire school population infected. In addition to lacking a national CV19 plan, we desperately need a national science curriculum. You can't put the economy over public health."
2020-07-12 11:58:13,"It all comes down to leadership. And unfortunately, in the USA, we have none.  No matter what plan is devised it will be ridiculed by those who think they know better. How can you plan to send children back to school under very tight safety policies when 40% of the adults out there, following the lead of their President feel it is a waste of time and will resist and misinform. What some of the other countries have going for it, as it appears, is that most people are on the same page, are supporting the plan and have leaders who don't politicize  the issue."
2020-07-12 11:59:13,One cannot know if social distancing was more effective than closing schools since the schools have not yet reopened.  It is an fraught assumption.
2020-07-12 12:02:30,"Per the UW report linked in the article, the following countries are not requiring that students wear face masks in schools: Denmark, Germany (if tested negative), New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Most of the Asian countries in the list, however, are requiring face masks. Apparently, wearing masks in schools to reduce viral spread is a cultural, rather than empirically-supported practice. The problem with our plans for re-opening schools is that we have made wearing masks the linchpin, it is not. I support mask requirements as a symbol of acknowledgement that the virus is real, highly communicable, and deadly. But I'm not going within 20 feet of a known covid-positive person, regardless of whether we're both wearing hand-sewn masks. This is what we'll be asking teachers do this fall?! There is scant evidence that wearing a cloth mask without eye protection prevents transmission in situations of prolonged indoor exposure. Look at the constant outbreaks in nursing homes from staff-resident transmission. Yet some bizarre consensus has emerged around the unfounded belief that if we only wore masks we could re-open things while containing the virus. A national mask mandate and widespread testing regime back in March would have been sound policy, now it's magical thinking. It's simply too late. Re-opening public K-12 schools and universities in this country is an exercise in herd immunity by Russian roulette."
2020-07-12 12:02:59,"We need to get creative and treat this like the emergency it is. 

If this was a tornado, we'd be reusing spaces like churches, warehouses, libraries, offices, etc as spaces to house homeless, wounded, and supplies. (Or look at WWII as example of the country coming together to supply the troops.)

Why not work with institutions like that to create separate pods of small classroom size? Keep teachers virtual, beam them to the smaller classes, and employ the unemployed(with considerable backround check) to be class assistants/chaperones to help keep kids on task and ensure cdc guidelines are followed. 

If some families can keep kids home, they can follow along virtually. 

Use emergency federal or state funds to cover the cost. Many of these places are/should be closed currently in places that are dealing with high numbers."
2020-07-12 12:04:17,"Considering the extensive safety measures needed and the risks associated with reopening the schools, will parents be willing to send their children, will children and teachers be willing to attend? There will surely be infections reported in schools and they will be widely reported - how will this affect the experiment? Children will be fearful, perhaps traumatized, they will refuse to go.  Those who are motivated by the economic benefits of reopening, and there are many in that category, including the Trump administration, will push for this, they will be distrusted by those who are asked to take the risk of sending their children back into the public school system.

This  will not work until the virus is defeated. With no vaccine  the virus will be defeated only with another total rigidly- enforced lock down."
2020-07-12 12:04:30,"This is a good article bringing together the available scientific evidence about the effects of reopening schools on transmission. 

It would have been very useful to include the pre-requisites for reopening schools as used by some of the countries mentioned in this article. For example: 
1) a signficantly low and decreasing 14-day incident rate (e.g. < 50 positives / 100,000 people)
2) a swift and robust local monitoring & intervention infrastructure (testing, tracing, isolation practices...)
3) hygiene plan to minimize transmission (distance, ventilation, masking (if necessary), cleaning, groups, ...)
4) physical infrastructure to implement specified hygiene plan
...
And the ask which states actually could fulfill these requirements. How much funding is required to make it happen?"
2020-07-12 12:06:04,"I have been watching a sort of floor show out in the parking lot of the medical building where I work. A doctor will come out, in full PPE, and do a young child's exam from the car. In one case, they popped open the trunk, placed the sick infant in there and did the exam from the trunk.  

Parents and children are waiting in cars to go in for well exams. 

So I have to ask, if this is the way pediatrician's offices are managing, how on earth can the AAP recommend schools open? They are not allowing 15 or more kids in their waiting rooms, for even a few minutes, let alone hours. And they are suited up as if on a moon mission.

Education is important; it is critical. I am the child of a university professor and an English teacher. I grew up in a town in which education was the driver or our community.

But if we are still wearing PPE when a child sprouts a fever, we have not figured out safe management of larger groups of children."
2020-07-12 12:10:48,"A major problem with reopening schools, which this article does not address, is funding.  Many school districts lack the financial resources to purchase sufficient sanitizers and PPE.  The HVAC systems in many school districts are antiquated and lack sufficient filtration.    Add to this the problem of keeping school buses clean.    Meanwhile,  the primary source of funding, at least in Connecticut where I live, is property taxes,  which is not a flexible source of revenue.  Without centralized well planned funding assistance,  reopening schools safely will be an impossibility."
2020-07-12 12:16:35,Children bring diseases home from school. Reopening schools is not a way to control  the spread of the virus. It will cost the lives of some parents and grandparents. It is not a good idea.
2020-07-12 12:17:43,"America, make the investment. Select 5-10 schools in areas with the very lowest per capita infection at present rates, open smartly with masks distances, soap everywhere and then test kids weekly and follow communities very closely. Test parents and teachers weekly as well. If this works, try the second to best per capita spots and do the same, repeat and advance only if no bump in cases. But either you test 1000-10,000 times more frequently than now or you open and our world crashes down again. In essence, our only way out of this is testing like it’s never been built before."
2020-07-12 12:18:31,"Most other countries have universal Health Care of some type, non-sociopathic leaders that actually care about the citizens, stable and consistent availability of PPE, educated specialists who are allowed to make decisions of import. The old USA was in very bad shape before this disaster, now the old USA is burned toast. It's not coming back, and we are going to see chaos and pain continue in education and everywhere else until trump and company are removed. If they ever are."
2020-07-12 12:22:19,"This article follows and attempts to support the editorial board’s recent insistence schools must open. 

But in reality we’re woefully unprepared to do so. We should be asking ourselves what problems do six to eight months of delay really present? (Plenty of time to have vaccines and treatments, or not).

But we already know the bulk of transmissions happen in households. Sending kids into ill prepared schools is almost guaranteeing perpetual infections and is essentially the opposite of any recommended prescription of social distancing. 

For six months of school we could recapture in two summers?"
2020-07-12 12:24:09,"The answer to bringing back students is the same as the answer to bring back the economy: you have to attack the pandemic FIRST. If the spread of the virus increases, both schools and the economy will suffer. Period. Full stop. Sure, you can try to rationalize away how we can possibly do both using faulty logic but the virus doesn’t care about your opinions. It doesn’t care if you think it is a hoax, or created by ANTIFA or QANON or the deep state. 

The question now is: has the USA gone beyond the point so that now recovery is going to be really painful in lost lives, lost income, and very expensive solutions to repair what we destroyed? Were   politicians really the best minds to make these decisions especially those politicians that Evidence says no, but there also seems to be a large part of our society that shares their perspective. Snowflakes who refuse to wear masks for whatever reason. We needed educated adults to guide us in the means to reduce and deflect, what we got was COVIDiots.

While the need to bring back students is greatest because parents want to do something else, the rationalization is that children are less susceptible to the virus, they need human interaction for mental health, etc. What happens when all of the teachers get sick and there is no backup? We will be back to square one. 

So the way to get around this is to focus on reducing the viral spread. All energies should be on doing this now."
2020-07-12 12:24:11,"Having half the number of students come at one time is unlikely to allow for any kind of social distancing. Kids are much less than three feet apart in a normal school day. 

Will they line up 6 ft apart and get temperature checks? Who will do the temperature checks? How long will it take for 1,000 students to enter a building like this? 

What about cafeterias? Most serve lunch from 10-2 because of difficult schedules already, and the kids sit with elbows bumping anyway. So, cutting the number of students in half might allow them to sit 3 feet apart, talking and eating in a badly ventilated cafeteria. 

Has any school in America figured out how to do this? I call on Betsy Devos to show us one typical American elementary, middle, and high school that has a functional plan to open according to CDC guidelines."
2020-07-12 12:30:38,"This is a time of great fear and sorrow, and will no doubt impact this generation of children, perhaps in ways we can't even yet foresee. But we shouldn't blame schools for this, or expect schools to be the panacea that will make life normal again. I think that might be the underlying agenda here: a totally unrealistic hope that if we can just open schools, the kids will be okay. But we're living through a pandemic. And we're not okay."
2020-07-12 12:31:18,"Considering the US track record to date, school reopening will be a disaster.

1) We have national anti-leadership and a Party that has become a death cult.
2) We have a significant fraction of the population that rejects science and doesn’t understand it.
3) Decades of demagoguery about public spending have made it politically near-impossible to invest in anything like the levels needed.
4) Right wing media has been spreading disinformation about the pandemic since day one, and continues to do so.

This one gets at the root problem of why America is doing so badly.

5) As long as the oligarchs responsible for so much of the above don’t feel personally threatened by the pandemic, they will continue to undermine efforts to deal effectively with the pandemic. Unless the economy crashes and stays crashed, unless the super-rich feel our pain, they will resist anything that threatens their grip on our government. 

The fact that the rich have been getting richer during all this is a stark indicator of how they have rigged everything to their benefit, no matter what."
2020-07-12 12:32:33,"If kids going to school is important to the economy, wouldn’t we see those “negative“ effects every summer? Or during any extended school break?"
2020-07-12 12:33:04,"It is time to face up to the facts  The US effort to fight the virus has been a monumental failure. No country in the world has been as ineffective as the US. There can be no return to anything close to normal until the virus is defeated.

It is easy to blame Trump, and certainly he deserves a big share of the blame, but so do many others, governors and other public officials, and  a large segment of the general population. It is the more disciplined societies that have succeeded, societies that trust and obey their governments, societies with a greater shared concern for their fellow citizens.

Is the US capable of winning this battle. Is there a leader who could unify the country to the degree necessary to win it?  Certainly  it is not Trump. Hillary could not have done it.  Is it Biden? Could Obama have done it?"
2020-07-12 12:33:23,"The notion that children under twelve do not readily spread viruses which is promulgated by the Association of American pediatrics in this article, sounds to this retired teacher like a group of physicians who never spent any time in a public school. Schools are petrie dishes of viruses as anyone who has taught knows. Every fall and winter I patiently awaited the bronchitis  that would eventually enter my lungs and hang on for a couple of weeks. And I was/am a very healthy individual. Working in a school loaded with children exposes anyone to an array of illnesses that pass rapid fire among the population. Adding a COVID to the mix is a serious and imminent danger to anyone in that environment. Dismissing the risk is foolhardy and irresponsible."
2020-07-12 12:34:23,"Teacher-centered instruction will be the model to follow, if schools reopen. Is that what we want? The student-centered activities will be limited because of wearing masks and social distance. How is a student in the back of the classroom going to hear well a teacher who is wearing a mask? How can a teacher work  with a student who is having difficulty understanding directions when the student is 6 feet apart? Will students be able to break in groups and practice a conversation in a French 2 class in high school when they are six feet apart and the rest of the class is doing the same speaking aloud because they are six feet apart? We should compile a list of possible school scenarios when the premises for a safe environment will fall apart."

2020-07-12 12:40:27,"As a teacher with 30 years in the ranks who adores her students, loves school more than anyone has a right to, and desperately wants to be back in my class, I have some say in this. As one who warned here in January that this would be a pandemic, that it would kill many and that the US would have the worst death and infection rate in the world (and I was told by fellow readers I was ""crazy,"" an ""alarmist,""  and a ""hysteric"") my critical thinking has been on target. As one, who has read obsessively about COVID and examined how other countries have dealt with it, I feel confident in saying this:

There is no safe way to open US schools. Period. 

All of the ideas being bandied about have great merit to them and should become the new normal. We DO need smaller classes, more fresh air, more teachers, better sanitary protocols. We also need a year, at minimum, to implement them and billions of dollars. Do journalists grasp that some schools open in a matter of weeks, not months? That many can't afford books much less PPE?

Lacking time and money, we must segue to enhancing and improving online learning. The countries that have the luxury of opening are the ones that took this pandemic seriously and did everything in their power to bend the curve. We didn't. We've put ourselves in a dire place.

 Are we really going to double down on that failure and send our children into harm's way? If so, I'm ready to bail on this country because that's not just benighted; it's indefensible."
2020-07-12 12:40:58,"I’m a physician and epidemiologist.  What is needed to get schools open for kids is more knowledge about exactly who is infected at an early stage or asymptomatically so they can be quickly isolated. Thus, what is needed is constant testing of every student and staff member in the schools twice weekly. 

An infected individual will begin to shed virus themselves after about 72 hours, thus testing everyone Mondays and Thursdays will catch most cases. But what about funding you say? Imagine if the US government asked private citizens to pay for building bombers in WW II; we’d all be speaking German today. Testing for COVID is the current equivalent. The federal government needs to simply pay, through deficit spending because it will be as expensive as a world war effort, for COVID testing of every person inside every school building in the country twice a week. Once we have this on-going monitoring system in place, we can safely design plans for kids to return to school. Without it we’re just guessing - and look how well that’s worked out here in the US so far!"
2020-07-12 12:48:12,"I am disappointed by the lack of science in this paragraph:

In Austin, for example, which like cities in Florida and Arizona has seen a recent acceleration in new cases, the estimated infection rate now is about seven per 1,000 residents. That means a school with 500 students would have about four carrying the coronavirus.

Actually, that rate the is the prevalence (how many infected since the start) not the incidence (currently infected). Not sure what the incidence of ""currently contagious"" is since no one is clear how long that phase of illness lasts - likely shorter for kids. Also the rate is very different by age group. I doubt the rate is 7/1000 in children - more likely 0.7. And when people are infected, at least some have symptoms, and they won't go to school - screening would keep them out and hopefully so would common sense and common decency. So - the school won't ""have 4 students"" to isolate. More likely 0.07 students which is just a little less than one student in one school out of 100 similar schools. And that student may or may not be able to transmit to adults especially with safety procedures in place. So for that student's teacher's sake, we will consider keeping 50,000 (500/school x 100) students home indefinitely? 

Math can be boring and corona is definitely scary, but it's important to be accurate about both."
2020-07-12 12:48:45,"Since school classrooms do not accommodate six foot distancing between students and school ventilation systems are not designed to protect students from corona virus why not erect large temporary structures (e.g., tents without sides and/or with roof fans) on school athletic fields)?"
2020-07-12 12:50:19,"This looks like a true generational battle between what is best for children and why is best for adult school employees.    We don’t have any data on the best way to learn outside of what we have done throughout human history - in person structured instruction which combines visual, verbal and physical cues."
2020-07-12 12:54:30,"It is definitely at shame that the US did not have a consistent approach to locking down. However, now is the chance for some consistency, while reopening schools that will give pupils and staff confidence, utilising lessons learned elsewhere. Opening schools is positive for so many reasons:
1) Their well-being overall - especially for those disadvantaged (providing safety and guidance, nutrition and dependability, especially where home life may not offer these elements).
2) Education matters and most educators agree that home learning is not as productive as learning in a community environment or context (school community/ classroom setting).
3) Mental health benefits (obvious)
4) Getting kids off the streets where they are already mingling, but in a less hospitable environment often."
2020-07-12 12:54:54,"I think most people here agree that opening schools is a bad idea until we get the pandemic under control.  It's been cathartic to voice our fears. The reality is that schools are going to open before we're ready. Most teachers are going to have to go back to the classroom. We have little to no say in the model our districts choose. The discussion needs to turn to what can be done to minimize the exposure risk.  We all know that schools aren't sanitary places and the cleanings will fall off after a short period of time. People get complacent. What do I personally need to do to protect myself and others? Should I wear a hazmat suit everyday?  If so, where do I get one?"
2020-07-12 12:55:48,"Districts are not being honest with themselves or with parents.   Teachers will not feel safe enough to return.  They have every right to protect themselves.  They aren't going back.   So if we start from there, districts should be examining best practices for distance learning and engagement.  They need to find ways to be more creative and more effective.   The transition to online education was poor in most cases.  And parents struggled trying to teach kids and keep their jobs.   Along with this, there does need to be some type of safe way to bring in those kids whose parents have no choice but to be at work.  Districts should be frantically working on these goals right now.   Instead they are wasting time on these hybrid fantasies that teachers will not agree to."
2020-07-12 12:58:19,"There is an elephant in the re-opening room. If she could speak she would tell us that none of these plans can achieve any of the intended goals. Parents will be unable to resume regular work schedules and the covid safety protocols offer few improvements over remote instruction - for kids or teachers. And, the inevitable closures that will soon follow will make all the effort and expense to re-open an exercise in futility."
2020-07-12 13:02:49,"We are ""all in this together"". Really? Where have we heard this before? We are all equal. Yes, but some are just more equal.

The reality is that COVID19 is the great equalizer. It does care about differences in wealth, race, education, ethnicity, or political party. If we allow any difference to determine who gets something and who doesn't, we all potentially could suffer.

The reality is that those who are left behind can have unintended consequences for those of us that are privileged. Basic rights can no longer be ignored. 

Too expensive? How is the depression going for you?"
2020-07-12 13:05:11,"The precautions schools required to take are way out of proportion to the risk to people under age 18.  All the US schools and CDC need to do is look to European countries for a great model on this.  But, like so much of what the CDC recommends, the recommendations are way off.  

We need to reform the CDC.  Look how badly they have performed throughout the Pandemic!"
2020-07-12 13:10:07,"Most of the thinking about reopening is centered around the pre-covid model with modifications. Move the desks farther apart; stagger the days students go to the school; rigorous screening. Certainly that is necessary.

However, what is needed is a new (or perhaps old) model of education. The problem is that any venue where large numbers of individuals are indoors and in close contact with one another is very problematic for creating a localized epidemic.  

The temporary solution may be to resurrect the one room school house. Educating children in small groups isolated from one another will prevent at least the explosive spread of Covid that is possible in large schools.

Is that possible? Under certain circumstances, challenging but doable! As businesses have closed, there is an abundance of empty space. An important function of any school is to provide appropriate nutrition. The devastated restaurant industry could easily deliver student meals which would help that industry as well. Many supplies such as desks could be moved out of our present schools. Such as system might require far more teachers. Our society has laid off many teachers for tax reasons. The 40 million recently unemployed certainly includes a large number of teachers. This model works best for elementary and middle schools where a single teacher can remain with a single group throughout the day.  For higher levels, small supervised group on line education could also keep students in a school setting."
2020-07-12 13:11:28,"This may or may not be true, but my understanding in countries like Germany, students do not leave their classrooms. It's the teachers who move to each place, which will obviously stop potential transmission of the virus. Secondly, students are in school for shorter hours, but are given lots of homework to do outside of school to complete. All of this flies in the face of the American system. Germany also weeds students out at about age 12 to see what track they will put on, university track or vocational. This fundamentally changes the environment for most high school and middle school level children."
2020-07-12 13:13:39,"“There is really damage to kids if they don’t go to school,” Dr. Edwards said. “I think we have got to think of the kids and getting them back to school safely.” What will safely cost? Retrofitting schools ventilation and air purification must be first. Rebreathing air in a classroom will do far more harm than the damage from not attending school. The scent of perfume in a classroom tells us that airborne virus will infect."
2020-07-12 13:22:08,"Teachers must refuse to work in unsafe conditions. I want them all to survive this pandemic. There are possible solutions, clear physical barriers and micro phones, updated air handlers, increasing staff to lower class size,  but they all cost money that school districts don't have to spend. Absent the implementation of a plan that offers safety to all staff there will be more virus surges, deaths, and possible and permanent disability that has affected those who recover if school reopen. There are far too many unknowns. Teachers have been front line workers in this country's entrenched school funding inequality scheme, they must not enter ckassroom without proper infastrurcture to limit viral spread, but that will take funding local districts don't have."
2020-07-12 13:24:16,"In every article I've read on this, no-one addresses transportation. We live in a regional school district with both  academic and vocational high schools. The academic high school is in a neighboring town which is up to 15 miles away for some students. Our town is rural, virtually no elementary students walk to school. The vocational school serves nine towns, some students live 25 miles away! There is no money in town budgets for additional busing. How do these children travel back and forth to school in a safe environment? Why does no-one address this complex issue that won't be solved with simplistic solutions or, worse yet, by ignoring the elephant in the room completely."
2020-07-12 13:26:03,"When I  read my district's back to school plan where I work and my children attend a couple days ago, I began to go through the stages of grief. I visited a charter school which is planning to open fully with one of my children. The principal was so nice and had 3 children at the school. She is now begging me to go back to school shopping all the time for her new school. I have to remind her that school will not start for month and a half. I am also preparing her for the possibility that even this school may be closed. She is done with summer break that has been going since March. Those of us who work in schools and have children in schools are willing to do what it takes and risk our health a small amount for school to open.  Children need school for academics and socializing. Parents want school open for their children's wellbeing and their own. I  have an underlying health condition, high blood pressure from pre eclampsia that never went away. This pandemic has really shown to me more clearly than ever that it does take a village to raise a child. It would be much more feasible for my 12 year old to do online school than my younger children. Let's at the least open for them, since they seem not to transmit the virus at a high rate. Let's use federal stimulus money to help make it safe. Just a perspective from someone highly affected from schools being closed."
2020-07-12 13:27:47,"My three grade school children will not be returning to school this Fall.  My wife and I after consulting with school officials as well as several experts including a virologist have decided not to take the chance this Fall, and instead will take a wait and see approach.

Our decision came down to the schools telling us that while they are going to make the schools safer, they hesitated to say that the schools will be safe, and then added that we will not know if the schools are safe until probably November - December when we see how the children are fairing with the virus.  The idea that my three children would be used like lab rats in a school Covid protocol experiment is not acceptable to me or my spouse.

In our opinion it would be parental malfeasance to endanger our children in this manner, but we respect and support the parents who either disagree with our position or have no other choice.  Regardless, we are all in this together.

So, this week we have already begun homeschooling for the next school year for our three children with the hope that we will have them well prepared to start back in January 2021.  We should know a lot more by January what the impact to children attending schools in person represents."

2020-07-12 12:42:06,"All this happy talk of plans to achieve our goals, ignores the reality of the ""United States"" and our ""Government"".

  Professionals to set standards based on knowledge
  Government to mandate consistent best practices
  Government to fund and organize needs
  Prevent framing of the pandemic as a ""hoax"" forcing divides
  The telling of truth
  Testing
  Tracing
  Quarantine

What has the United States done to achieve any of the above, the answer is nothing?  My belief is that the ship has sailed and we will pay a huge price as a Nation for our willful incompetence.

Having said that, as a Massachusetts resident, I'm comfortable my region has done this - for now. But nationally, this is what we rely on leaders for -- to make hard, unpopular decisions. Unfortunately our supply of reasonable, strong-boned leaders is in sad and short supply. Without the political will to mandate and enforce public health guidelines, and given a populace without comity, a shared ability to sacrifice, and faith in public institutions, we lost our battle months ago.

2020-07-12 13:21:17,"""But there is enormous pressure to bring students back — from parents, from pediatricians and child development specialists, and from President Trump.""

And the editorial Board of the NY Times on 7/10/20, ""Reopening Schools Will Be a Huge Undertaking. It Must Be Done."" :

""Many teachers, and parents, are wary of reopening schools.""

 ""the evidence is not conclusive"" 

More positive reinforcement to open: 

“I’m just going to say it: It feels like we’re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,” said Robin Cogan, a nurse at the Yorkship School in Camden, N.J., who serves on the state’s committee on reopening schools.

Kids and masks? : ""experience abroad has shown that measures such as physical distancing and wearing masks in schools can make a difference."" 

Again : "" “First you have to control the community spread and then you have to open schools thoughtfully.” "" We have the virus controlled in our communities?


More :The risk of reopening “will depend on how well schools contain transmission, with masks, for instance, or limiting occupancy,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and statistics.

""There have not yet been rigorous scientific studies on the potential for school-based spread, but a smattering of case reports, most of them not yet peer-reviewed, bolster the notion that it is not inevitably a high risk.""


Why the big push to open the schools? Economics it appears. Reopening economies seem to be increasing the spreading of Covid-19."
2020-07-12 02:43:38,"As chaotic and ill-prepared as the National response has been, as disjointed at the State and Local levels, and with this vast expansion of COVID-19 across the population because of political interference to science based policy; my conclusion is that our Nation has set its course on creating a vast cohort of orphans. Schools will become petri dishes, infecting previously sustainable, relatively safe households.  One step more perverse to children in cages in my opinion.  The EU has already banned Americans from traveling into their zone.  This next step will cement our standing, a nation in abject, spiraling failure.  America, if my fear comes true, will be fully dystopian in the eyes of the world.  We are imploding, while the pestilent one tweets."

In other words, people get the funds before the national lockdown starts. This enables everyone to be provisioned to stay at home. This works the evidence is out there. The virus is totally out of control in this country and it is insane to be talking about opening schools, playing sports, and so on. We are indeed an exceptional nation to be discussing reopening the nation while it is (invisibly) burning down before our eyes."

2020-07-12 11:29:45,"As a former teacher and principal of high school, I have had calls from colleagues who run by me their plans for reopening--what I now term, magical thinking phone calls. Most of these calls are coming from high schools with over 2, 500 students in buildings that  are quite old, with some updated additions. Here we go...alternative attendance days, one day off for cleaning, all kids will be wearing masks, on and on...I don't want to be the person in the room asking how all these magic tricks work in real time. Behind the magic school curtain these schools will still have too many students in a building, they will be moving too much, they will be sitting in poorly ventilated classrooms, classrooms/bathrooms will not be sanitized properly, students will not social distant or wear masks all day (they are not being disobedient; they are being adolescent), they will taught by at-risks teachers (or in a few weeks of opening a substitute teacher or a teacher not certified in the subject area); and, by October or so, the magic will end--as it has in Texas, Florida---the schools will close down. I won't get into the magical extra-curricular plans, or magical bussing plans, or even where all of this magical money is coming from all of these magical plans. Not to get political, but our Magician in Chief bears a heavy burden for the carnage he is now pushing on to children, teachers, administrators, and parent."

Also, I suggest parents of young schoolchildren memorize this line to recite to their children: ""It's not anything you did little John/Jane. You didn't know you were infected. It's not your fault (insert teacher/parent/grandparent) died. The adults made these decisions."" I'm serious. Memorize the line."

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Put everything on hold. When this is all over make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days.

Schools cannot fix most of our societies problems yet we continue to expect them to. Schools cannot create thriving middle class neighborhoods (it’s the other way around).  Schools cannot make adults follow cdc guidelines. Or legislators pass bills for more $. A “failing” school is usually a sign of a much larger problem in that society.

2020-07-12 13:37:07,"As mentioned in this article, the greatest impact from school closings will happen in poor communities. Of course, those parents have the least power to press for school openings & their children will fall behind the children whose parents can afford tutors etc.

I did a little research and found that during the polio epidemic which had many young victims there weren’t nation wide school closures. Chicago pushed back school year openings by three weeks & the system conducted classes over the radio! No one considered closing schools for nearly a year...or longer...& the victims were CHILDREN! 

Health can be categorized as social, emotional, physical & educational. One category can not paralyze the three others.

And I do wonder...why we have not heard what private schools are doing? Are they opening? If so, that will again widen the gap between rich & poor."

Students eating lunch they brought from home at their desk. Or classes half day. Wearing masks once they leave their desk. Teachers provided with N95 masks.  ANd of course washing hands frequently. And urge students to stay away from others for now. Explaining the reasons for doing so until this pandemic is in control, virus weakend and vaccines are available.

This should all be paid for by our federal Government, as is in most of Europe and modern societies. Our Government has an obligation, after an extreme failure to shot down everything at the beginning of March. I knew this is a pandemic. So why go around saying it will all be over in two weeks, its only a cold or a flu like others? Our President and Senate mostly have no problem giving billion$ tax cuts to billionaires.

2020-07-12 13:43:25,"The data is clear: kids under 18 do not get seriously ill from Covid-19. In fact, they are much more likely to die from influenza and no one is suggesting we shut down schools because 197 kids have died from influenza this year (40 from Covid). So let’s take “keeping kids safe and healthy” out of the debate. 
The question then becomes, how do we help prevent teachers and staff from getting infected. Limiting the number of kids in classes and how close they are to one another curtails the spread amongst the kids themselves, but not between kids and adults. So if schools are going to open, they might as well be fully open. For elementary school, the data strongly indicates children do not spread the disease to adults so teachers/staff wearing masks when they come in close contact w the children vigilant hand washing should prevent risk of transmission beyond what those same adults experience outside of school.  For middle/high schools, classes could be held outside whenever possible and inside, teachers and staff should wear masks and maintain 6ft from kids & adults just as they do outside of school. We cannot eliminate all risk, but we can make the risk of infection on par with risks we accepted without second thought before Coronavirus. Furthermore,the measuring stick for whether it’s safe to reopen schools should not be an increase in cases but whether or not it’s leading to hospitals being overwhelmed which was the justification for shutting them down in the first place."

It's less complicated to stay online for now IF we impose bell schedules and force students to Zoom during their regularly scheduled class. We could cut the fat out of the curriculum.

What kind of socializing will they be doing when they can't hold hands, hug each other, comfort each other, sit together, share a lunch, rough and tumble on the playground or any of the social interactions that make us human? How will they not be psychologically harmed when they are reprimanded by a teacher for holding hands, hugging a crying friend who fell and scraped her knee? It seems that this type of damage, that forcibly removes compassion and empathy from our human response, would be far more damaging than missing a few more months of school. We will be turning our children into unfeeling robots. How is this good for them and society? How will this not damage their psyche?"
2020-07-12 13:45:21,"There’s only one safe way...online learning for the first semester at least.  Now, for high school age that’s doable albeit not ideal.  The problem is grade school students.  Can’t leave them home alone...parents need to work.  So I propose that if the high schools are empty (online) we can spread the grade school students out into that building and, yes, hire more assistants or teachers (even coming right out of school - hey, it’s an emergency).
For HS students with no internet we need to supply them with at least a phone as many apps work with those.  This would be on the school districts (easy for me to say)."
2020-07-12 13:47:37,"Most of the commenters here don’t seem to have even read the article. The data shows children transmit the virus at much lower rates than adults. Thousands of schools around the world have reopened without sparking new outbreaks.

Sad to see many Americans in these comments, even liberal ones, reject any science or data that challenges their emotional narratives. The refusal to even acknowledge the experiences and expertise of other nations shows how deeply rooted American exceptionalism is."
2020-07-12 13:47:50,"How can we open schools safely, when some parents do not even believe in wearing mask in public? The health of my child is more important than school at the moment. A lost year of education is not a problem, but to lose your child to the virus is not worth it at all."
2020-07-12 13:48:19,"You can all enjoy rearranging the deck chairs by trying to resume schools in-person. This parent is keeping their child home.

See you in mid to late October when you're back home too."
2020-07-12 13:50:37,"What do we know today: 
1) DJT or Pence or WH guidelines should be the last person we shall listen to. 
2) One size does not fit all. There are many teachers and staff are old (60+) in many school districts and prune to Covid-19 than children. 
3) Having all kids attending all together is very dangerous. 
Having 50 pct capacity with an alternate school days appears to be safe bet with mask."
2020-07-12 13:55:18,"There is not a single country mentioned in this article that has attempted to open up their schools with the virus raging through the population like it is in the US.  The absolute failure of  the national government, many state governments and too many of our own citizens to embrace sacrifice with a coordinated response based in science leads me to believe that, right now, it is folly to even discuss the issue.  Getting the virus under control is the threshold issue.  Nothing can be done until that is accomplished.  Period."
2020-07-12 13:58:39,"The choice to keep kids home is not a choice of keeping kids healthy.  Children must attend in person classes for their education needs.  Having said that, children attending class can be dangerous.  A child in school can unknowingly contract the virus and spread it to adults who in turn spread it to other adults.  
In my mind the schools should be responsibly opened.  The risk to a child's educational development is far too great to not open."
2020-07-12 14:01:38,"I am a retired teacher. I taught in High School for 33 years, and retired for the past 15. Many of us who have been retired school officials have had extensive chat discussions on line covering the social and community challenges that now present themselves. I am in a community of only about 120,000 and 28,000 public school kids. Usual building sizes from elementary through high schools that teach 1,500 to 2,000 kids faculty, staff and adminsistration a day five days a week. What to do in an informal discussion manner have been discussions included mostly on the high school level and categories... first priority 100% reliable testing of virus and antibodies. Second mandatorymask wearing of everyone in the building. Third of course extensive disinfection of school building, and daily intensive cleaning. Desks six feet apart. Then the contrast in viewpoints included how to schedule, who moves between rooms, how many in the building at the same time, regular versus block schedules, staggered start, staggered year round scheduling, virtual scheduling versus in person, sports, food service, etc., etc., etc...Far from quick decisions can be made. Extensive challenge to be sure. The safety, health, of the kids, staff, faculty, admins., parents, transportation aspects etc and the great community have to be met.  Good luck..."
2020-07-12 14:05:58,"Schools should not open for physical presence of students until and unless there is clear evidence that the pandemic is subsiding in this country. To do otherwise is endangering everyone (unless they already have antibody protection).
There are no solid, convincing data to support ""opening"". 
This is not rocket science."
2020-07-12 14:06:11,"Betsy Devos was interviewed by Dana Bash on CNN this morning.  Among other things, she opined children had a low incidence of COVID and that if school hot spots occurred, they'd be dealt with on an individual basis. As for the CDC, their school opening guidelines were ""recommendations.""

My thoughts: are all school employees considered Essential Workers?  Has anyone considered giving them ""combat pay for working in dangerous conditions?  So what if students are less likely to be sick?  What about infecting older staff?

In NY State, the Taylor Law forbids public employees striking; maybe it's time teachers override that in order to protect public health?"
2020-07-12 14:07:22,"Well balanced and candid coverage of this problem for which there is no solution in US given the extent of infection and lack of federal leadership. Thinking critically of schools in a Covid-19 era lays bare the realities that schools are (among other things) publicly subsidized day cares which companies profit from by being provided with a stable and focused workforce. Once again, it's a system of socialized cost but a privatizing of the profit. 

Where are the corporations in this discussion? Why should this be 100% on the backs of middle class taxpayers to fund while corporations benefit from the workforce and in some cases don't even pay taxes themselves?"
2020-07-12 14:08:30,"If my old classroom had to accommodate student desks spaced 6 feet apart, there would’ve been no more than 8 or 10 students in my classroom. My normal classes had 28-30 students, so this is less than half. (In order to fit 28-30 kids in my classroom space, I had them sit with their desks in groups of 4 or 5). 

If students are required to travel from class to class (which would be needed in my subject, chemistry), traveling while walking 6’ apart would take about 4 times the time required in between classes. 

Many schools have few or no windows that open. When I was teaching, I got multiple respiratory infections a year. My first year in retirement, I never got sick. 

Many schools bus students from miles away, because much of the US has done away with neighborhood schools. Busing will be a problem, even with a staggered schedule. Imagine the logistical nightmare of bus routes with a staggered schedule.

Unless the school administration is willing to have a backbone and enforce mask wearing, then teachers will now be faced with trying to enforce that, too. My experience with school administrators being consistent with enforcing rules tells me this is a fantasy. 

The only way to reopen a school is to reimagine what the concept of a school is. Right now that’s not happening. What’s happening now is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole."
2020-07-12 14:10:55,"All countries that opened schools up have experienced a spike in transmissions.  It should also be said that American schools are very different than schools in other countries--These differences will exacerbate transmissions in American classrooms.

American schools have a very different culture.  Most American parents think nothing of giving a child an aspirin before sending their sick child to school, thus sick students will bypass temperature checks.  American students have a culture of resistance.  Many American students will ignore or fight against safety protocol.  

American schools are also massively underfunded when compared to schools in other countries.  To make things worse, most American school districts have had their budgets cut by 10%.  The custodians in American schools are stretched thin and never could keep classrooms clean before this pandemic.  They will not be able to keep them clean now.  Americans schools are also overcrowded.  If we break classrooms in to smaller bubbles, we need double the number of classes and double the teachers.

American doctors can't get the PPE they need.  Students and teachers will also not have the PPE they need.

Most school board members are not very good at what they do.  There is no way a school board will be able to design and implement a safe school system.  Although school districts will have no real safety measures in place, they will still tell parents that there are safety measures in place."
2020-07-12 14:11:21,"Local circumstances should be the primary driver of decisions. In MA, the situation is not far from that in Europe in terms of new infections and it would make sense for the schools to open and they should safely.  

Perhaps in certain communities in Florida, Texas and California, the decision could be different.

As for young children, it seem so strange that no one considers that they are SMALL and when the breath, cough and or otherwise potentially spread the virus, the force of gravity will cause much to fall quickly to the ground so adults cannot breath it (some may aerosol, so perhaps there is a small risk but it is a fraction of the risk otherwise).  

Obviously, in high school, the children are nearly full size and that benefit fades, but high schools can be made to wear masks when around teachers and staff thus making virus transmission much more difficult.

Ultimately, the problem is we can't know unless we try.  Schools must open and react to events as they happen. We should know within two to four weeks what the real impact will be.

There is no possibility that cases will go to zero and the virus eradicated without a highly affective vaccine, so waiting for such a perfect storm solution is a non-starter."
2020-07-12 14:15:10,"It is reasonably clear to understand the scope and sequence of the work necessary in order to open schools somewhat safely.

The question should be now: what have the federal, state, and local governments and school districts done so far to achieve this somewhat safe reopening of schools?"
2020-07-12 14:15:33,"So, basically, no one knows anything for certain. Evidence is contradictory and unclear. Cases in the US are on the rise and breaking daily records. It just does not seem like a good idea to rush to reopen schools next month when remote learning is possible. It may not be the best, but it’s better than dying."
2020-07-12 14:16:39,"""Keeping schools closed for a prolonged period will have an adverse impact on children.""

An unchecked, out if control COVID-19 will close schools for a (longer) prolonged period. 

See you in October when schools have re-closed again."
2020-07-12 14:18:23,"Infection rates among adults must be first under control in order for kids to go back to school. If the teachers and parents are not well enough to attend school they will not be able to do their jobs and will further transmit the virus as their kids become vectors.  There will be then a lack of labor supply in the areas where Covid is a serious problem.  Isolation is the only way to get infections under control, and summer time is the best time to do it. It is the only way to save the next  school year.  

While I do agree that it is important for kids to attend school, the damage from missing a year of in class instruction is not irreparable.  Students take gap years, have their studies interrupted by wars and even family travel and they come out fine."
2020-07-12 14:18:29,"“I’m just going to say it: It feels like we’re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,” 
Choices in our society  almost always involves weighing the Cost of the general health of the people vs. the cost to the ""economy"".
If we had a genuine leader in Washington, intent on trying to attain the vital balance between health and wealth there could be a constructive, unified way the country could handle the crisis.
But in this particular America even an outside threat can't unify the people. When the leader's self interest is tied to keeping the people divided, only chaos and fear can flourish. If we can't agree on simple behaviors like using masks and social distancing, the prospect for overcoming the school dilemma is remote. But all of this is what Trump voters bargained for in 2016. Create chaos and see where it leads was their gamble. Well, it leads to where we are today, with no particular destination in sight."
2020-07-12 14:21:32,"I have a daughter who is an elementary school teacher. She teaches Grade Two and these students' hygiene is not great in a regular year, let alone now. Despite her going into her eleventh year of teaching, she always comes down with something spread by the kids in the fall. School boards must have finalized plans to the province by August 4th. The province has already said that returning to school is voluntary and remote instruction will be available for parents who choose not to send their kids back. Key advice the Ministry of Education is going by is ""distancing"" and ""cohorting."" Both approaches indicate a limit of 15 students in a class. How this is going to be accomplished with teachers responsible for remote learning for some and hybrid for others without increasing teacher numbers remains to be seen. On a personal level, I'm concerned for my daughter's health and safety and that of her soon-to-be husband who has underlying conditions. On top of it all, they want to start a family right away and I worry about my pregnant daughter contracting the virus. The health and safety of students and all staff must be a priority. Anxiously awaiting August 4th!"
2020-07-12 14:22:04,"Hong Kong had some 30 cases couple of days ago, and they closed school year early for the entire city. Asian countries’ goal appears to be eliminating the virus entirely early on, not just flattening the curve. I don’t know what we’ve achieved with half measures in the past 4 months. Maybe they’re right, we’re wrong."
2020-07-12 14:23:02,"Elementary age children typically have young parents.  The data quoted here shows less transmission for this age of kids and survivability for children and parents.  I agree that there is a significant risk for ""teachers of a certain age"" (as my teacher friends say) but I think that they need to continue to furlough which is a sacrifice on their part, but since they make dramatically more money than young teachers, it's hard to feel that its as much of a sacrifice as that of the young parents whose young children's lives could be permanently scarred by the lack of school this year!
And I'm ""of a certain age"" myself so it's not as though I don't see their point of view."
2020-07-12 14:24:28,"Time to rethink schools - at least on a temporary basis. Abandon the industrial model where schools are like meat packing plants with up to a thousand or more students crammed into one facility. Where an outbreak might lead to hundreds of infected individuals. At least temporarily, reconsider the ""one room school house"" model with personalized education in small groups at satellite locations. Lots of challenges but also much safer. Many of the mundane tasks such as testing and assessments could then be performed and tracked on line through central locations. Even off site nursing services could be provided on line as is increasingly the case with primary health care. Food services can easily be managed through delivery services of local restaurants. If there is a covid exposure, no need to send home a thousand students - only a small number would require isolation and exposure tracking."

I have nieces and nephews who are tuning out of their online instruction, maybe if it was more like Sesame Street (age -appropriate), they would be learning more."
2020-07-12 14:26:34,"When students do eventually return to campus, it will be important for them to be properly spaced out; this will be easy for me, as my students have been totally spaced out in class for my entire career."

So the teachers or one of the other workers or a child are going to come home. And where will the  people that are most vulnerable going to go. Oh yeah. I forgot. We will be isolated taken care of as the society opens up. And this too will be in place by September."

2020-07-12 13:58:27,"More than two weeks ago, I heard Dr. Fauci state that these four things HAVE to be in place for anyone/everyone--not just students and teachers-- to be safe.

1. Mandatory masks (almost all governors have backed off this no brainer, and even where governors have called for it, many sheriffs and mayors have refused to enforce it).

2. Strict social distancing; we now think 6 feet is the bare minimum; a letter writer here just noted that her school has arbitrarily changed that to 3 feet (?!?). 

3. Not staying in the same room for longer than an hour, and that room must be well-ventilated. Many schools have windows sealed shut and hundred-year-old air systems.

4. Avoiding places where people are talking/shouting/singing, as these all enhance aerosol spread.

Schools self-evidently meet NONE of these criteria. So why is this even a debate?"

Seriously? In an article about the way to safely open schools! I rest my case."
2020-07-12 12:25:42,"The photo of kids in Bangkok sitting on the floor made me wonder why we make our kids sit on hard, uncomfortable chairs.

2020-07-12 13:28:20,"Since this administration seems unable to think in chunks larger than a tweet, let me simplify for them.

￼Lesson one: ￼first, control the virus, then open the schools.￼ 
Lesson two: lots of extra equipment is required, and that costs money.
Lesson three: mobilize the army to help with disinfection. 
Lesson four: Do not try to open schools at full capacity.￼ If kids are only going to school every other day, parents still cannot go back to their jobs.￼￼ 


Unfortunately, the administration is clearly focused on creating the illusion of normalcy rather than addressing the real problems. ￼"
2020-07-12 12:11:13,"The challenge is complicated by a 300 pound buffoon whose only concern is his reelection. Trump has shut down science by firing doctors whose message differs from Trump's so we'll never know what methods keep our kids safe. Trump failed to act intelligently when seniors in nursing homes were dying at a record rate. He advocated drugs that didn't work, and cleansers that killed. Now that the fool has finally donned a mask, we're supposed to follow his lead on school reopening?

Every single day America doesn't rise up en mass and demand his removal from office, COVID will expand and kill more people. Fortunately for me, AZ allows home schooling and we have parents who are retired teachers.

Another is that a child should have been vaccinated for measles, TB, etc. and should provide proof of vaccination.

The idea behind this proof of vaccination is to ensure the safety of everyone: the other students and the teachers and staff.

Given that the pandemic is still raging to the point that the US is the worldwide hotspot with the most number of deaths and cases plus the lack of vaccine, what is the hurry in opening up schools?

Oh right.

There’s an election in the fall and Trump is willing to murder kids just so he can project some semblance of normalcy.

Since the edges of seats are typically about 6 inches in from the edges of the desk, he tells us that it’s therefore okay for the desks to be spaced 2 feet apart. This is as true for the kindergartners as it is for the 17-18 year old seniors. 

This will keep the kids 3 feet apart *only* if they sit bolt upright in their chairs and never once move during the entire day—never half turn sideways to speak to their neighbor, for instance. 

The kids will have to remain sitting bolt upright, facing forward like that, for the entire school day—not even moving for lunch, which they will have to eat sitting at those same desks. 

It’s hard to understand this except as deliberate cruelty—to the students, and to the teachers who have to be confined to a room with all 30 of them like this. 

If it’s not deliberate cruelty, Baker must have no understanding whatsoever of the needs and behaviors of kids—or, indeed, of any humans."

She has ordered a ton of cleanable face shields and will require the children to wear them while in her office. She herself will wear a mask AND face shield while around adults. We’re all grabbing hand wipes and cleaning wipes as we see them, so she can be sure to have a good stock.

Adult teachers, classroom aides, staff, bus drivers and parents, and caregivers encountering asymptomatic and potentially viral shedding and viral sharing child vectors without proper PPP and Infectious disease control procedures is only experimentally political, but neither clinically, experimentally nor morally acceptable.

When children return home from school petri dish environments, will parents or caregivers now need to quarantine their children or wear masks at home to protect themselves?

After an at-home evening or weekend with potentially asymptomatic, viral shedding children, when parents or caregivers return to their workplace, how do they answer the question, Have you been in contact with anyone showing symptoms or possible signs of COVID-19 when asked at their office door or business threshold?

Until safe vaccines are tested and available to all who want them, stay-at-home educational support is prudent and lifesaving, as is patience and not foolheartedly creating conditions for more patients and lives lost. Stay safe!"

Please hire me.)
The harm done to the young not attending school far out weighed any good closing school will do. The solution is astonishingly simple despite all the cluck cluck clucking of unnamed experts who gathered in the NYT farmyard. (PS I simply do not believe any statement in a news story that begins “experts say”.  This is an entirely new technique that began when global warming “deniers” had to be refuted without the tedium of actually addressing their fallacious arguments. In the good old days of journalism, most reporters cited sources—even if they were anonymous.)
All elementary and middle schools should reopen. High schools and colleges can remain online in high COVID areas. Teachers in vulnerable groups should be given paid furloughs until the disease subsides.

It is certain to be the challenge of a lifetime. But we’ll meet these challenges as we did in the spring. 

Educators will be the new frontline workers. As always, we will be dedicated to teaching your children and keeping them safe. Before reading another article, anxiously wondering what can I do? Think about how schools will be YOUR CHILDREN’S working environment! Your child will likely be sitting in a poorly ventilated classroom. The adults in charge will not be trained epidemiologists or healthcare professionals trained to deal with a novel infectious disease. ACT NOW! Do your part to keep schools safe. 

1. If you have not already, start modeling good health precautions like wearing a mask and social distancing. It’s about to get real.  It’s not an abstract political point. It’s teachers’ and children’s lives on the line.

If they are bad, then couldn't that be relevant to this decision?  If they are bad in some areas, why are they bad?  Is it perhaps because girls braid one another's hair, kids fight with each other, and there is not that much sitting at desks doing academic work?  In such environments, are kids going to wear masks and social distance?  Should we expect them to have more maturity and a social conscience than the president has shown?"
2020-07-12 14:49:55,"The pressure for colleges to open is clear: money (dorms, cafes, gyms).  The pressure to open K-12 also is money, if somewhat indirectly.

I guess an economy and culture that values money over lives, we should not only open schools and colleges, but all businesses and let the cards fall where they may.  I.e., it is senseless to talk about social distancing and masks in schools and colleges where nothing of that sort is enforceable.  Try telling sophomores to abandon happy hour and keep their clothes on.

There is an argument for opening everything, or shutting everything.  Everything else in between that favors masks and social distances is delusional; none of that is likely to happen.  Children will carry infections home, faculty will drop like flies, and so will administrators and staff in schools and colleges.  

Want to stay safe?  Shut it down.  All.  Want to ensure economic recovery rapidly, open it all up.  The phased opening has been disastrous among a population with no self-control, discipline, integrity, or empathy."
2020-07-12 14:51:07,"Every state has had a different response and course of COVID-19 and therefore if a state has met criteria discussing reopening the economy and schools makes perfect sense. 

However, as a whole this country looks terrible and this discussion on HOW to reopen schools really should be theoretical. The fact that we are discussing it as fact in states that are seeing massive climbs of the virus is disturbing to say the least. While children do tend to survive and suffer less, it’s still not clear how much can be transmitted to their parents and other family members. 

Every country mentioned in this article saw better control than we have as a country before they opened their schools. In some countries masking is more acceptable so in theory adherence should be better by children. In this country we can’t even get adults to agree to wear masks. 

Yes, we’d all like to get back to normal. We’d all like our kids to go to school because, yes, socialization of children is very important. However, so is physical health of the population. The fact that this issue has been politicized to an incredible extent is a travesty whose fruits we are now harvesting."

 Despite the explosion of new cases the numbers of dead and rates of hospitalization are not as bad as they were in a single state a couple of months ago.

2020-07-12 14:54:29,"While accepting the fact that it’s unlikely that we can open schools safely in the fall, any type of planning for remote instruction has to consider factors

—a low income middle schooler who has no internet access at home and whose parents will not provide any help with instruction
—a kindergartener with preschool aged siblings  whose parents are working demanding essential jobs from home and cycling into a mental health crisis
—the kid with IDD who needs professional 1:1 instruction 

Anything that is developed around remote instruction is going to be disproportionately bad for low income and already disadvantaged kids and families.

There’s a lot of “teachers aren’t babysitters” type of comments, but that is willfully obtuse to the fact that for decades, schools have performed a critical role in workforce support. Ignoring that fact doesn’t make go away. 

One of the better ideas I’ve heard is opening up school facilities, with staff (not necessarily professional teachers) who are lower risk, in order to provide a safe place to go for kids who need supervision, computer or internet access, and meals."

Well, now we are at zero level of internal cases and some controlled imported cases. Beaches are crowded under interpersonal control and economy slowly, but constantly recovering. Hospitals (public system where everyone is treated free of charge...) are almost empty of covid patients and (very important) other patients can now be treated for their diseases.
On the other hand, the above mentioned State, exited from the lock down too early and now it has a strong increase in deaths, very close to the Veneto death rate during the most hard period of the pandemic. Is it an example of coherent and logical administration ?"

My district has been providing computers to high school kids for a few years already and all our lessons are online 100%. There is no reason to get high school kids back to classes in this district and the rest of the country if they are transmitting the virus as much as adults (and they are given the equipment to work from home and provided hotspots if they need access to internet). If the people running this country want to open the schools fully then they need to allocate the funds that will bring the classes down to 10-15 children per class, increase teacher pay, give enough money for special ed and kids at risk, and increase funds to minority communities schools and english language learners. As a teacher, I know what other teachers think, and we have been sacrificed long enough already in this country with the meager pay, crumbling buildings which are falling apart and in general lack of respect for the job we do. We leave in a society that undervalues their teachers and I can foresee that many will resign this coming year if not taken into account when decisions are made."

My kids did indeed suffer being home this spring, the quarantine was hard emotionally and traditional learning was limited. Would I like them to return to school, of course! Can I imagine the hardship for working parents and the economy itself if schools stay closed, indeed yes! But what about the safety of teachers? When I go to the hospital I have protective gear to don and protocols to follow, both of which make viral transmission highly unlikely. And I took an oath to serve regardless of danger to myself. Teachers didn't sign on to be the guinea pigs of COVID! Some are older and vulnerable. Most of them depend on their benefits including health insurance, quitting is not an option. They will be indoors with dozens of kids, some symptomatic, some not, any of whom could be contagious. We can't open windows in Oregon when it's cold and rainy, so airborne transmission becomes a heightened possibility. We just were emailed the Portland Public Schools presumptive reopening plan and not word one about teacher safety. Our children are precious and their safety is paramount but let's not forget about the educators who will be walking into danger this fall, once again undervalued and expendable."

For those of you advocating that school must open for children's social well-being, how can school be beneficial to kids with masks and social distancing? How are young children going to react to seeing teachers masked and in shields? How will they react when a teacher or parent dies because they brought home the virus?

Trump is a TOTAL LOSER and anyone who follows his ignorant advice will lose as well. Yes, children need a classroom environment to learn social as well as academic skills. But there will be no value to open schools only to shut them down again after a short while. There are ways to practice social distancing and still provide in-person education at the elementary school level. Class sizes can be cut in half with classes given in half day sessions. Everyone must be provided with proper PPE. Other creative ideas should come from the teachers whose health must be protected so they can continue to provide the much needed face to face (with masks of course) educational experience.

It's amazing how much more secure and psycologically healthy it is to spend your time with with people you're actually bonded with and not have to deal with bullying, judgement, competition, cheating, feeling superior or inferior depending on your wardrobe, etc etc etc.
The bottom line IMO is that if you don't want to spend most of your time loving and teaching kids yourself until they are at least 16, don't have kids. It's an unnatural thing to reproduce and dump the kids off so you can go to work unless it's a matter of survival and not your BMW."

Experiential evidence indicates that vector is provided by the interactive habits of the human host population upon whom it depends. When that population alters its habits to block the vector, the microbes begin to die out for want of a vulnerable host and the rate of infection declines toward zero. That is documented fact.

The continuing, greater hazard is the often endemic human potential for social incoherence that allows and promotes the irrational pursuit of  toxic delusions.

That switches the focus of our dilemma from epidemiology to another discipline; Chaos Theory. The math is beyond me but a frequent pattern shows that a deliberate disregard for warning signs precedes catastrophic consequences.

So yes, we should look to other places and then ask ourselves: ""Will my school clean and fumigate?"" ""Will my school put soap in the bathrooms?"" (ours didn't) ""Is my child and his/her friends old enough to social distance?""

I bet that for most schools the answers are no -- there is simply no budget for disinfection! 

But there are other ways to education the kids and continue to work (yes, we all know that schools are used as child minding services, and that's okay). For example, one solution is educational family co-ops. It's not as difficult as it sounds -- several families get together, expand their quarantine bubble, and take responsibility to jointly teach their kids. It would take planning and coordination and negotiation, but it doable and it is SAFE! Please read about how to get started here: supermarketscience.com/about-us"

2020-07-12 12:22:39,"Speaking as a pediatrician, this is insanely stupid.

I hear that it is an economic necessity to provide parents with day care. There must be a better way to help the economy or provide parents with day care than exposing millions of children to a virus which they do catch, does get them sick, and in rare cases kills them or leaves them with permanent disability.

Yes, children are less likely to catch COVID19 than adults but nearly 2% of our COVID19 cases are in children. My children's hospital has had nearly 500 ER visits for COVID19, we have not had 500 ER visits in 3.5 months for any other diagnosis. A few kids were admitted to the ICU, none have died yet.

And they must spread it although the scientific consensus is not clear. Israel was down to less than 10 cases a day until they openend their schools.  Now they're seeing roughly 300 cases a day.  Their CDC chief equivalent resigned, acknowledging opening the schools was his mistake and was the cause of undoing everything they had accomplished.

Schools are dirty, kids don't follow rules, and I doubt enough schooling can be arranged to provide significant ""day care"" anyway.  I know virtual school has its problems, but let's optimistically assume this is temporary.  Illness, disability, and death are not temporary. 3 vaccines are starting phase III trials by the end of the summer.  Why would we risk killing and injuring our children now?

Stupidity and insanity from this pediatrician's perspective. My kid will be home."

But if it keeps schools closed, Black and Brown folks fare more poorly in distance learning than White folks. and non-Asian and non-White children will fall behind and fail. That's racist too.

Gee, you mean there was such a playbook— one that gave a framework to ask the necessary questions— set up by the Obama Administration?

That would imply several tens of thousands of hospitalized teachers and several thousand dead.   We need to state upfront that in-person school is so important for children's development that it is worth sacrificing thousands of lives for it

This isn't a choice many other countries are having to make, because they have the virus under much better control in their communities than the US, whose response has been among the worst.

Asking districts to plan for all three scenarios in 2 months is unreasonable and produces uneffective educational results for students.

While this article does make a number of good points, the horrifying Trumpian editorial cancels it out.  Underfunded schools cannot update their inadequate HVAC systems, expand spaces, provide enough PPE and sanitizing between classes, in hallways and in buses constantly.

The cost is the preventable deaths of teachers, staff, students, and their families as well as other community members.  

How many is it acceptable to sacrifice? What are acceptable levels of children, educators, and staff?  A few hundred? A few thousand?

My own child said that many students in her 8th grade classes didn't participate or do the assignments. Her teachers weren't available to answer questions. They never did any live instruction and she was done with her schoolwork by 10am each day. This is in a ""good"" school where many parents are affluent and involved and everybody including us has access to high speed internet and laptops.
If teachers were more concerned about providing quality education for all, whether it's online or in person, I would take their concerns about the virus more seriously. Perhaps this comment thread is an echo chamber but I only see teachers worried about themselves only here. No concerns for students' education except when it serves their own selfish  purposes. Instead, if seems like the virus provides a convenient excuse for resentfully blaming parents for being ""free daycare"", and literally phoning in their work. Teacher got away with that for a few months at the end of the last school year, but they won't get away with it indefinitely.

persuading parents to vaccinate their child with an unknown will increasingly be difficult, trying to re-open schools in different demographics will be challenging as rural areas may definetly not need the same care and assistance as Urban schools, then the social interactions need be maintained, small children do not have the full understanding of those 10+ years, the younger children want to play with friends, toys, hug the teacher, the older children and teens can interact per social media, but still need to find a balance for face to face communication, many at that age, especially females tend to be vain, so keeping a mask or social distancing will be a challenge, it also will mean transportation will become the first point of contact for many, how to keep the masks and social distancing at the same time as safely driving the bus, upon return home there is no guarantee that the child has not contracted the disease and can do transference. If Trump would spend as much time on COVID as he does on golf, twitter, denigrating others, then the outcome of a safe reopening could occur"
2020-07-12 16:10:12,"I just recently retired from teaching this June and I feel for my colleagues who will have to go back to all these mixed messages about school opening this fall. Think about this: what if a teacher gets sick and there are no subs because they don't want to catch covid-19? Do they cancel class and what if it is a bunch of teachers out? Principals cannot cover all classes. Don't get me wrong, I love my students but they are major germ spreaders especially in the younger grades and though there is research says it is not as prevalent. Try teaching in an overcrowded classroom of 29 students, a 30 year old and termite infested portable room and one door out germs are going to be prevalent. On the flip side us teachers have probably developed some sort of immunity to the many viruses we encounter every year but that doesn't mean we sacrifice ourselves to covid 19 with insufficient help and means.

My solution: (wishful thinking) Have those officials in higher office whether it be federal and local go teach during the pandemic."

When Iceland, Norway and Denmark locked down hard March 12-13, these nations were hit hardest among the Nordic nations. Iceland with 368 cases per million, Norway 186, Denmark 138, Sweden 57, Finland 41. Sweden never closed nurseries and primary schools, Finland later and diverse. After 4 weeks DK, NO and IS gradually reopened schools.

No Nordic nation registered large outbreaks linked to schools and nurseries, until now. However testing is sparse with only Denmark and Iceland in the world top 12, DK 208k and IS 277k finished tests per million citizens (US is about 126k), but Denmark has by far the highest population per Km2. (6 times Sweden and more towards the others).

For now the community spread in Sweden is about 30-50 times the spread in the other Nordic nations.

In the 0-9 year age group Denmark count 370 cases with 20 hospitalized, 0 deaths. Sweden 448, 0 hospitalized, 0 deaths. 

In the 10-19 year group Denmark count 648 cases, 22 hospitalized, 0 deaths, Sweden 2,945 cases, 13 hospitalized, 0 deaths.

Denmark has tested 3.5 times as many as Sweden, it's part of the picture. Denmark is 5.8 m and 12,888 cases, Sweden 10.2 m and 74,898 cases.

The 0-9 age group seems at low risk, but they can catch the virus and contribute to the community spread. However, reopening schools demand disciplin among all parents and staff, and to some degree the kids too. Swedes and Danes are in general rather responsible."

Teachers are going to be spending most of their time attempting to keep the kids separate and masked. I fail to see where the scholastic outcomes are going to make much difference. My guess is that schools reopening will go the way of the failed opening of bars.

However, when parents ""make it rich"" they immediately send their kids to private schools. Why? Is Betsy DeVos, our ""Education Secretary"", interested in clean, safe public schools, or only funding for religious schools? What initiatives have been taken for prevention of disease transmission using non pharmacological measures? RN's in schools are controversial, there are not enough bathrooms or custodians to clean them, enough teachers or space. We have the political will to give tax breaks for luxury housing (even in so called liberal New York). Can we ask those Fortune 500's to fund some schools with the federal taxes they skirt? It really comes down to how much Americans value children, doesn't it?  Do we value the health and education of our children as much as parents in Denmark, China, Italy or Germany? Apparently not, because those nations have made and instituted plans for education during a pandemic, because they believe in public health."

That it would need a real appreciation  and respect for the science and epidemiology to respond to a dangerous time in our history. He did this while having to to maintain a political distance from criticizing the political powers in charge. A difficult situation at best dealing with an organized system of denial, misinformation and flat out negligence during an election year. As it stands, he has been correct in his assessments and the merely obvious should now be enough to make it clear what we have been negligent as a nation ,what we need to do better to survive this. Since our leadership is so fragmented, it falls to us as individuals to understand that ,while it may be our civil rights to have free will as to wearing masks , distancing and basic hygiene....that it may be higher standard of civil responsibility that should be guiding our actions for our own safety , the safety of our families, friends and fellow citizens.

In the photo, no one was wearing masks or physically distancing themselves from others. Now just months later, the focus on hand washing without attention to mask wearing and physical distancing seems naive.More recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics  ""strongly advocate[d] that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school"" - a policy that the AAP has already had to ""clarify"" because it began with a goal of putting students physically back in classrooms which is scientifically insupportable. We should recognize that the United States is far from controlling the outbreak and we should be humble in the face of such a potent threat. Successful school reopening has been accomplished only in countries that have controlled their Covid-19 outbreaks, so our priority should be to control the pandemic which currently is surging across much of the United States. Plans to reopen school by the end of August or early September across the US already seem hopelessly naive. Let science and public health considerations that include the needs of teachers and communities in addition to those of students dictate the course of school reopening."

The land area of South Korea is about 38,000 square miles, the land area of Louisiana is approximately 52,000 sq miles.  The total Covid infections in South Korea are about 13,091 with 283 deaths. In Louisiana the total is about 76,911 infections with 3,403 deaths.
South Korea has more than ten times the population concentrated in a much smaller territory but they have a fraction of the infections and deaths of Louisiana.  That's just one state compared to one country.  What works in Bangkok Thailand won't work anywhere in the USA.  The kids don't even behave the same when given the same basic instructions on how to wash hands. There is a fundamental difference in how people think from infancy and teaching people to avoid infection of a virus is all about behavior modification, which includes the level of education."
2020-07-12 16:31:25,"Another huge challenge to safety in NYC school: commuting. Most of our students get to school on public transportation. Teachers, school staff, and parents are not going to be on the subways and buses with the kids, which means there's no way to ensure the kids are wearing masks and social distancing on their way to and from school. Anyone counting on all the kids to be prudent and consistent in following these guidelines when they don't have to is deluded. Some will, but plenty will not. (Even in the schools, under the supervision of adults, getting 100% compliance is going to be a challenge, as most high school teachers will affirm.) With kids being on subways and buses -- many for a good deal longer than 45 minutes each way -- you can count on there being a surge of infections. I'm not saying that kids should not go to school, but if this isn't done with a solid plan that does a good job of properly minimizing risk of infection, it's going to be a disaster. (And for all the scoffers who say that life is full of risks and just get over it -- I wonder how eager you would be to shadow our teachers and school staff for even just one month.)"
2020-07-12 16:34:41,"Do we have the ability to test every single student before they go to school? If not, we can't open.

Could we have the ability to test every single student, albeit using tests that might produce a larger number of false positives than we wish? Yes, we have that ability.

Would doing this pretty much tell us whether we could reopen our schools? I'm not certain, but I think so. 

Will this get done under the present administration?( Does anyone not know the answer to this question?)"
2020-07-12 16:38:15,"Most of the comments have been about what scientists, politicians and parents think about re-opening schools.

What do the children want?  Is the desire to go to school different for different age groups?  Are some children doing as well or better not being in school?

Since adults are projecting their joyful school and playground experiences onto what they want for their children, are they able to see that it won't be the same?  No games of tag, roughhousing, fellowship... instead, forced separation, constant monitoring to make sure they are following guidelines, a fear about getting sick.  

Especially for younger children, this might not be the environment we want to send children into, no matter how careful the school is."
2020-07-12 16:45:21,"Putting innocent kids of all ages into an uncontrolled experiment vis-à-vis Covid-19 seems like a very bad idea.

With medical facilities sometimes struggling with issues relating to protective equipment, how can children of any age be expected to adhere to guidelines such as distancing and using face masks. Washing hands frequently is yet another matter. And what are the effects on school staff?

Further, opening schools for one or several days a week raises issues about how children will learn when they cannot access the traditional classroom setting. I was unimpressed, as a former educator, at online lessons I witnessed, but how could a thorough system of instruction be implemented amid all of the chaos of this pandemic?

Family needs are yet another issue. Where do people who have to work send their children if school is not in session five days a week?

What a horrid and catastrophic mess!"
2020-07-12 16:48:06,"Yesterday an analysis reported that 1 in 4 teachers has a much greater risk of contracting Covid-19. The other day, the AAP walked backed their initial suggestions that kids should return to classes, explaining that during the current spread, this issue should be approached with caution and it shouldn’t be “politicized”. And the CDC just clarified that it’s sticking by its original safety guidelines for social distancing. These safety measures schools cannot guarantee right now. And to add to that, the US represents 25% of the worlds cases, and it’s growing. Many doctors are also growing very vocal about the dangers of moving too soon on this as a result of the changing nature of what we’re dealing with. Oh, and the autumn weather is around the corner.

The fact that there is an earnest conversation about returning back to the schools as early as August in some states without leadership, a coherent plan, resources, or consensus is frightening. Yet, this feels typical of the US in 2020."

A month before school should start the raging issue -- the only huge issue -- is sending kids back to school. This problem should have been addressed four months ago. The lack of planning is an egregious error, not just a slight oversight.

Successful businesses would start well ahead of time and experts would plot a critical path to achieving that goal! Instead, Americans have waited until it is a crisis and then started  talking about it.

What did we do? We decided we were bored with the pandemic.  We ignored experts because the numbers were falling and took off our masks and partied. The numbers went back up, surprise.

Now it is time to send kids back to school and we discover -- shock -- it isn't just a matter of unlocking the front door of the school.

Oh, and our great and fearless leader is now doing the only thing he knows.  He, like us, waited until it was too late and then, rather than providing federal resources to plan a safe critical path, THREATENED us with consequences if schools are not opened.

If we have learned anything at all 1) Trump is incapable of running a large business (remember the many bankruptcies and lawsuits) 2) We need a leader who can do that, not just promise us the moon 3) Votes must elect competent leaders, not feel good liars."

2020-07-12 16:28:39,"The reporting for this story really should have included the perspective of an education reporter, who could have added how all this science might play out day to day on the ground in an average school. 

Imagine how many little kids are in a class every day with coughs, sneezes, runny noses, upset stomachs, or just “don’t feel good.” What’s the protocol? Do you send every single one of them home? Where are those tests going to come from? If they show symptoms, where do you even hold them so they’re not an infection risk to others? Do you think their parents are going to be happy having to leave work to come pick them up when it turns out not to be coronavirus? + many many more questions, X (hundreds of thousands of schools) X (every day). 

Plus all the teachers are on vacation right now, with school admin and public health officials and govt still on different pages, with the issue getting more politicized by the day. 

August, mid August is going to be here in a flash and we’re all going to have a couple weeks to figure out, implement, deal with some shaky plan that may or may not work, with leadership at many levels that may or may not know what they’re doing. 

Hope it works out for my family and my two kids, but will not be surprised if it doesn’t."

Gamma globulin is a safe effective treatment that has been around for decades.  The problem is the drug companies make more money by manufacturing convalescent plasma to give to the very sick than by preventing that sickness in the first place.

The deep state wants Biden to be elected so they are not ordering the drug companies to manufacture the gamma globulin.  So our economy will be destroyed and many many people will die."

Cities need to be addressing that over learning fractions on time. Spread kids out in the gymnasium. Put them down one side of the hallway.

""Fake It Til You Make It"" doesnt work for societal strife.
Think of the prospect of six children becoming sick at the same time, in a classroom with one teacher and possibly no accessible nurse! Who would they tend to first? In some cases a school nurse can't even touch the child until they've called the parent on the phone first, due to the onerous and redundant American Beauracracy. None of these scenarios are conducive to a safe school reopening. and I really would like to see the  writeups of updated insurance liability clauses for all of these re openings of businesses, parks and schools, restaurants, etc. Now children are at stake, politics be danged, common sense must rule now."

It is crazy that the teachers unions are going to hold the entire us economy hostage. And the democrats care more about the unions than the welfare of the kids, obviously.

Usually the Times is refreshingly honest, but this article misses the reality by miles. As other commentators have already pointed out, the school year is about to begin. It’s already lost. Yes, school officials have been working extremely hard to figure out potential options for reopening, but if they have any sense of reality, they have probably already concluded that it is virtually impossible in this country to safely open the schools without directly leading to intense spikes in infections, deaths, and the decimation of the teaching population / the families who send their kids to school. We also really don’t know what the long-term physical effects of this disease will be on adults and, yes, children. The howling desperation from parents and the Trump administration to force schools to reopen is at its best, delusional, and at its worst, extremely shortsighted and cynical.

We cannot ignore the social, emotional and academic development of our children.  Computers cannot replace in-person education and should only be an adjunct to some days in school--if the infection rate is under control.

 There have been multiple studies that show that children do not appear to be transmitting the virus nor do they become very ill when they get it, except in very rare cases.  There is always risk but the risk to our children's overall development is greater if they do not go back to school.

I am a teacher and a full-time custodian of an 8 yr old grandson.  We will we are our masks, practice social distance and educate our children."
2020-07-12 12:58:34,"It's time governments admitted and the general population realized the very high probability that this virus is not going away and a viable vaccine in the required quantities is a decade away if even possible. We need real leaders in government who are not already heavily invested in the way we used to do things. The world has changed drastically in the last few months, adapt or die."
2020-07-11 17:01:03,"The key to reopening schools is to get the virus under control--the U.S. has so far failed to do this. If we're serious about reopening schools we need to get serious about masks and social distancing and quarantining and hand-washing and contact-tracing. Some areas have done a decent job of controlling the virus, but most have not."
2020-07-12 16:58:02,"There are two things that have become abundantly clear since this pandemic hit the United States. One, that public schools in the U.S. are undervalued.  For years, we have ignored recommendations of class sizes and allowed classes to be overflowing with kids.  Teachers are expected to perform miracles with little to no resources, inadequate support from administration, and facing tremendous adversity and negativity from the general population.  We need to take a serious look at how we value the education of our children and take the steps to back this up.  Lower class sizes, hire more support staff, pay teachers appropriately for what they do, cut back on standardized testing, properly fund special education programs, etc.  No one seems to realize that we have been failing our children for years.   Two, that the incompetence of our government leaders to proactively deal with the pandemic.  If appropriate measures had been taken from the very beginning, we may not be having this discussion right now.  After 6 months of this, we should have enough testing.  There should be more than enough protective equipment for everyone (if the hospitals can't even do this, why should we expect this in the schools?)  We don't have this, nor do we have a leader who feels any kind of empathy for those who are suffering or have died."
2020-07-12 17:05:05,"The law of large numbers will make for something bad-

With tens of thousands of schools opening - some number of them will be outliers-  

There will be some schools where nobody gets sick everything seems to work-

But then there will be the schools on the other end- where too many kids and teachers are getting sick and some dying- in numbers that will surprise.  We know this will happen - we can't just Magical Thinking it away.
 
I am sad and worried for those schools."
2020-07-12 17:06:31,"I live in NJ, one of the few states that seem to have things under control, at least for now.  In our community, kids are still socializing either in their own pods of friends, or as always, through their phones.  I don’t think missing the additional socialization provided by schools is an issue we should be concerned with right now.

We should have a major push to go to on-line learning.  Kids that don’t have internet access or laptops should be given them, either by their school district or federal program - it will be much cheaper overall than the unsustainable, or plainly undoable approaches to get kids physically back in school.  ISP’s should be required to provide their services at cost.

Online learning can work for most kids, and we should not be deterred from the previous problems we had this spring, where teachers had very little training and preparation, and some families did not take it seriously.  These are fixable issues once online courses become the norm.  And kids who didn’t have access before will greatly benefit too.

Elementary school kids will need to have an adult presence, so their solution will look different.  We could, for instance, strictly isolate classes and do constant pool testing - a positive test sends everyone home for two weeks.  Far from ideal, but workable, and it would prevent outbreaks from shutting down whole schools."
2020-07-12 17:09:16,"It’s not complicated. Test everyone, isolate the infected, the others go about business as usual. Everyone needs to be tested at the same time, or very close. Mobilize the military for the testing. And everyone else. Cops, firemen. Test the entire country in one weekend. Starting up anything under present conditions is not gonna end well."
2020-07-12 17:11:56,"So, one sentence about the challenge the US faces with an out-of-control virus and then studies from other countries who have ""opened"" in ways that don't sound anything like what Trump has proposed.
As I posted a few days ago on another site -
The US has roughly 4 times Germany's population 
If we had 4 times Germany's COVID numbers, July 1st to 7th - 
we would have had 204 deaths instead of 3,887 
we would have had 10, 092 new cases instead of 370,361

If we were steady at about 200 deaths nationwide in a week, we wouldn't be having the same debate about sending kids back to school."
2020-07-12 17:17:04,"Water.  In the years when I spent a lot of time in classrooms in various cities I started to focus on children's access to water in their classrooms.  Children get a lot of viruses and need to wash their hands.  When ill, and they do come to school ill, they need to be able to freely drink water to get well.
Most classrooms lack access to handwashing and drinking water.  
Please, use this crisis to establish basic water access in classrooms.  It would improve health outcomes."
2020-07-12 17:18:30,"An entire generation of kids will be under-schooled, as  a result of schools not opening.   This is the risk folks.  I know first hand, as the parent of an 8 year old, who has not embraced online learning, nor did he “learn” very much, as a result.  He was an exceptional student before the pandemic.  Once schools shut down, his love of learning dissipated and he became incredibly anxious.  He missed his friends.  He missed the entire school atmosphere.  His teacher would drive by our house and wave, which only made him more upset.   

My viewpoint may be anecdotal, but it’s my personal opinion.  I understand the concerns teachers have and am more than sympathetic to them; yet, psychologists, sociologists and people way smarter than me, will be studying the downstream effects of prohibiting children from in-person schooling.  

 In my humble opinion, online learning is an inadequate substitute for in-person, social instruction, especially for elementary school children. 

I don’t know the answer here.  However, before you run off and declare, “close all schools,” think about what it is doing to our children.   More over, think of what it does to parents, who see their children sink further into isolation.  

Again, there is no easy answer."
2020-07-12 17:19:14,"It seems any discussion of school reopening must be focused on local data and information. The number of cases and rate of spread varies significantly between and within states. There may be some counties in some states that can consider safely reopening schools based on covid rates while in other areas, it is not safe currently to do so. I think it is important to pinpoint those places that have strong handle on covid and explore reopening. The country is not a monolith in terms of covid and school planning needs to reject this."
2020-07-12 17:20:33,"Schools should be reopened without a doubt - but, only if the following measures would happen to address health and safety concerns: the Federal government should coordinate with the states on acquisition and distribution of required PPEs particularly to colleges, universities and schools; the Federal government should provide emergency capital funding to schools for required partitions, hand sanitizing stations etc. and other protective equipment; and the Federal government steps in to coordinate all components and supplies necessary to provide accurate and reliable testing in all states.  These are just some necessary Federal actions needed to get schools and general everyday life up and running.  Neither POTUS nor DeVoss has stated any of these prerequisites in their careless threats and exhortations to resume."
2020-07-12 17:23:27,"In a community right now with exponentially rising cases of Coronavirus I think this needs to be addressed on the local level. We are being given a choice to send our kids to school in person or opt for online learning. Teaches are not being given that choice. Parents  who are already sending their kids to daycare obviously will opt for in person school. Essential workers, healthcare workers, many low income families. As a specialist MD myself opting to treat patients via telemedicine I have been so thankful for the option technology gives us to adapt. I’m going to opt for on line learning. Do I think it is going to be perfect? No, but my kids have learnt a lot on their own this summer. They are learning Spanish, writing books. Maybe we need to look at safety first, who cares about everything else if you are dead or very ill? And maybe we need to adapt as a society, utilize technology as well as science.  Viruses are very smart especially this one. People can’t behave stupidly. It’s simple evolutionary principles. So while it’s a complex question I think it deserves a complex answer- let’s look at local transmission rates, individual family needs/ risk levels, for students, families and teachers/ admistrators. And let’s also try to adapt to do things differently. Our education system and healthcare system were lagging prior to all this. I think we could adapt at least some of our schools to streamline what really needs to be learnt, allowing kids greater creativity."
2020-07-12 17:33:16,"In Canada, Quebec has decided to reopen schools this fall with various “social distancing measures in place.” With that, for sure infections will spike, teachers and kids will spread the virus, and the cycle will continue. The question will soon become, not, “should we return to school this fall,” but, “how much collateral damage are we willing to tolerate as a society?” As a parent, the thought of endangering teacher’s lives for my child’s education makes me sick to my stomach."
2020-07-12 17:34:03,"This could be handled much better if the following had not happened over the years
1. Cutbacks for cleaning staff and cleaning supplies and equipment 
2. Building schools with poor ventilation 
3. Cramming ever larger numbers of students into smaller classrooms
4. Getting rid of school nurses"
2020-07-12 17:39:46,"People keep referencing the racial and economic inequity produced by distance learning which is valid and real. But what about the racial and economic inequity produced by sending students in neighborhoods that are predominately Black or Latinx, populations disproportionally hit by Covid19, to virus breeding grounds? These are the two options we have to compare and it's horrible but the lesser of two evils is a distanced education as opposed to these families paying with their health and lives. The United States is not even close to adequately addressing the spread of the virus and they have for YEARS continued to defund public education. It is not on educators' backs to fix this. Maybe this will be the wake up call the government needs to invest in schools, but I'm not feeling too hopeful."
2020-07-12 17:46:44,"Science cannot teach us anything if we do not want to learn from it or if we want to learn selectively what is convenient to learn. The same goes with reopening schools. If we do not want to take safety precautions and have everyone uniformly follow the guidelines just like the school uniforms of a bygone era we are destined to fail and infections continue to spread like wild fire. 

There is not a cookie cutter approach or one size fits all for every school reopening. A careful thought process has to result in meticulously executing the sanitary requirements appropriate for every student, teacher and staff member. There is a risk involved in carelessly reopening and a proper risk benefit analysis needs to be done in every school. While children may not be considered as a vulnerable population with regard to Coronavirus COVID-19, they could be carriers to their vulnerable parents and grand parents making containment of spread and reducing deaths near impossible. Then there has to be special consideration given to special needs children who may have behavior issues, juvenile diabetes, autism, genetic immunodeficiency etc. Certainly the challenges to reopening will place an additional burden to already hard pressed schools with children that have minimal parent supervision."
2020-07-12 17:50:22,"Education administrators that I know in PA are working very hard to figure this out. Our PA Dept. of Ed is with them at every step. Perfection? No. But we are trudging through.
A common plan in a district:
2 days on for half of the students, middle day online ed for all (cleaning day), 2 days on for the other half. Masks, distancing and shields will be the norm and hopefully followed well enough.
Plus, in the same district, there will be some students online 100% and ""online"" teachers"" to support them due to health concerns.  Special education is probably the hardest to adapt, which is terribly hard to acknowledge.
As a career educator - I trust our school admins and staff more than I trust the failing Federal leadership.  
Teachers don't go into this profession to be famous, powerful or rich. We go into it to teach and support the well being of all children. I trust that. Most admins are first teachers.
I think it helps for everyone to keep this in mind and trust that we are all doing our best. No one has ""the answer"". We have some data, not enough, and so we build the year as we face it - responsibly and compassionately."
2020-07-12 18:00:25,The schools will open without any rational efforts to control the spread of the pandemic because we have not the means to identify who might be temporarily isolated to do so. The total shutdown strategy has been conducted without thought and it is threatening our society with anarchy as it condemns a huge proportion of our people to great impoverishment. So  the children will have to go back to school.
2020-07-12 18:08:06,"I think the idea of opening school when we as a nation are experiencing a rise in cases not a decline is frankly, very scary and unwise.  There is no simple answer, but as a school teacher who is older I am very worried for both myself, my husband and my students. I am anticipating zero support from our government or the department of education.   I wonder who is advising our district from the medical community?  I wonder what supports systems will be in place and who will pay for them? Once again educators will have to 'MacGyver' a solution, out of their own pockets."
2020-07-12 18:10:31,"Secretary De Vos once more represents a real problem according to right wing reactionary priorities, that is the wealth of themselves is more important to preserve for society than the lives of anyone else. This attitude is founded upon a presumption that the overall all condition of human life is scarcity and existential struggle for survival between all people. To live, others must perish, to have the benefits of civilization, many more people must perish. It is a destructive denial of what people working together have always accomplished since humans formed cooperative groups."
2020-07-12 18:23:51,"The analytics certainly do not support the Times' pressure to reopen schools.  Reporting from other countries with a tiny fraction of the number of cases are not persuasive given that Florida just announced 15,200 new cases in one day.  More than 7,000 children have tested positive for COVID 19 in Florida.

The Times also published the CDC's report on schools and colleges as high risk environments.  Crowded classrooms and hallways for several hours every day for five days, lacking proper HVAC, spaces designed to accommodate larger numbers of students including in hallways, restrooms, lack of adequate resources anyway, are all negatives.

The health of teachers, staff members, and students should also be considered, and many would fall into vulnerable categories.

Something is seriously wrong when science and medicine are not the primary factors being considered and when false analogies are being drawn."
2020-07-12 18:27:21,"All countries that re-opened school successfully did so after they have contained the virus spread. Most of them have mask requirements, and social distancing is the norm. 

Schools in Thailand, for example, have modified schedules that staggers the student population to accommodate social distancing. Barriers were put in place to phycially separate children when in classes. Most have turned off their air conditioners for better ventilation, and minimize the chance of airborne transmission. Yes, students and teachers also wear masks.

What is our plan? To simply rush to re-open schools in the midst of escalating transmission without any plan and measures in place is just suicidal for the parents. We've rushed to open states before and look at the results."
2020-07-12 18:37:46,"In July, < 2 months before schools would reopen, the virus is spreading far more rapidly than it was in March when they closed.     

That springtime spirit of ""we are all in this together"" is reduced to an advertising slogan and not driving any sensible policy on health, economics or food security, much less education."
2020-07-12 18:45:17,"I don't know, maybe the administration is taking this opportunity to steer families to private schools and homeschooling by highlighting public school teachers' reluctance to go back to the classroom.  As a parent, I have no issues with distance learning as long as it is bell-to-bell live instruction, but I doubt that will happen in this school district."
2020-07-12 18:52:17,"In the spring when SC schools went to remote learning, we had a hundred or so infections.  Now, we have 1500+ new cases every day, yet SC is talking about opening schools. There is not even a state mandate to wear masks.  

This morning on CNN, Betsy DeVos had no plan to help schools with social distancing or other issues.  

Everyone wants children to get a good education.  Education is better in person.  But at what cost to children and their families?  What about disabled children who may be more vulnerable to the virus? What if grandparents live with or take care of children so their parents can work?  What about older teachers or those with health issues? 

SC is not equipped to open schools and neither are many states and counties throughout the country.  Opening in the middle of a pandemic is unwise, especially in areas where the numbers of cases rise daily.  There has to be a better way.  Educators should find it."
2020-07-12 19:06:46,"Is it worth considering ""kids in classrooms"" is a red herring, and Trump's aim is to get parents back in jobs in commercial real estate buildings? After all, that is his business. Commercial spaces like offices, hospitality, and brick-and-mortar stores have taken a hit from the pandemic. Getting workers' bodies in front of computers and behind cash registers would help Trump personally, and his billionaire developer supporters, too numerous to name."
2020-07-12 19:12:55,"Perhaps the pandemic can provide and opportunity for our nation to reimagine traditional schooling. As I listen to the argument to reopen school buildings, the list of reasons given include daycare so that parents can return to work, social-emotional well-being of children, school breakfasts and lunch, with education often not making the top of the list. Perhaps schools are expected to do too much which is analogous to the recent debate of defunding and narrowing the focus of policing. Could this be an opportunity to reimagine education? Might we find ways to improve the remote learning option which ultimately could provide tremendous cost-savings. For parents who need to return to work and rely on schools for daycare, perhaps proctors could be utilized to monitor remote learning for smaller groups of students. Another year of remote learning while we explore less expensive, safer options for delivering instruction might allow us as a nation to revolutionize how we deliver effective education in more economical ways."
2020-07-12 19:33:48,"Interesting. I keep reading articles about reopening schools. It's difficult to find the perspectives of the front line workers - the teachers. We don't pay teachers enough or give them enough resources. If I were a teacher, I'd be reluctant to get back in a classroom."
2020-07-12 16:59:43,"How to reopen Schools:
1.  Ignore everything Donald Trump & Betsy DeVos say.
2.  Ignore everything all GOP Governors say.
3.  Listen to Dr. Fauci & other renowned virologists' guidelines.
4.  Listen to your school boards, unless the are Republican.

Be particularly wary if you are poor, or if live in a minority community, where the GOP can do particular harm by recommending no masks and no social distancing when sending children to schools."
2020-07-12 17:00:25,"Trump's path to victory is to ramp up the rate of infection and death, so that he can get reelected in the ensuing chaos. Opening schools prematurely is a perfect way to do so."
2020-07-12 17:02:34,What other nations that have been successful should have taught us is : first deal with the pandemic. As a nation we have  only dealt with the pandemic in relation to how this or that approach  might affect Trump's re election.  Secretary Devos has suggested that only a small percentage of children will die  because of a pre election reopening. Of  course a small percentage of a large number  represents thousands of kids. That she has an idea of the number  is the  thing which  separates  Devos and our president from Stephan Paddock.When he went up in the Mandaly Hotel he could not have known how many he was going to kill.
2020-07-12 17:08:25,"The people pushing hard, complete with threats and finger-pointing, to rush to open schools (trump & Co, along with  their fanatical minions) are the same people who merely shrug their shoulders every time there’s a school shooting. 

To them, AK-47 or Covid-19, it’s all the same. Children, teachers, and staff at public schools are simply collateral damage in service of their agenda: universal access to any and all weapons for everyone, or a desperate act to “save” the economy."
2020-07-12 18:18:39,There is an incorrect assumption underlying all this debate. That is the assumption that DeVos is acting in good faith. Unfortunately that is doubtful. She is about to achieve her goal of closing public schools and shifting the money to christian church schools. The forced reopening of public schools in communities where the viral load in the community is too high is doomed and will fail due to outbreaks inside the schools. For DeVos this is a feature not a bug.
2020-07-12 19:32:26,"Our private school in Seattle is planning to open on schedule with a myriad of protocols in place. On the surface of things it seems like the best possible plan any school could come up with. 

And then I talked another parent from our class who is currently SIP with her family in Texas. They plan to leave Texas and travel to Florida for August. So that means that a kid coming into my daughter’s class will have been in 2 states experiencing a horrible spikes in cases just before school starts. 

It shows one glaring problem with the plan: without mandatory 2 -week self-quarantine for families at the school, all the protocols may not mean a fig."
2020-07-12 17:25:00,"It's clear that we can't be confident that we can't ""safely"" get the kids back to school, with the virus out of control on a large proportion of the US. 

If we're serious about getting kids back to school, and getting back to work, and SAFELY, then CLEARLY we need to make getting COVID-19 under good control JOB ONE. 

But just as clearly, given the lack of any meaningful national policy and ""50 shades of relative chaos"" at the state level, that goal isn't anything remotely approaching job one in the US. 

So there you have it.  Oh, and the virus won't be impacted by wishful thinking, hand wringing, etc."
2020-07-12 17:49:20,"Wait, of course it is safe to open schools in countries with .001% of America's infection rate.  It is not safe to open schools when the American infection rate is high.  It is a shame that the NY Times is comparing very different circumstances.  

Americans schools are very different than schools in Europe.  Our schools are underfunded and overcrowded.  American schools were not clean before the pandemic, and will not be clean during any opening.  American parents see schools differently.  An American parent has no problem giving a child an aspirin before school to hide an illness--Temperature checks are all but useless. 

American doctors and nurses can't get PPE, so teachers/students will not have access to these supplies either.

America has the resources to contain this epidemic.  If Republicans stopped fighting against federal being involved in this epidemic, we could easily contain it.  Republicans also fight against a national mandate to wear masks, a national testing system, and a national contact tracing system.  Republicans have fought against boosting PPE.  Right now, the Republican senate is on vacation for the express reason to block any federal interventions to this epidemic.

The sooner we remove Republicans from office, the sooner we will be able to contain this epidemic and safely open schools.  Biden and a Democrat controlled senate will contain this epidemic in a month."
2020-07-12 19:22:29,Donald Trump did NOTHING to control its spread & now wants schools to reopen without reasonable guidelines or federal government assistance. He wants to put students & teachers at risk to benefit his reelection campaign.
2020-07-12 18:35:17,We've seen multiple examples of Covid running through summer camps and large numbers of kids getting infected quickly.  I don't think there is really much chance that young kids won't spread the disease readily if given the chance.
2020-07-12 17:50:55,"The schools cannot reopen in most of the country because the virus is not contained. DeVos and Trump can harrumph and threaten all they want to no avail. The federal government spends 8.5% of the federal budget on public (and now religious?) schools vs. 54% for the military(nationalpriorities.org); Congress has already allocated the money Trump claims to hold up; Republicans under Mitch McConnell refuse to sign the latest iteration of the CARES Act, so how will schools even fund the building upgrades to HVAC systems, PPE, sanitizers, specialized desks, technology, extra staff plus substitutes not to mention all the planning needed with teacher force working on this and no clear plans for how to return safely? What if we go back and when the Flu season arrives cases spike as the CDC and WHO predict? Do we close and reopen like tuna cans? Really, it's all on the states and each locality, because Trump Republicans can face reality and can't plan. They are anti-government when we really need those that can govern and have empathy for other humans. What schools will need to do is hire many multi-lingual social workers so they can connect the unconnected to the technology, food, and housing they need. Schools need to work on making Zoom school better until we have a vaccine and can go back to school! How will this happen the first week of school? How is being stuck in a desk better than being in front of a computer?"
2020-07-12 18:27:17,"Imagine the frontline professionals refused to go into work back in April and May because they were too scared. Imagine hospitals with no doctors and nurses. No groceries and no package deliveries. It would have been the end of the world as we knew it. I think educational professionals are on the frontline being tested for their resillience. Without schools, we will fall into the darkest abyss. So yes, we are selfishly asking for your martyrdom and extraordinary sacrifice so we can get back on our feet. Our country is crippled and rudderless without any signs of hope. We need our teachers to guide our children and parents so we can rebuild our communities from ground up."
2020-07-12 18:05:01,"If we reopen schools before a significant percentage of US population is vaccinated, a lot of children and many more teachers will die.

But, then, the Republicans do not care. Judging by their reaction after every school schooting, they love guns more than children.

So, from a Republican perspective, as long as guns do not die of COVID19, the schools can be opened safely.

That is the world we are living in. These are the people we are dealing with.

So be it."
2020-07-12 20:12:15,"There is a sequence every other country has followed:

1. Get COVID-19 under control
2. Re-open schools

No other state has gone to step 2 without first doing step 1. There isn't any model anywhere else.

And you can't screen children for COVID-19, because many who are infected show little or no symptoms, so in an outbreak you have to treat each child as being infected. And from what we know, children do spread COVID-19."
2020-07-12 20:27:59,"The problem with so much of US thinking and policy is that there is an idea that schools can solve America's problems. We depend on schools to do too much without funding them properly or treating our teachers fairly. It's so hard to use countries like Denmark, Sweden, Germany or Japan as examples when they START from a place where education is valued, kids are taken care of, and families are supported. My nephew is in Germany. They only started back to full-time school once their state (not district or county but state-equivalent) had NO MORE CASES. 

Sending kids to school won't magically make the coronavirus go away. We need to invest in the health of our society, get the cases down everywhere, then think about how to re-open schools responsibly. Believe me, I want our kids back to school, but I cringe at the comparison with other nations. It's false. Our education systems don't work like theirs. Our leaders haven't confronted the virus seriously like theirs."
2020-07-12 20:30:40,"In person learning will continually be shut down for many students as cases pop up within a school. Anyone with symptoms or exposed to a confirmed or suspected case will have to quarantine. I don’t see how there will be a way to avoid chaotic rolling shutdowns and quarantines, and repeated testing of children (with the highly uncomfortable nasal swabs and wait time for results). Entire schools or classes may also have to shut down and return to the madness of last minute remote learning. 

Aside from the obvious health concerns for all (and yes, that includes children!), this is worrisome.  It doesn’t make sense to open schools in areas where the virus is still widespread.  

And this is not to ignore the needs of households where all parents need to work, nor those that don’t have the resources or skills to effectively utilize remote learning. That is a tremendous societal problem on top of everything else."
2020-07-12 20:51:57,"Those in charge of making decisions on how to conduct school programs this fall should make public their plans, including contingencies, monitoring and the resources (space, personnel and money) to do the job properly, WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START DATE.

This will give parents, teachers, disease care professionals and other stakeholders the opportunity to point out flaws and make decisions about opting in or out (in the case of parents, teachers and other school staff)."
2020-07-12 21:04:04,"There is NO TOP DOWN MANDATE for  Staying Safe
from Covid-19;  

Our schools are not laboratories for determining safety for
students or teachers or school administrative personnel.
It is not safe to open schools until all who attend public schools have received the Coronavirus vaccine.

There is no national plan from our Federal Government/
our Executive Branch to mandate safety from the Coronavirus.  The virus has run rampant in states which
have not mandated wearing PPE and Stay at Home Orders."
2020-07-12 21:23:15,"One other thing to keep in mind is that schools in many foreign countries are smaller--often much smaller--than American schools. Instead of windowless bunkers with 2000+ students, we're talking about a few hundred students at the most, in smaller buildings where the classrooms almost always have windows.

2020-07-12 21:23:35,"Should we be waiting for a vaccine until cows come home when children can be immunized and schools can reopen? No. We need to do all it will take to keep schools safe and well educated. The pandemic should become a teaching moment from a very young age on head to toe hygienic practices. Normally, parents are the first teachers of hygiene and self care but that was a different generation of parents. Schools of the current school going children have a very different curriculum and are not adequately taught lifestyle relevant science. Hygiene, nutrition and Microbiology should be taught before a child leaves high school. 

Before the current Coronavirus pandemic is driven out from earth there could be another that could cause similar panic if we are unprepared. 99.9% of the world population will be still around after this pandemic. If we do not want humans to serve as fodder to infectious agents we have to do all it takes to translate basic science to prevent and ward off infections. Unfortunately even though we were empowered to just that we the people of the USA, not all,  have failed to control the virus or get ourselves out of the line of fire of the virus. It no longer bothers me that the virus has the upper hand.

This is the ""mushy"" language of political bureaucrats who want to please their bosses instead of telling the truth.  It's language that can be disavowed if disaster strikes, as in ""I never actually SAID that.""

Non-surgical face masks, ""social distancing,"" staggered class days, and hybrid instruction strike me as effective and scientific as those old ""duck and cover"" films from the early days of the Cold War.  The U.S. has seen 3,271,549 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 134,904 deaths from Covid-19...since February.  Barely six months.  More than 60,000 NEW cases in the U.S. were reported this past Tuesday.  We've had the biological equivalent of a nuclear bomb dropped on the U.S., and our leaders (including Der Trumpenfuhrer) are acting as if it's no big deal.  Send your kids back to school, and pay no attention when they start dropping like flies.  Collateral damage, ya know?

Betsy DeVos is on record as saying that only 0.02% of children in America will die from Covid-19 when they go back to school.  Do the math.  That means 14,470 dead kids.  Ah,  it's so EASY to accept casualties when YOUR kid isn't one of them.

We have a crazy Florida governor who wants schools to reopen in six weeks. Really? With spikes of more than 15,000 infected DAILY? Surely this country is on its way to crash and burn. 

Stay home. Wear the mask outdoors only for essential trips. And remote learn. Students without WiFi still can get books and paper delivered. It has been done already.

2020-07-12 16:57:24,"I live in San Diego County. Amazing weather here, almost year round. Districts around the country are clearly being left on their own regarding how to safely open schools. There is absolutely NO cohesive plan at the Federal level, as we are tragically being ""led"" by an evil idiot. 

So, one idea for many districts in  California is to temporarily redesign our school's outdoor spaces to accommodate students. Most schools already have picnic benches outside for lunch, snack and recess. Many also have outdoor amphitheaters for assemblies/special events. Tented areas and partitions can be set up in around the campus.  Bathrooms would be sanitized throughout the day. Small libraries with tech stations can be set up outside. A few indoor spaces can be safely used for administration including the nurse. School hours can be staggered so the schools aren't inundated with students in every grade. Schools can creatively use these spaces, on a rotating basis for a few months, as we work toward flattening the curve(s) again and have a vaccination. 
This is not an ideal solution. For example, special education services are particularly challenging given the wide and varied individual differences/needs of these students,( typically developing children also have individual needs, also in need of discussion), But, with some ingenuity, creativity  and available funding, some school districts can use their natural environments to welcome their students and teachers as safely as possible."

How come sports organizations are able to test daily their employees, for example Formula 1, while schools barely have enough money for pencils?

As usual, the priority is money.
The Catholic Church stole $1.6 billion dollars from the PPP program.
That money could've been used to daily test students and school staff.

American schools are ending up with useless, paper based on the surface protocols that make people ""feel"" safe but they aren't.  
In my school district they even sent a survey to parents and staff to see how they ""feel"" about returning to face-to-face instruction.  They didn't show the results but said that 80% of parents wanted face to face instruction. 

Idiotic, who doesn't want that?

Like if the virus spread depended on our gut feelings or preferences.
The only way to control this is through Science.
And that costs money.
And we don't want to waste our money in people life's.
If we would, we would keep the online learning until the Science is clear, we have a vaccine and an effective treatment for the virus.

But is not going to happen because schools are sought more like a daycare.  
Corporation leaders and governments want schools open ASAP so their employees don't have an excuse to miss more work.  The faster people die, the sooner it will be forgotten.

But bringing back schools at full capacity would guarantee spreading of the COVID-19 virus.  Another factor is that as adults, teachers will be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus than their students for the most part, except for the very few students with compromised immune systems.  Handled the wrong way--the ignorant, dumb, stupid Trump way, by just stuffing everyone back into the building only to watch them sicken and die, is a non-starter.  alternating days of attendance for in person classes versus online classes daily, would decrease the probability of the virus infecting more children.  It is foreseeable that adult staff will be more vulnerable than the children.  That presents a very difficult set of problems.  Schools can barely keep sufficient teachers on staff.  If a significant percentage of teachers, especially those who are seniors or with underlying medical conditions, the rates at which such persons would become severely ill would be significant.  With no pool of teachers waiting to supplement those who become ill, the back-to-school in person model is not sustainable.  Online instruction is the most viable option, though it is severely restricting socially.  Once vaccines become available, the problem will be decreased.  Until the next novel virus spreads around the planet, dwarfing all our other problems."

Every school, business, medical clinic, hospital and other institution in America needs to learn this lesson and stop listening to ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that oozes out of the White House.

If she does not go in, who do they get for a substitute? In the Before Time, people like me (retired teachers) made up a huge percentage of the subs. But at 64, am I going to be willing to take a sub job? What if she needs a sub for two or more weeks? A long term sub job used to appeal to many who work as subs. Now? Even in the BT, subs were in high demand and short supply. 

Do districts start deputizing anyone with a BA (or high school diploma - teaching ain’t that hard!) off the streets to sub? Huh. Any idea how long it takes to do a background check, in normal times, for someone, even a parent volunteer, to be in the classroom, even with the teacher present? Do you want just anyone, alone, in the room with your child, without having been vetted by the DOJ?

So we need to stay healthy.  
Honestly, if we lived in a nation that had some real leadership, where we were treating this virus as something to be defeated together instead of a yet another political wedge, then I might trust that the guidance about opening schools is trustworthy.  I might then feel like the health of my teacher friends was in good hands, and that my kids would be guided through doing school in new and different ways with lots of community support.

One reason not mentioned: younger students often spend most of the day with a single classroom of students and a single teacher.  And there isn’t nearly as much passing in the halls.

So-called ""COVID hospitalizations"" and ""COVID deaths"" do not speak at all to the danger of the virus because those counts are being tallied simply because of a positive test regardless of other health health issues that may have actually CAUSED the hospitalization or death. If we were to start testing everyone for strep, and compiling hospitalizations and death counts in the same manner, those numbers would dwarf what is being shown for COVID-19 and would *increase* as more people are tested - not because of growth of transmission. Strep is present at detectable levels in about 20% of the U.S. population with higher percentages in some localized populations. That is 65.6 million people. As such, hospitalizations and deaths with strep *present* would parallel that population yet bureaucrats don't tell people they cannot work, go out or socialize because or strep.

I don't know what the true mortality rate of COVID-19 is, but it surely is NOT what has been suggested to us using these numbers. If the government won't change to use causally-related counts then it is not public information they're spreading, it is manipulation."

I'm sure the progressives, as usual, just want to give the bottom half more money than they've ever made and keep schools closed, until Nov.?

In the mean time, the author claims that other countries opened schools up this Spring 'after locking down' for a few weeks.  They claim that there has been no 'surge' in infections.  But, I guarantee that the NYTimes will be publishing every child that is positive while claiming that more minority children are affected because of racism and 'income inequality' - there will be an article every day on this topic for any school that reopens in the country.  It will be Trump's fault.

And, if schools don't open, they will claim that kids aren't getting fed (the responsibility now of the school system) and are not getting educated because the Internet isn't available to minorities and it's all about white privileged.

The virus is out of control in large part due to the disparate responses we have had across the US; and partly due to the bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach by the federal government and national leaders.  50 different solutions does not an iron-clad virus response make. Countries that are controlling the virus and earned the right to open schools have one, unified plan and approach to the virus and transmission, and paid the price to open schools.

At this late date, wouldn’t it make more sense to shut the economy down again to bring the curves down to acceptable levels and then open both schools and the economy?

We absolutely need one, unified plan driven by our health experts. All we need the politicians for is to open the purses to ensure funding to defeat this virus. This would give us the time and the will to properly plan for school and work safety, and improve the chances for teachers and children to stay healthy and alive.

The current path we are on is to stay the course, open schools and businesses, and watch the second wave, nay the tsunami, sweep across the US with literally millions becoming infected and possibly millions dying. Why wait until January and a change in administration to do it correctly?

But not one has asked about a hazardous duty pay increase. Instead, they ask who is buying the cleaning supplies? Who is doing the cleaning between cohorts? Who is monitoring, and with what equipment?

How are they to trust, when teachers payout hundreds of dollars for essential supplies to simply do their job every single year, that critical cleaning supplies, personnel, and correct procedures (followed to the letter) will be there from Day 1 for them? 

It is disheartening to read the many disparaging remarks about the “selfishness” of teachers in articles and comments. These people obviously have never been a teacher and do not know what they are talking about."

2020-07-18 08:28:39,"There seems to be a consensus that kids need to go to school, if not they lose out, get behind, etc.

What has been happening to the children being home schooled in the US in the last few decades?

From  anecdotal observation, ""home school is no school"" for  some, possibly many of these children.  Is there any information about this?  Duration of no school, which so far is months in the Covid   experience  versus  the longer term home schooling (years) might be important. 

Perhaps college graduation rates would be one way to detect differences between those getting classroom schooling, and  home schooling whether by parental choice or  now the Covid effects. 

 I suspect there are  differences between children ""missing out""  on school relatively briefly, and longer time periods."

2020-07-23 12:41:19,"Had we handled the virus properly, reopening schools would be doable. It's not now, and it won't much happen. The negative effects of that will cascade right alongside all the other myriad effects of not handling the virus when we had the shot, and then insisting on mass unemployment according to neoliberal dogma.

The only force that could destroy America is America--at least since WWII. We're well on our way...and with carbon and nukes, two problems from which there is literally no possible recovery, right on the heels of this virus.

We're a failed state. Have been for a long, long time. The virus has just incontrovertibly exposed the rot in our really-existing values from top to bottom. You can't hollow out a society for half a century and expect anything different from what we have now.

Good thing the NYT led the charge in destroying Sanders' campaign, though, and fighting every single progressive effort of the past half-century. Slow clap. 

The funny part is that if the ruling class/oligarchy actually had any kind of competence and could rule semi-efficiently, we'd have an interesting debate set up about democracy -- do we really need it when the Guardians are doing so well for the vast majority?

Yeah, we don't have that set-up: the ruling class can't even protect it's own obvious short-term interests. They're as deluded, selfish, impotent, and lost as most of the rest of us; the effects are just more widespread because of their power."
2020-07-23 13:54:59,"I am a physician at a major academic hospital in California. Our hospital system mandates COVID testing in certain scenarios (eg, patients undergoing surgery). In my community, we know the overall asymptomatic positive COVID rate in the pediatric population has risen from <0.1% to 0.2% in the past 3 months. This means that for an elementary school that houses 500 asymptomatic children, on average only 1 child is COVID positive.

These data are consistent with published results: <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2766924"" target=""_blank"">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2766924</a>

The available evidence indicates the chance of severe COVID illness in an infected child is very low, and the rates of transmission among young children is low. There has been no significant outbreak of community spread related to essential worker daycares remaining open during the pandemic, including ours which has 20 teachers and 150 kids attending daily. Kids play with each other without masks. Parents and kids must undergo daily temperature checks and attest to absence of symptoms at the door.

The data argue that in my region it is safe to open elementary schools without requiring expensive testing or unenforceable mask and social distancing policies. Elementary school children need in-person learning most and pose the least risk to public health. Yet Governor Newsom has forced almost every school to move to 100% distance-learning. This decision is not based on data. It is based on politics and fear of the unknown."
2020-07-23 15:22:36,"As a teacher, what I find so frustrating about articles describing the successful openings of schools in other countries, is the absence of data on infection rates in those countries.

How well does that virus need to be contained to safely reopen schools?  What metric should we be looking at?"

Lots of people are trying to decide whether schools should reopen. Decisions in medicine are never Manichean..""yes"" or ""no""...Nothing is that clear cut in medicine--it is always a question of balancing risks and benefits.

Sometimes benefits are very great and risks are minimal or there is minimal benefit and great risk--the choices are relatively easy. But sometimes the choice is much harder when risks and benefits are difficult to calculate. There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" choice--only a choice.

No easy answers here, but do be aware that whatever choice you make the consequences will be very real."

2020-07-23 18:58:17,"Yesterday, the NYT reported that while young children were less likely to spread the virus, by age 10 their ability to infect others matches adult ability.

Last I checked, in most school districts, 5th grade is an elementary grade level (and sometimes 6, 7 and 8). Elementary schools will be flooded with students who are as efficient disease vectors as adults.

A 5th grade teacher has the same chance to avoid catching Coronavirus as a worker in a meat-packing plant (essentially none in any location with community spread). While 10 year-olds may or may be less susceptible to the virus, and are clearly less likely to have major health consequences, the teachers will be exposed in many classrooms. 

School districts are already cash strapped--and the rush to open does not include any money to ameliorate conditions. The school my daughter teaches in has a long-standing mold problem that is not corrected, so expecting money to correct health issues to appear now seems like magical thinking. 

Our education system will have to adjust to many students losing a year and a half of schooling. The only question is how many children, teachers, and staff will be added to our world's highest Coronavirus death toll before the schools close back down. Kids can and do make up for lost schooling  in many situations already. 

In a few years from now, many high school seniors will be 19 or 20. So be it."
2020-07-23 22:35:12,"""No nation has tried to send children back to school with the virus raging at levels like America’s.""  Well, not exactly true.  The USA is far, far from a monolithic entity.  The rate of infections of covid varies enormously from one region to the next.  My state (MA) is not dissimilar to Lombardy, Italy, in terms of the size of the population and the current baseline levels of daily covid cases.  In other words, it is reasonably under control.  However, while in Lombardy children of all ages, as well as university students, prepare to return to their classrooms in a safe and responsible manner, over here we are dominantly operating in ""remote only"" mode.  I always believed that the US was the ""can do"" nation of the world...I am saddened by both the chaotic, rudderless response to the pandemic delivered by the federal government and the reflexive surrender on the side of local and state governments."
2020-07-24 01:17:38,"Remote classes are better than dangerous classes.  The ability of a student to walk into a school without their temperature being taken is trivial.  Most schools do not have a small finite number of entry control points.  In particular, in most schools, in you arrive about an hour before school starts, the school is open and vastly unsupervised.  One would think the number of school shootings we have endured in the last 10 years would have resulted in control points of entry to review book bags to prevent guns and knives from entering.  This simply has not happened.  So anyone infected with Covid-19 can wander into a school without a temperature being taken if they want to.  Unlike airport security, which is designed to eliminate a problem, school security is designed to deter a problem.  Let's be safe or at least safer then we've been."
2020-07-24 00:54:16,"Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick and die. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study. I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as necessary. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures!"
2020-07-24 02:13:13,"""How to Reopenschool Schools: What Science and other Countries Teach Us""
Currently in the United States the President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are pushing very hard for students to be back in school in the fall. I agree with the President and the Secretary of Education this instance, but only if it is safe. I personally believe that Massachusetts and the New England region of the United States has responded to the Coronavirus outbreak particularly well, compared to other parts of the country. As long as people keep wearing masks and try their best to stay six feet apart until there is a vaccine most likely we will be okay. Which brings me back to schools re-opening. In some parts of the United States right now is safer for kids to go back to school, and if the President and Secretary of Education push places where it is not yet safe to go back to school the Coronavirus cases will just go up and possibly start to gain immunity to children who have been particularly well fighting off the disease and just being ""carriers."" With schools trying their best to re-open many students are wondering will there be a sports season. To me I think it is very unlikely for the United States to have a sports season in high schools. In fact California has already cancelled high school sports and it is just a matter of time before all high school sports have to be canceled for the safety of students and the community. There is still hope but no definite yet."
2020-07-24 03:50:21,"I don't mind if the school takes a long time to reopen, so I hope schools keep taking online classes until the safety is guaranteed. By looking at the current situation, some states have quickly spread the virus even it was calm at first, and some states have shown signs of calming down a little, although the spread of the virus was so fast at first. When the school opens in the US now, it will spread quickly and eventually will not able to control the spread. Whether the spread of the virus is fast or slow in where you live, I hope every school does not reopen until safety is guaranteed."
2020-07-24 05:00:00,Testing is so inadequate that a single positive test in a cohort group would require isolation of the whole group.  Adequate testing could ........... never mind.
2020-07-24 10:04:02,"The murmur of a classroom comes to an abrupt stop, dispelled by the teacher's raps on a board. Notebooks open, pens uncapped — students seamlessly, albeit unhurriedly, refocus their minds to the lesson at hand. A projector beams, gathering attention to a now-lit screen — the faint, yet audible hum of the projector marks my class’s focused inclination to learn. 

A few short months later, my classroom is no longer illuminated by the luster of sun. Now, the classroom is illuminated by the dull brim of a digital screen. My classroom is no longer marked by the characteristic and audible activity of student and staff. Now, the notifications of Zoom and Google Hangouts are insuffice semblances of scant familiarity. 

In my time in quarantine and with virtual learning, I've growingly come to realize some of the stark discrepancies in learning, communicating, and finding normalcy within my daily lives. In turn, I've found myself actively hoping for a  return to school. Yet, as the article states, there comes inherent benefit and risk in doing so. 

As it was pointed out, the varying levels of success with reopening schools in various instances has a pointed difference with the situation at hand in America: ""the (virus raging"" at extreme levels. Reading the article, the poignant worries of transmission and infection are pivotal.

In turn, as I remain uncertain of future schooling and our future as a whole, I find strange solidarity in the uncertainty of the direction of our nation.."
2020-07-24 02:29:45,"Here’s my conversations with my two nieces who each have 2 kids in the 7-10 age range. 

Me: how was the online learning for you and your kids?
Niece #1 (Teacher):  “it was great!  Three of us split the teaching workload so I barely had to do anything. That left me plenty of time to work with mine. Most of the kids I teach weren’t all that interested anyway so I guess it doesn’t matter.”
Niece #2 (Engineer working at home): “it was awful. I’m trying to work and teach them at the same time. The instruction they received was terrible. I don’t know what I’ll do if they don’t go back. I don’t think I was ever this stressed out. They miss their friends and I know one of them is fallling behind but I just don’t have enough time to give them what they need.”

Kids need to go back for so many reasons. Other countries are doing it. The risk is low for kids. At risk teachers shouldn’t go back. Let’s be creative here and do the right thing by our children."

Do what didn't happen with assisted living patients and take them immediately out of harm's way. They can have the year off, or concentrate on distance learning for the children who have underlying conditions and cannot be allowed back in any case. This may be a better way to do distance learning, in smaller pods with one teacher, while lower rusk children can return to classrooms with teachers who are slso less at risk. If you remove the most vulnerable, it turns into a scheduling/distancing oroblem."
2020-07-25 09:30:54,"If your country is run by a person who acts like a flea in a fit with attention deficit disorder then the outlook remains dire.

Unfortunately, half-hearted lockdowns, especially when the President argues against them, don't work and Australia showed Covid-19 can stage comeback from a mere handful of cases.

America needs to fix its leadership problem. 

Whenever groups of people gather in close proximity to each other they create an environment in which Covid-19 can spread aggressively unless good protective measures are in place.

Steady, considered and firm leadership is needed to ban or downscale problematic types of events and behaviours.

The best personally protective measures humanity has available now are wearing face masks; frequent hand washing; physical distancing; keeping your hands away from your face; self-isolation of people with symptoms; careful food hygiene; keeping away from crowds and enclosed spaces; and generally minimising contact with other people.

These must all be used with real personal discipline.

These measures can be backed up by aggressive disinfection and cleaning procedures for shared spaces and maintaining excellent ventilation in enclosed buildings and vehicles.

With these in place perhaps America can tough it out until the British Oxford vaccine is released for use, hopefully in September 2020.

If the vaccines fail, then the lock down America has been ducking may become unavoidable.

Let us hope Covid-19 does not mutate dangerously."

2020-07-23 17:48:23,"American schools are very different from schools in other countries.  

American schools are massively underfunded.  There was no budget for cleaning schools before this pandemic, there is no budget to clean them now.

American schools are overcrowded.  

The Americans view public school very differently than they do in other countries.  An American parent will have no problem giving their child an aspirin and sending them to school.  Viruses spread easily and quickly in American schools because of overcrowding, underfunding, and pervasive culture viewing schools as daycares first.

Most other countries have contained this epidemic, while American transmission rates are going through the roof.  Comparing American school openings to countries that have contained this epidemic is illogical.  

America needs to contain this epidemic before opening its schools-Just like all other countries with leadership.  The path to containing this epidemic is simple:Wear masks, social distance, expand testing, and get PPE to doctors and nurses.  Democrats have been calling for these measures for four months, while Republicans have blocked most of these measures.

Biden and a Democrat run senate will contain this epidemic in a month."
2020-07-28 15:17:30,"We will come to regret the rush to put kids back in school.  Without evidence and some to the contrary, schools districts are opening for political reasons.  This is child abuse..they have no say in the matter.   Trump has successfully muzzled the CDC.  The new guidelines are simply a green light to experiment with kids.  No one can say for sure what the outcomes will be.

As to the damage, kids will suffer from not going to school for a while longer no one knows that either.  We have never been there.  The kids', for the most part, will not be neglected, mistreated, or in any way harmed by not attending in person school.  Kids are resilient. All of a sudden everyone is concerned about school-age children who you have neglected for decades and have cut funding time and time again.  Their short term and long term health is on the line here.  When this blows up, and it will, people need to be punished severely.  The only lesson that kids will receive is that ignorance and hubris are dangerous weapons when it comes to healthcare."

It has taken great sacrifice by all of us and excellent state and local leadership to keep our cases numbers among the lowest in the nation. Therefore we'd rather you didn't imperil us because you just had to have a vacation in the middle of a pandemic.  Sorry to be tart, but it's personal. Mr. Lipton drove right past my house on his way to Beech Cliff."
2020-07-16 22:54:22,"A short visit to an adjacent state to deliver some household goods to a relative resulted in unwanted stay at a roadside motel and exposure to numerous maskless people due to an unexpected car problem.

2020-07-16 22:54:50,"As a former Vermonter who has spent some summer time in Maine, that trip sounded the best to me.  Not only is it a beautiful throw back to simpler times, but the family could not have done it any safer.  Getting your children out of the house and into the fresh air is healthy both mentally and physically for them.
The flip to me was the trip close to my new home.   Staying in an Inn and going on wine tasting trips seems unsafe and unnecessary.  As adults we hopefully have the fortitude and resolve to weather these times by avoiding risky situations, wearing a mask, and drinking our wine in our own home."
2020-07-16 23:37:30,"We spent a week in the Adirondacks in Northern NY— it was a great, relaxed vacation. Spent almost all of our time outside hiking, kayaking, swimming, eating ice cream. Can’t ask for much more. But now I am missing Maine."
2020-07-17 00:25:42,"I've only read the Maine entry so far but I have to say—come on!  How on earth is traveling an hour to tour a national park and visiting a lobster emporium along with ""most other businesses,"" even for curbside pickup, complying with a 14-day quarantine order? I bet the Maine officials who imposed the quarantine would beg to disagree."

Clearly written by the type of people who hand-wring about whether or not it's ethical to fly all the time before ultimately deciding that they can't possibly live without their annual vacation. You'd think maybe a pandemic would stop them, but apparently it's not summer if you don't travel hours to drink wine and be outdoors."
2020-07-17 01:47:40,"My husband John, along with our dear friend ML are just back from five days in Provincetown on Cape Cod.  The three of us have made this trip for the past 9 years so we knew the lay of the land, which beach we liked (herring cove) our hotel (the Provincetown Inn) and even the restaurants where we would feel safe eating outside or ordering in.  P'town has a mandatory Mask rule on the main drag, commercial street, which should be done across the nation.  But in short, we felt safe every step of the way.  We knew the hotel and the layout. We knew that our section of the beach was always sparsely populated even in ""normal"" years.  And we took a cooler full of food for breakfast and lunch, so we never had to go shopping and we only had dinners to deal with.  In short for us, the trip was not only relaxing but it broke some taboos - we will still be very careful and remain safe, but life can go on, even in the age of covid-19.   We plan to go back in August for one more long weekend before the summer ends."
2020-07-16 23:29:54,"This is why pandemic is raging. We did it and continue to do it backwards. We should have worked on opening essentials safely 1st.

2020-07-17 03:20:45,"I am a high school teacher in coastal Maine, and  I found the Searsport story really entitled and distasteful. Your coming here was a selfish act, and your writing a story about it, even more so.  I am sure that the people who rented you a home appreciated the income. But why did you feel it necessary to say, ""No one was enforcing these rules. But we decided to honor them anyway?"" To emphasize how virtuous you are? To signal to others that they can be less responsible?  We have made a lot of sacrifices in this state to keep our COVID numbers low. As a result, we MAY be able to start school in person. But yes, we rely on people to obey the rules, and be responsible. People like you, not only making money on an article about my state, but coyly pointing out that others might be able to enjoy themselves without being so responsible; you are the reason we can't have nice things."

Driving on West Shore Road there is a new home built on two lots that were tear downs and it is out of scale with the general area.  The residents are from New Jersey.  The front door is about 30 feet from the road which can be fairly busy with a 30 MPH speed limit.  And they have the gall to post five signs along the road reminding people to please slow down. - Please slow down.  Please slow down.  Please slow down.  Please slow down.  It annoys me to no end when I drive by.  I honk the horn and would love to send them a letter asking them to return to New Jersey.
2020-07-17 08:17:02,"Wow. The selfishness. It’s a quarantine. It won’t be forever. 

My husband and I have cancelled our yearly 2-week vacation to the same spot in coastal Maine we have been visiting for the last 10 years. Did we want to do that? NO. Are we disappointed and depressed? YES. But this is the right thing to do- the state has asked people to follow these guidelines for the safety of all. It’s called making a sacrifice for your fellow humans. I am amazed by how weak and selfish people are. Ugh."

Question: I am aware that there are states that limit the other states' residents who are allowed in, sans quarantine, but how is this enforced? Are people getting carded at Wendy's?

Do business owners currently say, ""Oh, you're from Florida! Get out of my shop!""

Are people from Arizona forbidden from renting houses in Maine?

Local, regional, and statewide mandates are useless. Even a comprehensive federal mandate (which we all know will  never happen) won't make a difference.  If science and data and logic can't convince people to wear masks, etc., than edicts and laws won't either.

Sad, but true."
2020-07-17 04:33:17,"I thought I’d write about how all these vignettes regarding covid vacations are:

a.) infuriatingly out of touch with the experiences of regular Americans (I could almost here Mrs. Howell in her finishing school accent when I read, “We preferred more exotic destinations: Mexico, India, Japan).

and:

b.) seemingly reckless in spite of the precautions taken by the authors.

I thought I’d write about it, but then I read the other comments and realized my feelings were more eloquently expressed by other readers."
2020-07-17 06:13:38,"Where's the part they speak of wearing masks?  A mask is the best protection.  Washing your hands does nothing if you or the person you meet is breathing virus all around.  Or did I  miss it?  We've just driven from Germany to Portugal.  The Germans wear masks in stores,  and public places mostly, even they don't have much problem, French (I'm French) are stupid and don't wear them much ( it will be required starting next week, the only way to get us to obey). Portuguese had small problem, yet they wear masks in public.  C'mon America, it saves lives, how many  more do you want die??"

Maybe pull out a Thoreau reader and take a gander at his quote, ""It matters not where or how far you travel,--the farther commonly the worse,--but how much alive you are."" Please, for the sake of others, stay home. Is your dwelling really so terrible that you can't stay close to home for a single year? Are you that in need of diversion that can only be offered in far away places? It's not easy, everyone gets that. But this is for the good of all. Maybe we can do something for one another by just staying close to home."

Upon further research, discount codes & special car deal I got the Pay Now down to around $1000. Last Summer Rental including all fees was $398.

2020-07-18 18:15:39,"My sweetheart and I live outside Boston and have been working from home and socially distancing rigorously since early March. We rent the same cottage for two weeks every year in North Truro, on Cape Cod near Provincetown, also in Massachusetts. We did not feel compelled to cancel this year. We brought and wore masks and socially distanced everywhere we went. The restaurants we ate at had socially distanced seating outdoors. Mostly, we shopped in masks at the market and cooked at the cottage. We rode our bikes while socially distancing. We went to the beach and socially distanced. Everything we did felt safe and responsible. We are old enough to be high-risk ourselves, so we didn't want to put ourselves or anyone else at risk, and we didn't. While I'm sure that some people who travel are putting others at risk, that does not automatically mean that responsible travel is completely impossible. It does not automatically mean that every single person who travels is irresponsible, selfish, and bad, regardless of where they travel and what precautions they observe. Blanket generalizations don't add any value to the discussion."

I live alone in a big house four bedroom house filled with my stuff from living abroad the past decade and my frequent travels. I am 5 minutes from a mainly empty beach and I have a yard so I had had mental health outdoor time (and quiet)... After my online classes were finished and final grades entered I headed to family. 

We decided to rent a place on a lake north of Ottawa, but still in Quebec where we were sure not to be “plate shamed” for being from the province with the worst Covid-19 record in Canada (by far!). We packed both cars with groceries for any craving we might have and I took my three teenage nieces and they took the epileptic lab with bad hips. For seven days we kayaked and swam, fished and I introduced my nieces to a 1,000 piece puzzle In a huge lake cabin. In a pre-Covid world they would have been at my brother-in-law’s family home in Toulouse for family weddings and I had planned on visiting friends in Israel and my parents in Northern Alberta. I should be planning my return for a summer semester in Shantou, China and buying maple syrup for gifts and stocking up on Western groceries. Instead I’m stocking up on ethnic food ingredients to begin my 10 hour return journey next week. I’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days, no beach, no grocery store or Cost-Co visits. It’s an easy trade off to me for family time,"

2020-07-18 13:23:59,"I think something folks need to understand is that a lot of these places that are becoming “social distance vacation” destinations are often times rural places with limited hospital resources. That being said, what happens if you unknowingly bring Covid with you on your journey, even if you’ve been taking precautions, and suddenly fall ill and require hospitalization? Or what if you visit a national park and accidentally injure yourself? People live in rural places—-they aren’t just wide expanses of empty land—-and they need healthcare too. Rural hospitals are already stretched thin and do not need the additional load from a bunch of people traveling from out of state or from more populated areas who need to get away from it all for a while."

I'm probably going to my mom's house soon for a couple weeks because it's cheaper than a psych ward and I can bring my cat. (I recently almost did something very stupid and very permanent that isn't a neck tattoo...use your imagination. Family decision was made that I'm very not okay to be alone at the moment.) I've been isolating since March, staying mostly home except for groceries and laundry etc., wearing a mask. I plan on following any quarantine rules that Maine has for New Yorkers. 

If you'll be travelling, please do likewise. Even if quarantine rules are not stringently enforced, follow them. If you're taking a bus or a train or a plane, wear your mask.

Do you have any idea how lax the vast majority of Americans have been in comparison to Mr. Lipton? People are eating out at restaurants and going for carry-out all over the place! Going to drive-thrus daily! Grocery shopping every few days! Having friends over! Shopping for fun! Many are doing these things before and after being at jobs where they’re exposed to many people a day. 
In comparison, I’m finding it hard to understand the grave threat in a family, who’ve had very little contact with anyone else for months, driving through your town without getting out of their car and then staying at a house and playing in the yard there. Or in doing contactless pickup (though I personally can’t understand why people pay for restaurant food).  Or walking alone on a trail. They’re not breathing on anyone, and a breeze is all it takes dilute airborne virus to safe levels. 
Demanding that people sit inside their homes for a year is not realistic or sustainable, and it will backfire just as scare-tactic campaigns demanding abstinence backfired during the AIDS crisis."

It has been shown that take out food is very low risk.  To ask an employee not to get take out food on their own time borders on the unreasonable.  Glove wearing is also a double edged sword, unless you are using gloves to the gold standard, hand washing is just as good, maybe better."

2020-07-13 19:07:57,"Having been a professional nanny and tutor in college, I can say that being a live in version would be difficult. Just as it is hard to find a compatible roommate, it's even harder to find a family you're compatible with.

Not only that, but within the domestic worker professions, cleaning and cooking are very distinctive from nannying, which is distinctive from tutoring. To do all of those at once is, frankly, the parent's responsibility, not mine, and to do so, I would request to be paid for each separately, or at a higher rate for a package deal. Someone willing to do these, and with skills to clean, or cook, care for children, or tutor, will be hard to come by. Parents cannot expect to hire another parent -- and I think that's what many want right now.

 I believe the nannies should be able to request pricing that is equitable compensation for what they are sacrificing -- not a 30% reduction as is being seen in Brooklyn. 

I was paid $20/hr to babysit and $25/hr to tutor...and in Texas! If you expect both, pay at least that rate per hour for every hour I'm in your home. Anyone, especially in NY, expecting to pay $15/hr in a pandemic for childcare from someone with significant experience may need to reassess."

I acknowledge there are class issues here and there are employers that are unreasonable or exploitative. This has been happening before COVID. I'm curious to know what people think about COVID related childcare needs. Not all families that have the money for a nanny are heartless, rich people. In our family, we are essential healthcare workers, even though our work is from home. Our work responsibilities are unabating and we also face the bleak consequences of COVID on almost every phone call. We need to hire a nanny and have gone from one extreme to the other when thinking of what we should require to keep our household safe. What do you think is reasonable? What would you ask of your caregiver if they were coming in and out of your home each day? Our daughter is also immune-compromised. We may be privileged in that we can afford a nanny, but were also cursed in that we don't have a choice to quarantine completely. We have to expose ourselves. So then we have to figure out, what is the safest way to do that?"
2020-07-17 07:09:00,"While I don't have children, I can relate to some of these parents because I recently had to hire an aide to take care of my mother after she broke her left humerus.  She literally cannot take care of herself right now, and I can only do so much while working full time from home.  

Like these parents, I realize that I am more priviledged than they are.  But I am also spending money that I don't have, trying to make sure that my mother survives this.  I certainly can't afford to pay more than I currently am.  

I have not tried to control what they do outside of the home, but wearing a mask while near my mother doesn't seem like too much to ask since she is immunocompromized.  Especially while she is eating.  One of our two aides is wonderful.  The other one seems to think I am a) made of money, b)doesn't take basic virus precautions like washing her hands, and c) won't do anything unless specifically asked."
2020-07-17 10:32:09,"Of course, the data are starting to show that antibodies fade and one can be reinfected but that won't stop moms-on-a-mission."
2020-07-17 11:03:37,"There are a lot of negative replies to this article, however, for some uneducated women who lack computer skills and the ability to get an office job etc well the job of nanny would be appealing, it’s job and there are certainly worse ones.  And in these difficult times it is very understandable the concerns the employer would have about health and safety and would have every right to limit the coming and going of their staff.  Being a live in nanny isn’t for everyone but it works for some.

I for one wouldn’t want that risk of hiring a stranger (especially during the virus) and I do think most people should take responsibility for their own children, I just want to point out that the job does exist for a reason and some women would rather have that job than no job."
2020-07-17 17:49:58,"Probably the person offering $15/hr is either having financial issues themselves, or is negotiating. You can't exactly ditch a child you already have when your employer cuts you from the payroll. It's not just demanding nannies who have financial difficulties."
2020-07-18 17:16:43,"I’m a nanny and also have a teaching degree. My opportunities and job requests are very different from those of other nannies I’ve worked alongside who don’t have college degrees or don’t speak English as well. I often get mistaken for the mom by other nannies and other parents. I can charge a higher rate due to my education level and my full time experience and although I’m ok with doing light cleaning and cooking related to the children’s needs, I’ve found that some families just want someone they can ask to do everything for a much lower rate. It takes a lot of energy to care for someone else’s kid, especially when the parents are around 24/7 due to COVID so to ask someone to do everything else on top of that for 10 hrs a day definitely deserves a higher pay rate no matter someone’s ed. level. Families want someone on call on weekends too and expect you to say yes. I’ve heard unfair stories surrounding COVID matters as well. Demanding the nannies to be quarantined but then not fully quarantining themselves or getting upset when the nanny says they aren’t comfortable w/a plan and annoyed that their “nanny is deciding their plans now” when they could just not bring the nanny on the vacation trip...Being able to throw money at things you don’t want to do is a privilege and I wish more families realized that nannies are people too and have lives of their own and also need rest. If you want them to take on extra work then ask first and then pay them what they deserve."
2020-07-19 12:52:41,"First, read or re read the classic ""The Nanny Diaries"" by Kraus and McLaughlin, which was written in 2002 but is still applicable.

Second: through out history, kids were raised either in big extended families with many aunts, grandparents, older cousins and siblings.  OR by households with servants or slaves who were responsible for the babies and children. 

Finally:   the ""Leave it to Beaver"" or ""Donna Reed"" show  mode is very, very recent and no longer relevant  (this is aimed at those posters here who chide the working moms for needing help with child raising at all).

Childcare workers, whether in the home or in childcare centers should be trained adequately, held to a standard and well paid with benefits like sick leave and yes, shock! a pension.   How important are our kids to us as a society?"
2020-07-19 15:50:57,"Wanted, Nanny.  Must have high IQ, a master's degree, love (my) children.  Must not require sleep nor day off.  Must regard the ability to spawn by employer as the sole and compelling reason being subservience always.  Must perform all mommy duties.  Must cook, drive, take care of homework.  Run errands.  Medical degree preferred, nursing degree definitely a plus, and a degree in education is a must.  Must let mommy enjoy all pleasant bits, and manage all the unpleasant parts of parenting.  To discourage lecherous father, must be dowdy and plain.  Must be seen not heard, and better yet, not even seen.  And now, possess right antibodies.  A salary is not ruled out, but must pay for accommodation and meals while serving.  In some weeks, must expect a bill instead of a pay check.  

Really, in this day and age, is this too much to ask?"
2020-07-20 00:48:46,"I was most struck by the story of the nanny who was now being required to wear a mask, because her own young child was attending preschool while she worked. Wouldn’t it have been simpler to allow her to bring her child along to her nanny job? There would be less risk of Covid-19 being spread for both families, and the nanny’s charge(s) would have an extra playmate. One would think that a nanny with a child would be a plus, in a time when people are clamoring to reopen schools because children are missing out on social interactions. But perhaps that would humanize the nanny too much."
2020-07-20 16:02:16,Some buildings in New York are prohibiting nannies into the building unless they are living there full time....there will soon be a glut of apartments for rent or purchase in the city. It is untenable for an increasing number of families.
2020-07-21 14:41:04,"At the risk of being castigated, the freedom to contract (or not) is implicit in all of the stories in this article.  If the terms of employment are awful, keep looking."
2020-07-26 05:50:19,What I find *interesting* is that there was no mention of what the families were doing to protect the nannies. It appeared to be a one-sided conversation.
2020-07-26 19:16:59,Shouldn’t the hiring family sign a contract as well? Especially if the nanny has not had COVID.  So how about a bonus if the nanny gets sick because the host family is careless?
2020-08-15 05:01:40,"Being a professional maids trainer from a housekeeping company, and being an experienced person conducting training sessions for hundreds of maids and nannies, this article comes quite interesting to me.

I found it a bit strange the idea of the parents to look for nannies who were tested positive for Covid 19 but somehow it made sense. I'm working in Dubai and here in our government approved domestic workers agency we are keeping all the security and safety points in check before completing any maids contract and sending them to the hiring families.

We have seen a hike in demand for the private nannies who are capable of teaching the kids during these pandemic days and hence, for the live out nannies, the company made it must to wear new PPE kits every day to ensure the safety of herself and the people she interact with.

I have seen some comments here showing their concern over nanny's security, but I have a belief that if a family is strict on how a nanny should behave during her work period, the family will definitely care for their own safety. So, it doesn't seem to be a big issue for the nannies, at least in my perspective.

I think it’s time American’s realize they’re a third world country wearing a Gucci belt."
2020-07-14 11:05:43,"Corporate medicine, whose only goal is to maximize profits, minimize costs to the bare minimum to operate day to day and cannot respond to any anomalies like COVID-19.  The heads of the corporate medical system only see patients income and care little about the quality of their care.  This was already evidenced before COVID-19 by the fact that Americans pay the highest cost in the world for healthcare, with the least favorable outcomes compared to a very large number of other nations.  COVID-19 has shown a very bright light on how broken our corporate medical system model is."
2020-07-14 11:09:25,"Public health efforts have a negative impact on the bottom line, no one pays premiums, no kick back from industry. Governments had seen these investments as not worth while.  

We are paying the price. The lesson will be quickly forgotten and our children or their children will pay the price"
2020-07-14 11:34:46,"Time increase taxes on the 1% to fund decent public health structures. Time to take a harder look at the corporate healthcare system in this county where profit is more important than outcome or quality of care. Time to rethink our decentralized fragmented healthcare system where it is everyone for themselves. The myth that ""competition"" produces a viable healthcare system has been exposed. The lesson, loud and clear, is that you cannot have a viable economy without a viable public health care system. Consumers who are sick, unemployed or dead will not buy enough products to keep the corporations solvent. Good public health is in everyone's best interest."
2020-07-14 11:36:19,"I thought it is primarily a matter of social distancing and wearing a mask. Even the article said that when reopening started and some relaxed regarding these big two methods caseloads jumped. So, why is funding an issue if the most effective weapons we have are the responsibility of individual citizens?"
2020-07-14 11:44:09,"Public health as a whole identifies hot spots for health concerns, examines causes and then develops plans to mitigate cases. There should be a strong local effort for example with localized increases in  lead exposure from drinking water or local STD upticks, but when the health concern is a pandemic that has tragically ripped through all 50 states, the response must be controlled by a national public health team supervising that all tests are standardized, of sufficient quality, and equally available everywhere, all PPE is available equally in all states, and most importantly mandating national guidelines to prevent spread. Poor Dr Umair Shah is left to prevent a local tsunami of cases and of course is helpless.  Tony Fauci is in part to blame for only issuing concerns and warnings  and NOT demanding national efforts, building up national testing, travel guidelines, opening up timelines, etc. He is the physician’s voice and had the public ear at tens if those mom and pop shop trump COVID conferences. It is in most ways too late. We are indeed a third world country as a result of an abysmal public health response."
2020-07-14 11:50:34,"In many ways the USA is a developing country. Especially outside metropolitan areas, incomes, education, healthcare are on a par with ‘emerging’ countries- except they are going down, not up."
2020-07-14 11:53:09,How is U.S. Healthcare underfunded when it’s the highest percentage of GDP in the world? There’s no other country In the world that spends more on healthcare in total dollars and percentage of GDP. That kind of invalidates any correlation that’s attempting to be drawn between healthcare spending and COVID response.
2020-07-14 11:53:51,"A  healthy public is an economic resource in production and in consumption.
Sickness affects the economy.   We know this now because COVID19 has made it painfully obvious.
Health of American  citizens should be a top priority, not an afterthought.
Public health funding,  health education, and universal health insurance are essential in moving forward as a nation. 
Democrats should emphasize  this.   I know Republicans won't."
2020-07-14 12:07:17,"A great failure of the public health system has been the decades-long official line that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet is healthy. That and the huge increase in availability of processed foods (I suppose it's hard to blame the public health system for that, but we can certainly blame the American aversion to regulation of our industries, as well as our love for convenience) have been major factors in the increase in obesity in Americans over the last 30 years-- and obesity is now a known risk factor for severe symptoms from Covid-19."
2020-07-14 12:09:54,"After the post 9/11 anthrax attacks, the public health infrastructure at all levels of government received a massive boost under the Bioterrorism program. The the funding from HHS alone was $10B to build frontline labs across the country to deal with just this issue. So saying public health has been under funded “for decades” is simply not true. What did happen was the same thing that’s happening now: public health funding was politicized so funding could be directed for political purposes, not to where it would be most effective. In 2002, the funding was directed to powerful congressional districts. In 2020, funding is being misused out of sheer incompetence. Just ask NYS Department of Health Wadsworth Laboratory why it took so long to fund its replacement lab (even though it caught fire in 2012) and State of California why they didn’t get funding for labs under the bioterrorism program. The point is: whatever scenarios are playing out now, no one built politics or incompetence into their response plans. This is a crisis of our own making."
2020-07-14 12:11:14,"Judging by percentage of GDP American health care should be among the world’s best. But, as others have noted, most of that wealth is evaporated by graft, excess profits, and plainly ineffective investments. 

But let’s not ignore the American culture which enables this to take place. America has always leaned more toward cures and treatments than preventions, a very expensive habit.  And let’s face it; we’re not really close to even thinking seriously about changing, are we?  Nope. We’re a culture of over-militarized police (rather than social and mental health programs) and pills (rather than health loss prevention).  It’s much better business."
2020-07-14 12:11:32,"I think it also has to do with Americans’ general valuing of individualism over civic responsibility, cooperation, and community.  Health is thought of as just another individual consumer choice or reward."
2020-07-14 12:11:53,"The US was doing fine when people were sheltering in place.  It's not the health system, it's the ""can't be bothered"" generation that would rather dance and drink in a crowded bar than save a few old lives.

And this is the same generation that believes it can make the necessary sacrifices to reverse climate change and improve the world in so many ways -- changes that will require so much more than merely putting on a mask."
2020-07-14 12:18:18,"The article next to this one in the digital Times details how cases have exploded along the Rio Grande. 

Not because of lack of tracking, or insurance.

Surely that is also part of public health."
2020-07-14 12:30:13,"The current pandemic is not a one off. Scientists have determined that bats carry about 500 viruses that could infect humans. We cannot change the culture in other countries where killing and eating exotic wildlife is acceptable. Unfortunately, an outbreak of a deadly virus can spread across the world in a matter of days. And then there is the specter of biological warfare. This virus has illustrated how an ill prepared country can be brought to its knees by a public health emergency. And then there are the upcoming as yet unknown ravages that will result from climate change. Not having a strong public health system in the 21st century puts a county on a path towards self-destruction. Improving and maintaining a strong public health system is and will continue to be a matter of national security. We need to turn this ship around."

Traffic is virtually back to pre-Covid levels, the grocery stores are full, and retail stores and restaurants are open, albeit in a limited capacity. Office buildings are almost empty, with office employees working from home. Most people are acting responsibly, wearing masks in public, although there are a few people who refuse.  I don’t sense a wave of panic. I’m sure the perspective is different at the medical center here. Local news reports say the public hospitals are full and have transferred patients to private hospitals in the suburbs."
2020-07-14 12:47:51,Excellent article. Interlandi articulated and explained things I've felt/wondered about here in Austin.
2020-07-14 12:52:30,"Interesting article about the complexities of the system. However, I am missing any mention of the problem of sick leave in the US. A substantial number of employees in the US do not feel free to call in sick and must fear loss of income or job loss if they do. Going to work while contagious remains the only option for many, thus contributing to the spread. Part of the public health care discussion and health coverage for all has to be about sick leave.

I live in Germany and am extremely grateful for robust employee protection laws. Employers are legally required to provide at least six weeks of sick leave per illness at full salary. After that, employees who are insured in the statutory health insurance (public health insurance) receive about 70% of their last salary, paid by the insurance. This can continue up to 3 years. Thus, cancer patients do not get fired. Even if a person does, for other reasons, lose their job, insurance coverage remains, funded by other systems.

We feel safer knowing that people do not have to drag their viruses to work, and generally instruct our young colleagues to suppress their strong work ethic for a few days and sit out their colds at home."
2020-07-14 13:07:11,"This article accurately describes the chronic underfunding of public health, especially compared to our healthcare delivery system.  Yet it was telling that almost all of the photos were from the healthcare system.  Public health work continues to be invisible."
2020-07-14 13:15:53,"It is a great article. Thank you very much. I think we, as a country, have failed to come up with a right set of metrics to determine success. Everything is measured by Wall Street success - Stock Index etc. This pandemic still will not get the attention it deserves, even after thousands of deaths, because Dow Jones is still at 26,000. I do not even understand why it is at 26,000 today. True measures of success should have been access to decent affordable healthcare, safe working environment, decent retirement protections, clear air and water, affordable housing, affordable education, healthy investment in science and arts and fair and just judicial system."

Also, if there's one issue that could make the rich and ""insulated middle class"" realise that they are part of a broader system, that needs to be treated holistically, other than war, this would be it. But I can't feel optimistic that this will bring a divided people together. Thanks, Ronnie, Jesse Helms, and the countless Republican senators for ensuring the demise of sanity in your ranks."
2020-07-14 10:54:08,"When I lived in Japan and France, who just gave it’s healthcare workers a billion in raises, on student and then work visas, my European and American friends and I received excellent and almost entirely free healthcare. The governments of .civilized. countries made their citizens feel as if their lives and wellbeing were of value. Citizens health and wellbeing is the point of good governance. By contrast, here in the United States, if you can’t provide the one percent a source of income, you are thrown away like trash. Betsy Devos further epitomizes this utter lack of regard for the wellbeing and health of American children. The ACA, by making healthcare a for-profit industry, forcibly extracting billions from the healthcare system and using our sick bodies as a means for profit is the ultimate insult to the soul of our nation. One of Biden’s crowning jewels. The vote to invade another sovereign country knowingly based on a lie which resulted in ongoing death and despair, and Obamacare. Will we vote in government that joins the rest of the civilized world in time to enact the Green New Deal, in time to honor the health and wellbeing of our citizens, regardless of wealth or access to great power, and work to also honor and save all life on Earth?"
2020-07-14 11:30:46,"This is just another reason why our levels of income inequality are a terrible idea.

Allowing the vast majority of money and future gains to go to a sliver of the population means less money for public health, so when things need to be paid for they are either cut or raise taxes.

Of course when you're wealthy you have greater political power it's easier to get services cut when you're not interested in paying more taxes, especially when you have money to pay for private medical services who are on call 24/7"
2020-07-14 12:14:09,"I just did my son's taxes.  He is in college, and receives scholarships and grants, along with taking out loans.  He asked why he owed taxes from his summertime income.  I answered,""Republicans"".  They have been cutting aid and taxing that aid more and more in an effort to keep kids who were not born wealthy, from being on an equal footing in life, with those of the wealthy, largely because so many of them have children like Donald Trump, who could not make in life without his way being bought, and then having his tracks covered.
Now we have another, even more existential problem:  A starved public health system that cannot function without clearing their statements through the most corrupt, political government that any living American has ever had to put up with. 
Add to that, the starved public education system the Republicans have been starving since, you guessed it: school integration, and you see our existential peril coming closer and looming larger, because people who follow this administration's disinformation are not smart enough to know a lie, even when it is spoken openly, and is literally standing on their necks."
2020-07-14 12:15:05,"Here in the Cayman Islands, we have successfully contained the virus with a 10 week lock down, isolating new arrivals and residents returning home from all over the globe by air and sea, quarantining those that test positive, and contact tracing.  We did all of the things that global experts (including American experts) said that we should do, and the result has been a low infection rate and only one death.  The person that died was a visitor by cruise ship with underlying conditions.  No citizens or residents have died, very few were hospitalized with symptoms and the majority of infected were asymptomatic.  

So why has this little 2nd world country succeeded where the powerful resource-rich United States has failed?  We all did what the experts told us to do.  We took the recommendations of experts seriously, put rules in place based on expert guidance, and the entire community followed the rules.  We didn’t question or push back.  We didn’t wave our individual rights around and refuse to conform.  We as a community did what was right for all in the community.  That’s where America has failed.  They lack unity and a common sense of responsibility to do what is right for the entire community."

And the NYT, like the ruling class in the Democratic and Republican parties, dismissed the call for a universal national healthcare system during the primaries. The wealthy always had their needs covered."
2020-07-14 12:38:46,"Why is US losing the COVID19 battle? 

First, commonsense is amiss in all states. People have stopped thinking. Step outside and not many people wear masks, restaurants and servers don't seriously consider social distancing rules. Even a tuk tuk driver in Thailand dons a mask, second country that reported COVID19 and able to minimize infections with a low death rate of 58. 

Second, having strong leaders matter. We are leader-less with states left to fend the COVID19 battle on their own.

Third, our healthcare system is fractured. When Todd is getting a $7000 COVID19 bill and Mary is has to pay $34,000, there is a dysfunction in the system. 

Fourth, never mind. Vote in November!"
2020-07-14 12:39:25,"Great article. Other than the brief mention of university public health departments becoming more “academic”, the role of those departments is obscured. First, what do you mean by “academic”.? Second, these institutions have much to answer for. Johns Hopkins and others absorb huge federal and state grants and should be vocal avatars of public health. How many graduates do they turn out each year? Where do these graduates get jobs? The private sector, predominantly. Perhaps requiring schools to train more (scholarships for some public service) would result in more attention. There used to be programs that paid nursing school tuition in exchange for a few years of service in underserved locations. I am told these ended. Considering the cost of higher ed alongside the need for various professions in different communities—why not put the money into scholarships. Instead the government pays private, often underperforming, companies to do the job which means each dollar spent must fund the profits of company, the oversight of the company, and attempt a national coordination. Just ideas—I’m no expert."

2020-07-14 11:00:51,"No, this is less about public health funding (although that is crucial) and more about exploiting for political gain America’s founding myth of freedom, and also the obvious lack of social cohesion today.

Pick any two days worth of new infections this week, and you have a sum greater than all infections in Canada since the pandemic began.

The data shows I am far safer living in a country who’s national motto is Peace, Order and Good Governance, overtone reading  Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Indoor restaurants will reopen here (albeit modified) next week; Ontario was the second hardest hit province.  We’re not in a race.  The push for us has been to get this right, while U.S. public health policy at the federal level seems driven by the never ending/upcoming election.  

I don’t see this as resolvable. Eventually a vaccine may become available, but what about the next time? Given the gridlock in your system of government, you are at a place where you can’t get much of anything done, let alone pull together for challenges this colossal.

Parts of our cities are third world inholdings in a developed nation.
Indian reservations, long neglected, usurped, and plundered easily qualify for third world states.
Rural areas and even some states, improvised by shifting energy and manufacturing industries rank right up there with Venezuela and Chad in their economic security.

2020-07-14 13:00:16,"In an otherwise good article, the explanation that “Americans don’t like being told what to do” seems really inadequate to account for the failures and lack of funding for our public health system. It would be more accurate to say that corporate investors and decision-makers “don’t like being told what to do” -- especially when it affects their profit margins – and that these corporate interests exert a vast influence through mass media, politicians, and educational institutions. 

After all, it’s corporate investors and CEOs who are most responsible for the U.S.’s polluted air and groundwater, for our notoriously unhealthy fast-food diet, our addictions to tobacco and pain-killers, our dangerous automobiles, our third-world inequality, and our corrupt government. With corporations in control we can’t really expect an adequate public health system, can we?"

2020-07-14 13:37:17,"I deeply respect Fauci and believe he has the nation’s best interest at heart, but I wish he would have a pragmatic discussion with our country about end of life planning (EOLP).  With his age he would be the perfect conduit to have this discussion with our country. 
In a pandemic, when the nation’s med. resources are stretched, does a senior in a nursing home want to take up an ICU bed when their likelihood of having any quality of life after surviving a Covid case that requires an ICU stay is nil. 

Doctors and nurses are overwhelmed, and we need as a country and as citizens to wisely invest limited resources. If hospitals are overwhelmed with extreme long shot cases, it diverts resources from survivable heart attacks, strokes,etc.  An ambulance transporting an 89 year old from a memory care unit may not be able to assist a 55 year old survivable heart attack victim.  It is a zero-sum game.

 My aunt, a nurse, had to have the difficult conversation with my 93 year old grandpa regarding a DNR clause in his EOLP. At first, he said he wanted to be resuscitated.  Thankfully, she lovingly explained to him that if they had to do CPR he would likely break multiple ribs. She further explained that his likelihood of survival would be low and if he did survive his quality of life would most likely be much lower. He logically and thankfully changed his mind. God bless you Aunt P.

 Fauci: Be brave, be bold, be a hero and have that difficult conversation with our country. We need it."

The idea that American capitalism cannot be robust and also support an equivalent safety net for its citizens as other wealthy democracies isn't patriotic, it's the opposite and worse- it's homicidal. 

Our health care system is a patch-work full of holes, our industrial food complex creates a siren song for poisonous life styles, especially from high sugar industrial food beginning with ads to toddlers to eat at McDonald's and get free toys.  

Poverty shouldn't be dangerous to one's health in a modern and wealthy country, but in America it is.  Now the wealthy have discovered that low wage workers are also essential components of our economy- their lives matter even to the investment class (even if the stock market is lying about it right now).

Let's hope that American voters wake up to the essential components that have made Covid-19 such a relative catastrophe in the U.S.  and vote for change as much as our warped political system allows."

Trump says it's 99% trivial and people who want to believe that are going to believe it.  Hidalgo is correct in that people don't follow recommendations as often as they do orders.  Maybe she ought consider that if people aren't following her recommendations, she isn't making a persuasive case.

The overweening penchant for personal liberty to the exclusion of social responsibility (“People have grown comfortable putting their individual rights ahead of the needs of their community.”) is a very real sociocultural malignancy. Disdain for others couldn’t be more evident than in so many refusing to wear masks, aggressively congregating to drink and eat, ignoring anything other than themselves and other like them. 
America’s much touted individualism is very likely our Achilles heel. While engendering creativity and entrepreneurism, the self regard too often associated with individualism belies social needs — especially on a planet approaching 8 billion. 
And America has a “leader” who flat out refuses responsibility — a more perverse failing than not wearing a mask.

We should spend more on public health, but we should also stop subsidizing the organizations that attack science and other facts and write-off the value of human lives while on Earth.

One might contest priorities that send most tax dollars towards the means to kill millions with “advanced weapons” instead of raising children and supporting adults to reconcile our differences towards fairness and justice.

Instead, we’re told that creationism should stand on equal footing with evolution, that religious faith equals science—at least when it comes the fundamentalist “Christianity”—and that school choice through privatization will save our children from the terrors of integration across race and class.

The business of America should be uniting us toward the humane treatment of humans—not racism, sexism, and classism to set us against each other in a false fight for survival while money moguls laugh their way to the bank...  again."

1. A leader (Angela Merkel) who saw what was coming early on, knew what to do, had the courage to do it, was open and clear in her messaging, never lied, never belittled, never sought any kind of gain for herself, who just thought about the people

2. A people that trust such a leader, that follow orders, that can think for themselves, that know their best interests, that have the stamina to sit on the couch and binge-watch for weeks on end without going crazy.

One might also add that the general social structure (aka ""Socialism!!!"" if you listen to Fox) helped a lot. Companies were able to furlough workers easily - because there are laws, established in the 60's, that make sure workers get paid ""enough"" to survive by the state. In the U.S. Congress had to hop through loops to establish something similar.

Or take health care, from the viewpoint of a worker. Got fired? No problem! Your health care continues for three month, no matter what. Once you apply for unemployment benefits it continues until these end. And after they end and you go to ""ALG-2"" you STILL get health care.

Because of that people were much more willing to follow the rules,much calmer, kept shopping. And because of that our peak was low, our curve flat, our economy saved.

If we had done the right things, that we could do from the beginning ,and worn the masks, done the social distancing and followed the leads of those with experience, we still would have had economic fall out and issues. But it perhaps, would have been for a shorter period of pain . Civil rights are important, Civil responsibility should be even MORE relevant and important . To those of you who think the COVID is a hoax, and all ""fake news""...it is your choice to risk your own life.

2020-07-14 13:25:40,"Properly funding public health is imperative.  But it is absolutely not the reason why the virus is raging in the US.

The primary reason the virus is raging in the US is simply that it is a very substantial portion of the population refuse to wear masks and engage in activities that involve many people being in close proximity to each other.  

The refusal to wear masks is done by people on the right as a political statement, and it is done by people on the left out of either laziness or stupidity (look at photos of the Floyd George protests, see photos of young people at beaches or in bars).

Evidence that greater funding of public health would NOT have made much reduction in the casualties from this virus is that even with the best medical care available in the best hospital facilities, there is NO vaccine, NO cure, and NO effective treatment.  Only when vaccine or cure is available, will more funding of public health be able to make a difference."

So it was illuminating to read this article, both to get the historical context as well as a better perspective why America can’t seem to get it together to organize a coherent response to the virus. It seems that unless a threat is visible, as so many were for Harris County that prompted the praise given Hildago afterwards, many Americans feel entitled to gauge the risks to their own health based on either misinformation or political beliefs, or some false sense of bravado, let alone the scapegoating which Trump has tried to pawn off on the Chinese.

If COVID-19 had the same effects as the Bubonic plague in the Middle Ages, I wonder what the death rate would be in this country. That’s essentially how people should be viewing this virus, because even if it doesn’t kill you, it could kill someone you love. What is this false sense of security?"

A visiting nurse saw her and she had two trips to the emergency room for falls one in which she struck her head and another that resulted in 15 stitches in her hand.  But, despite that she was not getting the care she needed and no-one could see her. Finally towards the end her doctor said he would visit at her home but he never made it because my brother found mom on the floor and got her to the emergency room. Now, finally in the good care of the ER physicians they did a full workup and found that she had cracked vertebrae in her neck and infected fluid around her heart.

The excess healthcare 'costs' - 5% to 7% in the USA - is a combination of corporate profit and greed, middleman insurer profit and greed, pharmaceutical company profit and greed, hospital 'corporation' profit and greed, rich shareholder profit and greed, and other unregulated healthcare profit and greed.

The excess healthcare costs total at least $1 trillion annually to excess corporate profit and greed.

There is no logical or humane reason for this American healthcare corporate rip-off.....except that the Republican party has demanded that this be the cruel case for forty-plus years by demanding 'free-market' failure and ineffectiveness for America's human healthcare.

The Republican Party is nobody's healthcare friend...except for your local corporate healthcare company's CEO and richest shareholders.

Vote for humane healthcare progress and against unregulated healthcare profits.

What’s with the total lack of private service ads on National Media about how to get this devastating Pandemic under control?  It’s not like there’s a lack of motivation to fund and run thirty-second ads non-stop on every media platform.

 Any fifteen-year old with a modicum of creativity could create heart a series of heart wrenching ads designed with one goal in mind: scare the living bejesus out of every self-centered ignorant narcissist in the United States.

I find it difficult to believe all of the deep pockets sitting around in self-isolation on Martha’s Vineyard and Lake Como moaning about losing precious profits by-the-minute wouldn’t hesitate to invest in Public Service Advertising designed specifically to motivate our stubborn bubble brained neighbors to follow the advice of Health Care Experts and get this Pandemic under control.

From downplaying the risk to openly asking people to break social distancing rules in an effort to ""liberate"" no one has done more to make sure we fail to control the pandemic.  Wearing a mask and practicing social distancing isn't hard unless you are being told it is.

On a more optimistic note, although in a very limited sense of course, Covid-19 seems too have thrown a lot of that out of the window.

Others simply refuse to admit there is a problem (these people are generally known as Trump Republicans).

All the public health in the world is not going to help these people.  Of course, it's not just Texas.  Immunity from unpleasant facts is rife throughout the country.  If that immunity proved fatal to just the one person, I'm at the point where I wouldn't really mind, but they can spread it, and that's a problem.

More than 400,000 servicemen and servicewomen made the ultimate sacrifice.

Certainly a great deal more could have been done to slow down the spread of covid had we had a national pandemic response ready in January.  That being said, underfunding of health departments has nothing to do with the spread of covid, particularly in Texas.  People in states with covid surging simply are not observing precautions like wearing masks, social distancing and hand hygiene.  In states and countries where these behaviors are widespread, may see an occasional blip, but not the geometric increase in disease we are seeing in Texas and California. Testing and contact tracing are of no avail if people won't observe the simplest behaviors to protect themselves and others.  These behaviors cost health departments nothing, and are, quite frankly, a very small burden on us as individuals.  By now, everyone knows this, and it is a national shame that we can't get better compliance."

They failed because Americans didn't do them. The rest of the world has been successful.

Attitudes and unscientific personal beliefs are at least as important as funding. People started out following edicts, saw a decrease in cases, and declared ""Mission Accomplished"" and then ignored rules about masks, social distancing and large groups of people.

The general New York City area has gotten their numbers way down because of vast mortality  and extreme fear. They followed medical recommendations. Scientists fear that people there will now relax because the virus is ""solved"" and even they will have a second peak.

Even now I see in CA stores with ""masks required"" policies, significant numbers of customers with masks pulled down not to cover nose and mouth.  Because they don't believe scientists.

Throw as much money at the problem as you want but our courageous medical personnel can't eliminate the coronavirus by themselves. Americans must participate.

 In reality, they are closet anarchists who no longer understand that being part of a civilized society means assuming a sense of shared responsibility, that sometimes one must do or accept certain things for the common societal good.  The persistent refusal of many (a majority?) of Texans to do simple basic things such as wearing a protective facial mask, avoiding crowded indoor spaces, maintaining social distancing of six feet from other people whenever possible, etc., is a badge of honor in much of Texas.

In my view, media failed to push back when Trump and his minions eschewed using the DPA as it was intended--during a national or international crisis--instead regurgitating the sniveling free market response.  Federal lawmakers repeatedly pushed back on this folly, but media failed to educate the public or consult with federal procurement experts to ascertain whether Trump's refusal made any sense.

Public health has been trying, as have multiple authors and scientists, warning about emerging diseases. 
And then there is denial as a defense mechanism. Zika, SARS, MERS, Ebola, dengue and the mosquito borne diseases. Nah, they can't get to America. Yes they can, and have. 
Then there is the funding defense. We need a tax cut for the wealthy, to stimulate spending. Sure, wanna buy a bridge? And they don't get pandemic bugs anyway. Whoops. Trump's grandfather died from the pandemic flu.
Now we're out of defenses, including masks and other PPE. No drugs (expensive, won't sell until we're in a pandemic). Same for vaccines. 
Now we find the CDC NIH NIAID and FDA tend to be politically driven and led by appointees or long term people, comfortable with public health plight as long as they have jobs. 
It's a miracle docs and nurses are with us. Let's put them in charge, because whomever is in charge, isn't cutting it."

2020-07-14 17:22:17,"All restaurants & bars should be required to use disposable silverware & plateware. We can no longer afford to continue to infect our population centers because of outdated protocols that continue to are spread Covid 19.

Restaurants & bars are not required to properly disinfect silverware & tableware in order to eliminate Covid 19. It's not just a coincidence that when they reopen, there's an immediate spike in outbreaks, & it's more than the lack of social distancing.

Most bars use just a 3 compartment sink to 'clean glasses'. They briefly dip the glass in dirty soap water, then dip it into a sink of water, & then briefly into sanitizer.

Unfortunately, the sanitizer requires 1 minute immersion to to be effective instead of the 5 seconds that it usually receives. Watch any bartender & you will see how quickly they just dip the glass in the 3 sinks - it's an overlooked weak-link in our viral defense efforts.

A restaurant dishwasher has to handle each piece of silverware, plate, glass & cup after it is washed in order to stack & sort. If he is asymptomatic, presymptomatic or has just touched an infected plate or surface, he is going to be infecting you when you plunge your silverware into your mouth that he grabbed with his infected fingers. 

As a former restaurant General Manager, I can tell you these shortfalls often reach appalling levels of cross-contamination during a busy shift. These protocols were never designed for a pandemic."
2020-07-14 17:23:53,"Public health and private healthcare are on a direct collision course. In private healthcare it's a ""bad"" month when there are fewer beds filled, i.e. when public health is doing a good job. The calculation is more complicated during this pandemic; hospitals want to be full -- but not too full -- but underlying the basic problem of keeping people well is literally the bottom line. For example one hidden scandal in the US is how many people die of the flu which is largely preventable.  Why aren't hospitals giving out vaccinations for free?  Because profits depend on treating  hundreds of thousands of flu patients.

The goal of US healthcare must be keeping people well; only then healthcare be in sync with public health."
2020-07-14 17:27:25,"This is an excellent article. It goes deep into the reasons why this country is losing the battle against COVID19. There are several important issues brought up, but the two that jumped off the page at me are 1:  Americans don't like to be told what to do and 2: We have no national health plan to respond to a national health crisis. 
I lived through the Polio epidemic of the 1950s. There was a national response and nearly every child was vaccinated and the virus all but disappeared. Now we have the anti vaxer movement which pedals misinformation that may lead to thousands of people refusing to get vaccinated. We may not be able to attain herd immunity if this becomes widespread across the country.
I'm am so tired of hearing people say that being forced to wear a mask or get vaccinated ""violates my constitutional rights"". What ever happened to doing something for the common good? Pure selfishness won't get us out of this debacle, consideration for your fellow citizens and doing the right thing will.
We also need to take a hard look at funding for national health plan to be able to deal with the next crisis to come along...and it's not a question of if but when it will happen. 
We need to somehow get a national response plan in place. It's too late for this pandemic, but we need to get to work on one for the future...now."
2020-07-14 17:42:23,"In medicine, the patient is the individual. In public health, the patient is the community. We look “upstream” for root causes and social determinants of health. This is why we recognize how poverty affects health and education outcomes, making those with a lower SES more vulnerable to infections (based on job status and housing vulnerabilities).

We forget that clean water (chlorine and fluoride, less tobacco smoke), clean air, safe milk (pasteurization), family planning (contraception), vaccination, and safer cars, job sites, homes, and food are all the results of public health efforts.

I’m proud to be a 45-year public health worker, despite almost all of our efforts uphill and underfunded. We don’t have the glamour, but we get the results.

Truly, we do it for you, not for ourselves. So let’s give the public health leaders a break, and realize that our advice is to help us all, as a community. We are all in this together, like it or not."

That statement is way too broad and merits a Fact Check.

Obamacare aka the Affordable Care Act dates back to 2010. We can thank Senator Ted Cruz in Texas and the GOP for the advocacy in reversing the benefits of ACA.

If ACA was not dismantled there would be some public health apparatus.

What is so disappointing about the lack of vision and leadership is the realization that losing the battle with Covid means that we lose the battle for the economy.

In order to have a strong and healthy economy, you need to have a strong and healthy workforce.

So thank you Senator Ted Cruz and your fellow GOP for your shortsightedness. It's quite evident now. How ironic that it is in your home state."
2020-07-14 17:52:32,"Excellent article.  Unfortunately not much space has been given to the context or discussion of public health as in this article.  One omission in an otherwise through account are the successful campaigns against smoking.  Who ever thought that smoking would be banned in bars and restaurants?  and that there would be consensus on this despite those weary arguments about personal freedoms.  As the article points out it is hard to measure the things that have been prevented, but there is good data on the reduction in cancer that the reduction in tobacco use has caused."
2020-07-14 18:02:17,"This pandemic requires heroic leadership.  They have to make decisions when it barely looks bad.  If they wait until it's actually bad, then there is a long runway to get things under control because COVID-19 can take weeks to develop from exposure to first symptoms to hospitalization and death.  Leaders can't be worried about what people think.  They need to follow the science.  People will whine and throw tantrums like 5 year olds especially on social media.  Leaders need to make concrete decisions and stay the course.  We also need to be less concerned with occasionally going backwards in our reopening.  If there wasn't so much stigma attached to the idea, then maybe we could partially shut down for a couple of weeks the moment it looks like we're heading in the wrong direction.  Again, holding off on shutting down risks having to make the shut down more extreme.  

As a corollary to this, we need to better support our businesses and get unemployment compensation to everyone who can't work.  We need to make this compensation simple to turn on and off if we need to re-close businesses.  We need to remove the excuses for people to violate orders and risk people's heath for the sake of putting food on their tables.  It might well be true that we can't afford to let some businesses reopen, and those businesses shouldn't be penalized."

The majority of us have been holding our breath, hoping against hope that nothing catastrophic would occur to threaten the nation. We almost made it. Now, here we are.

The low cost and high benefit of public health spending when compared to cost/benefit of clinical medicine tells most of the whole story, and we Americans have our priorities ass-backwards. 

Our lack of universal, single-payer healthcare tells the rest of the story.

We are going to pay a terrible price. We have asked for it."

2020-07-14 17:32:17,"""In the meantime, almost none of Abbott’s own criteria for a safe reopening were being met. Testing capacity was still limited, and contact tracing had yet to be sufficiently scaled up. Officials had no hope of pinpointing potential case surges or of keeping them in check. And if they could not contain the virus once they reopened, the entire shutdown would have been for nothing.""

The critical fork in that road was between when Trump and Pence promised millions of tests and one week later when Trump said to the Governors, “We’re not a shipping clerk!”

Trump’s pandemic response was hijacked by Republicans in power who oppose, on principle, the idea of government stepping in to produce anything (except bombers). So they deferred to the private market to produce tests and supplies which failed and is still failing; and where’s the profit in public health and contract tracing?

Even if we closed down now and got the virus under control we would still be stuck with a Republican government that refuses to use its power to direct the production of tools needed to reopen safely and instead defers to the magic free market. It’s death by Republican ideology."

How is that any different from not wearing a mask indoors in a crowded space. In both situations your actions could kill someone else, and take away their personal freedom to live. 

Also, this is not either-or, public health or economic health, this again is both or none. A healthy economy requires healthy people and vice versa, period. Both require a healthy health care system. What good is it to have an open economy if people are too sick to work or to afraid to go into work or can’t go because they are quarantined or have to look after a sick loved one?  All other counties that have controlled the first wave have moved to a new normal of acceptable human behaviour to protect yourself, your community and to do your job and lead your life in a different safer way than 4 months ago. America has rejected that strategy wishing to go back to the old normal with many vocal Americans including Trump arguing for economic reopening and liberate “your state” at the expense of people’s health and social responsibility.

How does one win against a tidal wave, earthquake, tornado, a once in a hundred years flood? You can prepare for the events and humans rarely prepare well enough. The term I heard at the beginning of the pandemic was ""flatten the curve."" Which is interesting. I guess some came to think that flatten the curve meant ""stop the spread."" But those are two different statements. I thought flatten the curve was to get the hospitals and social services ready for the inevitable surge in cases that were going to show up in ALL communities at some time. But what we got was that people looked to New York State and once they were over their hump as to case load a lot of those in the country seemed to think that the pandemic was over. The curve was flattened but it was far from over. We flattened the curve then parts of the country opened up and the clusters grew at an alarming rate. But not really if you look at NY States path. It needs to be said that the pandemic takes roughly 3 months from the beginning to the end of a large cluster growth and decline cycle. And flatten the curve NEVER meant that we weren't going to HAVE to have it in our communities. We were just filling the sandbags getting ready for the water to rise.

For this to be reality, there has to be a necessary level of belief in the mutual well-being and interdependence of individuals and the community (i.e., society). America has never succeeded in teaching our young the values of what Erich Fromm termed ""The Sane Society."" The resulting concentration on Emersonian Self-Reliance, extreme individualism and concern only with one's own rights have given us a culture that barely recognizes the communal nature of public health and security. We struggle with this even in the current catastrophic emergency.

The political pendulum-swinging between Republican and Democratic understandings of America's well-being demonstrates the true meaning of our dilemma as a society: we have no shared unity or a political vocabulary to express it. And for me at 85, it means I have never seen any society-wide problem faced  and solved during my lifetime. We are stuck in a kind of primitive thinking about individual ""rights"" that guarantees we will never achieve, as a society, a permanent awareness of all being in the same boat.

For the longest time, there have been many aspect of this selfishly greedy society that have needed genuine reform.  Here is the exposure of that need in all it's horror.

Clearly, it was Norquest's goal to to  shrink the nation's minority and poor  populations  so as  to preserve the dominance of well-to-do white Americans.   He might even argue that the poor and minorities are dispensable.  There is no reason to spend on health for them If they are dispensable .

To be consistent Norquest would need to advocate for  significant immigration quotas, a policy that differs from the Trump administration.  In fact, Norquest is  consistent.  In 2012 he told an  audience '""It's not only good policy to have more immigrants in the United States -- dramatically more immigrants than we do today, to having a path forward for those people who are here. It's not only a good idea, but it's good politics.'""  <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/grover-norquist-immigration-reform/story?id=17471517"" target=""_blank"">https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/grover-norquist-immigration-reform/story?id=17471517</a>

Construction work continued even when it was on hold and people were not wearing masks. It got really bad around Memorial Day, when there were lots of parties and gatherings. Those have continued every week since then. When areas started opening up, a lot of people thought it was safe thanks to the terrible messaging job the Federal government has done.

Here's looking at you President Obama, who continued the wars his entire 8 years, & expanded the neo-con, intervention first regime change nonsense to Syria, Libya, Yemen, Ukraine, Honduras, etc.  

When elites from both parties prefer to take real, hard-earned tax dollars, paid by individual income tax payers, business owners, etc. spread all across America, & then throw this money down the toilet hole of the military-industrial complex, is it any surprise there is no money left for domestic investment, including public health, among other priorities?

Even safe-seat Democrats from entirely ""blue"" states & so-called ""progressives"" like Bernie Sanders, who talk the talk, ultimately walk the walk of the military-industrialists (take a look at the F35 fighter jet basing in Burlington & how that went down).

When veterans like Tulsi Gabbard dare to challenge this orthodoxy, they are smeared by people like Hillary Clinton as so-called ""Russian assets.""

Unfortunately the divisive atmosphere created by the current administration in politicizing the American experience of the pandemic has enabled dissent in many states and regions. Consequently, this has caused a resurrgence of the infection rate even beyond proportions witnessed in the early days of the initial shut down. 

America has performed worse than 3rd world countries in this pandemic because we have flouted the simple discipline of social distancing and use of face mask as prescribed by experts. 

As other countries reduce their infection rates, American's will be isolated by these countries lest we re-infect them. The recent experience with US Marines stationed in Japan is a clear case in point."

Had we all stayed in lockdown mode a few more weeks, we would not now have an out-of-control virus with no end in sight. Had Trump instead listened to the experts and encouraged governors to follow their guidelines for reopening, many thousands of people might be alive today. Trump and his supporters have aggravated the situation to the point where we may be dealing with this virus for years until (and if) an effective vaccine is developed. We seem to have an amazingly ill-informed populace that believes whatever Trump tells them. As Mark Twain said, “In religion and politics people’s beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing.” As we’ve all seen, Donald Trump’s opinions are not worth a brass farthing."

Instead of seeing the pandemic for what it is - a complex scientific, economic, and sociological challenge  - the Trump administration treats it as a public relations problem. While Republicans use to play at patronage and politics. They only care about 'the numbers' as a political liability. Not the lives they represent.

Well now we see where ignoring the fact-based, valid recommendations  of public health and medical personnel have gotten us as a country - on a fast track to everything Dr. Fauci and colleagues warned, a never ending nightmare.  We have a president who is undeniably ignorant about history, is obsessed with economic fantasy to ensure (he believes) his reelection, and who disregards any scientific data but who bears the major responsibility for the current unnecessary  pandemic tsunami in this country. In fairness to Trump, the failure of government to adequately fund public health programs after this crisis of catastrophic proportions is not new, but hopefully in the imminent and foreseeable future we should learn from history, invest in preventive public health programs so that the next COVIID can be more systematically and thoroughly addressed."

With the permission of those suffering from the Coronavirus, could you possibly make and post a video of your loved one, showing what the disease and its complications are like for those who catch it?

These may not be pleasant scenes, but the alternatives are worse.
HEPPA regulations may prevent medical and other frontline workers from doing this, even with permissions, but family and connected friends at least can post real life and death videos to wake more folks up to what we are doing to ourselves and others. 

EVERYWHERE, more of us need to wake up, acknowledge we have caused the spike in cases, and pledge for all our sakes to: 
	Always wear a mask in public 
	Shelter at home as much as possible
	Keep safe physical distances
	Use disposable gloves
	Wash hands, and

None of this piecemeal incremental dabbling around the edges of improving things because we're too scared of bold change. We are spinning our wheels and not helping people. I live in Harris County, TX and work in Alaska. Alaska has the closest thing to universal healthcare coverage we have by way of extensive Medicaid and excellent private healthcare benefits for their residents. Few people go uninsured. In Texas, the government does not care if you get sick. And our national government doesn't either. We can pour billions into public health but it won't change a thing if we can't afford to go to the doctor."

The point being, Houston has excellent leadership, and I'm glad this article focussed on them.  Because it makes it clear the problem is not with them, but with the state and federal political leadership.

What's most amazing is how the federal Republican administration is now opposed to states rights, and wants to force states to have bad policies.  And how Republican states like Texas and Florida now are opposed to local government.  They don't want to be proven wrong.  

Public Health budgets need to be a bigger part of every state and locality.  And so much of pollution regulation also falls under PH that the budget needs to keep growing to help mitigate the effects of climate change."

Regarding the future of businesses, it might be a stretch, but just as in certain flood zones we've re-envisioned the design of buildings to live with occasional water where you don't want it (but can't easily stop it), we may need business models that can convert quickly from lock-up, to partial opening, to full opening, and back again, as needed. That way, the necessary public health decisions won't have to be so fiercely fought.
We'll also need many more government officials who value science, can look ahead, have a spine, can recognize and overcome mistakes, are secure enough to not have to always look certain and ""in charge,"" and value non-glamorous things like inter and intra-governmental communications.
If we don't do these things, including of course better prioritize public health, as these pandemics are not going away, we'll have to update our ""Jersey curses"" to better ""innoculate"" future public health professionals to what they'll be hearing.

2020-07-14 21:54:10,"I think it just goes back to culture. Cultures have their pluses and minuses. Americans have great work ethic and entrepreneurialism. But following the rules and reducing our consumption for the benefit of others? Not so much.

While the administration could’ve definitely done a better job, I think we would’ve had a huge problem no matter who was president."
2020-07-14 21:55:18,"Great analysis. I would have liked to see more comments on the quote from Tom Frieden that the base of the pyramid of public health is ""[s]ocial measures that mitigate economic inequality."" Normally the wealthy suffer less from the underfunding of public health than does the middle class, who in turn suffer less than the lower class (although no-one escapes the cost entirely - see ""The American Health Care Paradox""). Funding public health would require us to value our own lives and health more than we do our social status.   

I suspect the next pandemic will find us again unprepared and unwilling to do what we know works. But maybe being surrounded by people disabled by COVID-19 in the coming years will help us remember the cost, as knowing disabled polio survivors has helped me remember. Even though those lower down in the hierarchy are (as always) suffering the most, as in every epidemic we really are all in this together."

Together,  these are the steps that have been demonstrated to work in suppressing, and in some cases eliminating, the virus.  The US has simply not taken these measures in any sort of serious way any in many cases have done the exact opposite.  Thus, the virus will continue to spread there."

Although it may not be intentional, the president’s policies, or lack there of, is inexorably leading to the plan of herd immunity.

Testing is  inadequate, and we do not know the real extent of pandemic. 

As symptoms vary with age, health level, and socio-economic factors, more than the register 3 million+ may already exist.

If Americans failed to follow guidelines before, why do we expect them to change now?

Vaccine or no vaccine, Trump is determined to reopen for business as it is his best hope for re-election. Should the required % be reached to achieve herd immunity (placed from 70% to 90% infection), it is estimated that 1 million Americans will die.

I cannot help but believe that this would be acceptable to many of his followers."
2020-07-14 23:55:34,"Americans have been haggling about healthcare(with little or no resolution)since before Harry Truman was President.  If we put aside the obvious enormous ongoing lobbying and disinformation put forth by the private healthcare industry, the biggest problem by far in nothing changing is the majority of American voters continuing to NOT vote for candidates who will actually do something about it and that has always been the issue.

In the democratic primary,  healthcare, by far. was the most important issue on the agenda and voters stated quite clearly that the ""best man for the job"" was Bernie Sanders, yet, they ultimately chose Joe Biden as the democratic nominee, someone who stated quite clearly that if a universal healthcare bill passed by Congress came across his desk he would veto it!

Does anyone see the problem here, anyone?"
2020-07-15 00:24:17,"This is an excellent article and very well written. As a previous public health nurse (in Canada) I can attest to the fact that qualified public health nurses have been saving lives with patient education, preventative programs in areas of maternal child health, smoking cessation, AIDS education, teen pregnancy, diabetes education,  the list goes on and on. It is cost effective and operates to empower people to become informed and take control of their health. Covid-19 will respond to preventative public health measures. It can be controlled with education by qualified public health personnel out there helping citizens through education and teaching and support and complements the medical and clinical resources. Unfortunately community health programs lack the qualified public health registered nurses or hire less qualified people to do the jobs that should be done by qualified RN’s who have the requisite public health education and skills. I found it interesting that the article is about public health but most of the photos are of people in hospital. Public health is community based. Not hospital based. Contact racing is hard laborious work but it was instrumental in controlling STD ‘a, tuberculosis, smallpox and other diseases that ravaged entire towns cities and countries. We need to get back to basic, sound, effective public health principles."
2020-07-15 00:25:59,"It is a truism that the best treatment for a disease is not to get it in the first place.  Who is responsible for the epidemic of obesity, for diabetes, for many chronic diseases?  Public issues some health education addressing such issues.  Medical doctors in the sickness care system sometimes offer education and coaching followup but mostly it is pills, gastric bypass surgery, and onward from Obesity to diabetes, heart disease, and dementia.  Yes, each stage is a  partial cause of the other, and in the end, death!

Other causes include poor education, housing, and nutrition.  Most causal factors for this situation are in the control of, yes, you and me.  Public health budgets can double but they would not make much of a dent in the problems.  Why?  Our society has chosen personal physicians for their care and unfortunately, those physicians do not handle the prevention issues well.  Why?  The food system is outside their control.  Also, the quality of research on the issues is spare and NIH funding for it is nil.

So what should be done?  Unless the public health departments want to compete for rh role of the primary physician, forget it 
fund more research and pay for coaching and counseling to help individual cope."

Ignorance and Ignoring the virus is not going to get us out of this, it’s going to have be the health experts.   Now we going to open schools while ignoring the expansive and expensive CDC guidelines on the command  of someone,  who we had to be reminded that he knows how to read.

Our self immolation is poetic - we kill things. We are in the midst of our planet's 6th mass extinction - killing the bacteria and fungi and parasites that run the earth. By the way, viruses help to run the earth and are a foundation of our planet. We are bathed in quadrillions of them. We must stop our 'war' on nature and align ourselves with nature. This means subsidizing health food and clean air and water - rather than junk food and pills. Nobody ever got sick because of a lack of pills and chemo and pesticides.

I didn't say perfect guidance but the best we know at any given time is better than pretending everything is ok. 

I believe we are now seeing the catastrophic results from a collection of failures. Poor science, history and civics education, lack of empathy and concern for fellow human beings.

Yet they instituted a lockdown, a curfew, handwashing stations, and rigorous testing and contact tracing all over the country. From previous experience with TB and HIV and preparation for possible Ebola, they had cadres of community health workers that worked hard to inform people. Four months into the pandemic, in the most densely populated country in Africa, total cases in a country of 12 million are still under 1,500 with 4 deaths. Everyone wears masks and there is a 9 PM curfew. It has been hard and the main cause of cases is people coming from border countries with the virus. But I applaud them for self-discipline and community effort, which we seem to lack so severely."

Its not for lack of trying on public health's part, but the general public are not wearing masks or following social distancing. This is not a lack of knowledge, but a lack of will.  Precious resources have been diverted to COVID-19 and others, who lives are equally important, are dying as a result.  Today I witnessed a staff person break down in tears because there are simply not enough resources to help those in need. People need food, water, shelter and most importantly hope. 
The need to know they are valued as a human being. 
There is an old saying that epidemics reveal the best and the worst of society.  An objective assessment would say we're failing as a society.   We can do better!"

I have been a keen observer of the US over the years but have been dismayed at the level of ineptitude displayed by those you have chosen to lead you. I feel they are putting the economy before their own citizens, reopening early in an attempt to keep the economy viable (but at a huge cost) in the run up to November. People live in a community supported by an economy and it seems you elected officials have forgotten the community portion in their rush to reopen. Shame on them.

Your presidential election will be the most expensive in history both in monetary terms and in the lives of your own citizens because of the poor decision making of your elected officials. 

Not following expert advise will get you in trouble if your building a bridge, so why do your politicians think they can successfully ignore the advise of experts in the middle of a pandemic and get away with it? Hubris and possibly the Dunning Kruger effect?

It saddens me when I watch a great democracy put the safety and protection of it's own citizens behind the economy and the sitting presidents re-election chances.  

Keep safe. It appears from here that the ""land of the free""is broken."

With the exception of a few brave governors and local leaders, the Republican party has either actively engaged in endangering its own citizens, or stays silent while the corrupt and incompetent Trump administration denies and mismanages the epidemic.  

Let's not lose the forest through the trees.  We are losing this battle because the Republican party is in power.  That must change if we have any hope of winning the war."

2020-07-14 23:57:18,"We are not losing the battle against Covid-19. Here are  some positives.

1. Therapeutic treatments will arrive soon.  When someone contracts the novel coronavirus, his body’s immune system launches a defense, including producing antibodies that circulate in the blood to help identify infectious invaders. These circulating antibodies offer some protection against future infection. Scientists have now engineered clones of these antibodies and they are showing to be effective both therapeutically and to prevent infection. They work by attacking the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is how this virus gets into our cells. Stop that from happening, and the virus can’t replicate inside the body.

2.Rapid, low-cost saliva tests are coming that will allow 100% testing of the population.

3. More people are wearing masks. Even the man in the WH wore one the other day. More states and businesses are requiring them. Face shields are better.

4. Consensus has finally emerged that airborne spread is happening. Even the CDC and WHO have accepted this fact, albeit belatedly and reluctantly.

5. Past exposure to common-colds is playing a protective role for some people.  Studies show that 20 to 50 percent of people who had never been exposed to the novel coronavirus have immune cells — known as memory T cells — in their body that react to this new virus.  

6. Vaccine trials seem to be working and they could be available by October. 

7. More than 60% recover from Covid -19."

Despite his sometimes abrasive manner, Gov Cuomo payed each step day by day in his press briefings. What made Florida or California or Texas think they were special?

This is the first time in all these years that I regret my decision. I never thought that living in a red state like Texas would be anything more than inconvenient, it has now become life threatening.

We have made just about every single mistake a state can make about reopening, with a Governor lacking conviction and bending to the will of a few wealthy lobbyists.

Other states - heed this article and this warning.  Do what the medical advisors say and save lives.  Suffer the initial economic damage to stave off months and months of deaths and lock downs.

Abbott knows he failed.  You can see it on his face and hear it in his voice.  I don't think he is a bad person, just a bad leader.  He knows he let politics and lobbyists run the reopening and for a while he was relieved it was working.

But everything the health experts said has come true, and he has no one to blame but himself."

Probably that has something to do with the reality that Canadians tend to trust government more than Americans do, and that we tend to be more compliant, so that social distancing and mask-wearing have been more easily accepted here. There are many individual exceptions to these generalizations, but the exceptions constitute a lower proportion of the population than in the States. Can we credit this to the fact that Canada came into existence as an independent country without a revolution against authority? It seems plausible."

Thus there are two essential and separate steps in meeting a challenge: the generation of ideas and the imitation/adoption of those ideas by the majority. If either of those two processes ceases to function then the civilization breaks down.

The COVID-19 scenario was predicted in advance, and the US had contingency plans to prevent its spread.

Under ANY normal president, the US would have been working with China, allies, and international agencies last November and December, to prevent this pandemic from leaving China to begin with.

Instead, Trump fired all the planners, denied the science, and refused all collaboration.

Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Depression.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

2020-07-15 22:59:07,"People need to get used to the fact that Trump, his immediate sycophants, the people running him, and his followers are dead-set on their current path.  They won't change, either to take the proper approach to dealing with COVID-19 (or anything else), because overshadowing their incompetence, is the fact that they're deliberately operating according to an evolving plan that has, as one of its main goals, voter suppression in the upcoming elections, and the primaries for Congressional seats taking place until then.  The GOP's policy for decades has been to reduce some people's access to voting, and they think COVID-19 is a ""gift"" to accomplish more voter suppression.

They're successfully working to foster the attitude among Trump followers that going out as usual is OK, leading to the increase in infections, illnesses, deaths, etc. that we see, because increasing the number of infections maintains the conditions which will keep many people who aren't Trump followers away from the polls, while maximizing the number of Trump followers who will be willing to go to the polls.  This is why Trump and his people are dead-set against mail-in ballots.

They figure if their goal requires ""a few"" tens of thousands more people to die than otherwise would have happened, or even several hundred thousand, they're fine with that.

If we had examined the public health responses of Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- all refined by earlier experiences with viral outbreaks from China -- we would have had a clear and simple prescription of what we should have done.  They blocked flights, began contact tracing, and instituted controls and mandatory masks in public almost immediately.  Now all those countries together have 2 percent of the cases in Texas.

If you are older, suffer from chronic disease or have no health insurance, you already know what to do to keep yourself protected; masks, gloves & frequent hand-washing & limited trips out in public. By now, you don’t need “permission” from any person or agency to know it’s what you HAVE to do to protect yourself. Listening to the ridiculousness coming daily from the White House; the spontaneous decisions & the walking back from them a few days later. What kind of leadership IS this?

Factually speaking, it's not. Backwards public health is just one symptom, along with 19th century gun laws, racist police, overly complicated tax system... the list goes on.

If a national health care was the answer what happened to Europe?  So stop breading anger and hate and report the facts and not your opinion.

The issue is Americans do not like government telling them what to do.  We have COVIDiots who just want to rebel.  I do not understand that mentality to fight wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing.  

They will only understand when someone close to them has a serious reaction or sadly dies.

Yes we need better funded healthcare, but to base such funding would have solved the pandemic or helped people wear masks or keep to social distancing is not ethical.  It just breeds violent anger."

The problem lies  not only with our  president who lost his moral compass decades ago but also with his opposition led by self aggrandizing practically stupid individuals like Pelosi and Schiff who put their own attainment of political power way above the welfare of this country also decades ago.  

So the country with the highest priced health care in the world is now having the highest rate of coronavirus infections and deaths of any country in the world.  Doesn't seem fair, does it? Why is it this way?  Look at our failed Leadership (including their lost moral compass, their faltering allegiance to the USA, their mediocre intelligence, and their poor ability to deal with complex physical, biologic and social problems)  and you will see the reasons for our current failure.

2020-07-17 18:26:37,"I am a retired physician and past county health officer in California.  Thank you for you excellent article.  Taiwan is a great example of a country that has managed the pandemic well.  They have had 7 deaths and 400 cases.  They have a national health service and a culture that responds to public health directives, particularly wearing masks.  With unified leadership and a well-funded health apparatus, they have success.  Their population is 23 million whereas Texas has 28 million.  They are an island, but they are geographically very close to China.  They learned from past epidemics and planned accordingly.

Can we please learn from this pandemic so we at least can plan for the next one after this one is finally, and hopefully, conquered."

Health care providers work for us, we respect them for it, we are loyal to them and angry when political and corporate agendas muck things up.

2020-07-19 13:53:27,"The article is an excellent overview of US public health history, but documents public sickness more than public health. A person's health is largely determined by nutrition, and the AMA has abandoned its post to Big Ag and Big Pharma in recent decades. 

The food guidelines 'pyramid' has promoted highly refined grains and sugars that have left most Americans facing obesity and type 2 diabetes, these being the 'underlying conditions' cited in nursing home deaths. Ketchup in school lunch programs is categorized as a 'vegetable'. 

The media ignores the fact that mortality for those under the age of 70 are no higher than for bad flu seasons of the recent past. Scientists are warning that the poverty that prolonged lock downs exacerbate is beginning to account for the apparent rise in deaths. 

At the same time poverty alone among people of color is seen as the cause of their higher death toll, whereas the biologists point out that skin pigmentation is a larger factor, toward avoiding a deep deficiency in vitamin D, our central hormone critical to resisting upper respiratory infections. 

The majority of American are deficient, and deserve to know about it.

Nutrition underlies all public health, and public sickness policy will always be held hostage by the factory foods industry, until it is rationalized outside the influence of Washington lobbyists."
2020-07-19 14:13:37,"But public health has also missed the boat on prevention. Our entire system is based on the war that Pasteur began when he showed a small invisible microbe as causing our disease. We have progressed to the point that we realize the resistance to our antimicrobials that the war has wrought. But we have not gone back to look at Claude Bernard, Pasteur's contemporary and foil, who argued that the ""soil"", i.e. where the microbe was planted and the defenses they had by virtue of natural selection, were just as important. Those defenses make us healthier but no one is looking at them or how to make them work better. That is a role for Public Health, but in order to do it they need to get their orders from someone other than the generals running the war."
2020-07-19 15:59:57,"Americans have been conditioned for decades to judge the nation's health solely on the basis of the economy. How healthy we are, how well-educated we are or how happy we are have become secondary at best. The results of that mind-set are perfectly portrayed in this article. 

How politicians and elected officials interfere with our health is now on vivid display both in Texas and across the country. The lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, recently said in an interview that were more important things than living. That should alarm both Texans and Americans as a whole. And just yesterday, the Trump Administration made known that it will not support any more federal money be spent  for virus testing and contact-tracing. That should alarm us all even more."
2020-07-19 16:14:36,"When I was in Nurses training in the early 70s public health was one of our major studies. I still have my copy of “Eleven Blue Men” a series of stories describing the search for patient X and the etiology and spread of many odd diseases in the US (one was leprosy well after that had been eradicated from the developed world. 
Sadly the need for this specialty has become what Washington considers a drain on our resources. However, with a country as large as ours with no guaranteed preventative health care for all, it has become so much more important. 
Enter Corona virus. We know where it started, we know how it is spread but, we are still trying to learn the terrible harm it can cause. Our government has stripped the CDC and the FDA of funds, and call them frauds. Our hospitals are underfunded and understaffed. 
Sorry, we are not the best country in the world. I still love being an American but I cry for our future daily."
2020-07-19 18:12:23,"Now that is a great article. What I think is missing, if we're going to start talking money, is the greed of American hospitals (and doctors, and health insurers). 

Last economic crash, we had to bail out banks. Not the people going bankrupt, the banks that could no longer earn money off the back of the foreclosing People. In this health crisis, we have to bail out hospitals. Because American hospitals are collectively losing BILLIONS of dollars, every month, since the beginning of the crisis.

Now, I would be naive if I thought this health crisis will expose the real issue, which is how hospital are businesses disguised as non profit organizations, and change the future.
But I still think that American hospitals and doctors have been making millions for too long. Where is the money? Why can't they buy PPE, why do they spend all their cash rather than saving some for future expenses? 

Why everybody constantly whines about big pharma (who are upfront about being companies selling products) and nobody says anything about the health system exploiting peopledistress, is beyond me.

Sure we need universal coverage and social benefits etc etc. But let's be real, it won't work unless we start regulating health prices."
2020-07-19 23:41:24,"unfortunately, the lack of care for others, or rather human inability to process that at the family/friend level the meaning of care for others has changed, was a major factor in Houston (Harris County's major city).  Gov. Abbott interceded, as noted in this article, and lifted restrictions on smaller gatherings May 15. Already the afternoon of May 14, there were multiple small and large get-togethers/parties in  my neighborhood, all maskless. Crowded small parties continued every weekend until late June. ."

2020-07-19 13:08:06,"I like easy test questions. We're losing this battle because Trump is calling the shots.  He now opposes a Senate proposal for additional billions of dollars for coronavirus testing and tracing.  He opposes virus testing.  Let that sink in.  Afraid the increasing infection rate makes HIM look bad. 
The only way to open the schools, and the economy in general, is to have rapid testing.   

He refuses to mandate mask wearing.  He says he wants people to have 'freedom.'  Freedom to die, freedom to infect?  All of the anti-maskers get their marching orders from him, directly or indirectly.  His press agents, Fox opinionators, spread Trump's destructive message.  

Republican Senators who proposed the additional funds for coronavirus testing and tracing are silent.  They are willing to put their constituents lives and livelihoods on the line in obeisance to their party leader.  Only Trump doesn't lead.  He promotes preconceived ideas and is rarely capable of modifying them based on facts.  If he was an anti-Vaxxer, he'd probably oppose a coronavirus vaccine.

Our hands at our jobs are tied by local, state and federal politicians.

I have a background in infection control and bioterrorism. My word at the table is constantly squashed by the overhead of politicians making daily decisions on what we do in our jobs and how to protect the public. I do 5 jobs in one title because of the lack of staffing.   Its a very frustrating duty when you want to help prevent deaths and you see the country crumbling at the hands of politicians."
2020-07-14 11:45:41,"Directly above this is a piece about the virus’s spread through the Rio Grande valley. 

How did it spread there? By families who ignored the risks, and who selfishly and stupidly stuck to their traditions of “pachamgas,” or large family gatherings, and their culture of telling themselves that “nothing bad will happen.” 

Spend all you want on public health. But at the end of the day, the public’s health depends on millions of private decisions. When these decision makers aren’t the sharpest knives in the drawer, we’re going to see rapid and broad spread. And to the degree that there are disparities in intelligence between population groups, we’re going to see disparate impact where disease spread is concerned. Just like we see with school performance, earnings and homeownership rates, family stability measures like the prevalence of single motherhood, and yes - the rate at which violent crime is committed and the incarceration rate. 

The sooner we acknowledge this, and apply authoritarian measures to help the less intelligent amongst us protect themselves from their own bad choices, the sooner we’ll beat this pandemic. Europe is doing much better. So are the societies of East Asia. Unlike them, we are far more diverse. While our Euro and East Asian descended populations have COVID rates on par with their counterparts in Europe and East Asia, it’s our minority populations that need the help. This is a crisis. It’s time to really help them. Stronger approaches are needed."

We are being led by politicians that don’t understand the severity of the virus 

I wrote many opinions saying to shut down the whole US on February first. All I got was criticism . We can still save another 150,000 by shutting down fir at least 6 weeks. End of lesson. 

The virus will change shape every year for it is not a natural virus. This virus is related to the virus that killed 150 million pigs about 11 months ago in China. Scientusts modified that dusease with bats in studies and unfortunately it was released.

Go back to when Trump took office & dismantled US biodefenses in face of  warnings that it would expose Americans to the ""significant probability of a lethal pandemic,"" we'd pay  with high human and economic costs. He cut DHHS & CDC funding, disbanded entire pandemic response team. Trump abandoned historic fed role. 2009 H1N1 influenza triggered largest federal distribution of protective gear to states. Yet Trump told states federal government ""not a shipping clerk."" i.e., an  abdication of responsibility. DPA authorizes president to force production and distribution of needed gear b/c its president's Job. 
Obama got world leaders to stop Ebola by sending 10,000 team to W. Africa, prepared US for outbreak. Only 11 cases,2 deaths in US. Trump trashed US 70-yr leading role fighting diseases. including Ebola, tuberculosis, malaria, yellow fever, AIDS, avian influenza and Zika. Failing as leader, Trump turned to misinformation that led more Americans to eschew caution and experience more infection and death. 
Involuntary or negligent manslaughter encompasses unintended killing through negligence, as well as knowledge that actions pose risk to life. Irresponsible actions or failure to perform a duty can constitute the crime. Do Trump's actions and omissions rise to that level? Ask the families of the 142,000 Americans who have died.

2020-07-19 18:35:58,"As a Houston resident, I give our leaders credit for doing a few things right, among them canceling large gatherings (like the rodeo and the Republican State Convention, both of which would have brought large numbers of non-Harris County residents into the city).

I also think there is blame for our local electeds. Rather than really trying to work with Gov Abbott, both Judge Hidalgo and Mayor Turner (both Democrats) have harangued him recently about a “two week closure” which he’s discounted. And Gov Abbott is right. If Harris County “closes” and the next county over is “open” how is that fair to the barber or the baker here that I can drive 20 minutes and get the service I need? And, such closures mean white collar workers stay home, but not the trash hauler, the bus driver or the city or county employee. 

Also, for having two high ranking elected leaders of color — Hidalgo and Turner — our biggest “spikes” have been in communities of color. An article in the local paper said “those communities aren’t getting the message”. Well, why not? Rather than Judge Hidalgo trying to make Gov Abbott look bad is she not in those communities saying, “something’s gotta give”? 

I appreciate the hard work of our public health sector and they are notoriously underfunded and, sadly, that won’t change any time soon. Not with candidates of both parties declaring a “War on Cancer” rather than a “war on being unhealthy”"

The man is dangerous and deluded. If babbling incoherently was an olympic sport he would be taking the podium. 
726 cases in the UK today, 27 lost souls, nothing linked to over testing or cases of the sniffles!
You know things are on the up here when the main news headlines are about Chinese conspiracy theories, Bozza and Keir are back to girly fighting again, we are probably going to get another drubbing from the West Indies at cricket, and yay, Lewis Hamilton won again. The new normal is here, it was hard won. Not looking forward to winter and possible resurgence of the virus, but determined to stay optimistic.

An examination of Universal Health Care in any one of the many advanced countries that offer it would provide the first lesson for Americans about this concept.

I do not mean New York Times examination but rather systematic well funded research by American researchers who study how UHC works, one country at a time. 

Both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would have benefited if such research giving an overview country by country had been availabele.

I do not have any hope that Joe Biden on his own will have the energy and knowledge to press for UHC lets say in the 2d 2 years. A Vice President who does have such is what we need.

Here a footnote I now regularly add: I work for Swedish Ob-Gyn researchers who are studying the possibility of bringing the single most important element of UHC to one or more Sub-Sahatan African countries - Bill and Linda Gates Foundation funds work focused on this goal.The element: Universal and free 1000 days of pre, peri, and post-natal care for every mother-child combination. Perhaps the Gates duo should support such for backwards America.

There are all kinds of problems in that statement: Private liberty, as if that is possible. Individual freedom is only  possible in a community that works together to achieve common goals. This word ""liberty"" is a political weapon that each person can interpret their own way- liberty to walk safely, vs liberty to own the gun and pull it out in public. Liberty to speak out vs. deciding what speech is perceived is harmful. It seems that humanity has not yet learned that individuals will still mostly work for their own interests versus work to figure out the common interests of their community. This country (and in this case, Texas in particular) is losing out in many ways to the self interests of politicians, business men, and our administration. Be it in the area of health, social justice, health care, etc., Younger people are beginning to wake up to that. Better get out the vote folks (in person, or by mail)."
2020-07-21 22:43:17,The same sorts that reject public health rules also reject public health spending. Politicians holding these views need to be voted out.
2020-07-21 23:39:32,"Even before covid19 found its way into the USA, for years before that time, as a Registered Nurse I was alarmed at the number of people who could just enter the country without immunizations and blend into the country.
Public health was a focus of every parent’s responsibility in the past.
People with STDs and tuberculosis were quarantined and forced to treatment and their contacts were traced by our local health departments. 
There has been a profound breakdown of public health responsibilities in the past few decades; public health fell of the cliff; as a kid, I recall the terror we faced at the possibility of contracting polio and even as a kid I was so grateful for the Salk and the Sabin vaccines. 
There has been a failure at all levels of government for investment in public health.
Hard to find someone who cares about such things anymore."
2020-07-21 19:58:54,"The US is losing the battle with C19 because it is the US - i.e., the ideology it has promoted and forced on much of the rest of the world for the past century has carried through to its logical conclusion - a breakdown of the ability of a society to function as a society. The radical individualism foundational to and exacerbated by the radical American form of capitalism is inherently sociopathic. When you combine this with the social divisions, mostly built around race, that have been deliberately amplified by the Republican Party, you get a country that is incapable of governing itself. I certainly hope that American allies -most of whom desperately want a return to ""normal"" and who have deluded themselves about the extent of American collapse- come to their senses and realize with what they are dealing. Watching Britain kowtow to the US war on China is a fascinating example of a UK govt that has messed up so badly in so many ways that it must genuflect before Trump. But it may well have misread the situation and the longevity of the US."
2020-07-22 05:11:23,"Thank you for making clear the high level of idiocy and ignorance we have in the highest political offices in Texas.
The Governor, eager to get the dollars going; the Lt Governor Patrick, a loose cannon and crazy barking dog and even the AG, Paxton, who declared good laws and norms illegal and is still trying to skate from a  previous criminal charge, all seem to blindly follow the willfully ignorant WH occupant no matter how little sense he shows.

How much damage is done to the state and the nation by these clowns will probably remain untold.
All we can do is mourn the unnecessary deaths of Americans due to the stubborn negating forces and stupidity  of the present GOP leadership at all levels."
2020-07-26 13:22:19,"We can use a strong interpretation of States' rights to protect ourselves.  If you don't live in a state that is managing the  pandemic , move; if you live in a well managed state support strong  exclusion laws to keep out people who present a danger to your safety."
2020-07-26 14:48:51,"July 20th was the 6 month anniversary for when the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the U.S. If one assumes, after an incubation period of 7 days, that single person infected a second person , who then infected another person etc., by the end of 6 months there would be 67,108,864 infected people. That is the worst case scenario of what one is dealing when an infection is spread in an exponential manner with an ""R naught"" of 0. It does not account for the existence of  other infected individuals on that date. 

If we do nothing else before a vaccine is available, the least we can do is to wear a face mask, practice social distancing, and not to go out unless necessary. Such measures do in fact work, as evidenced by the results obtained in NY and in some of the other northeastern States.  In the absence of adequate testing, personal protective equipment, hospital beds, ventilators etc., hospital admissions were brought to pre-covid 19 levels within 4-5  weeks with good leadership that encouraged the public to adopt such measures. Is that too great of a sacrifice to make in view of the results likely to be obtained?"
2020-07-26 11:51:46,"We're losing the battle because we're a country chock full of entitled, ignorant, self-absorbed child-people who are too stupid to get out of their own way.

Every single utterance of ""I don't wanna wear a mask & I don't have to"", ""I don't wanna stop going to restaurants, bars, & parties, & I don't have to"", & ""I have my rights & you can't take them away"", gives the virus yet another boost.

Grow up people, & then maybe we can survive this."

-19 is the magnifying glass of most of the American forthcomings : Healthcare, 18th century Simplistic political philosophy in a time of globalization and highly complex societies, an electoral system fraught with deficiencies and inequality / unfairness potential, a judicial system with minimal responses besides long time jail sentences, a public schooling system so weak US technology preeminence stems as much from foreign brains than american ones, an inability of the political system to make place for common interest vs. private / individualistic exigencies, etc… etc… 

It seems that America hasn't solved the great challenges that other western democracies came to terms with : in this respect (like in many others) USA is akin to a  ""Conservatory of Europe""…"
2020-07-30 01:48:21,"Why can’t we manage to respond to this coronavirus challenge in any competent or coherent way? Why can’t we respond in a way that is, at a minimum, on a par with other developed nations? Why, why, why? 
There is now a large body of Americans who actually can’t respond in a competent and coherent way. When large segments of the American population refuse to follow any guidelines of physical distancing, behavior, or mask wearing, there is a basic reason. They just can’t. They can’t bring themselves to follow directions. They can’t bring themselves to believe there are any consequences to their actions. They can’t bring themselves to believe they have any responsibility or duty to their fellow Americans. But the question is: Why are so many Americans living in this state of mind?
After decades hearing the extolling of the self and self-aggrandizement, including in-your-face examples for the public that nobody of wealth or connections ever pays consequences for actions, can Americans realistically be expected to have the physical and emotional capability to recognize a greater good, any authority, or any knowledge greater than their own experience, let alone have the discipline to follow directions or guidance even if accepting that a problem exists? The evidence indicates not. What we see in these scenes around the country of heedless and dangerous activity is what our America has become in 2020, an America that just “can’t”."
2020-07-30 17:09:09,"The bold truth of the matter is the USA deserves this pandemic.

Our conduct and leaders brought this to fore. 

Shame on America."
2020-08-13 18:12:31,"I live in the border region of South Texas, which is in even worse shape than Houston.  Our county judge and US Representative have tried to fight back against Abbott's idiocy, earning my gratitude and respect.  Judge Cortez has instituted a lockdown, even though it is technically unenforceable because of the governor's actions.  We now have a medical school here, and without it we wouldn't have had the testing or scientific leadership we have had.  If Abbott had left us alone, we could have maintained the health of our community, as we were doing with an earlier lockdown.  But now there is a tremendous death toll and cautious people will not even leave the house.  Were it not for the help of charities and the military, things would be even worse.

In my book, Abbott and Trump and their minions qualify as mass murderers and should be held accountable, just as mass murderers were at Nuremberg."
