A competent CDC is vital to our nation.  We missed so many important opportunities right from the beginning.  Every missed  opportunity is for virus to spread further and kill more.  People and economy are the collateral damages to this missed opportunities to stopping the virus.  If the virus is still spreading, no business will have the confidence to open 100%.  In addition, no school is bold enough to open classrooms to resume teaching.  And no parent is willing to put their kids in school at risks.

And our president is no help at all.  He only wants to take credit for everything.  But he doesn't want to take any responsibility for anything. He probably is the worst president since WWII.  I hope our luck will turn in November."

And Jeff, never one to miss a Golden Opportunity, will trundle Donald ""Space Faorce"" Trump out to the Blue Origins launch pad and give Very Stable Genius the honor of being the first permanent resident of Mars.

Which, I think we all agree, he should certainly be allowed to DOMINATE.

Along with the immediate pain that can cause watering eyes and burning throats, tear gas may cause damage to people’s lungs and make them more susceptible to getting a respiratory illness, according to studies on the risks of exposure. The gas can also incite coughing, which can further spread the virus from an infected person.

Influenza mutates very rapidly, which is why there is a new vaccine every year, and even that is only effective in some cases. Measles, on the other hand, mutates slowly, so a vaccination is more-or-less- good forever.

In addition, it is not yet clear if there are already multiple strains of the virus already circulating in the population, strains which might require different or multi-strain vaccines.

With Trump in the White House I am sure that its long-term safety is not of the greatest concern. The vaccine will be rushed through the approval process, by executive order if necessary. The objective is to show the voting public that the vaccine is effective against contracting Covid-19 and that only Trump can guarantee its proper implementation and therefore should be reelected.

Most certainly, law abiding citizens expect Trump to  initially receive a huge monetary benefit, ""some of which"" to be dispersed as bonuses to his own like crooks.

In the end, with only under 2/3 a year remaining in his dangerous & disastrous term for law abiding Americans, those Americans along with all who have suffered with COVID-19, or knowing one who has, or worse, even perished; are in fear that the company they finally select will not likely be the one having the best vaccine to benefit their health sufficiently."

After taking it for a few months it did seem to help my RA, but it also brought about such severe side effects that I was taken off of it once we all figured out what was causing my symptoms, which included recurring and alarming drops in blood pressure in which I nearly passed out, stomach pain and elevated liver enzymes that alarmed my PCP and gastroenterologist.

For someone who has an underlying medical condition, and many people have something -- ranging from mild to serious, a reaction like this extremely dangerous on top of COVID-19 symptoms. As well, many people do not even know if they have an underlying medical!

The study does not rule out hydroxychloroquine effect by any means.  

For example, the hydroxychloroquine did show a trend for patients to benefit from the drug (12% got the disease on the drug vs. 14% on placebo).  This was not statistically significant, but there are reasons why the design of the study could have muted any statistical significance.  That reason is that patients were not actually diagnosed with standard testing, as many were enrolled prior to standard coronavirus testing availability.  So many people may not have had the disease who got either drug or placebo; this would diminish any statistical effects.

Interestingly, ""the study did not see a significant increase in disturbances of heart rhythms, or an imbalance of deaths"" unlike recent claims in the media based upon observational data.

If true (and the matter is still under intensive investigation) it would represent the biggest science fraud in research history.

The Lancet has flagged an 'Expression of Concern' over the paper - a step on the retraction road. And, right now, the jury is still very much back out, retired still, on whether hydroxychloroquine is of value in patients gravely ill with Covid-19.

The entire idea that Hydroxychloroquine (HC) could be effective against Covid19 is based on a FALSE PREMISE. 
It was based on the biology of SARS-Cov1, which causes SARS. 
HC blocks the ENDOCYTOSIS-mediated entry of SARS-Cov1 into cells, after binding of the viral ""spike protein"" to the ACE2 receptor on human cells. 

SARS-Cov2 has an separate mode of entry. This alternative path depends on a preparatory proteolytic cleavage of the viral ""Spike"" protein, which, in collaboration with the serine protease TMPRSS2, enables the virus membrane to directly fuse with the cell membrane. 

This mechanism does NOT use the endocytosis route, giving the viral RNA access to the cell that can not be influenced by the HC effect on endocytosis. SARS-Cov1 does not have the protease enzyme necessary to activate the Spike protein, making it sensitive to HC, in contrast to SARS-Cov2.

To further muddy the situation, the vast majority of tissue culture-based work on SARS-Cov2 is being performed on Vero cells, a monkey cell line that does NOT contain TMPRSS2, making it a bad model for SARS-Cov2 cell infection assays. A recent paper suggesting HC decreases SARS-Cov2 cell infection uses - you guessed it - Vero cells.

All physicians know that prescribing any medicine necessarily entails risk and that to do so when there is no rational expectation of benefit is reckless and irresponsible.

Also, old people stayed home and did not get sick with the usual things — they didn’t get the usual cold and flu viruses, because they were isolated from those too,  they were less likely to get dehydrated , fewer other infections. 
With the state “opening up “ and the nicer weather we are seeing the usual illnesses again."
2020-06-04 10:20:15,"My response to this is that the visits dropped because the people typically didn’t have a health problem serious enough to go to the ER to begin with. Previously they would go for a common cold or minor cut because they weren’t going to pay the bill anyway, either because they had insurance or they didn’t have insurance. Then the minor health issues got outweighed by the possibility of Covid. They will he back because Americans don’t know how to holistically care for themselves."
2020-06-04 07:32:15,"9 nights of looting and no social distancing. And yet there are no bodies stacked in the streets like cord wood and no run on the hospitals. At what point do we acknowledge that the virus infects many but only a very few get sick and even fewer die? Those who were going to get sick or die probably did already. The pandemic is over. This is now just another virus, like the flu that we will live with. Protect the elderly and especially the nursing homes. But the looting is as much from the damage caused by endless lockdowns as from a horrendous murder by police. When will we actually follow the science and end this nightmare so we can try to get back to some semblance of normalcy? Oh right, we can't, because any day now thousands will start dropping dead. Any day."

2020-06-08 14:00:28,"This situation is tragic, but the story is not limited to covid-19 and is probably familiar to anyone who has had a family member living at a nursing home in the US.
My mother-in-law lived for several years in a well-respected nursing home in Cincinnati, one of the nicest in the area that would accept a Medicaid patient (but only after paying out-of-pocket for a year). She suffered from dementia and had frequent UTIs--these were usually only diagnosed and treated after we brought it to the attention of staff, often requiring multiple requests before action was taken. Each UTI left her more infirm, worsening her dementia and mobility.
We were unable to care for her ourselves and could not afford another home in town, and this was (sadly) one of the best available. 
There is a national crisis in elder care, which covid-19 has brought to our attention but did not cause. The staff at nursing homes are poorly paid (I once overheard an aide complaining that she would be better off collecting welfare) yet many are run by for-profit companies. What can anyone expect when we allow the profit motive to compete with quality of care? Is this the best America can do for its senior citizens? Considering that some politicians think seniors should give their lives for the economy, I'm afraid the answer might be yes. We must do better."
2020-06-08 14:15:04,"My mother-in-law, who lived on the nursing care floor of a highly rated, not-for-profit, continuing care retirement community in suburban Philadelphia, died on 4/15. Tests for coronavirus were inconclusive, but her symptoms were consistent with Covid-19. No family member had seen her since 3/6, when a strict quarantine was implemented at the facility.

Other than one conversation with the MD, all other communication was with nurses, and was very scattershot. The only visual contact was one Skype call, which was extremely hard to arrange, when she was on morphine and unconscious. 

From the information in this article, it doesn’t sound like the care in the Burlington facility was necessarily worse, and the communication and transparency was certainly better.  The rates of infection and death seem comparable with our experience.

Our family is left with many unknowns and ambiguities. No one visited her while she was sick, and no one saw her body before she was cremated. It’s as if she just disappeared. Perhaps her body was also left outside for the undertakers... Did the staff have access to and properly use PPE? We’ll never know. At the time we were overwhelmed by the dire circumstances, and trusted the staff to do their best.

It is clear now that the crisis in nursing homes caused by this coronavirus was worsened by problems that already existed in even the best of these facilities. Most importantly, the staff needs to be better educated, better paid and better supported."
2020-06-08 14:31:37,"There is simply no way that nursing homes on their own could have compensated for the lack of federal support for testing.  This isn't to excuse cases of true negligence, but the federal government should have been implementing systematic testing protocols and ensuring the availability of PPE in every nursing home, but especially in any home where a positive case had been reported.  My sister works in a similar setting.  She was exposed to the virus from a co-worker and she was not able to get tested until she exhibited symptoms and was told to come to work in the meantime (she is essential).  Her employer was unable to get her tested because the CDC and local public health guidelines were essentially rationing tests. Even now it can be hard to get tested in many communities.  This is a tragedy but fining nursing homes will  not keep this from happening ""the next time,"" whenever that may be."
2020-06-08 15:34:19,"This is all very tragic and the impacts downstream will involve hospitals as well.

I work for a hospital system and since visitation has been severely restricted and masks required for staff and visitors, nosocomial infections have dropped at every hospital in the system. I do not see hospital visitation returning to the way it was before COVID-19."
2020-06-08 16:01:26,"I find articles like this one very exhausting.

Back in the 1980s, I worked as a nursing assistant in what would now be considered an assisted living facility. I was fortunate to work my way through school and earn a PhD with a specialization in gerontology.

This story is not new although the circumstances are exacerbated by coronavirus. Until we, as a society, decide to prioritize care of the elderly and recruit qualified professionals, as well as pay them adequately, this story will not change. There is no reason for CEOs to earn millions while the front line workers make minimum wage."
2020-06-08 16:39:20,"Great piece. It would be good to see further analysis comparing the normal rate of death in nursing homes, With a median survival rate of only five months, according to CDC data, and the death rates from those who tested positive for coronavirus, the numbers in this piece suggest that 11 deaths out of 90 in a two month period is actually lower than what would happen during any normal period. With a five month median life expectancy for most nursing home residents, a population of 90 would yield around 18 deaths during a two month period.So 11 out of 90 is a “negative excess deaths” figure rather than a positive figure."
2020-06-08 17:43:32,"Glad the NYT is keeping the subject of substandard nursing homes going. Some for profit facilities are run better than some non for profit, where the alleged no profit means large bonuses for management, but not better care for patients. Everything goes into the hopper.
Of course the entire industry needs to be re-examined, and while profit isn't a sin, making millions on homes with poor ratings is grossly unethical. Unfortunately, much of the blame rests on local and state government, who look the other way because of hefty election contributions, and who knows what slips under the table. Fines are kept to a minimum and never deter the owners from refusing to substantially improving things. Staffing is below normal in these poorly run facilities, pay is dismal, turnover is rampant.
I hear there are some owners who actually pay better, so that morale is boosted, commitment to staying on the job improves, as well as work performance. In the long term, this is actually cheaper, and much smarter. But, there still needs to be workable ratios of staff to patients implemented. Despite the CMS star ratings, much more work needs to be done to improve care."

Well, if I know anything, I know this: it is who hears the cries of the very poor, the very lost, the alone and terrified, that entity can be trusted to hold power and serve the people. 
Articles like this one show that the Times is willing to take the time to listen to the suffering of the poor and alone. It is painful to understand that some nursing homes function as the proverbial ice floes did, places to put the old and weak.
Does any nation do nursing homes well? If so, could the Times run a piece on that, for it really does feel like we are left with a system here in this country of deliberate capitalistic ""uncaring"".  
If we had a national health service with a mandate under the law to take care of the old and the sick, taking to the courts would be an option, but of course, we don't.

Even from the FIRST reports from Wuhan, Covid-19 was KNOWN to be a killer of the old and frail and not particularly dangerous to the young and healthy.

The CDC and state health authority's response to Covid-19 was ethnocentric, unscientific and a complete failure to see the virus for what is WAS and not what they FEARED it might be.  

If the FIRST order from the CDC in February would have been to isolate nursing homes and encouraging those over 80 or over 65 with pre-existing heath conditions to self-quarantine, so many lives might have been saved.

I don't blame these homes for doing what they were told to do and not understanding the threat of Covid-19 when the authorities who - theoretically - had knowledge and information failed to act on it."

I'm beyond disgusted with the lack of oversight in these facilities. 
So many of seniors are discovered in these facilities, sick, alone, severe bedsores, dehydrated and stewing in their own, filthy unchanged diapers. How many of them were NEVER discovered before they died a miserable death, which they didn't deserve, while having their bank accounts robbed for care?

If you look at 'who' owns these facilities, you will find them all buried under LLCs that are protected from litigation with caps on negligent and abusive care.  Many 'investors' are foreign.  

Why do they invest?  It's a guaranteed payoff!  The government guarantees the investment and income via Medicaid, and no one can really be sued to the extent that they feel any pain whatsoever.   

The ignorance that the public have, and the government ignores, is astounding."
2020-06-08 14:43:29,"Nothing has changed for the better in the nursing home industry in decades—and we see how the coronavirus has been able to spread in these facilities as a result.    DHHS at the federal level, and CMS, and GOP-led state or national governing don’t much care—too much money sloshing around supporting the political class.

One thought, however:   Try to stick with nonprofit skilled nursing homes if possible.   The for-profit chains are generally unwilling to provide adequate, let alone superior, care and services:  by definition their aims are all tied to profits and high salaries for corporate leaders, and only a pittance to staff and hands-on caregivers. 

And insofar as possible:   Have family or friends visit often and unannounced.   Record and report any problems to the facility but also to regulatory agencies or, perhaps, even local news outlets, and take photos of anything worrisome about the resident.  If the family member has complaints, videotape him or her telling about the problem.

Sounds awful to need to take such steps, but the conditions are sufficiently questionable in these facilities that call for vigilance and actions on the part of family and friends for their loved ones who are essentially at the mercy of these institutions ."

I cannot tell you how often my claims and symptoms described have gone untreated and dismissed as if I was fabricating, exaggerating or hallucination the information.

Except for our physician who has been a personal and close friend of ours for years, I never trust the other people I speak with to treat me when he is unavailable due to a vacation.  I fear when he retires I will become completely invisible to any medical person I see for help.

It feels as if medical professionals don't know how to listen anymore because they are preoccupied with the  laptops or iPhones.  If a person even looks at me when asking a question is an unusual occurrence.

Most nursing homes in this country are for profit facilities, and all of them strictly limit the number of beds allocated to a Medicaid patient. Someone posting here quoted a statistic saying the average stay in a nursing home was 5 months – maybe for temporary ""respite and rehab"" but for other illnesses like Alzheimer's and other complicated care needs, patients live for years in those facilities. (Average lifespan of an Alzheimer's patient is ten years.) Care costs and board run into thousands of dollars a month, tethered as they are to an a la carte care need model (incontinence care is very expensive and is often terribly inadequate in facilities because of the poor staff to patient ratios.It is also a common source of infection transmission. Did the provider change their gloves between patients? Did they change their gloves after cleansing and before application of any medical ointment: containers of ointment/medicines can get contaminated.)Proper elder care requires a lot of attention, and the federal/state standards for patient to staff ratios are inadequate, as are regular inspections of facilities.

Of course, Covid rampaged through a building full of vulnerable people. The article addressed that these people are parents and loved ones. Not everyone gets to die at home as my mother did.

One Arizona nursing home staff stands out as a pillar of strength and courage.  The minute they realized the toll the virus was taking on elders like theirs they all moved into the home for 65 days and took every precaution to prevent the virus from even getting into their facility.

Full stop.  It is the governments failure to give adequate direction; CDC guidelines to test those with symptoms or travel history miss the 25 % of patients without symptoms or fever.  The governments failure to provide adequate testing, which experts suggest is > 5 million tests a day vs the 600,000 done daily now.  Last the structure of group care.  The elders when sick have a 50% chance of hospitalization, 25% chance of ICU admission, where 9/10 die.  Like the cruise ships, and the Navy ship, the structure of close quarters leads to infection.  The cure is to have universal testing every 2 weeks, (staff and patients) to find positives, isolate them ( which requires paid sick leave and health insurance), track contacts.  In my patient's facility, that was not possible until the outbreak and 10/76 patients died (14%) then the expensive contract medical swat team came in- I would much prefer those millions spent used for extensive testing and bolstering the public health departments with computers and manpower to stop this plague.

More generally, it seems that there are about 2 million patients in nursing homes in the U.S. and about 1 million of them will die every year.

Walker passed away over the weekend after a long-term illness and complications from COVID-19.  Mr. Walker founded Genesis in 1985 and was Chairman and Chief Executive from 1985 to 2002.  He was instrumental in the development and growth of the skilled nursing industry, as we know it today."
2020-06-08 19:13:12,"I am horrified that this was published with its current title, ""A Nursing Home’s 64-Day Covid Siege: ‘They’re All Going to Die’."" As if there is not enough trauma and death in our current climate, to mislead readers with such a sensationalized headline I imagine exists only to attract views feels obscene. It is heartbreaking that eleven residents died. It is unconscionable to try to bait readers with those eleven deaths in one Burlington facility instead of focusing on the fight to protect the lives of millions of Black Americans."
2020-06-08 19:01:01,For profit explains it all
2020-06-08 20:19:53,"As an Advanced Practice Nurse, the COVID crisis in nursing homes (LTC) was both predictable, and unpredictable.
Yes, I knew once I stated to pay attention in late January that once the virus was in my (nor-for-profit) facility, there would be no stopping it. 
We did everything right: isolated any suspected patients, wore PPE, monitored temps, test, test, test. And it still marched in and raged. Approx 96% of our LTC residents tested positive, two-thirds of which were ill enough to need supportive care (oxygen, tylenol, IVFs, hospitalization). At the end, 30%  died. 
Yes, some were already quite ill, but the time they had left was taken once they got COVID. The staff worked day and night to keep the residents well, or if they could not be well, at least comfortable. Every CNA and LPN is to be commended for the commitment they made and kept to our residents.
In the past, I had worked for the company mentioned in the article, and while they operate on a fine line of profit, as do all nursing homes, it is still a for profit entity. 
That's the problem: taking GOOD care of the most vulnerable of our citizens should not be determined by whether or not a profit is made. 
But if Genesis continues it's downward stock slide, and filed chapter 13, what would happen to the 500+ LTC facilities? 
Will state receivership be a better option? How would that be when COVID swings back around in the fall?"
2020-06-08 20:23:22,"I have an elderly acquaintance whose 90 year old sister lived in an assisted living facility in Maryland. As dementia set in her hairdresser, who was not an employee of the facility, conned the poor woman in to altering her will, writing out the family and writing in herself into what was a multi-million dollar inheritance. Employees of the facility were complicit and received a cut of the money. The lawyers for the corporate owner of the facility claim no responsibility and are offering such a measly settlement that it's not enough to pay my friend's lawyer.

Families need to be aware that such scams happen. In this case the crooks and opportunists got away with it."
2020-06-08 20:42:56,"While Genesis cannot be held responsible for the COVID outbreak, I can say that as a person whose parent had the unfortunate experience of having a parent in one of their facilities, I am not surprised that my local Genesis affiliate is the site of a local outbreak. They are chronically understaffed and I witnessed them  leave the elderly to sit in soiled diapers for hours on end. Calls for help went unanswered. Reidents were not bathed, nails or hair left untrimmed. I would not subject my dog to the kind of neglect that my father suffered during his four month stay at a Genesis facility. When my medically frail father left Genesis, he looked like a homeless man.  I got my dad out of there as soon as I was able to transfer him to another nursing home. It was a long drive for me to visit my dad after that, but well worth the transfer. Run, RUN away from Genesis."
2020-06-08 20:51:57,"Until we get rid of all For Profit nursing homes and long-term care facilities, we will continue to have our loved ones neglected and endangered.

Chains like Genesis referenced in this article and the chain that owned the Andover facility in New Jersey, will do as little as possible, including nursing care, quality meals, rehabilitation, and, most importantly lately, housekeeping and custodial services.

If you asked families if they would send their loved ones to the lowest bidder, most would say no.  But in reality, that is what they're doing."
2020-06-08 21:07:45,"Whose characterization of the family members is this?  Is it Kim Baker or the facility?

""On the calls, family members fell into two camps: those who thanked the home for everything, and those ... who asked questions like a prosecutor.""

Families have a right to truthful and accurate information, and a duty to advocate for their loved one."
2020-06-08 21:24:09,"When there's a mass shooting the US, the Onion runs the same article, ""there's nothing we could do, says only nation where this regularly happens."" 

I feel the same way about Nursing Homes. I've been seeing the same stories for decades about their sad and sorry state.

COVID-19 is an escalation, but see above. Will anything change?"
2020-06-08 21:25:01,My Mom's nursing home did a good job controlling things but there were deaths. My Mom is fine but confined to her room all day every day. She only gets to leave her room to go outside for a 20 minute visit once a week. Will she ever be able to walk freely around the facility again? Will I ever be able to take her anywhere outside of the facility. I doubt it.
2020-06-08 21:34:59,"Death is an ugly business to be in. I remember as a high school student volunteering at a nursing home. What a way to whither and waste away. 

I think if I ever get that old and infirm I can only hope I’ll be able to set sail one last time and succumb to a storm."
2020-06-08 22:35:45,"The architecture of healthcare in the US unfortunately circulates elderly patients through hospitals and psychiatric facilities and back to post acute care facilities (PAC) as soon as possible to keep hospital beds free for more patients.  Non-Green House facilities have infrastructure that encourages close contact.  

And the workers are paid little, often forcing them to work at more than one facility.  Additionally nurses often contract to multiple facilities.  

It would be very surprising if this network did not act as a super spreader for Covid-19.  

The driver is profit.  Hospitals have high paid CEOs who are remunerated for optimizing for profit.  

Hopefully, now a new architecture will be tried.  If there is a successful transition the highly paid administrators will have earned their rewards.  Otherwise ...."
2020-06-08 22:50:09,"The problem is we don’t value our elderly. We don’t care if they are alone and unable to care for themselves and have no place else to go.    And nursing homes if you have a hospital in the area that is paying people 5 to 15 dollars or more an hour depending on your position where do you think people are going work?  Nursing homes were not prepared for COVID 19 the country wasn’t prepared for it....a visitor could have brought it in and it could have been incubating in an asymptomatic patient for a week before the others showed signs.   It’s very easy to have 20/20 hindsight now I know families are grieving but if this had been the flu would it have garnered the same response.   But a new disease that no one had a clue was going to be this virulent took many lives and that in part was because the country was not prepared as whole.  No testing supplies, no personal protective equipment and limited knowledge.   Don’t think for a minute that healthcare staff doesn’t think about they could have, should have or tried to do.   They don’t work in nursing homes for the money, they stay there because they care."
2020-06-08 23:03:56,"I'm glad there is finally a story about this.  According to statistics 42% Of US Covid-19 deaths are from 0.62% of the population - that is the elderly in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  It's even higher in some states.  70% of total Covid-19 deaths in Ohio, 69% in Pennsylvania, and 81% in Minnesota.  Instead of worrying about people in restaurants and on beaches, maybe society should be concentrating on protecting the most vulnerable who live in institutions like these."
2020-06-08 23:44:03,"This is a national tragedy, and there are many truths in this story. A close friend is an RN at a Genesis facility here near Philadelphia - she kept me apprised as the virus tore through it as well, killing nearly 30 people there. Everyone wants to find someone to blame, but here's the truth: her facility, like this one, could not get tests. I repeat - they could not get tests. When they did, they waited 10 or more days for results. They did not have enough masks. Their supervisors tried in vain to get them - they did not exist. Nurses were forced to wear one mask - for a week. In the meantime, the CDC, having never seen this virus, was forced to change its protocols every other day. Who should be blamed? Obviously, our government. Ample warning from overseas, but not enough tests or PPE. If medical staff are unable to DO THEIR JOBS, how can they save lives? It is not possible."
2020-06-08 23:45:46,My Father lasted four mos. in a Nursing home at 98 yrs old as I had to admit him after his caretaker my brother suddenly died when he became sick at 69 yrs old of a strange respiratory illness that gave him nine brain absesses...so I could not take care of him but went to the NH daily...fed him fresh smoothies that I delivered and made in his room with a blender..this was all that I could do as he rarely ate..couldnt chew the food or swallow and there was no one to feed him one morning when i would show up just to see what was going on........this I did daily and if I could change things I would have kept a proper bed at home and visting nurses...he did not even know how to ask for anything never used the call bell...now Dad was somewhat blind..but it was so dangerous and I know people are so vulnerable especially needing diaper changes but no water and I could barely get any info about his meds...it was all an eyeopener...I paid his 2000 per mo sharing a room as well as some Medicaid kicking in..i could not care for him at home myself but in hindsite its almost impossible and well its over now...........think about it and the only way to do this is if you can visit everyday...just to watch ..
2020-06-09 00:20:02,Care facilities were a disgrace BEFORE #Coronavirus hit. There needs to be a major investigation & changes in how these places are regulated.
2020-06-09 01:23:42,"If anything, the trump administration has showed that Seniors are completely dispensable."
2020-06-09 02:41:23,"You do know Governor Cuomo signed an executive order requiring nursing homes to take covid patients, knowing full well the elderly and infirm were the most vulnerable population."
2020-06-04 10:18:48,"People with Type A appear to live longer in general, and coronavirus is more likely to cause severe illness in older people. Were these studies large enough to control for age?"
2020-06-08 14:47:13,"A 50% increase sounds bad but what is the absolute risk?  A 1/100,000 to 2/100,000 is a doubling of risk, but it is inconsequential.  Science writers really should include the raw numbers for lay people to fully understand risk."
2020-06-08 15:15:25,"This article stated that two key elements which caught my immediate attention:

1) Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.  

2) This virus ""triggers an overreaction of the immune system in some people, leading to massive inflammation and lung damage.""

I am a senior, well into the high risk age group.  I also have that blood type and suffer from severe autoimmune issues.

While I greatly appreciate this information was shared in the NYTimes, I suddenly feel more vulnerable than ever.  

I keep asking myself how/will this information help me or will it cause me more stress, resulting in more autoimmune stress issues."
2020-06-08 15:57:37,"Have they looked at any of the subgroups of blood types, as well?  Like Lewis, Kell, MNS, and several others. Some of which (Lewis, in particular)  have differing frequencies in different racial populations. I’ve been wondering if those factors aren’t as or equally important as socio-economic factors in why some racial groups are harder hit."
2020-06-08 16:23:34,"So many variables that weren't considered,or at least not mentioned in the article.  I looked at the abstract of the Chinese study and the European study and don't see other variables included there either. Age, obesity, heart disease, gender , smoking etc. And the small size of both studies make this more alarming and stressful than potentially useful."
2020-06-08 17:52:16,"I'm beginning to suspect that, in time, COVID-19 will be thought of primarily as an immuno-modulatory disease rather than a respiratory disease.

While all diseases trigger an immune response, and this coronavirus does disproportionately attack cells in the lining of the lungs, what's really sickening and killing people is their own immune response to the virus (not damage to the cells from the virus itself). Immune dysfunction is also what's behind the rare but severe disease which develops in children weeks after a mild or asymptomatic initial infection.

I'm fearful that in the coming months and years we'll see an increasing incidence of autoimmune disease in the previously infected population, similar to the way some people develop Guillain-Barre syndrome or experience the earliest signs of RA or MS after acute viral infections. I dearly hope genetics can elucidate something useful about these severe/aberrant immune responses to better direct further research and resources."
2020-06-08 18:00:41,"While there is a need for quick communication, publishing NYT level story on a Prepub seems bad precedence. While the Peer review process is not beyond fault, at least the independent vigilance. Urgency does not trump due diligence."
2020-06-08 15:02:16,"This is totally misleading.  All of the data shows that people with Type A blood are at greater risk of CATCHING Covid 19, NOT of having severe complications - except that they're at greater risk of catching the virus.

2020-06-08 15:53:14,"I’m disappointed to see the comments trying to look for alternative explanations, as if medical doctors and PhDs would forget to control for factors and not mention that, or that the Times wouldn’t bother either.

This is important information to know. No matter what your age, blood type or other risk factors, wear a mask and physical distance. It’s up to us to protect others even if we don’t have high risk factors."
2020-06-08 15:53:23,"Why did they use a control of ""2,205 blood donors with no evidence of Covid-19""?  Shouldn't the control population have been people who had been infected with Covid-19 and had recovered without having had respiratory failure?"
2020-06-08 14:05:55,"Publishing a poorly researched article about a non-peer reviewed study, all to get some hits. Hope you know what you're doing. The NYT has truly fallen so low."
2020-06-08 20:32:20,"This is a well-written and rather interesting article despite being about studies that may not have yet been peer-reviewed.  We need to keep that in our minds to avoid premature excitement about the findings.  For some readers, the enormous gush of medical articles about covid-19 in the daily press has been quite upsetting especially if interpreted without guidance of a wise medical professional to provide perspective for their personal situation."
2020-06-08 21:13:23,"According to medicine and biology there are two major blood types- Rh positive and Rh negative. The Rh refers to the presence (+) or absence(-) of a protein substance on the surface of red blood cells. The major blood groups are A,B, O and AB. So the characterization of blood  as Type A is factually in correct."
2020-06-08 21:14:44,"34% of the world population possesses Type A blood.
No need to feel alone !

And, yes, those with Type O blood do have a longer life expectancy.

Lastly,  these early studies done in Wuhan & NY hospitals are broad -- relative to what we will eventually discover about this virus."

I asked mine several years ago, and a few times since, as part of yearly visit & lab work, to please  test for and tell me my blood type. 

She said no. 
Other than Vitamin D levels, she also insists there's no way to check on various vitamin readings, which I don't think is accurate. 

Which is a long way to say -- I'd really like to know my blood type about now."

  ""Gluten sensitivity, with or without Celiac disease, drives the production of inflammatory cytokines."" According to the Grain Brain Whole Life Plan
Those with A or AB blood type are the ones who don't have the stomach acid strength to digest gluten according to Eat Right for your Blood Type.  Also, type As have a sensitive immune system.
Hence the connection to Type A Blood.  Wondering about AB though."
2020-06-09 02:05:20,The results of the study cited here showed higher risk for A-positive individuals not all As.
2020-06-09 03:44:46,"Another article in a long list of those appearing in the NYT to give partial information in a seeming attempt to frighten their readership.  Geneticists needed to 'scour' our DNA to make a match between a disease and our blood type?  Hardly.  Why was there no differentiation between A+ and A- types?  In the US, type A blood is found in roughly 42% of the population, regardless of age group or sex.  Why does the coronavirus not present in a similar way?  CDC data indicates that the average of death in the US from coronavirus is late 70s.  In Italy it was 79.  The average life expectancy in the US is 78.2

This study could be very helpful for medical professionals in protecting their patients, but the way it's presented here in the NYT, the message is if you have type A blood you're in danger.  At this point in the spread of the pandemic there's enough data to build a fairly accurate picture of the groups most at risk.  Nobody's doing anything to protect those groups, instead the focus is on scaring everyone."
2020-06-08 23:16:44,I agree with the writers who suggest that this was not peer reviewed and should not be reported until that is accomplished.  Another bug is the description of a 50% increase but without any indication of 50% of what?  What is the baseline?
2020-06-09 00:42:13,"37% of Japanese have type A blood – the largest group. Japan has a population of 127 million and fewer than 1000 deaths from the coronavirus. Washington State has a population of 7.2 million with 1,163 deaths. There's more than blood type involved."
2020-06-09 00:51:35,"I'm A+ and not worried at all.  I wear a mask when (rarely) out of the house; wash my hands a lot; socially distance....what more can anyone do no matter what their blood type?

By the way, donating blood, which is badly needed now, will give you your blood type and you'll do a good deed at the same time."
2020-06-09 01:53:07,Well this is a bummer. The only interesting thing I found out being drafted in 1968 was stamped on my dog tags; “A Neg”.

The style resonates with the moment, the spontaneity, and the call to action. Thank you for making each piece a stand-alone piece of art.  I, for one, will decorate my home with these, where my children can see. I hope teachers around the country can make use of the art, somehow, as a reminder to students young and old, when the new school year starts, to guide them to a path of hope and change that they can take. Suggestion for teachers, especially elementary level: print out the art to use as decorated notecards, to give/send to your students with words of praise, encouragement, empowerment.

2020-06-09 17:37:29,"Now Amazon is stepping up by improving sanitation but also by testing, which is extremely important.  At the same time that many were decrying that Amazon was abusing its employees, people were ordering record amounts from them so they wouldn't have to expose themselves in a store. It is the same blindness that people want to see the meat counter fully stocked as if the meat just flies there by magic. If you are ordering online, some other human is taking the risk you are unwilling to take. Is that fair?"

On the other hand, I feel that this is no longer enough given Amazon's culture. I would applaud amazon if they allowed their employees to unionize, it's the best way for employees to advocate for their rights."
2020-06-09 18:26:41,"Companies should look into group testing (or batch testing) where 5 or 10 swaps are placed together in one test tube and are tested using a single test.

The Covid test is not like a cholesterol test where you need the exact number. It is a binary test (a yes or a no). So, when most people are expected to be negative, it makes sense to group them together. 

According to recent NYTimes articles, this is how the Chinese were able to test millions of people in Wuhan and all  within 10 days."
2020-06-09 18:31:01,I like many people are torn between the big retailers such as Amazon and Walmart and the local retailer. I think Amazon is putting on a show in an attempt to say to prospective employees we care. Personally don't believe any of it. The same goes for Walmart. Both retailers have proven time and again that it is profits over employee safety.
2020-06-09 18:43:53,"Very glad to see NYT trying to cover this fairly and factually. Standard workplace procedures, masks and PEP really do work.

People who have jobs in workplaces that follow best practices, even hospital covid units, are more likely to catch the virus in the community and bring it to work than they are to catch it at work.

Any large workplace employing thousands of people -- Amazon warehouse, Tesla manufacturing, Boeing, chicken processing -- is going to see covid cases. It doesn't mean they got it at work."
2020-06-09 17:56:04,"Huzzah. The Amazon propaganda machine is looking ship shape.

2020-06-09 18:53:10,"And we are supposed to believe that this was an unannounced visit - with a documentary photographer - to a randomly chosen Amazon warehouse. And that Amazon had no prior knowledge of this unannounced visit.

Right? Right?"
2020-06-09 20:41:07,This is the same warehouse or in the same vicinity of coporate HQ. This does not represent how all warehouses are equipped now. It is the same PR stunt as 60 Minutes.

2020-06-10 02:59:00,I have toured several Amazon fulfillment centers and came away very impressed in numerous respects.  These jobs aren’t easy. They require energy and focus.  The pay and benefits are good compared to other entry level jobs.  There is nothing mysterious about these Amazon jobs.  I understand why service unions want to unionize Amazon workers.  I also recognize that service unions benefit members but also non-members since some employers may be motivated to persuade their employees not to join a union because of what that entails.  What I reject are dishonest arguments (e.g. AOC’s slave wages blarney) because the facts don’t fit.  “Whistleblowers“ who are just undercover union operatives should be categorized accurately.  Credit Amazon for what it actually does and does well.  Push its competitors to step up.
2020-06-10 06:27:17,"Unfortunately, many workers at Amazon do not obey safety measures required, including managers and those assigned to monitor them. Many do not wear their mask appropriately or at all since it makes them hot while working or it's hard to breathe or talk clearly when necessary. Many do not keep safe distance. These are the same individuals that do not behave in a safe manner in public. So, even though Amazon has implemented safety measures, many individuals do not follow instructions as in any workplace or in public because they don't like to be told what to do."
2020-06-09 20:17:20,"So finally NYT writes something positive about Amazon. In last 1  year of being a subscriber, I have never read a single positive article in NYT about Amazon."
2020-06-09 20:09:56,"Let's see now.

People from the media were allowed inside an Amazon warehouse because Amazon ""invited"" them there.

I assume that Amazon would not have ""invited"" them there if it thought they would find anything lacking in its trvamped ""workplace.""  And in fact they didn't.

Amazon apparently allowed them to speak to exactly one employee (I say ""exactly one"" because there is no other indication in the article text of more than one), and that one employee was permitted to get anywhere near the news media because Amazon had ""authorized"" her to do so.

Meanwhile, Amazon has also become known for squeezing every ounce of labor it can get from its line-level employees, and the article the article, focusing in a tunnel-vision-like way on what Amazon is doing about coronavirus concerns has nothing to say about this.

You're going to have to forgive me, New York Times, but I think you've been used.  There's almost nothing in this article that couldn't have been cobbled together from a packet of Amazon-created press releases and an Amazon-created gallery of photographs.

There is, or should be, a difference between reporting and stenography, between subsurface investigation and parroting corporate public relations.

And Jeff Bezos says that this is ""the hardest time we've ever faced.""

I just . . . I just can't . . . Oh, that is so touching.  I'm overcome, and I need to sign off now, so that I can weep privately over the hard times of the richest man on the planet."

An unexplored strategy would aim to keep the mouth as clean as possible.  Thus any viral particles are cleaned out and disposed of regularly.  Using an approved mouth wash (not bleach) would be a start.

One mystery, involving loss of taste, probably means that virus on the tongue is getting into the taste buds and infecting them.  The cleaning strategy might be effective to avoid this.

For those working in healthcare mouth washing every 2 hours or so and rinsing the eyes every 4 hours might be protective.

BTW, in the Amazon warehouse wearing a mask has a side benefit because with all the cardboard being handled, there must be large amounts of wood fibers floating around."
2020-06-10 14:47:51,Too bad they haven’t enforced those same safety measures with the Prime Shoppers at Whole Foods. I am a team member at a Whole Foods and am very concerned watching the Amazon group gathering in the same break rooms we use. The signs on the walls  limit 3 people in the break room and yet they are sitting shoulder to shoulder on the couches with masks pulled down to their necks. There are Amazon supervisors on site but they aren’t enforcing the rules. I eat in my car to avoid the constant over crowding. The number of shoppers is increasing everyday due to the increase in demand. I’m over 60 and scared.

The response to the problem of workers leaving the floor to get pain meds from their locker was to put pain med vending machines on the floor to save time. All endured for a less-than-living wage. 

The mask and latex gloves I wore to enter a grocery store yesterday became sweaty in a half-hour bi-monthly shop. Must be excruciating for a whole shift of physical labor.

Deaths have been falling throughout this period which means that while we are finding more cases, the cases we are finding are milder on average than the ones we found before (probably because the standards for who gets a test are becoming looser).

And while I share concerns that the protests in recent weeks may lead to more cases, we are now well into the period when such cases SHOULD have started showing up in the numbers in DC, NYC, Boston, SF, LA and other areas and yet they have not, so I am becoming mildly optimistic that, once again, the epidemiologists have cried wolf (see: Memorial Day).

One week we're in a crisis with Iran; then it's North Korea; then China; then Mexico and the Wall; etc., etc. Trump's plans to address the West Point graduation ceremony and to re-start his campaign rallies are calculated to send the message that coronavirus is over, reinforced by the messaging from Mnuchin dining inside at a restaurant, the Chief of Staff ridiculing reporters for mask-wearing, and the revised plans for a full-on Republican convention spectacle. And by the way, be ready for the results of ""Operation Warp Speed,"" which will be that a vaccine will be available this year, probably just before election time. But note that its use will be on an ""emergency basis,"" meaning that there will not be firm data on its efficacy, but we'll find out by giving it to millions and hoping it works and that it's actually safe for widespread use."

To quote Sun Tzu on the Art of War - “The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.”  Trump as “the buck doesn’t stop here” President, is not a General and not even a Private, just a self-described “wartime” and now “law and order” president who dodged the draft five times.

It's unbelievably selfish and inconsiderate not to wear a mask in public.   But of course when the supposed leader of the country won't wear a mask, what can you expect.

I think it's a bit less than candid to claim that ""the nation’s capital appears to be done with the coronavirus.""  At the House Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, all attendees were positioned at a distance and many were wearing masks.

Here in Italy, the reopening continues on the premise that the virus has not left us, but we must learn to live with it.  From talking to friends and family in the States and seeing a lot of film footage, many Americans seem to be adopting a similar attitude."

They are probably waiting for Dr. Trump to announce the date on which this miraculous ""going away"" will take place. The economy will bounce back to life on the exact same day!

It is quite likely that 2 whole virus based vaccines may be administered to volunteers by September. 

Some Chinese companies have taken the more conventional route and used whole inactivated virus instead of more exotic but unproven techniques. Sometimes, the simplest solutions prove to be the most effective. Vaccine makers who have chosen other routes have extraneous materials in their products which introduces an element of the unknown. It may turn out that inactivated whole virus vaccines will also stimulate the best antibody responses.  They may also be inherently safer. 

It will be interesting to see if a simple but scientifically and historically valid technique will lead to an effective vaccine as more ""high tech"" vaccines find glitches with their unproven technologies."

By Election Day it is likely that in excess of 200,000 citizens will have died.  Virtually everybody will know someone who has died or suffered mightily because of this disease.

Three months later, largely the result of premature openings, we are again in the same state of uncertainty.  Therefore, we bore the pain of the shutdowns but as a nation will not receive the appropriate benefit.  The absence of a competent national leadership is costing the nation and its citizens far more than what was necessary.

This not only on the part of the nation's leaders but also the general population which has demonstrated poor judgement in understanding the meaning of freedom, self-sacrifice, and true grit.

The side effects of the lockdowns across America may already be deadlier than the pandemic itself, as a number of researchers have concluded.

Are we expected to live in Trump's delusional fantasy world where he can deny reality - an ongoing deadly pandemic killing tens of thousands - because he doesn't like it & doesn't want to be bothered with it?  And no one is going to hold him accountable?

It's easy to see how Trump built those Atlantic City casinos, stiffed his contractors and when they went bankrupt, he pulled his money out leaving his shareholders to take the hit. 

Over a decade, he suffered business losses totaling one billion dollars - reportedly the largest in our history.  He then found a career pretending to be a successful mogul on ""The Apprentice.""

Trump pretended to be his own P.R. guy ""John Baron"" calling Liz Smith at the Daily News to tell her Madonna was calling Trump's office because she wanted to date him.

2020-06-11 21:32:49,"I'm not sure what the NYTimes wants DC to do at this point regarding the pandemic.  Looking at the 'spikes' seen in some states, I'd say that this virus will continue to infect people.  We shuttered the country, and with it, the economy and livelihoods (and sanity) of millions of people and their families.  Over 100,000 people have died.  But, does anyone believe that DC can fix this or stop the virus in it's tracks?  

It was right to stop flights from China and Europe.  It was right to adopt stay in place for the weeks that we did to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system.  It was right to create stimulus to help citizens and small businesses.  And it was right to leave policies going forward up to the states as the infection rates vary wildly across states and within states.  Use of modeling was good early on to try to understand the spread and potential needs of our healthcare system, but it was wrong as most models are given minimal data and assumptions required with a new virus with little information.

But, it is wrong to close the country down.  States need to handle hotspots with stay in place, contact tracing (where possible, given the reluctance of many to be tracked), and to continue testing.  But even testing data will be flawed as there will be false positives based on an areas infection rate (if low, false positives increase).  And, some tests are bad as people take the opportunity to create tests for a buck."
2020-06-08 15:32:37,"Beyond the virus testing issue and the individuals involved, it’s important to bring out the larger lessons learned that could be applied, going forward, to other challenging societal problems as part of the “No returning to normal” zeitgeist.
I see seven in this one article.
Call it corporate philanthropy, or whatever, it has a place in the mix of a re-envisioned capitalism. You can use your existing skills, while building new ones, but it doesn’t necessarily matter whether it is or isn’t part of “the core business”--if it’s helping. Philanthropy sometimes gets demeaned or seen as less important as there’s not necessarily “a business model.” 
Ponder the possibilities of “no one said no when…asked for help.” And those asked came from several fields. 
If the first few rounds of a new idea don’t work or are limited, which can often be the case, it is possible to learn from that and come up with an offering that appears to overcome them.
They included an element of globalization that could still work.
While the innovation is considered “technical” here, it also has elements of social innovation.
There’s room in the Times’ various “How do I keep from getting bored” features to include suggestions for those who want to try to create something society badly needs.
You really need a culture that allows going through the bad ideas to get to the good ones. So the “iced coffee that smelled like hot” served its purpose.
You had a journalist and editor who knew to pick up on this story."

2020-06-10 11:39:31,"In order to achieve ‘herd immunity’ approximately 75% of the population must have been infected.  For the United States, that works out to roughly 240 million people.  Assuming, and while there is some data that points to this conclusion, that for every 50 people infected, only 1 person has a clinical illness requiring hospital admission.  That works out to 4.8 million people.  With a current mortality rate of roughly 5%, that is 240,000 deaths that can be expected until there is herd immunity.
And that is assuming that only one out of every 50 infected people develops a clinical infection requiring hospitalization.  If it is one out of every 25, then we are talking 480,000 deaths due to COVid.  If it is one out of every 10, we are talking about 1,200,000   COVid related deaths.  That assumes that we continue to have the resources available to treat 24,000,000 infected people.
Scaling that up to the current world population of around 8 billion people, One could estimate that there would be anywhere from 80,000,000 to 400,000,000 deaths worldwide...and that assumes that everyone gets the best possible healthcare"
2020-06-10 11:54:24,"It is time to examine the administration’s approach to vaccine development. The administration recently decided to focus its efforts in five leading candidates. This sounds kind of reasonable me but why only 5? In a race that is so critical it makes sense to invest in more, maybe twenty different t approaches with the hope that one or more will prove effective. Focusing on five front runners means that other approaches, including approaches that are substantively different will be abandoned early on and this is probably a fateful mistake!!"
2020-06-10 12:09:51,"So the race is on.  This vaccine, probably whether it works or not, is worth over one billion dollars and huge bragging rights.   The average Pharma vaccine, which often does not work, brings in $1,000,000,000 on average — worth it if it works and has acceptable side effects but we can't know that on an individual basis.

The problem is that the range of efficacy and the prevalence and degree of negative effect is highly variable person to person because of biochemical individuality.  

This fast-tracked vaccine will skip animal testing and will be the first genetically engineered messenger RNA and nanoparticle vaccine.  That means it's far more risky than any flu vaccine.  People simplistically think that every vaccine is just another vaccine.  They aren't.  

If you're concerned that Pharma might get sued that's been taken care of so you needn't worry.  Pharma lobbyists have captured Congress and they’ve passed a law giving legal immunity to vaccine makers because what's good for Pharma is good for the country.  

That means you don't want to be first in line for your injection. 

But you may not have that choice because Alan Dershowitz  (who once advised police officers to not be too nice to suspects) has argued that the Supreme Court in 1905 (Jacobson v. Massachusetts), gives state governments the right to come in and forcibly inject you with a vaccine.  The current Supreme Court will likely go along with that."
2020-06-10 12:26:11,"Science deniers are busy pointing out where mistakes have been made or projections have proven incorrect.
They are missing the mark. We need to base our thinking on a more reasonable question: Where would we be in the absence of scientific/epidemiologic learnings?
First we would not have shutdown and isolated. Estimates are that this action has so far saved 600 million lives worldwide and eliminated infecting and sickening billions. This level of contagion would have created an economic cataclysm that would dwarf the one we face now.
Second we have learned the value of masks, social distancing, hand washing etc. The steps will make our homes and workplaces cleaner and safer. The benefits for this will accrue and multiply over time reducing future impacts of flu and other contagious entities.
Lastly we have reinforced the value of vaccines. Hopefully deniers will get the obvious message and safeguard their children and the rest of us by using those vaccines already available to us such as measles, TB and Polio.
Yes scientists have made some mistakes here but so have public policy makers and the general population. 
Let us regard all of it as life experience gathering and move on positively. Learn from our mistakes but do not become absorbed in useless recrimination or worse throw our hands up and surrender as Ross Douthat would suggest."
2020-06-10 12:42:43,"I am encouraged but also cautiously optimistic that an effective and safe vaccine can be produced, much less by next year.

I keep thinking that it's been over 30 years since the AIDS virus became globally known and feared.  And yet, there is still no vaccine for that.

In the meantime, thank you worldwide scientists for your hard work, diligent and painstaking hours and energy you are putting forth to help human kind.  I am greatly and deeply appreciative. Good luck to you all."
2020-06-10 12:51:50,"Any vaccine development needs the testing time to ensure safety and an absence of serious side effect as well as efficacy. 

Rushing testing might miss the side effects. About 21 years ago, a vaccine for rotovirus was found to later cause intestinal blockage and was withdrawn.  It was too late for infants who were affected.

I have no doubt a safe vaccine will be available at some point and I’ll be glad to get in line for a dose, but I don’t want to end up being a test subject because bringing it to market was rushed."

I live in Seattle, lean Democratic, and took self isolation seriously other then cycling for my health outdoors.  It is now clear that the self isolation worked and it is time to move on unless you are over 75-80 years of age or are compromised.  The WHO reverses itself daily and when we all realize this is another deadly flu strain and how many other countries have been able to suppress it, it is time to move on.

2020-06-10 13:51:45,"Two points: 

(1) A reliable vaccine isn’t likely to be available for widespread commercial use until well after the presidential election. So why isn’t the federal government making a responsible effort to trace and track; identify carriers and then quarantine them? Is the president willing to risk another spiking outbreak for his (and Republicans’) political advantage? Do they think that a sicker America is the silver sliver on the dark horizon as our death toll continues to climb? Do they think that more ruined healthy people and their deaths will equal more votes for them in a free-falling economy? As they try to destroy the Affordable Care Act?

(2) If reliable economic forecasts indicate that the interest rate for federal government borrowing will be “rock bottom for several years,” then why aren’t we hearing about an infrastructure project to create jobs and re-seed national and local economies? Mitch McConnell and his Republican dogs-in-the-manger are refusing to aid battered states and municipalities because they don’t want to borrow on the nation’s future. Hello, Republicans: you did that with two wars on a credit card and a $1.7-trillion tax cut for the one percent. The money is there; you just don't want to spend it to benefit small businesses and Main Street. It’s legal protections for Wall Street—or nothing.

How is this good government? Or is that the point: no government at all. Oh, I forgot; “...government is the problem.”—Ronald Reagan, January 20, 1981."

2020-06-10 15:38:04,"On May 12th, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield met with a Senate committee and ""predicted dire consequences if the nation reopened its economy too soon, noting that the United States still lacked critical testing capacity and the ability to trace the contacts of those infected"" just a day after Trump declared that “we have met the moment and we have prevailed.”

Now, almost a one month later, ""the number of cases is increasing in 21 states, as Americans try to return to their normal routines.""

None of this information factors in the untold number of jam packed protests which occurred in the past two weeks in this country as well as throughout the world.

I wonder who Trump will blame and name this potential resurgence on this time . . ."
2020-06-10 16:27:50,"""More cases"" needs to be examined more closely.  This virus continues to spread.  It is believed that it has become less potent -- although the mass protests may have changed that trajectory.  
As more people are tested, it's natural to see more cases.  The issue is the seriousness of those cases."
2020-06-10 15:57:35,"Here is further evidence—if any were needed—for Paul Krugman’s assertion elsewhere in today’s paper that “America has failed the marshmallow test”. By which he means that our impatience, inability to delay gratification, infantilization, leaves us with the knowledge and resources to combat the virus, but woefully lacking the will to do so. Trump’s own immature, undisciplined, uncontrolled approach to everything may be a symptom more than a cause, but it serves as a useful metaphor for our collective inability to focus and concentrate for an extended period of time on what is, in this case, a life-and-death challenge. Like the spoiled child that Trump proves himself to be every day, the majority of Americans simply lack the “right stuff” that enabled “the greatest generation” to defeat everything from the depression to fascism. As a result, we will be judged by the Trumpian company we keep in part because so many of us have adopted so many of its unseemly adolescent and juvenile traits."
2020-06-10 16:19:51,"Yes, the economy needs to re-open.  Yes, people need to have money to pay their bills.  But the way this country is set up we're going to be forcing people to choose between their safety, their family's safety, and working in places that are not safe because, in more than a few cases, the employer doesn't want to spend the money to make the workplace safer.  

Some of what needs to be fixed are office layouts, the ventilation systems, sick time, the availability of high quality day care for all parents who need it, high quality day care for adults who need it, a real health CARE system instead of our fragmented, dysfunctional wealth care system, and jobs that pay more than the bare minimum.  (Even $15/hour is barely scraping by in many places.)

If all we're going to do is reopen the economy, force people back to work before they feel it's safe, penalize people for whatever we can so they cannot collect unemployment, and never fix the social safety net, we might as well count on another long siege with this or another illness.  

America can do better.  We did more for women and children during WWII when we needed women to work.  Why can't we do it now and do it for all Americans?"

What other measures could the governor go by? I suppose one question might be,  did the  seafood workers and ferry crew members come from other states with high infection rates? And then, even if cases have risen, there was only a single death in an entire month. Much as I believe that every life is precious, that doesn't seem reasonable to stay locked down for.
I don't understand how states' economies are supposed to move forward unless businesses are allowed to reopen and people take responsibility for their health. Again, the curve was flattened to the point of not overcrowding hospitals, now we have to move forward, with safety precautions foremost."
2020-06-10 16:34:48,The goal of locking down was to flatten the curve.  We need to keep monitoring and managing.  That's the most we can do. We're not going to end the pandemic until a vaccine is available.
2020-06-10 16:36:05,"Of course. Increased testing means increased cases. What we need to know is what the percentage of cases are per 100 tests. And then we need to know the percentage of hospitalizations of more than a few days where people are dying. My guess, is that the percentage of cases per hundred tests is lower, as is the percentage of people dying, now that we know about proning as a far better alternative to ventilation. Now is the time to compare the rate of death by covid-19 ibfextioon to the rate of death by a bad flu season infection, beginning with cases of Covid incurred at the beginning of May."
2020-06-10 16:38:10,"We could use autohemotherapy, which works like a weekly vaccine, to fully activate our immune system while we wait for the vaccine, even if the pharmaceutical industry protests. Our own blood (5 ml) injected into the shoulder or buttock works like a foreign body to be rejected by the nuclear phagocytic system. Activation lasts for a week and the defense grows from 5% normal to 22% and returns to its normal state when macrophages finish clearing blood from muscle. So autohemotherapy is injected weekly. The pharmaceutical industry disdains this therapy for being practically free and for threatening the profits of the sector. Having a strong immune system is the best option in these times when we don't have a vaccine."

2020-06-10 16:31:54,"The NYT seems bent on stoking fear with each Coronavirus headline. Case numbers may well be rising some areas, but what does that mean? Is there a concurrent rise in deaths? As far as I can see - and to find this out takes a good bit of searching through articles - there is no detectable rise in deaths. So I ask myself, ""What am I missing here?"" It appears that as the virus has spread, a more realistic picture of the severity among the wider population becomes clearer. And that picture, at this point anyway, would seem to indicate that it is time to start reopening on a broader scale, a much broader scale. The news media, including the NYT, have a responsibility to articulate news in a balanced and forthright manner."
2020-06-10 16:34:57,"Hi 
1. Could you set up and report a chart of hospitalization? Why?
Because hospitalizations are an excellent concurrent indicator. 

2. Also, deaths by all causes as a % of the normal rate can be reported as a lagging indicator.  

3. Finally, case rate positivity (daily new cases divided by daily tests) are a good leading indicator.

All of these indicators have the advantage of not being easily “gamed” or made to look good or bad for political reasons.

Indications are that the overwhelming majority will suffer various, mostly mild forms of discomfort similar to that of a nasty cold or flu.

That may indicate that the virus has exhausted itself in this area at this time. Or that masks may be more effective than thought before. We will know more in another 10 days (after the weekend protests). Very interesting for those of us who can follow the protests as markers of virus spread and not as political events."

The difference between WW II and COVID is that we don't have to accept a high number of deaths. The fact that deaths are increasing is directly the result of gross mismanagement on the part of the administration. Trump doesn't care how many people die as long as he gets reelected and if the dead include Biden supporters (such as the protesters), that's even better for his reelection.

I can understand the pressure to reopen businesses, but I foresee the above consequences.

Necessary: People must wear cloth masks over their noses and mouths outside of their homes, wash hands a lot, and keep 6 feet away from strangers. This will curb the disease. But many people do not want to. So there we are.

We only control the boil rate.  NYC COVID rate caused ""boil over"", shelter in place took us below ""simmer"".

And that NM has allowed too many out-of-state visitors starting Memorial weekend, the impact is still TBD. 
What the pro-reopen people seem not to understand is that the economic impact could be worse in the near future than what we've recently experienced. They fail to study the science and history of pandemics.  Philadelphia during the Spanish Flu Pandemic should be a lesson learned for handling this pandemic.

It is also likely that history will not treat Trump's presidency kindly. He, in fact, will likely go down as one of the worst presidents, if not the absolute worst, in our nation's history.

The research, led by scientists at the Britain’s Cambridge and Greenwich Universities, suggests lockdowns alone will not stop the resurgence of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, but that even homemade masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public.

“Our analyses support the immediate and universal adoption of face masks by the public,” said Richard Stutt, who co-led the study at Cambridge.


He said combining widespread mask use with social distancing and some lockdown measures, could be “an acceptable way of managing the pandemic and re-opening economic activity” before the development of an effective vaccine against COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.

Others have opted for the pleasure of the moment, and in many cases have taken risks out of financial desperation. 

The first wave has been defeated and the effects of the second wave remain to be seen. Given the information from around the world, those that ignore the threat are in great peril second time around."
2020-06-10 22:01:32,"The press is trying to figure out how to continue to scare people with bold headlines and incomplete information. I’m a healthy 61 year old who had covid over 2 months ago and I have fully recovered. It was no fun. The pandemic is evolving, not worsening. I’m convinced that in the U.S. as a whole the worst is over. There are hot spots, but they are manageable if we have leaders who understand and get good advice. A rise in cases while opening states is not a sign of worsening, but of better identification of hot spots and much more testing. Hospitalizations and deaths would suggest a worsening area , but physicians have learned how to manage the disease much better since February. The thousands of positive cases in meat packing plants did not lead to substantial death rates. While Arizona may have a hospital bed crisis, it represents a minority of the country. Tens of thousands of low risk, young people, mostly wearing masks, have been marching outdoors for over 2 weeks. A protest related spike would likely already be apparent and is unlikely to occur.  New York is opening up, Cuomo rode the subway, NJ had zero new cases today! Good news rarely makes headlines. We must remain vigilant and not fall in a state of Fauci-led despair. This helps no one."
2020-06-10 22:07:09,"The graph shown with the number of cases is good at implying the relative number of deaths across the country, but given the varying population density across the country it does not provide a good indication on how each state is fairing. May I respectfully recommend presenting normalized data, say number of cases per 100,000 people, to better show the relative impact be state/area?"
2020-06-10 22:39:17,"While the total number of cases in a given state or region is valuable information, it only measures part of the equation.

As was experienced in NY during its worst days, the key concern is the number of available hospital beds, ICU units and ventilators to treat rising levels of Covid victims.

A more useful analysis here would be to show what percentage of hospital beds etc. remains available in each State to meet new case demands.

While the demand in NY never reached the apocalyptic levels originally forecasted -- the system, particularly in New York City -- was stressed to the breaking point.  This is why NY, among several  other data points, now requires each of its regions to have a 30+% surplus of available beds before Phase I level reopening can commence.

Covid-19 remains a very real threat with neither a cure nor vaccine available.  The best we can hope for is to be able to cope and manage the contagion.  We cannot stop it.

Coping and managing this contagion means having sufficient healthcare personnel, facilities and materials on hand (including a surplus level of each) to deal with both expected and unexpected increases in caseloads.

Having faced the worst, New York now has an extensive and sophisticated data driven methodology for measuring outbreaks and managing reopenings that other states may want to duplicate.

It simply requires a commitment to managing Covid-19 on  a scientific approach rather than a political one."

Gee, how could we solve that? Surely not by doing things like increasing domestic production of high quality masks for health care workers, employees who must return to work, commuters. 

Surely not by working to develop and licensing rapid test kits or  machines that could be a game changer in opening crowded venues like schools. And scaling production to meet demand. 

Surely not in investing in other domestic manufacturing of essential goods like health supplies, hand sanitizer, vaccines, medications. Or communications and computing materials.

Surely not by finally financing infrastructure investment. Repairing roads, dams, bridges. Building safer schools. 

No, none of that will get done. We don't want to be socialist like Venezuela, or so our Fearless Leader claims. And while they are at it, they will cut Medicaid, undermine the ACA and kill foodstamps funding."

I am sparing you, and you are sparing me and that's what a society is: living together and thinking of the greater good and not what we personally want every minute.  In this respect the U.S. can be so backward and infantile; in Asia face masks are normal--and they will have to be if people want their kids to ever go back to school.  As a high school teacher I can tell you that  we HATE being separated from our students--truly--this is not why we went into teaching...and nothing is worse for a teacher than sitting alone at the dining room table all day when we are used to being together, conversing, learning, sharing, joking around.  It has been tough.  But we are also very afraid to go back.  Many of us are in our 50's or 60's or live with someone who is.  Many of us have elderly parents we care for as well.

These are indeed historical times.  Never before has the liberal propaganda machine been more effective in ""mobilizing"" people to act against their own interests and safety.

Prepare for comments like ""The disease was contained, numbers were going down, and restrictions were beginning to be loosened all over the country, and then the irresponsible leftist protesters hit the streets in huge crowds and caused a resurgence of the disease.  But the left wants to curtail the freedoms of every day Americans while they ignore those rules for themselves.""

After the lockdown, people were literally, “virus, what virus?” Mothers taking their children to the grocery store maskless and carefree.  A maskless overweight man literally whistling down the isle as he gleefully picked goods off the shelf.

What they are going to come to realize is that SARS-CoV-2 is not the flu.  You may recover but you might need a trip to the hospital to do it.  

I’m stupefied why we aren’t having a national conversation about contact tracing teams that test and treat.  Such a system, if it is coupled with mass masking, accomplishes two things simultaneously.  It reduces the number of infections and deaths and it allows you to keep your economy relatively open.

Exactly. In the winter of 68/69 and the following winter of 69/70 (my junior/senior years in high school) the Hong Kong Flu Pandemic killed over 1 million people worldwide.

The world economy did not crater and no one lost their job because there was a pandemic killing hundreds of thousands of people all over the world.

There will always be sickness and death. There will always be the occasional flu/virus pandemic. Every 10 to 20 years these things happen. We can’t respond by locking down the planet and putting milions and millions of people out of work and throwing the economy of every single country (except Sweden) into a tailspin.

He's never grasped the concept that public office means public service.  Now his famously short attention span has turned to other things, and many more will die."

Without normal activities hate festers. Pandemic is being used to spread social unrest and politics that never would be voted on. In fact, I am not aware of any call for a public vote on the actual policy of pandemic. Should this now go to the American people? A call on this in crisis is one thing, but continued action deserves the voice of the people at the ballot. Our represented government has made this about Trump or not Trump. The democratic candidate is hiding in a basement with strong signs of an aging brain. If we are to be part of a long siege this has to go directly to the voter."

That is absolutely as it should be. Just stop pointing fingers when government officials are doing the same. 

Yes, Covid-19 is a continuing and horrible threat to the world. But the containment of that virus rests not just on the federal government, but state leadership, city officials and individuals. The state in which I reside was an early   opener. And, yes, the numbers are rising again (probably to a larger degree than is being reported, since the governor is one of Trump’s barnacles). But my fellow citizens act as though nothing much has happened. Very few people wear masks and social distancing is some odd phrase they don’t seem to understand. 

Focusing on several large crises at once requires the assistance of many learned experts — we know those people are missing from or ignored by the Executive branch of our government. Since Trump has managed to end the daily Covid-19 updates — I think they weren’t as satisfying as the rallies to which he plans to return next week — the average citizen needs the media to widen its attention span."

As far as this administration actually aiming high for implementing public safety you would have to get the blessing of the Fraud Noose network for validation. - Pun intended.

We are going to see the impact of a lack of intelligent thinking on this topic.  

It wouldn't require much more effort and perhaps a lot less money to have done what I've suggested from the beginning with the Federal government taking a leadership role in the application of the appropriate supply chain logistics, competitive single payer acquisition of PPE, ventalators and other vital supplies such as test reagents, swabs, and so forth to have nipped this issue in the bud.

Instead, in my opinion, it was all about Trump, about spin, greed and overall stupidity.  

Stupid is as stupid does in the words I believe of Forrest Gump.

But the simply fact, is that the states are responsible for dealing with the virus. When Trump tried to seize more control over the virus fight, the governors of many states rose against him.

Trump is awful, but the biggest chunk of all the deaths in the nation, was due to the corrupt nursing home industry, in the Democratic City of New York, in the Democratic State of New York.

The fact is, America has made a rational decision to get on with life, that the virus risk is acceptable and the economic cost of preventing spread is too high.  Nothing immature or political about it--life has to go on, we can't hobble the economy for the length of time it would take to beat the virus, we probably can't actually win the fight against it with any certainty anyway, and hope for a vaccine in the near term is at least highly optimistic and there probably won't be one any time soon so, get on with life--and, oh yes, we understand that some of us will die as a result of this decision."

2020-06-11 00:35:37,"One of the talking points the conservatives have pushed is that there is so much conflicting information out there, they just don't know what to believe.  Trump's M.O. from the beginning--including the press and other factual information--has been to sow confusion.  I am no expert, but this virus has been with us for less than a half a year.  Of course we don't know everything about it and some mistakes have been made, but the evidence shows that those things that we have done right, like quarantining, social distancing, wearing masks--have worked.  More of us are alive than there would have been had we not done these minimal steps.  The administration (it's hard to call it that with a straight face) was successful in promoting the idea that we don't want the cure to be worse than the disease, so we'll open up and let people get their nails done and their new tattoos and have beers with their buddies. They have also been successful in politicizing the wearing of a mask. (the ignorance is mind-blowing).  So, people who must work--and now we know with no doubt that that segment of the population is mostly people of color--will be risking their lives so that science deniers can remain cavalier about how little risk they have to take because they don't want to stay home for a couple of more months."
2020-06-11 00:56:17,"The 9.3% unemployment rate at end of 2020 -- I wonder if that's with the 3%-low categorization error of April and May corrected.  (My guess: no.)

At least the BLS was honest to point out the miscategorization.  Not so the Census Bureau with it's health insured stats.

Current Census stats show 91% in the U.S. now insured.  However, that's fake.

That's because about 18% with ""health insurance"" actually have some form of Medicaid.  Either ACA expanded Medicaid, or a pre-ACA Medicaid.

In many states, all Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are not really insurance, even though misrepresented as insurance in the statistics.

They are subject to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily for a person, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.  It's a loan until death for medical expenses, not insurance, and people with this financial bomb often are unaware, due to inconspicuous notice by the relevant agencies.

The problem exists in 10 or so states, like MA, NJ, and MD.

(Some states fixed the problem, partly or completely, starting in main ACA provision year 2014, by amending their estate recovery policies.  E.g.: NY and CA.  Making at least all ACA coverage real insurance.)

But many states did not fix it.

Thus, my own state of MA claims 97% of people have health insurance.  But about 4% have Medicaid as their ""insurance"" and are also 55 or older.  So the true insured rate is about 93%.

Ditto the 91% U.S. number is a few % falsely high."

Polls [for what they are worth] show former VP Joseph R. Biden Jr. establishing a significant national lead over Mr. Trump and his approval ratings plummeting.

Trump no longer mentions COVID-19; for him, it's out of sight, out of mind.  But it's NOT OVER.  People are sick; people are dying and if you think Trump cares, think again.

I can't help but think how different this pandemic might have been if we'd had a responsible leader in the White House who could have swiftly taken action to investigate not just Floyd's death but Breonna Taylor's and others around the U.S. Yes, it's systemic and needs a larger look at how we police and what we fund. I wish we'd had a leader to communicate disgust with the Minneapolis police actions so clearly that it would not have come to this. Perhaps we might have had more creative and even more effective, 21st-century ways to protest while keeping more people safe, especially as African-Americans are disproportionately represented among covid cases and deaths already. I hope we'll see more of that creativity as the summer goes on and the closer we get to election day. Protecting the living has to be connected to honoring and defending the dead."

2020-06-11 02:04:55,"I shudder to say that because most dying are Blacks, Hispanics and poorer Whites, no one really cares as they don’t make an impact on decision makers minds"
2020-06-11 02:10:12,"We've got to get this horrible cult of grifters posing as an administration OUT.  We need a real President and a real Administration to deal with this disaster.  November can't come soon enough.  We outnumber them more than two to one.  We just have register to vote, and VOTE!

They can't steal a landslide!"
2020-06-11 01:59:56,"There were huge BLM protests in Australia over the last weekend and the first of who knows how many has tested positive to covid-19 and though wearing a mask he was infectious.
There's your risk, right there.
Trump holds his rallies with thousands of his supporters not wearing masks and yelling and screaming then  how bad could it get?

Pretty bad you'd imagine.

Watch this space..."
2020-06-11 02:06:09,"I'm confused... wasn't it a group of esteemed health care workers that said protest is more important than the virus?
Make up your mind."
2020-06-11 02:23:41,"From previous experience with SARS Viruses, both Hong Kong and Singapore did basically three things immediately: 1) Everyone wore masks 2) Practiced Social Distancing 3)Avoid Large Events. Results for the same time period:

Hong Kong 7.4 Million Population/COVID Deaths 4

Singapore   5.4 Million Population/COVID Deaths 25

New York City 8.4 Million Population/COVID Deaths 17,127

Delay is very deadly."
2020-06-11 02:30:02,"At this point, the most effective methods of stopping the spread are social distancing and wearing masks. Except in certain workplaces, these do not seem to me to be particularly onerous practices. When the sun is bright, you put on sunglasses. When a deadly virus is about, you put on a mask. Duh. It should be simple. 

We have no real choice but to practice these methods until there is a vaccine, etc. Failure to do so is magical thinking. Younger people imagining they are immune and that they are not responsible for the deaths of others is magical thinking. 

Imagine what a pickle the US would be in if we faced an epidemic of a pathogen that is bloodborne or waterborne? Like Ebola or cholera. As a nation, we would fail utterly because so many of us are incapable of understanding the science and instituting the protections."
2020-06-11 02:37:44,"Did Sweden figure it out first? (1) There are severe limits to containing a virus without a vaccine, and (2) You can't ask people to stop living. By living I mean the emotional, social, and working side of life, which is more than physical preservation from disease. Public health officials did their job as they understood it and they acted with good intentions. They also drove us crazy with a prolonged stay-at-home policy and helped tank the economy for 330 million people. I will never again support the kind of across-the-board shutdown that we experienced in April."
2020-06-11 02:40:51,"I hope what I see will not come to be. 
    I wish you fortitude endurance compassion and wise decisions."
2020-06-11 02:40:12,"Trump's attention span for anything that doesn't directly benefit himself or his *beliefs* is about 30 seconds. once he realized that no one was going to fall down and worship him as the savior for the completely inept way he dealt with the coronavirus he lost interest and has gone on to something more important: people falling down and worshiping him at a national convention. at least we know how that one will turn out: he'll be the nominee and hundreds or thousands of delegates will get covid, and many will die. maybe him, too."
2020-06-11 02:41:19,"Its summer and Coronavirus COVID-19 is going away nowhere fast and as I said it was not going to but that is not what some experts trying to tell US. The vaccine is not coming to our rescue until cows come home. Only 1 vaccine candidate is close to the finish line in a couple of months then comes the hard part, finding gullible people to get the vaccine when it will be once again time to get the seasonal flu vaccine.

So what are the choices if you are an adult under 55? Get back to work if you still remember what it is that you did and continue doing whatever has kept you safe so far. If you are over 55 and cannot get out of bed, pay a little more and get home care and rent a ventilator to stay alive if you are confirmed positive for COVID-19 and get a nurse practitioner who makes house calls and is in contact with a certified infectious Disease specialist. For God sake avoid nursing home care unless you want to commit assisted suicide. 1 out of every 3 persons who has died with or without COVID-19 has died in a nursing home in the past 3 months. 

All those claiming that humanity has been saved by business shut downs and lock downs are just making up numbers to fool people into thinking that there is some robust science that supports that. There is not. It is fake mediocre science making several assumptions. If after all the 110,000+ deaths in the USA and the over 2 million confirmed cases anyone is going to tell me that lives were saved than you must think I am a fool."
2020-06-11 02:48:32,"To contain the virus we need to set up parameters and borders.  The country needs to be divided up into 4 different sovereign states. 
South of the Mason/Dixon can be called the country of ""trump"". The North East can be called  the country of the ""Cuomo brothers"". The midwest up to the Rockies can be called the ""nice"" country. The west can be the smart, financially independent, progressive ""smart"" country.  Set up the borders now and the virus will be contained mostly in the country of trump."
2020-06-11 02:36:05,"He (trump) having the attention span of an ant got bored with the virus and turned to his most favorite subject, himself.   For several days we've been hearing virus cases are on the rise, but not one word from the White House.  I heard a TV ad about how  well the country is doing.  I thought it was a joke from one of the late night  comedy hosts.  But no, turned out it was just trump self-congratulating himself as usual."
2020-06-11 02:41:55,I guess no one knows yet whether asymptomatic people can transmit covid19 but we are suppose to follow the rules until they figure it out.
2020-06-11 02:46:35,"Three things are beyond debate: the virus still lurks in our midst, it spreads easily, and a vaccine is not imminent.  And it still kills.  

Against this backdrop, if Trump or Biden held campaign rallies remotely on the scale of recent protests, critics would justifiably skewer them for unnecessarily endangering public health.  

Unless I am missing something, my fellow Democrats, right or wrong, now own a likely resurgence of the virus and the political consequences in the fall.  

I hope I'm wrong but fear that by November when it counts, Trump the evil genius will have played this perfectly."
2020-06-11 02:50:17,Journalists should stop trying to use an increase in cases as an argument against re-opening.  Virus cases will continue to rise.  It's highly contagious and we're testing many more people.
2020-06-11 02:56:12,People who won't pay attention to common sense will learn how it went in 1918 for others of their ilk.
2020-06-11 02:59:07,"Excerpts from The Spectator:

Norway is assembling a picture of what happened before lockdown and its latest discovery is pretty significant. It is using observed data – hospital figures, infection numbers and so on – to construct a picture of what was happening in March.

But the Norwegian public health authority has published a report with a striking conclusion: the virus was never spreading as fast as had been feared and was already on the way out when lockdown was ordered. ‘It looks as if the effective reproduction rate had already dropped to around 1.1 when the most comprehensive measures were implemented on 12 March.

This raises an awkward question: was lockdown necessary? What did it achieve that could not have been achieved by voluntary social distancing?"
2020-06-11 03:11:22,As testing increases more cases will be revealed. The important thing to watch is the number of deaths which are not increasing.
2020-06-11 03:42:12,"WHO said asymptomatic transmission is ""very rare"" but then changed it to ""we don't know,"" so this provides a strong basis for decision making going forward."
2020-06-11 05:10:05,"These last 3 months have served one purpose: as a dress rehearsal for the Covid-19 show that is to come.  Unfortunately for the U.S., however, given the galactic ineptitude of this ""administration"" in handling any and every  aspect of the pandemic, coupled with Trump's malignant determination to revive the economy at all costs for the sole purpose of enhancing his re-election chances, the dress rehearsal hasn't put our country in any better position to deal effectively with the coronavirus.

Another 100,000 deaths or more by the end of 2020 seems like a reasonable prediction."
2020-06-11 03:42:43,"The rise is inevitable - it’s incredible to see people not following basic safety measures. Can we sue the Governors and companies who flaunt the guideline if our surgeries and lifesaving healthcare is once again disrupted? New delays mean fewer healthcare graduates, fewer skilled workers, more school closures. The GOP is now the Marshmallow Party - with brains to match."
2020-06-11 09:34:34,"""Inside the White House, Mr. Trump has attended significantly fewer meetings and briefings with the coronavirus task force, according to senior administration officials. He has begun plotting his return to the campaign trail, even as cases are climbing in key swing states.""

This is good. Without Trump at the meetings maybe the task force can have intelligent discussions about the virus."
2020-06-11 10:00:52,"I knew this would happen. The president only cares about being reelected. He doesn't care about the common people only about him and his rich friends. Wait until he has his big allies and all the people will come there unmasked and not practicing social distancing. People are very impatient. It took a lot of hard work for NY to get where it is today. The pandemic will go on for a long time, longer than anyone can imagine because of our president and impatient people. Hopefully things will be OK in NY, but things will never be the same. I don't know when I will go out to eat in a restaurant, go to a movie or get my hair cut again. And I don't care. I want me and my family to be safe."
2020-06-11 03:32:30,"“As the pandemic’s grim numbers continue to climb, President Trump and lawmakers in both parties are exhibiting their usual short attention span.”


Let’s pray that the virus turn into the likes of the H1N1 flu of 1918 flu which infected 500 million people – about a third of the world's population at the time. The death toll may have been anything from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.

Short attention spans from the Trump administration isn’t what we need right now."
2020-06-11 03:33:14,"It is not surprising that the GOP administration is now concentrating on re-election business rather than our pandemic. If we had good leadership, both could be accomplished.  Since rump is only a one trick pony, he can only do one thing at a time. Regardless, his dream of a second term is not going to be achieved. He messed up the Pandemic response completely. 
The police brutality confrontations are turning badly for him because he is siding with the cops. Brilliant huh?"
2020-06-11 09:35:56,"I'm glad to see the Covida-19 map back on the front page where it belongs. In recent weeks, it has become almost as difficult to find as the truth in a Trump tweet. If it doesn't remain prominently displayed, at least it should be easy to find. Thanks."
2020-06-11 03:48:06,Are infections rising or are more people simply being tested? The fact that coronavirus deaths are falling rapidly (as reported by The TImes recently) seems to indicate that the latter is the case
2020-06-11 07:28:18,"It isnt just Trump or Washington or Republican governors who want to pretend that the virus threat is over. Turn on the news, any network, and what do you see? Protests. Endless hours of live coverage of the protests. Commentators talking about the protests. How protesting is ""bigger than"" the virus. How not protesting for fear of contracting the virus is shameful (""silence=violence""). The attention span of the media has been interrupted and moved on to the next round-the-clock news story, racism in America. The pandemic is over in the minds of Americans. But, of course, it's far from over."
2020-06-11 03:49:45,"So every single time Trump brought up how outrageous China’s actions were in alerting the world about the danger they knew, the left and the media completely sided with China, Because it’s a drastically interfered with the narrative they were pushing that the coronavirus was all Trump’s fault. Now that the EU is entering the fray, the left and the media can no longer ignore it.  The fact that China shut down all travel within its own borders is evidence it knew how outrageously contagious and deadly this virus was. But at the same time, China allowed Millions of its citizens to get on flights to destinations around the world. And when countries like Italy and the United States said they were banning flights from China… China fought hard against that—say that was an overreaction and there was nothing to worry about. The evidence suggest China purposely took steps to ensure this virus would spread around the world knowing the cataclysmic damage to economies and widespread death it would cause. If that’s not an act of war, I don’t know what it is."
2020-06-11 06:46:45,"Unmindful of corona deaths and protests after Floyd's death, business as usual at the White House. Yes, Trump is already started  his preparations for the coming Presidential elections. President Trump plans to hold his first rally in months on June 19 in Oklahoma. No social distancing rules are going to be observed. And Trump, in particular even will not wear his facial mask. He is more worried that people may not recognize him in mask."
2020-06-11 03:10:53,"The media providing cover for the protesters the past two weeks on COVID spread is going to come back to haunt them. Trump will host rallies and encourage more and more economic activity. When the media criticizes his actions and rhetoric, and focus on the risk of spread, he'll rightly point out the hypocrisy of the media's unbalanced coverage of the issue and it will be red meat for his base and many moderates who are annoyed by the media lecturing at this point. Score one for Trump in this case."
2020-06-11 03:43:01,"Talking about a second wave is ridiculous when the first one isn't over yet by any rational criterion. This nation seems to have given up and admitted defeat against this virus. Tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands more of the elderly, weak, poor, and the vulnerable will be sacrificed at the alter of capitalism so that Trump can say ""Look how great the economy is!"" in November."
2020-06-11 05:08:03,"Only in this country has public health, like science, become so politicized.

Even with over 100,000 deaths, I am hearing an angry radio caller bemoaning the ongoing restrictions in NYC vs the total nonchalance in Florida, and how the latter is ‘normal’, while ignoring the consequences of such behavior. In the same breath he complains about protesters (all labeled as looters and thugs) not following social distancing (even tho they are masked), which I suppose implies in his mind that the virus doesn’t exist when the left’s activities are concerned (preferring to ignore they might be risking their health)

Finally, the worst is his ongoing conspiracy claim that “all this will disappear as soon as the election is over”.  No reasoning can be applied when ideology and self-deception rule over common sense and reality, and that is the saddest thing about our current divided society.  And if there is a conspiracy, it is the one that creates and keeps on perpetuating such warped worldviews, the ultimate irony."
2020-06-11 09:17:03,"Nothing could be more obvious that the fact that we -- both the US and the world -- were unprepared for the entirely predictable, inevitable pandemic.

It wasn't ""new news"" when Laurie Garrett published her important 1995 book, ""The Coming Plague."" We even got dress rehearsals with SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1 outbreaks. But despite the inevitability of a true pandemic, we weren't prepared.

 And when the next, inevitable and possibly much worse pandemic spreads across the planet, we still won't be ready. Somehow, evolution never instilled in us the willingness to look ahead and plan for uncommon but inevitable global disasters.

If and when the current pandemic subsides, the world will breathe a collective sigh of relief and go back to pretending that it won't happen again. But there is nothing to prevent the next pandemic -- and there will be a next pandemic -- from being far worse.

Perhaps, the next pandemic will be just as contagious as COVID-19, but like MERS it will be devastating to all ages.

The other thing that is certain is that the stupid and selfish will still be among us in distressingly large numbers and they will still be stupid and selfish, preferring their ""right"" to occupy government offices or hang out close together at the beach to protecting their neighbors."
2020-06-11 04:21:30,"Americans by the million no longer trust science or empirical truth. They no longer trust expertise. They are prone to believing, well, anything. Shame on the USA for spending trillions of dollars since 1990 chasing ghosts across the Middle East and not funding our education and health systems, or our crumbling infrastructure.
 
Instead we stumble into the future, broke and broken, suddenly looking truly weak as a nation. But in adversity comes opportunity. The black led protests have kicked open a door of opportunity for everyone seeking to create a more just and sustainable world."
2020-06-11 09:56:34,"If we can riot, we can definitely run the economy."
2020-06-11 04:51:58,"The Democrat Governors and Mayors threatened to jail ofr fine those who violated the stay at home order but thought nothing of allowing 100s of thousands of protesters out on the street.  

Also we should blame President Trump who has been in office for three years when the cities that have been controlled by the Democrats for 30-50 years have police forces that have officers that are alleged to be bias.  The Democrat mayors hired the police chiefs and they and their staff hired the officers.  Still has to be President Trump's fault.  The Democrats and media are a farce."
2020-06-11 03:41:09,Every covid headline features a worried public health expert warning of a next wave that curiously never seems to come. On June 1st  we were supposed to have 3k daily deaths and 233k daily new cases according to a NYT headline on May 5th. The 1st came and went with 720 deaths and 21k new cases and has fallen ever since. No updated NYT headline though. Instead we have Children's Hospital of Philly promising an apocalyptic rise in deaths by August 1st with millions of new cases over a couple weeks. It's become some source of amusement watching disappointed epidemiologists a manufacture ever more Byzantine models in hopes of finally justifying their incompetent overheated prognostications.
2020-06-09 16:12:12,"Question- are you quarantining? If it's required in Vermont, are you doing so?
I just got back to my country and am on mandatory quarantine for two weeks with my daughter- we take our temp on a digital thermometer twice daily and photograph it and whats app it to our health department contact. For those that can't quarantine at home (other family members in the house etc) our Government has set up a facility to do so. No testing unless we become symptomatic. And we've spent the last three months in Miami on our own meeting nobody apart from the nice gentleman from Whole Foods delivering our groceries. So the only infection point would be the airport or flight down."
2020-06-09 16:18:00,"Anyone who thinks airline travel has ""changed forever"" is simply ignoring the long history of airline travel.  Sure, middle seats will remain empty for now.  Sure, food will be the lowest possible quality for now.  Sure, airports will be empty for now.

In China, luxury goods sales during May were up year-on-year.  Consumers are consumers, and airlines need to make profit.  As the virus becomes part of everyday life - and it will - consumers will gravitate towards the best values in air travel.  For some, that's higher quality service. For some that's lower seat prices.

But consumers consume.  Marginally viable airlines may fail, but in the US Delta and United will be fine.  And airport restaurants and stores will reopen.  Consumers consume, and air travel has become one of those things the middle class in the US consumes."
2020-06-09 16:52:15,So much travel was just 'consumption.' It wasn't necessary in any way. It won't be missed by me.
2020-06-09 16:56:57,"I flew at the end of April, to Florida to care for an elderly parent.  I found it to be extremely stressful, even though Southwest did their usual professional job.  It was like being in a science fiction film, such as ‘Contagion ‘ or ‘The Andromeda Strain’.  However, it’s a good reminder to keep your hands away from your face prior to washing even in normal times.  And the lack of lines was great."
2020-06-09 16:58:05,"What I’m most curious, and have seen nothing written, about is how passengers will be protected from TSA screeners?  I fly approximately 100x/year, or at least I did until March of this year, and in the past 10 years have been selected for “enhanced” screening approximately 36% of the time.  “Enhanced” screenings often involved very close physical contact, with the TSA screener’s breath in one’s face, on one’s neck, required recitation of all the steps sending clouds of droplets out in a steady stream around the traveler.  They probe wounds through clothes, bandages and bandaids, run fingers under any sort of jewelry, etc., so I can’t imagine they’ll permit passengers to be protected by a mask.  And even if they do, unless the government provides screeners with masks capable of preventing transmission of the right-sized molecules and the screeners wear them properly, and the screeners change their gloves routinely after touching any passengers or items and refrain from other body parts touching the traveler, this strikes me as a huge danger to travelers.  I feel that I can protect myself on a plane if necessary, but I’m really concerned about the checkpoints."
2020-06-09 17:01:52,"Sounds like Jack Ewing lucked out on his flights.  Maybe because he was flying from Europe. 

Reports here from travelers on domestic flights differ greatly, suggesting that in the good-ol' USA, passengers are packed in like sardines if they can sell the seats, and not one airline company is enforcing the wearing of masks.  

You must raise your seat backs and tray tables to protect yourself, but as for the health of those around you ... well, everyone is on their own.  I can happily give up coffee and tea on a flight, but I'm not willing to give up my health and, potentially, my life to fly.  

Airlines tell us routinely that flight attendants are there for our safety, but until they enforce basic safety precautions on their airplanes -- for themselves and for their passengers -- it appears there will be no real safety in the friendly skies until there is a proven vaccine."
2020-06-09 17:22:59,"Flying WAS once routine, and enjoyable. It became a feat, an unpleasant and often difficult one, about thirty years ago, worsened after 9/11, and became intolerable after the 2008 recession. I fly only when it's absolutely necessary, never electively any more."
2020-06-09 17:23:50,Thank you for sharing your experience - truly useful for those of us who are considering air travel in the near future. It used to be that travel was something  exciting  that one looked forward to; now it presents life and death dilemmas.
2020-06-09 17:25:21,"This was a discouraging story. I travel frequently for work and am *not* looking forward to reduced 'perks' and additional inconveniences, as if there weren't enough already..."
2020-06-09 17:31:38,"My local airport with its one gate and one baggage carousel tried to expand over the last couple of years from a couple connecting flights to Phoenix to 8 dailies including additional ones to Denver and Dallas.  But it could only make these work with govt grants and subsidies.  Now it's back to 3 flghts a day and that's completely subsidized by CARES act money.  When this handout runs out, one has to think that the big airlines and the govt are not going to think that subsidizing continued flights here are that important.  It will be part of the eventual downsizing which makes sense because it was only able to ""grow"" on borrowed money to begin with.  I suspect that this is true in a lot of other places as well."
2020-06-09 17:35:49,"A bit depressing but all comes to an end. Now we know how good we had it.
I was a frequent flyer to Europe - for pleasure. My last was in February just as this started. Of course the uncomfortable flight is the least of the problems; the headache is on land, with different rules in every country."
2020-06-09 17:37:21,As frequent travellers our leisure travel has come to a complete stop. Until there is an effective vaccine no more flights. No more cruises. No more restaurants. As seniors we cannot risk our health.
2020-06-09 17:43:19,"I flew Saturday and yesterday, to visit a family member in hospice. BOS-ATL-BOS, on Delta. 

We found the airports and airplanes spotless. The airline and airport employees were also very cheerful, unexpectedly patient and embraced the new normal. In BOS everyone had on masks. Pedestals dispensing no-touch Purell we’re everywhere. The bathrooms were very clean. 

The flight was “full” by current standards, meaning 50-60% of the seats were occupied. No middle seats. The gate agent did a lot of heroic juggling for families. On boarding, we were greeted with a wipe for our seats or hands and a mask if we needed another one. 

In flight, Delta handed out a snack bag filled with water, granola bar, Cheese-it’s and wipes. There was no other contact with the flight attendants except to dispose of trash. 

Everything else on the plane was normal. The flight was super fast because there is so little air traffic. 

Upon landing in Atlanta probably only 50% of people were honestly using masks. Many travelers and airport employees with the masks in their chin or neck or hanging from an ear. There was hand sanitizer available everywhere. 

I found it much less stressful than I was expecting and would happily do it again. Still safer than driving, and once settled into your seat it was perfectly fine. I had my mask on the whole time. Delta really seemed to have their act together."
2020-06-09 17:44:40,"We retired a few years ago and had lots of transcontinental trips planned but I cannot see us doing any traveling until things normalize a lot more. From our perspective, if public settings like airports and planes are risky enough that masks are required then I really don't think I want to be cooped up on a long flight in such an environment. So we are probably not going to travel long distances until a vaccine comes out. It is what it is; not much we can do about it. We are just thankful to have our health."
2020-06-09 17:46:04,"Thank you for sharing the experience. What still remains unclear to me is how the EU-US travel ban is structure. US citiezens and Green card holders are allowed (although is not reccommended) to travel to EU. However, are EU citizens with a US working visa (HB/L/E) allowed to visit their families in Europe without having the risk of being denied entrance in the US upon their return? There seems to be a lack of info on that topic."
2020-06-09 18:08:05,We took a 12 hour flight home in early March just as the drawbridge was coming up.    The flight was packed but the airport otherwise empty.   I thought at the time that that would be my last international flight for a few years.   And I still think so.
2020-06-09 18:10:25,"Once again, I can say that I had the best of things in life. I've traveled to all the places I really wanted to, and while I would have liked to have done more (I chase eclipses), I was about ready to hang it up anyway.  

I don't miss the years when my first/last name, very common, apparently matched a terrorist, and I got the third degree before every flight, even having the head of airport security check me out in Schiphol one time,  causing me to almost miss my flight. Note to security people: middle names are often useful for comparisons."
2020-06-09 18:18:15,I won’t fly again unless wearing a mask is required and enforced. Full Stop.
2020-06-09 18:27:26,"We used to travel domestically at least three times a year and internationally, probably two times. Last flight we took was to Spain in February. Even though the virus apparently was already there, we made it back safely without knowing that his major outbreak was happening. I am so glad my wife discouraged me from going to a soccer game. I can't imagine how different our lives would be today if we had gone and contracted the virus.

I know I am going to miss our travels for at least another six more months or so, although I would feel more confident about it with a vaccine in place. I am also concerned that once it goes back to somewhat ""normal"" it would just add more time to the screening process as different countries have different protocols.

Also, I believe the entry process needs to be changed. The amount of people being right next to you, as any traveler knows, is unsustainable today. 

This is one year I will miss our travels but it is a small price to pay so that we could help conquer this virus. There will be other vacations, other summer places to go to as times goes by. We are thankful we are healthy and safe. 

I can't begin or even attempt to comprehend how the flight attendants are coping with this situation as they are constantly exposed to so many people. They deserve our gratitude."
2020-06-09 18:29:54,"In a strange way, I used to look forward to my long haul flights all the way to the southern most tip of India, all told about 20 hours flying. It was my time away from the daily grind of work, from social media, even from dog walking and even from my wife, who appreciates the break from me I suppose. And it provided me the only real way to still go see my folks each year. Those are the things I still look forward to.

The flights - in Qatar Airways - mostly was comfortable, and I do not lightly dismiss the insane safety record of the airplanes these days, or the speed with which we can get to the other side of the world. 

But the time spent in the airports are the worst - even in some of the luxurious and well maintained hubs in the Middle East. And now, the strangeness of this entire activity when they finally open it up. It might be a year before it makes sense to fly with the quarantine rules every where."
2020-06-09 18:35:13,I wish you'd addressed the problem with airplanes and the risk aerosol transmission of the virus - just some note of it and how it did or did not impact your decision to fly.
2020-06-09 18:58:55,Our son just flew Delta from Atlanta to Scranton. Delta's provision for precautions against the spread of COVID-19 is to keep the middle seats (B and E) unoccupied. That's equivalent to having a smoking and non-smoking section in an airplane cabin. All it takes is one major cough or sneeze through cloth masks to infect an entire cabin.
2020-06-09 19:01:42,"I will be flying to/from Frankfurt soon, quite often I hope now that the EU is slowly opening.  Lufthansa is offering some great fares and I'm happy to oblige.  Not worried in the least.  I've been amused at the many ""those days will never come back"" stories in the media in recent months.  I guess they need something to write about, but I think most will miss the mark and the vast majority of industries, air travel being a big one, will return to normal, if but slowly."
2020-06-09 19:13:18,"My sister just flew from LAX to Newark. While they tried to keep middle seats free, they didn't succeed. They were not enforcing masks. I was trying to fly from Indianapolis to NYC. I was unable to locate a flight that did not involve at least six hours of traveling and one change of plane. Some of the proposed routes offered thirteen hours of traveling (not including getting to the airport early or getting from the airport) and most were overnight flights. I drove (12 hours). I didn't want to spend hours in four different airports where they weren't enforcing masking."
2020-06-09 19:17:43,"Wait, after cleaning his area on the plane, he is holding on to the escalator rails with an ungloved hand? 
I have always avoided that germ ridden area not just in airports, as much as possible, even before the pandemic!"
2020-06-09 19:26:17,"My worst experience at Frankfurt airport was the random security check nonsense required by the TSA (American Govmt.)  I don't remember exactly what all had to come off-- shoes, jackets, - but the problem was that one other person was being checked concurrently and the bins were not being segregated.  

Having once walked off with someone else's computer post the sec. clearance/patdown  - I realized it when I was in line to board a plane -- I am now very cautious about keeping all my stuff tog.  The person to whom the Apple computer belonged was very grateful.. The TSA agent at the Lost and Found area was convinced I was a criminal.  wipe down; turn on computer etc.   
People were marginally helpful.  And I made my flight.  So far as free coffee and tea -- it's usually not very good anyway.  Eating nothing on a flight might mean you lose a half a pound on your way to your destination.  In the 1960s  - when one could smoke on a plane, food was good, service was nice... and were seats bigger or was I smaller??"
2020-06-09 19:40:50,"One of my goals after my retirement last year was to travel as much as I can. I had plans to travel to four countries this year. But all that changed with the pandemic. Do I miss the travel? Yes! But I’m just grateful to be healthy. The world will be there waiting for me, but not until a vaccine is available."
2020-06-09 19:43:24,"""There was something strangely enjoyable about traveling through a deserted airport. ""

Doesn't seem strange at all that the absence of noise and crowds of a busy airport would be enjoyable.

The best part though, is that a deserted airport means far less fossil fuel use.  Let's hope it's a long term trend as people realize their choices have real impacts on the environment.

But, I suspect it's just a hope.  We humans have demonstrated over and over that we will sacrifice long-term societal benefits for our own immediate gratification of even trivial desires."
2020-06-09 19:45:44,"WOW!  What a difference six months make AND a deadly, global virus.

My husband and I were at the Frankfurt Airport in December, returning home from a beautiful, exciting. enjoyable two week holiday vacation.  We too flew Lufthansa.  The food was exceptional awesome, the flight crew was even better and more awesome (especially after my husband got air sick in the middle of the night, in the middle of the flight).

Both the airport and airplane were filled with travelers, excited because of that time of year.  I don't think I ever saw so many colorful packages or people trying to cram them into their luggage, en route to their holiday destination.

But would we fly again today, this year, this decade?  I don't know.  We've talked many times about returning to London where my husband is from, but we don't feel comfortable flying.  After the horrific experience we encountered over the weekend in Wisconsin with 99% of the folks we saw did NOT wear face masks nor adhered to the 6 ft. social distancing requirement, coupled with airlines putting out mixed messages of face masks were mandatory but flight attendants were told to not enforce, we cannot help but fell there are still too many areas for concern regarding our own health and safety.

London nor Germany aren't going anywhere, so if we wait a year or two before flying again, that's okay too.  But I can see the comfort in flying with hardly anyone on the plane or in the airport.  That would be pretty sweet."
2020-06-09 20:11:55,"As a fellow Vermont resident, it's nice to know our Health Department is doing its job and checking in on recent arrivals to make sure that quarantine guidelines are understood. Of course, if you drive into the state rather than fly, no one is going to have any idea you arrived ..."
2020-06-09 20:12:53,"I've flown three times in the past month and found, like the author, the airport an oddly enjoyable experience. I had the feeling of walking through an art gallery or a museum of massive steel birds that might as well be sculptures. A hushed silence filled the cavernous ceiling of the terminal, proper and respectful with a tinge of fear. While the patrons kept to themselves, the flight attendants were a joy to interact with, finally not overwhelmed by the usual load of work. 

Practically, I found 100% mask usage in the terminals as well as the airplane cabins. I suspect that the media has inflated the few dissenters to sell clicks. In these perilous economic times for most, I wish they were a little more circumspect."
2020-06-09 20:17:20,"The longer the inconveniences and fear last, the more airlines will disappear. Hopefully we will get to the point where enough supply disappears that when demand starts growing there will not be room for everybody. Fares will go up. Garbage tourism, defined as going somewhere to get a selfie and post it on Instagram, will disappear. The benighted masses will find something else to do that can be done from home. The planet, its natural, historic and cultural treasures, will be the great winners of the pandemic."
2020-06-09 20:47:02,"Even before the pandemic, I vowed to never fly again. Not because of illness, but because airplanes put so many climate changing gases into the atmosphere.

Pandemics—except of species extinction—are among the least of our longterm worries."
2020-06-09 20:47:17,"That's the problem with this pandemic, the utter inconsistencies with each airline, each airport and frankly each state. I just flew in from London to LAX. A row of  airport staff/immigration officers greeted us, adorned in full mask, face shield and gloves.All I was asked was, had I recently been to China or Iran and was I feeling well ? No and yes, I stated. OK you can go, was the reply. I almost feel cheated of a proper interrogation and temperature check. What crisis?"
2020-06-09 20:52:53,"Have been used to travelling a lot for both business and pleasure. But haven't gotten on a plane since January. Likely not be on one until next January. 

Really miss it, but won't risk it."
2020-06-09 21:02:00,"I have the opposite problem, family in Germany I want to visit. I usually go in April, that didn't happen, they were coming here in August, that won't happen. Now I'm hoping for October. Skype is a wonderful thing, the youngest grandchild looks so much older in just a few months from the last visit. Another year and he'll be a different person.

Of course many families are facing much worse and Mr. Ewing made it with minimal fuss. Since 9-11 travel has not been easy. I now have two cards to get through lines faster but even though can keep shoes on jackets and scarves and purses removed is still a hassle.

But honestly, empty planes? I crave that so I just may see if they'll let me in the country. Bad food? I'll bring something. Mask on? Ugh but maybe can sleep.

I'm used to the hassle of travel but now the countries I want to visit have closed their borders to me. That kinda hurts. But who can blame them? At least I traveled a lot last year so folks, don't procrastinate when this is finally behind us. That bucket list won't check itself."
2020-06-09 21:06:30,"I’m going to be a fish out of water for a second and state that loosing airline travel will not be the end of the world. In fact, it may save the world from terrible pollution at altitudes the earth may never recover from.  There will be difficult decisions and choices to make over the next few decades to enable saving the planet and air travel is one that is a no-brainer.  With technology there really is no more good reason for business travel by air; tourist travel can be accomplished by the old fashion way of travel aboard ships."
2020-06-09 21:10:11,"Thanks again for the NYT for an interesting story.  I used to travel every other week to China, and have many fellow co-workers who traveled till January of 2020.

What struck me was the absolute lack of detailed follow-up or test.    Given what we know and how much we don't know, it is amazing the lack of vetting of passengers before departure, upon arrival and even follow-up.  Is it a surprise that the US has one of the worst set of infection rates, deaths even though we have such richness and resources, absolute continued failure of any national strategy/policy."
2020-06-09 21:11:15,Flying has been made too cheap and too easy.  It's allowed a comparatively small number of comparatively wealthy people blow through enormous amounts of carbon and has led to over-tourism.  Let travel be special again.
2020-06-09 21:28:19,"My wife and I were to fly to Frankfurt next Sunday, to see our two German former exchange students and their families. Then we were planning a river cruise on the Rhine. The trip was pretty much paid in advance. Now, maybe we can go next fall-- or maybe next spring. One issue with this is that I am 68, and I can't go until I think it is really safe.

And Mr. Ewing's airline meal sounds like one I had on a plane in China in 1994. The ginger chicken had more ginger than chicken."
2020-06-09 21:53:44,"Thanks but no thanks. I'm done flying to distant places for shocking amounts under excruciating conditions. The experience of air travel has become progressively more miserable and chaotic for the many, while the wealthy few rack up miles and memberships and bask in luxury. Hyper-tourism is rapidly killing off all of the interesting world sites anyway. Our addiction to relentless diversion combined with our fetishization of bucket list living is destroying our culture as rapidly as fossil fuel based travel is destroying our planet. Perhaps we can learn to deal with our restlessness in more productive ways than mindlessly consuming other peoples' cultures, neighborhoods and lives so that we can have something to post on our social media accounts. In the future, it is my fervent hope that air travel becomes something safe, expensive and rare."
2020-06-09 21:54:47,"I truly wish Lufthansa will be up and running in the near future.
I have been flying Lufthansa for many years and it is a superb and reliable airline .
It’s personnel is outstanding and schedules and service impeccable.
I have a ticket with Lufthansa from Miami to Frankfurt and , as mr. Jack Ewing stated , it has been impossible to contact the airline booking service to change the date of the flight."
2020-06-09 22:05:29,"Alaska Airlines just sent me an email to reassure me that flying with them is safe. They said they require crew and passengers to wear masks, but no indication as to whether there's any enforcement of that rule.

They said they're restricting the number of passengers so as to keep occupancy below 2/3. Until the end of July, that is, after which - evidently - the sky is the limit.

I usually fly around 20k miles on Alaska Airlines each year. Not a whole lot, but even so, I'll wait until they make a much much better attempt at keeping it safe before I fly again."
2020-06-09 22:19:08,"I'll pass on rolling the dice.
The plan before Corona was to visit my siblings in Europe.
I booked an RV and a few Wisconsin State Parks instead. 
A summer spent locally feels more like 2020 anyway, which is shaping up to become a historic year like 1968 for our generation."
2020-06-09 22:27:32,"The State of Hawaii has a strict 14 day quarantine for all visitors and returning residents.  The quarantine is taken quite seriously and those who don't obey the rules are fined heavily - $5,000 = and anyone who intentionally or knowingly breaks quarantine can be convicted of a misdemeanor or incarceration one year.  Most who get caught are heavily fined and returned to the Mainland or abroad ASAP."
2020-06-09 22:28:27,"Flew from Mexico to Chicago last month. What a relaxing journey. We were the only ones returning a rental car that day. Nobody rented one. Almost all of the 30 or so people at the airport for the 4 flights that day were going to Mexico City, not the US. You no longer need to fill out a customs form on the airplane, just use one of the hundreds of empty kiosks. Walked right up to passport control. There wasn't even a single US customs official on duty. It felt like the golden age of air travel."
2020-06-09 22:29:42,"Our family commutes by plane weekly, and we'll happily start again in a couple of months when the fall semester starts.  Not much to add here.  Just wanted to counter the dozens of ""I'm terrified and I'm never leaving my house again"" comments with a different perspective."
2020-06-09 22:29:55,"Thanks for this first-person account! I'll be flying at the end of the month-- a permanent move back to my home state, CA-- and have been worried by some of the stories and comments published here. This was actually reassuring. Still, I believe no one should be flying now unless they absolutely have to."
2020-06-09 22:33:24,"I guess the author didn't fly United much pre-pandemic. I flew United out of Frankfurt a lot: that's their typical meal. Fresh rolls in coach? Ha! Plastic wrapped food served by sullen staff saying ""chicken or pasta"" with no other description. Those WERE the good old days!"
2020-06-09 22:49:18,"I had a similar experience flying through George Bush intercontinental shortly after 9/11. My brother, now an artist, commented on grand interior space. You rarely see grand interior spaces empty. The feeling is both simultaneously odd and satisfying.

At the same time though, I'm hardly surprised. Emily St. John Mandel predicted as much in ""Station Eleven."" A pandemic destroys the world. Ironically, a group of survivors find themselves spared the disease because they were stuck in an airport terminal during the end of flight.

Personally, I grew up under some of the most heavily traffic skies in the world. You could never count fewer than five airplanes in the sky provided the sky was clear enough to count. I sometimes wonder what living there would feel like without the rumbling sound of jet engines.

Perhaps flying never should be the same. If the journey is worth making, perhaps you should spend more time getting there."
2020-06-09 22:52:39,"Never? Please.

Once there's a vaccine, life will return to normal fast. Humans have very short memories."
2020-06-09 22:55:36,"High risk demographic here.  I returned from abroad in March.   Customs and security spread the available pathogens to all comers.  Precautions were farcical . I spent the next two weeks self-isolated and fearfully expecting to end up in the hospital.  

Now I get anxious going to the grocery store.  I might have a panic attack on a plane, especially if someone started to cough.  A full face respirator might do the trick, but I'd probably have to take it off for security theater."
2020-06-09 23:09:24,"It would be a simple matter to evaluate the risks of air travel as well as the effectiveness of protective flu protocols:

Simply ask air all travelers to report their state of health 2 weeks after every flight.

Simple

This is easy to implement, does not entail increased encroachment on civil rights, and FINALLY gives an accurate assessment of the risks of a specific societal behavior."
2020-06-09 23:10:23,"I'm getting frustrated by articles claiming ""_____ may never be the same"", and then offering little to no rationale to backup that statement, other than the generally accepted human reality that we can never know for certain how things will be in the future.

I understand that the psychological pressure of the current pandemic really weigh on people's ability to imagine the future in a positive light, but I also think it's counterproductive and alarmist to keep suggesting that drastic changes to certain facets of life are inevitable. It's silly that only now we've begun to make these candid declarations about how different the world might be in x number of days/months/years.

Air travel changed a ton after 9/11. But that's because 9/11 was perpetrated largely thanks to the ability for four planes to be successfully hijacked simultaneously; something that I think (hope?) would be mostly impossible today. Despite the changes, air travel was generally recognizable in 2006 compared to its equivalent in 1996. Was the food maybe better, but the seats definitely smaller? Sure, but that had nothing to do with terrorism, just like any changes to air travel in the coming years will likely have little to do directly with COVID-19, aside from the obvious economic impacts that might change the way the industry operates.

This is a historically bad pandemic, and it has undeniably impacted air travel immensely. But it's just the latest crisis for an industry that has weathered many storms."
2020-06-09 23:12:21,That was as discouraging a thing to read as anything that Fauci says. Let's hope his guesses are just that... I like the coffee and rolls.
2020-06-09 23:19:10,"There's nothing preventing me from booking and taking flights now and in the immediate and distant future. The airlines do the job. People have family to visit, places to go, things to do. and the airline industry will adjust to our needs."
2020-06-09 23:23:16,"Hate to say it, but reducing flying is a good thing. It's bad for the climate and difficult to replace high energy-density fossil fuels with other fuels on commercial flights. Biofuels aren't a solution as it's not clear that they're better than petroleum.

The more we travel, the faster pandemics spread globally. Less travel means slower spread.

I'm ready to forgo flying. It has been an increasingly miserable experience (at least in coach) for years now. This is all just icing on the spoiled cake."
2020-06-09 23:33:42,"I was hoping to read about what it was like to get through Immigration and Customs upon arrival, to know how it's being handled. I'll also be heading home sometime this summer. But you didn't mention anything about the arrivals process - aside from having your temperature read.  Was it crowded?  Could you maintain distance? Were people wearing masks in the terminal?"
2020-06-09 23:34:35,"""Flying may never be the same.""  Hallelujah: let us hope it is never the same profoundly uncomfortable, unhealthy, polluting, gas-guzzling, over-priced, inefficient, time-wasting, equity-destroying, nerve-wracking failed service business.  Airlines are a commodity like a commuter train or subway and should be organized and regulated like one, with open comfortable seating and fixed, affordable everyday low prices.  Readers may enjoy my opinion on this in the 2 April FT: ""Intriguing Possibilities For the Future of Air Travel.""  Regards."
2020-06-09 23:36:45,"This pandemic isn't going to last forever. We'll be back to normal in 2 years, tops. We'll either have a vaccine, or people will have moved on to the next shiny object. Maybe both."
2020-06-09 23:40:41,"I recognize the Sheraton hotel in the photo of Frankfurt airport. My wife and I had a reservation at that hotel when we flew from Mallorca to Toronto on March 18, just as the severity of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming clear. Germany closed its borders to air travellers that day. As a result, my wife and I were not allowed to enter Germany, which meant we were unable to get to the Sheraton, or even to collect our luggage so we could check it onto our flight to Toronto the following day. We spent a cold and uncomfortable in an airport corridor. Our luggage arrived a few days after we got home, the lock on my case having been destroyed by the Canada Border Services Agency, who evidently thought the books inside were some kind of contraband. We never did get a refund from Sheraton. And I’m sure the airport is where I picked up the (thankfully mild) case of covid that developed three days after I got home. All in all, a bit of a rougher trip than your correspondent endured."
2020-06-10 00:03:07,"What caught my attention: ""To my relief, it turned out that immigration was looking for someone with a name vaguely similar to mine but half my age."" I assume that means there was no problem or delay. 

Not like 10 or 15 years ago with the TSA continually delaying a black man who flew regularly because he had the same name as a wanted member of the IRA. The fact that one man was American and black and the other was Irish and white was not enough to convince TSA agents."
2020-06-10 00:08:04,"I have heard my footsteps in Frankfurt (When my plane landed early 5 am) !  Nice photos, thanks for sharing"
2020-06-10 00:40:41,Thanks for sharing this.  I see no upside to any of this; international travel is likely ruined for ever.  Or maybe for a bit longer than that.
2020-06-10 00:45:48,"Great article Jack.  Although I'm uneasy about international travel, my profession would not allow anyway."
2020-06-10 00:47:14,"Covid may be the proverbial straw for unfettered air travel.   Lot of travel may not be worth the total cost in terms of environmental damage, etc.     Now people may only travel when it is ""very necessary"".    If this kills off the deluge of discount airlines, that may not be bad.  Personally, I will travel internationally for key supplier meetings in Asia.   But I will probably take business or first class to get some social distance, wear a mask the entire flight.   On flights to Asia, some of the passengers are suited up in ""bunny suits"" like what are worn in electronics clean rooms, and they also have N95 masks and googles."
2020-06-10 01:07:38,"As much as I like to travel the upside of all this is to remove air travel from the list of culprits for climate change and, as we now painfully know, virus transmission. Perhaps we will see innovation in fast sailboats, or failing that, a return to the long cruises of the past....a natural form of quarantining provided no one gets sick.
As for business travel...there is much to be said for face-to-face....but it is also expensive, wasteful and replaceable. I flew on one of the last flights of the Concorde and thought that plane was glorious until I realize what a disaster it was on so many fronts.
In any event...I am going no where I can't walk, bike, or drive to for a long time...but I will always have Paris....in my memory."
2020-06-10 01:10:58,"For the foreseeable future, if I can't drive to my destination, I'm not going.  It's way too risky to be cooped up in an aircraft, three abreast, breathing the air re-circulating through the a/c system.  Even if you're wearing a mask, do you really want to squeeze into the lavatory, and touch surfaces that may have been contaminated by a sick fellow passenger?  If I could fly on a private jet, no problem, however, that is not likely to happen anytime soon."
2020-06-10 01:20:31,"Much too much worry and panic ... 'everyday' air travel will return. ... and shrink-wrapped, inedible meals were par for the course on U.S. legacy carriers pre-C19 ... nothing new there ... airports will be crowded, planes will be full, and for better or worse,  the vast majority of us will forget C19 ever happened ..."
2020-06-10 01:21:45,"My mother is dying, so I flew to Bay Area and back over weekend to see her for the last time. I flew Southwest, and booked six hours before I left. Easy and cheap. Getting a flight out on short notice on a Friday normally would be difficult. (I probably would have had to drive in the Before Times - a 14  hour trip.)

The actual travel was a joy. Found parking place in first row I tried. Almost no one in airport. I’ve flown Southwest a lot, including several years as A List. As much as I like their boarding process - more straightforward - it was always stressful, with people, including me, jostling and jockeying for position. None of that. We boarded in orderly groups of 10. No worries about space for luggage in overhead bin. No seat mates to accommodate. 

Only thing that took slightly longer was security on return flight, because TSA Pre line was closed due to low volume. 

Most restful airline trip I’ve ever had, at a time I could sorely use it."
2020-06-10 01:38:45,"Forgive me, I had to laugh: 'less crowded flights and no stiff fees for changing flights.'  HAHAHA. 
The airlines didn't use the huge Republican tax break to make planes any better for its customers and merely enriched themselves. DITTO for the pandemic stimulus of billions of dollars that went to their pockets. The customers will never see any changes, i.e., more room or less crowded flights, less fees. Are you kidding?  This quiet moment is only a lull for intrepid travelers. Once people see it's no big scary deal to fly again we'll be back in the thick of deja vu airline travel. I bet ticket prices and fees will be higher though under the guise of 'due to the pandemic. . . '"
2020-06-10 01:40:12,"Of course, Normal air travel will return in a year or so, but the trauma left on Airlines and the airport will never be forgotten. 

That comes from again our own arrogance.

When I travel to Seoul ,  Seoul Airport was already doing what we are doing today. 

Airline traffic will return no matter what but not next week, next month, in 2021 summer, yes.

We will fly with what will survive. 

I believe many aircraft and some airline companies will be gone for good.

Just an analogy,  Coronavirus pandemic is the asteroid of the airline industry, It may be the same way, dinosaurs have gone bit avians will prosper."
2020-06-10 02:33:17,I flew the week after Sept 11 and the airport was not quite as empty but similar.  Then I flew to Paris 2 weeks later and the plane was about 10% full.  We all had our own row in which to sleep.
2020-06-10 02:38:33,"A friend's daughter returned home to Seoul from the US about two weeks ago. She was tested for coronavirus twice on arrival at Incheon airport. Once with a nasal swab and later with a throat swab. Both were negative so she was directed to download a location app on her phone then guided to her waiting parents. She was told to quarantine at home for 14 days. Health officials called her daily to check her health. And a very loud alarm went off on her phone if she didn't move it enough inside the apartment. 
That's the way it's done if you travel to a country that has committed itself to contain coronavirus. Coronavirus deaths in South Korea so far: 276. US deaths: 111,979."
2020-06-10 02:44:45,"Well, it seems the airlines, and many other businesses, are going to have to come to terms with the mask thing, i.e. maybe different flights for mask-wearers and non-mask wearers; or, separate sections, like with smokers and non-smokers; different hours; different lines, etc.

I'm already sick of the whole situation. If the experience your business offers feels hairy, scary and uncomfortable, I'm not  your customer anymore. 

It's untenable to force people together into confined spaces and allow some to disregard the others. A business with a mask-optional policy has NO policy, as far as I'm concerned, and they're not taking this global, lethal, highly contagious disease seriously."
2020-06-10 03:01:10,"Flying to Aruba at the end of September. Really do not have any concerns. Will wear mask during flight. Island will open in the next couple of weeks for international  travelers with restaurants, stores, casinos, etc, open. Got a great fare for two in March with United with provision of cancellation without any penalty. We all have to overcome this fear and move on with our lives."
2020-06-10 03:01:36,"I have to confess that I am getting tired of these ""never going to be the same"" articles. It will take time, but humanity will beat this virus. When people are confident that's done, they're going to want to, say, travel again. Travel is just like going to restaurants, riding the the subway, going to watch sports, etc. People still want to do these things. Right now they are afraid to, and justifiably so. But as we are seeing with the agitation for premature re-openings, people can hardly wait."
2020-06-10 03:10:30,"Systemic changes are afoot. People and companies have learned that many trips are non-essential. Remote meetings and working from home are here to stay to a significant degree. The longer this goes on, the more communities and people will be forced to adjust to a new reality where mass tourism isn't a reliable source of income. Airlines are on the brink, and a reckoning is a certainty. Cruise lines, hotel chains, car rental agencies, etc. etc. A widely available vaccine that is actually distributed to the majority is at least 2 years away. Then there's the impact of a general, deep recession that will be around for a while. Honestly, I'm much more concerned about the knock-on effects in terms of conflicts and political instability, which historically follow these sorts of events."
2020-06-10 03:33:22,"Jack,

My situation exactly with a few twists. My husband and I on sabbatical in France from January 7-July 7 2020. On March 6, I flew home for a family emergency. My return flight was March 31, but one week home, the travel ban was put into effect. 

I've been trying to get back ever since, and when our return flights from Paris to the US were canceled, my husband finally gave up. He could no longer fly out of Paris. Bordeaux to Amsterdam, to Detroit, to Salt Lake City.

Three months.

Hopefully, I will see him this Saturday!"
2020-06-10 03:57:09,"This is all just too bad. After reading about all those packed domestic flights with many passengers not wearing face masks, I booked my son a train ticket from Ann Arbor to Los Angeles. It took 52 hours but there was plenty of room for social distancing, and he got to see a big chunk of the country. He loved it!"
2020-06-10 03:57:33,"Aren't we all getting a little paranoid? I know I am, and it's not a good thing. Today someone aggressively shook my hand. I had a fleeting thought about rejecting the offer, but it happened so quickly I really didn't have the chance to withdraw. Now I am all upset with myself for putting myself at risk.

While caution and prudence are reasonable responses to the current public health crisis, we are going to turn ourselves into germaphobes and hypochondriacs if we keep this up for long.

I have been watching some nature videos lately. It's fascinating to watch primates engage in social grooming. Close physical contact is part of what creates bonds among primate communities. Humans are primates, lest we forget. We have a desire to be with others. Withdrawing from communal activities is going to have a deleterious effect on the collective human psyche.

As for infections and contagions, humans have survived for as long as they have because they have built up immunity to a wide range of potential pathogens. To say we may have to live with Covid-19 for a long time is a phrase that has multiple meanings, both figurative and literal."
2020-06-10 04:04:26,"After years of being treated like a steer heading for slaughter, I have no sympathy for the airlines. It will not be too long before they once again pack us in while saying they are not doing so. The business model is so broken. I am beginning to get daily emails for low cost flights--the exact opposite of what should be happening. Seats should be spaced out and fares raised to make up for lost revenue. The readers who comment that things will go back to the way they were are correct and that is a shame."
2020-06-10 04:49:43,"Traveling domestically is a breeze.   Almost no scheduled flights are cancelled, every plane lands early, the airports are empty, security lines are short, seats at the gate plentiful, and the vacant middle seat in the cabin provides elbow room and a good place to store some stuff.   As for wearing a mask, that is probably advisable even after the pandemic has passed.  Who needs a preventable cold or flu."
2020-06-10 05:00:11,"I absolutely fly for leisure and I literally cannot wait to go abroad again. Until that opens up though domestic travel it is! I’m kinda lucky to live in a country that is fairly big too explore but problem is it kinda lackluster... after some time. 

My only wish though is to have two passports since being stuck in the USA does get very boring after awhile."
2020-06-10 05:14:12,"There are basically three types of long-distance plane travel: business, family and tourism.
One positive result of the pandemic is that business travel will be cut to the bone. With few exceptions it's an unnecessary luxury in today's world.
Family travel will resume, though probably with less frequency. Those who used to travel to see Mom three times a year may cut back to once or twice.
That leaves tourism. I love to travel internationally but it's undeniably true that it's gotten out of hand over the past decade. There were far more people traveling than ever before and that is the real cause of the virus spreading so far and so fast.
Tour groups and cruises will suffer as people prefer to spend less time surrounded by strangers. Perhaps the independent traveler who does all their own booking and seeks less crowded destinations will be one of the few winners when the dust has settled."
2020-06-10 05:28:44,"Will they finally get rid of the rebooking fees and higher fares on exchanged tickets that encourage sick people to fly? Early this year I flew cross-country next to a man, who, it turned out a short ways into the flight, had a very bad cough. Later that week, I got sick. Tested negative for flu, but ended up with symptoms that were shortly thereafter identified as the classic COVID symptoms. (No tests for domestic travelers in those days, so I'll never know for sure.) I bet I wasn't the only one who got whatever that guy had.  I'm guessing he knew he was sick before he got on the plane; if it didn't cost an arm and a leg, perhaps he would have rebooked his trip. 

Honestly, we've all been putting up with this problem for years. Not every sick person runs a fever. Some people think it's ""just a cold,"" then go coughing up a storm on everyone around them. Until it becomes easy and cost-free to rebook a ticket for a few days or a week out, people will always try to fly when they're sick, and it'll always be risky."
2020-06-10 05:38:29,"I don’t care if I never fly in a plane ever again.  I can’t imagine a more confined space where everyone is breathing on each other’s recycled air!    Flying was never pleasant with everyone packed into those narrow seats.   But now, it’s impossible to distance from others.   There needs to be Covid19 tests required by law in the boarding area and anyone that’s infected not allowed to fly and spread the virus.  It should be required by law nationwide by all airports and airlines.   If the airline industry wants people flying again this is the only way to do it so passengers feel safe and the virus is not spreading from city to city."
2020-06-10 06:32:07,"Jack is lucky being an American flying into America. When I return to Korea, even though I have residence there, I will have to self-quarantine in a country that takes the virus seriously. Plus, within 48 hours of returning to Korea, I must get a health check-up before getting on the plane. The coronavirus is serious and the Koreans are taking to that way."
2020-06-10 06:45:07,"Flew out of Newark on a packed flight to Europe, almost all non-US passengers newly unstuck from 3 months in the US.  One hard part was Terminal B was completely devoted to checking in just two flights.  Ours took 2 hours.  After that, no line at TSA.  In Europe, no line at all for Immigration for non EU passports, and not much of one for EU passports.

One surprise:  no English language movies or TV on the entertainment system, so only 13  movies in all.  I'm guessing the licensing fees on all those movies were too easy to cut."
2020-06-10 07:13:09,Might be best to call United next time if you are flying on United. What an ordeal on your flight. Hard to imagine anything more difficult than no problems.
2020-06-10 07:21:31,"Thank you, Jack for a great piece. In the 2000s I was a frequent traveler and went through Frankfurt Airport dozens of times. One Friday evening during the Christmas season a massive snowstorm shut down all flights into Frankfurt. About 100 of us Frankfurt business passengers, tired after a long week at work, sat glumly at the gate in Brussels watching the snow come down. The lights slowly went off at all the other gates until we were the only ones left... even the team at the gate counter disappeared, which is never a good sign. At some point one of our group put a laptop on the counter, opened it up and started playing Christmas music. The music echoing through the empty airport was hilarious, absolutely absurd and put a smile on everyone's face. I remember thinking, there has to be a better way."
2020-06-10 09:18:58,"I flew out of Chicago Midway Airport on  Saturday March 7, 2020. it was packed like Christmas/ Thanksgiving.  It took me nearly an hour to get through security.  

The flight to Las Vegas was more empty than usual. The middle seats were mostly all open. As I sat in my exit role aisle seat, I noted that folks had plenty of room.  I have family in Henderson and therefore fly there regularly during the year to see them.

I returned on Monday March 116, 2020. McCarran Airport was emptier than I have ever seen it.  And the return flight was as empty as my outgoing flight.  And Midway Airport was a ghost town."
2020-06-10 09:39:34,"""Travelers can only hope the pandemic will also bring some positive changes, like less crowded flights and more freedom to change flights without paying stiff fees.""

Talk about wishful thinking. The Airlines are losing Billions. Who do you think is going to pay for it?"
2020-06-10 09:47:19,"If the changes, now temporary, become permanent, one thing is clear.  Airfares are going up, up, UP!!!   And service quality and frequency is going down, down, DOWN!!!

While it would never happen, wouldn't it be great if part of the pandemic stimulus money were spent to build a decent high speed rail system in the USA with inter city trains that cruise at over 150 miles per hour, as is common in western Europe."
2020-06-10 11:11:54,"I think that the lockdown taught us a lot. We don’t *need* to consume as much as we do. Shopping had become a leisure activity, flying a spur-of-the-moment  and very cheap weekend thrill. At the beginning of lockdown hoarding became a thing. As time progressed we realised (or at least I did) that we don’t need much to be happy. People and nature are the important things. Slow living, walking, music, games, talking, books, community and looking after each other provide all the sustenance we need for a good life and happiness. The three-month breather will have changed us inherently. I am hopeful."
2020-06-10 12:36:40,"Jack must have been at a different Frankfurt airport that I travelled thru.  I transited thru on 27 & 30 May and the airport was surprisingly busy -- about 75% of normal with most shops and conveniences open.  4 Lufthansa flights, 4 flights at 90%+ capacity.  Forget social distancing and I was the only one disinfecting my airline space and hands.  
However, be prepared for our journeys to take much longer than in the past if you are travelling anywhere besides between the top 10 major transport hubs.  My trip in May to 12+ hours one way and 19 hours (including an overnight) on the other leg for a trip that normally takes 3.5/4 hours door to door.  Europe to the US can take up to 36 hours and overnight stays."
2020-06-09 20:00:44,What about using the bathroom? Is this the most dangerous place on a plane? Someone please comment.
2020-06-10 02:10:19,"Most of my flights over the past few years have been between Raleigh, NC, and NYC.  Considering the total time door to door why bother to fly rather than drive or take a train?  Not to mention the 737Max and Boeing's flagrant refusal to even following wiring separation issues until caught."
2020-06-10 05:38:47,"A country only has so much flexibility until the number of infected people forces a shutdown.  Stupid people who refuse to wear masks and socially distance eat up that capacity.  This requires the rest of us to make up the difference by severely restrict our activities to stop a catastrophe.  It is such selfishness that makes this country have one of the highest death rates and infection in the world.  If our rates were more like Japan or Denmark, we would not have to worry much about flying.  Instead, we have over 20000 NEW cases every day.  Thanks Trump.  Very SADD!!!"
2020-06-09 17:05:28,Just wondering why Jack thought it was a good idea to touch the escalator with his bare hand.
2020-06-10 00:53:08,"I have been flying since 1966. Dc3 props, those transport ones in Vietnam where you stood, 707's and on...1st Class, Business, Economy. Being in Music Biz, I have been on Private Jets, all kinds of small hop planes, Jets, Props and Semi.

The Only ones I enjoyed were 747's. I would book the last 4 seats in Economy, lift the arm rests, lay down, strap myself in and tell the stewardess not to bother me until I called for her.

Wake up the next morning wherever I have landed refreshed and no jet lag."
2020-06-09 19:25:07,"Flying was, “never the same”, long before the virus struck!"
2020-06-09 22:33:20,"This isn’t a pandemic story, but it took place during a transfer at Frankfurt.

During the long walk/ride between terminals, I somehow — through my own stupidity — managed to exit the secure areas.

So I had to go through security yet again. The young agent examined my carryons and asked me a few questions.

I should’ve answered in English because my German is elementary, at best.

The young man was trying to determine what I was wearing on the chains beneath my shirt. He became exasperated and began to shout at me.

I pulled the small chain from my shirt....and showed him my Star of David.

He froze. I froze.

But he bowed his head and said, “It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.”

Of course, he was just a young man; perhaps his grandparents were alive during the Nazi era.

It was a poignant moment for both of us."
2020-06-09 18:36:26,"Burlington, VT's a nice town; but, if I were you, I'd pack my wife and daughter off to Germany. Even without the pandemic it's a preferable country to live in."
2020-06-09 20:44:46,Are there any insights here?   I couldn't find them. Seemed like a lot of words with little to say.

However, where is the explanation and/or proof for the anxiety triggering byline ""Long-distance travel may never be the same?""

That was the reason I clicked on it. Was it the reason you put it there? 

Times are very difficult on all of us. You have to be very careful when you claim you know what the future holds."
2020-06-10 02:21:13,"Ahhh, the good old US airlines.... 

Who've shown matchless contempt for customers over the years, used every trick in the book to trick flyers into paying more that they think when they book a ticket, crammed people into seats in flying sardine cans, and used taxpayer bailout monies to reward their investors and provide windfall hauls for their CEOs.

It's sure hard to feel sorry for such an industry and the greedy fatcats who run it."
2020-06-10 02:33:59,"It is believed that infection is possible through the eye and on a more crowded, longer flight, eyeglasses and possibly goggles are probably advisable. It seems weird I know, but according to epidemiologists, it's possible.

2020-06-09 18:06:33,"How many times have you flown, only to be seated next to someone coughing and hacking, or perhaps sniffing their nose nonstop.
Taking temperatures of boarding passengers should always be done.  Let's hope the practice never stops.
If there's any reason someone is denied boarding, they should of course received a full refund, immediately, and given preference to fly after a period of X days."
2020-06-09 22:57:26,"Perhaps the author should be invited to write a piece about the effects of his frequent-flyer lifestyle on the health of our climate?

A round-trip from Frankfurt to NYC pumps 2.0 tons of CO2 into our atmosphere.  The author has apparently never reflected on that fact.  He is far more concerned about plastic seat trays and wipes (most of which end up in our oceans)."
2020-06-10 06:13:17,"Question to the writer; was it just the booking process that was a feat? Regarding the actual travel, the article reads as though it was relatively comfortable and at times enjoyable to fly during this time, and personally I’ve take an empty airport and empty adjacent seat at the cost of an immigration check and some fresh rolls"
2020-06-09 21:36:53,"I love Paris, was there last in October and would return this summer but that is now impossible. France still excludes non-EU residents and the airlines are so capricious that I have no idea what to expect and am not willing to risk it.
     
I thought of a Rocky Mountain train trip as an alternative but Canada has also sealed its borders. Maine instituted a 14-day quarantine for new arrivals so that idea is dead -- as is Maine's largest industry.   



On a cheering note, I shopped at Target (the O.C.) yesterday and one-quarter of the shoppers did not wear masks, store policy notwithstanding. I say ""cheering"" because we have been fed so much faulty information (e.g WHO) and been so tyrannized by governors who will allow people to go mask-free while looting but not when attending church that I no longer believe anything I am told. I lived through both the Asian Flu and Hong Kong Flue in, respectively, the 1950s and 1960s and deaths, overall, were worse (adjusted for population) than for Covid. Additionally, we did not exile the infected elderly to nursing homes -- might as well have sent them to Aushwitz.

I wish normal travel to resume and the abnormal hysteria to end. In the meantime, if the airlines aren't needed then we should stop subsidizing them -- what do I care if they go bankrupts if I cannot use them?

Wear a mask if you wish and wash your hands every five minutes if that makes you happy. Personally, I'd rather be in Paris."

2020-06-09 22:24:34,"Now let me tell you from an experienced flight attendant what it's like to fly now.  I've always been a germaphobe, so this extra precaution NOT to get sick has been a part of my life for the last few decades.  I do get the occasional cold, but cannot always blame that on flying.  I've been wiping down things in my hotel room as soon as I enter my room.  And using the lav on the flights? (I fly the European flights out of the East Coast) Don't use your bare hands to turn on the faucets. Use a paper towel to do that, and use that same paper towel to open the door of the lav.  Keep a spare plastic bag at your seat for your used Kleenex/paper towels.  Use your elbow to summon for the elevator.  Don't let another person touch the handle of your bags.  Wipe your hands after touching the overhead bins latch.  Pack your own food.  The reason airplane food gets such a poor rep is because it has to be laden with fats, sugar, and salt for it to taste like anything.  I am the flight attendant you want on a flight.  I am cheerful and helpful. But until we get an effective vaccine, we will have Covid-19 and even worse.  I will sadly be furloughed in October 2020."

2020-06-10 00:09:53,"Nice first person account and a welcome informative break from the hyperventilating febrile Times coverage of protests and Trump (“truth”, but not “objective truth,” ok then). Interesting how relatively lax states can be about quarantines and contact tracing. Other than the cheery phone call, and relying on the reporter to be honest, that seems to be it in VT. It seems different in HA - the velvet voiced Derrick Malama on HA public radio regularly reports on runaway tourists who broke quarantine and are hunted down by the police. It gets results - HA has done a good job staying ahead of the virus and keeping it in check. Different states, different approaches. America!"

Does a face shield help? Wiping down armrests is much less important (just wear gloves and don't eat), and wiping down the seat is irrelevant (the same reason you don't need to change clothers after visiting the grocery store).

At that point, flights were leaving about every fifteen minutes at peak times, checks of any form were all but non-existent, and I actually saw one guy pay for his flight on the plane as we were taxiing for takeoff.

Yes, flights are cheaper now, but the whole cost, much of it paid in wasted time, discomfort and inconvenience, means that the best days of air travel are for ever behind us. 

Perhaps that's not altogether a bad thing, since on this occasion we can be fairly confident in saying that it was air travellers who fetched us the virus before there is a vaccine. In a number of ways, mass air travel might be considered as ultimately self defeating."

No problems crossing the border from Germany to Switzerland. we weren't even stopped. The airport was completely empty, most lounges and stores closed.
Travel itself was easy enough. The mood though was eerie, on the plane, at the airport. Everybody on the plane wore masks, reminders all through the flight. A nervous tension through out. Everybody had to fill out tracking info, CDC people came on board, collecting forms as we left. Temperature was measured after immigration , with 2 CDC staff standing near by. I guess they would have separated you if you had an elevated temperature. No global entry, but no lines anywhere. So everything went smoothly. The empty airports both in Zurich and New York were strange though. Like out of a scary movie. Felt a bit like ""Lost in Translation"", a sense of isolation. It was foggy on the drive out to East Hampton, not much traffic. It added to the feeling of remove! Glad to be home for sure."

Wearing a mask is mandatory here from the moment you arrive at the airport til you leave at the other end.

Air Canada kindly hands out a packet consisting of a mask, gloves, wipes, small container of hand sanitizer and small bottle of water.

The downside of so few travellers? -- the fare was triple what it would normally be, and the lack of connecting flights required an overnight stay in one direction.  But all things considered, I'm grateful."

Increased air travel has been a nemesis for people on the ground too.

Last week, on a return flight from visiting my husband's critically ill brother (the only reason we risked flying), we caught a flight from the crowded Charlotte, North Carolina, Airport to Portland, Maine, on an American Airlines flight. We'd been told by a pilot we met that the planes were less than half full, often much less. But this one was packed. Only ten or so empty seats. Most rows were full, three across on each side. Most people had on masks, but not all, and not the children seated in front of us. Fortunately, we had found some N95 masks and kept them on. Now, feeling somewhat radioactive, we are carefully quarantining ourselves. One week down, one to go. My impression is that our experience is becoming increasingly common on domestic flights. Beware."

Frequent testing costs money. The money - and the time-  will otherwise come out of patient care. 

There is massive greed among some operators, but that should be handled differently ( perhaps along with the insane greed of the top execs at  Hospital and healthcare behemoths). 

But making testing this an issue will create the wrong reactions.  Once this is to some degree - under control - sure, vaccines should be covered for employees ( better yet we should have a universal health care program  - but that fight shouldn't get in the way of taking action now to assure that testing will be covered.

We are also required to go though 2nd test regardless of the fact that 1st test results are unknown.....so we could unknowingly be positive for week or more ans by that point the damage could already be done.

How is this woman going to afford necessities such as food, housing and transportation when she is going to take a five-figure hit to her paycheck?

In order to keep her job, Ms. Davis accessed a free testing site.  She bore the cost (time, transportation) and inconvenience of this process, but it is ludicrous to expect her to do so twice a week.

This illustrates the painful reality of healthcare in America.  

The whining and corporate obscurespeak from her employer, health insurer and unions is utterly ridiculous.  Their message is clear - we need a bailout to pay for this.

Until they get it, they should stop whining and pay for the tests.  They can tack the cost on to their bailout.

I can ascertain that most (but by no means all of long term care facilities) are mostly interested in assuring profit for the owners. In contrast most Academic Medical Centers have loses in several years, especially in years with acute medical issues, like this one. They manage their loses by moving them in future yeas, requesting assistance from state and federal governments and other means. 
Even in good years many nursing homes have been sited for deficiencies related to infection control (see Medicare reports). Many did nothing to prepare for a covid-19 outbreak until it hit their nursing homes and then blamed others. Most of the nursing home staff have minimal infection control training. Even today many long term care facilities do not have a significant stock of PPE/masks and want them for free from the state governments. Many are NOT prepared for a significant second wave.
I believe that they should be forced to pay for employee Covid-19 testing even if they sustain a loss for a given year.  There is no mandate to have a profit every single year!"

I say this as someone who is not a supporter for Medicare for All in general. The difference is that, unlike general medical care, whose benefits are private to the individual receiving the care, coronavirus tests are really about the health of everyone else, since they provide an informed way to isolate the infected, without isolating everybody. Plus, fiscally speaking, compared to general medicare, coronavirus tests are really cheap, and easily affordable to government that just spent hundreds of billions bailing out Big Oil."

What is the purpose of health insurance, if not to pay for necessary medical care and testing? Why do we allow insurance comapnies to decide whether or not they are going to pay? What good is health insurance if the company providing it refuses to pay claims? Why even have insurance, if it is useless? All an insurance company has to do to avoid paying is to claim that the treatment is not necessary. I've been through this myself, as a cancer survivor, battling with my insurance company to pay for tests my doctors order, but which my insurance company seems to think are unnecessary. Who decides what is necessary and unnecessary? Why is it legal for for-profit insurance companies -- which are not medical establishments, and are acting only in the interest of their CEOs' paychecks and bonuses --  allowed to second-guess physicians and deny claims almost routinely? By refusing to pay for necessary care and testing, insurance companies are creating an argument against their own existence, and an excellent case in favor of universal healthcare."

2020-06-09 17:09:30,"Three responses:

1) Ask this question: does the nursing home pay for the sanitizing products and the tools needed to clean and sanitize the facility to protect residents and staff from various health risks?  Answer: Yes.  Therefore, it follows that the nursing home should pay for the tests, which are simply another method used to prevent and detect another health risk.

2( Moving from the logic of the first response, this story emphasizes the need for a coherent, coordinated national health plan - yes, call it Medicare for all if you wish, but surely the confusion and disarray of the medical industry, from CDC, NIH, and down through state and local health care entities demonstrates the flaws in our healthcare system.  Thank goodness that my wife is an expert quilter, and made masks for family members and, along with other members of the local quilt guild, for residents of the VA home here.

3) If Republicans are OK with the taxpayers paying for Tweety's golf weekends (at his own clubs - doesn't he get free passes?) then they should be OK with taxpayers paying the tab, under a national health plan (see above response).

And it doesn't have 100% accurate but it must be a quick turnaround. Abbott can do it in 1 1/2 hours. Local facilities, including nursing homes and other high contact places, like schools and even shopping malls, can pool together, or even make deals with urgent care facilities, to design a protocol/regimen to do testing.. Or, if it is cheap enough, there are point of care testing kits coming out, akin to the home-pregnancy test.

There are two kinds: 1) A Genomic Test that amplifies the virus signal in the sample so that the virus can be directly detected; 2) An antibody test that measures the level of your immune response.

Evidently the exact same tests that we use to detect Covid-19 were used in Egypt in 2018 to test EVERYONE  OVER 12 YEARS OLD, 65 million people, to eradicate Hepatitis C where they had the highest rate in the world at the time.  Same reagents, same kit, just measuring something else.  The Egyption government paid US 5cents per antibody test and US 50cents per genomic test and I suspect someone made some money on the purchase.  With apparent corruption in our medical industry in America, patients/insurance are paying US $10-$20 per antibody test and up to $100 per genomic test.  There are laws against profiteering during times when the public is experiencing a natural disaster (think of hurricanes, tornados, floods, earthquakes).  Why can’t these laws apply to our pandemic disaster?  If this kind of profiteering is indeed happening, why aren’t people going to prison?"

 This comment is 'inside the box' that is of course there needs to be no insurance at all but that can be another discussion.  Tax payers pay for medicaid and Medicaid is the only thing paying for most long term care patients.  Medicaid is extremely strapped and it is no wonder as not only the costs so high but there is systematic abuse or at least taking advantage of the system.

This example and this would quell the problem in the first place has recently come to my attention.  At places where elders get rehab or programs like PACE, instead of providing the basic care supporting the purpose of said program-keeping the person at home and out of nursing home, they force the client to consume far more billable services!!!!!!!!!!  At pace they basically bilk or extort even more medicaid money antithetical to their purpose. That is they say the deal for the person to get the  in home service they need/want they have to consume/ go to the day center get therapy,  use their dr's etc-- thereby billing medicaid millions and actually taking the person out of the home!!!"

It needs to be a done nationally, its the only way to stop these unnecessary deaths of our fragile senior citizens.

2020-06-11 18:18:57,"I had the privilege of working for the Ford Foundation while McGeorge Bundy was president of that foundation. I well recall that when Bundy was being pressured by some more liberal groups to increase the level of grant making (circa 1978) he said words to the effect that we have no basis to assume that the needs of tomorrow will be less worthy than the needs of today. He went on to emphasize that ""we should be bending over backwards to conserve our resources so that the Foundation may also be able to address the needs of tomorrow"".

The current president, Mr. Walker, (and his board), may want to ponder the fact that, were it not for Bundy's wise stance some 40 years ago, he (Walker) would now be presiding over a very diminished foundation that would be lacking the resources to address the worthy needs of today that he is so desperate to fund."

The BLM has surfaced thousands of dedicated, creative, and uncompromising grassroots organizations that know the issues on the ground, have mobilized broad and relentless community campaigns for equity and justice, developed local support systems and services, and attacked racism and economic oppression embedded in local and state-wide policies.  Yet, these resources are little known to the established foundations like Ford and Carnegie.  Ford can lead by granting significant funding to broad community coalitions like the Communities United for Police Reform, a NYC coalition of 32 grassroots and established nonprofits that recently led the repeal of New York State's 50-A statute that conceals disciplinary records of the police.  Put the money where is can make a difference, not a splash."
2020-06-11 19:39:09,"While the creative commitment of additional resources by Ford and a few others is commendable and timely, the article omits 2 relevant critiques of how foundations operate. One thing many people don't understand is that the 5% payout minimum includes a foundation's cost of administering grants--the actual amount distributed to nonprofits is significantly less, and can vary greatly depending on foundation size and overhead.The other point is that of the estimated trillion dollars sitting in US foundation endowments, most of that is invested in the stock market without significant social, environmental, or governance (ESG) screening, meaning the bulk of foundation endowments are invested in giant corporations often contributing to the very problems their grants attempt to solve. Foundations need to be moving more endowment resources into impact investments that complement their grant efforts rather than cancel them out."

2020-06-10 14:32:49,"Two very contrasting & also little confusing aspects of recent development in India- rising prosperity for a section of Indian families;  along with declining social mobility for women That's very uncommon in the rest of the world.

India has a poor record of female participation in the workforce. ILO ranked it 121 out of 131 countries in 2013, one of the lowest in the world.

Household income, mainly in rural areas, seems to be increasing, financially stabilizing families. That is correlated to an increasing number of women delaying or denying joining the workforce. Larger response to income changes is among the poor, rather than the wealthy. Casual workers, mainly women, drop out of the workforce when wages increased for regular (male) earners leading to the stabilisation of family incomes. It seems that many Indian women worked due to financial compulsion and not because they enjoy gender equality or desire to have an independent income. The education they receive in India does not seem to boost that desire or self-respect. It's related to the religious nature of Indian society too.

Researchers found that having a high school education was ""not found to be an incentive for women"" to work. The lowest rate of participation is among those who had secured high school education in both cities and villages. The rate is actually highest among illiterates and college graduates. The incentive for women to participate in the workforce has declined as the country prospered."

Naturally, it became among the MOST RACIST countries in the world, along with Bangladesh and Jordan (Source- Washington Post) and that report came in 2013, one year before the current Indian Prime Minister, Modi, came to power in 2014. Since then the situation worsened at a very fast rate- both for women and other religious minorities. Keep in mind that the vast majority, more than 75%, of Indian Muslims and Christians were converted from lower caste Hindus in an effort to save themselves from the heinous caste system still very much alive and thriving under current ""Hindu Nationalist"" Govt led by PM Modi.

Few days ago this article apppeared in an Indian newspaper (Hindustan Times- ""Let’s Talk About Racism | ‘I am tired of being a black man in India"".

During the current BLM protests, WeChat has been seeded with racist posts and fake news about BLM protestors attacking Chinese individuals and stores, heavily amplified by misguided users.

2020-06-09 13:38:50,"Propaganda is just another form of war between US and China.  I am sure Chinese newspapers and news media also describe the same situation happened in here.

I like to read NY Times articles because of its extensive and thorough investigation of any subject. It is not a propaganda tool for anyone or even US government.  This is the strength of this organization.  Thus, many foreign readers also like to read it daily.

As more Chinese readers read NY Times, I am sure they also want to have unbiased reports from NY Times, describing both positive and negative side on any subject.  

The evidence of your current Twitter story is not strong enough to describe organized interference from China.  You just quoted stories from other publications or companies, but you did not show direct evidence.  Why not ask Twitter do their own investigation to determine foreign interferences. Let Twitter do the talking to show the evidence, and then you report it."

Its fortunes rise and fall based on how many of the above pay to advertise on the platform. The lemming-like behaviour of its users, a large percentage of them sock puppet bot accounts, matters far less. 

To combat disinformation campaigns, the news media can start by not parroting Twitter's marketing-speak about it being ""where news happens"", and taking a number of tweets on a topic and painting it as a sample of public opinion. Opinion polls IRL happen via phone calls, where pollsters talk to a human. Journalists on a deadline pulling a few random tweets can't exercise the due diligence necessary to understand if the user's account they're quoting is real or a bot. 

While you're at it, please also stop embedding multiple tweets into each story. Each embedded tweet contains tracking code that gives Twitter information about users who don't even use the platform, but do read the NYTimes."

Not only does the Chinese Communist Party control the minds of its own people, it now wants to control the minds of people internationally. Keep in mind this is a government that doesn't allow its own people to read the New York Times or speak freely but encourages its supporters to use free-speech platforms abroad to promote one-sided messaging. The subterfuge behind this is disturbing."
2020-06-09 14:39:34,"Let's be clear about several things:  China is not our friend.  They are positioning themselves to be our adversary.  Their unsanitary practices caused the COVID epidemic, their cover up in the early stages when it could have been controlled led to the worldwide epidemic.  China is a danger to the world.

We should not be rewarding China with our trade.  We should move our trade to other countries.  Given China's poor record of quality control, we definitely should not be buying masks, gowns, medical supplies of any kind or pharmaceuticals from China.  No Chinese electronics should be in our internet.  They all have back doors bigger than Facebook.

  Chinese nationals should not be in our public universities.  There are about 368,000 Chinese students in our public universities, many many of them are reporting everything they see and work on back to China.  We are educating the future leaders of our enemy.  In addition they are displacing US students because they pay a premium.  A publicly funded school is supposed to educate students from that state first, when that demand is completely filled, then out of state students, then foreign students, but not Chinese. 

It is past time that we stop enabling our enemy.  China has demonstrated time and again that trade, preferable treatment, will not deter them from attacking our interests.  We need to recognize that and cut them off."
2020-06-09 14:49:42,"The big question is how to start regulating social media effectively without crossing privacy/liberties borders. Twitter nowadays is nothing more than armies of aggressive overly engaged bots serving authoritarian leaders - see Trump. Bolsonaro and now, China."

I'm sure China must have learned from the Russian campaign in 2016. Trump election has cost China $ 100 of Billions and created difficulties for Chinese champions like  Huawei. China will be very active in these 2020 elections.  

Unless, banned from using it, China will take advantage of western social media companies, while banning foreign countries and organizations to use Chinese social media platforms.

This has to end. China has to play by the same rules. If the US government can't use Chinese social media platforms to address Chinese, China and the Communist party shouldn't be allowed to use US platforms."
2020-06-09 15:13:05,"Why is it assumed by China that anyone would pay attention to state controlled media output from a autocracy. They will literally say anything to keep their gravy train going, continuously picking the pockets of their population to benefit the chosen few. That is the main ideological path that Trump shares with China."
2020-06-09 16:27:37,"In 1894, an Australian intellectual, C.H. Pearson opined.

Until about 1870, China's GDP was the largest in the world. With a population of 1.4 billion, more than four times ours, but with per capita income of an eighth, a disparity the Chinese leadership is obligated to correct, their GDP is rapidly approaching ours. Their GDP, calculated by PPP, already has.
It is inevitable their GDP will vastly exceed ours, unlike the Soviet Union, which never came close.
Is it wise to start a Cold War with an opponent whose GDP will far exceed ours in a generation, especially since our populace more polarized by the day and our current leadership leaves a bit to be desired. A colossal understatement. 
We barely survived the last Cold War. Will we survive Cold War 2.0, with fewer allies this time.
On our present course, in a generation or two, the Chinese Navy may be conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
Wouldn't a wiser course be to accommodate China's rise and accept that 1.4 billion Chinese have more of a right to be at the head of the table than .32 billion Americans?
Maybe even a round table with a place for everybody."

Among these, I would not be surprised that many support their Govt in fighting back against the narrative the Trump administration is trying to spin. US Govt officials have been actively promoting the conspiracy theory that the virus escaped from a Wuhan lab, which has finally been discredited as highly unlikely by most scientists. But the scientists already came to that conclusion when Josh Rogin from Washington post wrote an article that elevated that theory from a conspiracy theory to the mainstream, which was then used by Trump and Pompeo and other Western Govt officials to launch their own propaganda campaign. Did major news organizations do their job at the beginning to debunk this theory? All they needed to do is to interview the scientists. But they did not, and they played along with the Trump administration officials in their propaganda. Let's face it. There is as much propaganda by the US govt with the media playing along. This cannot be ignored when we talk about propaganda from the Chinese side. If one follows the timeline, then one will see that it's American politicians like Tom Cotton who first started this propaganda war by promoting conspiracy theories."
2020-06-09 15:39:24,"It’s obvious that China is running a massive global propaganda campaign. What is frustrating is that American media, including NY Times, have not focused on the source of COVIT19. Meaning, the wet markets of Wuhan, where live wild animals were slaughtered, and where virus transmission  to human occurred. Not much has been reported on local corrupt officials, which allowed these practices to continue when Chinese scientists had been warning since the out brake of SARS in 2003 that wet markets are dangerous.  China’s corrupt officials help created the problem, millions became  ill with COVIT19 and thousands have died and still more to come. Yet these same gangsters, who help create the pandemic, go on social media claiming that they are here to help.

So I'll gladly push in the other direction. For all of China's faults, the US is just as guilty of everything it accuses China of doing, and China's at least nominally building socialism, whereas the US has no such plan.

They have lost any honor they once had and deserve no platform in the free world. No UN membership, no WHO membership, no WTO membership...nothing.

So of course China has to ramp up its efforts to control the global narrative to counter any suggestions that their Authoritarian rule is not welcomed, e.g. in light of its tightening grip on Hong Kong despite its joint agreement with the UK that nothing in HK will change till 2047."
2020-06-09 14:44:10,"Please investigate the China's notorious Water-Army. As long as you'd like to spend money, you can hire an army of  young or not so young,  but tech savvy people including some women who are nursing babies at home.  10-sent per-tweet, one does not need much except WI-IF, a smartphone, Starbucks ( in Coivd-19 world, staying home), then one could make some easy, yet patriotic money.  It is the same as Hong Kong's protesters. 10-dollars per hour, +exercise by walking and shouting.  The Chinese people would do anything to make money. 
To be honest, the tweeting war started with an insane Pr...t of the United States."
2020-06-10 13:36:14,"My MegaCorp had already been embracing open office floor plans, as it is cheap to cram four or five into a cubicle, sometimes thousands more when the ants came through a window in summer (really :( ).

There is no real plan yet to return workers yet, and I have no desire to give up working from home to go back to an hour of commuting, the theater of getting temps checked, and wearing masks for not an extra penny of pay. I'm producing the same work from home, why go back?"
2020-06-10 13:43:55,"Corporations have always sought ways to own their employees' lives - whether through pensions, other benefits you cannot leave,  building suburban neighborhood tracts next to offices, or building these ""campuses"" with candy jars, hair salons or even sleeping rooms (for those all-nighters one must pull to work there). The remote working move is just another form of this philosophy - if the technology is there to make it possible, in a cheaper and more effficient (because of less overhead to the company and because there is NO division of work/life - moreso than on these campuses - say goodbye to the little snoozing you got on the NJ Transit bus through the Lincoln Tunnel, you'll be up and working in your pjs by that time), why not?"
2020-06-10 13:45:28,"I am so tired of hearing this nonsense that open office seating is designed to encourage collaboration. It's designed to pack more people into a smaller footprint in order to save money on rent. Companies should just be honest about this fact. Besides, open seating arrangements do not encourage collaboration they encourage people to withdraw into themselves because it's the only privacy they can find."

2020-06-10 14:49:48,"Corporations can say whatever they want but open floor plans were designed to benefit the Corporation and not the employee. Once upon a time, the company I used to work for had set up individual cubicles with 6 foot walls / partitions for each employee. This was our personal work space where employee privacy was respected and I believe made us all the more productive. However, all that changed when we were acquired by another company. It did not take the new company long to switch to an open floor plan where the 6 foot partitions were eliminated, we were now less than 5 feet apart from one another and if anyone sneezed…watch out. The absolute worse was the company’s insistence that cubicles be shared by employees. It was a complete 180 from a healthily working environment and completely destroyed employee morale."
2020-06-10 13:36:16,why gummy bears?  that is just full of sugar anyway.  instead of snacks give people bonuses if they work beyond what is asked of them.
2020-06-10 14:10:45,"I am wondering what will happen when this pandemic will be over. Can we be back to  shake hands? Can I talk with someone without Mask? Beside, do you really like live like this? Zoom Meeting? all the time? Is this is the future?"
2020-06-10 15:04:36,"After nearly two decades of being an office drone, it's time to go write that Great American novel I've had in my back pockets. Cause I don't want to be in the workplace shown in those concept drawings. 

Let's agree: The office as a concept is toast. Corporate real estate, watch out. We're going to think of people being squashed into cubes in a few years similar to how we look back at the old tenements on the Lower East. How did they fit some many people fit into such small spaces?"
2020-06-10 15:08:09,You can see the misinformation at work. The comment that the droplets are on items on people's desk just shows how the response to the coronavirus has been mishandled. No one has said the virus is alive on items  such your desk that was from a flawed medical article in March and has been debunked by the CDC.

2020-06-10 15:08:58,"It’s asinine companies are spending so much time and energy on all this when, for most of us, it’s much easier to continue working from home until we know more about the virus and (hopefully) a vaccine.

Why would anyone want to go through what another commenter deemed healthcare “theatre” just to sit, masked, at a desk, in a sterile environment, with only a subset of your cohorts, mentally processing every small action you take throughout the day? It all sounds completely exhausting.

IMO, regardless of the virus outcome, the future is remote work and companies ahead of the curve on this will be the winners. My wife and I are in our 30s and, while we love our jobs and are well-paid, have zero ability to buy a home and start a family in an expensive tech city like Seattle. Flexible remote work provides a liberating unlock many in my generation desperately need, never mind the savings for employers via real estate, recruiting, etc."

2020-06-10 19:04:29,"Yep, an end of an era.  With all of this mitigation, going to the office will be a big hassle. Best to just work from home (for the 1/3 who can) at this point. If work is still getting done—just work from home."
2020-06-10 19:08:55,"If we had offices with DOORS this pandemic might not have been as bad as it is now. This is how offices were in 1993, lol. Plus, with all the temp checks, wiping down your desk, etc. along with a commute, how much actual “WORK” will get done. Much easier to just wfh imho. You’ll burn up two hours of your day following these guidelines. I know it can’t be helped, but this will cut into doing “actual” work and cost a mint to put in place—let alone enforce—not to mention the unprecedented liability issue. I don't think transforming the American workplace into a Golden Corral COVID-19 buffet is the answer."
2020-06-11 05:10:42,Good.  I'm so glad the open-plan office nightmare has backfired on these companies.
2020-06-11 05:27:01,"This is just too funny for these companies. They have too much time and money. There isn’t social distancing for healthcare workers, from reception, nursing staff, medical assistants, and physicians. Our SHARED workstations are exactly the same. Computers are next to each other. We eat at our desks, face masks off. Communal gummy bear jars? Please. We are lucky to have Keurig coffee machine. Sure, the patient rooms are wiped down since they are the customers and we are just providers."
2020-06-11 14:35:53,Will all this be necessary after a vaccine is found that works?
2020-06-09 11:07:34,"I never use these apps! I love talking to the local restaurant people directly.  They get to know us over time, and they appreciate our business. 

It's like the private insurance industry in health care - they take a huge chunk out of the pool of money available, making everything so much more expensive for patients and physicians. This is killing independent clinics/practices in America, as these apps are killing independent restaurants.  

When ""boxed"" style anything is your only option, over time you lose on quality, independence in thought and money, and ultimately are guided by one size fits all recipes. 

This is all about fragmenting our money, our healthcare our interactions... so it becomes more complicated (as it pretends to offer simplicity) and more money leaks out to a middle person/company, a leech,  who is not essential and ultimately is not really invested in the exchange!"
2020-06-09 11:12:30,"Typical ""dot com"" service business model.  Greed followed by more greed, with a lot of lies mixed in.  Preying on small business ""partners"".  My business tried Groupon years ago, was not a mutually beneficial relationship.  Apparently, we weren't the only small business to have that experience.  Groupon stock today is $1.77, and probably overpriced at that."
2020-06-09 11:14:52,"The deceptive practices are more of a problem than anything. Once again, an online industry lies about how it is making our world better then it scurries for cover when a light is shone on it. Fake news on closings and alternate facts on phone numbers and there you have their business model."
2020-06-09 11:18:34,"I do not use these apps for 2 reasons:
1. I value my personal data.  It would be nice if there was a report on on how they use personal data.
2. They fees to both user and restaurant are outrageous.  Why not report more on the fees charged to restaurants?"
2020-06-09 11:28:25,"When I do get food from a restaurant I pick it up.  A delivery driver is just one additional person handling my food that i don't need. And when i order , I am doing it to keep local businesses afloat. Sounds like these delivery companies don't realize if the restaurant can't stay in business, they will have nothing to deliver."
2020-06-09 11:34:15,"I pity restaurant owners, most of whom are passionate about providing a service to the community, now that ""community"" is a dangerous and potentially deadly thing.  

The delivery services mentioned herein are typical of parasitic opportunists that emerge in times of chaos and panic.  But then again, I was always astounded that people ordered food to be delivered in the first place.   The last thing in the world I would do would be to eat food brought to me by some guy on a bicycle.  

My girlfriend and I have a few places we used to love to go to, but we are each 60 and stopped eating out in late January because of the dangers of doing so. We make periodic trips to the grocery store and we each have refined considerably our basic culinary skills.  I highly recommend it."
2020-06-09 11:37:43,"For those of us lucky enough not to live in towns or cities, it has been wonderful to walk in the evenings and pick up dinner. But now after reading this article, I will do the same for rainy and colder evenings. Our local restaurant owners/servers recognize us; we chat,and it is as close as we can get to being in their restaurants once again."
2020-06-09 11:41:06,"A simple glance at the prices on a restaurant's website and then the price for the same item on the delivery service's website provides another incentive for not using these services: they jack up the prices for the consumer as well! 

So many services like GrubHub and Caviar are hailed as innovative tech startups. Their main innovation is figuring out how to be middlemen."
2020-06-09 11:43:53,"It’s interesting to me that while restaurant owners complain about this, I only heard about one restaurant that actually asked their servers to become delivery people. That was a win-win all around. I think restaurant owners are very on innovative still when it comes to figuring out how to serving the public. They basically ignored the delivery model as long as they could and then blindly signed up when they had to. Like everything else the smart business person will figure out an effective way to navigate the future. I realize chefs are not necessarily great innovative business people, but they better be coming our way soon"
2020-06-09 11:48:01,"Of course this epidemic changes things but normally if I'm paying full restaurant prices for my meals I'm GOING to the restaurants and taking full advantage of the facilities and features which restaurants offer, i.e. atmosphere, service, clean-up."
2020-06-09 11:53:39,"I think it's another case of corporate greed. It's taking advantage of the business that was most affected by Covid-19, and then slapping a 40% fee on the restaurants that were already financially strapped. If anything, these companies should be helping these businesses stay afloat, rahter than overcharge them."
2020-06-09 11:56:09,"I don't like to do delivery simply because if I'm being too lazy to cook, I better at least mobilize myself for a walk to pick up my food. Ever since finding out how much apps and services like Seamless, Grubhub, etc cut into restaurants' earnings, I usually just call up the restaurant myself and order on the phone.  Some places even have their own web ordering systems set up, independent of outside apps. 

There's nothing stopping you from using apps to figure out which restaurants are open, what they serve, and then calling the restaurant yourself to place your order."
2020-06-09 12:02:57,"Anyone surprised by this story could not have had a basic education in economics. If you put a middleman between a price-sensitive consumer and a low margin industry, the middle man wins, but not before taking the industry hostage."
2020-06-09 12:11:48,Please call and go to your local restaurants so they can stay in your community. We need to build community business' not hurt them with all of these money hungry so called conveniences. Be safe!!
2020-06-09 12:14:42,"Thanks for the article.  We often use Seamless to order and then pick up the food ourselves.  Do you know if the fee that the delivery service takes is reduced? By how much? What about tips? Do they all go to the restaurant, or does the service take a cut? 

I think we will start calling the restaurant directly and just pick up when possible."
2020-06-09 12:15:56,"A lot of comments here are saying not to get delivery at all, but the fact that so many people lost jobs over the past few months, meant that I think that the least I can do is to support delivery people since I myself don’t have to go out.   Delivery people make very little and rely on tips that I would like to think my fellow diners increased as much as I did during the past few months."
2020-06-09 12:19:58,"My wife and I are in our 70s and therefore at greatly elevated risk of serious illness or even death if we contract coronavirus.

We have been sitting out the pandemic in Florida, where we continue to have groceries and prescriptions delivered and avoid going out to restaurants, big box stores and other places where large number of people gather. I sanitize all food and packages that are delivered. We do get out for beach walks and socially distanced golf.

We do miss getting together with friends for dining out or social events. However, for the foreseeable future we will not be going to restaurants and certainly not other enclosed spaces like cinemas, theaters, subways, trains, airplanes or cruise ships.

Sooner or later there will be a vaccine or cure for coronavirus, and we can tough it out until that happy day arrives. 

Unfortunately for restaurateurs, we will continue to rely on delivered or curbside-pickup groceries and prepared meals."
2020-06-09 12:23:34,When I order for pickup I always search out the restaurants own website or try to call them directly. I think I'm helping them keep more of my $ than using one of the apps. But even on Yelp I find it directs me to  Grubhub when I place an order and sometimes the phone number they show directs you to one of the service apps. Spend some time to go direct to the restaurant's site!
2020-06-09 12:26:47,"Several of our local restaurants have set up their own local delivery using their excess staff. those are the restaurants my wife and I have been using during the shutdown. I used grubhub a few times before the pandemic, but a little bit of research showed that the grub hub menu had marked up prices,  in addition to the delivery fee, and in addition to the vendor fee. The food often arrived cold and late because of the multiple deliveries they were making. Calling the restaurant, placing the order and either having their folks deliver it for a fixed fee and tip or going and picking it up curbside sure beats the delivery services and is less money out of your pocket and more into the restaurants pocket"
2020-06-09 12:28:35,They charge the restaurants fees and jack up the prices for consumers. I figured it out a while ago and call the restaurants directly and tip their staff directly.
2020-06-09 12:30:05,"The point about the economics is well made. Food service in actual operating terms of preparation-to-serving does not scale up except in buffets with lots of traffic. Ultimately it is a couple of cooks, someone who packages and takes the money, one server (waiter or delivery driver) and a small party of hungry eaters. So before you had TWO gears - the restaurants’ personnel and the diners. Now you have FOUR gears in the works needing oil - restaurant workers, paying diners, App owners & driving delivery persons who are gig workers and must bear the gas, time and maintenance cost all ahead of the restaurant owners’ income. Thin margins cannot sustain a model which has burst on the seams. The reason it hit so hard without negotiation and consideration towards other alternatives in March-May is because the virus demanded a surprise and immediate shutdown. Seems other options were not as quick and readily available to most restaurants which wanted to remain operating rather than shutdown."
2020-06-09 12:31:24,"I never had a successful order make it on time with Uber Eats--tried three times.  Once they 'delivered' donuts to an alleyway behind my building.  Next time they failed to pick up ice cream order for 3 hours.  Next time the same thing happened.  Gave up.

It's pretty much a scam.

We now order online then drive by ourselves--I wish more places had their own delivery services.  But for the APPS--they can stuff it."
2020-06-09 12:32:17,"I think I am in the majority of people who (previously) visited restaurants for reasons in addition to the food. The ‘experience’ is a critical element. I recall many memorable moments in my life over the ambience of a restaurant meal, but not necessarily what I ordered."
2020-06-09 12:33:23,"Food delivery apps need to thread carefully on restaurants, because without restaurants food delivery apps are obsolete."
2020-06-09 12:34:32,A superlative job of reporting. Bravo.
2020-06-09 12:37:48,"What happened to the good old days, when restaurants hired their own delivery men and women? Pay them an hourly rate plus tips.
People can still call in their orders, or order on line and bypass the apps. 
I like a human voice with my order. 
I guess I'm living in the past. Another way, life remotely destroys businesses."
2020-06-09 12:46:49,"The restaurants should have their own delivery and charge a fee. If they use motorcycles to make deliveries, it would reduce costs.  I don’t know why the would be at the mercy of these delivery services."
2020-06-09 12:49:45,Limit Grubhub and other company charge to a maximum of 5% overnight all food delivery businesses will do great.
2020-06-09 12:55:35,"It seems that delivery has become a core function of the restaurant business, and rule number one in business is never outsource your core function. Smart restaurants will develop their own websites with online ordering and will hire their own drivers. The ones that don’t should take a hard look at the taxi cab industry if they want to see their future. Silicon Valley will eat you alive if given the chance."
2020-06-09 12:55:40,"The phenomenon is need of a follow-up story detailing the fees charged by the delivery app, and why some of the simple sounding changes that uninformed readers make about what restaurants should do, won't really work."
2020-06-09 12:56:33,"Phone the restaurant directly. It’s phone number can be found on the register receipt. Avoid calling the phone number listed on the app. The app will charge the restaurant for the call, and its a steep charge. You can always check with the restaurant to see if it provides its own delivery workers or if it relies upon a third-party service. Picking up your food will definitely save money for the restaurant. Third-party food apps are quick and convenient, but without regulation, they nickel and dime the local restaurants, and in my opinion, some of their practices are purely greedy. They know that they have the upper-hand. Thank you NYC for regulating third party apps."
2020-06-09 12:58:56,Both the restaurants and the delivery apps lose money on every order. But they make up for it in volume!!! :)
2020-06-09 13:00:00,"We always order directly from the restaurant, using the app only to read the menu.  Then we pick up from the restaurant ourselves.  We started doing that after seeing misleading statements on the app websites.  It also leaves us more money for tipping."
2020-06-09 13:00:22,"The article talks about the costs incurred by restaurants, but what about the costs incurred by the delivery services?

Remember, Uber itself is a deeply unprofitable business.

The market for food delivery, like other markets in the gig economy, has been distorted by the willingness of SoftBank and other venture capitalists to buy market share. In the meantime they’ve taught consumers that delivery is cheap. 

It isn’t cheap. With the deep subsidies withdrawn someone has to pay:  the restaurant, the delivery service, or the consumer."
2020-06-09 13:00:53,"For customers wanting to eat and help their favorite restaurants stay in business, I suggest going to pick up your order.  Not as convenient but much better for the restaurants."
2020-06-09 13:03:24,"All of this news is pretty obvious if you'd ever taken a moment to look closely at the cost of placing an order. Which is why I've never used one of these services. 

Instead, we place orders only with restaurants that have their own delivery service or offer curbside pickup. There are plenty of independent restaurants that do so. 

Successful restaurant owners have to be good business people. I'm surprised they haven't been able to figure out ways to avoid delivery apps. It's obvious the cost isn't worth the marketing or whatever other benefit the apps promise."
2020-06-09 13:05:32,Don’t these apps also make money selling all the data they collect?
2020-06-09 13:08:19,"Restaurants should add a delivery ""surcharge"" to cover the cost.  Want it delivered?  That will be $5.  Of course, consumers and the delivery companies hate this, as surcharges are very unpopular.  I used to have to pay $5 to get a pizza delivered; it is reasonable if I expect someone else to do my work of spending 25 minutes picking up food. 

This sounds like the credit card scam, where everyone is paying 3% by using a credit card but nobody realizes it.  For a long time, it was against the credit card company's user agreement to even offer a cash discount, much less add on a credit card surcharge.  

In the end, one of 3 things will happen: prices will be raised overall (to cover delivery fees and once again cover costs), restaurants may band together to get deliveries done or find someone other unique way of dealing with the situation, or they will go out of business.  I say: please fight back!  Don't let the tech world push you around."
2020-06-09 13:10:17,"I usually do my own cooking. But for special occasions, I go to the restaurant’s website, call them directly, and place my order.

Then I either drive or bike over to the restaurant, wait outside, call the desk, they bring out my order, I give a cash tip (with a gloved hand), and then feast at home!

It’s pretty easy. I never even heard of some of these apps, and I’m just as happy."
2020-06-09 13:14:00,We can thank Dr. Fauci and the gang at CDC who decided quarantining healthy people and shutting down business was the way to go. Madness by a group of bureaucrats based on models. Never before has any society quarantined an entire population of healthy people. Now Fauci and company seeing the destruction they have wrought are backing away from mass quarantining.
2020-06-09 13:16:54,"Good for you, people who smugly declare they always go pick up their food. Remember there are those out there - elderly, disabled, caring for small children - who don’t have that luxury. We need delivery when we realize we don’t have enough ingredients for dinner, nor the time or ability to go to the grocery store quickly. I just wish these services and the restaurants could find a happy middle ground."
2020-06-09 13:19:44,"My perception is that many Silicon valley innovations don't really generate new income but simply redistribute it.   Food delivery has existed forever.  What has changed is that people use cellphones for everything and companies like Grubhub have made it very simple to order food.   Arguably Uber is a bit different in that they've made it much simpler to get a ride from anywhere to anywhere compared to cabs.   The ad $ that FB receives used to go to local newspapers- same $ being spent but it's being sent to one monster company instead of many smaller ones.  

Call me a cynic, but I find the utter laziness of Americans a bit depressing.  Certainly there are super busy people or folks who need to stay indoors to stay safe who really need delivery services. But I think they're the minority.  We have the right to be lazy but I don't think as a society we're better off.  There are clear mental and physical health benefits to getting out and moving around using your own motive power- feet and bicycles work incredibly well."
2020-06-09 13:20:20,"The problem is not only with the restaurant delivery services. It also happens with grocery delivery services. I've stopped using Instacart. It is not only the company's high mark up in the prices, (the delivery fee is ok and the client tips the buyer, as in a restaurant plus whatever the company pays them), it is the suspect practice of charging for items ordered and not delivered . This is an ongoing practice (friends have had similar experience).  They with ""adjust"" the bill if you complain but many people do not take the trouble of going item by item and do not make claims. Then there are consistently errors in the bill. Unfortunately not all grocery stores have their own delivery or pick up systems. What I do not understand is why more competitors have not emerged? There are lots of unemployed people, this could be a source of work for many, a widespread gig economy.  It can even be done over the phone by smaller neighborhood grocery shops and have a group of delivery people and additional workers in the store."
2020-06-09 13:20:49,"Having walked in and out of two restaurants recently where the food preparers are wearing masks which cover their mouth and not their nose, I am now wary about ordering food by delivery where I can't verify safety precautions were followed.  

I walked out of Tal Bagel on 86th street and a doctor, a pregnant customer and two others followed right behind me as their counterman was filling orders with his nose uncovered.  It is the same as not wearing a mask and the doctor concurred with me quite loudly after I called it out. The same thing happened again at the Taco Bell on 2nd Avenue and 84th, preparer covering their mouth while leaving their nose exposed.  I asked the preparer to walk away and have someone else clean the area and then prepare my meal.  I decided to expose the restaurants as people should be aware that this is going on and be concerned about the food they are eating, especially if they can't see the food preparer in action.  I applaud these food workers for keeping the faith and working in a time of pandemic, but it is paramount to keep your customers food safe over everything else.  Restaurants better start policing themselves, or they will spell their own closures."
2020-06-09 13:23:52,"Candidly, I have no love lost for these delivery apps and deplore their tactics, but the article does a disservice.

It mentions sales rising 140 percent at these delivery services (as if they are winning at the expense of the restuarants), but fails a financial literacy test.  Sales (i.e., revenue) doesn't actually mean they're making money.  

Both Uber Eats and GrubHub lose money.  They blow a ton of money on marketing, costs and (artificially) low delivery fees.  It's a brutal cutthroat business and raises real questions about the sustainability for the business (not just for restaurants, but for consumers too)."
2020-06-09 10:49:36,"I have never used an outside delivery service. Why should they take a chunk of money from a restaurant that is doing all the work?  First, I consider walking to pick up food a part of my daily exercise routine. Second, when I do request delivery, I choose only restaurants that have their own delivery people (and tip them generously).  I always try to tip directly with cash.  If a tip is placed on the bill, one never knows how much of it actually goes to the delivery person."
2020-06-09 11:12:08,"Maybe order from restaurants close to home.  Skip the delivery services and walk, bike or drive and pick up your order.  If you give all the money to the delivery service, don't be surprised when the restaurants you like are gone.  This is NOT rocket science.  Poor Americans, can't cook at home or wear a mask in public.  Sad."
2020-06-09 11:17:13,I have been hearing about the excessive charges more and more. I pick up my take out orders. I don't use on line ordering vehicles unless the restaurant offers no option. I ask when picking up my take out what the restaurant prefers when I order. Don't use them unless you absolutely have to. Same advice for the restaurant owners - find another solution if the alternative is to lose money on every order.
2020-06-09 11:43:10,"Delivery is expensive; it doesn't scale very well. Renting a good location with enough tables is also expensive. The delivery model probably works if you substitute rent and front-of-house labor for the delivery charges; the battle is really online vs brick-&-mortar. It's not going to work very well for businesses that have both the high overheads of a retail business and the expensive cost of direct delivery. Maybe if your kitchen has enough spare capacity to cope with a full house,  it can make extra meals for delivery, with the marginal profit of the delivered meals going straight to the bottom line, but you can't escape the fact that if you are paying for tables in a good location, you have to fill those tables. The effect will be that 'dark kitchens' in cheap locations with no front of house will make the most money from delivery. So if there is ongoing demand for delivered food, it most likely will cause a different type of food business to evolve."
2020-06-09 13:25:52,"These delivery companies such as Grubhub are expensive to both the restaurants and the customers.  Uber Eats is the worse they don't bring the orders to your apartment, they expect you to walk out to their car, if I wanted to walk out into the street I would just go to the restaurant myself.  Grubhub and Doordash service varies.  I am over these services, not worth it.  Restaurants really should drop their participation.  It is much better to go out and pick up the food yourself, better for the restaurant and better for yourself both financially and having one less set of hands on your food."
2020-06-09 13:29:48,"We avoid using the apps to order pick up food.  Several of the restaurants that we frequent in our area were using the apps at the beginning but have dropped them due to the fees.  Though we like the ease of ordering on line (no busy signals either), we much rather leave out the middleman and call the restaurant directly.  Most restaurants in the area will bring the order out to your car, thus no contact."
2020-06-09 13:35:53,"I’ll offer a slight variation on this. I work for a store that provides wine, liquor and beer through one of the major delivery services not mentioned in this article. We mark our regular retail (shelf) prices up a hefty percent and then the delivery company tacks on their percentage. The accounting is difficult but we make money and consider it well worthwhile. If the average restaurant is indeed operating on a 10% margin then they likewise need to be marking up their menu prices, say, 20%. If the failing restaurants are not doing this then of course they’re going to be losing money on food deliveries!"
2020-06-09 13:36:08,that's why i leave a tip to more than cover the cost of a transaction.  better yet i'll call and ask if they'll simply take order over phone or just pay on arrival.  it's perfectly safe to walk into a restaurant and pay.  we are over roatating on being afraid of entering a building for 5-10 minutes.  especially if there are only a few people present.

The problem with Pierogis in general is that when you finish all the pierogis on your plate, you feel like you are just getting started!!!

I try my best to order directly from restaurants and pick food up myself.  Food less likely to arrive cold, and it costs me less. I am surprised the fees to the restaurant for Grubhub etc are so high (although I believe the reporter), since it seems like they are charging me plenty, too."
2020-06-09 13:40:05,"I wish restaurants would do a better job of educating their customers about how to order for take out or delivery.  There is absolutely no reason to order take out through any website other than the restaurant's website.  It is ridiculous to give Grubhub or Doordash 5 or 10$ for doing nothing more than processing the order.  With take out here to stay for the foreseeable future, it would be great if restaurants joined together in a city and formed their own delivery/take out service."
2020-06-09 13:40:20,"I spent my career as a chef so I am very familiar with the razor thin profit margins restaurants operate under even in “normal” times.

I know it’s not practical for all restaurants, but couldn’t many simply hire their own drivers, set up phone and online ordering options and eliminate GrubHub and Ubereats? Then the restaurants are simply paying an employee or two instead of being extorted."
2020-06-09 13:44:41,"I have been trying to order directly from the restaurant, but it has been hit or miss. Some restaurants want you to give them your credit card number up front. Some restaurants offer promotions that are only available if you order online.

It's new to the restaurants and with lower margins than hotels I'm sure it's a burden. These companies need to work in better faith with their suppliers or when things pick up again they won't have any but the bottom of the barrel for delivery options. After seeing what OTAs (online travel agencies) did to hotel average rates, I'd recommend being very, very careful when stepping into this fairly new industry of app food delivery."
2020-06-09 14:31:21,"Online food delivery works very well in India. Couple of home grown unicorns ie start ups worth a billion dollars along with Uber eats mean that there is enough competition and commissions charged to restaurants aren't prohibitive. They have helped many small delivery only eateries to survive.

Surprised to learn that phenomenon, which is supposed to level out the playing field, is creating monopolistic practices in the states. Wonder how the commissions are so high? What is the fair practice watchdog doing?

Smaller eateries can cut costs by doing away with dine in altogether and invest in multiple kitchens to serve several areas in a big city. The former needs prime real estate and big footfalls to make money and patrons are not rushing to restaurants in a hurry given the current scenario.

The smaller eateries need to lobby the government to bring the delivery startups to the negotiating table. Joints doing take aways and outfits specializing in delivery form a complementary relationship which can work well for both. It's symbiotic, so it's important to weed out the predatory practices"

Tipping is in cash at 15 percent of the total cost. Every time.

Post-pandemic, this practice will resume — during the lockdown, I cook every meal at home to help flatten the curve.

I have decided that this was a gimmick business at first that has turned into basically price gouging not only to the restaurant business, but really also to the consumer. 

It is the last time I will use these delivery services. If they continue to be antagonistic toward the restaurant businesses I think they will find themselves losing a lot more than profit. I have one really nice restaurant in walking distance. I patronized them a lot while we were in a ""normal"" mode in the US. I have ordered take out from then a few times but I am going to make an effort to get my own car and drive to pick up. It's less expensive and takes out that ugly middle man.

2020-06-09 14:58:27,"Obviously people do not understand these apps business model.

Let me explain. They are all losing money hand over fist, will continue to lose and we are not talking about small amounts. Doordash, for example, lost $500 million last year. Uber has already lost billions.

As long as investors keep on sinking money into these so-called ""logistic"" companies, without holding them to account for how they are using these funds, then you can even call this a ponzi scheme of sorts.

Not a single one of these apps have yet to come up with a system that fully takes into account real world costs across the board and this includes their own operational costs.

The eateries are paying high fees because part and sometimes all of that money is being used to subsidize the one who is making the delivery. 

Those customers who complain about high fees; you must be kidding! The fees you are paying are frequently not proportionate to how far away you are from that eatery and how much it actually costs to deliver to you. In point of fact, they are so low that there are times that deliveries are made at a loss because they exceed both the eatery fee and the fee you are paying for that delivery.

It is a race to the bottom.

Worst of all, these apps are notoriously inefficient and definitively adds to the costs of those who are making the actual deliveries.

I have no idea why these investors keep on sinking funds into these losing ventures."

I would appreciate if delivery services were more straightforward about the true cost of delivery. I wouldn't mind paying marginally more for the food if restaurants need to cover additional costs. I also wonder if the model for restaurant businesses is just broken. I mean, how long have they got away with lowballing tipped waitstaff so that customers see a 'low' price on their menu and consequently have to pay more in tips? Just charge the real cost of preparing food already and stop trying to lure people with artificially low prices!"
2020-06-09 16:13:25,Small restaurants where I live hired delivery drivers who worked for tips and a $5 delivery charge.
2020-06-09 16:18:26,"The delivery services, and particularly GrubHub/Seamless (GHS), charge outrageous fees.  In fact, I have been boycotting GHS because they are the only service that has challenged a new planned NYC law that would require such services to lower their fees during the crisis, so give food services a break.

It may actually be more cost effective for restaurants, etc. that have not done so yet to hire on their own delivery people, than to continue to pay fees that are only going to go up."
2020-06-09 16:20:12,"The question is do these apps increase the profitabily of restaurants by generating more revenue, or are they ultimately just another middle-man cost?"
2020-06-09 16:21:54,I have my own doubts about the quality and safety of foods which people get through delivery apps.
2020-06-09 16:32:47,"Obviously non of these restaurant owners ever heard of lean manufacturing. Imagine if all you had to pay for was a kitchen? No dinning area or wait staff, just a kitchen. Everything goes out the door. Less is more."
2020-06-09 16:37:28,"When I order from Doordash, I pay almost double what I would if I went to the restaurant and picked up the order myself. The prices for the food are higher, there is a Doordash service fee as well, and then of course there is the tip (which I gladly pay).

Many restaurants are simply passing extra costs onto the customer. As a customer I can choose to pay those costs or not. This model should work for everyone. Hopefully as delivery apps get more marketshare, this is the way Doordash and the like will make their money. 

I want fees to be displayed upfront to all."
2020-06-09 16:41:22,I think the practice of taking part of a restaurant’s profits is outrageous and I’m seriously rethinking my use of Doordash.  I had no idea such delivery companies were hitting up restaurants in addition to my paying a monthly fee plus generous tips.  Their greed endangers the very existence of our local restaurants.

2020-06-09 15:59:17,"The worst news for restaurants is that for the foreseeable future, the dining in experience is ruined. I went out to a local restaurant that I know that opened under social distancing guidelines. Wearing masks unless you’re eating; scanning a QR code to look at the menu on my cell phone screen; having to enter all my credit card information into my phone to pay my bill (one digit at a time) because the restaurant chose a merchant POS service that doesn’t work with Apple Pay— and then the server made mistakes, and there was a very loud person at a table nearby. Afterwards, I told my wife I’d rather do takeout or delivery from that restaurant and eat at home."
2020-06-09 11:57:13,"The delivery companies long term goal is not to serve restaurants. It is to collect enough data until they know who orders what where, how often etc, etc. Then they will flood the city with ghost kitchens, and direct all requests to their sites. It is the exact same business model that Amazon did by replacing the hundred most sold items with their own brands.
There is not one delivery company that gives the restaurants access to the user-data, exactly for that reason. 
Travis Kalanick, who was with Uber, is getting into this game with over 400 million dollars in backing so far besides his own 300 million dollar investment. 
Does anybody truly think delivery companies are interested in restaurants, who's profit margins are mostly in the single digits? Also, delivery was for most restaurants simply a desperate attempt to have ANY money come in at all during Covid-19, nothing more.
Also important to know for consumers is, the average price for meals via delivery is about 30% higher than eating it in the restaurants. For details look at this excellent report at Tech Crunch.

I hate the “good old days” refrain - but it was much better prior when you called the local restaurant, they took your order, “your guy” delivered it and you tipped him for HIS/HER service. If it was prepared incorrectly, they brought a replacement.

Now, it’s takes too much time to get any accountability for any wrongly prepared order. It’s not worth what they are charging for little to no service."

My area here in Greenpoint is one of the epicenters of it.

Don't get me wrong, companies from Amazon to GrubHub are legit in theory. I would never use them because I like to walk, visits stores and am not too computer savvy. 

However where the hipsters are wrong are patronizing sites like mentioned that are usurious re their fees to retail establishments.

If hipsters want a cause to fight for, fight for this cause, ie making these delivery services drastically lower their fees.

Where are you hipsters on this?"
2020-06-09 16:33:35,A great article. THANK YOU for showing these app companies hypocrisy in name of helping small restaurants only to take a huge amount in fees. I own two restaurants and these fees are killing us. It is a hostage situation as we need a delivery service to survive and stay open until the business becomes normal.

2020-06-09 16:52:55,"I think it’s absurd to take this much out of a restaurant’s pocket.  The conundrum is two fold, many restaurants, once they sign up with a delivery service,  they can’t take orders over the phone.   And Yet, if they can take phone orders and maintain that relationship do they have enough business to maintain a staff of deliverers.   I’m taking the advice of others and ordering direct."
2020-06-09 16:55:52,"I had never gotten delivery (or much takeout) prior to the pandemic. I started using Grub Hub, to support the driver in addition to the restaurant.  A local TV station had a piece where restaurant owners talked about how much Grub Hub takes, and says that if you go to the restaurant's site and order from there, the fees the restaurant pays Grub Hub are less. (Can any restaurant folks confirm how much of a difference it is?). So I do that now, or just pick up my order."
2020-06-09 16:58:55,"Unfortunately, it will come down to a choice.

Keep staff, or keep the delivery service.

This being the new normal, delivery will be so much more prevalent than dinning in, if that ever comes back.

Based on that, you need a delivery service a lot more than waiters and the like.

You can choose between using such a service, or keeping personnel. At the end of the day, it will be a simple problem, to pay X you have to cut down on expenses ... and waitresses are no longer needed as no one is eating in ... so that's where you can cut from. 

Restaurants will cut enough folks out of payroll to fit in the fees, and balance will be restored.

All is good, except of course, all the out of work liberal arts students formerly known as waiters and waitresses.

It all comes down to money. In this current scene, the waitresses will loose out."
2020-06-09 17:03:50,"I can see most restaurants just having their own delivery people. Grubhub is a scam and restaurant owners know it. Restaurants could  have delivery only business plans as their model. Imagine, just a kitchen and delivery vehicles. No more 39K rent on a big dining room and customer bathrooms. Menus online with pretty pictures and instant reviews. I would think owners would like the idea of making great food without the hassle of dealing with customers directly. No more expensive liquor licenses. laundry service bills, expensive plates and glasses and flatware.  Profit margins would go up like rockets if a restaurant didn't have to provide a ""dining experience"" and just served great food."
2020-06-09 17:13:23,I understand the convenience of using one app to order any cuisine but these apps are killing the businesses that they're designed to connect people to. Why not just pick up the phone and call the restaurant to place an order or bookmark the websites of your favorite restaurants?
2020-06-09 17:16:39,"This model works for restaurants only when the delivery orders represent an incremental portion of their business.  Once delivery becomes the predominant source of revenue, it's a disaster.  It doesn't take an MBA to figure that out.  The delivery is the gravy and the in person dining is the main course of a restaurant's business.  Nobody anticipated it flipping (not the restauranteurs or the delivery apps).  Now that it has, the only solution is for the apps to significantly cut their fees to allow the restaurants to survive.  If not, the restaurants will all go out of business.  It's just not sustainable."
2020-06-09 17:17:15,"Great article ! I have never used one of these delivery companies or any delivery services before or during the lock down and after this article, all the more reason I will not be using them. In areas that do not have curfew or complete lock-downs, it would help these businesses if people could do a curbside or drive-through pick up. That way these restaurants get to keep 100% of what little they are making during these difficult times. Cooked food being delivered to your doorstep if you are able-bodied human being just does not make sense to me."
2020-06-09 17:19:33,"When we order take out, my husband always picks it up. We want to makes sure our money is going the restaurant, not to a delivery service. My husband worked for a food delivery service and knows first-hand how they effect restaurant income.

Honestly, I prefer to eat inside the restaurant. Eating outdoors has never appealed to me; even al fresco dining invites too many insects and exposure to dirt and pollution. Once we are in a safer place with COVID, I look forward to eating in a restaurant again. We're not there yet."
2020-06-09 17:20:46,"If these restaurants don't like the fees the delivery services are charging, perhaps they should stop using them.

If they then say that there are no better alternatives because people want their food delivered and that the big delivery services companies dominate the sector, that seems to me like an opportunity for either those restaurants or someone in to step in, charge lower fees, and undercut the big players.

Or better yet, as some of the restaurants in the story are doing, take delivery orders over the phone or via their own website."
2020-06-09 17:21:25,"I've never used any of those services and can't imagine I ever would, to me ordering from restaurants I appreciate and then picking up the orders is a way to cut both of our costs and cut out a service I don't need.  I understand they may be helpful in certain cities, but after reading this, I would still just go pick up the food myself or use their in house delivery service."
2020-06-09 17:25:35,"once i found out about these fees, and it was pre covid, i've vowed to pick up my own takeout.  i'll never use one again."
2020-06-09 17:31:13,"I order from restaurants because I was well aware of the fees. However, this was not always the case. 5 years ago, I moved from NY to SF, the birthplace of most of these delivery apps. In NY, delivery was cheap because of subways, biking, etc but in SF, cars, scooter rentals and parking were required so fees skyrocket. I stopped ordering delivery and cooked more at home. 

When I do pick up delivery (which is usually 2-3 times a week during COVID), I support my local restaurants by ordering ahead and picking it up on one of my neighborhood walks. Many of my neighbors are doing the same - they're out with their kids, walking around, getting some fresh air and supporting our local businesses. I am a huge foodie and want to support restaurants, not app delivery companies that don't even treat their contract gig workers well. 

We have become so convenience based, we haven't really looked outside our own 4 walls to see the restaurants that are within a few square miles. The other day, the restaurant made an error with my order (my meal is a dish I can't eat), and the owner drove my order to me since I had a work call and could not walk back, handed me 2 free iced teas, and apologized. You can't get that customer service from app companies. While I wait for my food, I sometimes have a beer outside. Everyone is wearing masks, respectful of space, and happy to see other humans walking around. 

Sadly, I don't think many people have done this but they may be happier if they did."

2020-06-09 17:40:01,"One aspect of this discussion thread that puzzles me, is why anyone would tip a sandwich assembler in Subway or a coffee preparer in Starbucks for doing the same type of job as a checkout cashier in WalMart, or a gas station clerk. I suppose it's just the food and beverage equivalent of hotel resort fees. If you can get away with it, why not give it a try?

Once, when I was in a very fancy part of California we ordered take-out pizza by phone, then went to collect it. Not only did this take-out only place have a tip jar on the counter, but they had already pre-charged 10% tip on the invoice, with a space below for ""Additional Gratuity"". For carry-out - really?"
2020-06-09 17:48:58,"There should be no fee to restaurants, let the customer pay the full freight for using the delivery service.  

Worse yet, these companies are scraping the non participating restaurants’ online menus and setting up different phone numbers that go thru call centers, so that patrons who think they are calling the restaurant directly are actually going thru these outfits, which take their cut before the hapless restaurant knows what hit them. The rest. fills the order, a delivery guy shows up, one who may or may not look like a regular customer.  It’s only when the business is reconciling their books that they realize some of that these outfits hijacked their customers. Getting a refund is difficult. Outrageous.

Use a phone book or grab the restaurant menu in person so you can be sure of patronizing the business directly.

Wash Post had an article a week or so ago that detailed the shady practices."
2020-06-09 17:52:48,"I've long felt that companies like Seamless are not in this business to support restaurants, but simply to take their (very massive) cut of the profit and run. They are reaping huge profits while grossly underpaying the delivery workers who are doing the actual WORK. While most restaurants will need more than just takeout orders to survive long-term, it's the least you can do to pick up the phone and call your local restaurants to order. Cut out these profit-seeking companies. If it's safe for you to leave your home, opt for takeout instead of delivery."
2020-06-09 17:56:42,"Welcome to the 21st century economy! A money-losing business (delivery service) is gouging a barely profitable business (restaurants). The money-losing business doesn't have employees; they have ""contractors"", gig workers who work for minimum wage (or close to it) and whose survival depends on tips. While restaurants have employees, they too are paid minimum wage (or below minimum wage) and their survival depends on tips. 

The delivery companies have billions of dollars in backing from venture capital funds, but the small restaurants have no such backing beyond the credit line they have with their banks. This imbalance is responsible for the current situation; the deliver companies can create monopolies, create fake websites, and expand rapidly into different markets because they have seemingly unlimited capital. if the delivery companies were forced to survive without VC backing, they would either quickly die out or adopt business models that were more sustainable and created a win-win situation with the restaurants."
2020-06-09 18:05:26,"Can the restaurants set the prices differently for purchases via food apps so that they cover the cost of actually preparing the food?

The food service industry is being destroyed by the pandemic, no question. Adapting will take enormous creativity and perseverance. I'm happy to stay at home and cook. But, I feel bad for the folks whose businesses are being decimated. I simply won't eat out with people I don't know. Maybe in the future, testing can be done at the door with entry requiring a negative PCR test. Seems like a huge hassle...but..some will do it. The dining experience has been turned on his head for sure."

2020-06-09 18:10:45,"While there were issues with third party delivery services before the pandemic, it really is the closure of on-site dining that crashes the business model.  When restaurants are in full operation, delivery orders are a supplement to dine-in revenue, not the sole source of revenue.  If your tables are full, the MARGINAL cost of a delivery order is not 90 percent of the revenue; it's a lot less. In that situation, a third party service makes sense.  It saves restaurateurs the cost and hassle of hiring delivery drivers (or diverting staff to take orders and make deliveries), buying or leasing a delivery vehicle, paying insurance for drivers, etc.  And, delivery is intended in part as a generator of sit-down business.  You want the person who orders delivery while working late on Thursday to become a sit-down customer with her family on Saturday.  But if the dining room is closed, that opportunity is gone."

Why is it not viable to hire young drivers willing to use their own vehicles, or even purchase a cheap company car, maybe even outfitting it with a Yeti to keep food warm while delivering?

Especially when so many people are ordering delivery services, it seems sensible to manage your own delivery and turn those outrageous 3rd party fees into in-house delivery revenue. What am I missing here?"
2020-06-09 18:23:36,I never use a delivery service. I call the restaurant and pickup my order or use the restaurant's delivery service not one of these services. These delivery services are greedy.

Hire former waitstaff as delivery people and they can use their own car or provide a bike/scooter for delivery in dense urban areas.  ""We can't afford to do that"" is a copout because the restaurants were paying the highway robbery fees required by Grubhub, Uber Eats and other delivery services."
2020-06-09 18:31:39,"Restaurant economics seem similar to most industries; outsize return to sales and space.

Fundamental restructuring is required in most industries.  The apps are no different than sales teams at other companies where they receive disproportionate percent of value for executing on final step of a long process.

Also, many restaurants in NYC, at least, fail because of outrageous rent costs.  For some reason we are comfortable with that as a free market transaction but not with the apps?

I want restaurants to survive and think apps need to be regulated but let’s also look at landlords too.

And the outrage over the “leverage” of sales organization (which is what these apps essentially are) should extend beyond restaurants.  Ask any customer service rep why a sales person makes 10x for essentially closing the same sale 1,000 other people could and delivering little incremental value than a replacement."

Some businesses would offer cash discounts on restaurant meals or assume eveyone would pay with a credit card and add the credit card fee.
Could be worth a shot to add the delivery fee to the check with a note offering a lower price for in restaurant lick up.

2020-06-09 19:01:57,"The obvious solution is more competition with more providers of  delivery services.   If the business is so profitable, others will want to enter.

2020-06-09 18:56:49,"Restaurateurs should boycott the delivery apps and just take delivery orders over the phone. Or they could get together and make their own app which would not soak their customers. Grubhub and seamless and the others are leeches sucking money from restaurants, workers, and consumers."
2020-06-09 16:57:45,"These delivery companies are parasites. They are sucking the blood out of restaurants at the same time that they are pretending to offer a service to customers.
It's quite a clever business model. The customer is enticed by the low (or zero, even) delivery fee. However, the inevitable result is that restaurants will either have to increase their prices, or reduce the quality / quantity of their offerings.
I would have thought an obvious solution is for local restaurants to forget that they are competitors and band together to open their own app systems, free of massive charges."
2020-06-09 18:05:54,I will never use these so called services.  They are looters.

2020-06-09 17:16:10,"When did we get so lazy? People please stop using these apps! Can the restaurant directly on their phone - not the app switchboard - and if the restaurant does not have delivery of its own, go pick up the food yourself. If you do not look after your local businesses, they cannot look after you. What is so hard about this?"
2020-06-09 17:40:23,"Thank you for revealing the practices of these so-called ""food delivery"" apps. This should arouse public outrage!

If you can pick up your own food or just walk to another restaurant that is not being ripped off by these vulture delivery services.

Just like Amazon, you get delivery tomorrow and the mom and pop shops are out of business and Amazon is ripping third party vendors off they don't  break even.

2020-06-09 17:05:44,"I knew the GrubHib commercials about saving restaurants was a lie.
I call my local restaurants on the phone.  It’s nice to talk to someone.  The I either go pick up or a member of their own staff delivers.  It takes less time than going through the online process and saves everyone money.  The only reason restaurants feel the need a third party delivery service is that brainwashed consumers have come to believe they have to do everything online."

I run a marketing company and I always advise my clients to spend money on their own website AND delivery app. If you're making local deliveries there's no reason to let apps take your money. Not worth it in the long run.

You would think that delivery companies would lower their prices as volume expands but clearly that's not the case. They could have harvested customers for the long run but they're killing their own business model by overcharging restaurants during the pandemic."

Mostly, I cook my own food and make enough for left-overs."
2020-06-09 20:02:37,The apps are so costly that I find them to be cost prohibitive. I am also afraid of just adding additional chances of transmission of the virus.
2020-06-09 20:05:03,"Pizza restaurants have been running their own delivery services for decades. 

Fifty years ago, all that was required to set up a pizza delivery service was a landline and a student with a driver's licence and access to his parent's car.

If delivery is going to be essential to running a restaurant, owners have to adapt and stop outsourcing delivery. Restaurants don't hire janitorial services to mop the kitchen floor, so why are they relying on delivery apps?"
2020-06-09 20:06:58,"There is an answer.  In Austin we have a local ride app similar to Uber et.al. that is a not for profit and gives a significantly higher percentage to the driver, keeping only a set booking fee.  Every driver I have ever queried here as to their preference names the local app as their favorite even though most work through all of the regulars, too. So, in a larger area, why not a similar cooperative app and delivery system . This system, while still with its costs, would eliminate the rather large portion that GrubHub and others take.   Restaurants or other local companies would kick in some seed money to get started. That could even be considered a loan to be repaid.  Here in Austin we have Favor, though a private company, did eliminate fees to the the restaurant.  As for me, I go and pickup.  I never click through a link to the restaurant as these often are done, albeit hidden, through an external service. Rather,  I I go directly to the restaurant's website or call the restaurant directly by phone if possible.  I also tip 20% or more."
2020-06-09 20:11:24,"I don’t understand why the delivery services don’t charge the people who order instead of the restaurant. A truer measure of cost, no?"
2020-06-09 20:11:26,"If the cost of using a delivery service is so onerous (and I don't doubt it is), and given that delivery seems to be the model of the future, perhaps it's time we took a step back to simpler times (you know, those halcyon days of 2017?) when many restaurants handled their own deliveries. 

I'm sure there is some software engineer out there who could make a bundle developing an app for individual restaurants to use and, even with a nominal delivery fee, improve their bottom line while saving the customer from the app-based services' usurious service/delivery charges. 

In-house delivery would also strengthen the customer/restaurant relationship since your food would be delivered by a restaurant employee, who has a stake in the business staying viable, not some random gig worker who just wants to get on to his/her next delivery."
2020-06-09 20:23:27,Delivery apps are too expensive.  I can’t wait for restaurants to open so I can call them direct and save on fees!
2020-06-09 20:25:57,"Restaurants have been complaining about these third-party delivery services for years and years but they rarely offer their own delivery.

2020-06-09 20:36:04,"As a consumer, I expect all the complexities of Restaurant Business rolled into the Pricing of food. Let me then make a decision if I want to go to a restaurant or not. Restaurants should start focusing on Good Service for them to stay relevant. They should never make a customer feel obligated to pay a Tip. Lot of times I avoid restaurants because I don't like tipping."
2020-06-09 20:48:59,"As I understand it, outfits like Ocean-Spray and Land O Lacks are farmers cooperative owned by the farmers for the purpose of getting their good to market. 

Couldn’t restaurants for the same here. They are using GrubHub to do the same thing -get their goods to the market. Some sort of coop delivery/ordering service owned by the restaurateurs."
2020-06-09 20:56:12,"Small retailer here:  My advice to restaurants: just don't do it.  Selling a lot of stuff at a loss is much, much worse than selling a small amount of stuff at a profit.  You're not a dot-com that's going get purchased based on sales, alone.  You're not.  You need to make a profit and pay bills.  Do what it takes to make a profit.  Sales are irrelevant if you're selling at a loss.

Heck, my retail business was approached by Amazon to be one of their first ""partners"" in our product category about 15-ish years ago.  They wanted 30% of our sales price (including shipping).  We work on a 25% gross margin, and don't mark up shipping at all.  I told them in no uncertain terms that I wasn't willing to bankrupt myself just to sell more stuff.  That didn't make any sense.  15-ish years later, that was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  We're still going strong (and still profitable)."
2020-06-09 20:57:27,"I don't get it. Before the pandemic restaurants were fine with the apps fees but after the pandemic restaurants were really hurting, and for the record we all feel terribly for their loss of income. But they can't blame their woes on the delivery apps, they need to blame the virus."
2020-06-09 20:58:49,"This is very simple: call the restaurant directly. Period. Sure, middlemen can be useful, but if you're trying to save your local businesses? Deal with them directly. If you don't want to go out and they have their own delivery people, terrific. If not, either try to go out and pick it up yourself (most places make it very easy now) or see if you can ask a friend."
2020-06-09 21:08:09,"My wife and I are retirees.  We don't use food delivery services.  Why bother?  There are a dozen or more restaurants plus a couple of supermarkets with good takeout food all within two miles of our home .  That is more than enough for us. 
If nothing else, picking up our own food is a way to get out of the house, and that is no small thing when in these times. Of course we would prefer traditional restaurant service, but we are doing what we can for our own sanity and the fiscal health of small businesses.
I am skeptical of gig economy services generally.  Most seem to be close to scams, taking advantage of people who are desperate for work and who do not have a clear idea of what driving around for hours every day really costs. 
Sure, we have used ride hailing services like Lyft and Uber, largely because most traditional cab companies have refused to modernize their hailing systems."
2020-06-09 21:17:51,I'd order from a restaurant directly if they offer delivery. If they choose to not offer one then the apps are going to get the business.

Our family regularly orders through Doordash; however, after reading this piece, I will no longer be using the app.  I'd rather take the time to drive myself to a restaurant for a pick-up order than be the cause of unnecessary debt.

Here is my question: What happens to the fees the customer pays directly to Doordash?  I was under the impression that those fees went directly to the restaurant, but now it seems these fees are lining the pockets of Doordash executives along with the exorbitant fees these small business owners have to cough up.  

Like almost every other industry in this country of capitalist greed, the ""gig"" execs seem to be making the big bucks while the delivery drivers and owners of these small businesses take the chump change."
2020-06-09 21:30:56,"Is it really so hard to call a restaurant directly? Or for a restaurant to put up a website for direct ordering? If it is so hard, then those delivery apps earn their money and are well worth it. But I don't think so."

Now we pick it up and get a better pizza cheaper and faster. If charges are punitive, restaurants should stop accepting them. They can do their own deliveries. I don't know why companies now believe they have to farm out all their labor to a middleman and pay through the nose for it.

Amazon and Big Tech pioneered instant gratification catalogues that devour or exploit small businesses and by extension, communities. Posing as convenience these compiler apps erode user agency, especially decision-making and critical thinking. It's tragic that restaurants so essential to the public sphere are starved both by an indifferent government and by private enterprise. (Some are about to go public.)
The kind of predation that passes for entrepreneurship these days is revolting. I pray there's a way to undercut these parasites at a local level, maybe through cooperatives or trade associations that take a fair cut and pay workers a living wage. Solutions are possible - if they start at the local level and gain support at the state level and national level."
2020-06-09 20:15:09,"No one is holding a gun to the restaurant owners' heads. They don't have to use the apps if they don't think it's worth it. If they have a better alternative, then by all means - but mumbling and grumbling about fees isn't going to move the needle."
2020-06-09 20:27:20,It’s simple: If you want restaurants to survive just go pick up your food. Takes 5-10 minutes and gets you out of your house/home office/newly glass walled  cubicle box/former open floor plan/no longer open floor plan space. You are not too busy to do it. In fact I bet you will come up with more creative ideas if you get up and move around than if you just sit in front of your computer coding and/or pretending to be busy for your boss. The delivery economy adds no value to society but you can - by supporting businesses that actually create something.

Postamtes crooks failed to explain honestly how their fees are calculated and failed account for the almost doubling of the bill.
In an exchange of dozens of emails, they kept repeating that their fees are a variable percentage and never showed what is the variability. They also charge service fees which they never indicated that it is their service fee. And apparently delivery is separate from their service. What a bunch of crooks?"

Then I quit Grubhub, but it took a while for me to figure out how to do it online--they don't make it easy. The next time I tried ordering through the website, trying to dodge Grubhub, I was given a choice of two other services to order through, with no option for direct ordering.

2020-06-10 07:46:42,"I feel blessed to live in the western half of San Francisco, where most of the places I order from have their own websites.  All of the money I pay--food, drinks, tips--goes directly to the restaurant and its employees.  Those that do not have a website I can call directly.  My wife and I already have a relationship with them and they already have our address and credit card information.  

I learned never to order through one of the delivery apps after retiring and taking a part-time job as a cook (cooking has long been an avocation of mine).  The apps jacked up the price of our food by up to 50% and then charged us a delivery fee.  Not exactly a ""recipe"" for fostering customer loyalty and goodwill.  To add insult to injury, their drivers would show up 5 minutes after accepting the order, aggressively waving their phones in our faces, even though we scheduled pick-up for 20-30 minutes later.

I would urge all your readers to patronize those establishments with their own website or where they can call in and pick up their own orders.  GrubHub, UberEats, DoorDash are not your friends.  And they are certainly not helping keep your favorite restaurants alive."

This infuriating NYT article wraps up with a ribbon everything that my many valued restaurant industry entrepreneur friends have been saying is been going on and how they are hurt by Uber, with Uber and its ilk making massive profits on the backs of small entrepreneurs.

These are shameful business practices, certainly equal to war profiteering, and I would hope law enforcement acts.
My part as a consumer is to tell as many people I know, and ensure that especially after the Coronapocalypse passes what an unethical business that Uber is. In the long game of business I know this will come back to haunt you and Uber.

The lipservice to good works, as in Chicago, says everything about your company. 
In times of serious trouble, you are especially judged by your actions, not your words.
Shame on you for making this happen, and I can only imagine what you tell your children and family about ethics and morality.

PS: Thanks for also cancelling our local Sobi BikeShare in the middle of this. Just one more moral indicator.

And sorry there is no way to contact you or anyone at Uber ! Nice !"

Have not been in months and will not go into a movie theater until the pandemic is over. It is not over. As states reopen, we are seeing consistent spikes in new cases in our county. We've broken our own records in the past ten days: first spike, 55 cases; second, 64; third, 88: fourth, 118; yesterday's, 161. The last three days have brought more new cases than we saw during the shutdown. The virus is not going away just because businesspeople and politicians want it to. It's clear that Republicans have decided that culling the herd is their strategy for battling the coronavirus, and they have made us the guinea pigs in their uncontrolled experiment. No thank you."
2020-06-10 14:55:40,"If America wanted the economy to improve, America's leader would put on a face mask, thereby modeling the #1 easiest way to reduce the coronavirus contagion curve and signal to tens of millions of Americans that face masks matter.

Instead, we get Presidential ignorance, rejection of common sense, basic science and a complete lack of personal, social and economic responsibility of the first order.

The President is not only wrecking the economy with his maskless performance act, he's also adding to the nation's death totals.

Decent Americans should call for his removal from office."
2020-06-10 15:07:54,"These are separate problems happening at the same time, and reinforcing each other.

Protectionism is a response to longer term problems of security of sources, and of economic equity at home.

Covid-19 is unrelated, but has many side effects like sudden realization that critical medical supplies need to be available in the home economy.

Recession is unrelated to trade issues, and is a secondary effect of Covid-19 closures, as we shut down our economies on purpose, hoping that is temporary and just as quickly reversible.

We often have more than one problem at a time, but they don't often all have strong side effects, all trending in the same direction. It is the convergence that is so very dangerous here."
2020-06-10 15:33:42,"Out of WW2 came war technology innovations that were later applied to civilian life.  Propulsion devices and the airline industry, ship building technology, medicine and medical practices, etc.  The pause in 'everyday life' for five years of complete focus on a common virus, was followed by a resurgence of 'everyday life' much refined and accelerated.  This pause in 'everyday life' due to Covid-19 should be seen as a similar opportunity.  New industries can be developed:  testing and tracing using existing and yet to be developed methods made infrastructure now will smooth out future viruses.  Waste and dysfunction is being surfaced in ways of much higher profiles than in times of more negligence.  It is when one cannot afford the luxury of waste that the most effective fine tuning takes place.  To speak of restarting a dysfunctional and unequal world are the words of a punter.  Unfortunately, Trump is a short sighted, punter, who preaches to the short sighted simple minded.  Perhaps with Biden, long term solutions and adjustments will be seen as options."
2020-06-10 16:10:45,"The investor class has had their own “smash and grab” by using money pumped in to prop up the economy. The rich will take their profits, and then run home while taxpayers foot the bill for all that Fed infusion and deficit spending by the GOP. And the market crashes.

Then, as they retreat in their million-dollar homes, they’ll sit in condescending judgment of looters from poor neighborhoods who don’t get trillions from the Fed for their smash and grab behavior.

2020-06-10 16:15:58,"So Trump wants to give tons of money to big corporations, who will pocket much of it and give it to those already wealthy.  Working people will end up with crumbs, or nothing at all.

The sensible thing is to give that amount of money directly to the people for them to spend, and the companies that they spend it on will benefit.  The people benefit, and the companies benefit, but it is the market that decides which companies, not Donald J. Trump."

2020-06-10 16:30:25,"So Mnuchin says more stimulus is needed. Fine I’ll agree with that. The more fo that stimulus that reaches people’s pockets directly the better. 

Next breath Mnuchin claims that the 2nd half of the year will look good. Still looking forward to that V-shaped recession I see. I don’t buy that.

Without providing too much identifying information allow me to suggest, based on my current experience, and my view on what orders in the business that employs me look like, that Mnuchin is totally full of it. 

When the economy is humming along, and people are buying goods like cars, washing machines, home improvements or new home builds, our business flourishes. In fact, it flourishes ahead of when that activity is fully on display - because what we make goes into those goods. (Think the classic BASF ad). So, for a flourishing 2nd half of the year I should already be seeing upticks in orders so the goods going into those applications can be built-out.

But, we are not seeing that - quite the converse in fact. The numbers look worse than ‘08/‘09, by a huge measure. 

I’m very worried, and with happy-talking folk like Mnuchin running the show, you should be very worried too."
2020-06-10 16:32:52,"Let's be clear what economic stimulus is. That is taking money from federal income taxpayers (the middleclass for the most part, not businesses, not the wealthy, not the poor) and giving it to businesses to favor the wealthy. This money is either in the form of cash or debt, but mostly debt to be paid by the middleclass. The GOP now wants to say debt and deficits don't matter. Not to those who don't pay a high percentage of taxes they don't. And if that were true, why tax at all? You could just monetize your federal spending and pay for government through the devaluation of the dollar. That way those with the most assets pay the most. God forbid, we can't have that. No, we need to shift the burden to the middleclass for sure."

Clinton    Up 70.8%
Obama    Up 61.0%
GHW Bush  Up 41.7%
Trump     Up 37.2%
Reagan.    Up 19.5%
GW Bush    Down 4.2%

All the GOP “trickle down” tax law changes put money in the pockets of the wealthy while the working class folks’ real income has been flat for decades. The National Debt under the GOP grows even faster. Aside from Trump dismantling  society’s safety nets, supporting international dictators, and allowing him and his family to mooch off the government, there are no logical reasons to support Trump’s re-election, from any quarter.

Right now, there is a glittering evidence of that, stunning and awesome.  But also through the last several decades.  A steadily raising curve, enriching the so-called shareholders no matter what.  The evidence is irrefutable.  Any objections are futile.  The so-called economy, employment, inflation etc. is peanuts, for losers to bang their heads about."

I work in the live performance business, and have for 3 decades.  I don't make a lot of money, but I love what I do, and that has always been my trade-off.  I am on unemployment for the first time in my life, and if the government stops offering the additional PUA support to me, while I wait for theaters to be allowed to go back into business, I will have to enter the job market.  I will become a 54 year-old man competing with everyone else for reduced numbers of retail, and other sector jobs.

Those industries with workers which are not allowed to go back to functioning for the next few months need to have those workers supported.  If not the general work-force will be overwhelmed with skilled workers who just need to pay for food and rent.  On our 1040's we list our professions.  If we are on union payrolls, its clear what work we do.  The government needs to coordinate with unions, the IRS, and municipalities to support certain workers (like performers, stagehands, designers, set builders and painters) so they both don't overwhelm the weakened job market, and are available to go back to work as soon as possible.

I am sure there are other industries which are similarly effected, and those workers should also be put in this suspended animation of receiving money as they await the moment when they can work again."
2020-06-10 16:58:35,"Secretary Mnuchin, make sure you remember about the millions of Americans still suffering on a daily basis worrying constantly about how to make ends meet. No matter how rosy a picture your boss paints about the economy you know the real story. And perhaps you can also speak to Mitch McConnell about how difficult these millions of Americans still have it. Senator McConnell seems quite comfortable continuing to take his sweet time in addressing further economic aid to individuals. Remind him that what he sees in his own world from his ivory perch is not reality."
2020-06-10 16:59:34,"The administration ""was also considering the need for more direct payments to Americans and adjustments to unemployment insurance benefits to ensure that people did not have incentives to remain jobless.""

More direct payments are necessary, $1200.00 EIP is throughly insufficient to keep the debt collectors away.  And those ADJUSTMENTS to unemployment insurance benefits? Does that mean shortening pay-out periods or reducing benefits? 

This economic situation is not going away anytime soon and the threat of reducing benefits or taking away benefits entirely, certainly will not get people back to work or incentivize them to do anything more than they already are. What it will do is threaten their well being, their families, their health, their homes. It will in fact show them that their government does not care for them or their future. 

Last I looked there were 40 million unemployed people in this country. And in my family, there were 3 more added just yesterday."
2020-06-10 17:02:13,"If they don't help out individuals now with direct payments, it's going to be exponentially more expensive to help people who become homeless, etc. later on. It's better to help people help themselves than to create another layer of homelessness and forever-debt-cycle. It is the humane thing to do and also the more cost effective thing to do.

And corporations do not need bail outs. They are not people. They do not become homeless."
2020-06-10 17:06:34,"Without slightest intent to be malicious, we can go on like this for a long time.  Unemployment horrendous, the govt prints money at will, maintains semblance of normal life thereby, the money massively flows into the stock markets and makes the shareholders richer and richer at the expense of the simple folks and as an utter affront to common sense and all those unemployed.  Why not continue?  What will happen?  Inflation?  C'mon, we already printed quite a bit, not only now, whenever there is a trouble we print and it does solve issues, with no side-effects. So, yes, bring it on, new stimulus, and then quickly start on another one.  We can and we should print out our way back to prosperity.  Only details need to be hammered."

The second, smaller, tranche expires in Mid July. That is when will see the unemployment jump again as the small businesses that tried to hang on, close again. The spike in COVID cases in nineteen states will spook consumers into staying away from public spaces except the most necessary. Wall St. is NOT the economy and Wall St. is oblivious to the breadth and depth of small business collapse and the effects it has on consumption."
2020-06-10 17:22:28,"Yes, take a deep breath Mr. Mnuchin, you have time to do it right and make this round of direct checks mean-tested. I know at least five couples in their thirties/forties who switched to working from home without losing one paycheck; they have good jobs, nice homes and bank accounts.  They all took their checks and put them in the bank. Merry Christmas.

On the other hand I know two seventy year old women living in their tiny cottages living on $1,100 a month social security payments They immediately spent the money on necessities and put the stimulus checks back into the economy.

However if you insist on sending money to every American citizen, you might try adding pre-loaded credit cards that can only be used at restaurants (including diners, fast food and take out joints). $250 per adult and child. That will help get that industry back up on its feet! And that industry is totally crippled about now..."

Why do interest rates need to be zero for Wall St., hedge funds and private equity while millions of ""borrowers"" using credit cards still pay upwards of 20% on their balances?

Why do prudent savers bear the brunt of this massive transfer of wealth from the (now scarce) middle class to the 1%? Why isn't there more of an outcry? It sure looks like Wall St. calls the shots. It did so in Dec. 2018 and it was confirmed when Powell raised the white flag on interest rate hikes a month later. It has only gotten worse since then."
2020-06-10 17:30:26,"Based upon the previous stimulus, I highly suspect this is just another excuse to shovel money at Trump-supporting companies and industries. Mnuchin has yet to distribute the last stimulus, so it may have been too restricted to give away to largest Republican charities, or to favorable toward small companies, which, for some reason can't get much needed loans already funded."
2020-06-10 16:55:53,Saying this next amount of stimulus is going to go to the needy is laughable at the least and unbelievable at most. That’s like saying Trump doesn’t lie.

2020-06-10 17:39:22,"Adjust stimulus payments to discourage people from remaining unemployed?  Really?  How about not giving large tax cuts to the richest people and corporations in America and encouraging the latter to part with their money by hiring employees, training employees, and in general being good corporate citizens instead of draining our coffers to save themselves money?  How about mandating a decent living wage instead of forcing people to supplement meager wages with government subsidized programs that don't begin to solve the problems?  

In other words, what part of social safety net and employee rights (as well as our rights) does Mnuchin not understand?  The same questions can be asked of the GOP.  They go out of their way to support their richest donors.  Then, when we the people need help, it's too much trouble or there's no money to spare."

Any collateral damage to Main St. will have to be a secondary consideration- if at all.

And with all of that, he has loyal followers. I just don't understand it."

Trump has zero interest in any of that and his disconnect to those who are not in his right wing base will doom his re-election.  Unfortunately, he has destroyed the economy for years to come."

There is also a chance for better quality education for all Americans of all backgrounds. None of these very laudable goals will happen in a Trump administration.

Please don't tell me we can't act like authoritarian china, the American people won't submit to being locked down.  The American people by and large did submit to being locked down, which is why the curve which stopped from gaining a higher level.  Only America acted way too late and is paying a price, both money and lives, the others didn't have to pay. 

So those of you looking for who blame for this, you don't have far to look.  Trump supporters can look to themselves for giving him the chance to delay and diminish response, and all those who refused to lock down can look to themselves for increasing the spread.  The rest of us don't have far to look, either.  We look at you."

This of course will prop up the markets, but for the working stiff, and especially those who are returning to work with reduced hours or not at all, it won't help them pay the rent, it won't help the states balance their budgets(which will result in lay-offs for police, fire, teachers and all first responders).

People to help kids learn, people to do contact tracing, people to rebuild infrastructure, people to take on the social service and mental health tasks that the police end up doing, people willing to BE police officers in cities and precincts that want to reform, people to take care of.  People can be trained to work with others in crisis, to work with those who want to get off the streets, to teach little kids how to love reading, to teach English to newcomers.

If only there could be well-funded and responsibly administered training and job programs leading to meaningful work that doesn't directly affect multinational corporations' bottom lines and offshore accounts. This is what the real people's economy will need to recover. There's so much work to be done and many folk craving to be useful."

2020-06-10 19:24:54,"I am so angry about this notion that receiving the Federal supplement of $600, in addition to whatever paltry state unemployment, is somehow leading to people who are not incentivized to work.  I am unemployed with no current prospects and stand a real chance of having to pivot to something completely new.  My old salary was around 200K.  Understand that UI is NOT a goldmine and with 40 MILLION of us, out of work, the only way we can hope to survive is through extending the federal benefits or start dipping into our modest retirement funds.  The states have a limited timeline for benefits and the federal aid will end in less than 2 months.  It is the height  of judgement and cruelty to lambaste people who are out of work and trying to survive on this limited social safety net. (Don't forget trying to pay for insurance, as well).  If the federal aid is not extended, people will truly be forced out of their homes and into food pantries. I WANT to work again."
2020-06-10 19:27:24,"This is the standard Republican playbook. 1. Claim that the Democratic President did not do enough for the economy and Republicans are the only ones who can do more. 2. Get into office on promises to working Americans, but give away huge deficit tax cuts to the wealthiest. 3. Cut back on all social services, protections and regulations, claiming this will pay for the tax cuts and grow the economy. 4. Mishandle natural and man-made disasters. Blow up the economy. Bailout the wealthiest and turn all the damages over to Democrats to fix. 5. Start all over again, claiming Democrats didn't pick up the pieces fast enough.

How many Americans want to repeat this cycle as the country devolves into total wreckage like many South American and African nations where right wing military supported dictatorships run rampant like Trump and his police state?"
2020-06-10 19:31:00,"It is simply amazing the disconnect between reality and the stock market these days.

Let's think about this. We will have high structural unemployment for at least the next few years.  Earnings are going to be highly stressed due to lack of demand.  Even though we are borrowing line crazy, long term interest rates point clearly toward deflation meaning it will be harder rather than easier to pay down debt. Speaking of debt, look at corporate debt these days.

And all of those retail businesses like stores and restaurants, do you honestly think all of those are going to come back in any time frame?  No.

After the last crash in early 2008, EPS was in the mid teens. Today we are in the mid 30's.  What the?

We are in for a very long bumpy ride."
2020-06-10 19:32:37,"“Fed officials indicated that they expected the unemployment rate to end 2020 at 9.3 percent and remain elevated for years...”

Trump didn’t like to clean up the messes arising out of mismanagement of his businesses - he bailed out, leaving others to hold the bag.  Perhaps he should consider doing that now (just resign)— he’s incapable of bringing the economy he destroyed from COVID inaction back to life as that takes hard work, as Obama did.  Just let Joe Biden come in and clean up for Trump and the Republicans. This would require McConnell and ilk to be defeated at the polls. Let November be the time to clean house."

Whether the Republican party likes it or not, this country includes all its citizens.  Republicans seem to think that if you are a liberal...certainly half the country, you are not a real American.  Blue states pay more than their fair share and many that live here came to live in America while we were still a colony."

COVID is getting worse both in the US and internationally, and we should not expect a working vaccine in the near future.

Trump’s perverse anti-competence continues to disrupt the American response.

There can be no progress in health or economics until Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021.  

President Biden can start the healing.  It will take years to restore America and the World, but with Trump gone we will at least have some hope."

You ignored the COVID epidemic in the beginning when it might have been controllable, so it got much worse.  Then the lock downs began and again no action from you.  You then started talking about how wonderful the economy was going to be after these stupid, freedom squashing  lock downs were over.  Now the Fed is painting a picture that almost all other knowledgeable people saw coming of a long deep recession.

Small shopping centers, and many stores in strip malls, and along the main roadways in town after town will be shuddered.  Property owners will declare bankruptcy.  Lawyers will have a lot of business.

House foreclosures will reach a 20 year high.
People young enough to invest in property will secure their futures as they struggle through the present.

People living in condominiums will see their home’s value decrease as their monthly HOA fees rise but amenities will disappear because of the foreclosures. As the units vacate the decrease in HOA revenue will decrease amenities.

The cost of weddings and other celebrations will go down, as venues disappear, and the remaining struggle to stay viable. 

There will be 25% fewer restaurants to chose from by the end of 2020.

Many floors in high rise office buildings will be vacated. Many will lose so much of their tenancy that only the first floors will be occupied.

With an overpopulated country loaded with debt, stagnant wages, a hard pressed middle class, racial conflict, rampant financial speculation and now a pandemic; the house is showing signs of imminent collapse. Powell and Mnuchin can talk and talk about what they are going to do, but all they have at their disposal are smoke and mirrors. If the house is going to be saved it's going to take big ideas and big people to do it. I'm not going to hold my breath.A pretty sad situation and a rotten legacy to leave to young people."

The majority of Americans want health care, retirement benefits and a paycheck, not  a handout. But right now, it is needed to get people through this crisis and many jobs will not be coming back. Many employed people are also seeing their salaries slashed not just once,  but twice.

Others will find that their incomes are down under 100% of the FPL, and, if in the 14 red states that have not expanded Medicaid, they will have no coverage at all.

A horrible surprise for some people who do get switched into a Medicaid (income to 138% of FPL in states that did expand Medicaid) is that that coverage is not insurance at all in many of those states, for people 55 and older.  It's only a loan. 

The bills paid out, in at least 10 states (e,g, MA, NJ, and MD), are subject, for people 55 and older, to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.  It's a loan until death for medical expenses, not insurance, and people with this financial bomb often are unaware, due to inconspicuous notice by the relevant agencies.

About 8 states fixed the problem, partly or completely, starting in main ACA provision year 2014, by amending their estate recovery policies.  E.g.: NY and CA.  (Making at least all ACA expanded Medicaid coverage real insurance.)

But many states did not.  People will be getting switched to Medicaids now, thinking the government has their back.  And boy, will they, or their kids, be surprised."

In point of fact the Fed was talking about unemployment rates as high as 15% but we had a rate down around 9%.

That kind of a move would actually fire up the economy, in a win-win situation for our decrepit roads, bridges, highways, etc., and for the people who would be given jobs to fix them.

And people don’t want to go back to work and risk their lives for poverty level wages.  How about paying a living wage for a change?  That $600 a week we are getting on unemployment?  That’s the MINIMUM we should all be making!  Maybe if we weren’t paid so poorly $600 a week wouldn’t look so good.  $600/week is only $31,000 a year.  That’s barely enough to pay rent on a little apartment in cheap areas of the country.  Think about the fact that so many workers make less than that. It feels like a big raise to them.  Why should anyone go back to a risky job for less than that? 

I think this is the GOP’s greatest fear-the days of ultra cheap labor will be over if we refuse to work for peanuts anymore.  And now that we have all had a taste of what life would be like with at least $15/hour,  we may not meekly submit to wage slavery anymore."

This is both an understatement and incomplete. This downturn like all of those in the past has fallen as they always have on the shoulders of people of color and in particular on those who trace their roots to Africa.

The movement of Black Lives Matter has a ring to Black Americans more than any others and if considered in this light the idea of an Independent Black America, a national cooperative linked throughout every city and state by education, finance, business, politics and recreation could be the tool which breaks the chains of the present externally imposed dependence.

Insofar as the appeal is based on heritage this thought may be construed as a form of reverse racism which while obvious is also incorrect as many groups of people have shared values and ideas which bind them and in this case no different than social and business groupings of Europeans or Asians.

Certainly the thought of a diverse people binding together in a large scale on the basis of heritage is to some degree foreign to our American mindset, but since our nation's founding Americans of African descent have been held at arms length in physical and/or mental segregation.

If people unite and declare an independence of this sort the voice raised will be heard and heeded while developing the community in a way that since the destruction of the Greenwood neighborhood in Tulsa has rarely occurred.

After all, those who have already been forced to return back to work confront shorter hours and in many cases, lower pay.

The very same applies to gig workers. How much longer will they be able to collect benefits once reopening has begun? Would it not stand to reason that they will be forced off UI as well?

Where is all this presumption of demand going to come from, especially when you factor in depression-like circumstances throughout the world.

What is fueling Wall Street's rally? They must know something we do not; as in how many more trillions they will be getting. Is this why the markets go up? More free money?

Then there are state and local shortfalls, with mass layoffs already beginning. 

Evictions have already started. 

Then there is Covid-19 and how it became an afterthought. 

There is no question that Congress will have to come up with something, but you can also bet on it not being the right kind of aid. Forcing people to go back to work for shorter hours and lower pay is certainly not an answer. Nor will correcting UI in a way that will leave those collecting with less funds.

The combined wealth of America's 565 billionaires in 2017 stood at ""merely"" $2.7 trillion, according to that year's Forbes Global Billionaires list.  ""Fortunately"" by 2020, the number of America's billionaires had increased to 614 and their collective wealth to $2.9 trillion, based on Forbes' most recent list calculated on March 18, 2020.  While 20 million Americans have been tragically put out of work, they can at least feel ""good"" knowing that the number of American billionaires had increased by another 15 people to 629, surging their overall net worth up to $3.2 trillion — a gain that occurred over the course of 23 days during the coronavirus pandemic.   It's likely that Trump's tax reform law — formally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) — passed at the end of 2017 played a role in this three-year wealth growth. While Americans at all income levels, on average, received a tax cut, the benefits were tilted towards the rich who'd see larger average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income.

The virus is running the show. The virus doesn't care that millions are (sadly and understandably) already struggling to pay bills, to go to work at dangerous ""essential"" jobs, to not fall behind on rent, and to eat enough food each day. The virus also does not care if you choose to, incredulously, wear a mask *below your chin*. The virus can and does kill. And the virus is not done with us. Yet by so many of us flouting the virus' rules of *how the world works now* - deluding ourselves into thinking that we're in control, into thinking that we can outspend or outsmart its path - its ugly, furious, cruel resurgence might then maybe wake up enough of us, because then too many people might have lost someone in their life.

Because of Trump's negligence, ineptitude, corruption, he dismantled the Obama-era template for dealing with pandemic, ignored his own intel agencies warnings, and has undermined the very steps that were needed to control the spread. The result is the US, with 5% of global population, has nearly 30% of the cases and deaths and our economy has been harmed to a much greater degree than other nations."
2020-06-09 15:09:22,"I am utterly confused and frustrated.  I'm trying to observe what I believe to be best practices (mask, social distancing, staying home as much as possible, frequent handwashing), but I'm getting whiplash from what feels like a public health community in disarray which provides often contradictory messages. Add the lack of adequate testing and  ontact tracing, PPE, and the continued inability to find hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, and I feel somewhat lost and fear what lies ahead. Is it safe to gather outdoors with masks? Are surfaces a source of transmission? In my state, why can churches reopen with limited capacity but I still can't get a haircut in an establishment that could also limit capacity? Guidance and rules seem so arbitrary.

My family and I have decided we're on our own. We'll continue to limit our non-essential interactions with others, wear masks, and hope for the best."
2020-06-09 15:23:20,"We need to create a culture in which it's okay to say ""we don't know the answer yet."" Public trust in the WHO is arguably the most important element of slowing the spread of coronavirus, yet this is the third time they've had to walk back an overly optimistic claim. Who can trust anything the WHO says now?"
2020-06-09 15:26:25,"We should be differentiating between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic when discussing spread, right? Not that it has many practical implications for day-to-day best practice."
2020-06-09 15:33:58,"There have been proven incidents where an asymptomatic person who never developed symptoms infected others. This was documented in one instance where a woman from China , no symptoms, went to a family get together and infected like four people . And my understanding is that she never developed symptoms.
     I’m just using my logic . There is no way so many people could be infected so quickly if only those showing symptoms spread the virus . That makes no sense ."
2020-06-09 15:09:38,"I read the article yesterday out of the W.H.O. that stated asymptomatic transmission is “rare” and felt my first real optimism that this pandemic may be short lived (months) in terms of completely wrecking our economic and social lives. 
And now this. Years or a vaccine.
No wonder so many are wary of our government being the major funder of W.H.O. when they dropped the ball calling the pandemic a pandemic and now this, among other scientific blunders and missteps. Not that our CDC has done, ‘like, the best ever diseasing in the earth’.
There are excellent scientists, doctors and healthcare professionals at WHO & CDC but the problem, which seems endemic for most of the world’s governing bodies, is poor leadership, lack of accountability and oversight with money to burn. I wonder if someone will be disciplined for letting the walked back article slip out?
Don’t hold your breathe, but do please wear a mask in public no matter how well you feel."
2020-06-09 14:48:58,"Those insurance companies who have been making trillions for years on 'your' health care instead of it going to medical care directly should foot the bill for testing. Your system so values profits over people, and encourages the 'mine' first, screw you attitude. The pandemic numbers worldwide shed light on each countries systems and responses."
2020-06-09 15:26:49,"•You don’t need masks.

•You need masks.

•Half the carriers are asymptomatic.

•Asymptomatics are not carriers.

•This virus is so contagious that you can get infected by touching surfaces.

•Surfaces are safe, it is transmitted via the air that gets inside your mouth and nose.

•Quarantine every package.

•Packages are safe.

Is Trump now the head of the WHO?"
2020-06-09 15:40:30,"And now the NYTimes should walk back it’s defense of the WHO and it’s criticism of trump for criticizing it. And also they should walk back their criticism of Trump for suggesting hydroxychloroquine could help and has few side effects. There are many people that think the left has more experts, or are the pro science group. That is clearly not the case."
2020-06-09 15:42:35,"The bottom line is the medical community is learning and knows very little including mutations if they exist and if a vaccine is possible to even coming out with undoubtedly accurate testing and labs....So policy makers ignored “There is nothing to fear but fear itself”. The only thing we know is that Nursing facilities and policy escalated the death of geriatrics. I’ve seen 15 days of protests not adhering to any safety measures and it’s “reported” there have been no known increase in infections, hospital admissions, or deaths as a result of COVID. I don’t blame Doctors for protecting themselves “Better to err on the side of caution”.
One of the many things anyone can plainly see as a result of protests and riots is that the CDC, WHO etc....in their caution created geo-political ramifications that are bad the extent of which still cannot be determined.
In terms of reopening I saw a comment regarding worship and salons and I agree to try to see logic in theory and not fact is an exercise in futility."
2020-06-09 15:49:21,"There is confusion about two concepts, which are getting mixed up.  The first are the pre-symptomatic - these are the people shown to be very contagious up to two days before symptoms break out.  These are people who are going to get sick.  They are known to have high viral loads.  

The second group are the asymptomatic, a different class.  They test positive but never get symptoms.  While there are no definitive studies on this group (but why not? so frustrating), it is logical to assume they have a lower viral load.  Generally, higher viral load, more symptoms.  Another assumption is that those people with lower viral load would be less transmissible, and this may be part of what is in models.  

Now another confusion are those that strongly hint that masks successfully limited the spread of the virus in Asia.  We don't know the impact of masks, but those countries have serious testing and contact tracing operations.  We have to attribute the vast amount of the credit to that.  Those countries were able to stay open and the businesses continued to operate because of their testing and contact tracing.  But the population also reacted and didn't need to be told to limit their contacts.  Their practice no doubt helped to make the contact tracing work better.  

The key is to keep your mouth shut and do not talk to strangers, and if you must, wear a mask and limit your contact to less than 10 minutes - the shorter the better.  And try to maintain some distance as well."
2020-06-09 14:35:33,"A W.H.O. scientist apparently stirred confusion over whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic persons. So what was this confusion? What did he/she say? On March 9th, Anthony Fauci opined that masks were ineffective; now they are supposedly our first order of defense. So is there really an army of asymptomatic super-spreaders just waiting to infect, or is this just another epidemiological red herring?"
2020-06-09 15:42:37,"Unfortunately, Trump will use this as vindication for his irrational attitude towards the WHO."
2020-06-09 16:13:32,"The Bill and Melissa Gates foundation supports the W.H.O. with massive contributions.  Melissa Gates recently claimed, that while the W.H.O. is ""imperfect"", the world is better off with it. I hope she is right.

And to be fair, there is a ""World Leader"" who appears to have gamed the Covid-19 disaster, to help one of his cronies sell pills that don't work.

In one of these cases, the truth is hard to know; in the other, it's rather obvious."
2020-06-09 16:32:31,"If asymptomatic transmission is common, I also suspect that asymptomatic carriers must be extremely common. This could potentially mean that there are millions, maybe already tens of millions of people who are living with the virus without even knowing it. If this is indeed the case, it would mean that the mortality rate of the disease is far lower than currently estimated.

We all read the horror stories of young and healthy people struck down by the disease, but the reason why we hear these stories, is because they ""make news"" far more than the milder cases. I have a relative in the Italian city of Bergamo, where the elderly population was tragically decimated by the epidemic, who works as a doctor. She was exposed to the virus in the early phases of the pandemic and was tested positive in March. She was quarantined for two weeks, had virtually no symptoms, and after a negative second test she went back to work in the hospital. She is in her early thirties. 

Her husband, my cousin, caught the virus from her and was bedridden with what he described as a ""very unpleasant"" flu. But again, 2-3 weeks later he was out of it. People like this don't make the news. How many millions more are there? What is the real impact of this disease? 

I am beginning to suspect that other than being absolutely lethal for older people and causing nasty effects on a small random subset of the younger population, on a purely statistical basis it might not be as bad as we think."

This is one of those rare moments.....his criticisms of the WHO are right on, in fact they are a mild statement of the WHO's corruption."

2020-06-09 16:26:12,"More than 2 million infected, 113,000 deaths by far more than any other country in the world. Deeply in debt and deeply divided. Mile long food lines everywhere. Our country used to be admired and envied now they pity us. That is Trump's America."
2020-06-09 16:28:23,"It's well documented that one of the first international transmissions of the virus occurred when a couple attended services at a Singapore church the same day they had flown in from Wuhan. They did not develop symptoms for several days. Several days after that, 5 people from that church developed symptoms. As it turned out, several of them were sitting close to the couple from Wuhan that day, and another sat in the same seat at a later service.
Asymptomatic transmission is real and common and crucial to the spread of the virus. Dr. Kerkhove should be ashamed of herself. She's exhibiting one of the worst delusions scientists are prey to: sticking to the model when it contradicts direct observation.
She hasn't even made a clear statement: did she mean people who test positive but never show symptoms? Or did she really mean people like the couple in Singapore, and is she denying they were the source of the infection in the other church-goers?"

2020-06-09 16:38:23,"This focus on asymptomatic cases is the road to madness.

How on earth can we begin thinking that ANYONE might have some invisible contagion that has no symptoms? That is the surest path to insanity, imagining that people who are not sick, never have been, and never will be should be considered to be infected.

No wonder people are beginning to rebel against restrictions, when this is the idiotic magical thinking that is being presented to us by so-called experts as science, it seems the idiots in charge know even less about the virus that they did months ago. This does not inspire confidence in scientists or authorities.

Everyone is going to have to return to their lives, we cannot hide in our basement and we are masks forever believing in some invisible contagion that spreads among us and yet does not make anyone sick, again, this is the path to insanity."

2020-06-09 16:36:15,"I am sorry to see that Trumpists and other right-wingers have such a problem with two very simple things about science:

1. Scientific knowledge evolves over time, as we learn more.

2. With scientific institutions, there is supposed to be room for intelligent disagreement and discussion. 

I’m equally sorry to see a passel of other intellectual failures.

1. When WHO and others first found out about this virus, it took bit of time to be sure that there was such a thing as human transmission.

2. The initial advice to the public often erred on the side of caution.

3. It also took time to collect data on transmission methods, and on such matters as this virus’ persistence on surface. The data collection is still going on.

4. This led to a fair amount of, “best guess is, let’s all be safe out there, wash your hands a lot, try to stay home,” advice. It was epidemiological meat and potatoes. It worked. Now some finer tuning is going on.

5. We are probably opening back up too fast, and far too sloppy. We will have to see, though. 

6. The garbage coming from Trump has zero to do with the science, or public health, or even the economics: it has to do with him getting re-elected.

7. It would have been better if we had a less greedy, more competent President. It would be better now, as we need far better testing, contact tracing, public health measures, and preparation for what is probably coming in the Fall."
2020-06-09 16:40:42,"WHO continues its exemplary response to the pandemic.  I mean, really, who would be so shortsighted not to believe without a shadow of doubt to what they say?

More seriously, they can say and take back all they want, it may only interests people who have faith in them, which by now should be few.  Each country does what it thinks it needs to do anyway.  I am more concerned about the phony and trivial studies of questionable scientific value which are now proliferated everywhere and used with a heavily political slant (for example the one blasting HCQ and popularized here, not any more)."

Point is, the WHO, when it comes to pandemic response, is almost useless. Sometimes worse than useless, as we see in yesterday's comment on asymptomatic transmission.

He's wrong about defunding it, though, just as law enforcement critics are wrong to push for defunding the police. We should be using our economic leverage with them to enact reforms to make them better able to respond to our needs in the future ... because this is far from the last pandemic we're going to see."

2020-06-09 18:01:35,"The WHO is creating confusion about the infectivity of Coronaviruses with statements like the one mentioned here.. 

There are no good data on the number of virions necessary to initiate clinically symptoms. While coronaviruses seem to be more efficiently transferred by aerosols and droplets other means might be as efficient and another route might be efficient, with the source not having evident symptoms at the stage where they can still transmit an adequate number of virus particles to lead to clinical  infection in another individual

Thus, one also has to consider the overall health of the ""recipient"" and the number of virus particles transmitted and the site of contact, as well as the route of exposure.

There are many variables and interactions in determining whether a person develops clinical symptoms after exposure to this or any infectious agent.. 

The point is this  (or any infectious disease) is not a simple system that lends itself to glittering generalities. Such simplification is dangerous."

Talk about walking something back, Trump walks back many of the things he says in the same sentence!"
2020-06-09 17:36:49,"I believe we should introduce a new phrase ""pre-symptomatic"". That would clarify a lot when it comes to Covid-19. Because Dr. Van Kerkhove is basically right: real a-symthomatic transmission is probably really rare.

What's the difference?

An a-symptomatic patient never gets the disease. He never shows any kind of symptoms. His or her body fights the virus so hard and early on that it never has a chance to spread. Their blood is teeming with antibodies, but you'd have a Dickens of a time to find them with a normal swab test.

A pre-symptomatic patient on the other hands is free of symptoms one minute, but can start coughing and sweating the very next. And that is the danger: the pre-symptomatic patient is at his or her peak of infectiousness just days and hours before showing the first symptoms.

This virus still has a lot of surprises in store for us. I guess most of these vaccines in development will work. But I predict that they won't work very long (or at least not in all people).

Corona seems to be closer related to the common cold than to the flu. And since we have been searching for a common cold vaccine since the word ""vaccine"" was invented I won't start dancing in the streets until it's been proven to work long term (let's say: 12 month).

Now, please imagine you live in a world where you have to get a shot every 12 month or you have a 4.5% chance to die (minimum, based on German mortality, and we test like crazy).

Their agenda and the Chinese agenda are one and the same. And when the CDC bows to political correctness and says that racism is more dangerous than COVID, they are really saying that the battle against the virus has been lost and they want to deflect blame. Other than health care professionals who are risking their lives daily, the other real heroes are ordinary people who have no economic choice but to go out and serve the public and risk their health by doing so."
2020-06-09 17:21:56,"The statement by the epidemiologist in question concerns a statistic: people who aren't coughing, aren't running a fever, aren't sniffling probably have a lower viral load and are therefore less likely to communicate the virus to somebody else, all other factors being equal (no intimate contact). This same goes for HIV: somebody with an undetectable level of virus is less likely to transmit it to a partner. But that's not to say an infected person with an undetectable viral load can't transmit HIV (as a recent add for a med claims).

So masks for everybody are a necessity in the age of COVID-19, and protected sex for unknown partners together with a test for HIV every year for those 12 years old and up are a necessity as well."

2020-06-09 16:59:44,"What many people do not understand is that our understanding of this virus continues to evolve. As more data is accumulated, we can expect current procedures to change which is typical of science.  What is ATYPICAL is that the president of the United States has failed to make data accumulation automatic, comprehensive and cumulative. Said simply, every instance of every COVID case should be combined into one CDC database so that anomalies can be learned. 

When the report was issued that COVID drug Remdesivir is in short supply, I was completely horrified. Trump has time to play golf and send out hundreds of nonsensical Tweets but not enough time to organize & mobilize the country to deal with this crisis. Former President Dwight Eisenhower must be rolling over in his grave witnessing Trump's appalling performance as commander in chief."
2020-06-09 17:20:20,"The effects of opening up in both China and the United States, the former (we think) well justified, the latter premature, are to put pressure on the other economies of the world that if they don't do the same they will lose out in a competitive global market.  Russia is being quite reckless, Brazil is in full and complete denial of reality.  

India is slightly different:  Their informal economic sector is too vast for them to maintain a shut down without massive numbers of people starving. But I'm sure they are feeling the pressure too.  At 10K cases per 24 hours, there is no way they will not be overwhelmed, and they do know it.  But the reckless opening of other countries is putting pressure on them too, and at that case rate, will result in countless deaths.

This political, and irresponsible, forced reopening by the American capitalists, headed by Donald Trump, is and will kill tens, maybe hundreds of thousands worldwide.  Although we do not have anywhere near the kind of just legal system in place in the world to hold him and his co-conspirators responsible, in such a just world this would be a crime against humanity of the first order.

BTW, I disagree with your use of the phrase ""walks back"". Dr. Van Kerkhove did not misspeak, she didn't include enough context.  Figuring out what context is necessary when talking to reporters isn't easy for scientists, one never knows what the reporters know or think they know."

2020-06-09 15:30:57,"We are continuing to wear masks whenever we go out to grocery stores. We will keep washing our hands and staying at home as much as possible. I don't know what more we can do. It seems like the rest of the world around us has gone mad and thinks it has gained immortality, just because the governor said it's OK for businesses to reopen. Case numbers in our urban county are not only increasing, they are now consistently spiking. We had our biggest day ever for new case numbers yesterday. Yet people continue to act as if the virus has simply vanished because Republicans told it to. I sympathize with the protesters, but they are endangering themselves and everyone they cone into contact with. There are no good answers here, and, as usual in the US, it comes down to every man for himself. We have 365 million people making their own decisions for themselves about how to handle a pandemic."
2020-06-09 15:43:04,"The W.H.O (and everybody else) needs a better method for reviewing / vetting ideas before publishing. A friend sent me an email this morning saying that the virus is NOT spread by people without symptoms according to the W.H.O. Now, the W.H.O is retracting this idea only a couple days after first publishing it.

False information is born so easily and lasts for a very long time."
2020-06-09 17:09:26,"My three grown sons are now home due to college/work related issues.   My youngest son had an exposure to someone who tested positive-much ado was made of this.  My son tested negative but was quarantined in the house (five days) and all fine as he had his mom (me) tending to his needs, cooking, coffees, etc.  I don’t know what to expect for the duration of the summer, fall, etc, with no reality of a drug/vaccine on the horizon, but there has to be a better system than this.  It’s unrealistic to think college aged, high school etc, are going to stay at home for many months and not have exposures or get their families sick.  I see no end in sight to this, so I’m just looking for a realistic solution- which means take your chances on exposure or have the economy completely fall apart, or both?  We have a relatively comfortable situation for our stay at home situation but I am feeling a bit of despair."
2020-06-09 19:26:02,"Here's a new approach - plain, straight, honest talk and common sense actions.  Science, analytics, and medicine are critically important to controlling the virus over the long-term.  However, building a strong economy,  ensuring the education of youth at both the K-12 and college level in the proven immersive classroom environment, and addressing the racial/socio-economic disparities will do far more to save lives in the long-run than trying to manage deaths to zero now since it simply cannot be done.  From the known facts, the risk of covid to people in good health (not obese, not diabetic/pre-diabetic, hypertensive) is generally low.  We also know that the risk for those under 40 in good health is really low, and extremely low for <30 in good health.  Let the low risk groups get back to work and be active in society with common sense measures like masks.  For those at risk, they should protect themselves.  There are some uncomfortable issues with that statement: at-risk professors and school teachers may need to retire or find a new line of work, for those not willing to return to the workplace - they hopefully have savings until a vaccine is found. Employers should be required to implement safe environmental practices and then let their employees make an educated choice."
2020-06-09 19:39:26,"Since I've been watching a lot more TV during the lockdown, I've noticed about every other commercial is for a prescription drug.  I need to ""ask my doctor"" if the drug is right for me.  Basically, I need to let my doctor know that I need a drug and see if they will give it to me.  I'm sure many gladly will whether I need it or not, otherwise the commercials wouldn't work and the pharmaceutical companies wouldn't be spending so much money to put so many of them out there.  Then, I watch the news and constantly get conflicting information from medical ""experts"" about the coronavirus and COVID-19, showing that they pretty much have no idea what's really going on with this virus or disease, even after 6 months. 

I'm pretty much convinced at this point that if the medical ""experts"" don't have a drug they can prescribe (or I can ask about) and send me on my way, they pretty much don't have any idea what to do or recommend.  I guess I'll just have to wait for the commercial that recommends I ask my doctor about a new drug to treat COVID-19, despite the side effects of cancer or suicidal thoughts.  But maybe the FDA will fast track it, so there won't be time to figure out the side effects and they won't be listed and I won't have to worry about it until I get cancer or suicidal thoughts.  But at least I won't have COVID-19...maybe.  The tests aren't very accurate.

Welcome to 21st century medicine."
2020-06-09 20:07:46,I'm strongly inclined to give credence to the World Health Organization even if politicians try to discredit it. That's not to say WHO can't make a mistake but politicians make many many more.
2020-06-09 20:15:36,"The experts keep waffling on whether you can get Covid19 from surfaces, or whether asymptomatic transmission is common. While the degree of threats  change based on the latest daily speculations, the consequences are very real and indisputable. In Brookline, I just heard someone say his commercial tenant has not paid rent in 3 or 4 months. Lives are on the verge of ruin, while the Masters of the Universe go back and forth on masks, surfaces, or asymptotic persons are only minimal or serious threats. Who really knows as a matter of general inference what is good for all? That's why we have a constitution."
2020-06-09 20:46:50,"On the subject of asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus, I can't help but wonder how scientists could possibly know with statistical certainty that this is a major source or an unlikely one.

We're talking voodoo science here if anyone claims knowledge of large numbers of instances in which several victims were infected from asymptomatic carriers. Large numbers of cases required for reliable statistics.  I'll concede that in small numbers of carefully selected cases -- as conceded by the WHO scientist -- the possibility of transmission could be proven.

But to get large number statistics the research must follow traceability methodologies. For symptomatic transmission, if one person gets very sick -- verified by testing -- one checks his contacts and finds additional sick victims and infers that the source of transmission is that initial sick person.  But just exactly how do you prove that a  group of people all became sick from an asymptomatic source if that person had no symptoms that would justify testing him? Possible, and achievable in select cases, but not a highly likely scenario."
2020-06-09 21:12:04,"Both parties need to recognize that the supplemental unemployment payment is a major disincentive for people to go back to work.  Please ask a few economists to weigh in.

At a very fundamental level it creates a moral hazard:  people getting paid to stay home are being supported by taxes on the paychecks of those who are risking getting sick by going to their ""essential"" jobs.  Most of those people are relatively low income.

From the start, if Congress was going to pay people an extra $600 to stay safe, they should have sent a check for twice that much to the people still going to work as well as covering their medical bills and sick leave if they did get sick.

No one -- R or D -- is truly fighting for working people in Congress right now."
2020-06-09 18:56:59,"I am distressed at how absolute the media and officials have been in requiring masks and stay-at-home, when the more we hear from WHO, the more we hear that you cannot easily get Covid19 from asymptomatic transmission, nor from surfaces. Now the parents want to reverse course and tell us the real narrative is uncertainty. In Boston, people accost and yell at me if I am not wearing a mask outside, and it's too late, you have set off a panic where everyone is absolute certain that I am typhoid mary if I am outside."
2020-06-09 19:37:10,"These wild conspiracy theories that trump embraces now more persistently than ever are more than deliberate distractions. They're symptoms of desperation.  Mueller testified on nation-wide TV that his report includes ten indictable instances of trump’s nefarious deeds while in office, but that trump as president was shielded from prosecution by DOJ policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. It appears trump enjoys similar protection for unrestrained libelous assertions he makes from the presidential bully pulpit almost daily. trump must know that if and when he loses he’ll face prosecution. The inevitable prospect of prison time looms menacingly on the horizon."

Even the NY Times is playing along, trying to calm the skittish and those itchy to get out.

2020-06-09 20:40:13,"What a joke. This thing has been a political scam since the beginning. Yes, the virus is real. Yes, it affected mostly 65+ elderly in nursing homes. Yes, it is basically behind us, as we're in the tail of the pandemic curve. But coupled with this, it has been used to spread fear on an unprecedented scale and scientific voices of reason trying to show data which suggested otherwise were silenced and censored. I see that WHO's admission that this thing does not spread asymptomatically was probably not well-received by those who wish to continue fear mongering in order to push a vaccine. So, here we are again. Hopefully the average person is learning to think for themselves and seeing beyond this propaganda and manipulation by now. As thousands have crowded the street, it will soon be revealed that this thing is beyond us. Many states are already back to business as usual. Reject the fear and hysteria."
2020-06-09 19:40:29,"Perhaps the WHO would have the time and human resources to do more if Trump, in yet another tantrum, hadn't pulled it's biggest contributor's funding.   And the CDC's budget has been shredded."
2020-06-09 19:42:40,"why is this such a big deal? even if asymptomatic folks generally don't infect others, it would still make sense to take the current precautions. I don't want to be jammed in a packed train at the moment the guy in my face has his first cough and I certainly don't want to be in that situation with either of us unmasked! bottom line- this is a respiratory virus and it stands to reason that universal masking would diminish risk, so why would anyone not want to wear a mask?"
2020-06-09 20:32:25,"How is ""Fauci describes the virus as his 'worst nightmare'"" a news alert?  Please focus on providing facts, rather than opinions that continue to fuel hysteria.  Not all of your readers have a nice work-from-home arrangement, country homes, and savings to last them through a lockdown that may last years.  The economic, emotional, and personal hardship the lockdown has caused is worthy of reporting and should not be downplayed.  It is not political either.  It is a fact.  There should be more reporting on understanding how to assess risk holistically.  There are lots of risks out there: driving, swimming, exercising, traveling, etc.  All of these activities and more carry risks, some through contagion, and most can be significantly reduced by staying home (just look at stats on car accidents in the past couple of months), and yet, somehow, we used to find it reasonable to get out of our homes before the pandemic.  We had this understanding that life was not risk free and that it was worth going out and not crushing the global economy and creating mass-scale poverty.  How do we measure the COVID risk in this context?  Has COVID become the #1 cause of death in the world?  Please report on this instead.  We have to find a reasonable approach rather than assume we will all weather the storm by staying at home."
2020-06-09 19:48:35,Maybe WHO doctors should consult with their peers before jumping to conclusions?
2020-06-09 20:04:12,"Dr. Fauci would be most useful working from the outside right about now.

Trump and his henchmen have been putting up roadblocks since before the pandemic was recognized for what it is internally or publicly. Now that Fauci is no longer part of Trump's media show he needs to continue advising the public daily, hourly if needed. He can't do that from his seat in Trump's federal government. 

Lamar Alexander is looking to crowdsource ideas? Here's one: bring Fauci to a Senate hearing on what is needed from here on out to ensure that the current pandemic and pandemics to come aren't mismanaged, the American people aren't skimped on or made to go to work and their deaths ever again.

This time next year, it is my hope that the Democratic administration to come will have the moral and intestinal fortitude to put all of Trump's henchmen and Trump himself on public trials for crimes against humanity.

This administration has been a constant horror show."
2020-06-09 20:06:25,"Interesting how the response to Dr. Van Kerkhove's statement has been met with a paroxysm of sanctimonious bleating from her fellow epidemiologists warning of the dire public policy consequences of her remarks. And they should know! We put 42 million people out of work and brought the nation's food pantries to their knees for the sake of their grossly inflated infection models.  I'm still wondering what happened to the 3,000 daily deaths and 233k daily new cases octogenarian Anthony Fauci & Co. promised by June 1st - it came and went with numbers not even close. Still academic entrepreneurs continue peddling overheated forecasts. Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia is now confidently assuring us of an apocalyptic surge in cases by August dwarfing anything thus far. Another in a long succession of absurd prognostications resulting in disastrous public policy."
2020-06-09 20:14:51,"More than ever, it is important that we choose the right words to reflect the meaning we intend. I just listened to the WHO social media feed which addressed what the NYT headline says was the ‘walk back’ WHO took on the ‘very rare’ evidence of asymptomatic people’s ability to spread the Covid-19 virus. I had previously listened to the WHO press conference at which Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove made those comments. I do not hear that the WHO did a ‘walk back.’ The media required a clarification of what was said at the press conference and WHO provided a lively Q&A session which elevated all sorts of questions from normal folks around the globe. The WHO staff was pleased and energized by questions from the public, obviously. They were very, very good questions. I daresay, many were much better questions than from the press briefings, and these real life, real people questions reflect that many people are listening carefully, with their thinking caps firmly attached.  What the NYT headline called a ‘walk back’ was really a clarification. The clarification was that the ‘very rare’ spread from ‘asymptomatic’ people was in answer to a very specific question at the press conference about a very small observational study. I listened to that press briefing - that seemed clear to me at the time. To wake today and find it had been made to look as if the WHO misspoke surprised me. Press needs to listen carefully and not jump on some bandwagon of dogging the very people doing their best to lead"

2020-06-09 18:36:33,"From the article:   “I was just responding to a question, I wasn’t stating a policy of W.H.O. or anything like that,” she said. 

Personally, I think the news media sometimes doesn’t understand what they’re hearing where science is concerned. They jumped on what they thought they heard and caused a big mess."
2020-06-09 18:37:27,"It's fun to throw the CDC and WHO under the bus, but if you read the actual transcript, one of Van Kerkhove's points was that, in many cases, there were symptoms, but they weren't the widely-publicized COVID symptoms, like fever and cough. Then she bumbled over to the 'fact' that those found via contact tracing hadn't infected many others. Well, doctor, that's why smart countries have contact tracing - to reach people before they infect others. SO... let's not call this a flip-flop by WHO, but rather a mangled communication by a fine professional who will no longer be given the microphone."
2020-06-09 18:49:33,"Once again, we are caught in a ""trust no one"" dilemma.  Neither the WHO, the CDC, the ""scientific experts"" and certainly not the president can be trusted when they roll out advice on what we need to do to protect ourselves from coronavirus infection.  The only sane course is to assume that if you don't take all available measures to avoid it—stay away from crowds, wear a mask when you go out, wash your hands frequently throughout the day, disinfect anything that comes into your home before you use it, eat it, or preferably even touch it, and do anything else you can think of to avoid infection—you will be risking your life."
2020-06-09 19:15:20,I always like it when a public figure has to “walk back” something. It usually happens when they say what they really mean and then discover that the statement was unpopular in some way.
2020-06-09 19:19:54,"Why wouldn't asymptomatic people be able to spread Covid-19. Just exhaling emits coronavirus aerosols. Stands to reason.

2020-06-09 20:03:51,"I am frustrated with the current situation in this country. Looking around, we are living in a country where even treatment drug is politicized. To put off this pandematic when there is vaccine avaliable, we need whole society comply with social distincing. Unfortunately, we fail. There is other country as bad as we are. 

I have been confined myself in my house for two and half months, I cannot see where is the loght. Maybe I will be affected anyway, what the point to restrict myself."
2020-06-09 20:49:59,"""Governments around the world have recommended face masks and social-distancing measures because of the risk of asymptomatic transmission.""

There is a confusion about ""asymptomatic transmission"" in this article. If a person was an asymptomatic carrier of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it means he/she would never show COVID-19 symptoms. A number of studied have reported that the risk of virus transmission from this type of carriers is low or very low.

However, a COVID-19 patient can be asymptomatic for the first 2-14 days after being infected, and the person can transmit the virus to many others during this asymptomatic period. Wearing mask can significantly reduce the risk of virus transmission to others. And in this case, the person is not  an asymptomatic carrier by definition.

In short, wearing mask is very important, no matter the W.H.O recommendation is valid or not."
2020-06-09 19:49:56,Let me know when you guys decide if transmission from asymptomatic persons or surfaces is something we should take seriously.

Our state has taken small steps in reopening.  Our Governor has been most heartedly berated by Republicans and sued by some business people for her very cautious steps.   Granted cases are going down.  But hot spots in the prisons, reservations, and meat packing plants are still problematic.   My grandmother lived through the Spanish flu.  Lye soap, vinegar soaked masks, prayers and vigilance helped her to survive.  There are no easy solutions but I see a long road ahead for our country.  What will be worse is that if we do not learn from the tragic mistakes that have been made."

2020-06-09 19:18:05,"I am very disappointed in this latest irresponsible statement from WHO. I wonder how many more are being infected by this latest gaff from them. If they are to be a respected international voice of healthcare, act like it. Speak responsibly or keep silent."

2020-06-09 21:16:20,"Dr Fauci’s comments are chilling but also a huge bellwether for the next 6-24 maybe 36 months. As individuals and communities we must adapt or fall ill and all that means with this virus. I am mostly home bound due layers of high risk issues that stack up to a potential awful experience not to mention death by suffocation or all the other treats that survivors and victims share. I will gladly be inconvenienced for however long necessary. I am humbled by the consideration shown me by my family and friends. I can’t see my grands ages 1-4. Ew, that hurts. 
My compassion for all with young children, tweens, teens, and young adults who have had their schooling and fun wacked  across the field. Adapt as best as possible.

The WHO is essential for dealing with this pandemic, and needs sharply increased financial support from the US and other countries."
2020-06-09 21:56:26,"Sir, let us emphasize the mere facts:
This nightmare was to be expected, and  might have been stopped by timely measures, as the Chinese did.
It is stopped by testing suspects, by isolation and efficient health care for the diseased, by quarantine of the contacts and by lockdown of the factories, schools and universities, by stopping cultural, sport and religious mass events.
We knew and know, all these regulations are unpopular but effective.
Because of distrust and disregard of the Chinese's experiences time was los. In Germany, the open border dogma, supported by the WHO, hindered to quarantine incoming flight passengers from China and we gave priority for business and tourist connections to China over the health agenda.
Some social Darwinists even wellcomed the epidemia, declared, its like a common cold or influenza, so the old could succumbe, with benefits for the young, who got rid of them.
In the US precious time was lost arguing about the facts and the consequences, the scenario of waiting and disregarding the development of the pandemia resulted in unprepared offices, doctors, homes for the aged and hospitals, in insufficient PPE. There are deficiencies of the health care system, especially in regards to the underprivileged, the unemployed and old.
Lacking a valid treatment of covid 19, now all hope and effort is for a secure prophylaxis by vaccination, better and safer than the dengue vaccine, to get us out of this misery."

They are considered to be essential workers, as indeed they are! All low-paid essential workers should be able to obtain their required tests without charge. Our federal government must put their heads together and figure out make COVID-19 tests free for all essential workers."
2020-06-09 23:26:04,"In some ways, the debate is over, and ""re-opening"" won. It's simply not politically feasible for a governor, or a president for that matter, to call for a lockdown. Think about the howls that people let out before we all started reading from a script about the alleged police state. Can you imagine the chaos if a governor announced that the police and military were going to enforce, say, curfews?

The Dr Phils and the Rush Limbaughs were saying early on that we should just treat this like it's the flu (or in Phil's case, like swimming pool accidents), and kinda get used to all the deaths and packed hospitals. They never had science on their side, but in the end, society has thrown its hat in with them: the next year or so will be an experiment to see how well we can factor in C-19 deaths and disruption into our daily lives. Just like we do with the flu. 

When's the last time that people got alerts to their phone about the body count from traffic accidents?"
2020-06-09 23:31:34,"This sobering news of a widening global scale of contagion is lost to the headlines of the day.

The legitimate worldwide protests arising from the murder of George Floyd had the immediate effect of dominating the news headlines for the past couple of weeks.  And many people, short of attention spans as we are, lost interest in the pandemic as it dropped from the front page.

Similarly, NY is a worldwide media center.  As news of its success in reducing the contagion and consequent commencement of a phased reopening developed much of America equated that with the situation in other parts of the US.  This despite the fact that contagion rates are increasing in many states -- states that perhaps locked down too soon and are now ""reopening"" prematurely?

As Dr. Fauci indicates, we remain in the grips of a raging pandemic that continues to spread rapidly and widely.  It appears that Americans are ""exhausted"" by all this news and just want to return to ""normal"".  But the virus does not share our short attention span.  It is indefatigable and will continue to rage havoc among us.  A havoc that will be all the more devastating as we humans now let our guards down and continue to think this contagion is a matter of political debate rather than one of public health."

2020-06-10 01:02:55,"Americans continue to buy into the myth that we are destined to conquer all that stand in our way.  The fact is, we either learn to live with this virus by adapting to new ways of living or perish.  

The days of care free living, where we can go through life and take everything for granted has come to an end.   While there have been significant advances in modern medicine, the fact is, it has limitations.  Perhaps the secret of surviving in the post pandemic world is recognize that we already know what we need to know.  The question is, will we adapt and evolve in our thinking about how to coexist in nature with other life forms?"
2020-06-09 22:37:22,"The original statement of Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, individuals testing positive for the virus SARS-CoV-2 but are asymptomatic are not infectious, even if true, is not the statement to send to the entire world.  The nuances of asymptomatic and presymptomatic are lost on people and the statement is a conclusion not a preventative operational guideline.  We do not know when someone who ultimately is symptomatic becomes infectious.  Is there a phase where someone is not yet showing any symptoms of Covid-19 and still can transmit the virus.  That is a challenging question to answer.  

We need operational rules of conduct in this pandemic.  Start with rules that are more than what you think are needed and then adjust them as supportive evidence is found that justifies scaling them back with no bad consequences.

When he should have done more listening and less talking, Dr. Fauci did more talking and less reading of scientific lit. 

Another blunder in the response led by Dr. Fauci was underestimating the lack of preparedness in densely populated cities of USA including International city, NY, his birthplace, which became the epicenter of the worst pandemic in USA in this century. It should not have taken a genius Epidemiologist to realize that mainly adults above 55 were the vulnerable population that absolutely needed to be kept out of the line of fire of COVID-19 infections, not everyone. Many of those who ended up dying in nursing homes or receiving home care were bed ridden and never going to get up from their beds and walk out. The best strategy for them would have been to ensure they were breathing outside air directly instead of from central air supply. The other insight that one could have understood from the data trickling in from China was that COVID-19 infections were CURABLE in adults below 55 and 1% fatality in this group in persons with subnormal immune system could have been expected, without shutting businesses."

Here's who weren't surprised. Taiwan which started screening passengers from Wuhan before any of them could deplane, this on 12/31/19 when WHO reported some unusual pneumonias in Wuhan. Taiwan's VP, a respected epidemiologist and virologist, activated their pandemic response team in early January. Angela Merkel and her scientists who early on developed testing and contact tracing protocols. Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara, Ca public health director who saw the exponential growth of cases in Europe and called for the first lockdown in the US. The Washington state departments of public health and hospitals who were ready and waiting, with their pandemic protocol, for their first covid patient.

On a national level, no one or department has yet taken effective action to control the virus. Until this happens, our only defense is to continue to hide in our houses. This is  tough on all of us and on all businesses.

What we need to safely open up are protocols for intelligently testing (e.g. with sampling strategies) persons with and without symptoms to identify hot spots early on and effective contact tracing to limit transmission of cases before they can grow again into those exponential curves. Other nations had these tools in place months ago; we are still struggling."

If there is a serious risk,
why is Dr. Fauci not speaking up about that?

If there is no serious risk,
then why not?

Because they are outdoors?

Because nearly all the protesters are supposedly wearing masks?

If Dr. Fauci believes, as a scientist,
that outdoors and masks are sufficient to stop serious risk of spread of COVID 19,
then why did not Dr. Fauci tell us that -- loud and clear --
three months ago?

If that is the case,
there are many, many activities where Americans would gladly like to congregate --
and would have gladly liked to congregate during the past three months --
outdoors and wearing masks --
such as picnics,
beaches and parks,
outdoor sports events,
outdoor entertainment venues,
etc.

Or is Dr. Fauci one of the so-called ""scientists""
who are now making the political (i.e. non-scientific)
judgment that America needs ""social justice"",
and that congregating to ""protest"" to get social justice
justifies the serious risk of spread of COVID 19?"
2020-06-09 22:13:21,"This whole thing from the WHO, the CDC, Fauci, Brix, etc. has once again proven the adage that even the experts can get it wrong and give really bad advice.  Fauci said in late January that the coronavirus was not something that should worry Americans.  And it wasn’t until mid-April that the CDC, NIH experts said we should all be wearing masks after telling us that wearing masks did not make a difference in transmission.

The fact is that Fauci did not know whether or not coronavirus posed a pandemic threat, so he should have said so.  The same was true of wearing masks, they should have never said that everyone wearing masks will not make a difference in rates of transmission, instead of saying that they did not know if it would make a difference.  They are killing their credibility, and that is killing us.  Stop it.  If you don’t know, then say you don’t know.

One more thing about the train wreck at the WHO.  They keep saying that there is no evidence that having recovered from coronavirus that there is any immunity.  Completely wrong.  There are now well over a million documented cases of covid recoveries worldwide, so by now we should also have many thousands of documented re-infections.  Well, where are they?  By now any expert that says there is no evidence that having recovered from coronavirus provides any immunity needs to not be called an expert."

Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx have been warning Americans for weeks now to wear masks when in public, [gloves and protective eyewear (safety glasses) in conjunction would make you even safer] yet too many still think they are either immune, or the pandemic is overblown, or the threat is over. Nothing could be further from the truth. Covid19 doesn't care about politics, party affiliation, or indifference. No one is immune. 7 million people and counting have been infected, and more than 400,000 deaths have occurred. And some who have survived the ravages of covid19 find themselves in need of ongoing physical therapies to cope with lingering debilities: lung damage, memory loss, muscle atrophy and weakness, stroke damage. (Read the first hand stories being published.)

Manufacturing of critical PPE must return to the US. We also need a flood of public service announcements telling Americans how to stay safe, how to disinfect home and work environments, and start fining people who don't comply.

Stay the blazes home!  Wash your hands!  Go out only if you have to!  It’s that simple.

It is hard to determine whether they help or not, because we cannot really use epidemiologic data, as the use of masks is always accompanied by other, much more effective measures. Therefore the above statement is dangerously false."

""As in 1940"" Germany ""came out ahead""? 
Obviously, France fell to the Nazis in 1940, that's historical fact. But France didn't fall to ""Germany"", the modern German government didn't then exist. It fell to Nazi occupation. 

(Not to mention, ""historically,"" France's ""rival"" was not Germany, it was Great Britain.)

To me, wording and tone are so cavalier it sounds like comparing years one outdid the other in football. Insinuating France was ""bested"" by Germany now like Germany ""came out ahead"" of France in 1940 makes it seem like the strategy and philosophy behind the Nazis is the same reason the Germans ""beat"" France at the death toll.

And now, I shall promptly forget about him again.

I am not a doctor either, but my spouse is. I have been hearing from her firsthand about how bad this virus is, and she is not one who exaggerates or believes information presented to her without thoroughly checking it. She has firsthand experience from working for the past several months, participating in hundreds of video calls with other physicians in the Bay Area and across the country. The only reason that the Bay Area was not hit as badly as some other populated areas is because we locked down earlier than others.  

We are learning more about the virus every day, and that data is out there. One significant example is the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, which tracks worldwide cases of COVID-19 with respect to diagnosis, recovery, mortality rate, etc: <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"" target=""_blank"">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</a>.

Once a legitimate research scientist, she became disenfranchised with the scientific community when her paper, originally published in Journal Science, was later withdrawn when her findings couldn’t be duplicated. She stuck to her guns about her theory,  then got into legal trouble for taking (aka stealing) data from the lab she worked for. She went underground, and at this point her main audience became the woo woos and conspiracy freaks who always seem to question the dominant paradigm, in this case reality. There she found a following. Its amazing to me how many intelligent people a;ways seem to need to look deeper - they can’t accept the fact that viruses exist, and emerge periodically- always have. They can’t accept that while a tiny minority of people have been hurt by vaccines, the vast majority have been helped by them. They have to blame an evil genius who wants to control the world and make scads of $$, even though their already one of the rich. Connecting the dots, even when they’re not there, is one of their favorite pastimes. Things are never how they seem to be - we are always being lied to - That kind of thing.

No, what is abundantly clear is simply that you don’t know anything. People like you are always making the generalization that everyone else must be as dimwitted as you are, and that just isn’t true.

Plandemic? Do we really need to know how stupid people can be? I guess so. Do we need to know this about Seal? Perhaps, but we dont need that information presented this way. 

Why not just put up an article about how ignorant the whole concept behind Plandemic is and why we keep subjecting ourselves to this kind of ignorance and what we might do about it, rather than write equally stupid titles to articles which, when glossed over, give weight to nonsense by associating it with people that might otherwise seem sane and popular."

The deaths themselves meant nothing to him.

What matters to him is the stock market because the continuation of his Presidency now depends almost entirely upon it.

When Trump rode down the escalator, businesses and many well-to-do people saw a con-artist who would give them lower taxes; was promising to spend lavishly on the military and the infrastructure; had no interest in controlling budget deficits and inflation; would cast a cold eye on the need for health and safety measures in the workplace; and would ignore the effects of climate change.

Well, the chickens have now come home to roost; and what he and Americans foolish enough to believe in his methods succeeded in producing were vastly overheated stock prices that 
-- to the surprise of no one familiar with the ups and downs of the stock market -- collapsed.

2020-06-08 13:45:07,"I remember news articles in the 1980s about the disparity between the US and Japan in regard to executive pay compared to average worker pay. 

Japan, partly because it was a society where every worker was seen as essential and deserving of respect, had executive pay that was more in line with average worker pay, with the top execs making maybe 10 times the pay of workers. 

The US, of course, had execs making well over 100 times the pay of workers. Back in the 1980s we knew about this, but the problem in the US has only gotten worse.

Now we actually have execs who run corporations into the ground in order to create short term profits for stockholders and pay themselves millions.

Why can’t we have laws that corporations who do business in the US must have sound business practices and limits on exec pay? 

If we can enforce a national minimum wage (which should be much higher than $15/hour with appropriate tax considerations for truly small businesses), we should be able to also fix things at the top.

This, along with every corporation and individual paying their fair share of taxes would go a long way toward economic justice and equality."

And no exec making over $300,000 in all forms of funds/stocks etc should receive any salary that year.This should be true for airlines as well. In Philadelphia, hospitals have food banks where you can drop off canned goods for hospital workers.

Germany’s federal government and mainstream media are engaged in damage control after a report that challenges the established Corona narrative leaked from the interior ministry.

Some of the report key passages are:

1.   The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.

2.  The people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).

3.  Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.

4.  The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.

5.  A reproach could go along these lines: During the Corona crisis, the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.

The hundred of thousands of courageous people who hit the streets the last 13 days to demand justice reform showed it can be done.  Most wore masks and used as much social distancing as possible.  They must now get tested and self-quarantine to help stop the spread.

Do they want me to go out of business?

As far as I'm concerned, the lockdowns ended with the George Floyd protests. It was a complete about-face regarding coronavirus risk that a lot of liberals have conveniently ignored. Some authorities are more terrified of getting criticized by BLM than of being even-handed with the lockdown, so I'm glad it's finally ending.

Until we get a vaccine I would hope NYC would encourage those who can afford to drive to do so so that there is less risk of infecting those who can't afford to drive.

I understand that people need to work and businesses need to open. I just hope we're smart about it, otherwise people will have gone to work and opened their businesses only to die because of it. How does that help anyone?

If we could stop acting as though we're always reinventing the wheel, and instead watch how successful countries manage, we could probably find a way through this with fewer deaths, and less impact than if we just all stayed home for six more months. A phased approach seemed like a good idea, but as the numbers of infected and dead go up, we're moving further into ""re-opening.""

This past weekend, my husband and I drove to Wisconsin. We stopped at one of the well kept and beautiful tourist stations. There were a ton of cars in the parking lot, all with WI plates. Only my husband and I wore face masks. 

As I approached the front door of the tourist station, I got a dirty look from an approaching couple who were my age.  Just before the woman passed me, she coughed directly into my face and then kept walking. She & her husband laughed as they walked to their car & drove off. 

Never in my life was I more relieved to have worn the N95 mask I kept when we redid our basement. 

Every employee of the shops/stores we visited wore face masks, but not a single customer did. We kept getting dirty looks from people all day. We could not wait to get out of WI. 

I will not be shocked if a huge resurgence of the virus returns to that state because so dang many people had total disregard for ANY safety precautions.

That means the W.H.O. is more concerned with politics over pandemics. There is simply no honest way around that conclusion. W.H.O. should tell everyone to go home."
2020-06-08 20:39:39,Believe it's getting worse in this country too. The suppressing of the death count is the only plan the President and a number of  Governors  aren't even hiding to pursue. It'll be up to the various local news and newspapers to diligently keep track and keep us informed as to the actual danger still in play here.
2020-06-08 20:49:57,More testing will show more cases. Are cases increasing or being exposed?
2020-06-08 20:50:24,"Instead of closing down streets so buses (not exactly an epitome of social distancing) can flow, how about within manhattan at least closing down certain streets purely for pedestrians.  You get twofold benefit in a little exercise plus wider areas for human traffic to move through."
2020-06-08 20:21:06,It’s the American way.
2020-06-08 20:39:49,"W.H.O? CDC? Haha, the social contract was broken when everyone realized science shaming those we don't believe in became blatantly hypocritical."
2020-06-08 21:04:19,"The protests appear to have changed things for the worst. I would like to see more details about the effects on various American cities and states. 

The logistics for the upcoming election in November becomes more tenuous as we deal with these various challenges.

The protests were VERY necessary but staying protected was and is too.

Be careful America, be careful!"
2020-06-08 21:20:06,"How much have business owners and their employees lost lost, due  to COVID? How many are unemployed? 

Why not motivate individuals to get tested and give them basic financial compensation for the usual 10-14  days of quarantine .... so they don’t feel  forced to work while sick). Track every contact possible Thar might be  enough to lower cases and build consumer confidence, 

And it’s do-able, if citizens can be convinced and have financial motivation. . And if , by luck, those who recover build immunity then it seems a small price to pay, compared to the alternatives: people, afraid to leave home, seniors  cut off from their children and grandchildren, restaurants deserted , etc."
2020-06-08 21:27:49,"As the so called democracies are burdened with populist types of presidents, the Covid-19 pandemic continues on and on. Brazil is a world disgrace and Bolsonaro should be referred to the World Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Others are in the same category. Trump has taken America into an unfamiliar place-a country with the most cases and with the worst responses. Now, others are vying for that place-Russia, Brazil, India, but just look at their leaders. This novel coronavirus has revealed much about preparedness of countries for pandemics-and America has become a text book case for failures of public health and for letting politicians run the response. 

The pandemic is still running rampant around the world, including in US. There have been some real world class responses by countries and by provinces. New Zealand and British Columbia, Canada  mounted responses which see both these areas almost free of new cases. These are not mysteries but real epidemiological science applied results and now persons living there can be happy for their beliefs in science. 

We do not know where or when this pandemic will abate-nor do we know if we always will be mindful of it's presence. One thing we can know for sure is that many countries did not have the political nor ideological will to take effective measures within well know epidemiological historical experiences.  The question I would propose is : what will happen in the next pandemic."
2020-06-08 22:05:01,"Let's get real, the W.H.O. has bungled this from the beginning with inconsistent information.  Trump only made it worse.  The question is not is it worsening-- it's if our hospitals can handle extreme cases.  The solution to containing the virus can't be self isolation until there is a vaccine.  This would only work if it was a national effort and if the public would be subsidized for the loss in both jobs, hours, and furloughs.  The outbreak is going to ""worsen"" in the U.S. for sure as more people get tested.  However, an increase in cases doesn't mean our hospitals have to become overburdened or will become overburdened.  If it starts to go the way of overburdening hospitals, then close back down.  If that's not happening, we have to open back up smartly.  If you are lucky enough to work from home, then you can stay home until January 201 when there might be a vaccine."
2020-06-08 20:55:44,"This is the same WHO that we’ve accused of being subverted by the Chinese, cut funding to and announced that we’re withdrawing from.

Sorry, America today only does science fiction, not actual science."
2020-06-08 20:59:39,"When will people figure out we are not stronger than a virus? It's sad but true. Unless there is an effective vaccine, we are at the mercy of the virus and its spread. All we can try to do is mitigate our risk. If people aren't willing to do that by wearing masks, social distancing, staying home as much as possible, etc., then we will see the horrifying results."
2020-06-08 20:47:28,Could we start to track virus cases and deaths by states who voted for Trump and those that did not?  Would help with directing sympathy to the latter.

Obviously, hospitals need directors and administrators, but they sure as heck don't need millionaire CEOs in order to achieve their missions. This country is sick in so many ways!"
2020-06-08 21:18:10,The WHO should have recommended everyone wearing masks like 90% of the protesters were doing. Thanks for nothing WHO.

2020-06-08 22:21:46,"WHO has fallen prey to its bureaucratic jargon. They completely mishandled the China's  cover-up and failed heroically in containing its fallout later! I wish they acted as aggressively as they did during SARS and the world  would not be today reeling under this double whammy of Covid-19 and Financial crises , complicated by Trump administrations withdrawal from taking a  leadership role in any world affairs  forget about WHO.

Maybe Jared and Ivanka, Trump, Mnuchin and other 1% are doing great financially at the expense of everyone else.

Has Kushner's shadow Pandemic volunteer team replaced the CDC?"
2020-06-08 22:14:41,YES! Have great big rallies with lots of chanting! What could go wrong?
2020-06-08 22:20:44,"Trump has instructed campaign aides to arrange for him to resume large political rallies in the coming weeks.
Wouldn't it be instructive if Trump help a large political rally and nobody came?  Trump has been bad for his supporters mental health for years.  Now he's even worse for their physical health considering he wants to pack them in like sardines so he can really bask in their adulation."
2020-06-08 22:08:36,"Trump should start his yuuuge rallies, asap.  No masks, none of that liberal’s social distancing stuff, nothing.  And shake hands, lots of hands.  Spread the rallies all across Northern Florida, into Georgia and Alabama, then up the Mississippi all the way to Wisconsin.  Take a couple of weeks.

Show that you are a real man."
2020-06-08 22:37:19,"Is it just me, or does it seem to you also that wherever a country is run by a populist and autocratic or leaning autocratic leader, that country appears worse off with respect to Corona virus than countries where the leader is more centrist?

What has been done in Brazil trying to hide data that runs contrary to the official ""party"" line concerns me, because I believe that in certain areas of the US, that has also been the case. Very low Covid-19 mortality rates in those areas, in conjunction with an unexplained, unusual jump in all other mortality rates combined. Really?"
2020-06-08 23:10:25,"The only winner in the current pandemic is the coronavirus.  Unfortunately, not enough people are taking it serious and a rough estimate is only about 25 percent of people are actually wearing masks.   Based on the attitudes of many average citizens, as well Trump and his supporters, the death toll will reach 200 thousands plus dead Americans before election day.  
Also, assuming Trump will soon restart his several hours ""of hate rallies"" (see 1984, G.Orwell), infections and deaths can only be expected to accelerate 

The increasing number of infections and deaths associated with community spread, as well as meat packing plants and prisons in southern and mid-western states probably means sad times ahead in these areas. And, of course, the nationwide protests will add to the numbers.

To make matters worse, the United States is not any better prepared for the next emergency than we have been for the last three.  Soon, we can expect a continuing climate crisis that will make destruction and death from the pandemic appear like a walk in a park."
2020-06-08 22:58:12,"I really missed his rallies, life is not normal until return of these rallies."
2020-06-08 22:38:13,"So Trump will push to hold rallies but the only states that will allow them will be red states with republican governors.  The rally will undoubtedly spread virus and also undoubtedly some who attended will die.  Trump will decrease his number of likely voters over and above what's expected due to normal population death rates. 

Sounds like a winning plan because this is all about his ego and not about anyone actually at the rally."
2020-06-08 22:40:24,"I have absolutely no problem with Trump and his team organizing in-person campaign rallies with the MAGA crowd.

The more the merrier and, of course, everyone knows that real MAGA men never wear masks!

Rally on folks like its you last!"
2020-06-08 22:49:51,"Looking forward to Trump campaign rallies. Either nobody shows up and he looks looked a loser, or MAGAmaniacs show up in droves and nature takes its course.  Win-win.  Choices have consequences."

ALL of US lost, except for the personally unaccountableS. 
Of which there are all too many?"
2020-06-08 23:09:35,What is the difference between campaign rallies and protestors when it come to covid19.  Same thing.  Why allow one and not the other?
2020-06-08 22:41:05,"Let’s keep protesting, seems like a good idea in a pandemic, the numbers are going to be pouring in the next week to two weeks. Then individuals will realize the damage they have done, I take that back they probably won’t. They = black and whites, all protesters. What a waste of time lockdown just became."
2020-06-08 23:15:13,"Yes, well, this is ridiculous at this point.
You want to gather thousands of people together to protest? No problem.
You want to do something else - no, you can’t! Virus is out there."
2020-06-08 23:14:42,It would seem that Trump is doing his best to kill off as many of his supporters as possible. Perhaps so he can blame his upcoming electoral loss on the Coronavirus? Bizarre...
2020-06-08 23:15:57,I have never made so much money working my high-paying white-collar job from my living room while millions of unemployed Trumpers crawl back to work in the unsafe covid-infested factory jobs. Hopefully Trump and Faux News will convince them to vote Republican and make them believe everything is safe so they continue working to make my stock portfolio go up and provide me with good steak.
2020-06-08 23:10:00,"And we lead the pack. I’ve been saying the obvious for weeks - watching my fellow Marylanders leap over government shut gates to our C & O National park in mask-less droves, laughing, as if it were any other summer’s day and they’d suffered enough inconvenience. 

My heart sank. Again. Endless abysses. 

It drives home the fact that has dogged me for these three sad years -our uniquely American talent fod flouting every truth, scientific or legal, may the “fittest” survive. 

The real problem issue in the end, is more economic than racial, though we know the real hardships are always carried by the minority class, especially African Americans. 

But this new citizenry, of every stripe, is indifferent the suffering of our fellow citizens, gleefully parading a brazen stupidity and/or cruelty and a disgraceful indifference to the growing loss of American lives nor the collapse of our way of life.  

We have four months to tap our way into agreement as to how we are to recover a viable, trustworthy  election with a zoo of madmen hanging from every vine in Washington’s GOP. 

We’ve seen a tiny Republican cadre finally see the bloodletting to come who have now stood with their newborn “principles” long enough to redress Trump in his final macabre act. Conducting his mind-boggling bedlam, in a sweat of psychotic paranoia unleashed as strongmen with a straight jacket approach him from the wings, and suddenly, his enablers can smell the burning corpse of their electoral hopes. Finally"
2020-06-08 22:52:03,"It might help if the NYT put even one story about the pandemic versus the protests and their aftermath above the fold, if not to make us realize that the pandemic is getting worse, then just to help us remember that the pandemic is still happening."
2020-06-08 22:46:48,"Yes, please Trump, go ahead with the full house rallies, no masks or social distancing for your base or yourself or any members of your administration or family!"
2020-06-08 22:38:32,"Wait for it.
Should it happen that the death toll in Brazil exceeds that of the USA, look for wild claims of “extraordinary achievement” by Trump of the “Trump administration.” 
The celebratory bragging by DJT will most likely get real, real thick. 
This victory may put Trump in a state even more irrational than when he told the nation that he’d “fixed Korea.”
Stay tuned."
2020-06-08 23:28:11,"Let's see if I have this correct. The president informs  his staff today he wants more large rallies. And soon! Concurrently, the W.H,O. informs us today the pandemic is worsening. I see a problem developing here. Does anyone else? 

So I guess the  Americans for Trump have a difficult choice to make now. Do they endanger their lives to show their support for their leader knowing if they get sick, no one may be able to take care of the kids and unexpected hospital bills could stretch the budget at a time when budgets are already stretched?  

Or do they just stay home? Maybe time to phone a friend...."
2020-06-08 23:32:43,"Sure, President Trump, hold your rallies.  You might lose some supporters (literally), but all for the cause, right?  Anyway, you get daily testing, they don't, so what do you care?

Maybe these rallies will knock some sense into Maga-heads, or at the very least, see how selfish their man is.

As for the WHO casually dropping news that few cases are spread by asymptomatic, well, Dr. Jha is right to be upset.  I hope and his colleagues demand to examine the data, or we'll be in for more zigzagging on policy."
2020-06-08 23:24:07,"NYT quoted Trump’s campaign manager,  “Americans are ready to get back to action, and so is President Trump.” Hasn’t Brad Parscale noticed that Americans have been back in action protesting hatred, discrimination and injustice? If the only action that he and Trump’s campaign care about are rallies, they have on blinders and seemingly do not care about the reasons for the public action of the last two weeks."
2020-06-08 23:55:44,"The only issue that matters today is new hospitalizations. If people with no symptoms test positive, or with minor symptoms don't don't require hospitalization test positive, it's actually not a bad thing. It's called herd mentality.

Could someone please provide a chart of daily hospitalizations in the US. I think we would all be surprised to see the line going down and down."
2020-06-08 23:57:22,Trump wanting rallies is bad. But thousands of protesters in dozens of cities standing shoulder to shoulder is just fine. Really?
2020-06-09 00:02:26,"I am not buying into any dialogue that says a mask is ineffective.  Maybe outdoors in the wide open spaces a mask is a waste.  But in crowded areas, such as stores, shops, public transportation (even if restricted to 1/3 or 1/2 capacity) or shoulder to shoulder on a sidewalk, they should be mandatory if not then strongly encouraged. Bars and restaurants can seat folks at alternating tables.  Business owners should be given the same latitude on masks as they have regarding shoes!  But one thing is certain, we, the USA or the world for that matter does not need another shutdown."
2020-06-08 23:59:20,Used to respect and listen to the WHO.Not anymore.The WHO is more inaccurate than a weather forecaster.
2020-06-08 23:40:36,"America will fail if we don't listen to the facts.   The facts are are that social distancing, masks, widespread tests, contract tracing, quarantine of contacts, are the only way to stop Covid.  Americans have been told their opinion matters so often that they think they are experts, and that somehow they can make up an opinion not based on any real knowledge or evidence, and it is somehow completely valid because they came up with it.  I think many of these folks don't know what they are talking about, but talk they do!  Maybe we should not encourage them by conducting endless opinion polls. We should reserve the airtime for the experts."
2020-06-08 23:44:46,Has anyone noticed that the US may already be several weeks into the beginning of a second wave of COVID-19?  Starting in late May average daily cases seem to have started rising again.
2020-06-08 23:51:26,"And the US is doing its part.  The lates from the Fes is that due to the protests, they are expecting 3,000 new Covid 19 cases per day of the protests.  Thats between 33,000 and 36,000 new cases.  At this point, 7 percent of Covid 19 cases die.  That means that the protestors violation of the lockdown orders and social distancing rules are responsible for an additional 2,300 to 2,500 deaths due to the actions of the protestors during a pandemic."
2020-06-08 23:46:38,"Of course Trump parted ways with the W.H.O.
They were getting in the way of his re-election."
2020-06-08 23:20:35,"Pres. Trump was wearing a mask recently at a mask factory and he was upset that the press captured a photo of him donning a face mask.  Is our President that vain?  He is sending the message to Americans that if you are a fake tough guy, like him you don't need a mask.  Our phony tough President's days are numbered.  This country and the world will throw a world party like that one at the end of Phantom Menace."
2020-06-09 00:07:20,"Mr. Trump’s obsession is with himself. He doesn't need to rile up his base he already has done that with his tweets, some of his base are looting stores and trying to run over protectors. But on the other hand if they are allowed to sit check to check at one his ""rallies"" they just may learn the indiscriminate nature of the virus."
2020-06-09 00:07:52,"Wow.  What a misstatement of facts.  The number of ""cases"" is actually the number of positive tests.  And the number of tests being given is growing exponentially around the globe.  So, the number of positive tests will be growing as well, even though the number of new people infected may actually be decreasing.  Defund police should be defund WHO."
2020-06-09 00:13:43,"NC Governor Roy Cooper requiring RNC attendees in Charlotte to follow mask and distancing guidelines is dutifully looking after his fellow North Carolinian's health and safety. Of course, as with all things, Trump takes it personally. We wish the president and the RNC well in their search for a new location for their convention."
2020-06-09 00:14:10,If we see the second wave in the U.S. we can blame all the blue state governors and Mayors who decided that politics were more important than public safety.

2020-06-09 01:07:44,The most important metric is the number of hospitalizations and deaths. Have those numbers increased? Epidemiologists still say that 80% of the people who get COVID-19 will have mild-to-moderate symptoms. Has the number of people hospitalized and dying in the remaining 20% gone up as well?
2020-06-09 01:02:04,"I can tell you Republican leaders (including Gov. Kemp) are completely out of touch with reality if they think Atlanta will be a good setting for their convention.

They'd be better off finding a nice big cornfield somewhere."
2020-06-09 01:12:36,"Arizona is one of the states that opened too early. We also have a lot of people who aren’t wearing masks anymore. Hence, why we are experiencing a spike in cases the last two weeks.  

Wear a mask!"
2020-06-09 01:12:43,"""Trump wants to restart large campaign rallies within weeks.""

We have witnessed tens of thousands of avoidable Covid-19 deaths, thanks to Mr. Trump's dithering, fumbling and hindrance. I find it hard to believe that the members of his personality cult who attend these rallies will follow the recommended social isolation policies. Consequently, attendees will needlessly die. Doctors and nurses who must care for these rally goers will needlessly die. Innocent people who do not attend the rallies will needlessly die. Should these rallies be held, thousands will needlessly die, in the name of his re-election."
2020-06-09 01:12:00,"We need to pay attention to Medical issues and not make political issues out of it.

2020-06-09 01:53:21,It is expected that the mass protests will lead to a spike in new COVID-19 cases.  Trump's rallies will pale in comparison.
2020-06-09 02:10:32,"The W.H.O. surrendered its legitimacy some time ago as it fully revealed that its mission has nothing to do with ""health.""  Its manipulation of data, scientific fraud and hyper-partisan co-option combine to cast it as a fully infiltrated ideological bureaucracy.  This report and forecast mean nothing."
2020-06-09 02:40:49,"We all know that until there is a vaccine available under good manufacturing practices (GMP) on a very large scale, the numbers of COVID-19 cases will be rising. What does the world Health Organization (WHO) recommend now that we have 6 months of data and models that work and ones that don't work and create more deaths due to other causes. 

There are no perfect models but I think Iceland, Japan and Sweden got it right. As my father was told by his father when he was sent out to kill a vicious snake with a stick. ""Kill the snake but don't break the stick"" Well most lock downs neither saved lives nor did they keep their economy humming and  ended up neglecting patient care for non COVID-19 causes and immunization of children. 

WHO botched the COVID-19 pandemic and is now telling US that death is inevitable. We are aware of that and longevity is about avoiding death. There 100s of ways a person could die and COVID-19 is just one of them. our existence cannot be COVID centric. We have to move on without fearing death but steering clear of it by all means possible without choking livelihoods or lives."

2020-06-09 02:55:58,"I did not hear any stinging complaints over the last 2 weeks over those massive rallies blm rallies where so many came into close contact ignoring social distancing, physical contact and even many did not don face masks.

Now that President Trump wants to hold, there is, as usual, fierce criticism directed towards Him.

How many lives may have been saved had he not downplayed this crisis from the onset.   Where is social distancing and where are the masks.

A family of 4 size roast of beef should not cost $40 or a steak $17. 
Heck you might say living in a city or large town costs more but when I lived in the bay area food was cheaper and better quality than anywhere else I ever lived rural or city.

The aid that's gone to ""farmers"" recently, and even not-so-recently, has gone to agribusiness, not people who actually farm. It's often just some capitalist in NY City or even another country who's never set foot on a farm.

This is not, and has not been, for a long time, about supporting ""family farms"".

(And even the family farms that have benefitted the most from government subsidies are large farms with farmworkers doing the work.)

And yes, this is about Congress being bought & sold, in this case by ""farm"" lobbies. It's about the GOP and moneyed interests."

And yet Republicans clutch their pearls at the fact that some lower-paid workers, hit hard by business and restaurant closures, may be making more in unemployment than they would have if they'd continued working. That is, if they've even received payments yet from the chaotic and disorganized departments of Labor in their states. Many have already been waiting two and three MONTHS for benefits to arrive, are at the end of their resources, and have no idea when they will receive any relief.

Farmers are important to be sure-- but it's disgusting that Trump can blatantly buy their votes with what is essentially a bribe, and not one farmer seems to have a problem with this brand of socialism."

There was clearly a political message associated with the payments."

I rather doubt the farmers will add up to anywhere close to the numbers in the cities and the suburbs but the ploy is the same. 
Vote blue through and through. Save democracy."
2020-06-08 15:37:59,"These subsidies have been going on for decades.  I can appreciate some need for farm supports, but they have lost all sense of logic, since it's the corporate farms getting all the support.  Given how Trump has politicized everything, including PPE for red states vs. blue states, I have no doubt that there is corruption involved in how the funds are allocated.  

Again, we just have to outnumber his supporters at the polls in November."
2020-06-08 16:06:16,"“Cotton farmers were paid 33 times as much in federal subsidies in 2019 as the income they actually lost to trade disruptions, one study showed.

Some farms collected millions of dollars in payments despite a limit of $250,000 per farmer.”

Only in the Trump Administration would the pandemic and it’s aid be politicized.

I hope the farmers and the conglomerates spend their money wisely because there’s nobody to buy it.

And after the money is spent, we’ll see images on TV of producers pouring milk down the drain and crops being thrown away.

And lines in food banks at enormous levels.

Creating a fleet of vehicles and teams that could process, package, and deliver products would have been a far better use of billions than putting the $ directly into pockets of already wealthy farmers. Such a strategy would have served to benefit food deserts, quarantined populations, and farmers, creating a self-sustaining market circle that could prove useful even after the country figures out its new normal.

So Trump has given bail-outs three times and is prepping to do another and the Department of Agriculture is fine with that, handing out millions to individual farmers even though there is a $250,000 limit?

How odd, given that the Department of Agriculture is also the home for Food Stamps, a hold-over from when recipients were given actual commodities instead of booklets of funny-money or plastic cards.... but no food.

And, how odd, that though Trump can't shovel enough money at these farmers, that he has pushed legislation to dump every hungry person in this country off those rolls.

On April 1, of this year, over 1,000,000 food stamp recipients were to be unceremoniously thrown out with no options. That was stopped only because of the Coronavirus, but we are all sure that that plan  will still happen.

So, when can we expect the court trials of the farmers who took more out of the system than they were legally allowed?

That's what happens when a recipient of food stamps gets more than they are legally allowed, so, when?

The brief unfortunate recent experiment in democracy has turned out the be an interesting, but bothersome exercise for the wealthy and the elite, and it is past time to return the economy to its natural state. The wealthy, the dynastic aristocracies, the economic barons, and the monetary moguls have no further need for the peasant classes.

In fact, this whole idea of individual sovereignty and economic freedom has turned out to be a dangerous rhetorical notion that is giving too many people the entirely wrong idea. People still actually believe they have opportunity, and can achieve their goals and dreams just by ingenuity, hard work, and perseverance. Their disappointment is the stuff of revolutions, so it's best if the ruling classes continue to enrich themselves, and also continue to misinform and divide the lower classes.

Enriched further by subsidies, they characterize helping a poor family as a rampant, dangerous vice called socialism. They convince poor sick people that they are better off without universal health care. They say your brother has taken what you had, not I have taken what you had. They say do not trust your brother. Trust me. I'm rich. What would I have to steal from you for?

   Their pomposity and ineptitude shames us by laying bare the ruins of respected institutions, and the robust economy they inherited.
  
  Farmers do generally have a tough lot in life, but I doubt heavily subsidizing big Agri, and wealthy ""farmers"" who are no gentlemen, will improve their position.

Its the same with their hypocrisy of honoring healthcare workers while they struggle to address their communities and their own needs hampered by staff & budget cuts, inadequate supplies, and a national response weakened by an inept, self serving adminstration.

  It would appear that the  billions given to wealthy supporters in the healthcare industry  if this administration refuses their sworn duty to safeguard the trust given them, provide the response one would expect in a wealthy nation?
 One that addresses the needs of victims, healthcare workers and our communities in a deadly pandemic they enabled?

The contempt shown for the American people, and our Constitution by this administration and their supporters- our own neighbours is so reprehensible, they dishonor  their birthright as citizens."

There are more than enough theories posited about the processes of willful blindness, deafness, indifference, complacency, complicity and collaboration."
2020-06-08 18:16:02,"Well these farmers actually take welfare payments (called subsidies to make it more palatable)  Why should US taxpayers pay farmers to destroy crops when there is overwhelming food insecurity? And in my state, we had one article about a sheep raiser who is going great but generally the beef and sheep raisers are whining about lower production/demand."
2020-06-08 19:13:53,"There should be accountability and oversight in regards to the payments provided.  Any payment made in excess of what would have been a reasonable amount, those funds should be returned to taxpayers.  If farmers can't be profitable running their business, than they shouldn't be farming.  The amount of taxpayers money wasted on farmers is obscene.  They're our biggest welfare recipients."

What Pelosi and Co.  do not initiate cannot be spent. Apparently Pelosi has decided, as usual, to go along in order to get along better with the Republicans and the President.  What is the point of electing Democrats who cannot use ""the power of the purse"" to restrain  regional and sectional partisanship?  The Democratic Party is a junior partner in our national self-destruction."
2020-06-08 14:36:36,"No surprise here.  Republicans think socialism is the enemy until they need it to win.  I'll never understand how Republicans can claim Democrats are socialists while supporting this kind of massive redistribution of wealth.

I am happy that the farmers are not suffering for money under Trumps Presidency - we all rely on them for our survival since many of us don't grow our own food.  However, it pains me that they continue to support the guy because he showers them with money.

I guess I have this idealist view of farmers as people with a love for their land combined with strong a character and deep seeded values.  Turns out they can be bought just like anyone else."
2020-06-08 15:34:24,"So this is how politics maintains constituencies. Just like the author states, “key voting blocs”. I suppose I’m not surprised, since this applies to all voting blocs and happens  in all places were major government stakeholders live, regardless of political affiliation. Buying votes by offering constituents a piece. 

For myself, the saving grace is it goes for those that make our food, which is primary to our survival. If you don’t think so, trying going without. 

I’d like to see more go to small and mid size farmers who often struggle financially. With the issues that recently happened at the large plants, perhaps a less centralized system would be more robust and resilient."
2020-06-08 16:25:30,"I was born and raised on a small farm in Nebraska.  My personal and professional life has required daily connection with farm issues.  I can tell you with great certainty that the vast majority of farm program payments go not to small farmers like my father (who never farmed more than about 200 acres in his life), but to large corporations who, in most cases, do not raise crops directly consumable by humans (i.e. field corn (not the sweet corn you buy at the market), soybeans, and cotton).  I fully support robust crop insurance programs that offset some of the risks inherent in farming.  However, I think it's long past time that government farm support programs focus like a laser on promoting the sustainable production of fruits, vegetables, grains, and other crops that can be directly utilized by human beings, and not the production of monoculture or biculture (i.e. one or two crops) which is turning large swaths of the country into the agricultural equivalent of an industrial wasteland."
2020-06-08 16:54:20,"Farm bankruptcies and farmer suicides are at crisis levels, so it’s a bit hard to stomach the idea that farm country is better off at the end of all this. Demographically, large farm owners are older, wealthier, rural white men who are very likely to be hardcore right-wing Republicans even in bad times and even without the bribe payments from Trump and Sec. Purdue. These payments are more accurately seen as rewards to political supporters (note that they skew heavily to large farms and southern states even though that’s not who was most hurt by the trade war) than as an attempt to shore up “swing” voters. And for what it’s worth, most opinion surveys of “farmers” frequently miss the women in the families who often don’t self-identify as farmers."
2020-06-08 15:52:48,"I grew up in conservative Ohio farm country.  Trump is indeed doing an excellent job bribing our nations farmers (with taxpayer money) to continue to support him. It’s been one of his best loyalty strategies.  Also, in my personal experience, most farmers think just like he does, and pride themselves on being anti-intellectual."
2020-06-08 16:27:04,"The answer is to do away with large scale corporate “farming,” which is actually producing crops and animals on a factory model. 

Not healthy for the humans that consume them, not healthy for the farm workers, and not healthy for the planet.

Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is the answer. Small family owned farms, mostly organic, which serve their communities.

I live in the Bronx and I just joined a CSA so that I can receive vegetables and fruit from a farm in New York State in exchange for a financial share in their small business. 

Some CSAs even work with “Food Stamp” programs, and more would if they were supported by our government.

Locally grown food doesn’t have to be elitist, like some expensive farmers markets. And the food can be delivered to cities as well as small towns.

CSAs are the future of food production in America. They deserve the support of our tax dollars, not agribusiness in which there is no accountability and no relationship with the local community."
2020-06-08 20:34:56,"Conservatives trash big and expensive running of the US Government, but love tax payer money that benefits them. In this case, are the farmers that support President Trump."
2020-06-08 21:22:42,"I received some of these payouts.  There is little paperwork associated with these payments and they just end up in my account.  I can't help but contrast that with another program with the USDA that I attempted to participate in.   Last year I applied for assistance to plant cover crops-an environmentally important practice to prevent erosion, build the soil and to lessen flooding.  Cover crop seed is expensive and the USDA has programs to cover part of the cost of the seed and planting.  It took several phone calls and a long in-person meeting to complete the paperwork.  I then had to follow a rigid plan that did not take into account changing weather and field conditions that changed the cover crop possible from what was on the plan.  To make changes there were several phone calls and new plans were faxed and then I waited for approval.  Due to weather and the need to get the cover crop in the ground I went ahead and planted it and did not receive reimbursement.  I know that they want to prevent fraud and to make sure that the money is used for approved and effective practices.  It takes a lot of energy and time to apply for environmentally beneficial USDA programs, and really, only a few minutes to get the larger farm assistance payments that all farmers receive regardless of their environmental practices. It demonstrates the values in the current USDA administration."

It in no way discredits the major COVID-19 suffering in some places to acknowledge a different reality in others.

About the only thing known for certain about the disease is that we know nothing for certain about how it will evolve. Yes, it is an experiment with human lives, but how the different approaches to dealing with ""reopening"" play out will provide very important information for epidemiologists in trying to forecast the likely future of COVID-19 and ways to minimize its disastrous effects, both medical and economic."
2020-06-06 20:51:22,"Few seem to have considered another obvious possibility: the measures taken (that so many in the article decry) actually worked. It may make sense to reopen more businesses and facilities more quickly in some places, but a culture war refusal to wear masks inside of businesses and other indoor facilities would threaten to undermine the very gains that make it possible to reopen more places. Moreover, some sectors (tourism and restaurants)  and businesses (gyms) may simply not be able to replicate pre-pandemic conditions at this time."

Lots of stats which might have been easily assembled on risk as seen by people (rather than as seen top-down by doctors) are not being assembled so folks like NYT readers can get an informed perception of their risks."

Things won't return to what most people perceive as ""normal"" until there's a vaccine. Even then, it won't be the same. Many businesses will never re-open, and by one estimate 42% of the job losses will be permanent."

Is New York City like rural upstate New York? Is northern Virginia (abutting Washington, DC) like the southern tier of Virginia? Is Atlanta like rural Georgia? The answer, in all case, is NO. Governments in far too many states destroyed peoples lives, trashed jobs, and ruined the economic base of their states due to their over zealous (and politically correct) fixation on their large cities. The latest job rebounds show that those Governors (like George and Florida) were right all along. And - dare I say it? - Trump was, too. We cannot survive with businesses shut down. The consequences are too severe."
2020-06-06 21:29:58,"The authors of this article make a basic logical error. They overlook the likelihood that, if the lockdown had not occurred, all these states and counties that currently have low infection rates would now be overwhelmed by it. People fleeing New York, LA, and other spreader locations would have seeded infections everywhere months ago.
  If a government order had put cockpit door lock protocols in place on September 10th, 2001, I imagine the authors would now be complaining about the unnecessary economic damage to  the airline industry."
2020-06-06 21:46:02,"Should have used the median as a dividing line for who to research and poll.  The average will still be distorted higher because of large outbreaks like New York City's, and the median will be more realistic."
2020-06-06 21:52:35,I live in Palm Beach County Florida. Number of infections are increasing as expected after county commissioners opened before meeting any of the Federal guidelines for opening. Number of cases daily has increased to the peak infection period . Despite that the County Commissioners opened fully except for free standing bars at a meeting that public comment was barred. Clearly in this area dollars Trumps health and life.
2020-06-06 21:55:56,Maybe these people should consider that the reason their infection rate is low is because of the lockdown. Release the lockdown and see what happens. Look at how fast the pandemic took off and people started dying. Caution was warranted. I understand the desire to get going again and feel it myself though I am in a secure job. But people need to to feel safe.
2020-06-06 22:02:10,"It's easy to second guess the decisions made in March.  True, the virus can thrive in the densely populated cities, but it can also spread just as rapidly pithing a densely packed bar or cafe.  I, for one, am glad we erred on the side of caution.  Good businesses will rebound, bad ones will not."
2020-06-06 22:09:43,"I do have a lot of empathy for these areas that have not been affected by the virus but affected by the lockdown.  We don't know if the lockdowns in fact prevented these areas from getting the virus, and I guess time will tell if they get it now that things are reopened.

I do agree, though, the US is a very big and diverse area and we probably should have used a much smarter approach to shutting things down, based on population, testing, amount of disease etc etc.  The problem was and remains that we don't have an adequate infrastructure to figure any of that out nationwide, and it seems that the Federal Government has practically given up on the whole subject!  There is a good possibility that things will ebb and flow and spike and a system in place would allow most places to stay open and only close down where needed.  Thats what we need now and it's still non existent, although many states are trying to figure out a way to do that on their own, and others not so much.
It's extremely frustrating."
2020-06-06 22:12:13,"The initial lockdowns had to be done.  Arguments can be made as to whether they were too long or not.  However, they were needed as the country was caught flat-flooted in regards to healthcare capacity and protective equipment.  It appears that most of the country has caught up on these issues.  Even in NY, NJ,CT, and MA - during the highest surge in hospitalizations, the extra capacity brought on was not used.  The economy and society cannot wait for a vaccine - it is time to open the economy.  People at risk should protect themselves from exposure to the virus.  It's now time for people to take personal responsibility for their health status.  We cannot ask the population of healthy people to stop the progress of their lives and livelihoods."
2020-06-06 22:12:33,"The number of deaths from car accidents has fallen dramatically with seatbelts, safer cars, speed limits and crackdowns on drunk driving... under the logic of these people wishing to reopen, all these measures (some of which add thousands to the cost of every car) should stop because there are not many deaths..."
2020-06-06 22:21:23,"Many rural areas do not have enough ventilators and hospital beds, so relatively low numbers of infections can overwhelm compared to that of cities. Reopening should factor in these statistics, as well as the number of people who are elderly and have higher risk factors for disease (obesity, diabetes, etc). The lockdowns actually came in too late - we now have at least 20,000 cases per day nationwide - and that's really the issue of why reopening is so hard. The virus knows no borders once it's in."
2020-06-06 22:34:19,"Is it worth saying again that humanity has interacted with this virus for 6-7 months? There are volumes that we didn't know and still don't know. Science isn't just a partisan conspiracy. Sometimes we learn something new that contradicts older observations. If we had a functioning public health service maybe we could have been more judicious in how this was managed. But we don't. So now everyone is an armchair epidemiologist and so sure of what should have been done or must be done to suit their personal experience and preferences. I am amazed at those who cite the improved mortality rates so hard earned by medical staff and people who died as a reason we shouldn't have shut down. How many thousands of dead people does it take before there is a little humility and care about how we proceed now? Since the virus is still here and the protests make it easy to spread we now have a natural experiment. We will find out if the closures of big cities prevented the virus from spreading to the rest of the country and, if it spreads, how our stressed small hospitals will manage. I hope these people who think there is some of new type of less susceptible human in non urban areas are correct."
2020-06-06 22:43:04,"I have to admit I’m a bit flummoxed by people who seem to think that as long as hospitals aren’t overflowing with dying people then the virus wasn’t such a big deal. Of course this has been economically devastating. No one should diminish that. But if you want to be angry about that, be angry at the authorities, mainly our incompetent president, who mishandled this from the beginning. Yes, our economy is important, but so are lives."
2020-06-06 21:03:15,"obvious ... these places shut down early in their respective curves ... and did the right thing ... exactly what some of the large population centers did not do, and paid a steep price in mortality ... now these places have a chance to fight the pandemic correctly ... open with caution ... test extensively ... quarantine and contact trace as necessary ... 

concluding that the virus was a hoax or ""not that bad"" is exactly the incorrect assumption ...

read about Australia and New Zealand and the policies in place in those countries ... and the impressive results"
2020-06-06 22:51:41,"Coming from a state with the third highest number of cases and deaths, due largely to lapses at both the state and federal level, I'm finding it hard to relate to those with few cases.

I guess my biggest question to residents in these low-case towns, is, do you know how many cases you would have had if you hadn't sacrificed?

This virus isn't going away.  Many of us in the high-risk category have become resigned to having our lives severely limited until there's a proven, availble vaccine and treatments--because the alternative is horrific.

Moreoever, with all the reopened states, there's will be more interstate travel, and I have no doubt  the virus is going to eventually hit just almost everywhere, once, twice, or multiple times.

It's a balancing act, and will require tradeoffs, something Americans aren't particularly good at accepting."
2020-06-06 23:07:48,"The situation in other parts of the country are not the same as those in NYC and some crowded areas.  We do not have crowded subways or sidewalks where contagion is high.
I feel that we did good when we closed down early - Houston cancelled their biggest huge event (the Rodeo) when the FIRST community transmission case was reported.  Some areas had dozens or hundreds of cases before they started to close or cancel things.  
Closing things early  was good - and gave everyone a chance to figure out what was going on with supplies and testing and transmission.  I thought Texas should have opened a a week or two earlier - when it was obvious that we weren't spiking in the number of case, and our steady level of cases could last for months - but I appreciate the measured response of the state of Texas.
In the past I was REALLY annoyed when the NYTimes  etal would criticize folks for being at the beach without any consideration for the difference in circumstances.  Now they'

Success is measured by no (or few) events and then people complain that you did too much. Failure is measured in death and the people complain you did not do enough. The lack of cases in many  areas is an indication of the success of physical distancing rules and stay-at-home orders implemented throughout the United States and other countries. In the US, only a few counties have yet to experience a case but the slow growth in cases over the last month supports the public health decisions."

I can afford to stay home and that is what I will continue to do because I am 66 and overweight with hypertension and type A blood (see, for example, yesterday's front-page NYT article about blood types). 
But the virus is NOT an equal opportunity threat across age groups or across all settings. A few months ago the WHO estimated the fatality rate as 3.5%. Yesterday, the CDC put it at 0.2%. Seasonal flu is 0.1%."

Health insurance is linked to employment and when unemployed, there it goes, out the window.  There is little or no sick leave for most of us.  Small businesses have not been getting the help they need.  Those in the gig economy are out of luck.  For many, unemployment is a joke when they are forced back to work.  The money, as usual is going to the big corporations whose lawyers can navigate the paperwork.  As usual, we are fighting each other and the Koch and Walmart families and their ilk are laughing.  Laughing all the way to the bank as the Stock Market does just fine.

Instead he delayed and made a crisis.  Science, data and planning matter."
2020-06-06 23:38:11,I live in a rural area in the south of New Jersey where there is very little virus and yet our governor is closing everything from North to Central to South in my state as if we were all the same population density as if we're all the same proximity with New York City it's completely ridiculous and it's been ridiculous from day one. I'm a lifelong progressive Democrat so this is not about my politics. it's about common sense and minimizing economic harm to people who are not living the fancy Manhattan lifestyle. with all the data and computer power we have we should be able to localize on a real-time basis where and who where to close down and open and back and forth as the numbers indicate. I've worked in hospitals a great deal of my life I care deeply about public health and community wellness and this approach to the shutdown has been way too heavy-handed.
2020-06-06 23:45:32,Until we have capability of testing and retesting at the rate of  around 4 million a day we will not know what is happening.

2020-06-07 00:03:44,"What is worse, by hiding behind the mantra of ""following the science,"" the policymakers who overreacted are trying to deflect responsibility for their decisions. In doing so, they are giving science a bad name, in a country whose relationship with science and science education is already shaky to begin with.

Science informs. It does not make policy judgments or weigh pros and cons. Governors and unelected health officials did that, and in instances where they struck the wrong balance, people should hold them accountable. 

If anything, the same policymakers should better acquaint themselves with math. Wrecking the lives of hundreds of millions of people over low probability events reflects a poor grasp of the numbers involved. As soon as it became clear that people without underlying medical problems were at only a remote risk, the policy decisions should have been adjusted accordingly. Instead, many governors and unelected health officials doubled down on overbroad policies and even vilified those people who correctly assessed the risk to themselves and their families as being remote.

I hope that if nothing else we will emerge from this with a better appreciation for what science is and isn't, the importance of democratic accountability, and the need for our society to evaluate risk in a more numerically competent fashion."
2020-06-07 00:17:09,"Part of why there had to be broad shutdowns was the lack of testing to tell public health officials where the virus was. We were largely in the dark because of lack of preparation on the federal level and this is one of the ways many suffered unnecessarily. With testing, tracing and isolation of cases, many parts of the country could have stayed open. But we didn’t have the public health capacity to put that in place quickly and we were facing exponential growth of cases, so we had to shut down."
2020-06-07 00:20:16,"I thought the lockdowns were a bit of an overreaction, but better safe than sorry--for a month.  I think most people felt that way.

But then it just went too far.  A month turned into 6 weeks, 10 weeks, etc.
""Flattening the curve"" morphed into ""wait for a 100% effective vaccine"" despite the clear CDC data.  

Anyone who read the data and decided reopenings were feasible was shouted down and called a murderer...until the Left thought they could do more damage to Trump if protests raged across the country.  Suddenly, mass gatherings were fine.  Reporters raced to them to cover them--the same reporters who told us we all needed to stay home just a few days before.

People 70 and over will need to stay home or wear and masks/gloves for the foreseeable future.  Sorry.  That's their new reality and it is indeed a tough one.  But the protests changed everything.  The rest of society will not go back into lockdown and the vulnerable--not everyone else--will need to take precautions."
2020-06-07 00:26:19,"When Canada first began implementing lockdown procedures, many epidemiologists were pointing out the obvious: if things worked as we hoped then we would have far fewer deaths than feared/expected. Of course, the same people understood the danger that if things worked, many people would not make the connection and would, instead, question the need for the lockdown measures in the first place. This article seems to highlight exactly that attitude. I live in New Brunswick, a province that has seen about 130 cases of C19 and one death. On the other hand, in Quebec, the neighbouring province, there are more than 58,000 cases and almost 5000 deaths. We know that this disease kills. We don't look at our good fortune as the result of the disease being overhyped; we understand that good govt policy prevented it from becoming a disaster for us. The question is why so many Americans in the places fortunate enough to have avoided the worst impact of C19 don't have the same understanding? I don't know anyone who has had C19 either, but I don't doubt the dangers posed by the virus nor do I doubt that it could easily take hold and cause a disaster here. In many of the places profiled here, the exact same dynamic applies. It won't take much to turn any one of these places into the epicenter of a major outbreak. BTW, we are slowly opening up our economy here, too, with the understanding that we may have to go back into lockdown if C19 cases start to climb."
2020-06-07 00:31:43,"The shutdowns are keeping the disease from the parts of country that were not hit early. It will come back and everyone will have a turn. Also, the anecdote is repeated several times in the article that some business owner does not know anyone with the disease - that's because they aren't hanging out with most susceptible racial and economic groups, AKA observational bias."
2020-06-07 01:11:39,"Shutdown was designed to stop the spread of the virus. In most of the country, it worked as expected, so few resulting deaths.  This is good news! 

This epidemic is still poorly understood. The country is reopening but there are obvious risks. Given the necessary lead time, a new outbreak could take off in September or October with unpredictable consequenses."
2020-06-07 01:12:20,"The strongest correlate of morbidity and mortality for this infection is population density. That is why NYC metro areas is the epicenter in the US and Begium in Europe.
The R0 or r naught is the rate of infectivity. It is proportional to how many close encounters you have with how many people. Walking down 5th Ave on a Sat you will encounter more people in 30 minutes than somebody from MOntana might see in a month and since the disease prevalence is already so much higher, even more the amount of Covid you will encounter.
Why would people assume that Montana, where Covid is very rare maybe 1% on the NYC rate, have to be judged by the same standards. For them the economic ruin may be much worse than the disease would ever be."
2020-06-07 01:50:52,"I am glad to see evidence of what I have been saying all along.

Dr. Faucci and others used a 50 lbs. hammer when a surgeon's scalpel approach was needed.

Even the number of fatalities prove the point.

Faucci and others disregarded the obvious ground zero of elderly home care facilities and vulnerable adults - and crowded cities.

I am 71 - I should know.  And I live in Bogota, Colombia - a crowded city of 7 million.

Of 110,000 plus fatalities in America - almost 30,000 come from elderly and those too confined to nursing homes.

I think as diverse as our country is - this NYC centric approach to the whole country - has been literally worse a cure than a disease.

I spent over 4 decades in the oil patch - all over the world.

When we have a serious incident in one of our facilities in a country - we take out advisories, safety bulletins etc to share lessons learned.

But we are always careful to let folks know one size does not fit all.  Folks in other locations should analyze their operations first and apply lessons learned accordingly.

I dare say Dr. Faucci and others will go down in history as pied pipers - who almost pushed our country off a cliff."

2020-06-07 02:06:46,"Let's make this simple. 
Many places don't have the viru because the major centers of infection (large metropolitan areas) were shut down and so were the remoter areas. 
Therefore, even if infected people traveled to another city whose businesses were shut, they couldn't give anyone the virus.
Remove the lockdown and everyone will have the virus.
Not complicated."
2020-06-06 23:11:18,Never was so much sacrificed by so many for so few.
2020-06-07 01:28:09,"Same thing in my part of Upstate NY.

We have had < 50 cases in the entire County.
Have only had 7 deaths since January attributed to the virus and all deaths were people with terminal illness.

People here are angry."
2020-06-07 01:57:42,"Please do not come to Utah.
We have the third highest rate of transmission in the Nation and will probably be number two by tomorrow. 
The majority here refuse to wear a mask or practice distancing."
2020-06-06 23:30:45,I thought that we shut down to “flatten the curve.”  But now people in this comments section are talking about staying in lockdown until there’s a vaccine??— that’s not what I agreed to!  When did that goal get changed?
2020-06-07 02:41:20,"The striking disconnect being referred to could be due to the fact that states and counties public health departments are poorly funded and lack epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists to guide in the decision making process.

Relying on 'low numbers of infections' without adequate testing could come back to haunt these areas.  This virus is very insidious.  It spreads wherever people congregates: churches, prisons, family, workplace, farm workers, food packaging plants, factories, warehouses, police department, hospitals etc."
2020-06-07 02:41:55,"For those questioning COVID 19 Lockdown protocols, a question or two...

Could it be the lack of cases/transmission/deaths in these less populated areas is a result of Lockdown/Social Distancing policies?

That if NY and NJ hadn’t enforced Shelter-In-Place policies these same areas could have had suffered a more virulent and fatal exposure to COVID 19?

Lastly, are you familiar with the phrase, “Better Safe Than Sorry”?"
2020-06-07 02:48:03,"The trouble with preventive measures is that if they are successful, we don't see the problems happening as they could have. So people think the problem wasn't all that bad to begin with. Very likely the stay-at-home orders prevented transmission of the virus into many smaller towns so they didn't get overwhelmed with cases, and it is clear that these measures flattened the curve in bigger cities. Certainly the case in WA.  Let's see what happens when the whole country open up without a coherent plan for testing and tracing."
2020-06-07 03:48:08,"Some Observations: 

It has been reported that a surprising small percentage of the infected do most of the transmission - Super Spreaders - who likely will be asymptomatic. So, yes most people won’t make you sick, but all it takes is one.

This transmission is most likely to happen with prolonged exposure in crowded situations. Which is why wearing a MASK is such a smart, simple easy way to reduce the possibility of catching and - more importantly - spreading the virus.

Social Distancing, Lockdown, Shelter in Place all slow the transmission and reduces the chance of exponential growth.

At this point the infirm elderly have suffered the greatest number of fatalities BUT the longer COVID 19 is propagated the more likely it will mutate, possibly as the 1918 virus did. 

I agree the Lockdown situation needs adjusting but remember, those areas that haven’t seen many cases/fatalities will be ’virgin territory’ for the Autumn version of the Corona Virus."
2020-06-07 03:59:04,"I live in California, but my family lives in N.C. These days, calling home is like calling through the twilight zone. Ive been locked down 85+ days and my cousins are visiting friends and having dinner parties. Admittedly, my negative feelings are fueled with some jealousy, but also with fear for their health. 

Thank you for sharing perspectives different than my own (and your target population). Humanizing the ‘other side’ through these stories had really changed my perspective on my family’s decisions"
2020-06-07 04:25:04,"This is the problem with a lack of testing.  This entire situation was poorly managed.  We should have had widespread testing, and areas with a large number of infections should have been shut down.  Other areas with low numbers could have remained open.  But that did not happen.  A one size fits all does not work, something we've known for a long time.  Those of us in New York might have needed a state wide shutdown while other areas did not.  However, the lack of testing was due to an administration that was not prepared.  Round 2 will no doubt arrive and we are still unprepared.  The fault lies totally with the trump administration which somehow thinks that wishing will be enough.  It is not."
2020-06-07 04:32:16,"Massive testing, contact tracing, self-isolation and quarantine, masks. Why didn't Americans learn from other countries successful responses?"
2020-06-07 04:37:26,"May I add one word in the conversation?

Incubation.

We won't know if reopening is a success for up to 14 days.

Let's add another layer.  An infected person can come into contact with a lot of people before his/her symptoms are apparent.  The situation can be out of control before anyone realizes.  It's a fast numbers game."
2020-06-07 06:13:09,"I cannot find fault with those who want to keep things locked down, and I cannot find fault with those who want to open things back up. There is no clear right answer now, we are making up the rules as we go along. Three years or so in the future we will have a better idea what we should have done in 2020 but for now it is just a lot of people with different opinions. In any event, I am confident we will get through this one way or another. It won't be the end of humanity."
2020-06-07 06:17:14,"We are told we have to listen to the experts, the scientists, but they don't have all the answers. Not faulting them, they've rallied and we'd be a lot worse off without them. But clearly they have been overwhelmed. Ditto for the politicians and bureaucrats and journalists and everyone else.

Thanks to the internet connected world we live in, this has become a massive, real-time, crowd-sourced interactive  emotional and intellectual learning experience for virtually the entire world's population. No one knows, everybody is trying to figure out what's going and how to deal with it. 

Take the example of masks. First our experts in said no, the public shouldn't wear masks, they don't work and we need to save them for the health workers. But people could see them being used in China, watch dissident YouTube videos and use common sense. So they began wearing them anyway. Then, fortunately, the experts and the politicians quickly reversed course, ratified the wisdom crowds and, perhaps less wisely, them mandatory, even when not really needed.

This does not prove crowds are always right, but it does indicate that experts are sometime wrong -- and that the relationship between people and experts (and ""authorities""of all kinds) is changing in this interconnected world of universal instant communication and infinite information. 

To better understand all this, I recommend ""Too Big To Know,"" a book by David Weinberger of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. An expert."
2020-06-07 07:49:52,"“None of them knows anyone local who has been sickened by the virus.”  This is because the shut down worked. Rejoice. Do you need piles of body bags stuffed with dead people to prove that the lock down was necessary?  

The charts show an across-the-board increase in unemployment, not related to infection rate.  If the states limit the lock down to high infection areas, these regions might save SOME employment, but at the cost of many dead people. 

Much or most of the employment losses are caused by a general decline in the economy."
2020-06-07 08:43:55,"Interesting to see the news media tiptoeing into suggesting that the coronavirus response may have been too extreme after leading the virus-fear hysteria from the start.  I suppose it's now forgotten, but in the beginning of the crisis officials projected up to 2 million deaths, so far we've had something like 5%, we may at worst possibly see considerably less than  10%, of that number.  I wonder if eventually it will be admitted that the economic damage from media cheerleading the exaggerated response will be shown to have been worse than the health damage done by the virus itself.  Government officials, most notably Mr. Trump, were relentlessly roasted for, as it now turns out, correctly giving a low assessment of the danger, why haven't the news media apologized for this?  Why don't they now proclaim in bold headlines that President Trump was right?  Why hasn't anyone called for the resignation of government officials and media executives who so severely overstated the risk, spreading so much fear and doing so much economic damage?  Has anyone suggested sending a bill to some notable news providers for the harm they may well have done?  What could that bill come to, a couple of trillion dollars?"
2020-06-07 10:14:36,"What wonderful expression of thoughts from Monday morning quarterbacks!

Your asking the developers of a successful action to prove a negative.  In light of what was known at the time and the unavailability of adequate testing, isolation was the only way to limit the spread.

The ‘only 5%’ death toll is low only if it doesn’t include you and yours."
2020-06-07 10:16:30,"To the apologists for President Trump, who say that he was correct in some of his pronouncements about the Covid virus:
He's the president, he could have faced the issue sooner, gathered info sooner and made up a game plan sooner.  Maybe the country would have still had to shut down, because that has seemed to work, but yes, maybe parts could have opened up sooner too.  Lack of cohesive and thoughtful planning at the top has resulted in a random and piecemeal approach to both the treatment of the virus and the stabilization of the economy."
2020-06-07 10:18:44,"The lockdown has taken on a moralistic dimension, which explains why people who want to reopen the economy are treated like heretics. People feel that lockdown is a worthy state of being because it is a sacrifice they’re making to protect the vulnerable. But the burden falls unevenly. It’s easy to stay at home in a nice house on full pay and the assurance of a job afterwards. It’s more difficult when you lose your paycheck, business, home, and ability to provide basic needs for your family. Most people who are infected with coronavirus don't even realize it or experience very mild symptoms for a few days. The loss of livelihood stemming from the lockdown, however, can have devastating consequences that last a lifetime.

One could argue that going out there and risking infection is also a worthy sacrifice, which would help to create herd immunity and enable people to hold onto their businesses and jobs. That could be accomplished while still protecting the elderly and medically vulnerable. We need less fear, less moral posturing, and more personal freedom."
2020-06-07 10:22:43,"One size fits all policies are simple.  The great dilemma of government is formulating and implementing effective, nuanced policies.  The policy response to the coronavirus pandemic is just one case in point, but a huge one."
2020-06-07 10:31:42,"If the nation-wide mass protests lead to a second wave we'll know that we can't afford to mess around. On the other hand, if the kind of contact at the magnitude of these enormous protests does not cause a significant rise in rates of infection and fatalities in coming weeks, we the people will be owed an explanation for being locked inside all this time and forced to wear masks (while police and many protestors do not wear them or wear them wrongly, lifting and lowering them constantly). Fauci said that he thought the protests would backfire causing untold infections, and added that it's an accidental ""social experiment."" The results of that ""experiment"" should be in soon. More than any other data so far, that should tell us where we're at right now in terms of contagion. If we want to know more we should be testing all the police out there in the crowds and do contact tracing on them. It's a rare opportunity to be precise in studying the spread of Covid 19. Why are we not systematically testing people we know have acted contrary to all the social distancing policies in place in cities like New York which was hardest hit? If the scientists were right, NY should be swimming in Covid 19 right now (aerosols and all). I wish there were more coverage of this issue as it would help guide intelligent discussion and policy going forward."
2020-06-07 10:33:27,"We seem to have messed up the virus response everywhere, instead of massive targeted testing and tracing from the very start... relying on uniform blunt force shutdowns even where it does no good, the price of walking blind."
2020-06-07 10:49:18,"Shutting down commerce wasn't intended to be a permanent solution. It was meant to slow down transmission long enough for communities to put other measures in place.

The virus can spread rapidly - sometimes infecting 2 or more people from each single infection, which leads to a single infection capable of infecting 100,000 people in just 15  or 16 cycles. Three to four months.

It doesn't spread evenly, each person able to choose the 2 who are infected. Instead, one person may not infect anyone, and another, can infect scores at wedding, or funeral, or open bull pen at work, or at a concert. Or a protest. 

We've learned this during the shutdown, just as we've learned that the disease can kill directly, often with pneumonia, and that ventilators are not always a good treatment. We've learned that some people need anticoagulants. We've learned to recognize the immune response - a type of viral sepsis-like illness that affects healthy people and children and teens.

Lockdowns can be eased if we have learned to wear masks, seek out infections through testing, isolate sick people and nip superspreader events in the bud. 

Areas with low infection rates can reopen. But if they don't have testing, tracing, or ICU beds ready and waiting, then they were failed by their leaders who squandered the time and left only a legacy of hardship. 

No one should have lost a job so that their politicos could whine a lot but do nothing."
2020-06-07 11:01:17,"This is an economic crisis caused by clueless public health officials and their enablers. Now the economy is reopening and the damage will be slowly reversed even though the number of new cases has been the same for the last 2.5 months. We are going to be in this situation for the next year. If you're going to do something six months later, you might as well do it now."
2020-06-07 12:10:43,"Let me get this straight. If there were a huge rise of cases, then the ""experts"" on Cornavirus would be right. We definitely need to lock down the country and devastate the economy. And if there are no cases, then the lock downs worked as well, proving how right the ""experts"" were / are. Either way, we need to continue to lock down, social distance, and wear masks. Heads we're right. Tails we're right. I totally support science and scientists because this science thing is just ""amazing"" (at least in a political sense)."
2020-06-07 12:14:27,"It’s good to finally read  a nytimes article about more places in the us. I live in western pa and we often feel like we live in a strange parallel universe out here. This article is LONG overdue.  The times needs to keep in mind that most of the country is not LA, NYC, DC or Miami. Nobody I know can name anybody with a confirmed Covid test and there have been only 21 cases in my county. Yet we are suffering the same unemployment. Possibly more— small communities depend on small businesses that have been forced to close, and my rural neighbors lack internet and generally can’t work remotely.  We are a farming community, and the shutdown has been disastrous for farmers, though they have had low infection rates for the disease."
2020-06-07 12:16:41,"The even bigger striking disconnect is Trump's unwillingness to implement some of the best practices in both South Korea and Taiwan. At this late date the lack of a cohesive and comprehensive approach to address this pandemic is simply deplorable. It is precisely because there is a lack of fidelity with testing, identifying those infected and PPE supplies that our communities are wandering blind in essentially a Covid-19 minefield threat--- real or imagined."
2020-06-07 12:25:08,"It's the TESTING, dummy.

Had the Federal government instituted a coordinated, universal NATIONAL diagnostic testing regime, with contact tracing, at the start of the outbreak (or even now), much of the economic hardship might have been avoided. 

But the President either didn't understand it or chose willfully to ignore it.

Second-guessing public health officials now is very unfair; the prime failure was Trump's initial (and continuing) unwillingness to engage with the pandemic at the Federal level."
2020-06-07 12:59:19,"It is a great irony. Those places which have not yet felt the virus will lift social distancing, open up, and consequently see an increase in cases. In areas with limited hospital capacity, that capacity will be overwhelmed quickly. Then, the economy will close again, and the reason will be obvious to most. In some rural areas this is already happening. Given time, it will happen in more and more areas. There are many months before the election. The personal impacts from the lack of coordinated, early leadership will become more and more personal to those who still do not accept reality. Who still believe the virus is overblown, or even a hoax."
2020-06-07 13:02:47,"The divide, demographic and geographic, that Mr. Trump exploits is certainly exemplified here.  When dealing with the country as a whole, we have to differentiate the range between urban and rural.  The framers of the Constitution did when they created the House, the Senate, and the Electoral College.  

The dimensions of the pandemic in high density urban areas is certainly different than in agricultural communities.  The Democrats would do well to  reflect it in their policy decisions.  Mr. Trump divisively exploits this difference all the time.  The Democrats should acknowledge, respond,  and unite.  

The Times needs more articles that show the diversity of this country for the pandemic and other factors.  We're  a country dangerously divided, and  part of that is based on geography.  A measure of  human intelligence is the ability to make distinctions."
2020-06-07 13:29:37,"I find this article very telling about the press being as culpable as the president for fanning the flames of the crisis.  3 months ago the headlines and opinion pieces were asking about government doing enough and more rapidly vs. considering the impact of the location and severity of the lockdowns.  You sold your papers and got the result anyone with half a brain expected; namely economic catastrophe.  Now, for some reason, the result of the lockdowns was ill-conceived.  

I would not be without the press.  It is the great check on power.  However, I am sorely disappointed that the screaming headlines that sell papers and increase viewing are not somehow kept in check.  Perhaps the prevailing attitude of act then think will be replaced with some thought about the consequences of yelling ""fire"" in the theater."
2020-06-07 13:42:14,"If there had been leadership at the national level, a three week, country-wide lockdown in January followed by contact tracing would have ended this crisis for everyone, saved millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. What a lost opportunity."
2020-06-07 13:46:51,"This article highlights that we've failed to be smart going in to the COVID pandemic and we continue to fail as we move through it. 

We allowed the usual elites among our leaders and influencers, especially in the MSM, to try to impose protocols and lock downs using a one size fits all mindset. The US is not France or some other centralized states where that works. We should have been more explicit in each state as they set their own path to containment and re-opening, seeing what works and what doesn't. 

As a result, we allowed what could have been a contained economic impact, like in Sweden, to instead be detonated like an atomic bomb over the entire country. Millions of businesses and employees were needlessly thrown out of work. It is still uncertain how long this recovery may take.

And why was that? Our elitist leaders didn't have to face the consequences of their actions. They were all queued up to work from home or from remote location that they fled to. They lost no income. They've been able, for the most part, manage their children's learning so it could be as effective as possible.

The rest of America has borne the brunt of a self-entitled, moneyed class dictating from on high about how they valued life - meaning their own - to the detriment of so many others.

These protest are not just about George Floyd and racial injustice. They are also about the economic and social chasm between the haves and the haves-not in this country exposed by COVID."
2020-06-07 14:08:04,"No one made the governors of Texas, Wisconsin, Colorado or any other state shut down.  They did it on their own and if there was a less restrictive way to avoid the infections becoming widespread in their communities, they either didn't try it or didn't have time to because they had never thought it out in advance.  They failed to plan in advance how they would deal with an epidemic.  

Another reason these communities have had few cases has to do with people in areas where infections were out of control staying home under lock down orders and people not flying to their communities from NYC or New Orleans or another area with high infections.   Our actions helped them avoid the spread to their areas.  If people in Texas have a problem with the shutdown, they need to blame their Republican governor for it, not what other governors with different situations did.  

This didn't have to be a one size fits all response.   If governments at all levels had done what they should have done, plan in advance how to deal with an epidemic, we could have avoided a lot of the economic pain.  

It's all hindsight at this point.  What's done is done."
2020-06-07 15:09:14,"If people can't relate to anything beyond their own personal experience are living in tiny thimbles. People who read, who have empathy and imagination and are able to make connections live in much bigger worlds. Alas, they are the minority."
2020-06-07 16:21:45,"My family did everything that was asked and we shut down our lives for 3 months so that our state could safely navigate the virus. My teens haven't seen their friends until recently, and only with masks and social distancing. 

We still aren't allowed to be in a group of more than 10 in our state. And yet if you're part of the BLM rallies all over the country, the rules don't apply. You can have half a million at a rally with people shoved all together and even if most are wearing masks, experts say it's the social distancing that matters more. I understand the cause and if people at rallies were only risking their lives, that would be their choice. But they are risking others' lives and getting applauded for their actions, since everyone feels that it's worth it. 

The people fighting to open up the economy were vilified but these rallies are considered more important than my health? There will be a resurgence of the virus. I think every doctor and nurse should walk off the job in protest. 

Black Lives Matter, but they don't matter more than my immune compromised daughter or my 81 year old parents."
2020-06-07 17:17:10,"All of this praise for Sweden but why?

The study's results have provided further fuel for the critics of the Swedish approach. With 39.26 deaths per 100,000, Sweden's mortality rate is not only higher than that of the U.S. (29.87 deaths per 100,000) but also exponentially higher than those of its neighbors Norway (4.42 per 100,000) and Finland (5.56 per 100,000), which both enacted strict lockdown measures, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
2020-06-07 17:37:27,"After reading about the economic pain due to shutting down, I felt, again, anger at an administration that first denied the seriousness of the pandemic and then flirted on and off continually with believing/not believing the science and sending horribly mixed messages to a nation desperately needing leadership.  If we had the leadership from the beginning, perhaps the science would have helped identify low incidence infection and a PLAN would have been implemented.  Anger needs to be directed at a lack of leadership and a pause remembering over 100,000 lost.  Where's the accountability for those grieving families?"
2020-06-07 17:57:03,"So distressing and frustrating  that we have only seemed to learn a few lessons. The one under review here: a universal lockdown is economically devastating & inequitable: Predictable !  I grew up in Corpus Christi-and gale force winds off the ocean are as usual as is the more desired Gulf breeze. People should have been able to go to the beach, go fishing and eat outside all along. And I agree with those who observe : "" If you can go to the grocery, the pharmacy, the hardware/home goods/auto mechanics/ why can't you go to other businesses if everyone wears a mask and washes their hands.?"" Let us hope that if the next pandemic is not smallpox, the plague or ebola (severe rules ) that we can remember how this played out.  I think wearing a mask when anything like this rears its head is common sense and social duty. Why that is off the table for some I will never understand. People in places where most have a car, and most live in a more detached building without elevators are safer and are not likely "" to get theirs; just wait and see"". We need to have learned a variety of governmental and health provider strategies which are more location and demographic dependent. And we certainly need to fix our broken, fragmented health care system at all levels of government and private provider management. And , of course things like travel, public transportation, huge entertainment and sporting venues, crowded public schools and college campuses call for their own targeted approaches."
2020-06-07 18:35:53,"The NYT needs more articles like this. 
Our minds are simple and at first think only about the immediate consequence of possibly dying from an infection. Only after more sophisticated thinking, or for some having to live it out, do we realize that the long-term absence of livelihood can be worse than the short-term presence of disease, that we do not actually prioritize extending life at all cost, and since no community is perfectly average policies designed to fit the average community will fit no community perfectly."
2020-06-07 19:32:25,"I live in Corpus Christi. A group of biologists at our local branch of Texas A&M University has been working with local government and presenting data to the public each Friday for about eight weeks now. Their analysis of cell phone data showed that people started working from home and staying away from malls, restaurants, doctor’s offices, etc. weeks before our governor ordered the statewide shutdown. This behavior indicates that there were plenty of people who saw the shutdown as necessary. Our local Public Health Department got very lucky because the meat processing plant and a company that ran transitional housing, two early sites of outbreaks, responded immediately and cooperated fully. Things could have spiraled out of control had there not been cooperation. Perhaps some things could have opened earlier, but life seen in retrospect is always so much clearer. My big concern now is that tourists have returned in droves. I do not worry about the beaches but about the indoor spaces that the tourists inhabit, most not having the courtesy to respect their host city government’s request that everyone wear face coverings. These people are coming from other parts of Texas or other states with larger outbreaks not yet under control. For now, we wait."

MI was the best example, but this happened in many areas.  The over reaction of local government and/or governors in these areas enabled the conspiracy theories to grow, and spread.  We need to be safe.  But, we need to be realistic.  The Dems seem to want this virus to last for months, or at least the fear.  I'm so disgusted with their politicizing of this virus!"

You've been promoting economic destabilization with your slanted news since this virus broke out. If you want my evidence go to my website, 'themissing-news.com', where I've copied, annotated and referenced as much scientific information as I could find, e.g. look into the subtle and misleading use of phrases like 'asymptomatic', to support lockdowns and stigmatize at least 95% of non-symptomatic people who are non infectious, as opposed to the much smaller number who are 'PRE SYMPTOMATIC', some of whom may be obviously sick tomorrow, but by no means all. Many of us evidently have immune systems robust enough to fight this virus, and by the way, has anyone noticed or reported that the virus has weakened as it's aged and mutated?"

2020-06-07 16:32:42,"Until a vaccine is available, there are 3 groups of people.  Those who: (1) are immune, (2) currently have the virus, and (3) are susceptible to the virus.   So, logically, areas that currently have “fewer infections” will have a virus spike, as restrictions are relaxed and Group 2 mixes with Group 3.  Logically, in areas where Group 3 show a large up-spike in contagion, Groups 2 & 3 will retreat and much of the employment gains in these areas may be lost.    

Is it possible to stimulate employment while limiting new cases and deaths?  Yes, but, it requires a coordinated effort of government, communities, and individuals to open areas currently with ""few infections"": (1) mask, test, & trace (2) create a zone around Groups 2 & 3 seniors through quarantine, daily testing of their contacts, and providing funding, food & support. (3) Move outside wherever possible, since outdoors is much safer:  (a) small businesses should be permitted to use the sidewalk [with electric & plumbing, if safe]; (b) where feasible, stores should have drive-up window traffic only; (c) businesses should support work-at-home and move facility-critical employees to covered but side-open parking lots; (d) places of worship should provide video services or outdoor services, where possible or, if necessary, spread way out [>>6 ft] indoors with masks, multiple repeat services, improved HEPA-filtered ventilation [casino-like smoke vents], and vocalists behind Plexiglas.

The New York Times for months has been reporting on the pandemic as though New York and New Jersey are typical.  That reporting has treated those in (mostly Republican) and ""flyover"" states as alarmingly ignorant and reckless for complaining about the economic damage being created by pandemic limitations.  Not to mention disregarding the emotional distress caused by lack of income, children held at home, educational limitations, etc.  

None of that mattered to the Times reporters, who now profess to have discovered that many people were simply not that affected by this terrible disease!  And yet are being punished by the unequal application of those overly broad, un-subtle regulations and rules so roundly supported by Times editors and writers.

Worse we have a wimpy  Democratic governor and a state health director originally from the NYC area with zero experience in either patient care or epidemic management, both of whom are afraid of their own shadows and adamant to treat North Carolina as if it were New York City. Who is to blame for this national lunacy? It is you, the national media, controlled from a handful of large cities with high dependency on public transportation, and the Democratic Party which runs those cities.  It has been the goal of the cities since the earliest days of the Republic to run the entire country in their image. Hamiltonian vs Jeffersonian democracy. Flyover country has always been Jeffersonian. The failure of the urbanists on this one is breathtaking, and the complicity of the media, the Times being high on the list, is scandalous.

I had been purchasing Brooks Brothers clothing in the past few years and the quality was not what it had been. Many outfits were already made in China and most of what I bought didn’t last. My impression was that the brand had already lost its essence as a purely US made store, admired for its impeccable style and quality.

2020-06-06 13:52:42,"Consider that Brooks has $300 million in debt on $1.0 billion in sales. This is not a sustainable ratio for any retailer to carry, even one with a great name and tradition as Brooks. Many retail acquisitions in recent years have been financed with increasing levels of debt, which, when things turn south, allow the enterprise no wiggle room to weather a storm. Retailing is cyclical - one day you're in the penthouse, the next day you're in the outhouse. 

One of the seeds of Brooks' problems started in 2015-16 when they ""reinvented"" their top-selling oxford cloth button-down shirt. They added a few minor details but took away the chest pocket. The retail price was $140. Never mind that the basic BDOC they carried in 6 basic solid colors and several stripes had retailed successfully for $92. Within two years, this old standby, the company's best-seller was discontinued and disappeared. I feel bad for the shirtmakers in Garland because a $140 shirt in three color options will never replace a $92 best seller in eight color options. Go to Brooks' website, click on the oxford cloth Polo button-down that sells for $140. Note the 3.4 out of 5 rating and read the comments from loyal Brooks customers who remember the old classic. If your merchants replaced a bestseller that sold for $92 and traditionally rated 4.5 for a ""new, improved model"" that sold for $140 and garnered a 3.4 rating, should they still be working for Mr. Del Vecchio?"

And if you are not looking for work, could that keep you from being counted as unemployed? May's number is so contrary to everyone's projection, that it leads me to believe its being distorted. The number of people who where working before the pandemic, compared to the number of people working now, is far more telling."

2020-06-05 13:34:46,"Over 20 million jobs lost by early May and this number doesn't include those who simply gave up trying to apply for unemployment insurance.  It's nice to see the economy coming back, but at this rate it will be 10 months before we reach full employment again.  

These reports don't even begin to account for the layoffs to come.  Right now there are millions of workers who have been furloughed (not technically unemployed) or asked to take their vacation time in lieu of work days.  Will they be returning to work?  Many don't think so.   The jobs ""coming back"" are the lowest paid. Those that will be lost in the coming months are the white collar and better paid.  

The president's elation is premature."
2020-06-05 13:36:03,It’s shocking to read all the comments from those who are rooting for an economic collapse just so that Trump isn’t re-elected on the strength of a recovering economy.  Unemployment is down and stock market is up almost 700 points as I write this but that too will be explained as “economic inequality”.  Take a break from politicizing everything and enjoy some good news for a change.
2020-06-05 13:37:29,"As others have noted, the unemployment rate was likely higher than 14.7% because the claims filed in April and May didn't reflect those already out of work, no longer receiving benefits, or those who had yet to file. Even though certain sectors are returning to work, that may not guarantee new jobs, or keeping jobs: hospitality work like hotels, restaurants, and bars will be severely constrained by pandemic cautions, and you can't pay your high rent with the measly income from only 25% capacity; we're likely to see a lot of additional layoffs because of bar/restaurant closures in the next couple of months. 

Further, I don't understand the discrepancy between two Times reports: One, earlier this week, which said that 1.8 million filed for unemployment, and now this, 2.5 million jobs created. Which is it? You can't have both—because 2.5 minus 1.8 equals 700k new jobs created. Ok, it's still a dip, but it's not the same kind of dip.

2020-06-05 13:52:24,"A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

I imagine the picture is less rosy than the numbers suggest, being there's so many nuances to measuring unemployment. But I'll take it anyway! First good news in a week."
2020-06-05 13:54:08,"Fantastic news! I'm on furlough until July 27, and my prayer has been to be called back sooner. I'm so glad to see this, as I'm sure are millions of Americans who want to return to their lives and livelihoods. 

Don't look for the cloud - this is great news!"
2020-06-05 13:54:50,"Let's give this fiction the benefit of the doubt for a second (which is a stretch, since these figures don't reflect the true rate): gosh, only 13.3% unemployment? Clearly the US is in great shape, and this is a victory for Trump!

Or not: highest unemployment in the Great Recession of 2008-9 was 9%

How many people can't pay their mortgages, their rent, pay their utility bills, can't buy enough food? Wall Street loves this number. Ordinary Americans are suffering, with more on the way, not to mention over 100,000 dead because, well, Trump didn't bother to read his advisers' warnings in January. Much of this could have been avoided."
2020-06-05 13:55:23,"Leaving aside the nuances in the numbers, why do people even bother to ask economists for predictions any more? 

They're very rarely accurate, and instances like this make it clear that they're simply guessing. Nothing more. 

And yet they continue to be treated as if they deserve respect.

Why do reporters continue to play this game?"
2020-06-05 13:56:31,"California, the day before yesterday, admitted that half of the people who are unemployed have not yet been cleared for a check.

Most still cannot get through, lost in endless phone loops.
How many have not received that $1200 check?
How many are out of the loop completely?

Last week The Times wrote that only 15% of children who are qualified (what does that mean anymore?) have gotten food supplements.
Have the other 85% been found yet?

Sorry, but I haven't taken the numbers from Wall Street as an indicator of the health of this country for decades.

""S&P 500 jumped 2 percent....""
That's no longer news... and never was an indicator of this nation's economic health."
2020-06-05 13:56:37,"I am not a conspiracy guy, and I would never ask this question in normal times, but because we are living under a constant flood of propaganda and lies that are generated from every part of the federal government that Trump can get his hands on, it needs to be asked:

How do we know these numbers are real and have not been altered in some way?"
2020-06-05 13:57:01,"These are bogus numbers.  There are currently 30 million people collecting unemployment in the US as reported by the Washington Post today.  There are 150 million workers in the US.  That's 20% unemployment.  If unemployment was really only 13%, then there would have to be 230 million workers out of 320 million people.  There are far too many children and retired for that to be true."
2020-06-05 13:57:02,"HR 1010 was just passed through the Senate and it will be signed by Trump today. Isn't it convenient that it extends PPP use for 24 weeks ( November) rather than the original 8 weeks? Is it live or is it Memorex?

Are people ""working"" or just not collecting wages from UI?

What we really need to do is to educate people to learn to analyze data and the people who cook the books. 

The real damage to the economy won't be fully known until the patient comes out from the anesthesia. I'm betting on a major relapse."
2020-06-05 13:57:25,"Always want to know what kind of jobs are being filled. Hourly, no benefits, minimum wage? Or a job that can provide at least the cost of living? That’s the statistic that matters and I wish it would be reported as part of every unemployment-rate article."
2020-06-05 13:57:52,"This drop in unemployment is due to two things: service and hospitality workers being recalled and PPP loans keeping people on payrolls. Unemployment will remain high or increase again throughout the summer as businesses run out of PPP money and not enough demand returns to sustain employment. 

Looking at my own employer, at least 10% of the professional staff has no billable work to do and the only thing keeping them employed is PPP. Unless something miraculously improves in the next month those people are on the street in July."

Most of the unemployed will stay unemployed for years as most companies see no reason beyond small crew to get their businesses restarted."
2020-06-05 13:59:37,"I've employed a small landscape company to mow my weed infested lawn every other week for the past few years. It was a two-man shop, but the owner's sole employee informed him in early April that he would make more money if the owner laid him off so he could collect ""enhanced"" unemployment. The owner refused as the gardening season was about to begin. The employee then quit, claimed he had been terminated due to the virus, and informed the owner that he now makes $350 more per week than before. The owner advised that it would run out on July 31. The employee said he'd then return to work. The owner's reply, ""I think not."""
2020-06-05 13:59:48,I don't think it was a surprise to people who want live by working instead of govt. handouts. Trump knows their pulses. Pundits and experts who have been predicting gloom and doom do not understand American spirit and people's determination.
2020-06-05 14:00:30,"These numbers are a strong indication that no further action in terms of the stimulus is needed, however absurd that may sound.  Take a look at stock market.  Very close to all time high.  Today, in this situation, at nearly all time high.  No further comment needed.  Whatever it is that the govt is doing, it is massively helping the shareholders who stagger laughing all the way to the bank.  Such a profound affront to all those who lost jobs and face murky future.  Either we make sure that, figuratively, djia and sp500 do not move as they move, or we do nothing anymore, including firmly stopping J Powell from lifting the shareholders at the expense of common folks.

Alternatively, we admit that the corporate America is several enormously rich companies (any literate person will know which they are) and the rest is good for nothing, unnecessary, and good riddance, people included."
2020-06-05 14:01:05,I am surprised this surprises anyone!  I am surprised a decrease in the unemployment numbers would no be expected.  based on people returning to work out of financial desperation; which has more power then the fear of the virus.  There is another important factor.  Young adult see themselves as more or less immune from Covid 19.
2020-06-05 14:01:35,"Sorry, I don't believe the numbers, and it would not surprise me if this administration has fudged the numbers to make it appear that the pandemic turned out to be no big deal, as thousands more people have died, and Trump stays quiet on the subject. I have to look at my own city, where restaurants are open, but empty, and many stores have gone out of business or haven't opened yet. Where are the jobs coming from? Let's see some real information that we can believe."
2020-06-05 14:02:55,The unintended benefit of these mass demonstrations will be to lift to economy more quickly than might have otherwise occurred because we are no longer timid and uncertain in the face of the pandemic. Thousands suddenly in the streets at close quarters has acted as a second round of stimulus payments.
2020-06-05 14:02:59,"PPP is keeping a lot of folks on payroll, as other have noted.  The demand is not there in a lot of sectors; once PPP runs out, things could get bad.  Who knows? It all depends on demand. 

If $700B was doled out and the average payout was $90,000, it represents just under 8m businesses and roughly $67,000 of payroll expenses for 8 weeks.  If the average worker benefitting from PPP takes home $7k every 8 weeks, it is roughly 9.5 workers/business.  9.5*7.8m businesses equals 74m workers benefiting from PPP.  

If 1/3 of these jobs go away after the PPP is extinguished, 25m people will be on the dole and the unemployment rate will spike to 25% or so."
2020-06-05 14:03:19,"One caveat noted by the U.S. Labor Department: the unemployment rate “would have been about 3 percentage points higher than reported” if data were reported correctly, according to the agency’s statement. That refers to workers who were recorded as employed but absent from work due to other reasons, rather than unemployed on temporary layoff.

Fake news!"
2020-06-05 14:03:53,"This article doesn't mention the denominator-the most important component of unemployment.  I suspect that many workers surveyed said they had stopped looking for work--even many who are receiving unemployment--which would make sense in these times since looking for work is not really possible when the economy is largely shut down.  These workers would be excluded from the denominator, even though our common experience tells us that these workers should be classified as unemployed.  A closer look at the data is necessary.  

I also trust the independence of BLS, but as with the census bureau, CDC, and so many other data-driven federal agencies, meddling from the White House for political purposes can't be ruled out.  The way in which unemployment is measured is also in serious need of revision, and this predates Trump."
2020-06-05 14:05:13,"From Financial Times comment section:   
""The BLS website has a clarification that for the Household Survey that is used to compute the Unemployment Rate, Workers who are away from work on account of Covid-19 related Business closures should be classified as ""Unemployed - on temporary layoff"" but on account of an apparent anomaly that they are still investigating, such workers are currently being counted as ""Employed"" in the Household Survey since March. The BLS says that correcting this classification would mean an Unemployment rate for May about 3.0% higher than what has been reported today. But as per established practice, Household survey data are not adjusted, and are reported as collected. Just something to ponder on for a second or two, as the Stock Market heads to the moon."""
2020-06-05 14:05:54,I guess there is no pandemic or unemployment. Everything is just like it was in January. Markets are so predictive!
2020-06-05 14:06:02,"With this great news and the stock market on its way to record highs,
The economy will rebound fast. Time for us Democrats to panic, because
This will guarantee a second Trump Term, people vote their pocket books.
Those who have little vote little,so sad."
2020-06-05 13:28:51,"For once, please define what ""job"" actually means. Be honest.  Many of us have returned to work, but too few have returned to full time employment.  We will be paid less than a live able wage but will become ineligible for unemployment. Be honest. Too many ""jobs"" have been poor jobs all along, but the slick definition of ""job""  is used by Republicans for propaganda. Report the truth, please. It would be better for the Times to rank jobs in terms of income. It is possible, so why not? Example: how many ""new or returning"" jobs now pay less than $10,000/year and how many more than $100,000? How many with benefits? As businesses reopen, how many will use this as an excuse to cut salaries? I can't think of one person who is returning to work full time. Everyone's hours have been cut, and so has their income. It is the job of the New York Times to present a balanced report of actual facts, not just Trump spin and propaganda. That is the job of Social Media, or Fox News."
2020-06-05 14:07:26,"The problem is that the underlying problem of the pandemic was not solved before reopening state economies. Thus, when state numbers rise high enough that business are required to close their doors the employees will just become unemployed again. If only testing had began earlier, contract tracing had been implemented, and states had waited to reopen until proper drops in cases had taken place than the brunt of this issue could have been avoided. Instead we will be dealing with economic loss and death for the foreseeable future."
2020-06-05 14:08:30,"Why is this a surprise?  At least where I live restaurants and other closed business have started to reopen and more people are out.  There is significantly more traffic on the roads which means people are doing something.  Hospitals have started elective surgery again.

Statistics are never accurate and we can all suspect some conspiracy by the Trump and the White House to fudge numbers, but at least based on personal observation they look real."
2020-06-05 14:08:31,"Hard to believe these numbers. Many newly employed appear to be part- time work, and many still struggling financially. I will wait a few months yet to see what is always a “ revision” of prior numbers and see what then shows up. Are they counting those on furlough as still employed?"
2020-06-05 14:08:45,"Why don't we wait until the PPP expires to see if this trend is a true recovery or an artificial spike? At least in the restaurant industry, where I work and job gains were the greatest, many businesses remained closed or severely curtailed while using the PPP to access 'grants' for business expenses. Employers aggressively funded payroll in order to meet the terms of loan forgiveness so on paper, it appeared that we had jobs. We didn't; we had paychecks. What is left of PPP funds is now being conserved since the payroll requirement is certain to be reduced. Our business is still severely curtailed, and I, along with many workers in similar positions, are now back on unemployment...just as expanded benefits are soon to expire."
2020-06-05 14:08:49,"Yes, we are in a planetary double crisis like the rest of the world. There are choices to be made, positive ones for most and some will make negative ones for themselves. many will be very painful. 

We the people can stop everything, continue to stay home, we can spend our days protesting expecting ""the government"" to cover our economic and other needs ... but most Americans want only to be able to earn their own livings, stand on their own two feet, take care of their families, run their businesses even while taking all the Covid precautions that are required. 

Surely there are many difficult times ahead for most. People are not fooling themselves, but there is something deep in many of the ignored Americans that will most likely keep them going, build their futures over again. 

The doomsayers rarely get things ,right mid-term, about the US as a nation."
2020-06-05 14:09:39,When PPP runs out...we'll likely be up again. We hired people back for 8 weeks to ensure the loan is forgiven per the requirements. After that...not optimistic about maintaining that personnel count.

2020-06-05 14:10:59,"Gig jobs, part-time jobs, per diem jobs, temporary jobs, minimum wage jobs?  This is not included in the jobs report.  And the corporations continue to reap rewards.  Why is this not addressed in the jobs report?"
2020-06-05 14:11:56,"This is a bogus data. In May restaurants, bars,retail stores were mostly closed. Hotels were reporting very low occupancy. How could restuarants, leisure and retail could add so many jobs. last month the unemployment rate was understated as tabulation errors were reported. In simple math, 40 millions claimed unemployment benefits. Total work force is 160 millions. Unemployment rate amounts to 25%. How could the rate be 13.3% if the claims are 40 millions? The surprise is in math."

This is the PPE doing the talking.

2020-06-05 14:15:24,"That doesn't mean the problems are over.  We still have a very high unemployment rate and the unofficial one is probably much higher.  We now have the perfect economic climate to marginalize even more people than before.  Do our politicians (and us) want to live in a country where impoverishment is the norm and not because people are unwilling to work but because employers are unwilling to pay, unions aren't allowed to enroll employees, and employees are tossed aside, not viewed as assets, and citizens are expendable?  Do we want to live in a country like that?"
2020-06-05 14:15:42,"These unemployment numbers are totally meaningless.  They are not representative of what's taken place (over 40 million initial claims in the last 2 months).    

There's something so fishy here.  I'm afraid that the politicization of those statistics that can move markets, like employment or inflation, is reaching new heights.   The name of the game for Trump and his minions, who include many Wall streeters,  is to get the stock market up by hook or by crook.  That's all he's got and he's clearly ready to do anything to achieve it."

The virus is still amongst us and remains to be seen how the protests will affect the number of cases.  I am no expert on the stock market but for some reason, I think it's fishy the way it kept going up when historically it would have dropped.  I'm skeptical about these employment numbers as well. We have a bunch of crooks in this administration."

2020-06-05 13:48:20,"NOT a major trend - just a re-entry blip. It will improve a bit but two mitigating factors will tell the true story shortly.

1. As Federal funding for unemployment, PPP etc. ends, the depth of this depression will be unparalleled, especially in the black communities. 

2. The Covid increase from ignorant people in ignorant States will skyrocket, putting heretofore unprecedented stress upon healthcare systems again. Smaller states with less capability, especially in the south, will be devastated and very well may have to shut down completely again.

Trump will claim ""victory"", but he will, as usual, be wrong. The lives that this prematurely rapid and uncontrolled re-entry will cost are unreplaceable. The ""second wave"", which could have been avoided at this point, will sink us. Don't spend all that bonus unemployment money yet - the worst is yet to come.

Irrational exuberance!

I've been doing this work for nearly 20 years, and I've lived in this constantly growing city my entire life. I have a frame of reference.

I can say, with absolute certainly, that people are going back to work. A month ago, two months ago, these roads were empty. Last week more people were out. This week, even more. Next week, it will be more still.

So, doubt the numbers, question their source, or trust them, it's your call. But I assure you people ARE absolutely returning to work at an exponential rate. When that ends, when we plateau though, is hard to know. But there's reason to be optimistic, to whatever degree you choose to be."

Economists are shocked at these numbers. How can so many suddenly be so wrong? Furthermore, Trump and his bungling team have been flailing and desperately trying to rescue a dying presidency. They first denied the pandemic and then after failing to manage it, switched the subject. Then it tried to send the military into American cities in response to protests against the pandemic of police brutality and then used that brutality to virtue signal to white evangelicals, just last Monday. When that turned into a revolt by the military establishment, now we suddenly have a rosy jobs picture by Friday. With the most corrupt administration in history that repeatedly lies, obfuscates, and deflects, this is incredibly suspicious, especially the timing of being released on Friday to dominate the weekend news.

How can you convince people to stay home after this?  

How can you argue that the American consumer will be too scared of the virus to participate in the economy?

People are unabashedly not afraid.  And the lockdowns lost their continued legitimacy.

Under cover of darkness of the COVID-19 pandemic, the governors ordered business shut downs, to camouflage the deeply embedded problems in law enforcement in the urban areas of the country. Those who voted for these governors were deceived, neglected and hurt. 

The unemployment falling as predicted or unexpected is a relief but it could only be temporary, the nation is awakened to the injustice that has been done for a long time for too many. Trump needs to admit that America has serious problems and he needs help from the people outside the Washington DC belt way to resolve them. He decided to run for the highest office, he won, he went to DC with the promise to clear the swamp, but the swamp had moved to the urban areas of the country primarily the mega cities NY, LA, Chicago, Detroit. 

The US congress shoveled money to suppress injustice,  but it was too late, the explosion of anger has taken place and no power  and no amount of money is going to make a difference.

In a few weeks the PPP money will run out and restaurants will be on their own again.

We must also once again confront the unemployment rate versus the labor participation rate. How many people are actually looking for jobs? Every decent paying employer I know is on a hiring freeze. You needn't bother looking for a job at the moment. Few places worth working are hiring. If you aren't looking, you aren't counted as part of the unemployed. The unemployment rate therefore falls.

The question we now confront is which influence has the greater impact going forward. Continued jobless or systemic under counting in unemployment.

According to BLS, those who ""were unable to work because an employer closed or lost business"" because of COVID-19 are no longer considered unemployed--they're considered out of the workforce.

2020-06-05 14:57:35,"Not exactly sure why the surprise or mystery with unemployment stats.  May saw many businesses and states setting aside CDC mitigation procedures opening despite consequences.  And of course, those consequences are now moving onto the radar.  As far as the markets showing a positive face despite all the dire news; markets show the health of wealth inside a bubble impervious to just about any societal disassembly."
2020-06-05 14:59:13,"Woe has come to me as I peer at an approaching storm. The farmer, focused solely on the dismal state of the stores in the squalored, burgeoning barn, has forced the flock from its shelter to forage upon weeds sprouting between hard-scrabbled, spit slickened rock, despite the distant roars of thunder, and the blinding, exploding cracks of pain."

2020-06-05 15:01:43,"Beware the paper jobs, particularly in the restaurant and hospitality sector, that are an artifice of Paycheck Protection Loan requirements. A restaurant for which my wife worked occasional shifts sent out notices to all employees, full and part time, threatening loss of unemployment benefits if they did not return to work, simultaneously instructing managers to place ALL on full 40 hour a week schedules, which very few had ever seen before. This employer and likely many others are crash-gaming the system to meet Paycheck Protection loan forgiveness requirements with paper employment that is unsustainable if that program is not continued. The shifts at this particular restaurant undoubtedly will melt away once the loan is forgiven and the restaurant's normal abusive practice of aiming to keep most employees dangling part time resumes at an even lower level of employment given that most potential customers are still wary of the virus. May's ""hiring rebound"" may well be simply a sign that the Paycheck Protection program is working somewhat as intended, with fraudulence and cynicism that is to be expected, not that the economy is recovering rapidly."
2020-06-05 15:01:48,"What we need to pay attention to is the rise in minority unemployment.  What have they got to lose is an appropriate question and the answer may be not much, but when one has nothing to lose is when one becomes very very dangerous.
It has been obvious for decades that the chasm between those who have and those who don’t has grown ever wider and more reflective of racial discrimination.   Civil unrest may just be the outer rings of a social hurricane."
2020-06-05 15:02:36,"How many people are no longer getting unemployment and thus not represented in these numbers?  How many are now part-time employees and not represented in these numbers? 
 How many went back to work in the states that re-opened outside of CDC guidelines?  And, of course, with Trump, how much did his minions massage the numbers?"
2020-06-05 15:03:28,"Basically, some auto workers went back to work and are playing catchup. They are still going to produce far less 2020 models, far less 2021 models, and so forth. 2019 was the new high water mark and it wasn't that high. It will probably be at least 5 years to get back to 2019 auto production levels."
2020-06-05 15:06:14,"Wait for it. There will be a second wave. Whether it will be worse than the first, who knows. But with all the nice weather returning, people will be packing the beaches, outdoor BBQs, and all the fun things we do in summer time. Add to that hundreds of thousand protesters marching in the streets and it will definitely be defined as the double whammy of the pandemic. 

This is not my hope. But it certainly a tangible event given the history. I had been furloughed for about 4 weeks. I am concerned as I am now back at work and seeing patients. I am very careful and using all the protocols put in place. Do I feel safe? Not with what is happening around this nation. 

They can open up whatever they want. I am not going to risk it. If I et the virus it would be a death sentence for me. So no, I am not going to patronize any establishments for at least a year. My life will be get up, go to work, go home and repeat. 

I know if I am put out of work again I will be in as much trouble as most Americans are. I empathize with them. I used up all my savings for this last one. But there is no way that unemployment is going to cover the cost of rent should round two put us back into a shelter in scenario. 

I am so done with America. No one here is happy about anything. With the current leadership (or precisely the lack of) no one is going to be happy again. This pResident has pretty much destroyed America. I see nothing great in it anymore."

What I do not know is what percentage of the total these might be.  Glad to see people being able to go back to work if they want to."

2020-06-05 15:11:28,"America is rising again like a rocket! The unfortunate overreaction of the economic shutdown will soon be nothing but a bad memory. But sadly some businesses will not survive the months of loss, and many people will remain unemployed for some time. We can only hope that children who lost several months of education and social interaction at their most impressionable age will not be permanently hurt by it."
2020-06-05 15:14:00,"My understanding is that the reduction in unemployment is because 2.7 million reacquired their jobs after temporary layoff.  The number of permanent job losses increased by about 300 thousand. Context is Everything, surely."
2020-06-05 15:14:35,"I would hope that the reporting of these numbers have been verified as to me, they don't add up.  How is it that there are nearly 30 million unemployed but the unemployment rate went down?  Given how Trump mandates government agencies to make him look good usually through lying, I really do question these numbers.  And if they are true, and the result of the PPP, which will expire soon, then they are just a temporary blip and nothing more.

I don't expect the economy rebounding any time soon."
2020-06-05 15:15:58,This is good news. No doubt about it. Let's hope it continues.
2020-06-05 15:16:08,"Please help me get over my initial take.

Now that unemployment has become a central issue in the election coming in Nov.; why would we believe government stats that might make or break Trump?

Have I become so wary and sanguine as to doubt all manipulable media reports originating in gov data? If Trump can control the US Weather Service why not the Dept. of Labor?

And what indeed does ""work"" mean here as others have urged a clearcut definition? The numbers may be evanescent and more palapable to a news weary public, but the lasting power is iffy at best. Too many other parameters show it's no more than a flash in the pan. Maybe stocks will respond but the bottom line is the breadbasket."
2020-06-05 15:16:42,"I am not surprised t all I doubt the unemployment rate would remain at 14% but sorry it won't be 5%  and anytime soon.  The final 3-4% point will take time. We will probably go to 7% in the summer then it will slow taking a year to drop below 4%.

Meanwhile our deficits are truly exploding out of control under Mr. Trump. The next President will have to reign in spending or raise taxes or both. Personally the Democrats will provide American with a better and more balanced deal."
2020-06-05 15:17:14,"So basically if you look at that chart, we have the same number of jobs as Dec 2011 instead of Sept 2010. That is good, but we are still down 9 years of job growth or roughly 20 million jobs. As we peaked at 160 million jobs that is 12.5% plus the low of 3.5% unemployment or a real rate of 16% unemployment. The BLS number is lower (13.3%) because as usual they just decide that certain people will never work again and don't count them."
2020-06-05 15:18:12,"Not all that surprising.  Internet sales are up and companies such as Amazon have been hiring.  So are businesses such as Domino's pizza, that need delivery people.  Question is, the quality of the jobs."
2020-06-05 15:18:58,"The problem as explained to me was American statistics are very vague in their interpretation insofar as employment is determined by anyone that spends any number of hours working at a job regardless of its nature(i.e.full time/contract/part-time etc.etc.).  There is no breakdown as to wages earned either.  The largest number of people by far, that lost jobs, were in the service industries that, for the most part,  were probably those that were hired back on a part-time basis which makes up much of that type of employment anyway.

I would be more interested in statistics to show the total number of  people in America that are actually employed in full time jobs with benefits(i. e. with health insurance coverage).  

The LA TImes ran an article a couple of years ago when one digs deeper into the statistics and realize the number of people perceived as employed, yet, under the poverty level,
the actual unemployment or ""underemployed"" rate at any given time is 17%, not the 3 and a half or 4%  the government keeps touting. This is confirmed by the fact that almost 50% of employed people, at any given time, couldn't come up with an extra $500 to cover emergencies."
2020-06-05 15:20:26,"Even with the assumption the administration didn't use every method to fudge the numbers, the rate only dropping 1.5% is nothing to celebrate. With this administration's modus operandi to harm individuals to make itself look good on paper, we should assume it didn't just come up with new reasons to exclude people from the numbers, you should expect to find out it just flat out lied and the unemployment rate is much higher than being reported."
2020-06-05 15:20:48,"Good.
Except: how good are the jobs?
Also except: since Trump has called past unemployment numbers fake, how do we know that these aren't?

So , when the PPP funds run dry will these workers lose their jobs as a result.

Seems to me that a more complete analysis is needed."
2020-06-05 15:21:27,The present drop in unemployment has to be seen with back drop to all ready job less numbers due to Covid19. It dropped to 30% or so and now as lockdown relaxed those who laid off are regaining jobs.
2020-06-05 15:25:01,"Did the   economy actually gain  2.5 million  jobs, or were these the same jobs that were available due to unemployment and/or furlough. Aren't employers bringing back the same people they let go in the first place?"
2020-06-05 15:25:10,"It seems to me that there will be less unemployment in June also, I am driving early in the mornings and see a large increase in traffic within the last week."
2020-06-05 15:25:36,I'm surprised that everyone is surprised by this unemployment report. The period between the April and May jobs surveys was when the PPP money began to flow and businesses began to restore payrolls. In the coming months we'll begin to sort out the temporary layoffs from the permanent job losses.
2020-06-05 15:25:59,"The Times ,of course prefers to exaggerate the misbegotten ,the protest rioters burning down and smashing the stores of wage earners and taxpayers who spent years building businesses .These persons ,to use the word generously ,obviously do not work.some may be looting to support their stimulous payment from the government they despise. Granted,the quarantine cost jobs but that is not a fault of the President but the actions deserve a greater praise for preventing a worse catastrophe. On the progressive front there are millions whos wages have not been lost ,tech employees and thousands of banking jobs working from home,their production increased and expenses commuting to work decreased .Many workers I know have never had it better and the stocks are earning more than ever.You can dwell on the poor woe begotten all yet for the most  part they've created their own foul existence playing the political victim card and begging for government compensation."
2020-06-05 15:26:03,"It appears the country is about to test two new progressive postulates. One economic, ""Destroying businesses benefits minority workers,"" and a social one, "" De-funding the police will benefit Black neighborhoods.""

The latter predisposes that reducing police presence in black neighborhoods will create more harmony and safety. And that newly freed up funds will be spent wisely.  The BLM goal is to reduce unarmed black deaths by police from a tragic 9 in 2019 to 0 in 2021. Nothing less is likely to be acceptable. Reducing police services is either a brilliant strategy or one that will cause additional grief to black neighborhood residents.They shall see.

Resistance by the right is unnecessary if the concern is non-black neighborhood safety. There is sufficient large city law enforcement to both free up social spending money and to maintain police services in non-black neighborhoods.

Progressive leaders see this as necessary risk taking. For decades large city leaders have failed Blacks in housing, healthcare and education. Shifting the blame to law enforcement may work if by de-funding the police new spending on social issues positively affects poor Blacks. They shall see."
2020-06-05 15:26:24,"As has been common for over seven years, a near-minimum wage worker has the freedom to leave any job and move to another near-minimum wage job as often as they like. Technically, the activities they perform can be called ""work"". Practically speaking, the activities are closer to enslavement. 

Ironically, it is precisely this part of the employment marketplace that is driving the bounce in the stock market. If the reverse were happening and $100k+ executives were getting hired, the stock market wouldn't have budged."
2020-06-05 15:27:23,"I don't believe these figures as we know over 40 million have filled claims fro unemployment.  The Dept. of Labor states that non farm payrolls went from 150 million to 130 million and has now risen to 132 million.  There's 20 million people that got lost in the numbers somewhere.  Are these the self employed who were never counted in the first place?  These are people who pay quarterly taxes.    One would have to assume that those 20 million went back to work during this time for the numbers to work out.

Anyway, let's assume the government figures are correct.  This means we have already bottomed out.  Hooray for us!  Trump is now touting this as some kind of victory.  It's all over and 13% unemployment is now a wonderful thing.  Tell that to the 13%.

The Republican Senators will now use this data as proof that no more financial assistance is needed.  Tell that to the millions of small businesses who will permanently close.  Tell that to the thousands of towns, counties and states who are going broke.

Furthermore, if the numbers have been skewed as I believe they have, going forward as the PPP expires, we should see only modest gains in unemployment.  The odds are then quite good that unemployment will come in at over 10% by Nov.  Trump will call that a victory."
2020-06-05 15:27:31,"All of the ""experts"" predicted dire unemployment numbers except for one.  Donald Trump.  He predicted, correctly, that the numbers would fall.  It's great to have a leader who understands economics."
2020-06-05 15:28:01,"As many have noted, ""employed"" includes the people who have reduced hours.   That's the quintessential ""reopened"" business: running at a quarter capacity, with reduced hours for everyone.   But there's no accounting of ""sort of employed/sort of not""."

Another fine gaslighting of the american people. 

How much richer did the billionaires get when the FED pumped in money to the economy?"
2020-06-05 15:31:38,"I think the numbers have been underreported from the start, and these new number may be nothing more than a way to keep the markets from panicking.  And to give Trump something resembling positive news.  And yeah, I'm more than a little cynical when it comes to this recovery."
2020-06-05 15:32:17,"Where I live, there is just as much traffic on the roads as before the pandemic. I’m not surprised at the good job numbers. The economy was very strong before and will quickly pick up where it left off. Good news."
2020-06-05 15:35:34,"Is anyone else prepared to contemplate the possibility that the data may have been falsified?

Yes, I have reached that point.  Federal statistics were the last bastion of truth, and in this administration, you wouldn't expect that to continue."

2020-06-05 15:39:12,"The often critical media called it a shocker that 2-1/2 million jobs were added.
Not a single critical voice is heard in the country, has journalism capitalized?
Did no journalists wonder about this seemingly miracle number?
When corporations restarted their business, happily following Trumps orders, but way too early to feel safe covid-19 wise, demanded their workers to come back to work, no matter if all safety regulations for covid-19 were put in place. The business leaders also threatened to inform their city government when they refused so they could stop the workers unemployment checks, no matter of the workers didn’t feel safe yet.
This was nothing but a Trump style threat to workers.
Another threat was hidden in emergency government loans to smaller businesses which included a rule that the money can ONLY be used for pay-checks to their workers. That forced small business owners to call back their workers, even if there was no work for them to do as the economy had stopped. These workers had to forgo on their    unemployment checks and put back to work where there was no work or safety and could be back on the streets pretty soon with no guaranteed unemployment checks.
Come on News media, don’t act so surprised, do you job and explain why this number is a number obtained by threats to workers, happily executed by businesses."
2020-06-05 15:43:59,Economists were wrong.  Shocking.  People are upset at good news.  Shocking.  People want to go back to work.  Shocking.  The lockdown was bad for business and for personal earnings.  Shocking.
2020-06-05 15:45:22,"Without actually being in something like hospitality you can sort of call this what it is.   Shallow.  Like Trump and the shallow nature of the business world he represents.   Hospitality, entertainment, restaurant, for God's sake gaming....
All the couple of points up mean really nothing in the long term.  The American economy is still sinking.    Give up the propaganda.  Reagan used this type of thing quite successfully, at the expense of the majority of Americans.
Now where is that ""Beautiful Infrastructure"" ""the bankrupt one"" promised us?"
2020-06-05 15:46:21,"It does sound too good to be true, doesn't it?

I hope it is true, but based on everything I've learned about Donald Trump, I believe it would be prudent to scrutinize this report and make sure that the books weren't cooked.

If it is true, I worry about an earlier than forecast resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic.  We're just starting to notice a small uptick in the number of new cases that cannot be explained away as the result of more testing.

And who exactly got these jobs back? We lost 1.8 but gained 2.7 or whatever - sure OK everything is back to normal no virus or protest. Carry on - market 30K DJIA here we come."

2020-06-05 15:50:47,"Unemployment is measured by number of applicants for unemployment insurance. Millions of out-of-work former employees are ineligible for unemployment insurance, many more than in ordinary times, but they go uncounted. The number of claims may also be down because state systems are overwhelmed, so those with blocked and pended claims may also go uncounted. In other words, these DoL numbers are unreliable."
2020-06-05 15:52:37,"The data is really suspect though isn't it. How do you tie out 43MM state reported unemployment filings, representing 25% of the available workforce, added to the under-employed, those who've left the workforce by BLS definition. The real data will show up in a couple months when PP disappears, as unemployment filings continue. BLS changed their input compilation decades ago to obfuscate the data."
2020-06-05 15:53:19,"We won't know what the economy really looks like until we see how many people are furloughed and how many are laid off permanently. This was a good number.

2020-06-05 15:54:05,"I don't believe these numbers at all.  In fact, I don't believe in the unemployment calculations by the BLS in general, and I never have.  They don't match up with other numbers.

I've always considered the BLS corrupt.  The reason being is that they don't track foreign employment for US companies at all, and since there's no correlation betwen employment by country vs. sales by country demanded in our economic policies, it's just another corruption cooked up by China.  How it invades the BLS is not clear.  Sometimes this sort of thing happens through osmosis if ideas that stem from a desceptive agenda created by foreign interests and US industry profiteers.

It's all designed to keep the low end of the job market in the dark about the reality of their oppressive economy."

I sent an email and they told me someone would be in touch but it will take a while. I don’t think I’m being counted and I wonder how many others aren’t being counted as well."

I mean, how do we really know if these numbers are even true with how many times Trump and his buddies have lied to us over the last 3 and 1/2 years?  I'm still out of work as is everyone I know. We need more financial help not another photo op from this administration. And where is Congress? Not doing its jobs, as usual, thanks to McConnell and the Republicans who care only about themselves. I can't wait to vote in November."

2020-06-05 15:57:28,"Workers may be returning to work but are they making the same amount of money?  Many businesses are still operating on reduced hours - retail, restaurants,etc.  And what happens to those workers who got COVID-19 “hazard” pay - do they now return to their regular hourly rate?  
At this stage, businesses have not had time to figure out the true cost of re-opening, they just wanted the doors open.  Once they get a minute to breath, they’ll be able to calculate the cost of doing business in our new “normal”.  This will probably include an evaluation of staffing.  

Another number to watch go forward - consumer prices.  Some clothing basics had seen an increase prior to COVID-19.  The new cost of doing business will most likely be passed along to consumers."
2020-06-05 15:36:52,"There is a caveat on the interpretation of these numbers. My hairdresser explained to me that she and her colleagues were able to draw unemployment until the day the salon reopened, at a 25% capacity. Only a small fraction of the professionals can work. The staff who are not yet working will not be drawing unemployment. To the extent that these numbers are based on unemployment claims they tell an incomplete story."
2020-06-05 15:59:51,"Surely economists will have explanations for how their forecasts were so dramatically wrong, and I expect that to a large extent they will make sense.

But what bothers me is how they could have missed all those mitigating factors in the first place. What is the point of economic forecasts if one has to spend most of his/her time explaining why last month's forecasts were totally off the mark?

I  particularly look forward to Professor Krugman's next column, after he has had time to digest this report."
2020-06-05 16:00:53,"Hey journalists - why is it surprising that unemployment went down when half the country started going back to work in May. It'll go down again in June. I'm telling you now so you're not surprised.

Trump has still made everything worse than it's needed to be."

Seems as if that possibility and their truth about some reporting issues  is not newsworthy?

2020-06-05 16:09:40,"Not a surprise.  The payroll protection program was the impetuous for the surge of re hiring.  Companies that where successful in obtaining the loans from the SBA brought staff back on board, even though work volume did not warrant it, in order to gain loan forgiveness.  When the loan amount is exhausted, companies will have to make some tough decisions.  Our company will have to begin letting employees go and those employees will go back on unemployment putting further pressure on state unemployment funds. With sales down 30-40% compared to last years fiscal year to date revenues, we have no other choice.  Many of our peers in the same industry are in the same boat.  We can only hope the economy gains some steam but I have my doubts."

2020-06-05 16:12:31,"I do not believe these numbers.

We just had 40 million people applying for unemployment.

Even if there were 2 million hires, that leaves 38 million people without work.

Therefore, the numbers appear to have been cooked.

With the Trump administration, you cannot believe anything they say, so why put any credence in this set of numbers?"

“…Primary dealers are trading counterparties of the New York Fed in its implementation of monetary policy. They are also expected to make markets for the New York Fed on behalf of its official accountholders as needed, and to bid on a pro-rata basis in all Treasury auctions at reasonably competitive prices….”

The following footnote appears on each report in the “Weekly Release of Primary Dealer Positions, Transactions, and Financing -- Government Securities Dealer Statistics Unit, Federal Reserve Bank of New York”:
“…2. These reports are based on data voluntarily submitted by primary dealers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) pursuant to forms and instructions available at: <a href=""http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers.html</a>. FRBNY expects primary dealers to submit accurate data, but FRBNY does not itself audit the data….”

What I do find shocking is how my personal retirement account has been going up because of huge added liquidity by the fed.  My actual business is hanging on by a thread because of the paycheck protection program.  

I'm not an economist but the disconnect between actual productive economic activity driving assets prices and liquidity driving assets prices seems like another huge bubble is being created that might not end well?

But I am afraid that many of those jobs did not pay well to provide a real livelihood. Otherwise, we would not have seen so many people lining up to get free groceries when the pandemic started. They would have savings to get them through the economic shock. Looking around the world, the scenes of people lining up for free groceries are quite unique to the so-called richest county on the earth. It was sad and painful to watch indeed."
2020-06-05 16:19:52,"When the unemployment rate was 5% at the end of the Obama administration, Trump claimed it was FAKE. He repeatedly said the real figure was closer to 20 or 25%. What does he think it is now? Someone ask Trump or one of his spokespeople."

Trump did not cause COVID-19. In fact, we would have lost even more jobs under the perfect hypothetical Democratic president because this Democratic president would have locked us down longer. Trump encouraged the economy to open faster than it should have. So, indirectly, Trump created jobs. Either way, whoever was president would have been blamed for making the wrong decision: lockidown or economy?"

The PPP money took hold in May and States outside of the hard hit New York Metropolitan area began to reopen. June numbers will show a even better decline as more and more States reopen and the number and type of business allowed to open expands. It is going to be long slog and tough for many but the country and people will adapt, are adapting.

2020-06-05 14:46:49,"It would be so refreshing if the NYT would report on economic metrics that are actually relevant to every day people. A drop in unemployment % could mean people have simply given up trying to be employed or have run out of benefits but not necessarily hired anywhere. A net increase in jobs says nothing about the quality of those jobs: minimum wage? contractor? part-time? benefits? And giving so much coverage to ups and downs in the stock market has zero meaning to the vast majority of Americans, I suspect the vast majority of your readership as well. How about NYT, you throw out these dinosaur metrics for the economy and start reporting on wage growth, % of jobs created with a living wage and/or benefits, number of people who have left the workforce because they've given up the hope of ever being employed again and things of this nature? And stop reporting as if the stock market has anything to do with the real economy for real people."

It should be talking about the complexities of the economy that will lead to a prolonged downturn.

This good news report demonstrates that our economy is strong, and was damaged only by government action related to suppressing covid-19, not fundamentals.

Trump had nothing to do with the markets or unemployment -- all he had to do was stay out of the way and let economic forces operate.

What wasn't taken away in the jobs report was the reality of what the index of aggregate hours worked is telling us about Q2 real GDP. As in -- down 46% at an annual rate. That's a deep hole to climb out of.

At the end of this year we can tally up the dead, near dead and the poor. Just pray you are not among them. Your odds are much worse than they were before Trump took office."

BINGO. You have servers on payroll for $2/hr but no customers providing the tips that are the real source of server income.

Every week in May the weekly new unemployment number was in the millions and now we created jobs in May and the rate went down?!?!  The only explanation is that the unemployment rate was calculated differently for May compared to April which is exactly what happened according to the BLS when Covid 19 related unemployed are counted as out of the work force. This new accounting will be used from May to October ....  Coincidence ?

Forecasts were for 8 million jobs to be lost in the US in May.  Most of them would have been absorbed by the least able to afford being unemployed.  Instead we gained 2.5 million jobs, which is a blistering clip even though obviously these are jobs that used to exist only a few months ago!  A lot of joy to be had and misery averted.  This is also a strong indicator that we've hit the bottom and an indicator of a potential V shaped recovery even though I believe most economists are still projecting a much more painful U shaped recovery.  Add to this the fact that the savings rate in the US is at an all time high, which I think means pent up demand as things start to reopen and the fact that it seems like people are reluctantly coming around to the notion that we can't hide under the bed forever with various state governors starting to realize that if they keep the economy closed much longer they're going to go bankrupt and people will hold them accountable.  All of this is great news for all of us who have to work for a living.

Also not whoopee material is the fact—the fact, okay?—is that in the stupider countries that are taking Trump’s stupid approach, COVID-19 cases continue to climb. This “return to prosperity,” codswallop is coming, in the classic Trump fashion, by shoving the big lumps under the furniture and the dust under the rug. 

It’s the same with the Federal debt, race relations, the environment, infrastructure: the big boys grab, the debts (and not just of money) go flying up, the poor and the old snd the workers and the farmers and the sick and the unlucky—and the dark-skinned—can go hang, and the clock ticks. 

Over a hundred thousand dead in this country already; count on that doubling. Anywhere from a quarter to a third of the deaths were avoidable.

These numbers may be true, but then again, they could just be another in a series of many, many lies from this WH."

2020-06-05 16:32:16,"Happy but yet sad.  The truth is this will be a roller coaster.  Unemployment will go back up and when state and local governments need to balance their budgets and lay off civil servants including Police and Fire personnel.  If we relied on one piece of information, then Trump can get re-elected but it does not work that way.  Hunger, joblessness takes it's time to show up in this current economy.  We need to brace ourselves for what is coming. Service industries will suffer the most and take the longest to recover.  The Stock market only affects a small percentage of this country and as mentioned in one article in the NY times, the Market has no moral compass and is all about profit.  Profit from loans that are now adding to the nation's debt.  Be a Scout. Be Prepared for the worst but expect the best."
2020-06-05 16:32:35,"Looking at economies comparable to the U.S.A., Germany unemployment rate was 3.5% in January and it is now at 5%.  In France unemployment was 8.1% in January and it is now 8.7%.
Even considering the  euro-area (27 country 342.37 million people )as a whole , unemployment was 7. 4% in January and it is  7.3%  in May.  It has to be said that different approaches were taken to confront  the same event , but numbers are numbers ,regardless of  PPP or other form of intervention chosen by other countries. It will be interesting to keep an eye on average hourly wages variation in the weeks and months to come, especially on the group of people in the U.S.A. which have continued to experience  a rise in unemployment in spite of   the  recent somehow comforting aggregate datas. 
Finally,  U.S. employment rate dropped from 61% in February to 52.8% in May, another interesting trajectory  to observe in the months to come considering the absence of effective measures for childcare support due to cuts to state parks and recreation programs."

2020-06-05 16:30:23,"Note to the editor: the charts ""Percent change in jobs from previous month, by industry"" are incredibly misleading. 

Each month should not revert back to 0% as the baseline. As you show the data here, it appears job growth in May overcame the losses in April, plus X%. This is not true. Job growth in May added X% from the baseline of losses in April. There is still a net job loss since March in each of these industries. 

This is an astounding error that I would be reprimanded for in my position in local budgeting. In fact if I submitted these charts to show these trends, I would be accused of intentionally misleading the public."
2020-06-05 16:13:50,The headline in pretty misleading. Jobless claims going down is not a surprise to anyone except the NYT. Where do they think that PPP money that Congress passed went to? We’ll really find out how resilient the economy is once that money runs out. In the meantime the economy is like that kid working part time and living rent free in his parents house and declaring that he is financially independent. The real test is yet to come.

2020-06-05 16:37:39,They can tweak the numbers any which way to make things look good for Humpty Trumpty . So he's got good economic numbers for his re-election.

I think that some rise should definitely be there, in line with the European nations opening their economies. But this is definitely not rosy, and that the stock market rose on the ""news"" shows how much money the gov. has put in the financial sector that is sloshing around there. It is no barometer of anything. The financial sector has long ceased to represent the real economy. It is a rentseekers paradise, hooked to the infinite resources of the Fed Reserve."

If the non farm payrolls are about 133,000,000 and you multiply 13.3% of that number you get the number of unemployed at 17,689,000.

But the number of our fellow citizens filing for unemployment insurance claims over the past couple of months are over 40 million.

Can someone explain to me and my fellow citizens how the unemployment rate is at 13.3%?

Has Trump cooked the books?"

2020-06-05 16:58:04,"This  can serve society.  This pandemic showed too many live at subsistence or near subsistence levels.  By not giving them more economic power i.e. justice, history will repeat itself.

The Federal Government, contrary to retro conservatives views, is everyone's employer.  Money enters circulation from one source, the US Treasury via the Federal Reserve.  There should be enough dollars in circulation, distributed equitably.  The worker, professional, government officials,or corporate leadership's gain should come second to assuring decent survival.

Decent survival encompases several critical needs.  Health Insurance, Housing, Nutrition, Education, and Security.  Too much largesse goes to those who have more than adquate funds.  They don't spend it, creating inequities at all levels. 

A friend asked me why can't they keep these idle millions or billions.  The answer is clear.  If they along with other Americans want a safe, prosperous country, this pandemic has shown what happens when contributing citizens are shortchanged.  

The answer has been charity or a piecemeal government programs.  People do appreciate help. However dignity and self worth suffers. When gainfully employed, adequate spending power brings rightful pridee.

2020-06-05 17:04:37,"This only demonstrates the serious limitations of the ""unemployment rate."" People stop being counted as unemployed not just due to getting jobs but from being unemployed longer than their benefits last. And adding temporary delivery jobs does not replace permanent, well-paying jobs that are lost or are going unfilled."
2020-06-05 17:06:59,"Trump's response to the surprising figures:  ""Really Big Jobs Report.  Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!""

Typically, he claimed NO responsibility for the horrible numbers in the past couple of months, delivered a mixed message (mostly negative) regarding the riots following the killing of George Floyd, but oh boy - good financial news?  He takes complete credit.  

And forget the fact that the unemployed still haven't recovered financially - the MARKET is going insane! which only helps those wealthy enough to participate.  

Look, I'm glad that people are going back to work, but I'm still concerned about the possibility of a return of the virus.  Let's proceed with caution."
2020-06-05 17:08:53,Do I believe the numbers? I am not sure. Historically the BLS has been staffed by non-partisan professionals but much has changed over the past four years and even good individuals could simply be delivering the news that is being demanded.
2020-06-05 17:09:32,"The problem is that these are Labor Department numbers and I no longer trust these agencies to be independent. The Trump administration has so filled departments with sycophants and yes men willing to say anything the boss wants and which casts him in a good light prior to re-election, such that anything they report is now suspect. I am reminded of the glowing production numbers released by collectivized agriculture farms  in Mao's China during the Cultural Revolution; glowing numbers that looked great on paper,  when in reality, that nation was in the worst famine in modern recorded history. Bottom line, thanks to Trump, I no longer trust anything I hear from him or his administration."
2020-06-05 17:10:15,"Without the House PPP you’d have the George Lloyd protests PLUS hungry, homeless otherwise middle class folk marching Over the barricades. Have you ever heard of the spark that began the American Revolution? It was the refusal to be held hostage by a tyrant. Instead of King George we have the man whose name is an anathema to liberty. The US Military will refuse orders to be deployed against US citizens in any peaceful political actions they may take up to and including property damage on public city streets. If human lives become victim to violent demonstrations they will consult with local authorities in a hierarchical manner from governor on down. At no point will OUR Generals, Admirals, and other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff partake in politics, political demonstrations, or actions against US citizens for whom they took the Oaths of their Services.
I do not pray but I sure hope I’m correct. I spoke what I was taught from about age 8 forward.
In th midst of today’s chaos, our President has only made bad worse. He has done literally the least, refused Federal leadership on CVirus, the financial CVirus crisis, George Lloyd’s lynching by knee, you name it, point for point, OUR President has left the citizens of the US to fend for themselves at the State level. Except when it comes to military deployments within our boundaries. He’d love to give shoot to kill orders. I personally hope HE remains frightened."

2020-06-05 16:35:03,"At my 25 people small business, the PPP program was just what the doctor ordered.  It covered my employees through tough months, and now we're back open.  Currently, we're realizing roughly 70% of our weekly revenue forecasts, but we see a full recovery and everyone's jobs are safe.  As a matter of fact, we plan on hiring more people at the end of August.  

The Trump Administration has done a fantastic job with the economic recovery.  I'm not a big Trump fan, but I truly appreciate and am grateful for his leadership during these past months. He's got my vote come November."

2020-06-05 17:25:23,It was to be expected that jobs would return after States began opening up. This together with the stimulus explains what I am sure is an aberration. We will not know the full damage until a month after Phase 4  of reopening begins.

I think my repairman is a better barometer of the economy."

2020-06-05 17:34:58,"We are missing 20 million people from the totals which terribly skews the numbers. Here is where they went.  All figures sourced from the Washington Post.

1) 2.5 million counted as employed because of the PPP.
 
2) Several million who are laid off but expect to be called back someday.  That pushes the figure to 16.3%.  They are still out of work.

3) 6 million working part time who want full time jobs.  They most likely picked up something to get by with after they got laid off.

4) 6 million who are not actively looking for work because of the virus.

Add all these numbers up and you get to the missing 20 million.

The economists who were predicting 20% (40 million unemployed were right all along.  The weekly jobless claims agree with 40 million losing their jobs.  

This is a snow job where the official numbers are correct but they don't tell the entire story as the methodology used hides the real truth."
2020-06-05 17:35:48,"When the Obama/Biden administration came to office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. 
 Unemployment was about  10.0% in October 2009 through November 2010. The Obama/Biden administration brought it down to 4.7% in 2016 and it continued to fall until their economic policies were replaced with Trumps. Trump took office with unemployment at 4.7% and is celebrating it is only a little over 13%. His mishandling of the corona virus response caused businesses to close and working people to lose their jobs and savings. We need Biden back to fix this economy."

2020-06-05 17:12:27,"I don't trust any jobs numbers put out by the Trump administration. He's a lying desperate criminal with no soul.

Today in a rambling speech where he was gloating over the jobs numbers is actually said:

 ""Hopefully George is looking down and saying this is a great thing happening for our country"" then he added ""A great day for him and a great day for everybody""

It is not a great day for George Floyd. His days ended when he was murdered in the gutter by a cop that should get the death penalty.

I am physically ill. I don't think I can control myself from spitting in the face of anyone that can still support Donald J Trump. He's using the death of this poor man for a cheap sound bite.

Most times people in the field of employment stats  are more interested in U6 rate as the more meaningful rate because it covers a larger percentage of people who are unemployed. That means the U-6 rate is much truer to a natural, non-technical understanding of what it means to be unemployed. That rate is 21.20% with the new correction of +2 million people employed as latest figure.

Trump was repulsed by the horrific knee video and one of the first to condemn the unnecessary death of Mr. Floyd.  He directed the FBI and DOJ to act quickly to bring justice.   In addition, he has pardoned several African-Americans where he believed that the justice system had been too heavy handed.  He saved American students in China from very lengthy jail times.  Trump’s economy has resulted in criminals leaving prison finding employment outside and making fresh starts with their lives.  He recorded the lowest unemployment numbers for all people of color in our entire history.  

Biden advocates for shooting armed attackers in the legs and local governments issue plans to defund our first responders.  These are not real solutions to anything.

The Fed and now the US Government has assured these few that, their bets, no matter how risky and ill-reasoned, eventually, will be covered if they go south, by a myriad of so-called financial instruments.  ""Financial instruments"" is fancy language for printing money so the Fed, and those appointed by the Fed, can buy plays gone bad, made by said few, so they don't sink the stock market.

In other words, the apparent bump in employment is, in our case, probably just a postponement.

And with regard to Wall Street's over-reaction, I said it before, and I will say it again...

I imagine Wall Street is a person... 

...we would discern their behavior was erratic, inconsistent, and unreliable.

So, it would therefore be unwise of us to depend on them unless or until they seek support to learn to better mind, manage and guide their behaviors and actions. 

Perhaps we should begin to re-imagine, reorient, and re-calibrate how this nation ""manages"" - and perceives - its entire economic system? 

Perhaps we should step ""outside the box"" of our paradigms, perceptions, and beliefs about our economy...so we can view data accurately, comprehensively, and perhaps even with skepticism.

That way we can live day-to-day grounded in our economic reality, as challenging as that may be, and we can cultivate a recovery - an economy - that supports us now...and far into the future.

Why else would the biggest mall operator in the United States, Simon Property Group, sue the largest specialty retailer in the United States (Gap) for nearly $66 million in unpaid rent for April, May and June, according to a lawsuit filed in Delaware this week?

Gap does BILLIONS in sales, so a measly $66 million should be pocket change, right?  (Hint: they must not be doing quite so well. Or they think they can claim ""force majeure"" and stiff the landlord.)

Wait and see what happens to people and REITs (real estate investment trusts) who own office towers (that we now know are somewhat superfluous if people work from home).  There will be many businesses that save an absolute ton of rent money by having people work from home.

I expect that there will be plenty of ""neutron"" office buildings (from neutron bombs, that use radiation to kill people, but leave structures undisturbed).  That is going to have a major effect on the building trades as well.

And then there will be a major hit to travel and hospitality from losses in business travel.  Why waste a lot of time, and spend a lot of money, for a short meeting, especially an ordinary one, that can as easily be conducted over the internet?

First, ADP Jobs Report released on Wednesday showed a LOSS of 2.5 million jobs.  Unless we added 5 million government jobs, it doesn't seem possible for there to be such a big spread between Gov. stats and ADP, covering roughly the same time frame.

Second, this jobs report covers through May 15 which was before restaurants, etc. reopened, so how could restaurant restarts have any effect at all?

Third, in January the government had to restate 2019 jobs reports to eliminate 1.5 million jobs.  At the risk of sounding like I'm wearing a tin hat, me thinks something is rotten in Washington."

Also, since the Trump administration has taken no real, systemic action to rein in the coronavirus, the apparent economic rebound may collapse once the virus reasserts itself.  Trump is still banking on covid's magical disappearance, but if that doesn't happen, all bets are off.  

Doubtless pundits will bicker about what ""caused"" the resurgence -- lax local guidelines, or big street protests -- but the central problem has always been Trump's inability and unwillingness to coordinate a national effort to control the virus.  That failure will reverberate for many months to come."
2020-06-05 18:34:47,"Behold, the latest display of Trump’s mental illness.


Press:       But how do you handle the law enforcement part of this?


Trump:      Well, I think you have to get better than what they’re doing. I mean obviously that was a terrible thing. And I’ve spoken about it numerous times in various speeches. And you know, it’s interesting. I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket. A tremendous program that culminated on that day. And obviously it goes on from there. But I then made a speech and it was a speech about the rocket. And I devoted 25 percent probably to what happened. Or more. To what happened with respect to George. George. Floyd. And it was. And then you listen to the news. He doesn’t talk about George Floyd. The rocket went off, I then made a speech. And I talked about George Floyd. But then they said he didn’t talk about George Floyd. Half, maybe even half of the speech. But a large portion of the speech was devoted exactly to that. And so you know, with the media. With the media, you basically. Basically no matter what you do, it’s never going to be good enough. But the people understand it."
2020-06-05 18:34:51,"So Mr. Trump is over the moon about unemployment figures and the 900+ points jump in the Dow. Looks like his beloved market is behaving just as he wants it.
   Let's juxtapose these statistics with some others a bit more sobering: New covid cases in US since yesterday: 21,000. Second only to Brazil's of 28,000. US deaths increase from covid over the past 24 hours: 1070. Again, second only to Brazil's number of 1380. Third place in both cases is way down from these two world leaders.
   I see no cause for rejoicing over these economic triumphs. Mr. Trump still has the covid crisis on his hands where he's much to blame for our numbers due to his inept mishandling of the crisis up until now.
   I fear his policy of reopening the economy again to be way premature. We have not in the least tamed the covid beast. 
   I want him gone, even if (God willing!) our able researchers  find a vaccine against covid and get it out to the world's citizenry post haste.  
   I'll rejoice only when (again God willing)  the Nov. 3 election results send Mr. Trump a-packing, thereby demonstrating that the US electorate has somewhat recovered its senses."
2020-06-05 18:40:14,"Check the COVID footnote referencing a change in methodology in calculating the unemployment rate this month.  If the same methodology is not used month over month the results reported are of no use since they do no reflect any change in any direction with respect to last month.  It would appear that, just as he did in Real Estate, Mr. Trump has again cooked the books."
2020-06-05 18:46:53,"I understand the sentiment of the unemployment comparison by race. I think it is a bit misleading to not include select groups, such as Asians.

2020-06-05 18:58:52,"How can this be a surprise? Every state is in the process of reopening and people are returning to work. It figures to improve for the near future. Then it will hit a wall as the enormously important experience economy (sports, entertainment, tourism) remain truncated. Likewise, an increase in employment may not correspond equally with an increase in consumer demand. No one knows how that will go. Borrowing trillions of dollars to backstop the pandemic collapse is exactly what the federal government did not do in 1929 and hopefully it will prevent the devastation of the Great Depression. John Maynard Keynes would certainly approve, but this news should certainly not be a surprise."

Over the last ten weeks we amassed a total of 40 million unemployment claims, with roughly 25 million currently remaining on unemployment. Last week we reported an additional ~1.8 million who filed for unemployment.  We still have 20 million Americans out of work and an unemployment rate in excess of 14% (even if we find that these recent numbers prove to be accurate)."

The PPP is running out soon ... then what ?  Covid-19 is still highly contagious with no vaccine yet and most people will not travel till they can rest assured that someone who is asymptomatic won’t infect them with Covid-19.

One solution might be to fire the Economists who make lousy
predictions, as the damage they to is incalculable.

If you lose jobs because you are forced to stay home and your job is put on hold, it is only common sense that when you go back to work the unemployment will drop.

2020-06-05 20:07:15,"The pandemic messes with jobs data. According to Heidi Shierholz, former Chief Economist at the U.S. Dept. of Labor:

""Roughly a fifth (6.6 million) of those out of work because of the virus are being counted as having dropped out of the labor force. This is because jobless people are only counted as unemployed if they are actively seeking work, which remains impossible for many. If all the 32.5 million workers who are out of work as a result of the virus had shown up as unemployed, the unemployment rate would have been 19.7% in May instead of 13.3%.""

This is being used as justification for the White House and Senate to walk away from another package. Entirely predictable."

2020-06-05 17:58:46,"Here is a statistic for you. Oxfam has now reported that 2,135 billionaires now control 60% of all wealth on the planet.

2,135 billionaires have as much wealth as 4.6 billion people. (Not the poorest 4.6 billion, but 4.6 billion average humans.)

Are 2,2135 people really as productive 4,600,000,000 people?

22 billionaires have as much wealth as ALL women in Africa.
Are 22 people more productive than 510,000,000 people?

Money that you have, but didn't create through your own productivity is STOLEN.

Using your position in finance to siphon off the wealth of millions of people is not 'wealth creation.' Manipulating markets and governments to grow and pop bubbles faster than the rest of us can react is not productivity. It creates no real wealth.

The real 'redistribution of wealth' is not the Congressional responsibility to tax trade to invest in the General welfare.
The real 'redistribution' is the redistribution of the most people's productivity into the bank accounts of global billionaires, who also happen to own controlling shares in all mass news.

If you are a small business owner or small farmer consider this.
If you own a small business or farm, you probably have a few million dollars in capital. You are a millionaire. A billionaire is worth a thousand millionaires. 

Is a billionaire really 1,000 times more productive than a small business person or farmer?

How much interest and fees are these global billionaires charging you? Why?

2020-06-05 20:30:31,"As many others have commented, the PPP has skewed these results.  What may be overlooked is that when these businesses open, workers often have to choose between risking their health (or perhaps lives) and that of their families, or losing their income.  Unemployment will not longer be available when they have the ""option"" to work.  These workers may be grateful to have a job in the short term, but they are not celebrating.  The stress is unbelievable.  Maybe some businesses will be able to survive.  Many will not.  But the GOP will use this as an excuse to deny any further help for those who are struggling."

2020-06-05 13:38:28,"I worked in the technological us of data, so believe  me when I say: ""Torture the data long enough and it will confess to anything.""

The headline figures do not show the full picture. A broader measure of unemployment which counts workers who have given up looking for a job and part-time workers who are seeking full-time employment paints an even bleaker picture of the situation. The measure – known as U6 – was 7% in February before the pandemic hit the US. Last month it was 21.2%. 

The BLS report notes that as was the case the previous two months, ""there was a large number"" of workers who were misclassified as employed even though they were absent from work.

""As was the case in March and April, household survey interviewers were instructed to classify employed persons absent from work due to coronavirus-related business closures as unemployed on temporary layoff. However, it is apparent that not all such workers were so classified,"" the report said.

If they were classified correctly, the overall unemployment rate should have been about three percentage points higher, the report said.

That translates to U-3 being exactly where it was last month.

Getting paid for now, is not ""working.""  Let's have a look:

1) $349bn in payroll protection (payable whether employees are working or not, as long as they are kept on payroll). 
2) Median personal income ~$34k/yr
3) 24 wks of PPP ~ $15,700
4) $349bn/$15,700 ~22 million jobs paid w/PPP

Why? Our industry is undergoing a lot of change, with some areas stagnant and others growing. Our company happens to be very good at the part that is growing, and our business increased during the pandemic.  More importantly, the company has stopped off-shoring and moved thousands of jobs back to the US, as their research shows the higher labor costs are off-set by higher quality and efficiency. More companies should do the same."
2020-06-05 14:40:35,Trump gives himself sole credit for the May job creation because he signed the two major incentive bills that were created through bipartisan negotiation with considerable pressure from Democrats to include funds for small businesses that were able to rehire many of their workers.

The numbers appear cooked to me. When we have 42 million people filing for unemployment insurance, and now we are told 2 million of them got jobs, that still leaves about 40 million looking for UI (and for work). In a total labor force of about 160 million, 40 million is 25%.

So where did about 20 million people who were looking for unemployment insurance disappear to? That is what it takes to get down to 13% (about half of 25%).

THAT is the question.  Were those UI filings false?  Or did somebody mess up a few numbers?  To get down to 20 million unemployed (still a whopping big number) you have to account for 20 million OTHER people.

Here is what BLS is telling us:
For the second straight month, BLS said some workers who should have been marked as unemployed and on temporary layoff were instead counted as employed. It estimated that if these workers had been correctly categorized, the jobless rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher, or more than 16 percent.

So at best the numbers are strange, and at worst they are total nonsense.

If they think that someone can survive on simply an unemployment check they are insane and out of touch.  

If they think people can pay for their healthcare because last year they made too much money for free services but now they are making nothing, guess what, healthcare is too expensive. 

If they think that people don't go back to work because they don't want to, they clearly haven't spent 3 months in a tiny space with their whole family, including children who they have desperately been trying to home school with mixed successs.  

If they think that the jobs people had before this are going to be waiting for them to come back, they are unrealistic.  

Who are these Senators - can we get a list of all of those - Republican or Democrat that is opposed to another stimulus package because we should vote out anyone who is up for election and the rest - call their offices every day (everyone that is unemployed, the 30-40M people) yes, each day one phone call per person to any Senator saying ""lets wait and see"" to explain to them why we need another stimulus package.

A supplement to the Current Population Survey - the source of the unemployment report that Trump touts - includes the following comment:

""12. Household survey: How many more workers should have been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff in May?..........In May 2020, 5.4 million people were included in the “other reasons” category—about two-thirds of the total 8.4 million employed people not at work during the survey reference week (not seasonally adjusted). This is lower than the 8.1 million people not at work for “other reasons” in April, but was substantially higher than the average of 549,000 for May in recent years. As in April, BLS analysis of the underlying data suggests that this group included workers affected by the pandemic response who should have been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff....""

It is directed at dismantling our rights, any other protection we have, regulations to protect our health and our country's resources.  The Democrats have their group of people who ignore their constituents too.  

We have reached the point where our government at almost every level, is unresponsive to our needs as citizens.  We pay these people's salaries.  We give them plenty of perks to aid them in accomplishing their jobs.  They, the GOP in particular, have repaid us by destroying as much of the working class (most of us) as possible.

2020-06-05 14:13:56,"Our federal education department is stealing public school funding to support private Christian schools while localities are left to make up the funding- these same people in charge are also against national standards and national testing so they can hide the results of their efforts.  

The pandemic accelerates the disparity.  Those with more stable homes have better outcomes.   Access to healthcare, affordable housing, living wages and quality education all go hand in hand-  we have to do more than tax breaks for the wealthy.

A lot of people would be wise to hold their kids back a year."
2020-06-05 14:56:17,Dear Educators: So what should happen next? Should everyone stand-down and restart school in two years (after a vaccine) right where we were in Last school year? Will some kids her to take the next level math class (cause they advanced during the pandemic) but stay with their current home room or history class?  What the next step to get everyone back on track ? And what about student athletes?  Thanks for your responses
2020-06-05 16:05:10,"I’m an elementary special education resource teacher in Southern Oregon. I spent the whole shut-down doing 1:1 Zoom lessons with my students, usually 8-9 sessions a day, and then parent support/planning meetings at the end of the day. I’m really sick of Zoom. A few of the students, that have excellent family support, were able to maintain their skills, but a vast majority of them lost ground week by week.  For students with special needs, I found online learning very substandard. We need to find a way to get students safely back in schools!"
2020-06-05 17:12:12,"I’ve never understood the rationale of landlords.  They’ll raise the rent on a good tenant, the tenant moves out, and then they collect $0 rent for years waiting for a rent increase that in no way makes up for their losses.  It doesn’t add up.

Now?  And this is true in both residential and commercial properties— there is no next tenant.  You evict the tenant you have, however understandably behind they may be, that’s it.  You’re looking at years of vacancy.

A reasonable business person recognizes forces beyond their control and adapts.  Landlords are being unreasonable if they think they are going to be the only person in the chain who doesn’t have to suffer.

Do the right thing.  Talk to your tenants, work something out and expect a lower income for a while until conditions improve.

Next stop, your bank.  You’ll be more empowered in some states than others.

It’s less, or nothing, for now."
2020-06-05 17:57:18,"Tax landlords more for an empty property, than a property occupied by a tenant. 

This encourages renting, and a tenant running a business drives economic activity."
2020-06-05 18:06:13,"We're in an unprecedented situation at the moment.  No one has ever experienced the kind of economic freefall we're all about to experience.  It would be wise for landlords not to expect the same amount of rent they received before the pandemic lockdown.

It's unrealistic to expect tenants who have received very little financial support from this administration, or who haven't yet received their promised financial assistance to find a way to pay what will now be considered exorbitant rent.

Everyone needs to work together to renegotiate a rental amount that works for both parties."
2020-06-05 19:24:00,I’m a doctor in NYC and thus fortunate enough to still have a salary. I looked at paying my rent as a form of personal and civil duty to keep the economy from sliding into greater disrepair and chaos. I guess I should have been thinking like a soulless billion dollar corporation.
2020-06-05 20:28:07,Tenants and Landlords are in a pickle now. It is symbiotic. Paying rent when one has no income or savings is risky because health and food expenses loom large too. If a tenant withholds rent which is a daring brinksmanship move he usually has the right to cure his default during the judgment and eviction process. Most landlords will relent in the process of eviction if the rent starts to flow again from the delinquent tenant. Especially since ease of finding a new tenant at the same rate is in question.
2020-06-05 20:28:30,"As a long time homeschooler whose family members went on to university, I suggest it's the idea that teaching a classroom of kids with a one size fits all curriculum  that will fail many students who are now at home.   

Whereas a good homeschool curriculum geared to the child will succeed. Since this allows the child to learn at their own pace, and even spend a whole day on just math, science, reading, writing etc. 

It also helps if a child has parents who are hands on and enthusiastic about learning and able to incorporate everyday hands on learning using cooking, doing laundry, being outside for math, science, reading education.  

To  many parents don't want to actually parent, but expect others,  be it childcare providers, and teachers to parent their child."

Initially, all the 'googleheads' and other internet geeks (who always benefit when more online activity occurs) were saying ""Oh, don't worry, virtual learning is just as good as being there.""  Well, we know that is not true. And, it is becoming more and more clear that the blue states overreacted to the pandemic by closing everything down, especially the schools. An inordinate amount of mortality occurred in nursing homes, especially in NY, where the governor was perhaps unduly focused on ventilators, instead of protecting the elderly and frail. So looking back (which is easy to do) we could have kept schools open (the risk to the young is extremely low), and we would not be in the position presently with our students being behind the eight ball. Of course, the other side of the equation is that, other than Sweden, most countries are in the same boat.
Looking ahead, if these protests do not create large spikes in virus spread, then it is a strong confirmation that we can open up sports stadiums with fans, concerts, and travel."

2020-06-05 14:42:29,"There never was any sound evidence that closing schools would have any effect on the epidemic. It was a horrible decision based on emotion and fear.Children are at very low risk of contracting the virus and the few that do almost always have minimal symptoms. I see that the Kawasaki disease hysteria has evaporated, so even that scare tactic has become stale.
The only reason schools remain shut is that Governors who have destroyed this school year will never admit that they made a horrible mistake. The shut downs and school closings lost any medical rationale weeks ago. Sweden looks more and more like what our model should have been.But as long as shut downs tanked the economy many blue state Governors have wanted to continue them - way beyond the duration that even the original proponents claimed was necessary. It appears that today’s job report has destroyed that strategy."

That aside, the most damaging aspect - and reprehensible if there was falsification or even just sophomoric error - is that it has played right into Trump's hands and gives him an Anti-Tank Missile to shoot into the waning credibility of science and scientists as a basis for policy, a key agenda item for him and the Republican Party.

Indeed whether it is deception or just error, Trump can and will  use it to secure for himself a couple of points in November, replace yet more real scientists and doctors now standing between us and oblivion, and if/when re-elected replace them all with charlatans who are in it only for career, money, and big Twitter and Facebook numbers.

Fortunately this one only gives Trump an Anti-Tank Missile and not another H-Bomb to add to the one he was handed by the CDC debacle.

This, along with a collective lack of patience for social distancing measures and most areas ""opening up"", led to many people concluding that the pandemic is behind us.  It is not.  

In my state of California, the number of COVID patients hospitalized and in the ICU is not significantly different than it was at its peak in late April.

I commented re the article on airlines not enforcing mask wearing that if businesses and customers don't adhere meticulously to social distancing measures, there will be a massive jump in hospital admissions, deaths and resource exhaustion in the fall."
2020-06-05 22:51:41,"The article, “Built for This, CDC Shows Flaws in Crisis” (front page, June 3) leaves out an important piece of recent history. Yes, the C.D.C. was unprepared for the current Coronavirus pandemic. But it wasn’t always this way. The United States government sponsored a nationwide public health system with a proud tradition going back to 1798. This abruptly came to an end in 1981 when President Ronald Reagan, in a shortsighted budget cut, closed all eight public health service hospitals and twenty-nine clinics. This compromised the medical care for underserved patients and halted the training of hundreds of young doctors and the careers of thousands of professionals dedicated to public health.

At that time, I was a commissioned officer assigned to the United States Public Health Service Hospital in Staten Island, New York. Like all the other uniformed personnel, I was available to respond to health emergencies anywhere. For example, when the order came from Washington, I was sent to Arkansas to take care of Cuban refugees from the Mariel boat lift. Furthermore, my research in infectious diseases conducted at the Public Health Service Hospital, was published in a prestigious peer reviewed medical journal. In contrast, President Donald Trump relies on anecdotal reports about Coronavirus treatment which are misleading and dangerous."
2020-06-05 22:52:03,"Too many people have equated the shutdowns w/eradication of CV19-that was never the intent.  The intent was to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system.  Eradication is completely different & nearly impossible-this virus is from the same virus family responsible for the common cold, let's not forget, for which there is not only no vaccine, but no cure.  This virus will be around for a long, long time to come & was around much earlier than many suspected.  The more testing that is done, the more positives there will be but it is important to remember being positive for the virus doesn't always means the person is 'sick'.  The metric to follow is number of new hospitalizations which shows the capacity of the healthcare system, not how many new positive results there were on any given day.  It would be nice if the media finally figured this out-might help tamp down some of the panic that is more widespread in this country than the virus at this point."
2020-06-05 23:14:52,"I do not understand why increasing numbers in the South is news when decreasing numbers elsewhere is not.  Weren't the numbers in the South expected to increase?   We need to know where and why findings are much better as well as where they are worse.  For instance, a report today from western PA related striking good news about number of hospital cases, discharges, deaths and positive tests.  We need to know that progress is occurring.   I believe that continuous bad news on this subject tends to numb our attention and may promote less adherence to safety measures we should be taking."
2020-06-05 23:25:45,"Donald Trump has learned nothing. Not only is he rushing the reopening of the economy, he cannot resist insulting governors and local leaders who are trying to move more cautiously. Realizing that his approval ratings are very low, Trump is betting that a resurgence of the COV19 will not manifest itself until after the November election, giving him the slim hope of making voters in a few swing states believe that he has been right.

It all about photo ops and ignoring the stress put on many hospitals without enough protective gear, reliable testing and ICU beds. Republicans have a tradition of short-changing the Public Service Corps, by being deficit hawks on matters of healthcare, while having unlimited deep pockets to shell out tax dollars for corporate welfare."

When the lockdowns were lifted the week of May 11, 2 weeks later a spike in cases.  Wow, where did that come from I wonder?

Two things, either the Arizona Health department is run by people who know nothing about this virus, or they are aware the dangers of this virus and they just don't care.  I'm not quite sure which one is worse.

But its okay because even if  it spread the disease the Cause justifies the means.  On the positive side, I did note that most of the individuals participating in the rioting did seem to have face masks on.

It looks to me that a lot of people (and in particular elected leaders )have forgotten what they learned long ago about infectious diseases and what they witnessed recently about the coronavirus infectious disease. This amnesia  leads to people thinking the virus is going away or becoming weaker or never existed in the first place. So wake up folks. Infectious diseases are passed from person to person. This particular disease kills and if it doesn't kill it can cause all sorts of long term medical complications. True many people who get infected get a mild case. The problem is you can't be certain who will get what kind of case. Socially distance, wear a mask. Don't slip into amnesia."
2020-06-05 20:55:49,"Business owners have limited, if any, income. Sure, there is a no-eviction law and postponement of rent for now, but the debt just accrues. MANY small businesses cannot pay that and are already out of business. They still technically owe that money.

Landlords, usually in better financial positions (although not always, like the small landlord; NOT TRUMP or Kushner, those grifters) are also accruing debt with restricted income. They owe taxes (you can be sure that Trump will not play them), must spend on upkeep and maintain a minimal staff for maintenance).

With all this debt piling up upon the backs of renters with no equity, what will happen to them? Trump will never bail them out - he'll only give OUR money to his rich Republican supporters, as he its doing now. I'm sure there are loopholes there that will keep them off the hook - Trump is an expert at that and tax evasion.

Pretty soon you'll see massive bankruptcies (many more than even now) and little-to-no RE market except from people like Mnuchin (check out IndyMac Bank and the post-2008 foreclosures of residential properties) - that's his MO and he is Trump's right-hand financial guy.

Give us FACTS not these ghost story articles that ""suggest"".

What are the actual numbers of new infecteds, vs those who recover vs those who actually die.

Glad we are required to wear face masks in stores (even though I hate wearing one) and that reopening is being done in careful stages and that we have seen no uptick in cases.

The only way COVID-19 will be beaten will be if we acquire herd immunity or there is a vaccine very soon and immunize all the adults above 55, those with a weaker than normal immune system and front line health care workers. In the mean time business as usual with travel overseas restrictions, school closing and all the safety precautions currently in place including safe distancing. Schools and Universities could remain closed until September depending on progress in beating the virus or availability of a protective vaccine for immunizing the general public. A company in India is claiming to have 1 billion vaccine units in a month or two and so does Astra Zeneca claim to have 5 billion units about the same time. 

Iceland, Sweden and Japan have done better in handling COVID-19 by taking all precautions without closing any business. The fatality rate of Sweden has been higher than their neighbors but their percent population of people who have passed average life span is higher than most of the world."
2020-06-06 01:20:02,"Education is a available to those who seek it.  Public schools require you to get an education whether you are motivated or not.  Our children could read before they entered public school. We taught them reading and math at home in addition to their public school education.  During the Pandemic I my in laws are  having their kids read and write daily, and checking their work.  When a family is motivated they will supplement public education.

As for access to computers, if a family can afford cigarettes, a video game machine, or an iPhone, it can I think  likely afford a humble computer: perhaps a chrome book.  Education need not be expensive.  

I think  the reality is that families that highly value education find it.  Many people do not put a high value on education and that is a choice that has consequences."

I almost cried. 
What is it going to take to teach these people that this is a huge mistake with coronavirus cases still rising? 
We have been been blessed with relatively low cases here but we do have nearly 50 people in quarantine in our county with a recent case reported to have come from a person who attended a large church service. The local health department announced online and in the newspaper that anyone who attended this service needs to contact the health department immediately. They obviously don't have a handle on this yet. 
I get so frustrated, as do others, that many seem to completely ignore this crisis. 
I'd like to leave my home someday. I'd like to feel free to grocery shop again someday or get gasoline without treating it like a hazmat experience. Most of all, I'd love to see my kids and grandchildren again someday. 
I'm going to start complaining to local officials on Monday about their city celebration. It won't make any difference but at least I can share what I think is right about this.

Will the spikes -- if any -- be greater in places chosen by large crowds of protesters?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
If cases spike upward,
then that will demonstrate protester social irresponsibility.
If cases do not spike upward,
then that will demonstrate that social distancing
-- at least when outdoors -- 
is not required to prevent transmission,

not to mention political rallies and conventions.
We will see.

If Trump hadn't politicized the virus,  and especially wearing a mask,  we wouldn't have nearly as many cases and deaths. If Trump hadn't enabled places like Tyson Foods to force workers back to work with very little changes to those work places, there wouldn't be concentrated outbreaks associated with meat packing plants across the mid-west.

If he doesn't worry for his own safety and life he could, at the very least pretend to care about Americans who are suffering because of him and his party.

If the GOP cares about Americans it's hard to tell.  Is it care when someone like McConnell says the states should file for bankruptcy?  Is it love for Americans when the GOP run Senate doesn't want to extend any benefits on the grounds that they believe that people don't want to work because they're lazy? More like people are afraid of getting sick in a country that doesn't guarantee them access to medical care when they need it but only when they can afford it unless they don't mind their credit rating being ruined.

The fatality rate of Sweden has been higher than their neighbors but their percent population of people who have passed average life span is higher than most of the world.”

Before we pat Sweden “on the back”, here is a different point of view.  Sweden now has among the highest per capita death rates from Covid-19 in the world. Why?
Sweden was lax in its implementation of protective measures in the face of the outbreak, refusing to implement broad stay at home orders for residents, or to enforce recommendations to wear masks or social distancing measures. Other than the government decision to shut down universities and high schools, compliance to public health recommendations was entirely voluntary. 
Early on Sweden was proud of their exceptionalism. Outside the country, many voiced their praise of Sweden’s “common sense” approach, which they wagered would be less economically destructive than stricter measures and would not lead to any greater number of deaths.
They were wrong.

Until now most Swedes have backed their country's approach to the coronavirus pandemic. But as the death toll has catapulted Sweden into the ranks of the worst-hit countries, people are beginning to balk."

Or might it be simply that people are getting out more - and mixing - and breathing.

Lifting restrictions is bound to increase the infection rate compared to stay-at-home. How could it not? The only strategy is to monitor that effect and to react if it becomes dangerous. This cannot happen if politically convenient platitudes about increased testing and blaming protests are trotted out to mask the problem. Spin and fake news will kill Americans."

We have seen what caused Mr. Floyd’s death. It would seem that allowing the private medical examiner, funeral personnel, how many others...to remain ignorant of the virus results is just one more incident of negligence, disregard for the ....life...of others. Incredible."

Russia, in contrast, is definitely hiding their COVID problem. They are fudging their mortality statistics and as a result their COVID death rate is an order of magnitude less than any other country. Good luck to the Russian people who are the victims of Putin's despotic behavior yet again.

Hypocracy and scape goating on clear display. Do any of us have the courrage to vote out these politicians that directly aided and abetter the creation of our current situation?

So, now we are likely to see another spike in C19 cases in our cities due to the selective application of our constitutional rights by these career politicians.  Their campaign pandering to maintain their decades long grip on our largest cities is followed by feet of clay inaction leading to and institutionalizing the policing problems we have today.

Those who were going to get sick or die probably did already, and we're susceptible to it because of genetics, and most importantly, age. The pandemic is over. This is now just another virus, like the flu that we will live with. Protect the elderly and, especially, the nursing homes. But the looting is as much from the psychological and economic damage caused by endless lockdowns as from a horrendous murder by police.

Masks, gloves and good hygiene combine to save lives, period. Every healthcare worker, public official and grocery store clerk should be given as many disposable masks of high-quality as they need to get through a day. Businesses and restaurants are supposed to be reopening in America? Those workers all need access to whatever type of masks they feel comfortable and secure with. While homemade scarves can be colorful and entertaining, the virus is not distracted by bright colors and clever designs￼. These solutions are better than nothing, but still inferior. For unclear reasons, there is an inept inability to produce billions of these masks to meet demand. Masks that are widely available are of inconsistent quality and possess a far lesser filtering ability than the clinically superior N95￼. The N95 itself is subject to price gouging, widespread fraud and fakery. Governments should all be providing virtually unlimited quantities for free by now.

Everyday you had the scoreboards prominently displayed of new cases and deaths and than you didn't. Now the media thinks it has something more harmful to Trump, we have the protesters. Think Russian collusion replaced by Mueller.  The protesters are a double edge sword because watching rioting and looting is revving up the Trump base and unfortunately it is  terrifying senior citizens.  As many others have noted where are the stories about the protesters spreading the virus, because clearly they are deliberately violating all social distancing protocol and it is folly to pretend they are not spreading the disease.  Evidently it is okay to spread a deadly disease as long as politically you are supporting the Cause.  The Cause even trumps (no pun intended) a global pandemic.  Not covering these stories isn't going to make them go way.  Can you imagine the stories that would be run if Trump was having his supporters protest in the streets and violate social distancing the hyperbole would reach epic proportions."

Who is really behind the Giuliani purchase of so much stock in Novartis, a key maker of the drug?

Were there conversation between Trump and Bolsonaro about pushing it's use, since Bolsonaro is a protege of Trump?

In watching video of the protests I have found it remarkable how many ARE wearing masks. They're probably carrying hand sanitizer. It's struck me as amazing that in the midst of their civil disobedience, most are still abiding by the rules of the health directives. The message is ""we're mad but we're not stupid.""

2020-06-04 14:30:09,"Until a week ago, one thing dominated writing in this newspaper: the corona virus. There’s a pandemic, and the only way to mitigate its effects was with draconian lockdowns, stay at  home mandates, and the collapse of the global economy. Public gatherings were illegal; people with “non essential” jobs could not work, health care was put on hold; religious observance was virtually outlawed. Anyone who disagreed was said to have little concern for human life, was a fool, or worse.

In the opinion of many, the lockdowns had done their job of slowing the pandemic, flattening the curve, and it was time to slowly and carefully lift the sanctions. However, until a week ago, the NY Times disagreed.

Then, in a heartbeat, things changed. A horrible murder in Minneapolis occurred, and there was (understandable) anger and rage. All memory of the pandemic and viral contagion seemingly vanished, and the Times printed editorials and countless columns touting the right of the public to hold mass protests. This right to protest is constitutionally protected, but this protection has always been balanced by public safety.

The fact that in most cities the protests degenerated into violent riots, which destroyed neighborhoods, ruined businesses large and small, and killed people did not temper the Times enthusiastic support of the right to protest en masse. 

Frankly, there’s something wrong with this picture.

We’ll see what happens to the Covid numbers in the US going forward."

20 or so people protest on the stairs at a state capital to reopen businesses and others attend churches to practice their religious beliefs are arrested for defying orders, but thousands can march in the streets, while other loot and burn churches and business,  for all the millions of people to see who silently will be voting in November."

International travelers should be quarantine for whatever time it takes to ensure the person is not sick or contagious.  If that be 14 days, so be it.  If testing can provide absolute assurance earlier, then let it be.

Some have argued that travel restrictions were impotent once the virus spread in the United States.  But how can we eradicate or control the virus if new entrants are allowed to keep importing the virus?

Heck, we almost forgot all about that -- didn't we?

The now once again rising rate of contagion suggests that even as the first wave begins to rise in newly-infected areas, a second wave is now appearing in previous ""hot spots"".

This was not unexpected even as it was fervently hoped that the lockdowns etc. could prevent it.

Whether or not some previously infected communities ""reopened"" to quickly is not the main issue.   Now, it is how do these ""second wave areas"" respond?

It is unwise to try and roll back the tape and simply return to the full lockdowns.  A full stop would be devastating to local, national and, ultimately, the global economies.

Hopefully, responsible leaders will work with the medical and scientific communities to refine and revise ""reopen"" methodologies to stem the rise in contagion.  

This ""second wave"" is a challenge for us to now wisely start to define what we lithely call ""the new normal"".  We need to be ""smart"" about this rather than simply display egotistical bravado and bluster."

They tell the police to stand down.  In Oregon, the National Guard was told not to carry and weapons of any manner if called to respond to the riots.

Even now the trend downward has begun to shift ever-so-slightly upward in the very latest statistics cataloging the number of newly-infected people by the coronavirus.

I would bet that we're beginning a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic that may exceed the severity of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

Now is not the time to attempt to resume your pre-pandemic lifestyle.  This wave may be more deadly than the first one.

Your job is not worth your life or the lives of those most dear to you."
2020-06-04 17:51:59,"If there was ever a time to re-prioritize life, now is that time. If there was ever a time to rethink our approach to caring for ourselves and the world around us, now is that time. If there was ever a time to think, deeply, about the meaning of life, democracy, and our place in the world, now is that time.

A pandemic.
An economic depression.
Racism's relentless presence in our law enforcemnt.
A societal breadown.

If there was ever a time to hit ""stop"" and restart from an entirely different basis, now is that time.

COVID-19 should be forcing us to make that time our time.

With or without Trump, that time will come, hopefully, millions won't have to pay for that right with their lives."
2020-06-04 17:55:06,"""On May 30, more new cases were reported in a single day worldwide than ever before: 134,064. The increase has been driven by emerging hot spots in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.""

But the ""smartest guy in the room"" stated just two months ago, on March 16th, that “The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus.” 

And yet in this country, people are being told to return to work or will lose their job if they stay home.

I fear that the number of new cases exploding around the world could occur once again in the States.  The fact that thousands and thousands of protesters gathered and marched for over a week, in close proximity, without wearing any protective wear such as a face mask, could  result in more new cases than imagined."
2020-06-04 19:05:03,"Not to detract from collecting data on economic status, race, sex, pre-existing health conditions of COVD-19 victims, but I would also like to know some other vital data such as: occupation (what were they doing?), lifestyle (family, single, sheltered?), recent activities (grocery store, dining at restaurant, attending a crowded event?). Not only should government and health officials be vitally interested in this data, citizens need it as well. Clearly we all have to make our own decisions about activities and contacts. We need this data to assess the level of risk entailed in various types of potential exposure."
2020-06-04 19:40:59,In our mediums sized  California country we had 40 Coronavirus cases 2 days ago. That number hadn't changed for almost a month. This morning we have 48 known cases. That is a 20% increase overnight.  I believe the decision by our county government to open back up is the cause of that since the area of the County with the 8 new cases is our vacation rental and 2nd home area at Lake Tahoe.  That area has 80% of our case while it has only 50% of our total population.

There is an active independent audit of data sources and production. Please don't conflate nuanced facts with speculative interpretation. We all are interested in more detail, but painting any areas of concern into a summation, at this point, is mediating outside messages that influence, at least, extremely questionable objectives. If you are sourcing coverage from the Guardian, please be more critical."
2020-06-04 20:34:52,"People, while I do not object to contact tracing, it would be at the most 50% helpful. People have no idea about the strangers they've encountered, and other people would not necessarily have remembered ""walking on X block of Y street on Z date and time,"" which is where an exchange of droplets might have occurred.  Even those visiting a particular location will run into others just before and after they enter the building, and most of the others may not remember if they had passed by that building at that particular day and time.  (I'm assuming general public notices about anonymous patients would have to be published, and not just ""known acquaintances"" of the patient.  Most of the places I visit every day are filled only with strangers to me!)

Regarding Cuomo's comment about civic duty, I agree with him, but that's because I have always thought that the only way to get better tracking on the disease is testing of EVERYONE, regardless of symptoms, and on a regular basis.  That I think is civic duty.  I do not consider it civic duty to stay at home if you've had Covid, have been tested positively for antibodies, and are not in a high-risk group."

The Little Eichmanns that toil and moil in the shadows dutifully remove them. It's like an ethnic cleansing. All signs of intelligence or original thoughts must be purged. This, of course, outs this banality and evil for exactly what it is.

Data collection means asking personal questions, getting in the personal spaces of people who don't trust the data collectors. Or where the data will be dispersed.

Look at how the Census was weaponized by Trump and his Band of deplorables! You think that by their loss of the citizenship Q, the message wasnt made clear to the demos they were seeking to find yet more leverage on to abuse and attack!?

Data, data, data. We're awash in it, but the Lords of Data want more! More data is not the answer!

FYI; we already know that black and Hispanic,and other brown peoples, Asians, etc, are being purposely disadvantaged by systemic racism. We already KNOW this! 
We also know that even poor, disenfranchised whites are swept up into that System. 

More data is useless until The System is turned around, basically eviscerated...and replaced by something different. More data for whom to review? The Repub dominated Senate? The Trump WH? The Lord and Angels of Data Deniers.

As posted to another recent NYT article, HC's cellular target is only relevant to Sars-Cov1 (which caused SARS), and is irrelevant to the infection by Sars-Cov2, which causes Covid-19.

There is no rationale to use HC in Covid-19!

Combined with HC's significant side effect of prolonged QT-interval, which can cause sudden cardiac death, it's frankly the last drug I would use in a disease such as Covid-19, which can cause Myocarditis and hence sudden cardiac death all on its own."

But it is not too late to do what should have been done at the outset: explain loudly to Black and Hispanic residents that they are especially susceptible to getting Covid-19 in a life threatening way. These groups, in particular, should take every precaution they can. Has anyone heard this message? I haven't. All I have heard is arguments that the disparate impact is somehow racist.

It's not. When the virus first broke out in China, the Chinese immediately reported that it was most lethal for anyone obese, diabetic, or with a compromised cardio-vascular system. The CDC has been reporting/warning for decades that Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately obese, diabetic, and prone to heart problems. So, obviously, these groups were most at risk all along. Why weren't they warned, singled out as especially at risk, and warned? Could it be that we are now so preoccupied with race that we can't even see our way clear to issue this warning?!"

2020-06-04 20:36:56,"The retraction of the Lancet study about the hydroxychloroquine comes with a surprise. Or maybe not, since there were big suspicions from various scientists around the globe on this study since its publication. The number of cases reported and the way it was analyzed was quite strange indeed and also, the timing it was published. It was way too fast. In the preprints from various groups at the BioRxiv and MedRxiv from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory CSH edition, several papers have also shown that the hydroxychloroquine is not effective, but not that harmful. I hope soon we can read more reliable scientific papers about the effect of this medication. In Brazil where I am, the president and also several people still believe that the hydroxychloroquine is the salvation of against the virus. People from my small company (Real Gramas) are urging for things to gets back to normal but we are not really believing that this medication is the salvation, but we are putting more hope in the Oxford University vaccine."

I went to the local medical center (affiliated with a very large academic medical system in a certain nearby city) yesterday for overdue bloodwork. It was not only the closest (as a single person) I'd been to anyone - the technician - in 3 months but all of the staff in the lobby, including folks screening patients coming in, stood/walked next to folks, even touched folks on the arm as they talked with them.  Is the rule now masks but no social distancing?  The local (but national chain) grocery store also removed its taped one-way arrows in the aisles, and some of the 6 ft taped markers.

We won't get close-to-accurate data for a year or two.  We'll get a decent draft by early 2021, but it will be only a draft.  The 1918 pandemic did not provide semi-accurate data for years because many countries did not attribute deaths to that flu.  Estimates had to be made.  COVID data, to be accurate, must use the same metrics for everyone submitting, and those metrics must be applied consistently.  That's not possible because applying the metrics is subjective.  So if we're expecting ""emperical"" data, we will be very disappointed.  The data will be estimates and will have a margin of error."

By the way, entire proprietary datasets containing confidential medical information are never handed over to a third party for verification.

Questions about data quality can be more easily answered by statistical runs and a de-identified sample of variables that Dr. Desai would no doubt be willing to provide.

Unmasked gatherings to protest the shutdown are silly, non-productive, always nonviolent and will increase infection rates.

2020-06-04 21:45:47,"It’s telling that hydroxychloroquine has become a political issue. It's supposed to demonstrate the irrationality of Trump, that there is no evidence that HCQ can prevent or treat Covid-19. Actually there is, for no less than four classes of reasons: a) Hydroxychloroquine is an immune moderator, that’s how it works against Lupus. The worst problem with COVID is a crazed immune system, overreacting. b) for other reasons, HCQ hinders the virus. The effects are modest, but strong enough to be used in comparison to developing therapeutics. c) HCQ has been demonstrated to reduce viral loads. d) In countries (Russia, India, Turkey) where HCQ is used massively, the death rates are spectacularly lower.
The Indian research body, ICMR uses it for the healthcare workers (HCWs) who are at an elevated risk of contracting Covid-19.

The ICMR study indicates that ""simply initiating HCQ prophylaxis did not reduce the odds of acquiring Covid-19 infection among HCWs. However, with the intake of four or more maintenance doses of HCQ, the protective effect started emerging. A significant reduction of about 80 per cent in the odds of Covid-19 infection in the HCWs was identified with the intake of six or more doses of HCQ prophylaxis. This dose-response relationship added strength to the study outcomes.""

It goes without saying that, if HCQ plus a macrolide (antiviral) antibiotic mitigates COVID, the biotech stocks are worth much less, and they trade indeed inversely to fake anti HCQ studies."

Bacterial pneumonia remains a significant threat. Less than 10% of COVID cultures in symptomatic patients have COVID. Positive cultures are not that common. These people presenting with cough and fever are as likely to have bacterial pneumonias as noncovid viruses and bacterial suoerinfection is common in patients with virus.
I have seen patients expectantly treated awating COVID culture. When that came back negative still nothing was done because of COVID fixation. Only when the patient got worse did somebody remember ""What did we do last year when we saw pneumonia on an Xray????""
We gave them antibiotics because half of the time it is a bacterial disease that will respond and 50:50 is actually good diagnostic accuracy if you do not have a post-mortum..
People have COVID fixation. Don't abandon years of experience, and stop writing headlines without thinking!
So far the delayed antibiotics seem to work. I know it could be timing, indeed by percentages there is a good chance the improvement is fortuitous but studies in the past showed that undiagnosed pneumonia did better on average with antibiotics and aas far as I can see there is no reason to jump ship."

In at least 70 cities across the country, simultaneous, massive demonstrations are taking place as we speak.  These events present a favorable environment for covid-19 spread and they come just a few days after Memorial Day, when many people abandoned infection precautions.

The first wave of infection hit coastal regions first and moved across the country sequentially.  But this time, many cities could well experience terrible case spikes all at once.  If hospital systems across the country are all stressed at the same time, we could face a disaster.  Regarding this prospect, we may hope for the best, but we need to prepare for the worst.

The Trump administration has not signaled any appreciation of what may be a catastrophic spike in cases in a few weeks. The coronavirus task force is doing essentially nothing right now, and the CDC has also been quiet.  The head of vaccine development for the task force has been told to suspend his activities.  

We all hope a terrible new wave of infections doesn't happen, but again, we need to prepare for that possibility.  Is our leadership up to the challenge this time?  So far it appears that the answer is no again."
2020-06-05 00:15:02,"The Lancet retraction of a retrospective paper has led to a lot of confusion, some sown deliberately.  The Times owes it to its readers to set the record straight.

The results of a large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study were published in the NJEM yesterday.  This is the first solid science on the topic, and it shows clearly that hydroxychloroquine (as studied) does not work against covid-19, full stop.

Earlier retrospective studies suggested a lack of efficacy and even increased risk of death.  One of the retrospective studies, which had been published in Lancet, was retracted by its authors because of doubts about the database they analyzed."

It shouldn't require a Ph.D. in microbiology to understand that biological enviornments that encourage a virus to spread and grow rapidly can be encouraged in a bacteriologically freindly enviornment.  

The use of antibiotics to help prevent the spreading growth of a deadly virus should absolutely be indicated and I applaud physicians who care enough about their patients to prescribe their use. 

And I resent the people who argue we all should  just suffer so we can make sure we don't speed up the process of these drug line's beginning to fade in their usefulness.

There is ALWAYS a constant, on-going race to develop new anti-biotoics to fight new bugs. And this may come as schock to many people, but there is a whole industry that has popped up to do this very work. 

And financially, they're doing just fine."

We still know almost nothing except cover eyes, nose mother-- and keep your hands away from your face.. unless they are very clean hands.

It is essential to give antibiotics when this situation is present.  Essential!!  We need to stop with our obsession about over-prescribing antibiotics and give them immediately whenever there's a need.  I have leukemia and have had it for 10 years.  My first oncologist warned me to take antibiotics immediately when certain symtoms appeared.  At some point, I got a sinus infection which I recognized early.  The internist's nurse would not give me antibiotics because I didn't meet her textbook checklist...I had to become Shirley McLane in Terms of Endearment to get her to call the prescription in.

Could it be that The Lancet is trying to beat the crowd in getting a scoop? I would expect better from that journal."
2020-06-05 03:15:00,"There is a certain irony in the Times reporting on the over-use of antibiotics.  First, the NIH had as a core mission over the past few years finding new therapies for drug resistant pathogens.  This has been a failure, even though well funded.  So calls for even more government funding to support “innovation” do not seem justified.  Price controls on drugs such as antibiotics, which the Times supports, have completely stultified the private sector in searching for new antibiotics.  The Times often takes these progressive positions, without actually looking at the impact these positions have.  But the Times often conflates science with politics.  Consider the leading stories and Op-Eds blasting Trump for promoting hydroxychloroquine (which he should not have done of course) based on negative studies in the Lancet and New England Journal.  Now that both these studies have been retracted because the data could not be verified, where is the correction from the Times and its columnists?  Crickets."

So, what is the price of this improved culling of the humans infesting the planet? Losing our aged populations of grandparents, along with their accumulated wisdom- making Republicans rejoice at the possibility of reducing their taxes as Medicare recipients are reduced. Killing off more and more lower income Americans that Republicans believe will lighten the load on social services, lunch programs, food stamps, emergency room health care, and welfare programs. Going to their graves are also creative artists, poets, musicians that Republicans see mostly to be bleeding heart liberals that support these programs to support the ‘lesser-than’, and in turn, reduce their taxes. Republican governors, for the most part, have no problem placing these ‘at risk’ populations in the deadly path of this pandemic. They choose to knowingly put in peril those they believe to be inferior to themselves- that’s the Republican way.

In addition Mr. Floyd had a 90% blockage of his right coronary artery. Total occlusion of this artery often produces complete heart block.

As this Newspaper has many times noted, some states are downright slovenly in reporting even the two most basic statistics: number of deaths that we know were caused by COVID-19, and total number of deaths (so that by checking against a similar time period a year ago, we can estimate how many excess deaths there were, often among people who should have been tested but weren't). Also as reported, some states falsify their testing reports by double counting testing on the same patient and other techniques. It does not surprise anybody that the worst offenders in both categories are Red states that eased restrictions before epidemiologists thought wise, and so don't want to look bad. Some of them have excess deaths OVER 50% of admitted COVID-19 deaths.

In the meantime, lie.

Fake news undermines serious media coverage and in turn makes it much more difficult for other journalists to report honestly on the truth.

Freedom of the press allows news media to report whatever they want but with freedom comes responsibility; responsibility involves not jumping to conclusions too quickly, especially when you are dealing with Donald Trump.  Those conclusions quickly echo off all walls and nothing else can be heard.  If nothing else can be heard nothing else can be believed."
2020-06-05 04:20:23,"I am one of the most endangered people in this country. Due to an ingested bacteria (salmonella) on spinach in a salad at one of America's finest restaurants in Rhode Island, I suffered congestive heart failure and a brief experience with death. I didn't know all leafy vegetables, especially imported ones, are subject to salmonella contamination. Twenty years later, complications from that poisoning include regular episodes of heart arrhythmia, diabetes, edema and lymphodema, and a propensity for blood clots of all types. One medicine, Tikosyn, used to prevent arrhythmia specifically prohibits the use of any antibiotics containing sulfa. Sulfa is a major component of the most effective antibiotics, so the only antibiotics I can take are strictly penicillin based. My edema often results in ruptures of the skin on my legs resulting in cellulitis, an infection best treated by an immediate prescription of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the most effective containing sulfa will interact with the Tikosyn resulting in complete heart failure. I always must be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotics since none of the oral treatments work. If these don't work, I could likely lose my legs and, if the infection reaches my heart or other critical organs, my life. The early over-prescrption of penicillin-based drugs were clearly responsible for this threat to my life. Now at age 70, I am a perfect candidate for death from Covid-19.

Why Politicized Science is Dangerous

Most interesting, table 2 was presenting  30 parameters for the 100.000 patients distributed in the 5 categories. There was unbelievable identities for these 30 parameters in the 5 groups, considering patients' files were collected all around the world.

The virus doesn’t discriminate on the basis of color. The causes of the varying impacts are the circumstances of the individual not the color of their skin.

Now that these studies have been retracted, will the Times offer an apology similar to the mea culpa over the Cotton Op-Ed?  It is also important to note that journals compete for impact ratings, which in turn allows them to charge higher rates for advertising.  There is no doubt that seeking publicity was a factor in the slip-shod peer review process, along with the fact that these journals are typically progressive in their viewpoints, so embarrassing Trump was a bonus.  Anyone who has published research in these journals (as I have as a researcher) are routinely asked to provide source documents that validate the data being reported during the review process - that this was overlooked here further suggests that these articles were rushed to print for political, not scientific reasons.

Entertainment consumption, or that which involves too much food and drinking, etc. The Covid19 shutdown showed how little most Americans needed to consume those products and services to get by. Which is now likely to carry forward, thereby ridding the markets of many jobs...and others to come."

The effects of Reagan's voodoo economics were not immediately apparent but the downhill trajectory started after he took office.  Now the most dreaded words in America are the ones being uttered by us because we know our government, as it stands now is not interested in helping out.  We say we need help and we're told to drop dead.  We can't get medical care without worrying about going bankrupt.  We can't afford decent housing because the only housing being built is luxury housing.  

Our entire society needs a deep cleaning/reconfiguration.  We have the wrong people in office.  We have let our own selfishness get in the way of creating a decent social safety net.  It's not the color of a person's skin that matters.  It's the person that matters, their hopes and dreams, what they make of themselves and all too often our policies have ensured that the poor stay poor and that anyone who loses a job after the age of 45 becomes poor.  

We don't value intelligence, hard work, family but we do value money to the point where we make foolish decisions about tax cuts.  We have low taxes and we have very little in the way of a quality social safety net.  You get what you pay for.  Wait until we start to find ourselves living in Hoovervilles."

2020-06-04 16:53:42,"Unfortunately, the ACA is in a sorry state, and will leave many now in health insurance trouble. 

Besides 9% uncovered in the U.S. now due to various ACA issues, there is a serious, less well known problem with much of the ""coverage"".

About 20% of U.S. ""coverage"" is actually some form of Medicaid.  Either ACA expanded Medicaid, or a pre-ACA Medicaid.

In many states, all Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are not really insurance, even though the Federal and state governments misrepresent them as insurance in their statistics.

They are subject to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily for a person, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.  It's a loan until death for medical expenses, not insurance, and people with this financial bomb often are unaware, due to inconspicuous notice by the relevant agencies.

The problem only exists in 10 or so states, like MA, NJ, and MD.

Some states fixed the problem, partly or completely, starting in main ACA provision year 2014, by amending their estate recovery policies.  E.g.: NY and CA.  (Making at least all ACA coverage real insurance.)

Come COVID,  there is a budget problem in CA, and the new budget proposes to undo the fix, which it did in 2017.  (See: <a href=""http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2020-21/pdf/Revised/BudgetSummary/HealthandHumanServices.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2020-21/pdf/Revised/BudgetSummary/HealthandHumanServices.pdf</a>.)

As long as our press continues its steady beat to narrow the scope through which we view these protests, the stock market will continue to rise.  

As long as we look at the surface and not the deep underpinnings of our inequality in this country, the stock market will continue to rise.

Until we look at the deep, two-tiered class system in this country that enables the systematic oppression and dehumanization of black people, of poor and economically disadvantaged people: things will not change fundamentally.  

This pandemic induced economic downturn laid bare for all to see that if you are among the wealthy elite you will be protected and heard in America.  Billionaires bailed out, small businesses left to fail or outright looted.

The message was clear: if you are black,brown, poor and working class white--you are on your own.  

As uncomfortable (and NECESSARY) as the discussions around race and police brutality are, this is a conversation that the corporatists are okay with us having, as long as we don't look at economic oppression.

Perhaps the beaches are cleaned more these days but I doubt that is the reason.

To stay alive at any cost, we will seek to decimate the population of a half a billion year old arthropod, which will in turn lead to reducing or decimating the population of migratory birds.

How does bleeding the crab affect it's life and reproductive cycle? 

In Europe, they are using the Factor C lab construct instead of crabs. Why do we think  European governments would ok something that might endanger their populations? Why not do the right thing and cause less harm to our environment and other species? After all every treatment for every disease we have now has side effects, why not go with a more ethical approach."
2020-06-04 18:46:39,"Very interesting article about endotoxins and the ecology of horseshoe crabs.

I'd like to know how in the process of making vaccines do they get contaminated with pathological bacteria?

They grow the virus on host or a culture because the virus is an obligate intracellular parasite, i.e., it needs a cell to grown.   Then they harvest the virus, and kill it or attenuate it to make a vaccine with antigenic qualities.

I don't know anything about the industrial process of vaccines.   But I am surprised that 1) bacteria can survive the process, and that 2) they absolutely need a horseshoe crab to test for them.

There is a limited use of synthetic blood in humans.   I am surprised in this age of biotech that they can't synthesize a humor from a horseshoe crab.  I realize that the elements of blood are very complex.   Hematology is a deep subject.   But still."

I may not be an anti-vaccine person, but I am disturbed at the thought that to keep me safe I must sacrifice an entire species, that too in a hard hearted way. Imagine bleeding the crabs then throwing them farther away in the ocean so you don’t pick the same one’s again. Many must be dead, or dying. Who knows how else we affect them. 

The covid vaccines in the end will all prove to be quite useless. Every scientist worth their salt knows this. The vaccine is the wrong way to approach this particular organism and in the midst of a pandemic. Why not give news space to drugs like EIDD 2188? Quite like remdesivir and rather exciting results.

It reminds me of when I was in the military - the locals in the town outside the front gate liked to complain about and criticize the unruly mob of Marines next door but the fact that most of the local businesses were driven by their paychecks seemed to escape them. It was brought home when the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) started to even hint about closing the base or relocating elements of it. Suddenly, those same critics said everything and everybody was essential. So, enjoy it while you can, but this well-dressed and quiet tourist will be back as soon as practicable.

Even before the pandemic many of these attractions were in disrepair and were crying for more funds.  So the locals can now enjoy these better now, but they can also enjoy the unemployment and loss of business. And the repairs will be delayed.

The second time was not enjoyable at all.  At the most popular sites, particularly Saint Peters, one could not walk around without being cut off or impeded by large groups of tour guide led tourists, mostly Asians.  They would follow the leader holding a pennant high in the air so the group could see their leader and not be separated.

With so many tourists, the Vatican provided no place to sit down, other than the side chapels where one could attend masses and ceremonies.   In the middle of Saint Peters, I spotted a low bleacher seating area, so I sat down to rest my feet.  And I turned around to find myself staring at the body of Pope John XXIII lying in repose in an illuminated glass coffin.

It would be nice to visit with no tourists, but with no tourists, how would I get in?   Reminds me of the Groucho Marx remark that he would never join any organization with standards so low that it would admit him as a member."

If you feel safe to fly but a 2-week quarantine awaits at both ends of the trip, no one will go. Similarly, if the destination is in some level of lockdown, there may be no point to going."
2020-06-03 13:52:24,"In order to ensure tourism can fully pick up, two things are essential. One is confidence that traveling by air will not spread the virus. The 500 person study is a good start. Second, that there is some confidence that travelers are not carrying the virus with them. This will require highly accurate testing and a way to capture test results for scrutiny. If there is a internationally recognized app that captures test results and can be scrutinized at airports, hotels, BnBs, etc., travelers can demonstrate their level of risk. If tested 7 days before travel, quarantines can be tailored to the length of time since the test. You can plan for staying the required number of days at your destination. Airlines will need to cooperate by offering flexible schedule changes to avoid carrying infectious travelers."
2020-06-03 14:07:56,"The only way I will return to air travel is when there is an effective vaccine or treatment, and when airlines demonstrate they will require and enforce mask wearing, social distancing and other best practices.

Until then I don't trust the airlines to behave in our best interests and I don't trust the flying public to behave properly.  I've seen too much evidence to the contrary in many years of extensive air travel."

I am 71 - and have been a traveler all my life.  Been to some 114 countries including Antarctica and North Korea.

I am prepared to travel again and stay in hotels - I have zero issues.

I lived in Indonesia during H1N1 and SARS - and traveled extensively within the country and outside.

Folks were wearing masks then but I never wore one.  Though kept my distance from the folks what we call social distancing today.

I think simple precautions like that go a long way.

I flew from Mumbai to Bogota where I live on Feb 26 when Wuhan was just beginning to make noise.

I washed my hands more times during that 22 hour flight via Amsterdam than I care to remember.

Folks are catching Wuhan from their own families - because they trust them as expected.

So, in traveling if proper precautions are taken - I would fly tomorrow.

Even before this year their continued enjoyment of it always surprised me a bit.  My daughter is 15 and i thought she would outgrow it years ago and yet she and her friends did not, and they have a lot of fun out there doing their head stands and wearing their goggles. We will put out the most basic of standard tents and they can sleep out there too this summer. She is eager for us to get it put up and we are happy to share it. Who could have predicted?"

I live in the desert of southeastern Washington state, where pools can be seen here and there, but just a few compared to southern California and similar year-round climates.

I've been told that a swimming pool doesn't really add much to the value of a house, I guess due to maintenance, repairs, a finite lifespan. But today, hah, a friend of mine has had an in-ground pool for 20+ years, which his kids and now grandkids always enjoyed. But today I complimented him on being a savvy investor those 20 years ago. Also sort of echoes the home-built bomb shelter craze of the 1950s."
2020-06-03 13:57:49,"I was trolling our local Costco for a pool a month ago, because I figured our local pools wouldn't be open this summer. And even if they were, why take the risk? They had a display up for a giant 12' x 22' above-ground for $600. Way bigger than I really wanted, but more is better, right? There was no stock on the floor, though. One of the supervisors said they were going to get more in sometime, but nobody knew when. He said when they came in earlier in April, they had sold out their shipment of six in the first hour. The next week, I was in doing our bi-weekly shopping, and there, like the Holy Grail, were two huge boxes sitting under the pool display. I couldn't believe my luck. I almost abandoned my cart to run to the register to pay for one. But I maintained my cool and finished my other shopping. After ringing up a cool $850 shopping trip, I began to think, ""My wife is going to kill me. My kids will think I'm a hero. But it won't matter, because I'll be dead."" Suffice it to say, I'm still here. The temps have barely risen above 80 this spring so far in the PNW, so not quite pool weather. But when the heat hits, we'll be ready. 

Now if I could just figure out how to fit a rope swing into that nearby maple..."
2020-06-03 14:24:27,"The Wednesday before Memorial Day our county parks closed all our in-land lakes.  I started searching for an inflatable pool (think a big kiddie pool) for my eight year old. Most places were sold out if they weren't sold out they were 3 times the price.  I snatched one up at a big box store on that Saturday. It 10 feet by 7 feet.  It leaks air and is a pain to clean but my eight year old loves it.  The inflatable pool, strawberry picking and the near by park playground (rarely used) will help us get through the summer."
2020-06-03 14:29:51,"The only thing better than having your own pool is knowing someone who does. So two years we built a heated above-ground pool and deck for our son and his family, as they live five minutes away. While not as fancy as an in-ground model, we chose a very large pool by above-ground standards -- 30' in diameter -- and it's working for us as our grandchildren are still young and learning to swim.  We had been starting to question the investment we made until now; this summer, however, will be the season of the poolside vacation."
2020-06-03 15:27:15,"My father put up an above ground round pool every year for us in pre air-conditioned S Texas. We absolutely loved it and I know it was a lot of work. He took it down every fall which is not done so much these days-so it was really a lot of work.
In my old age I have an in ground pool which I love. But the demand is hitting all around. It needs a part which has been back ordered and is in short supply. The part is essential and it can't be used by groups until it arrives as it is harder to keep it sanitized with a disabled pump.  Also I decided to start doing more of my own maintenance since I am at home. Pool vacuums of various sorts are also sold out. So think hard before you jump into a purchase. A pool with issues soon becomes a bacterial soup and eyesore. That said be prepared to share if you have a pool-this summer more than ever."
2020-06-03 15:27:23,"We put in a Doughboy “in-ground” pool five years ago, and I love it, especially now when I wouldn’t set foot in a public pool.  It’s 16x24 and has steps.  We surrounded it with stepping stones and pea gravel.  We are lucky to have a large yard divided by the garage and art studio so could easily fence it off, making it difficult for my young grandchildren to access.

Some things I learned:
1.  I wish we had heated it.  Even in hot Pasadena the water doesn’t warm up.  At this point it would be costly to add heater and would require more permits.  Don’t waste money on those insulated bubble tarps, they only heat an inch deep and encourage algae growth.
2.  You may have to obtain permits if putting in ground.  Not an easy task in Pasadena and required hiring an architect to draw plans.  An unplanned expense.
3.  As we have trees, algae easily forms.  Algae is difficult to control if inexperienced with pool maintenance.  We ended up hiring a pool man who does an excellent job and had us trim back the trees to help.  

Enjoy your new pool!  Even with the caveats listed, I would still put in a pool.  Learn from my mistakes!"

Have replaced the liner, the pump, the sand filter and have  had deck painted twice in that time span. Easily $3-5K in addition to all the chemicals and the pool service guys to open and close each year. Am I giving you an idea of the total expenses? However. It's nice to swim in on hot, humid days. Our neighbors tore theirs out and it cost $2K to dispose of all the wood from the decking. And the sand foundation never seems to drain properly. These things are like boats. Beware."

If you need something for parents, you can convert just about anything into an ice bath. Does it hold water? You have an ice bath. I've seen NFL players using stock containers a lot smaller than 10 feet.

We should also note a bathtub is essentially a stock container with plumbing. You can in fact buy inflatable bathtubs. If you extend this thinking, an inflatable raft really isn't any different from an inflatable bathtub either. You could gut a steel rowboat for all I care. Just make sure you remember the ice."

This is a serious public health issue; pools are dangerous backyard features. Please, NYT, follow up on this trend. Persuade your readers to follow local laws and push municipalities to enforce them by highlighting the problems and dangers.

2020-06-03 17:21:52,"I don’t see the article presenting any kind of a balanced view, that maybe the opportunity to spend more time with your child is a good thing, that that’s the good part of it. Childhood is precious. It is also fleeting. That’s the other side. The authors don’t acknowledge that. Maybe they don’t know it’s there."
2020-06-03 17:22:08,"This is why there should universal childcare in this country. Women for the most part do not have a right to work in this country unless they are able to afford after school care, day care or nannies. That to me is a form of discrimination. This in particular hurts single mothers who already have the additional burden of having to provide singlehandedly for their children.

In addition, many of my friends and colleagues agree that there is a complete cultural lack of preparation and training of men for childcare. It's not just that women's careers are considered less valuable, it is also that they have to choose between their careers or leaving kids with a partner who thinks that raising his own children is ""babysitting."" Until we as a society create higher expectations for men's roles in caring for their children this will persist. 

If things don't change the economic disparity between men and women in this country will only get worse. We will lose decades of progress, affecting generations of women and their families. As a working mom trying to keep it together during this time, this is heartbreaking."

You know, would the chance to improve opportunities for children - high-quality and affordable child care, paid maternity and paternity leave, health care for all - which also improve women's equality, be of consideration by our political machine?

Naw. This is the unequal United States of America. Work on and harder!"

2020-06-03 17:52:00,"The pandemic has created a situation where the care of the child, meaning schoolwork, emotional support, stress management, socialization, etc. all have to fall somewhere. These needs either go unmet or are met by a parent. Oftentimes, this parent is the mother. With a single parent it falls all one person. The choice (if it is even a choice) for the adult is about priorities, do we do our own work or do we put that aside to fulfill our child's need? Everyone's way of answering this question is individual, but I'd guess that for most the equation results in lower quantity or quality of their own work in order to help their children. The more their children need, the greater the sacrifice made. Of course there will be long term effects from this pandemic, for both parents and children."
2020-06-03 17:54:08,"Change needs to happen inside the home.  Why are many women still doing so much more of the childcare work? After pregnancy/birth/breast-feeding is complete, childcare duties absolutely should be 50%-50%."

In your opening example, you say ""Mr. Dressler was furloughed and took over some of the child-care responsibilities."" Well, then why are you only focusing on Mrs. Dressler and her anxieties? Similarly, your final example about the McMasters states that both have full-time jobs. Yet you make it seem as if Mrs. McMaster is the only one who has to worry about how to balance her job with childcare. in this way, you are perpetuating the very problem you are trying to highlight. If you framed how to balance work and childcare as a FAMILY problem, that requires both mothers and fathers (and their employers) to address, you might accomplish something other than feeding the stereotype you are supposedly trying to undo."
2020-06-03 18:00:49,"Those of us who have middle school aged children have worked through two economic crises. I have a 12 year old and quit working in 2008 due to the economic down-turn and the pregnancy of my second child. I've never recovered from the first crisis. 

This new crisis, a pandemic closing camps & very few childcare options for my kids who aren't truly independent enough to stay at home from 8-5 all summer and weren't independent enough to complete distance learning, is just another hit. I'm just praying I get to keep working from  home through the summer. 

Let's face it though, day-camps that run from 9-3 pm or 1-4 pm aren't enough to sustain working mothers anyway. It causes a huge amount of driving and stress to shuttle them to different arrangements throughout the work day.  Everything feels like it's hanging by a thread: career duties, housework, childcare."
2020-06-03 18:06:47,"Cue all the defensive ""This article makes men look bad"" and ""I'm a perfect husband who has always helped out around the house"" comments. It is a fact that most American husbands do much less housework and childcare than their wives, even when their wives work more hours than they do. Men just PERCEIVE themselves as doing more household duties. In fact, a major reason women divorce their husbands is they feel overwhelmed with responsibilities and get no support from them. 

Oftentimes women ask their husbands to help, men ignore their requests, and women get tired of asking so they give up and do it themselves. Or wives never expect their husbands to help them in the first place. Of course, not all husbands fail to take on their share of the responsibilities. But the issue is widespread. And now, more than ever, wives need a lot of support from many sources to gain and maintain employment."
2020-06-03 18:07:02,"This is a social problem - the government has no interest in providing quality childcare, either through subsidies or directly running centers. Employers have no interest in flexible schedules for parents (less than full-time hours, later or earlier working times, etc.). The only way to address these problems is through coordinated action in running candidates, supporting candidates, and pressuring officeholders, to actually care about families."
2020-06-03 18:08:43,"""As Mr. Dressler, a delivery driver, continued his routes near their home in Newbury, Ohio, Ms. Dressler spent her days caring for their 3-year-old twins.

Later, Mr. Dressler was furloughed and took over some of the child-care responsibilities.""

Say what?  He took over 'some' of the child-care responsibilities??  But left his wife to continue to do her full-time job and the remaining childcare?

Women need to stop saying stuff like this is a 'women' (plural) problem.  No, it's a woman problem, in this case, the particular woman in question.  If you didn't marry the right kind of guy, that's on You. 

Women, when they frame this is a gender-based problem, are trying to deflect their own responsibility in creating the problem, enabling the problem, or outright accepting that which they should not have, all because they were more focused on 'being' married."

By playing the identity card over and over again you divide not unite ie all people having it tough vs the rich who are not.

Hillary blew it with identity obsession She snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, with the worst run campaign in modern history ie running an identity/social engineering obsessed campaign with a Neo con twist, exactly what moderate voters in swing states that elect presidents in the electoral college did not want. 

She did not learn from the master teacher Obama who ran as an American and not an angry young black man and served two good terms uniting a majority of America.

2020-06-03 18:11:19,"I am no longer a young woman. Life has taken many turns. One thing that I have learned is that if adults wish to parent children, there are responsibilities and duties involved which must be met. Raising children requires guiding them into an independent life with skills, education,manners, values that will serve them well.This takes at least two adults and at least one of them spending a lot of time with the children, apart from any career. The gender of these adults is irrelevant. What IS relevant is that most families are not rich enough to provide child care, cleaning staff, a cook, someone to take care of civic involvement like taxes, DMV, and maybe a gardener. Yes, the adult ""neglecting"" career ""suffers"" temporary loss of income and/or pension, but done well, the children prosper and become independent enough for that adult to re-enter the work force. If a family shares the wealth over time, everyone benefits.
The single parent by choice is choosing a risky path that perhaps should be more seriously challenged upfront. Without a partner, all things become more difficult.
What amazes me is the rush of young women to ""have it all"" so early. We tend to live longer, and in many societies the ""crone"" has matriarchal status in old age that is, in some ways, a compensation for those childbearing years."
2020-06-03 18:14:54,"We cannot be naive to think that your employer is going to give you a fantastic maternity/paternity leave when our country has no collective policy towards maternity or paternity leave. So you need to think twice before deciding on having a child and what implications that will cause both professionally and in your marital life. If you're a project manager and you decide to get pregnant, your employer is not going to wait for you to settle down, especially if the employer feels that the projects that you're managing will be compromised, the project management role will be given to someone else who's time is not compromised. Until our country has a collective maternity and paternity leave policy that is embedded in reality, you are at the mercy of your employer.

If you and your spouse are working professionals with children, then it is incumbent on the both of you to delegate tasks and responsibilities towards your children. It's not rocket science in understanding the fact that having children and bringing a human being into this world requires sacrifice and time. So if you're a married person trying to wrap your head around why your bearing the brunt of the work as your significant other comes back from work hours later and does nothing at all, then that's a communication issue where roles and responsibilities have not been clearly discussed and acknowledged. You shouldn't bring a human into this world if both of you aren't ready to sacrifice your comfort."

Everyone would benefit, not just the ones with children. Preschool for all, regardless of ability to pay. Those are the people who will be working when we are collecting Social Security.

Honestly, it didn't look good to me. I was ok with never getting married and didn't want kids. I would up getting married but we agreed we didn't want kids and my husband is a feminist.

But as a mother living and working in Germany, it annoys me that this article makes European childcare policies sound like a panacea. I can assure you that things here are not that rosy for women, especially mothers, either. I absolutely agree that the US needs better parental leave and childcare policies. But in Germany, women still take the vast majority of unpaid leave and perform the most unpaid caregiving, both for children and parents. Germany's gender pay gap is higher than the EU average. At 74%, the labor force participation rate of women is higher than the US (67%), but that statistic is masking the fact that in Germany, 66% of mothers of children under 18 work part-time vs. only 5% of men. As a result, many women risk poverty in old age. The only woman ever to head a DAX-30 company - an American, no less - was forced out after six months. In France, also mentioned in the article, women's labor force participation is 68% vs. 67% in the US, which is hardly ""significantly higher"". Belgium's is lower than the US despite subsidized childcare and family leave policies. So yes, women and families in the US face a very unsupportive infrastructure. But European-style family policies don't make those problems of inequality disappear, either."
2020-06-03 18:52:07,"""In April, Ms. Kuwana quit her job, the best-paying work she’s ever had. She was spending more than eight hours a day hunched over her laptop at her kitchen table for work, and then another six hours for the volunteer effort [delivering meals for front-lien workers], which she did not want to abandon. The effort aggravated the tendinitis in her right elbow.""

This isn't a work family balance issue. If her paying work is so important to her, find someone else to manage the volunteer work. And yet, if her husband is a highly paid doctor, she doesn't really need to work, and so she made her choice, no matter how important she says it's important for her identity to work outside the home. She just prefers to be at home looking after her family and doing volunteer work."
2020-06-03 18:55:03,"This is exactly why, as a young woman, my partner and I decided that we would not have children. We both wanted a career and I was clear that I was NOT going to try to do both. We briefly considered having a child, with my partner staying home full time to parent. He was less emotionally invested in his career. But, ultimately we decided that we did not need to have children to be happy and that we were very satisfied with our life - childless. I have never regretted the decision.
This is not to say that I don't advocate generous support for parenting - I do.
My point is this: I wish young people would more thoroughly consider the option of not having children. I wish we would stop asking young couples ""when are you going to have children?"" and instead ask ""ARE you going to have children?"" and hope they really consider the option of remaining childless.
Children are the future and we need to support their well being as a community, whatever this looks like."

One dad did full-time child care during day and juggled his full-time work responsibilities early morning and late evening; another dad is the one working part-time thanks to the Covid-FMLA. My husband and I are fully 50-50 on childcare. Once I transition back to office (prob. fall), my husband will be the one to use the FMLA to transition to part-time to care for our toddler (he’ll be in daycare half-time, too). I’m curious: did the journalists actually look for stories like ours? Or did they just stick to stories that matched their preconceived notions? Considering how many women are now out-earning husbands, surely there’s greater coping varieties than what is captured here."

I think the biggest impediment to change is our culture which prizes this “workaholic” mentality.  Why should we value spending more hours working over anything else?  How much more talented and creative our workforce could be if we valued time for people to parent, to go skydiving, garden, hike, write, play music, converse with friends, etc., etc.?  Why is the singular characteristic - willingness or desire to work long hours at one job - the trait we value the most?"

Since child care responsibilities fall mostly to women, this sets up a disparate impact situation for sure.

Men would face far more competition in the workplace.

2020-06-03 19:33:45,"This is a fine academic discussion.  Indeed, for families with children in modern America, life must be one sacrifice after the other.  Choosing one income must mean pretty much living in penury and in huts with mud floors.  Two incomes and you are like a happy family on a sitcom, one income and you are a ""for only 69 cents a day, you can help a child in some godforsaken country"" territory.  So, I am sympathetic toward all parents who are facing difficulties.

But here is where I lose you.   Eventually, after we have discussed the problem in all its nuances and interpretations (including those from every deconstructionist perspective), it ends with: ""will everyone please pay me for my choices about wanting it all and making a hash of it?""

There is far more to being a father and a husband than working 80+ hour weeks.

He works in a male dominated, highly compensated field, and my field is female dominated and one of the lower paying disciplines. He finished his degree first and immediately got a job. I had to leave the network I had to follow him. I've spent the years since then looking for a full time job , to no avail. In the meantime I've been tutoring. Even before the pandemic I was earning a tiny fraction of what my husband makes, despite the fact that we have the same levels of experience and work equally diligently. Now my job search is completely up in the air, especially since academia is in utter chaos with regard to what this fall will look like on campus. We were planning on starting a family soon, but now we have to account for my stalled career and lost earnings. If I continue to work part time through pregnancy and my child's early years, I will severely damage my chances at ever landing my dream job as a professor. 

I'm not trying to present my anecdotal evidence as data, but sadly, our situation is a good illustration of the challenges women in my demographic are facing. Women's work is less valued and less well compensated than men's work. Women are more likely to make sacrifices to their career because their husband makes more than them in the majority of couples. Chilcare costs sometimes outweigh what a mother can earn. My generation has enormous incentives not to raise kids. Ask Japan how that works out."

And yet kids continue to be at very low-risk for getting the coronavirus.

2020-06-03 20:11:09,"This article describes a number of different realities which co-exist.
Women, as parents,single or in a relationship, are being challenged to cope, adapt and function,with their limited, available and accessible,internal and external,resources in  a new reality for which NO one is prepared.

For many, if not most, they continue to search for, or attempt to create,effective reactions, responses and solutions based upon their experiences in their past-passed, “known” reality,within the constraints of what worked, mindset-wise.
Repeated efforts of individual, or couple problem solving, results in ongoing, experienced, maze- like  “entrapment” with associated frustrations, feelings of helplessness, depression and ensuing exhaustion.Physical and psychological. 
Since WE- to be delineated and engaged- are all in THIS together, group efforts involving mutual help, by temporary or more permanent group-problem resolvers may be a useful paradigm.

She has allowed us to continue to prioritize work, keep everyone on a schedule, and keep everyone sane. Even with her help, after home schooling our kindergartener and spending quality time with everyone, I still end up working several hours a few nights a week. I hope that people who can, check out care.com for nannies, call your favorite day care provider, or look into the au pair program. Flexible childcare will protect your sanity and help you with your workload. It doesn't totally have to fall on mom and dad's shoulders 100% of the time.

But please keep in mind I choose to work this split schedule because I choose to take midday walks with my kids because I want to spend that time with them. We both pop into the kitchen regularly to help the au pair make lunch, tidy up, play with the kids, read to them, etc. And she is legally only able to work 45 hours a week. Even with quarantine she gets a ton of free time to do what she wants to do - including taking that yale wellness course, work out every day, and run.

And lastly, do you realize it will actually benefit our society in the first place to have all these women safely return back to work and produce!  Look at some of the most successful companies in this country and their maternity leave.  It is proven that they actually had benefits providing somewhat decent maternity leave vs. Negative impact.  It is unbelievable people who have no children still complain about maternity leave and subsidized childcare.  Who will take care of you when you are old?  Who will pay for your social security?

2020-06-03 16:55:41,"Welcome to what stay-at-home mothers have been saying for years.  The discrimination against women who take time out of the workforce is real, not only because of the lost wages and gaps in our resumes but because nearly the entire childcare burden falls on the women in straight couples.

This also applies to the societal expectation of women vs. men.  Imagine a man taking time off work to attend his child's Little League game.  He is applauded as a loving and caring father going above and beyond.  A woman taking time off work would be derided as not taking her work seriously and other coworkers would complain that she is cut extra slack.

Even women who do not have children suffer because if they are of child-bearing age they could be passed over for promotions ""just in case"".

A woman who wants a partner willing to share such chores equitably should marry another woman. There's no law that says she has to be lesbian."
2020-06-03 20:41:27,"Yet another NYT article about how women are victims and marginalized, as if they have no culpability as to what happens to them in their lives.

Let's take Karin Ann Smith.  She has two (!) graduate degrees (still paying off student loans at age 52 - not a good financial plan).  This has only earned her a government job that must be low paying, as despite two grad degrees she  has just $500 in savings (It was her decision to take out loans and which career path to follow).

She has a 13 year old son (that means she gave birth to him at age 39) so she put her career/education ahead of settling down and having a child in her more prime childbearing years. That was her decision.

No mention of a father and his financial or emotional support - where is he? Did she decide at age 38/39 to have a child completely on her own? If so, then that was her decision. 

Being that at age 52 she has to ""hide in the bathroom with the shower on,"" she must not be emotionally strong enough to handle the many hard things in life that are bound to come along. Could the son's health issues be related to growing up in a fatherless environment, with a mom who needs to hide in the bathroom?  A symbol of strength is probably what he needs.

Yes she is in a highly stressed situation, but it appears that she is there due to personal choices made along the way.  Her task now is to demonstrate strength and calm and create a financial plan to make her way out of the pandemic mess.  That's her next choice."

2020-06-03 21:10:55,"Back in the 90's in a class called The Sociology of the family, we learned about the how gender differences play out domestically. This class informed my choice not to have children, a choice I've not regretted 30 years on. 

The unequal division of labor in the home has been well researched but little has changed. 

Domestic labor research finds that when men do help around the house, they choose tasks that are outdoors and are considered masculine; car maintenance, lawn care, snow removal, home repair and improvement. Research shows that men prefer to avoid the daily repeatable tasks; cooking, dishes, laundry, cleaning floors, and bathing children. 
Men gain flexibility because the work they do around the house can wait or be put off, these tasks are not immediate or repeated daily.

Also, consider the difference in the mindset of providing a house vs. creating a home. 

Men are content with and respected for providing a house (providing).
Women are expected and usually want to create a home (enhancing). 

Creating a home is time consuming and comes with high standards of cleanliness, order, and organization. Think Martha Stewart, The Home Edit, and beautiful images of homes and family gatherings.  Do men take on the pressure to create this? 
Being satisfied with providing a house does not have these labor intesive expectations and men seem to be ok with this, could women learn to be too?"

Just give it up people. Admit that you can't all have it all. Buy a cheaper house, give up the second car, quit the luxuries and return sanity to your family. Do the math and see if it really makes financial sense to have two people working. Imagine your children free to play outside in the summer, having you to care for them when they get sick, building snowmen together on snow days!

I do pick ups. We can flex this if work meetings require us to. But it's up to each of us individually to bring up their needs ahead of time.

My husband forgot that he has a weekly early morning Wednesday video call. He was feeling rushed today getting ready for drop off and was obviously agitated. I felt the agitation was directed towards me and thought I should ""fix"" it by offering last minute to take her in.

But I didn't. Why? He didn't even ask me to. He was just upset and I let him be upset with himself that he didn't bring this schedule change up ahead of time. My work is just as important and it's not my responsibility to keep tabs on his work schedule.

That only serves to give credence to the counterargument that there's no discrimination, just women freely (and for mystifying, illogical-seeming reasons) making choices that harm their own economic and career-development interests.

1. Do you hear children in the background? Support that parents can have children at home and get things done. Think of the effective political candidate with their child under the podium. Or the funny video of the Dad on TV and the kid in the background.
2. Necessary travel ?(May not be applicable now). Have it at a hub airport hotel for a quick trip in and out for those who can’t stay. 
3. Hire the very qualified candidate who may have stepped out of their career for awhile. Any candidate can leave for any reason. This candidate will be refreshed and be grateful.
4. Put charitable donations into organizations that support women.

2020-06-04 00:29:26,"""This pandemic has exposed some weaknesses in American society that were always there,” said Ms. Stevenson, a former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department, “and one of them is the incomplete transition of women into truly equal roles in the labor market.”

I think the major weakness in American society is that wages for the average worker are insufficient. We unquestionably accept the notion that ""it takes two incomes to raise a family"". Workers clamber for paid parental leave, subsidized child care and other accommodations.    But the push for preferential policies for employees with children is not fair. There are many ways to contribute to society, raising children responsibility is one; there are many others. I would prefer corporate and public policies that more broadly support work/life balance to the benefit of all. We have a long way to go."

Those of you saying parents “cut back/cheapen your lifestyle”.  Prior homeowner, now I rent.  Car is 15 years old.  My kids get one extracurricular activity each. We take a road-trip vacation yearly (can’t afford flying or Disneyland) and thrift shopping saves us.  But even prior to covid, my professional absence and related “losses” are legitimate.  Some of my contacts are retired or passed away.  My skills feel blubbery! After 10 years, can someone really remember how effective I was at work?  Does it really count after this long? My post-kids career confidence is fading.  Same as my confidence in my “true” availability to an employer. 40-60 hour workweeks per parent are tough without a loyal, paid village.

The truth is, babies deserve to be cared for by their parents, so we need paid parental leave for both women and men.  Then, as parents return to work, we need professional child care, with teachers who are well trained and paid a worthy wage and benefits to care for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.  It is time for America to catch up with the rest of the world in supporting working families in 2020. Parents, both men and women, want and deserve to care for their children and have meaningful jobs, and early childhood educators should be respected and paid for their essential work."

We choose partners and build lives around the world in which we're living. Most of us made a deal: full time work with child care, 50/50 split of other responsibilities. All of that fell apart in early March: Would anyone have guessed that child care would disappear for months with only a few days notice? That one partner would become essential, or conversely, get laid off? A role of the dice determines which partner that is, or if it's both. A rapid-fire decision is then needed about how to balance children, who takes time off, how to share workload. Which is, of course, when ingrained gender roles come into play."

2020-06-04 03:23:30,"It’s ridiculous to think that trying to shame men into doing more housework is going to change gender norms around work and housework. The only path to change that I can see is for educated women to utilize their privilege to upend existing norms by simply refusing to marry someone who has higher earnings capacity (""marry up"") and refusing to have kids unless they can afford to support them on their OWN income. What will that accomplish?
1.	You won’t feel compelled to make career sacrifices to support a husband’s career, and your husband is more likely to support yours. 
2.	You won’t be tempted to marry for money, or end up turning a romantic relationship into an economic arrangement.
3.	You won’t feel trapped in a marriage that you may end up wanting to leave. 
4.	You’ll be more successful in the workplace because you’ll be on par with your male colleagues who all have spouses without demanding careers of their own who can pick up the slack at home.  Your career success will give you more influence over gender equality beyond the household. 
5.	You’ll set an example of progressive gender norms for your children.
6.	The new norms you promote will (eventually) relax the pressure on men to work ridiculous hours just to make money so that they can attract a wife and have a family. Men with a passion for care-giving or activism will eventually feel less concerned about choosing career paths in low-paid sectors since they will no longer be sacrificing their chance at a family."

I have a special needs daughter that I have watched her progress evaporate during distance learning. There are no services available this summer. The state of California does not care about children, their education, or working parents. Newsom only cares about affluent white older voters who sue school districts for changing their ocean views or taking too long to complete construction. There is currently a standoff with waiting for funds from the federal government before the school districts in SoCal can even commit to opening in the fall let alone the gap this summer. The Trump administration will not give California a dime.

I was also taken aback at the woman who quit her job in part because her college age child (?) came home from college and her 17 year old was doing online college tours and tests. Taking care of kids who are adults is that hard for her?

Men need to do their share around the house, and women need to dump those who don't.

Not to mention the emotional care taking of stressed, lonely, scared kids. All these women also have full time jobs equal to, more high paying, and/or more demanding than their spouse.

2020-06-04 14:44:47,"Every time we say “working mother,” we are reinforcing an idea of economy that fails to acknowledge the unpaid contributions of millions of people in our country that do essential caregiving work—for children, for elders, for family with special needs. Even to say that those givers are home is to fail to recognize the enormous and powerful work they do beyond their homes for extended family, neighbors, and as volunteers in their communities for no wage or benefit, no present or future security. I’m concerned about the gendered impact of the pandemic— from the stress of carrying burdens that are usually outsourced to a myriad of others to the disappearance of women from corners of activity that have been very hard won. I’m also hopeful that it may remind us why it’s important to get behind solutions like UBI and universal health care that support all people, including those we depend on for free or low wages to get “back to work.”"

Not only have predominantly female jobs been affected (retail, childcare, restaurants, travel), but my experience is that companies are targeting women when they need to cut jobs.  They assume many working females are part of a duel income household and can fall back on a spouse's income if we lose ours.  My outpatient practice let 3 procedural doctors go 1 month into the pandemic.  The similarities were striking - we were all females, we weren't offered furlough, PTO or leave without pay, and our spouses were all working professionals (doctors and lawyers).  The majority of our male doctor colleagues have nonworking spouses and it seemed too coincidental that no male physicians were let go at that time.  Although I am sensitive to gender disparity in my specialty especially as a proceduralist, my suspicions were raised only when the company reassured me during my termination notice that my benefits wouldn't be a concern since those were through my husband's employer.  The message was clear: working females provide superfluous income to their families and as such, are dispensible. When the economy necessitates, female professionals will be sacrificed to sustain a male counterpart's income, as the presumptive sole breadwinner for their families."

There is the mistaken assumption that  a positive result for an antibody-based or PCR-based test indicates active infection; that may be true. However, more often it suggests past exposure to an infection that has been resolved with the possible development of immunity of uncertain duration. Consequently, flawed decisions are made based on improperly evaluated test results. For example, PCR-based tests only detect only DNA or RNA that is stable and has been detected in centuries-old museum specimens. Thus, a positive test result could be due to DNA or RNA from ""viral debris"" that originated from a past infection that has been resolved; it does not prove active infection. This has resulted in uncertainty  as to whether asymptomatic individuals are really shedding virus that could infect others."

While its  difficult to initially control the infection rate, you should get better at it as controls are instituted.  Without knowing the initial infection rate, how does one evaluate the subsequent performance of controls in reducing the rate?

Fairly simple science."

The budgets for the NIH and FDA have been gutted in a similar manner. This can be directly attributed to the Republican Congress which was dominant during this period. The problem has been further exacerbated by the Trump approach, to make political appointments to head the various agencies that are compliant to his wishes, rather than to appointed the best qualified people. The Trump destruction of our health agencies, CDC, NIH, FDA, etc. has been similar in many ways to the damage he has done to the Justice and State Departments."

Finally, who at CDC can promise to be transparent in reporting on and describing the spread and lethality of COVID in the open vs closed states, and the impacts that arise from the sudden large gatherings from the protests.

Americans will never voluntarily submit to another shelter in place order if we cannot trust our institutions.  The politicization of information sharing must stop so that policy makers can make smart, nimble decisions to protect and serve.

Segment and shield versus total lockdown and the risks/benefits of each need to be discussed openly and immediately.  The bulk of the infected do not get hit hard - so there needs to be some nuance for proactively managing early on those not doing well.  At this time, I see NO measures being taken to facilitate early monitoring of every case from soft to hard hit - scientists are only looking at the worst cases heading to hospital.  How does this make sense to not study whether early actions can lighted impact?

This is too important to allow political considerations to affect recommendations and policy. Just like the Fed.

However, as flawed as the CDC is, when working properly can be of good use in something like a pandemic.

However much the CDC was ill-prepared to seek preventive measures to minimize the coronavirus spread, it was fear of provoking the ire of a bully with frequent temper tantrums whenever he felt challenged by his own public health experts. And then, out of nowhere, and with no sense of what he was doing, sidelined and undermined the CDC so he could impose his own stupid nonsense, all for self-protection and a reason to attack any and all daring to challenge his dangerous nonsense. Of course, his push to use an unproven, even dangerous drug (Hydroxychloroquine), topped his abuse of power indiscriminately, destroying any left- over trust in medical expertise.

2020-06-03 13:38:19,"The GOP has attempted to underfund, defund,  and pervert  the CDC since 1992.    We are living in a nation where ""faith"" end the Dow count for a more  than humanity and science."
2020-06-03 14:51:50,"The CDC is to blame  Not the Idiot in The White House.
Why was it that my husband and I (seniors) had to figure this out on our own after the first report from China in Jan.?  The story stated a young M.D. had seen an unusual virus affecting patients like previous Covid Sars.  He also fell ill and died!
I will never forget the conversation I had with my husband. We had both secretly ordered masks, gloves and supplies each thinking the other one would say we were crazy.
Unfortunately were were not. It was the CDC."
2020-06-03 15:06:58,"Excellent and damning appraisal of a failure. While some of this is due to Mr Trump's chaotic politicizing of the pandemic, the tunnel vision of experts has been a real problem. The Batesville Indiana situation described late in this article was repeated tens of thousands of times. A real blindness to what was happening and being learned in Europe, not to mention China, meant that doctors following CDC protocols were often doing more harm than good. And besides the garbled and mistaken messaging on masks, shared by the other bureaucracy, the WHO, there has been ongoing confusion regarding transmission via aerosol etc. Too much unfounded certainty.

But the politics sure doesn't help."
2020-06-03 13:42:16,"Redfield is a political Trump appointee. In a 1987 booklet on AIDS aimed at young people, Redfield and his co-author offered no advice on condoms or other preventive measures, preaching that the best way to avoid AIDS was to avoid sex until marriage. 

He went on to write the foreword to a 1990 book entitled “Christians in the Age of AIDS,” Redfield wrote: “It is time to reject the temptation of denial of the AIDS/HIV crisis; to reject false prophets who preach the quick-fix strategies of condoms and free needles; to reject those who preach prejudice; and to reject those who try to replace God as judge.”

Are 100,000 deaths (and counting) the work of God (as judge) or Donald Trump? Come November I think that must people will have concluded... Donald Trump and his band of criminal incompetents. As tens of thousands of courageous protesters have made it clear in the last few days - yes, it's time to... just say no."
2020-06-03 14:12:14,Trump is what went wrong. What did you expect?
2020-06-03 14:28:20,"Reminds me of the bush/chainee years of complete govt dysfunction.   The minute the Republicans get in to office, they simply go totally insane with power and control.   They try to set up all their bodies with well paying jobs with great benefits, but totally ignore the fact that a government needs to function and function properly.    FEMA, CDC, EPA, DHHS....ALL of them have rotted from the inside out.

It's the same and maybe even worse in Republican controlled states like Florida.  What a mess Florida is, along with every other red state.   In the aftermath of this administration the Republican Party SHALL cease to exist.  They've hoisted their body politic on their own sword.   Good riddance forever!"
2020-06-03 13:26:27,"In the past, I have written that the CDC failed all Americans regarding this virus just as it failed Americans regarding the ebola virus.   The Democrat partisans who populate these pages of course agreed that it failed us with this virus but they vehemently disagree that they failed with ebola.  Their motivation clearly is to attack Trump as responsible but vindicate Democrat Obama.

But the CDC did fail miserably regarding ebola.  When the Liberian pleasure traveler brought it to the US (because Obama refused to impose a travel ban), the lack of preparedness was exposed, procedures were not adequate, and proper protection equipment was not even specified let alone available so 2 nurses were infected.  The CDC and your Obama simply lucked out that ebola did not transmit as easily as this virus.  So, they had some time to scramble at great expense to get their act straight, find everyone the traveler had contact with and disinfect places where he had been, all the while enjoying the great good luck that no one else had been infected by him after the hospital sent him away the first time he went.

Back then both Obama's political lackey appointee as CDC head, Tom Frieden, both assured the nation that they were ready for ebola when it came.  They were not ready just as the Trump and his CDC were not ready for this virus."
2020-06-03 15:03:29,"Having people like Fauci is what went wrong. First the virus is not a threat and only three weeks later it is Ebola. Masks do no real good and three weeks later everyone must wear masks. Where ""public health experts"" are concerned there are none. Add to that political correctness and tiny tyrants like the governors of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania who forced senior facilities to take in coronavirus patients when they were totally unprepared you have a witches brew."
2020-06-03 15:11:26,"Are you kidding?  I'll wager that what is wrong with the CDC, the Center for Disease Control (suggesting that SCIENCE could be important), is the head is an evangelical Christian who doesn't much believe in SCIENCE.  When ""Jesus takes the wheel"" this is what happens.  Sad.  Trump has truly #BrokenAmericanInstitutions.  for whom we must ask?  For Bannon or for Putin.  Putin is the only one who seems to win in America.  Didn't Trump call him in the midst of our crises?"

- Government is bad
- Starve the beast
- Private industry can do it better.

Solution: Vote, November"
2020-06-03 15:13:50,"Simple answer:  Robert Redfield.  In one of the earlier press conferences, the adoring look Robert Redfield gave to Trump says it all.  Loyalty to a cult leader not the health and well-being of Americans.  

I will proudly vote Biden and blue in November.  I am hoping for a blue tsunami to clean our the filth we are witnessing and suffering from in Washington DC."

Please, Times, don't use agency press releases for agency descriptions.
Any reporter who has dealt with the CDC has known for years that it's hide-bound and self-protecting. Now, under Trump, it's useless."

2020-06-03 13:49:31,"OMG. The absolute cascade of failures makes me gnash my teeth with frustration and rage. Dr. Redfield will go down in history as the CDC’s scarlet-lettered buffoon. Trump? The malignant fool who broke the world’s formerly premier medical super-agency.
But it’s more than simply politics killing science as this excellent expose by the NYT makes clear. Why, in this country that birthed technology, is one of the top national agencies using technology decades old? The hatred and loathing of science by republicans? The reliance of capitalism to “solve our problems”? Top scientists fleeing to private firms? The model that installs top agency leaders according to politics not excellence?
I’m of the generation who knew America when it was the world leader in every endeavor and top-flight people flocked to work here and were welcomed. I am baffled and horrified as to how we have come to this moment of abject failure on every level. When so many of us feel we are living in a failed state. When our young are spreading Covid and revolution nightly in the streets.
The only ray of light I see is this high-schooler, Avi Schiffman(?) who should be installed pronto running the CDC’s tech division. Our only hope is to enlist these young people to rebuild our country while the rest of us get out of the way."
2020-06-03 13:34:39,"Sure, CDC is in big trouble like so many other science-based agencies.    But with your publishing the extensive biographies,Facebook, and Twitter accounts of your reporters, it makes clear the New York Times has become an ongoing talent show, a show and tell, for its staff, that eclipses the former newspaper function of reporting."
2020-06-03 13:47:36,Wait...I thought they were blaming the failures on Trump...isn't that the left narrative...if something goes wrong it has to be Trump's fault.  Mock Trump and hope something sticks.
2020-06-03 14:24:01,The Center was unprepared to Control the Disease of Trump. Covfefe-19.
2020-06-03 14:37:50,"Whenever I think about the CDC’s bungling mismanagement of the pandemic, I laugh and I think about all the Hollywood movies that have falsely portrayed the CDC as this flawless, quick responding high-tech government institutions with super intelligent and heroic scientists who are the ONLY ones who can save the world from a deadly virus. 

But the reality is that they’re a bunch of bungling fools using outdated technology, managing contaminated labs, unable to run a simple contact tracing system, and even unable to figure out that face masks are helpful. Who would have thought that the CDC’s infallibility like the rest of America’s myths was also a lie?

But maybe we should thank them because really what they’ve done has been to expose for the world and for some Americans the true state of this country—a failing country that elected an incompetent megalomaniac as their leader and whose core is rotting from its greed, incompetence, racism, misogyny, corruption, inequality, arrogance, ignorance of the world outside its borders, and its poorly educated population. 

The president described the governor of Minnesota as a laughingstock of the world in his phone call with governors a few days ago. Doesn’t he realize that the United States and the CDC’s response to this virus are the laughingstocks of this world? 

At least we don't have to endure any more insufferable Hollywood movies like Contagion. Who would play the hero?"
2020-06-03 14:00:15,"What went wrong?  It's a governmental bureaucratic agency filled with incompetent ""experts"" who have no accountability.  What is most amazing is that there was no ""go to"" pandemic model so instead we used the wildly inaccurate model written in Fortran, with a 2.2 million estimated US deaths and destroyed the economy for nothing.  For this mistake alone, Fauci should have been fired.

Why, oh why, do liberals believe government can do anything right is beyond common sense."
2020-06-03 15:12:43,"Although somehow it is still largely unnoticed, the CDC has made another mistake with the test for coronavirus.  They designed the ""positive control"" in a way that makes it unreliable.  The test is prone to give ""false negatives"":  that is, people who really do have the virus, are testing negative, and told that they don't have the virus.  False negatives are a disaster for re-opening. The evidence for this testing problem is posted on bioRxiv (<a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.094839v2.full.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.094839v2.full.pdf</a>) in a paper called ""Patient DNA cross-reactivity of the CDC SARS-CoV-2 extraction
control leads to an inherent potential for false negative results"".  This problem is easy to fix by swapping out the old positive control for a new positive control.  CDC now knows about this problem, but hasn't done anything, and it doesn't look as if they will.

Tests by companies that copied the CDC's positive control are also faulty."
2020-06-03 14:45:33,"Trumpo and his supporters hate intelligence, science, research, and the well-being of our citizenry. Full stop. They don't care about education and they don't care about the health of fellow humans. The CDC is just one byproduct of this."
2020-06-03 15:07:24,"We can all thank the republican party and their great saint ronald reagan for this.  Remember ""drowning the government in the bathtub"" mantra that they are so proud of?   This is a direct manifestation of that.  

I also don't think evangelical Christians are really Christian.  They spout off all the time about the sanctity of life, but while over 105,000 people die needlessly from this disease, they protect their dear dictator trump.  I don't believe in Jesus or religion, but if there is a Jesus, he is certainly ashamed of this.  To me, these people are nothing but money grubbing fakes - look no further than Franklin Graham and his ""Liberty"" university.

I do, however, believe strongly in the teachings of Christ and to love thy neighbor.  We all could use a little more of that right now."

2020-06-03 15:22:36,"I thought the problem was China withholding data  about the outbreak of Covid19 in Wuhan, not the CDC's  inability to interpret the data and take it seriously.  Now, we are close to 2 million in positive cases and  200, 000 dead.    Great reporting by the NYT to show that  America was not prepared for a pandemic that wouldn't go away by itself, especially by its president."
2020-06-03 13:47:21,"The CDC as a premier health agency is a self-proclamation.  On Fev 12 Nancy Messonier, Director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases issued the following statement: “CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.  This virus is not spreading in the community.”

Every first year college health professional student, every parent for that matter, knows the easy spread of viruses - think the common cold."
2020-06-03 14:14:08,"So, from reading this, it would appear that the scientists are not infallible after all, some skeptical thought when they speak is a good idea, that the circumstances of the pandemic made the outcome of efforts to control it nearly impossible anyway. I guess laying the full blame at the feet of President Trump is unfair. To readers like me, that find the NYT team overtly biased against him, regardless of what he may be right about, this reads like a carefully crafted retraction. It’s a start."
2020-06-03 14:17:20,"When you have one person doing the work of two or three or four or five, the work can't get done. When you have support staff, eg. admin staff (secretarial positions)let go and statisticians/researchers and other professionals doing their own editing and typing, the work becomes about editing and typing. When you have people working in ""open concept"" situations, where they can't hear themselves think, the reports lack insight and depth. When the focus switches to the typos and ""producing,"" relevance goes down the drain. It becomes about keeping one's job rather than figuring out what needs to be done and doing it."
2020-06-03 14:37:40,"Just one more, but deadly, example, of the malevolent imcompetence of this administration. All the failures of the CDC can be summed up in two names: Robert C. Redfield and Donald J. Trump."
2020-06-03 15:06:40,"A rule of thumb I use to assess whether someone can be trusted is to ask yourself.... “does this person have a realistic idea of themselves?” If the answer is no, then trust would likely be misplaced. The fact is, based on the evidence, almost all “sacred” American institutions - democracy, military, intelligence services, law and order, politicians, media and entertainment, healthcare, State department, foreign policy experts,  business schools, and now CDC... etc etc etc — did not have, and do not have, a realistic idea of their true level of competence. Nor should we be surprised when exceptionalism goes largely unexamined. In short, withhold your trust in any of these facets of American life or you will be disappointed."
2020-06-03 15:18:25,What went wrong was the election of Donald Trump and the appointment of the fawning Robert Redfield.It’s that simple.
2020-06-03 15:01:15,"If they started telling us to wear masks like in Asian countries in February, we didn't have 100,000 deaths.  Could've had less than 5,000 easily.  Blood is on their hands for the nonsense they told us ""healthy people shouldn't wear masks"" until early April while the virus was spreading like fire in March.  Colossal failure.  Wearing a mask, so simple to do."
2020-06-03 14:27:57,"If the government prepared to fight a pandemic the way it is prepared to fight its own citizens, we’d be out of the woods."
2020-06-03 14:32:56,"The CDC has had detailed pandemic plans for almost two decades.  That planning was first established in 2005 and revised in 2017, the result of extensive task force examination of the potential issues presented by epidemics.  It included extensive recommendations for establishing levels of community mitigation which balanced the medical, social, political, and economic consequences of government actions.

Anyone who is interested in the plan can read about it here.  Needless to say, it included none of the extreme lockdown measures we have suffered with over the last three months.

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6601a1.htm#F2_down"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6601a1.htm#F2_down</a>

When the coronavirus struck, those CDC plans were quickly discarded by political leadership in the United States.  Assaulted by a drumbeat of press coverage that treated this pandemic like the Black Plague, politicians from Donald Trump to most state governors understood they would be labeled murderers unless they took the extreme, and ultimately destructive, measures that have been imposed on our country.  So following rational planning was impossible, and hysterical overreaction was the result.

So it's galling to see the press, as here, blame the CDC when it was modern journalism that created this foundation for this catastrophe."
2020-06-03 14:35:31,"Pandemics are now clearly a bigger threat to our well-being than terrorism and wars. Therefore, the funding levels for the military and medical agencies should be swapped."
2020-06-03 15:04:13,"In the earliest days of the pandemic, from January to March, the CDC failure was largely of their own making.  After that, Trump's interference doomed the response.

The failure to produce a test early on was unforgivable.  The failure to trace airline travelers carrying the virus was also unforgivable.  Trump's stupidity was and is unforgivable.

Expecting a large political bureaucracy to rise to a challenge will probably disappoint us every time.  Political appointments of directors is a terrible idea and should be discontinued.  We should rely on large hospitals like Johns Hopkins in the future to advise us."
2020-06-03 15:11:38,"I am a doctor working in another country, with a couple of decades of experience in emergency and internal medicine. I have relied on guidelines published by CDC, AHA, ADA, FDA and other US public health agencies my entire career. 

This pandemic has single handedly demolished my faith in the competence of all US health agencies. I will be paying a lot more attention to what Chinese and other Asian public health authorities have to say in the future. China and South Korea are the only ones in the world who have managed to tackle a widespread outbreak competently."
2020-06-03 13:22:09,"What went wrong? 
The imposition against all reason of republican dogma on how everything is done since 1980."
2020-06-03 14:38:03,"The president’s daily intelligence briefings repeatedly warned of the virus.  That should of kicked off an interagency response if Trump had been paying attention and asked the right questions to the right people.  He did nothing and so his administration did nothing.  The White House’s frustration that the CDC does not take into account ‘political, social, and economic’ impacts clearly shows that Trump does not understand the role of the CDC, or his job for that matter.  Ultimately this is a failure of leadership at the White House."
2020-06-03 14:58:11,Do you really need to present a long analysis.  The Republicans with the un-president as chief cheerleader has gutted every federal agency that does not deal with security and military aggression.  And then we are supposed to wonder why they are dysfunctional?
2020-06-03 13:21:37,Premier health agency? I've seen nothing to indicate that it's premier.
2020-06-03 14:02:37,"Loss of confidence! What a joke. Fauci couldn’t get it right from get go! They were playing by the seat of their pants. Certainly they knew that low income, poverty areas would get hit the hardest. Viruses flourish in tight environments with lots of people in small spaces. That’s nothing new at all. Help in these hot spots should have been focused there! 
Everyone spouted inaccuracies as dogma. And the economy and the mental health of Americans went down hill. Certainly the riotous reactions have proved the point that isolation breeds anger and discontent. 
We need the CDC to be working hand in hand with some of the smartest minds in our country, not as a unquestioned entity. 
The new sanitation methods instituted in hospitals, businesses and public transit were long overdue to say the least. We’ve become a dirty population, a breeding ground for any new virus."
2020-06-03 14:02:59,"Trump's ignorance and disdain for science have taken us back 400 years, from Enlightenment to a new Dark Age. In 1633, Galileo was brought before the Inquisition and forced to recant his theory that the Earth revolved around the sun. Trump is forcing scientists, physicians, and public health professionals to recant their beliefs because they are politically inconvenient."
2020-06-03 14:12:59,"What happens when Americans elect a president who distrusts everyone except his family and his personal friends and, of course, his fellow dictators, Putin, Kim, Xi, MBS, et al.

What I did not see in the article was the withdrawal of 63 CDC scientists from China in 2017, the cutbacks not only in funding but staffing in an attempt to stop: ""The Deep State"" (translation: anyone who might disagree with ""The Donald"")

The decades long campaign to sow distrust of all functions of government lead to this - a nation that is not prepared because it is willfully ignorant. Add to that a congress that cares more about their campaign funds and amassing concentrated wealth and power than they do about their constituents and believe that it is OK to ignore all the people that did not vote for them. 

Trump is only a symptom of a much deeper problem in our nation. Perhaps it is time to start using postal mail to protest again - bag upon bag of mail just might get more attention than an overflowing e-mail inbox."
2020-06-03 15:03:55,"We have a medical system that is decentralized.  You were expecting CDC can coordinate them effectively?  There is no basis to expect that.  It’s like believing FEMA could have prevented Hurricane Katrina, and is the primary party responsible for the struggles in New Orleans.  It is based on a belief that the federal government is full of capable, dynamic professionals at the top of their field, who can fix our problems.  Sorry, no... the federal government is a jobs farm.  A bastion of privilege and complacency.  You should be looking to the private market for leadership.  NASA versus SpaceX."
2020-06-03 15:10:08,"The CDC had missteps. However, the main culprits were the Chinese Communist regime spreading misinformation and their enablers in the U.S. media."
2020-06-03 13:20:01,"The GOP is what happened.  They don't believe in funding anything that doesn't line their pockets.  They work to destroy anything that is seen as something done for society instead of Wall Street.  They are bathed in the blood of jebus, and fear no disease.  Then they brought Trump to the party, and crowned him king and the second coming of God. 
 As is well known, Trump assaults everything he touches for his own personal gain and glory.

That's what happened.  It's very clear to me."
2020-06-03 14:52:40,Trump was what went wrong. Guidance from the top to ignore the problem.
2020-06-03 13:21:12,"In one word? Complacency.

Complacency at the admin level, thinking we are the best country in the whole world and magically the CDC scientists will produce results out of thin air and no resources.

Complacency at the intelligence level.

Complacency at the national consciousness level.

Most decidedly complacency at the media level. For they too have drunk the kool aid about American awesomeness and exceptionalism.

That is what did us in. Complacency."
2020-06-03 14:21:45,"This is an example of the gradual collapse of federal institutions. The right doesn’t want to fund agencies sufficient to their mission, and the left doesn’t want to hold the workforce accountable for results. The many wonderful, talented people who remain in these critical institutions are left in despair, watching their life’s work and reputations damaged by poor leadership, poor funding, and political exploitation. I watched this happen during a 30-year career at a federal science agency. Makes me sick and sad to see."
2020-06-03 14:33:07,"I am a physician.  The CDC has been a massive disappointment; they were caught flat-footed, led by incompetence and taking orders from and capitulating to a deranged White House.  Physicians and scientists should know to rise above politics when push comes to shove.  The physicians of the CDC and for that fact the medical hierarchy betrayed their Hippocratic Oath and the populace.  A shameful display of incompetence.  What a tragedy."

If government is always considered the problem, if federal employees are continually disparaged and replaced with lackeys from industry and if we would rather give billionaires and corporations tax cuts than invest in centers like the CDC, this is what you get.
We have spent the last several decades convinced that the unique advantages of America's post World War II position in the world were somehow the consequence of our exceptionalism. I suppose it is that delusion that has allowed us, America's most spoiled generation to throw it all away."

The people who think that mask wearing is a political statement rather than a health and safety issue. The hospitals that should have stocked protective equipment. Parts of our government that should have done the same. Our lawmakers who did not prioritize domestic production and allowed free trade to run wild. And of course, last but not least, the Chinese government. The Communist Party that is only concerned with its own ""legitimacy"", which hid information for weeks, almost certainly under-counted its deaths by an order of magnitude, shut down the Shanghai lab that released the SARS-CoV-2 genome, destroyed everything at the Wuhan market, and basically ignored its own scientists' warnings about the ticking time bomb of coronaviruses in bats.

My branch discovered the cause of Legionnaires disease, the source of toxic shock syndrome (tampons), and the discovery that listeriosis was a food-borne disease. And that’s not to mention the careful delineation of the AIDS epidemic even before the discovery of HIV. All this was done through epidemiological investigations and excellent laboratory support. Dr Claire Broome, our branch chief, became CDC director, as did Dr Anne Schuchat, who took over my government-issue desk - both excellent scientists and civil servants and
much smarter than I! So it’s an unfair and inflammatory headline that CDC has ‘waited its entire existence for this moment”.
So what has happened? Subjugation of science to politics and bureaucracy, accompanied by multiple budget cuts and reorganizations. And now of course, the leadership at the apex of the Federal government has besmirched the proud agency I was once priviledged to be a part of.

It is also the premier defense against a biological weapon attack against our country. Until 2018, the CDC was run by the best epidemiological researchers & doctors. The  politically appointed administrators of the CDC kept out of the way of the doctors & did not inject politics. Viral pandemics are NOT political & we should not twist their knowledge for any president's political gain.

Until 2 years ago, when the CDC responded to crises, it issued ORDERS on how to contain and defeat the diseases. Under Trump, it only issues SUGGESTIONS with no enforcement ability. Doctors who don't toe the Trump line are fired or demoted. The loyalists censor what is said and done.

But, in the past 2 to 3 years , our  current president has emasculated the CDC (and most other permanent civil service organizations in government), weaponizing it into a political weapon for his own advancement & the suppression of any information that might affect his own political ambitions. He has been systematically closing subdivisions (like their pandemic management division), firing life-long professional civil servants & replacing them with hacks whose loyalty is to him and his re-election, not to the health of the American people. The scientists who remain have often been demoted for disagreeing with the latest party line. The political apparatchiks for a wall between the doctors left & the public"
2020-06-03 14:11:46,"For once the Times published a story outlining the multiple failures of a government institution that found it easier to be inward-looking rather than outward-facing-and-acting.  That was perfectionistic, hierarchical and academic, rather than fast-acting, iterative and communicative.

Not every failure of government is about Trump.

And yet the take-away among so many of the comments here is to lay it all at the feet of the Buffoon-in-Chief, and claim that money alone solves every problem.

I seriously question whether CDC will be ready for the Second Wave or even the Third Wave."
2020-06-03 14:16:21,"Remember where the buck stops.  The toxic White House and Senate set the tone for everything.  The damage that they have done in the past 3 years, and for some years before that on the part of the Senate, is staggering."
2020-06-03 15:08:16,"Someone has pointed out that their budget was cut to around 8 billion dollars.  OK, still, that is not exactly nothing.  I’m wondering what on earth they have been doing for the past 10 years since Swine Flu.    This article confirms what I had been assuming about the CDC for a couple of months.   The “don’t wear masks” morphing into “you need to wear a mask” was just classic.  Lying to the public is not a good look."
2020-06-03 13:21:19,"Covid-19 has exposed the rot and ineptitude of our once mighty country.

This is what happens when you spend decades gutting the government to help pay for corporate tax breaks. 

You get what you pay for, and America certainly did when it came to combating a highly contagious virus that our own President CHOSE to ignore for months. Optics became more important than results and thus science and reason were once again thrown out in favor of posturing and deflection of blame. 

I dearly hope we learn from this, but I suppose that will depend on who sits in the White House next year."
2020-06-03 13:32:25,"Don’t blame the CDC. Leaders at state and federal levels could have stopped the virus in its tracks but did nothing. 

Lots of people saw what was happening in China. Then Korea. Then Italy. And it was completely obvious that with air travel that it would hit the US. I’m no genius or epidemiologist but saw this coming based on common sense and sold all my stocks in Feb. 

We had months to prepare but our leaders did nothing. Cuomo is praised for his press conferences but the fact is that he is the only one who could shut down NYC yet he did nothing for weeks, instead bickering with DeBlasio. Trump was even worse. They didn’t need the CDC to lock down cities earlier before this all went exponential."
2020-06-03 13:45:58,"I am past thinking the events captured in this story and many others, e.g. the inability of our agencies to be functional at best, and as impartial. But I now think that all of these events are planned by trump and his bureaucratic worshipers. Call it conspiracy theory if you like, but to ignore what he is systematically doing to our nation is no longer accidental. It's part of a plan.

Republican senators have chosen to bury their heads in the sand. Same for Republican House members. They are abetting in the demise of the nation.

All of them should be ousted in November, or we will no longer have any claim to being ""the greatest"" nation."
2020-06-03 15:17:02,"Now Redfield is trying to rewrite history to help Trump's re-election. Trump soils everything and everyone he touches.

Trump Undermines R Democracy and Safety (every day, every minute).  

Vote Blue every opportunity

The CDC is no longer a trusted institution (nor should it be while under Redfield)."
2020-06-03 13:20:53,"This article is fascinating.  CDC and some of our other most praised federal agencies have suffered neglect to their infrastructure over years, developed defensive bureaucracies and are not what they are promoted to be.  Don't mistake this as a Trump problem.  He and the political members of his administration were as misled as we were.  A subtext of the Falcon 9 launch story over the weekend was that NASA is similarly outdated in its bureaucracy and decision-making, and that without SpaceX NASA never would have gotten off the ground.  One only hopes our military is not similarly afflicted."
2020-06-03 13:32:54,"The CDC did let us down.  Like so many other government agencies that have become bloated with administration and bureaucracy, no one is held accountable.  They have failed most audits annually going back to the start of this century.  Grants and other monies spent do not go to disease prevention, they go to social engineering projects.  And, like other agencies, they must spend their money to get more next year.  So, it's spent, it's wasted, and it's appalling.

For those naive enough to believe this has something to do with their budget being cut (it should have been), it didn't.  They are a disgrace, but then so is Congress and so are most agencies run by the fed (and many by the state).  Those in 'public service' may enter as hard working and altruistic, but that doesn't even last 12 months.  

By the way, all agencies are audited, and those results are given to Congress (ignored) and there is no law or regulation that action be taken on anyone's part!  This is a fact; our government is too big.  When I say that, I'm not saying get rid of police, teachers, etc., I'm saying get rid of administrators, hold agencies responsible for their stated mission, and fire those that do not do their jobs.  The VA and CDC are just the tip of this nightmare."
2020-06-03 13:37:37,"There is a massive solution to this - a high schooler being smarter than a skyscraper full of experts - it's called crowdsourcing, and technology enables us to capture it efficiently.

It is the only antidote to the tyranny of narrow-minded and backward-looking ""experts"" and the key to preventing, rather than simply recording incidents like the murder of George Floyd.

It is time to rethink government in the 21st Century, folks. Getting back to the old normal will destroy us. And yes, youth probably sees the future better than we adults do.

""Some staff members were mortified when a Seattle teenager managed to compile coronavirus data faster than the agency itself, creating a website that attracted millions of daily visitors. “If a high schooler can do it, someone at C.D.C. should be able to do it,” said one longtime employee."""
2020-06-03 13:53:10,"I think the amazing in-depth article boils down to this:

First, the C.D.C. was dealing with outdated technology and procedures. Second, data wasn't managed well, and people made mistakes.

Finally, Dr. Redfield was an ineffective leader who was no match for the political pressure applied by Donald Trump. I'm sure Dr. Redfield and the C.D.C. should have done a better job.

To make matters worse, Trump ran roughshod over the C.D.C., ignored damaging reports for political purposes, and played “cheerleader” to downplay the dangers of the Coronavirus pandemic until the virus was widespread.

Trump was completely unprepared and unfit to handle this national emergency. Trump is responsible for our failures, not the C.D.C."
2020-06-03 15:02:24,A new virus; an agency whose budget has been underfunded; a failure of politicians in DC to heed experts and respond with national guidance; a president who wanted to put his brand on face masks . . .  an invitation for Covid-19 to spread across the US.
2020-06-03 13:52:51,"But for Trump's overbearing presence and constant interference that hampered its functioning, the C.D.C's response to the Coronavirus was beyond reproach."
2020-06-03 14:00:11,"The CDC is now being lead by politicians, scientists who want fame more than to do actual research. How else can ordinary people make sense of the amazingly sloppy work presented to us? Dr. Fauci, a politician was busy saving his own self. Dr. Redfield, singularly useless at leading any enterprise and busy kowtowing. Famous laboratories botching the initial tests due to contamination. We have become a third world nation in every sense. With so many eminent virologists, one would think they could collaborate within governmental organizations and with US Universities, but all we get are jumbled, mumbled vague thoughts. I never thought I’d see the day when scientists cannot be truthful. I keep wondering, what do they really know about this virus?"
2020-06-03 14:43:45,"Our CDC served as the model for most every other country’s public health department. The training and knowledge of all those departments is built on work by our CDC. All the efforts other countries made to contain the virus were strategies our CDC invented or at at the very least understood deeply how to do. So why did the US have the worst response in the developed world? Leadership. Dr. Redfield’s appointment was opposed in 2018 due to his lack of qualifications to head a large department, and his history of letting religious beliefs dictate his work rather than the science. There is not enough qualified people of any one party to effectively staff our government. That is why Obama appointed Republicans to lead some agencies. Did we learn nothing from Katrina? Will we ignore the clear lesson of COVID 19? Qualified expertise should be apolitical."
2020-06-03 13:27:45,The C.D.C. received federal funding in 2019 to the tune of $7.3 billion and they still can't get it right.  Time to tear it all down and start again.
2020-06-03 13:28:29,"People want to point fingers but the reality is science is hard. 500 years from now, people will be dying of viruses and cancer, because we cannot stop evolution. We need to stay in the best health as possible and work on preventative health. 

Katz' vertical interdiction method explained early on in an oped in this paper suggested not to shutdown society but to push resources to protect the most vulnerable. It sounded like a good idea at the time, and it sounds even better now."
2020-06-03 13:45:21,"“The world’s premier health agency”.  statements such as this this are a significant part of the problem.  While in the 1950s and 60s this may have been true the remainder of the the world has worked diligently, has caught up and in the majority of fields of endeavorer has far eclipsed the US. If even possible, the first step in becoming premier is to recognize that you are at the back of the pack."
2020-06-03 13:56:41,"The CDC tried.  But, there were issues.  Myself and family were in the exodus from Europe in mid-March.  We filled out a form, had temperatures taken, advised to self-quarantine upon our arrival at JFK.  Then, after the “screening” we were turned loose to proceed to immigration, collect our baggage and proceed to our next flight, a flight full with 250 passengers, many who may have been exposed in Europe.

But, we did not become ill, and the CDC tried its best given the politicization of the crisis, the CDC and WHO by a less than stellar president."
2020-06-03 15:13:10,SO perhaps the C.D.C. is NOT 'the world's premier health agency'.  When a country continually brags about being 'The Greatest country in the world' & brags that it has 'the greatest military' etc etc the country can become brainwashed & complacent. The coronavirus crisis has exposed the shortcomings of certain countries healthcare systems including the USA's. When the virus was just beginning an Aussie study predicted up to 14 million cases worldwide of coronavirus--as time passes sadly that prediction may become reality.
2020-06-03 13:20:56,"The CDC should have been a beacon of light in the coronavirus pandemic -- as it had been in past health crises.  Instead, its funding was substantially cut by Trump, and as if that weren't bad enough, Trump put political hacks in charge for the sole purpose of watering down or even redacting the critical messaging to the public from the CDC's epidemiologists and virologists, for the sole purpose of ensuring that no information disseminated by the CDC would put the Trump administration in a bad light.

Masks?  Who needs masks?  Testing and tracing?  Nope.  Quack cures for Covid-19, like hydroxychloroquine or better yet, Clorox?  No need to immediately warn the public about those.  Report accurate infection and death counts on a timely basis?  Not our job.

But as galling as this is, the worst part isn't even that the CDC has refused to take responsibility for its own failures, but that Trump is getting away with taking zero responsibility for the sorry state of the CDC, which is part of his administration."
2020-06-03 13:40:31,"What went wrong is easily determined; There was no leadership at the CDC and no central command for an emergency. Finally there was no one at any level who knew and understood how to present the findings and give a forceful, indisputable report and action plan to the President. No one was prepared to stand up to a White House that was more concerned about image than the lives of the citizens of the United States.  
The organizational and leadership  of two formerly great institutions failed America and the world. An ego and image driven president and his sycophants totally undermined the CDC.  The hierarchy at the CDC failed miserably as it found itself afraid of its own shadow and the White House.
There was also a failure of funding for the CDC and lack of understanding at the White House and the Congress for the need of funding.
The questions still remain. Who is in charge at CDC? What is its mission and its responsibility? Who is in charge of health affairs at the White House and how will that person deal with image driven motivations of the White House? How will we be certain that in the future science and technology will be taken seriously and political issues be put aside when the health and safety of the American public and our national security is a great risk?  
Not to forget we must also find a better way of dealing with friends and adversaries alike when faced with the next pandemic crisis.  China and the United States must reach a mutual agreement for cooperation."
2020-06-03 13:43:38,"The fact is that the CDC lost its credibility a long time ago among true scientists and researchers . However, it has kept its credibility among the credible public by massive lies, and censoring employees, and surrounding itself by Big Pharma plants. (I'm sure the vast majority of CDC employees are honest and hardworking, but the corruption at the top, as well as at the FDA, negate their valuable work). As examples, Dr. Thompson, who exposed fraud in an autism study he conducted (with others) about 20 years ago is not allowed to testify in any legal proceedings. Vaccine inserts (which must be truthful to avoid lawsuits) state that vaccines, such as the flu shot, have not been tested on pregnant women. The CDC still recommends them. Likewise a DOD study found that a flu shot in the previous year increases the risk of COVID infection by 36% as well as increased rates of other respiratory tract infections, yet still recommends the flu shot. So, ask yourself why the CDC has never commissioned a study of health outcomes for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children. Note also that the CDC has dozens of patents on vaccines and gets huge contributions from Big Pharma and Bill Gates."
2020-06-03 14:46:19,"I used to revere the CDC. As an infectious diseases specialist, I considered them the go-to source for information. No more. Their credibility has been shredded and destroyed by Redfield and Trump. When Tom Frieden ran the agency, the CDC was a pillar of the infectious diseases community. And now it's a purveyor of misinformation and misdirection"
2020-06-03 13:34:38,"The US is not ""great"" and neither is the ""CDC."" We just think we are better than everyone else in the world.  Maybe this was true 20 years ago but not now.  I hate Trump but am not blaming all of the CDC's failures on him.  And we want government to run our healthcare?   We need to fix our bureaucracy first.  This is a prime example.   I do agree that Biden needs to rebuild this agency from the top on down.  We will be seeing more pandemics."

An infection that proves that SDOH (social determinants of health) plays a significant role in illness.  This virus has demonstrated the divide in America:  my patients with the economic means have been able to self isolate and stay healthy, my patients who were working in factories and essential low wage workers fell ill to this virus.  This is America's Chernobyl!   Other countries tried to warn us and there was time to prepare but because of poor leadership in the WH this is the outcome.  Lack of consistent and reliable information, testing, contact tracing, social services to quarantine/support patients is what led to this debacle.  Blood is on the hands of the current administration and anyone who did not speak out against their wrongs.  History will judge them all harshly."
2020-06-03 13:54:52,"This is the saddest article to read in a very upsetting time. I think the photo of Trump visiting the CDC in March, wearing a red MAGA campaign cap sums up at least half of the problem. Imagine Obama had wearing a ""Hope"" campaign cap three years after his election, during a public appearance where he needs to reassure and educate as many people in the country as possible.
The CDC sounds like they have some serious institutional problems to sort out, and maybe with good leadership they will be able to do that. 
But I keep coming back to that cap. ""Make America Great Again"". I think there is a deep state, and I think Washington is a swamp. It is the nature of Democracy and so on and so on. But, as every presidential candidate since Carter has run a campaign vowing to clean the mess up up. It's sorta like claiming you'll fix the issue of bad weather once you are president in my opinion.
Truman said ""The Buck Stops Here."". Even if Trump did everything right, he is ultimately the person who must be held accountable for the failure of the CDC to handle this crisis well. He appointed Redfield.  If this had happened in his first year, he would have a legitimate claim that he had not had enough time. By year three in a term though, a president should have his agenda well on the way to completion. Can Trump hoestly point to all of the things he and his team ordered and planned to prevent such a tragedy?"
2020-06-03 14:05:08,"The CDC. and the entire world, was caught off-guard by the corona virus. Time for reform. reorganization and improved funding."
2020-06-03 14:24:29,"As a former USPHS office I cringe  at what has become of the office of the surgeon general, the CDC and the FDA which have all been politicized and have let down the people of American, and of the world, with their shoddy, incoherent, ruinous approach to the biggest world health crisis in a century. The 100,000 deaths were not pre- ordained and so many other countries have shown the rest of the world better approaches and how to handle a crisis like this. It is so sad to say nothing from these agencies can be truly trusted these days, and as has happened in so many arenas the US is shrinking , as if a witch in a puddle of water, into nothingness in terms of our importance in the world."
2020-06-03 13:31:41,"This excellent article does not even touch on some of the most serious failings of CDC in the COVID-19 outbreak.   Take modeling of the virus spread. Instead of providing state-of-science projections of the outbreak, the CDC left the task to others (such as IHME in Seattle), many of which provided to be seriously flawed.  CDC should be able to provide the best viral spread forecasts to the nation, including information on how different control scenarios might play out.  It did not.
CDC never recommended random sampling for COVID, the only approach that would have allowed them to know what is really going on.   Even today they are not recommending it.

In some ways, CDC is similar to the National Weather Service, another large bureaucratic science organization, which declined from world leadership to a much lesser status.  Is this the inevitable path of government science agencies?"
2020-06-03 13:39:48,"Who exactly considers the CDC to be ""the world's premier health agency""? Certainly no one here in Europe sees it that way...

This really is American exceptionalism at its finest."
2020-06-03 13:51:40,"Please stop saying that the US has a 'premier' anything. 

We've been surpassed by other countries in every category - especially government-related services. The only thing we excel in is the number of billionaires we've been able to produce and the inflated GDP numbers they perpetuate.

In every single category, from policing to health to manufacturing - we say that our confidence has been 'shaken.' No, the system has been falling apart under our noses since the 70s - everyone was just too brainwashed to notice. 

Other countries did notice, however, and were sure to build up their systems to be more fair, equitable, and prosperous.

Until we honestly reconcile with ourselves that we need to change the way we look at government and the way this country operates - it will continue to spiral out of control. President Trump has only expedited the spiral; he did not start it."
2020-06-03 14:09:23,Senior executives are given far too much deference (and compensation). All of the meetings and conferences and Powerpoints and tours; but the leadership at the CDC actually did not know that they were ill-prepared for what is frankly a relatively benign pandemic. The nuts and bolts of the preparations and processes are really the domain of middle managers who are too narrowly focused and compliant to confront the shortcomings of a large organization.
2020-06-03 14:26:00,"This article points out many of the problems when the confident and optimistic leaders encounter problems where convincing people that they are correct, is actually of no value.  The virus is going to do what the virus does and optimistic statements by confident leaders really don't make any difference.  The lack of guidance from the CDC is based on they don't know.  Good scientists know what they don't know.  And yes it is frustrating for people who want to know to find out their experts don't know.  This article is a record of frustration.  What you think the CDC should know, is not really relevant.  Their job is to tell us what they do know and the article explains that's what they did.  The frustration is they don't know very much.  Life is like that, just because you are rich and confident doesn't change the facts."
2020-06-03 13:47:47,"Historical underfunding and mismanagement of the common good is a core tenet of Republican ideology and policy.

You cannot have endless tax cuts for the rich and corporations for forty years without undermining the competence of the government, which the Republican has been very successful at doing for four decades.

Having said that, there's clearly bureaucratic sclerosis that need immediate treatment at the CDC.

'Some staff members were mortified when a Seattle teenager managed to compile coronavirus data faster than the agency itself, creating a website that attracted millions of daily visitors. “If a high schooler can do it, someone at C.D.C. should be able to do it,” said one longtime employee.'

The CDC's two main failures appear to be a lack of modern information systems technology and expertise and and weak communications management.

Those CDC deficiencies can both be remediated with an investment in information systems and better management.

Both are only possible when we raise taxes and when we put elected leaders in charge who respect the role of government in a decent civilization.

November 3 2020 is a chance to Make The CDC Great Again.

Register and vote....for good government and raising taxes to pay for the cost of a decent civilization."
2020-06-03 14:04:15,"Everyone, including the congress, omb and the administration and the senior leadership of the cdc and its parent agency, own this societal failure.  Coupled with the underinvestment in state and local health agencies, you get the results we have.  Worst outbreak in the world, and devestation of lives andthe economy.  Time to have a true plan to revamp, rebuild, and restaff our premier public health agency,before we,forget about this disaster as we lurch on to the next one."
2020-06-03 14:57:57,"The texture of criticism that suffuses this reporting, i choose to take as a quasi-description of how the agency has performed.

In the back of my mind, while reading this reporting, is the understanding that it is the political forces that have inexorably reduced the funding, unwilling to acknowledge the recommendations of the various agencies, for realistic budgets.

If you haven't worked as a scientist in a bureaucracy, public or private, you have no idea of the what it is like to be told: *no, you can't have the money you need to get the job done right, just do the best you can."" 

To be in range of President Trump, means that it doesn't matter what the actual issues are.  What matters to Trump is being in charge; facts, predictions, assessments, technical expertise, all threaten him.

In short, I was disappointed by this reporting.  There is very little that is new, that has not been already reported in the Times.  Yes, we know an agency can be gutted by politicians who will it so.  The real story is the US citizens, and their political representatives, who vote against themselves by lowering their taxes in the short term, and increasing their risk in the long term.

Let us now see what lessons are learned. Especially, as I think we are just in the beginning of a time of flux, as our existing societal systems begin to break down."
2020-06-03 13:46:22,"The CDC routinely drills for various scenarios. Certainly, there have been enough Hollywood movies depicting pandemics that there was ample material for constructing those scenarios. It is indeed puzzling, therefore, how the CDC could be found so flat footed when COVID 19 emerged in China. Further, their initial stumbles when developing a response suggests a degree of incompetence wholly unexpected. As we dump WHO and become ever more reliant on the CDC, these incompetencies must be addressed."
2020-06-03 13:54:24,"The critical problem is that we have no leadership coming from the president.  The president is not capable and unwilling to take command of the pandemic in a reasonable, calculated, scientific way.  When economic and political gain out weighs the health of the citizens there will be clashes with the medical experts. This pandemic required a unified national  effort that was lacking from the White House.  It was the states fending for themselves and making protocols on their own. I never thought I would see a president telling people to break state laws,  ""LIBERATE"", or not adhering to CDC guidelines, not wearing a mask."
2020-06-03 15:04:40,"Leadership can affect a host of approaches of the rank and file during any type of crisis in any type of organization. It will never be accurate to indicate that the CDC was negligent in performing its duties without a full disclosing of the resistance that Trump and his surrogates presented. And that information may never be known, at least not fully. Kushner told Trump that the virus was not a real threat, and the son-in-law was believed.

If the Administration had acted correctly upon learning of Messonier’s warning in late February, it all could have been different."
2020-06-03 15:16:52,"A long story, but next to nothing about a significant problem - what does the CDC's internal assessment reveal about the failures in the lab test production? There was a significant quality control issue there.  What and who was responsible for that failure, specifically?  Untrained personnel?  Lack of knowledgeable oversight?  What was the turnover in staff in those responsible for lab test development?  What role did politics play, if any?  What role did budget cuts play, if any?  What role did internal opposition to the Trump administration play, if any?  No doubt a perfect storm, but this is a significant story not addressed by this article.  No reputable lab in the country would have made the mistake of sending out a faulty test that was discovered not internally, but immediately by end-users.  Investigate and tell this story."
2020-06-03 13:26:05,"Very difficult to stomach. The lack of nimbleness is what strikes me. I suspect that the agency is full of incredible people. But, communication skills and forceful leadership in time of crisis appears to be lacking. The testing fiasco and the tracing fiasco are both amazing. And, dealing with the administration in DC has not helped. I hope when the virus is controlled that we have the good sense to honestly analyze what went right and what went wrong and act on it. The good people within the agency deserve this as does the country. And, if more money is needed, appropriate it. Maybe it is too much to ask an agency of 11,000 with numerous missions to be nimble, but, there should be a way."
2020-06-03 13:34:58,"As the United States spends vast sums on the military in the face of tax cuts, organizations like the CDC are starved of funding.

When we talk of crumbling infrastructure, this is part of it.

Then there has been an administration that publicly undercuts its own agencies to gratify a President manifestly uninterested in public health.

November 3rd. might be a good date to start fixing all this."
2020-06-03 15:16:46,"In its defense, the CDC  had to deal with severe budget cuts, and decisions had to be made where money was to be spent.  Unfortunately one of those areas where the budget was cut, was eliminating the reporting center out of China.  Had that not happened, the alarm bell at the CDC would have gone off much sooner.
I am appalled that aseptic technique is lacking at the CDC.  This facility houses the most dangerous pathogens on earth.  Every single lab at the CDC no matter what level, nor what its designated responsiblity, should adhere to strict, monitored aseptic technique practices. I am surprised that monitoring was lacking.
Dr. Redfield might be outstanding in his field, but it would appear he is not a good administrator.  He is in over his head.  However, he has been hampered by a President who has tried to control the conversation to skew scientific information to suit his political needs.
This whole crisis has been a DIY, leaderless, chaotic mess, hamstrung by a President who has declared no responsibility in handling the health crisis( because he is clueless in how to deal with it), coupled with a Party opposed to scientific facts.
I taught medical microbiology at university, and it pains me to say that the CDC will never be viewed in the same way again, unfortunately. They did not measure up when they had one job to do, and that was be the Centers for Disease Control. They failed us."
2020-06-03 13:29:45,"Epidemiologist here.  The problems with the CDC predate the Trump administration. When I finished my PhD, I looked into CDC employment and was astonished to learn that the CDC  would pay me less as a doctoral-level epidemiologist than the state health department paid me with a master's degree.  I didn't seek CDC employment and I suspect that my experience isn't unique.  Without sustained investment in the best science, the best talent, and the best technology, the CDC response was doomed to fail."
2020-06-03 14:51:50,"The Trump Administration.  Though not the whole picture, the Trump Administration is an essential element of want went wrong.  

Not that mistakes and challenges would have been encountered in prior administrations or that years of underfunding from long-term public goods falling prey to short-term political interests would still translate into aging technology.  

However, the Trump Administration's unprecedented use of policy-based-evidence vs evidence-based-policy hampered the CDC's ability to respond in late 2019 when infections disease experts were raising the alarm about our vulnerability.  Dr. Trump and his political cronies exerted tremendous political influence while the epidemic, immune to Trumpian bluster, took full advantage of open door created by their inaction."
2020-06-03 14:53:47,"Assessing blame in this way is short-sighted and disingenuous. 
I am confident there are plenty of scientists at CDC who have raised the alarm for years if not decades to improve pandemic prevention and control programs.  
But if priorities, funding, and staff are reshuffled by politicians and political appointees, progress can only move in fits and starts. 
We must do a better job of protecting our science-based agencies from politics. 
While some may argue that politicians are needed to bring accountability to these agencies, I disagree. There are other ways of assess accountability that are less disruptive."
2020-06-03 15:00:49,"The infrastructure of the us government is a joke. A thorough investigation, hopefully congressional with a lot of press coverage, is needed to find what exactly the problems were and, more importantly, how to remedy. Follow up action, will obviously be needed.

Will it be done however?"
2020-06-03 15:15:46,"Put the responsibilities and tasks of the CDC in the hands of a private company, and the same mistakes won't happen in the future.  Fire everyone at the CDC, cut funding, dismantle it."
2020-06-03 13:45:25,"What a perfect storm. We have an agency that's been underfunded for years with antiquated systems, that is apparently mired in its own bureaucracy, led by someone who might be an experienced doctor but isn't an effective leader or communicator at a time when these skills are essential. When this is combined with a chaotic, lying, science-denying president, the results are catastrophic. It doesn't appear that anything will change in the foreseeable future, so the only hope is that the CDC will be properly funded and overhauled so that it's more effective in the future."
2020-06-03 14:15:00,"The CDC has been revealed to be nothing more than an act by ""The Great and Powerful Oz"".  My spouse and I both who work in the medical profession are sorely disappointed by an agency thought to exemplify the gold standard in healthcare.

Kind of like the current USA that is supposed to exemplify democracy for the world."
2020-06-03 15:17:00,"I  wonder what CDC guidance would be had the White House not edited or deleted parts of the original draft. When I see a few ""if feasibles"" I know the WH has changed the text somewhat, but when the WH omits whole chapters on items like churches it gets more dangerous. Many persons making decisions need unvarnished truth from the CDC, not a watered down version. Local decision-makers often find themselves in the uncomfortable position of making decisions based on inadequate data, forecasts and guidance. When this happens, the risk of deaths increases."
2020-06-03 13:57:18,"For many who’ve worked with CDC before COVID-19, the failures came as no surprise.  While Trump is the ultimate destroyer, the broken data systems, sclerotic bureaucracy riven with internal competition, and Division of Viral Diseases rejection of all technology not developed in Atlanta have been problems for decades.  These issues speak to a culture that lost its way, ground down by decades of severe underinvestment.  If we survive this greater collapse into tyranny, I hope we will someday clean house and invest in public health with the same vigor that we still prepare for Soviet tanks rolling across Eastern Europe."
2020-06-03 14:53:53,"Although I would dearly love to, I cannot entirely blame the current administration for the appalling boondogle that is our response to the novel coronavirus.  Decades of neglect and underfunding for public health structure have contributed to this large-scale disaster (state-of-the-art technology from the late 1990s?  Really??).  Both parties have shortchanged the CDC and other health initiatives, despite knowing that we've been living on borrowed time, only very luckily avoiding a pandemic for this long.  Every epidemiologist and public health expert I know (yes, I know a number of good ones; related to a few, as well) has been expecting this for a long time."
2020-06-03 14:42:45,"If the CDC had been allowed to lead, responding in real time when Nancy Messonnier first made her statement to the press and preparing for the worst just in case, the US might be a very different place right now. Thousands of lives would have been saved, and the economy would no doubt be much stronger. 

Instead, Messonnier was silenced, and the CDC was made irrelevant by the president and Dr. Redfield.  In the process, the CDC has lost all of its credibility.  

Now when the agency ""updates"" their recommendations -- e.g., about the virus on surfaces not posing a significant threat -- I no longer automatically trust what they say.  I assume that those changes are politically motivated and look for other sources of information.  

Sad that the agency that should be looking out for the nation's health is now viewed, at least in part, as just one more organization designed to protect the president and not the American people."
2020-06-03 15:13:37,"An excellent explanation of what went wrong! Now we need to know why. But first, I am one of the many who expect a resurgent wave and am sitting here in the dark getting the mushroom treatment. My excellent governor knows as much as I do. We know there is not enough testing and tracing. We know too many people are defying social distancing recommendations. We know this is coming back. And that's all folks. The President has declared war on American citizens, on the Constitution, on democracy, fully supported by the entire Republican establishment. We are left to face this disease alone and on our own. Libertarians must be so pleased. I know my representative is."
2020-06-03 15:29:29,"Such a long and sad account of the problems besetting the CDC. I came to admire it greatly while working on my MPH in Epidemiology in the early 1980's. It was THE source of public health research and data that academicians and state and county public health departments could rely and draw upon. At all major public health threats, we could count on the CDC updating us daily on TV, notably as an independent agency without the looming, threatening presence of the president.

When did the CDC start to decline?  I know the budget has been severely cut. And there was one CDC director who resigned after pleading guilty to sex charges and one who resigned because of ties to the tobacco industry. The Center for Science in the Public Interest wrote the Trump administration concerning credible accusations of Dr. Redfield's scientific misconduct in pushing questionable HIV vaccines; they argued against Redfield's appointment. I know Dr. Schuchat, who shown like a star in her TV communications to the public, has been silenced for her statements on the severity of the covid pandemic.

But the CDC is not the only institution failing us. Since Reagan we have seen government as the problem and not the solution and our government agencies have been underfunded and overtaken by corporate interests. We have seen the weakening of Congress in favor of the ""unitary executive,"" and the politicization of the courts. And now, with Trump, we are witnessing even the decline of American leadership."
2020-06-03 15:40:07,"A rather gentle account of what is a tragic failure by CDC at a time is was expected to shine.  Meanwhile, Dr. Fauci has become the most prominent source of information for the nation, yet he and his agency are separate from CDC and sometimes providing conflicting information.  Fauci has mostly pleased Trump with his public statements, a feat in itself, but I am left with thinking that he tells us what he knows will be comfortable for Trump and perhaps if CDC wasn't muzzled, they'd tell us something else."
2020-06-03 14:26:45,"After graduating from college in 1974, I worked for 6 weeks as the Social Security building in Jamaica, Queens. The systems, both human resource and IT related were from the 1950’s. They still used punch cards, and we were told during orientation to always have at least a month of personal cash on hand because often the payroll system could not produce paychecks on time, and we would have to wait until the next monthly payroll run. For these and many other reasons, I quit. Many of the people who stayed were, quite honestly, already obese burnouts at age 30, with no motivation other than how quickly they could get to the vending machines with the Twinkies. This was the operational Deep State then, and very unfortunately nothing seems to have changed, at least not at the CDC. That a high school student was able to create a high risk travel database when they CDC could not tells me it is all about bureaucratic inertia over decades, not about Trump or even Redfield."

2020-06-03 15:45:42,"The private sector can handle this facet of the health system more efficiently – Contract the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 

The CDC is a high-paid government bureaucracy.  Career CDC employees are paid at a significantly higher rate than their peers in the private sector AND have generous pension and medical plans.  Like congress, CDC officers travel to exotic destinations for unnecessary conferences.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would deliver 2x-3x for the dollar, and be less politicized."
2020-06-03 13:53:24,"The CDC,I thought, was there to be experts, use the scientific method to advise and provide guidance, and to collaborate with other health scientists. What exactly is their mission? Is there not a mission statement for the agency? Did I miss something? Why can’t they function independently, provide guidance, and the politicians can take it or leave it at their peril and the country’s peril? Can it not be that simple?"
2020-06-03 14:04:49,"Supporting global public health should be one of our federal government’s priorities, even to those who believe in lean government. The deeper failure exposed in this pandemic is our lack of effectively applying the learnings of social science. How can we better manage the challenges of the political process, bureaucracy and even human nature? China, the WHO, the CDC, and our own government did some things right and some things very wrong. Among the silver linings that hopefully come out of all this is a growth in the number of Americans who believe that an effective federal government is critical not just to democracy but to humanity."
2020-06-03 15:53:43,"With NHS, U.K. handled the pandemic much more effectively.  It appeared and felt that NHS, and the entire network of health professionals, institutions and service providers, were in sync with the govt. The govt didn't appear to make the pandemic an political issue. The NHS did seem to have independence and were on top of things, and didn't appear to be under the pressure of govt, to make the status look good.
In USA, it is time to have universal healthcare, and a truly independent CDC. It is evident that, the political attempts to kill ACA, during these recent years, added to the dilution of the role of institutions like CDC. 
The importance for Universal Healthcare, should be as critical as the priority USA gives to the military. If the pandemic itself is to be considered, the cost of managing it, and the damage and devastation it has caused to USA, short-term and into the future, it is easy to understand, that having an universal healthcare system, would be far far cheaper, in the long run. This is not considering the lives lost. Looking at universal healthcare from a corporate point of view, has proven disastrous.
So, it is time ACA is strengthen immediately, and USA starts to work on transforming ACA into an universal healthcare system."
2020-06-03 16:12:45,"As an ex-molecular biologist I am shocked at not only the lack of information regarding ways to limit transmission, but the amount of erroneous and conflicting information as well. This information was already established 100 years ago during the Spanish flu. 

Here's what I thought should have been done two months before it hit the US: Factories needed to be repurposed and should have been making enough N-95 masks so they were coming out of the woodwork. Bandanas are not masks and are not effective. Same with tests, everyone should have been tested and retested to locate outbreaks and establish isolation. What happened?

We had a two month head start and absolutely nothing was done. Make America Great Again? That would be a huge undertaking. Good luck."
2020-06-03 16:38:01,"I worked at CDC for many years in the 90's and 2000's in the infectious disease branch. Everything that has come to pass this year was discussed and prepared for at length - even all the legal issues concerning quarantines and shutdowns. When I think back at the years of efforts we made to have the best physicians, researchers, technologists, equipment and testing available; research into many, many viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc; traveling the world to every outbreak to get a head start on anything that might cause world wide problems, it just mystifies me as to how CDC botched it all up at the most critical time in its history. I was there for the anthrax bioterrorism attack, and we jumped on that within literal hours and worked 24/7 for many weeks to cover that episode. We did similar work on many virus outbreaks the public hardly heard about but affected many people and countries around the world. 

I do think the fact the Trump administration gutted the pandemic response teams and labs two year before this outbreak was a key factor. And the fact that key appointees have no background in outbreak response hampered the need to be aware and quick about responding. 

The lesson is to not let our guard down and to fund the basic functions that are necessary for this kind of crisis."
2020-06-03 16:40:07,"Sounds like another version of the same old thing.  The non-science 'suits' squelching the opinions of the real scientists and doctors whenever it might affect ""the bottom line.'  The irony is that sometimes the 'suits' are ex-scientists, but that's nothing new either.  

An unknown in this situation, and the greater danger in the long run in my opinion, is the continued decline in availability of scientific, medical, technologically, and professionally competent workers at all levels.  How do I know this?  17 years of teaching at the University level.  Today, if I was to give a list of simple numbers to copy from one side of the page to another, many of the students in my class would have errors.  Many more than years ago.  The decline in K-12 education is real, and beginning to spread its tendrils everywhere."
2020-06-03 16:46:47,"Excellent reporting. Specifics aside, it’s clear that Congress, the Executive Branch and the CDC itself have long been derelict in keeping the agency on the cutting edge of technology. The concept of preparing in advance seems alien to all these parties, with cost-cutting taking precedence for Congress and the Executive, who seem to think tax breaks for billionaires and corporations are more important than supporting the health and well-being of the American people.  The latter, of course, don’t make big campaign contributions."
2020-06-03 16:47:05,"The CDC was not ready for Trump and neither was anyone else.The problems you highlighted could have been overcome with a Pandemic Response Office and plan and competent leadership. For one, having 1/2 billion N95 masks ready after the simulation over last summer (even Navarro urged this in January) and universal mask--starting with all the people coming from China and Europe --would have minimized the initial exposure. Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan used face masks from the beginning and have populations of 37 million to our 325 million and 34 covid deaths to our 100,000 and counting covid 19 deaths. Just making enough masks  and requiring use early on would have saved us from this debacle."
2020-06-03 16:59:14,"In constant dollars, the CDC budget has increased from $16 billion in 2000 to $40 billion today.   It seems like they should be able to accomplish something, other than writing memos to each other."
2020-06-03 17:00:48,"""But the effort was frustrated as the C.D.C.’s decades-old notification system delivered information collected at the airports that was riddled with duplicative records, bad phone numbers and incomplete addresses.""

All of these flaws would have been detected in a regimen of routine drilling and preparation.  In many of its services the CDC, just like a fire department, is a vital ""just in case"" service; in place to deal with low-frequency high-consequence events.  If you are in this kind of a service organization, you must train, you must drill, you must stress-test your systems.  And you must be doing this constantly because, when you are needed, there is no time for meetings and discussion.  You must act and act decisively.  

This kind of readiness would, in fact, be part of a Great America.  But Trump disdained paying people for ""sitting around"" saying ""we can get them if we need them.""  But you cannot contract out emergency preparedness.  It is a full-time job that must be done by knowledgeable and properly equipped professionals.

The leadership must go.  The leaders' boss should go too, but that will have to wait until November."
2020-06-03 17:14:49,"As this article notes, part of the problem relates to information technology and the exchange of information between agencies.

Antiquated IT systems are a major problem throughout the Federal government, which is very difficult to address. Part of the problem is the byzantine procedures required of government officials who wish to update technology.

The exchange of personally identifiable information between national and state agencies is fraught and political, often insurmountably so. One example is New York’s “green light” law which prohibits the state from exchanging driver’s license information with the Federal government. The state law was passed to protect illegal (undocumented) immigrants, but the information exchange represents a legitimate response to the 9/11 attacks. There’s a trade-off.

Another major privacy concern makes it difficult to share health information, even for worthwhile reasons. In the US it is effectively illegal for the government to implement a national patient identification number, analogous to the social security number. This is termed “interoperability.” It is a results of a 1998 law introduced by Ron Paul (Rand’s father)  and still very much on the books.  Most believe this law does far more harm than good, and should be repealed. Though privacy concerns are entirely legitimate, implementation of a national patient identification number would have great public (and private) health benefits, and should be strongly considered."
2020-06-03 17:23:54,"As a German speaker, I have closely followed that country's response to the pandemic. I'm just flabbergasted by the differences to the American response: although Germany is plagued by a federalist structure and bureaucratic hurdles not unlike those described in the article, they managed to roll out mass-scale testing and a concerted public response much more quickly and effectively than this country. The difference may amount to tens of thousands of lives lost and untold economic costs. I cannot help but think that the deplorable failure of the CDC is a harbinger of American decline."

2020-06-03 16:40:46,"TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP,   He is the one who cut the CDC, who refused to repurpose factories to make masks and ventilators, who refused to do early mass testing and tracing.  He is the germ we must stamp out.  A very tragic situation that could have been far less damaging."
2020-06-03 17:00:27,"I don't buy the  ""CDC failed us"" narrative.  Great career scientists, far too few,  with a leader not meant for this moment, embedded in an unsupportive, anti-science administration and an over-strained healthcare system, dealing with a virus that is intrinsically difficult to understand.  Think about this when you vote."
2020-06-03 17:29:15,"Leadership at the very top. Trump.

A pathological political ideology that seeks to deconstruct our administrative state. Bannon, the Heritage Foundation, the Koch Boys.

Small State Republicans who believe a weak federal government serve best.  A political ideology designed to fail in a crisis.

What went wrong. The Republican Party went wrong. Every powerful billionaires went wrong buying  our political system.

One sides propaganda media like FOX NOISE went wrong. Remember this was a hoax until it wasn't at FOX.
Some Christians who traded a competent well run government and a respect for science for access to the political system.

What went wrong began withe the western small state Conservatism of Reagan in culminated in the Small dysfunctional and incompetent proto Christian state of the Trump GOP.  


We are the laughing stock of the developed world and we deserve it."
2020-06-03 16:39:18,"So, the key issues appear to be:  data collection/management, executive management, and political interference.  The solution is to appoint a seasoned executive and provide funding.  Hello Eric Schmidt."
2020-06-03 17:32:05,"Look no further than the Trump administration for the answer to what went wrong.  Trump and his cronies have no respect for science and no commitment to enabling any agency of the federal government to function in an effective manner.

A Democratic administration would move to right those wrongs.
A Democratic administration together with a Democratic Congress would move fast to rectify the current deplorable situation, whereby individual states and governors have been left largely to fend for themselves in the face of a crisis of historic proportions.

The mindset of the Trump administration and its enablers, such as Moscow Mitch, are what went wrong.  It's time to turn the page on this rotted-out chapter of our history."
2020-06-03 15:48:43,"Dr. Redfield wrote in 1990 introduction to the book ""Christians in the Age of AIDS"". The book described AIDS as ""God's judgment"" against homosexuals.

The above is irrelevant, when management and scientific skills are considered. But opposition to needle exchanges programs and condom use should  discredit anyone from any important scientific/medical management job. And that book contained that exact opposition.

Dr. Redfield, since then, changed his positions on condoms and needles. But that 1990 episode shows he is not capable to steadfastly reject non-scientific pressures, to defend science driven work. 

The primary job of a top manager in a science organization is to shield that organization from random irrational pressures."
2020-06-03 16:20:17,I wonder what the CDC could have done with an extra $450 million that was given to the WHO.
2020-06-03 16:43:10,"When I was at Emory years ago, directly across from CDC, we thought of the physicians and scientists there as something akin to gods. It is beyond sad to see this institution whither. Obviously there are multiple reasons, but recently the Trump administration war on science and expertise has not helped.

And fundamentally it is the President’s failure to do what he was repeatedly told had to be done in February and March which is largely responsible for our current tragedy. Had he behaved merely competently the toll of disease and death in our nation would have been likely 75% lower. This is demonstrated by the results in other advanced nations blessed with actual leaders. Instead our President has treated us to a parade of magical thinking, ignorance, arrogance and deceit, focusing of course entirely upon himself and his re-election. This is the worst Presidential failure in many decades, exceeding the decision to invade Iraq.
It represents negligent homicide on a huge scale."
2020-06-03 17:26:41,"Yes the CDC failed us terribly, but so did the NIH and it’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). No one anywhere in government has ever taken a STEM course so they are non compos mentis. No one watches CDC/NIH, where the leaders are politicians. Scary. 
Leadership in providing proper guidance relating to emerging infectious diseases failed at all levels. While the Trumpian budget cuts verged on wrongful given well recognized science, I have to ask why, with all the warnings over the last 20 years, Fauci at NIAID and all who led the CDC via its revolving political door, couldn’t see what was coming. 
No one can predict the future but the science has clearly identified emergent zoonotic spillover diseases, and we have seen them: SARS, MERS, Zika, Dengue among many others. NIAID/Fauci had a team that published an animal model SARS vaccine in 2005. What happened? 
All these entities appear to be led by people who are either or both politically appointed or so self-interested as to avoid battling for progress and resources with potential loss of those cushy jobs. This phenomenon describes leadership in America now: get the job, then work to keep it, not to do it. 
You can’t blame the right or the left equally for this; SARS jumped up 20 years ago, HIV and Ebola probably as much as 100 years ago; thank goodness they are slow to transmit. GW Bush published a flu pandemic strategy in 2006. 
How can we take all this out of the political arena?"
2020-06-03 16:29:30,"Yes, the CDC should coordinate better with the White House on decisions with obvious political and economic overtones.  But you can't clap with one hand.  A president who thinks that science is a cover story for the ""deep state"" is not one who will be listening to any rational advice anyway.

The next president needs to do some wide-ranging reforms of the government health organizations.  Lets hope he is capable of it."
2020-06-03 17:27:14,"When you let the Republican party implement irresponsible tax cuts for the rich over 4 decades you wind up with a broken government.

This is what we're facing today."
2020-06-03 17:36:32,"The CDC is well-funded ($11B), did NOT get its budget reduced and is loaded with PhDs and other very smart people. It’s mission statement is exactly aligned to protecting America from foreign pandemics.  

So with all the emphasis on “listen to science,” the lack of preparedness has to do with how people and governments make decisions.  I recall on 9/11, the actual day, a news caster stating how America’s civil defense system let us down.  The lack of cross-agency info-sharing and imagination for how terrorists might think and plan left us painfully vulnerable.  

Just like with 9/11, apparently, there was no playbook for what “might” (or inevitably) happen.  We are a reactive nation, not so different from other nations who took Covid on the chin.  No one, CDC, Democrats, governors, health care leaders acted with urgency.  In fact, quite the opposite.  Yet, this paper along with its aligned media had one response: Trump! Trump! Trump!  Not defending Trump here, but it’s important to get more “real” than political."
2020-06-03 15:31:05,"Tragic.  I guess Mr Trump was being ironic when he proclaimed in his inaugural address that ""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.""  Replacing the old American carnage we have new and greater American carnage; a trumpian carnage."
2020-06-03 15:42:42,"Also, just as Trump took control, and coincidentally I started teaching Immunology and Microbiology to undergrads, he gagged the CDC from using the phrases ""evidence based""  and ""science based"", among others, in preparing their budget. ""Fetus"" was another one; so I guess diseases and never affect fetuses, according to evidence or science. Not in Trump's America or CDC. 
Such policies directly demoralise, and drive away the best talent from considering serving there. As intended. 
Those who lasted, and continue to serve: please keep reading Arrowsmiths prayer for scientists. Sinclair Lewis has you!"
2020-06-03 15:51:02,"""A suggestion in the guidance that houses of worship “consider suspending” the use of choirs and congregant singing because it “may contribute to transmission” was removed. Two federal officials said it had not been cleared by the White House.""

It is pretty clear that singing and masks are not compatible and that singing will be spreading aerosols more than breathing. That such a suggestion is removed for political purposes says all we need to know about the White Houses' view of science. And it also leaves the general public with poor guidance, which they would rightfully expect to be clear of political bias. 

It is failures like these that will make it much more difficult to effectively control the spread of the virus. Getting back to a close approximation of normal requires good information, clearly presented, not hope and bluster which will result in reliving outbreaks we could avoid."
2020-06-03 16:03:42,"If as you say, the technology was old, the data poor, the bureaucracy slow, the guidance confusing, the administration not in agreement, then by definition the CDC is far from being the world’s premier health agency.  Rather it’s another kaput bureaucracy in a failed state. 

As the journalist T.R.Reid described twelve years ago in his brilliant worldwide comparison of healthcare systems on Frontline called “Sick Around the World”, the premier healthcare systems can be found in countries like Taiwan and Switzerland, not the US."

2020-06-03 15:50:22,"The Democrats need to take the White House and the Senate.  At which point, they need to move the CDC from Georgia to Massachusetts.  

It's time that we as a nation take our medicine seriously, as well as our pocketbook.

2020-06-03 15:45:27,This is what I’ve been saying from the beginning. Whatever happened here is certainly not Trump’s fault but the fault of massive bureaucracies.
2020-06-03 16:15:47,"Wow! This was a painful read. 

Here's a wacky idea to give our CDC a state of the art data management system: Draft Facebook's entire engineering staff, put them on the Civil Service payroll for 1-2 years to rip everything out and build a world-class data infrastructure for our CDC. 

Sure it would mean the collapse and ruin of FB, but I don't care. I've never used it, and what have they done for me lately?

And, a generation of engineers who have been doing zero good at FB, and a lot of damage to our country, will have redeemed themselves. Told you it was wacky."
2020-06-03 16:44:52,"The silver lining of this terrible tragedy is that many of us can no longer be delusional about the state of our democracy. Nearly every agency you look at, dedicated experts are silenced by craven, know-nothing loudmouths."
2020-06-03 15:31:49,"I admire the long article about how CDC was unable to handle even in a satisfactory way the Covid-19 crisis. CDC budget cuts are led by Republicans who want to end most governmental involvement in science(except the laughable space force). They do not believe in climate change although more than 95% of climate scientists have shown its existence. They probably won't believe in it even when all the polar ice in the world has melted. Republicans are against almost all forms of regulation. Remember, the CDC is a branch of the federal government. That is now managed by Trump and his cronies. The CDC is an extension of the White House because Trump will not allow it to be independent. Mr Azar of Homeland Security does the scientific naysayer-in-chief's bidding. The long list of career professionals at CDC are muzzled in speaking the truth, demoted or have resigned. Here is the problem with CDC in a nutshell, the Trump administration and Trump's massively incompetent managers at CDC have infected it with vicious, self-serving right-wing politics. The CDC is currently on life support, and the prognosis is grave."

""The government is the problem"" mentality coupled with the belittling of ""experts"" who couldn't possibly be afforded the trust to be authorities in their fields.

And throw Trump into the mix.  The poster child of every wrong headed conservative trend wrapped up in one human being.

In hindsight we all saw 2020 coming..."
2020-06-03 16:43:06,"The CDC has excellent scientists and talent. The issue is mismanagement at senior levels. My guess is mid-level managers have been encouraging right action and the political/top layer unable to navigate effectively.

Throwing more money (and blindly) is misuse of public resources.

We must not forget, also, that the esteemed Dr. Gallo was accused of plagiarism and stealing virus/vaccine intel from France. There is a leadership legacy of wanting credit. This needs to be examined if part of the leadership culture of the CDC.

Sweden was pragmatic - they claim to make policy decisions based on ""evidence based science"" and not research or best guesses alone.

The US got too many things tangled - which ultimately made the CDC look foolish, and not entirely the fault of that institution.

The problem is experts did not stay in there swim lane, including Dr. Fauci.

Policy advisors and should weigh and size the findings of scientists but not point to the scientists as making decision, only informing decisions.

Scientists should not make public guidance based on helping the politicians, either. 

The use-entangled the two too much, probably bc of distrust of the Trump Administration but comes at a cost to true public health."
2020-06-03 17:02:52,"The Republicans have made the CDC the Amtrak of public health.  Next is the postal service.  And to all of you seniors who think Trump’s still so wonderful, put him in office for another four years and he’ll be coming for your Social Security and Medicare."

2020-06-03 15:48:13,"The CDC first told the public not to bother wearing masks. True, they were trying to save the mask inventory for health care workers, but still... Now they are telling the public to wear cloth masks, but the cloth masks will only help others. Also not true, except perhaps for the junk ""undershirt masks"" the CDC promoted on its website.

Time for the CDC to only post science-based positions. Then let the politicians do the lying."
2020-06-03 16:27:21,"We should be depending on the CDC for what the CDC can do. I appreciate that they send teams to hot spots composed of people who have the expertise to find the major causes of infection and to assess a  particular staffing or protection situation and find the gaps and recommend changes to make people safer. Many of these recommendations are for a particular location or type of situation.

Other recommendations are general and should have been highlighted by the CDC much before they were. Here I include the knowledge that infected people transmit the disease before they are symptomatic. We saw news of this from China in February. Yet nursing homes were rotating regular and professional staff (nurses, physical therapists) through facilities for months, and maybe still do. 

I don't understand the mindset that still keeps the CDC (and the FDA) from certifying tests that have been in widespread effective use in other countries so that we could increase our supply. The CDC royally blew it with its inability to produce tests and has since compounded the difficulty of using them. 

Thank God for Deborah Birx and Nancy Messonier.

The CDC is not responsible for the fragile supply chain for our equipment and supplies. They should not have to think of all the sensible things like not having too many people on a beach. I guess the governor was looking for absolution in case he called for guidelines and people got sick."
2020-06-03 17:03:36,"I am surprised CDC's emergency response fell short of expectations. Presumably, the CDC has conducted mock emergencies in conjunction with federal, state and local governments. The shortcomings should have been detected when those emergency response plans were tested.

Of course, no plan could have anticipated dealing with the most incompetent president in American history."

2020-06-03 17:05:21,"The failure of the CDC was, at least in regard to screening passengers from abroad, abetted by the incompetence of DHS personnel at airports who were responsible for screening. I had several friends and relatives who were in Europe,  South America and Asia when the pandemic began and who immediately returned to the States. Every one of them reported being told before they boarded their flights and in the air that they would have to be screened on arrival as well as submit a signed questionnaire that was distributed in flight , and every one of them found themselves being waived through checkpoints by TSA personnel who refused to accept the questionnaires distributed in flight as they arrived in Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and JFK."
2020-06-03 17:36:55,"It is still shocking to me that we are months into this pandemic, hobbled by FDA-approved antibody tests that didn't work, and still don't have a standard testing-tracing capability.

It should have been easy two months ago to locate people who actually had contracted COVD-19 and recovered, and then to test them at intervals for antibody levels.

It isn't just the CDC that has looked disorganized and inept.  The entire US Government has looked as if no one knows what they are doing.  The suspicion clouding this entire pandemic is  that fear of finding bad news has motivated the US government's refusal to look for any news at all."

But what to the Trump gang were leaks were when the CDC released facts that did not 
enthusiastically back up the administration's lies - even though the CDC often suppressed or misrepresented facts to bow to the President. And there is no evidence that Trump and his aides cared about dislocation beyond its likely effect on the 2020 election. 
This would be a better study of what happened if you included how the Republicans made it happen. They dismissed the task force designed to deal with a pandemic and replaced competent administrators and scientists with Creationist hacks like Dr. Redfield."

2020-06-03 15:55:40,"So many assumptions, in particular that previous scenarios told them what to expect for this virus.

The CDC seemed to be treat the development of the test as if they had all the time in the world, polishing the fire truck even as people began reporting smoke.

And some assumptions were the product of painting themselves in the corner:  they had to assume --or hope-- that asymptomatic spread wasn't the case because they didn't have enough tests to do anything else.

Worse, he has either replaced experienced leadership with those lacking experience, left positions unfilled or simply ignored their advice and deep knowledge.

As an collection of mostly publicly known facts, opinions and anecdotes from officials and health-care providers, it's fine reportage. However, having read to the end, I am still left guessing about the answer to my question.

Clearly the CDC's IT resources are pathetically inadequate. Why? Not too hard to guess - other Federal agencies (FAA, IRS,..) in desperate need of cutting-edge IT have made do with inadequate staff and out-of-date equipment, requests for upgrades having been rejected in poor OMB and Congressional decision-making. Is that what happened here? In detail? I'd rather not guess, but I'm still guessing. Ditto about CDC's gross comm failures, apparent inability to integrate info from the rest of the world, etc. A reader can guess, but for deeper digging and analysis I suppose we have to wait for Laurie Garrett..."

He then rebuilds the team with ideologues, careerists and ciphers who can be more easily bent to his will. Then he governs from day to day with the attention span of a house fly.

The article also does not mention the drastic reduction in CDC staff assigned to China to monitor diseases.  I have still never read why or how this happened.

While the article primarily focuses on the CDC,  its role can only be understood in relation to that the of National Security Council which had the responsibility of preparing for and coordinating a response to a pandemic.  What was the impact of eliminating the four staff members whose duties were to do this?

The NSC staff had prepared a plan to deal with a pandemic.  I have read very little about it - other than that it was never used.  I would like to know more about what it said, how that compares with what happened, and why it was never followed.  I would also like to know more about why that staff was eliminated.

Much has been reported about the pandemic - yet there are gaping holes in the coverage."
2020-06-03 17:18:13,"This article identifies three problems: internal CDC operations, the formulation of public policy in response to the Covid 19 pandemic, and Trump. Trump confuses and confounds--notwithstanding his large impact on the formulation of public policy, it is necessary to tune him out and hope for the best this fall. But the other problems will remain

The CDC failed w/o regard to Trump, and, after reading this article, I still don't know why. FDA Chair Hahn said that, after discovering the contamination that ruined the CDC's early test kits, he would have shut down their lab if it had been in the private sector. Huge problem. Budget cuts? Loss of ability to attract quality techs to CDC? Something(s) else? The inability of the CDC to collect, analyze, and disseminate data in real time--same questions. The lack of judgment at all levels?

Even if the CDC were operating as it did in the 1970s, I don't want it dictating public policy on shutdowns of schools, businesses, and the rest. The role of the CDC is to speak loudly, clearly, and independently, and then the policymakers--remember Congress and state legislatures??--weigh the evidence, balance competing considerations, and make informed choices.

I fear that the CDC has lost its way, joining the growing list of dysfunctional agencies that includes DHS, secret service,  FAA, SEC, FDA, and the US Navy, as well as many local police depts. At bottom, maybe it's our fault, given our hatred for govt and deification of the private sector."
2020-06-03 15:52:21,"As a physician and a professor of Medicine, I have always had high regard for the CDC... and still do.  But unquestionably, the CDC has failed to adequately lead in this crisis.  I have no reason to doubt that the scientists, physicians and other dedicated workers there are as capable as they have always proven to have been.  My sense is that the Director, Dr. Redfield, has been the wrong person to lead at this time.  I have no reason to doubt his scientific credentials, but his communication skills have been very poor.  He has failed to generate a sense of confidence and clarity.  My opinion is that it is time for him to move on and be replaced by a more ""Fauci-esque"" or ""Cuomo-esque"" kind of director."
2020-06-03 16:18:58,"I can barely think of a reason why things would not go wrong here. It's not cynicism. It's the nature of certain kinds of crisis - war, pandemic, hurricane, earthquake. Preparedness is a virtue and a responsibility, but it's naive to think that if we had only prepared better it would have been ok. War never goes ok and it always goes wrong, even when you ""win"".

That said, it would help if, as a culture, we held our government in greater esteem, and that might be more possible if it were more in service of the public and less in service of corporations. Institutions like the CDC are collateral damage in that lack of faith."

Why did they issue that advice? They had no evidence regarding the routes of transmission. The prudent advice would have been to adopt all precautions (masks, social distancing, lock downs, etc) initially then relax those as evidence was gathered."
2020-06-03 17:09:55,"The CDC did not do a good job.  In describing why, this article gets some things right, and some things wrong.

The article assigns blame to the Trump administration.  Some of this is appropriate, but the article over does it. The CDC also did a less than stellar job during the Ebola outbreak of 2014, which was during the Obama administration. The Trump administration politicizes everything, which makes the job of Federal agencies difficult. But the press and media also very much contribute to the political infighting. It has become blood sport among some national reporters to identify government officials whose words can used in a headline to disparage Trump, whether appropriate or not. All too often, this contributes to the problems described in this article.

A case can also be made that the liberal media’s obsession with the impeachment of Trump for the entire month of January created a distraction that grew to affect pretty much the entire Federal government. This may have slowed recognition of the threat posed by the corona virus at all levels of our government.

It must also be noted that a big part of the problem is the design of the entire public health system of the US, in which most authority is held at the state and county level, not nationally.

Especially when we see the CDC's recent poor performance.

The problem? The appointment of Robert Redfield (long associated with Evangelicals and also accused of scientific misconduct in his Army AIDS research) by one Donald Trump in March 2018.

Another example of Trump playing to his Evangelical base, and the CDC and now the American people are the losers.

2020-06-03 13:26:19,Trump has put a WH lawyer in charge of disbursing funds for pandemic relief. This is just the latest in a sequence of stupid decisions to weaken an agency whose members are obviously unable to speak the truth.

2020-06-03 13:44:47,"This review of what's happened so far is necessary, but I'm skeptical of placing so much blame on the CDC for not stopping the virus in its tracks. 

No one's done that though a handful of countries with different cultures and gov's did much better than we have. And we're all geniuses on Monday morning, but we should learn of course.

But I'd say the root problem was & is an incompetent moron in the White House.

He said he thought testing was overrated & that the virus would disappear. And drinking bleach would help.

We all know he accepts no guidance or input from anyone unless it is adoration & praise of his greatness. Redfield & other top administrative people had an impossible job trying to appease an ignorant dictator.

And as the authors said:
The CDC agency, a division of Health and Human Services with 11,000 employees, cannot make policy, but it guides federal & state public health systems and advises government leaders.

I'd say for the most part their doctors and scientists are great, but the politically appointed leaders had to show obsequious deference to tump.

And of course trump didn't sit down with Redfield & other experts in Feb and say ""the Fed gov will lead and coordinate the effort, what can we do to massively ramp up testing immediately, get ppe & ventilators to hospitals immediately, trace & quarantine people""...etc. ""And we'll pay for it.""

This review is important & we all must learn...but the failure is largely on Trump. Less on the CDC in my view."

So let's not forget this administrations complete failure in the performance of their duties under law in overseeing and performing the annually mandated review of the CDC SNS. President Trump, Alex Azar, Robert Redfield and Robert Kadlec are are guilty of criminal malfeasance in their mishandling of the CDC SNS.
Trump again has obstructed justice by removing HHS IG who had started an investigation into the CDC SNS failure matter.
I believe it is time for the HHS administration positions to become congressional appointments, that would be a more
permanent position, based on appropriate qualifications and not just positions based on possible political cronyism.
Alex Azar was a pimp for the big pharma industry. He also ran Elli USA(Elli-Lilly). Immediatley after becoming head of Elli he raised company's price on insulin resulting in deaths of Americans that after dramatic price increase could not afford their insulin. Alex Azar is a corporate lawyer.

The SNS seemed to function appropriately in 2009-2012 H1N1 pandemic?

The result has been an admin that is a total failure and run by a racist, bigot, xenophobe, misogynist, a pathological liar and a malignant narcissist.
GOP leadership has failed America is such a big way that it is difficult to put into words. 
It is imperative that not only black Americans but also empathetic and progressive white voters come out in large numbers in November and vote most ,if not all, Republicans out of local, state, and national office. We need to do this together.
Only then, hopefully, will the GOP give up their attempts to transform America into a fascist state as they have over the past 50 years since the Reagan administration.

The CDC is full strength, what has not happened is a beneficial import from foreign experts who tirelessly have something critical to say.  

It's my feeling that the medical world is better of distinctly separate by country - allows circulation for all people involved within a country preserves its constituents and people, residents etc.  Right now there are foreign showdowns and flexing where they are not wanted or needed; no, nope, and never will we change what we did not learn from within ourselves.  The Press Agency is selling out our job markets daily, we looked around wondering who all we heard was typing.

Somehow the plot to dismantle medicine is going wrong, but the main thorough-fare remains the Department of Health.  This is not ER the sitcom, we don't head in with knives and carve out body parts.  Looters do that ...  

The C.D.C handles medical waste product and toxic substances found in the dead, so they are medicine yes, but of the kind you should think about very carefully about. Since CDC sites are not only full of dead people, they have other dead-animals; why, do you wish to approach them at all, when the States know what's going on before they do!

However, I will say that Trump effectively hamstringing the CDC by cutting their funding and replacing their leadership didn't do anyone any favors. Either way, I will liken this to my time in service in Iraq and Afghanistan. When traversing mountainous terrain, we were being outmaneuvered by the enemy. We were ponderous and slow, weighed down by our gear. The enemy was fleet-footed and traveled light, sometimes even barefooted.  In my analogy, the American soldier is the CDC and the Insurgency is the virus. There has to be a more adaptive and ingenious approach to tracking epidemics, if a high-school kid can figure out how to compile data faster and more efficiently than your bureaucrats, then there is a problem. p.s.

When it was decided that we could not wait for days to receive the results, various laboratories in our province were approved to do analysis locally and coordinated their work.  The result: Our province of 5 million people has 2,573 confirmed cases and 165 deaths to date.  Louisiana, same population, has 40,746 cases and 2,764 deaths in the same time period.  Our government has let the public health officials lead the charge, listening to qualified people and letting them do the work they were trained to do.

Given that the focus is on CDC and not the entire federal government, it would still be helpful to have some sense of where the boundary lines are between CDC and Dr. Fauci's unit and the Surgeon General among others."
2020-06-03 16:04:40,"The CDC especially screwed up early on when they discouraged the public from wearing masks.

2020-06-03 18:19:00,"The current administration is not committed to ensuring a strong, effective federal response in time of crisis.  That's what went wrong.  We saw it early on when Trump told governors to meet their state's need for ventilators.

A  federally-led, well-coordinated response was urgently needed,
but not forthcoming."
2020-06-03 18:21:24,When is the last time our Congress carefully investigated the well functioning and exercised serious oversight of the CDC ? Without such oversight we can only depend on past and current Administrations  exercising oversight. Sadly CDC has never ranked high in major importance for our Federal Govt. We’ve paid the price.
2020-06-03 18:22:48,"I had a career as a government scientist,  and the problems at the CDC are similar to many issues I encountered. Many long-term government scientists were trained in a pre-computer age and were extremely reluctant to embrace any sort of IT advances, so until very recently all the data was on EXCEL spreadsheets. When contractors were called in to create applications, the resulting systems were so opaque and user unfriendly I could only conclude  they were designed to force the government to be dependent  on support system contracts with the contractors. The agency's basic IT infrastructure was up to date, but many of the scientific  systems were not. Also, it was dangerous to connect sensitive scientific instruments to the government network because, for example, automatically installed IT patches could disaable the instrument software. In addition to having numerous incompetent staff members, we were only staffed at a level to keep up with routine levels of workload. Even competent employees would stake out territories  of which tasks they were willing to do (foot-dragging was confused with professionalism). Most basically, there was an overwhelming fog of complacency, the attitude that it didn't  matter what you did or didn't  do, you would still get a big pension in the end."

2020-06-03 17:32:22,"Let’s move beyond what came before to look at what the CDC has told, through Fauci or other channels, the American public since covid-19 hit our shores. They lied to us about masks and were enabled in that lie by a press (this paper) that was either consciously fine with the lie, lacking proper skepticism, or stupid. Dr. Fauci told people to go on cruises. Now, with economic collapse staring us down, we are told that the virus doesn’t spread via surfaces. Is this true? Or another lie meant to manipulate the public to do what the government desires?

We do not know! And we cannot trust a press that has approached this issue like sheep. Now we are finally seeing some acknowledge this may have been developed in a lab and that the wet market theory is out. As if legitimate people outside the mainstream press have not been saying it for months.

Why bother talking about the CDC. Ask yourselves why your paper has devolved into being nothing but a mouthpiece for governmental and cultural elites on every issue down the line. This paper has no skepticism. It is quite literally publishing pieces by journalists complaining about how hard it is to be a journalist. You are supposed to protect us. Where are you?"
2020-06-03 18:49:16,"Exceptional Management practices long ago learned to separate front line from support staff, but to also ensure communications, coordination and cooperation among them. No organization or institution of scientists, researchers and medical experts should be run by them alone; they need to do what they are good at, with the support of capable, resourced administrative experts for communications, crisis management, IT, finance, HR, etc. And agencies, institutions and organizations like the CDC should be never be subject to political manipulation; and they should be well-resourced enough to maintain best practices for things like data management. Bureaucracy and inbred hierarchy are the death of effective management."
2020-06-03 19:02:45,"Fortunately there is good and useful research being done in Europe and elsewhere.  All of it is available, but not necessarily in English.  The best thing the CDC can do with their limited means is hiring a translator.  We can learn, for example, that young children play a very limited role in the spread of the virus.  Keeping elementary schools closed may be doing more harm than good at this point.  We can also learn, for example, about a procedure that is under development for predicting how severe the disease will progress if you were to get infected.  Such a procedure would offer an alternative way of easing the lockdown for people who are not at risk of developing severe symptoms.  And so on and so forth."
2020-06-03 19:15:33,"This article lays out in clear terms so many of the failures of the CDC and the administrations that starved funding for CDC and public health.

2020-06-03 18:57:25,"I've noticed the CDC since I got sick after a virus in '85 & never got better.
Usually CDC starts off by making all kinds of mistakes. Once corrected, usually a good job is done. 
This happened with: 
- Legionnaire's Disease (they assumed it was viral & killed off all the bacteria in the samples they tested. But it was bacterial. For months, they could find no cause, until by accident they forgot to kill the bacteria. After that, the disease wasn't a problem, but people died in the meantime.), 
- Ebola (nurses got sick, because of inaccurate guidelines), &
- HIV.
They are very arrogant & know-it-all, when listening to foreign doctors' advice (talk about systemic racism, they dismissed what the doctors in Africa advised for Ebola & doctors in China, Iran & Italy for Covid19)
However, I have never seen anything like this: where they are being held back from doing their job by our own government. Saw a bit of that with HIV, but it seemed more to do with prejudices against certain people who got HIV; not presidents seeing truth about a disease as a personal attack.
Had CDC had been allowed to do their job w/ Covid19, you still would have had botched initial tests causing unnecessary deaths, but then CDC would have corrected things & assisted in reducing not only deaths in the USA, but in the world. Like they did w/ Ebola. 
This pandemic shows what happens, when you have poor leadership & government agencies are not allowed to do their jobs."

A President that is so incredibly ignorant about anything remotely scientific that doesn't even have a clue what the CDC does, and shut down President Obama's pandemic response task force. This is what went wrong.

In late 2014 they issues a draft recommendation that Americans males should get circumcised, based on very flawed African studies.  The 40 countries with better health care, lower HIV and almost no circumcision had no trouble denouncing this as highly biased, unwise, unscientific  advice.  After all the headlines and press attention, the CDC recommendations were never issued. Oops. The 2020 COVID testing fiasco is another example. Too bad--we need a competent CDC more than ever."

2020-06-03 18:55:05,"The scientists at the C.D.C. are still great,” Dr. Jha said. “It’s very puzzling to all of us why C.D.C. performance has been so poor.”
You answered this implied question implicitly to the satisfaction of those with the patience to read it:
        1) erosion of resources through years of funding cuts
        2) lack of empowerment from leadership
1) An agency can only survive so many budget cuts and unfunded mandates before it is unable to achieve even its day-to-day work, let alone maintain and improve its infrastructure and systems.  I blame the tea party and tax pledge idiots, but maybe that's too easy.
2) Toxic leaders are threatened by technical personnel dedicated to codes, science, or environmental law rather than personal loyalty.  The results are rigidly vertical organizations that create sclerotic bottlenecks. 

Successful agencies are serendipitous combinations of executive and legislative support, combined with smart, dedicated leaders.  For example, few of us even noticed the remarkable improvements in the weather reports under Dr Robert M White's stewardship of the US Weather Service and NOAA or contemplated the extensive benefits to America and beyond.  If we want a good CDC, maybe we will have to pay more attention, but the people are there to make it happen."
2020-06-03 19:12:52,"Let us review just four facts and then decide what to do about CDC. More facts can be added as needed.
1. Agencies with such meager resources as WHO could produce a successful SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test, but CDC messes it up, with ""sloppy lab practices"".
2. A ""High Schooler"" could create a website, better than CDC to get COVID 19 cases data.
3. CDC messes up total infected data by combining antibody test data with the regular test data.
4. Proof of non-symptomtic people carrying virus and infecting others was plain in sight in early February. In fact right after that I bought two N-95 masks. Yet venerable Fauci says on 2 March (recording exists), that those who ""do not have symptoms"", need not wear the masks. (Fauci, are you living under a rock? A no medico like me knows about non-symptomatic people spreading infections and you do not?). Then, CDC recommends face covering by end of March, when infection has spread possibly to half a million people by then. And of course, where will people get masks? there were none to be found.
I am sure I can drudge up more to add to this list proving lousy CDC performance. But tis would be enough for now. 
However broken, we need CDC right now. But once dust settles, there must be mass firings at CDC and HHS, after a commission investigates all evidences of utter failure. CDC head should resign now or choose a more convenient date."

Amateur Hour at the CDC while an administration so full to the gunnels with too many Neros...didn't even have enough Fiddles to play as Rome burned. 

Aging infrastructure (why is this such a constant and recurring theme in America in so many areas from voting machines, river levees, bridges, transport and communication channels to name just a few?) lack of coordination and comunication, distrust, and multiple failures of form , function and action ...just lap at the edges of what are obviously systematic failures at almost every point in the agencies reason for being and contract with its people and country.

And amidst it all, we are told that a Seattle Teenager collated, collected and dispersed pandemic critical data faster and better than the agency whose actual name is supposed to be what it clearly isn't : The Center for Disease Control.

Disney should sue the CDC for copyright theft and illegal usage...the Mickey Mouse Show is clearly a Disneyland Trademark and not the CDC management & admin department ...though one can see why it could be mistaken for one ...in an agency that cannot afford or be allowed to make as many mistakes it has .

The cost has been unacceptably high and unprecedented and must NEVER be allowed to happen again...NEVER."
2020-06-03 18:09:16,"The CDC is a shadow of its former self.  Dr. Redfield is not qualified to lead the agency, and he should have turned Trump down when selected to head it.  Trump and his aides have put enormous pressure on CDC that would be hard to grapple with for any competent leader, with their demands to defy reality and their placing limits on what CDC can say and do.  But the agency has been underfunded for years without getting the kind of support from Congress that it really needs.  This was a disaster in the making and a perfect storm with an incompetent POTUS surrounded by toadies who keep saying what they think Trump wants to hear.  I do not think this will get any better until Trump is out of the White House and we have a competent leader who will appoint competent, experienced people and will respect science."
2020-06-03 18:48:39,"Excellent piece.
Redfield has never been up to the job, was yet another inadequate unskilled Trump appointee & he, along with Trump, are responsible for a great many dead Americans. Imagine the difference if Schuchat was in charge, & if we all had heard more from Messonnier."
2020-06-03 18:48:46,"Sadly, the CDC utterly failed us in this pandemic. Early on it became clear it was not up to the task. In late March, two weeks after we had decided to self-isolate in south Florida, a JetBlue flight from White Plains carrying a coronavirus positive patient landed at Ft. Lauderdale airport. A local health official and a CDC rep took the patient off from the rear of the plane, then allowed the patient and his family to disappear into south Florida with nothing more than a suggestion to self-quarantine. When questioned about it by a local news reporter, the health official’s response: “We followed CDC guidelines.” At that point I realized CDC “guidance” would be useless and we were on our own as to how we should protect ourselves.

Never has a bureaucracy been so inept at providing critically important direction. Even a simple recipe for homemade hand sanitizer would have been helpful. One week the CDC said wearing masks by the public was unnecessary, but the following week it updated its guidance recommending masks be worn by the general public. We had already decided to do so based on the behavior of citizens in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore - places familiar with fast spreading viruses. 

Why our own CDC was so unprepared is scandalous and worthy of a Congressional investigation. Weeks of reports from Asia and Italy gave fair warning, but they were missed by the one organization that should have been tuned in."

2020-06-03 18:23:14,"I have been a medical writer and editor for more than 30 years. During that time, I have considered the CDC to be a trustworthy source of information, dispassionate and informed. Last week, a friend asked me for advice on cleaning her businesses to prevent COVID-19 infections. I referred her to the relevant CDC webpage. But I felt, for the first time, that I needed to add a caveat. She should bear in mind that this was the Trump CDC so the advice might not be accurate."

2020-06-03 18:10:04,"This was the end result of a serious political neglect of public health.  Trump was in the process of cutting public health spending to stem the rising national debt due to corporate tax cuts and stupidly extreme defense spending.  It seemed to me that the US was under the misconception that the virus could be contained in China.  Trump though is the primary culprit for the USs failure to stop the corona virus.  Trump's paranoid idea that politicians were using the pandemic to harm him politically has never been allayed.  The CDC has brilliant scientists locked in antiquated procedures unable to communicate effectively with state and local public health officials.  The corona virus is still not understood fully.  One thing is certain, the public health is the most important national security issue politicians should deal with.  More than aircraft carriers and corporate tax cuts."
2020-06-03 18:12:35,"We've really slipped.  Our repeated election of people who say that shrinking the government is the best way to go has finally caught up to us.  Will having such a dysfunctional government teach us a lesson?  Probably not.  We're too fond of saying that the other guy/gal has to be responsible for him/herself and we won't spend the money to enable him/her.  We don't like poor people and the programs we design to help them show it.  We make it very difficult for people dig themselves out of a hole but easy to fall into it.

And then we elect someone like Trump, McConnell, etc., because we like what they say.  Maybe we should pay more attention to what they've done before we elect and anoint them."

Well guess what? They all signed the pledge; and the CDC drowned in the bathtub."

The CDC needs a Information Technology (IT) blood transfusion.“The C.D.C. could not produce accurate counts of how many people were being tested, compile complete demographic information on confirmed cases or even keep timely tallies of deaths. Backups on at least some of these systems are made on recordable DVDs, a technology that was state-of-the-art in the late 1990s.”"
2020-06-03 19:16:09,"Maybe if the CDC hadn't diverted its attention from infectious diseases to social problems like addiction and obesity, it would have been better prepared for this moment."
2020-06-03 18:42:10,"I hate to see this happen to the CDC.  We certainly need that kind of expertise.

This article does not give enough of the blame to the failure at the top, which is  responsible for a lot of the guidance issues.  They were not funded to prepare for this pandemic, there was no national coordination by the administration, so whatever they did could be second guessed or contradicted, and was.  Remember Trump saying the governors were on there own for supplies?  So, the CDC responds by trying to limit where they were used, because there were nowhere near enough.  And hospital administrators were not allowing public disclosure about how this affected the heathcare workers and the patients.

It is hard to know how a public health agency can do their job with this kind of total failure from the top."
2020-06-03 19:00:38,"""The C.D.C., long considered the world’s premier health agency""  

At this point, I am hard pressed to take seriously any suggestion that a US institution is the ""world's premier (whatever) agency"".  You have spent the last 40 years gutting your public service, and the rest of the world has moved on.  

Time to abandon any suggestion of US exceptionalism and take  your place at the back of the line."
2020-06-03 18:13:08,"Unfortunately this massive failure by CDC shouldn’t come as a surprise. Besides the horrible bureaucracy you’d expect, there is a pattern of irrationally decision making for at least the last 20 years. CDC’s leadership has failed to make basic risk assessments repeatedly. Some of these poor decisions fortunately didn’t result in harm. Others were millions or even a billion dollar mistakes. With COVID 19, their incompetence will add trillions to the deficit and cost tens of thousands of extra deaths. I worked with CDC regularly for 15 years. As a private physician,I routinely beat them in identifying and treating infectious and nutritional diseases they had a branch of individuals paid to perform. I did this and shared my data pro bono repeatedly. All while seeing patients full time as well.  They at times still struggled with what a rationale teenager could do. Occasionally despite spoon feeding the CDC with data and rational response measures, medical providers and multiple States would have to ignore their incompetence to mitigate unnecessary risk. Unfortunately this risk isn’t always able to be minimize without their leadership having any semblance of risk assessment abilities. Look at Ebola, H1N1 and H3N2. Those were all billion dollar mistakes. If anyone is surprised their mistakes now cost us trillions, they aren’t familiar with the CDC or they don’t think rationally."

Well, what data scientist or engineer worth their salt  who can get a job at any cutting edge company would even want to waste their time getting through CDC's Byzantine and tortuous job application process, only likely to be rejected by some HR person who's been at their job for 25+ years and likely doesn't even understand most of the terms on the applicant's resume?"
2020-06-03 18:45:41,"What went wrong was there was an administration in power that felt addressing the possibility of a pandemic was not in the best interest of a president who was dependent on attending rallies.
They decided to do everything in their power to hamper any logical attempts to prevent the spread of the virus because it would interfere with their re-election campaign.
Add to that the dismantling of many government agencies, the replacement of seasoned professionals with inexperienced kowtowing toadies and an absolutely irresponsible decision to advise against face covering.
Regardless of all the other failures, these outright attempts to sabotage an effective response to downplay the severity were the biggest reason the CDC failed to fulfill its intended purpose."
2020-06-03 19:01:31,"CDC's failure was not just a moment. Sure the initial failure was a big one and a huge cause for failure in testing. But even after the failure at CDC was found, talked about publicly, they failed to ramp up for at least another month. What was that about? To this day, CDC is not quite catching up to the standards we see in the rest of the world. To me, that question is a more important one. Why were the obvious, identifiable mistakes not corrected?"
2020-06-03 19:10:40,"All through the article, I thought of one thing: lack of leadership. I went to the CDC's Website a few weeks back, and they were 20K behind in tracking deaths.  It's better now, but that was absurd. 

We ought to know every morning how many people in this country are hospitalized with COVID, how many are in critical condition, and what the trends are. We should have known this daily for the past 3 months. It is low tech counting, and some of us old people know how to do it.

Not only was Dr. Redfield the wrong person for the job but it goes back to the President, as it should. Redfield was picked by DJT. Elections matter.  Vote in anti-science people, bad things happen. Have a president who requires a certain message, not the truth, and you get a task force led by the VP that came out the first week with one of the silliest flow charts I've ever seen, never got caught up with testing, flailed around with the mask issue, and was more concerned about assuaging Trump than helping people.  

The FDA was also complicit in shutting down UW's excellent work and putting us further behind the power curve.

The CDC may have nice buildings and good scientists, but in the absence of effective leadership from Washington, it failed us. When you vote this November, remember that sometimes pocketbook issues that people vote on are often affected by other matters that aren't often thought about.  Like Covid."
2020-06-03 18:34:42,"What went wrong?  Group think. Making assumptions based on nothing. How could a virus spread so rapidly from touch without an airborne component?
Emphasis on hand washing but not masks. 
Refusal to accept WHOs test. Delay in CDC developing their test. 


Then there’s the White House putting a heavy thumb on the scale, perverting the entire process. Scientists bending to the whims of an uneducated, conspiracist, with prejudices based on gut instincts?  Offering anecdotal cures, failing to coordinate state response, refusing to take responsibility. 
Could any results other than disaster be expected?"

2020-06-03 18:18:03,"I am a public official. This has been a DIY CDC experience for hospitals, states, businesses of every size and cities. There have been millions of wasted hours and dollars, as all kinds of organizations reinvent the wheel - in a deadly pandemic, when time cost lives. 50 States cannot suddenly be ad-hoc CDCs, but they are trying, in 50 different ways. The Center for Disease Control exists to CONTROL DISEASE, act as an expert and a clearinghouse for information for all Americans. I find this article to be quite flattering considering how many Americans have died for lack of government coordination."
2020-06-03 18:28:57,"We see in the CDC's responses to public health emergencies that their advice tends to be crafted to make people feel safe despite the presence of a health threat. We always thought we could depend on them to keep us informed with scientific facts, but we find that they are mainly in the panic avoidance business, trying to manage the public with calming reassurances when warnings are what's needed. With covid, they've expanded their mission to having to manage Trump's ego, making the CDC doubly hopeless.

One of the CDC's more preposterous bits of advice intended to make us feel safe and calm is their definition of a ""contact""—that is, an encounter that poses a risk of being infected—as fifteen minutes (!) in close proximity to an infected person. Then last week they told us you can't pick up the virus from surfaces. (So we may ease up on the hand washing and sanitizing?) A few more like that and the CDC will have succeeded in demonstrating there there is no pandemic at all.

I no longer trust the CDC or expect sound advice from them. I turn to foreign public health services where American politicians aren't interfering."
2020-06-03 18:11:28,"For anyone to think that our inability to properly fund our government is not really important, this article should be an eye opener.  It isn’t just our highways, bridges, airports, schools, and trains that are outdated and worn out, it is all of our infrastructure including our bureaucratic systems.  Our political inability to tax our wealthy and corporate citizens to a level to allow this has come back to haunt us.  We must rebuild, we must invest in the USA. Yes, some of the money will advantage those we don’t agree with politically or socially, but if we expect to excel or even survive, we MUST invest in the future of this country."
2020-06-03 18:50:40,I would say the biggest single issue is they were working for someone who does not believe in science.  Who uses every agency of the government as a political tool for himself.  No one could succeed in such a situation.  Why do you think the turnover in the Trump administration has been so high?
2020-06-03 19:06:35,"This article highlights:
* Congress did not resource rebuilding of the sensor, signaling, and analysis infrastructure of public health the way it did EHRs
* CDC with 1980s communication infrastructure would always struggle but
* US shift to global (non-US) medical supply chains removed all power to respond to the 2019-nCoV pandemic
* So any recommendations by CDC would not be executable by Trump administration or the states and hospitals.  Use N95s would just cause panic when it was realized there weren't any
* Redfield was unable to stand up to Trump - but what would he have insisted.  The problems were caused years before.  

The congress should review this carefully and learn a hard lesson, but it will probably be impeded by politics :("
2020-06-03 19:19:03,"Excellent analysis and reporting, but why bury the leads? As the last quarter of the article shows, longstanding underfunding of public health and undermining and silencing of the CDC by the White House (which continues) hobbled its response:

""For years, federal and state governments have not invested enough money to insure that the nation’s public health system would have critical data needed to respond in a pandemic. Since 2010, for example, grants to help hospitals and states prepare for emergencies have declined.

In 2019, more than 100 public health groups pressed congressional leaders to allocate $1 billion...to upgrade the infrastructure. The C.D.C. received $50 million toward the effort this year.. [and] $500 million under the emergency CARES Act.""
And
""Already under siege for problems with the agency’s diagnostic test, C.D.C. officials watched with growing alarm as Mr. Trump, facing criticism for his administration’s response, repeatedly undermined the agency.""

“There comes a time,” said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, who served as C.D.C. director in the Clinton and Bush administrations, “when it makes it very hard to operate effectively, when things are being suggested, requested, ordered that you think are contrary to the containment of the pandemic.”
....
""The president and his aides viewed the civil servants at the C.D.C. — many of whom had worked under presidents from both parties — as disloyal liberals eager to wound Mr. Trump politically by leaking to the press..."""
2020-06-03 19:03:41,"Notably lacking from this article is any mention of the CDC’s role in shutting down the southern border to people other than citizens and legal permanent residents (first through an interim final rule that gave the CDC the power to restrict travel of persons based on health-related concerns, and then through successive applications of that rule to the entire border based on concerns about coronavirus entering the U.S. through neighboring countries). How does the CDC’s overtly political policy (which doesn’t appear to have had any meaningful impact on the spread of the virus, given that the U.S. has exponentially more cases than Mexico and Central American countries) fit within this article’s narrative about a largely apolitical and expertise-driven agency?"
2020-06-03 19:30:40,"A big part of the CDC problem was related to precursor chemicals and reagents for both intact viral and eventually pcr based covid-19 test development. Basically, no building blocks we needed were produced here anymore and getting what we needed fast enough from other countries was not so easy. Past administrations new the importance on being self reliant. All this manufacturing was done here in the USA until Trump moved everything overseas."
2020-06-03 19:21:41,"The screw up of CDC has been previously covered extensively on this New York Times.  How CDC beginning with its top official Dr. Robert R. Redfield had failed, along with white house health chief Alex Azar, among others.  Oh, Don't forget their boss, Trump.  How about his surgeon general Jerome Adams and Fauci.  Its a bunch of incompetent fails that led to his spectacular disaster.  And I thank NYT for the insight based on my reading of prior accounts of how this gaffe unfolded.  Its not just budget, equipment nor lack of personnel.  Its human errors and negligence, and recklessness at that.  We have CDC and leaders not even third world country will want.  When there is lazy (criminally) and incompetent people leading the agency and country, the outcome is predicted.  Failure now and failure in the future.  No accountability either."
2020-06-03 19:33:43,"For someone--me, a Democrat--who wants to believe government can rise to the challenges of something like a pandemic and actually work for a people who elect it, this is a depressing story, a bureaucratic nightmare--as well as yet another example of how a disgracefully inept presidential administration screws everything up.  Maybe we need another, better ""re-inventing government"" effort in the phrasing of the Clinton administration, something that deliberately reviews and reforms how public services get delivered.

Surely the complexities of modern society don't need to be even more complicated by the gross mismanagement of the type suggested in this article.  Surely, if democracy was important enuf to the people it served, we could do it much better than what we now regularly experience as failures to launch and execute.  Maybe that's it--""civics"", as we called it when I was in school, just isn't important enuf."

They have been defunded, annually, since the fraud took office (and, of course, HE fired the Obama Pandemic Response Team, and their chains of command), and their leadership has been ""shaky"" for the last few years.
It is beyond absurd they could have committed lab safety violations, which are usually of the RNAse/DNAse kind, and contaminated the tests they had developed.
But the ""administration"" has compounded all their errors by making irrational decisions since January.  THEY refused the offered W.H.O. test kits.  THEY focused on China travel as, simultaneously, and logically, Chinese travelers merely took the eastern route to the U.S., and passed through Europe on the way.  AND our mutton-headed Homeland Security airport personnel on the East coast didn't even bother with checking temperatures of incoming travelers, who had come indirectly from China (which can't catch asymptomatic infections in any event).
There's plenty of blame to go around HERE, not in China."
2020-06-03 19:29:52,"My understanding is Trump pretty much neutered the CDC. Decreasing funding, dismantaling, firings, told what they could and could not put on website or what they were allowed to say!  
In the past they have been on top of most every situation, so 
Why the change Now?"
2020-06-03 19:27:49,"Government agencies and departments get gutted by political infighting. When one of the parties, and it's usually the democrats try to do something good, the republicans spend all their time trying to tear it down. So agencies are always defending against the false criticism of the political opponents of the party that passed legislation. To advance within an agency an employee has to be a political yes man to whatever crazy hoax one or other of the political parties is running as their latest scam. This drives capable people away from government and only leaves those who could do no better than work for the government where their job is safe as long as they never grow a spine. This only happens because those that tear the government down never pay a political price, but rather are usually rewarded for their antigovernment stances. 

Congress hates government workers, especially those of high skill, because they know and tell the truth which is not the same as the politically expedient view of reality. It is mostly the GOP who do this but the democrats are also capable of denying truth when their personal political situation calls for it. It continues because the American people are not informed enough to understand how they might benefit from capable government. I don't want to say it that way. My opinion of the American people is far far lower than what I think the NYTs would allow me to say here. 

The people get the government they vote for and deserve."

2020-06-03 19:39:21,"The problem is that those in power really had no idea dc what the CDC does. The result is this mass confusion. Long before the Covid Crisis, my fellow New Orleanian, Michael Lewis wrote a short book (The Fifth Risk) about how the Trump Administration and all of the Trumpsters feel about all of these agencies. Lewis book was prophetic."
2020-06-03 19:41:18,It's remarkable that the CDC in the early stages of the pandemic did not provide testing to those potentially infected or N95 masks to healthcare workers.  That a teenager provided better data on the virus than the government seems to be the state of the art with all scientific endeavors under the Trump administration.  Why are we waiting until January to get rid of them; hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake.
2020-06-03 19:41:00,"How is it that the CDC has such an antiquated inefficient computer system that it was unable to analyze data and send alerts/warnings to state governments and  public health departments across the country?
I have a feeling that if the computer was this old that it has probably been like this for a long time. We need to look at health care in this country and prioritize public health. The Republicans have been quick to criticize the Canadian health care system and though not perfect,  the death rate from Covid in Canada is extremely low ( 7, 495 deaths). For the most part, provincial  Canadian public health departments have been extremely effective in their development of tests and prevention of spread of the virus. Quite impressive when you think that this has all been done at a fraction of the cost that has been spent in the US."
2020-06-03 19:52:34,"Dr. Redfield may be a fine doctor, but by all accounts he was the wrong person chosen to lead the CDC.

Yet, there has been no focus on holding the CDC accountable and all the focus has instead been on pointing the finger at China or the WHO.

2020-06-03 20:30:26,"I was a government employee for many years. Most of us try to do a good job. But the system often prevents us from doing so. Every few years, new politicians put new bosses (not leaders) in place. Those bosses, to make their mark, try something new and untested and spend half their time rallying the troops with same old, same old and ridiculous vision and values initiatives. Meanwhile, civil service and union rules combine to stop terrible employees from being fired and to prevent great, innovative employees from succeeding. So it is no surprise to us that the CDC was unprepared. There are a thousand no-brainers that could make government work better. But the system never pursues them andso we suffer in big ways—the spread of the virus in nursing homes, and small—potholed roads. Last thought—how different are the senior govt employees and pols who stood by while Covid patients were put in nursing homes among the most susceptible than the very new, young officer who stood by when the senior officer caused the death of Mr Floyd? I am not sure."
2020-06-03 20:07:02,"Assisted living/retirement/nursing care facilities have used CDC guidelines to form their guidelines for care and for liability. This was devastating. 

It has been clear to anyone reading the news that CDC guidelines weren't aggressive enough. For weeks, hand-washing was touted as a reliable preventative; masks weren't recommended until April 3. There still has been little guidance or discussion about asymptomatic carriers. 

Following the CDC's pace, senior facilities were slow to enact aggressive preventative measures. In late March, for instance, my father's lovely assisted living facility (in a major midwestern city) was still conducting one-on-one routine physical therapy sessions without masks. They had an outbreak, which luckily has been controlled, but for over a month, employees appear to have worked in multiple areas of care, bridging areas where the virus had emerged. The facility still relies on temperature checks as the primary line of defense (this is something, but it's far from enough). In daily briefings to families, the facility consistently reiterates that it uses CDC guidelines to shape their policies for care.  

Senior care facilities needed (and still need) immediate, extensive, and much more stringent guidelines, far beyond the few common sense words of advice the CDC offered for public guidance."
2020-06-03 20:01:00,"The CDC failed to appreciate the virus as it was and not as their protocols dictated it be.  In doing so, they failed to contain it and then panic the country into a massive, fear-driven shut down that  was probably unnecessary and remains a lead weight on the economy.

Simply put Covid-19 kills susceptible people 95% of the time. That has been clear from the FIRST reports form Wuhan.  Simple instructions from the CDC:keep the elderly safe and those with significant health problems should self.  Such a simple directive, issued immediately in February -quarantine would have saved THOUSANDS OF LIVES and prevented the need for a massive shut down.

Not reading the evidence and not thinking how the virus behaved in the REAL world as opposed to on out-of-date spreadsheets and bad statistical calculations led to terrible decisions and simply magical thinking recommendations."
2020-06-03 20:01:13,"People today are idealistic when it comes to science. If this episode taught us anything it is how limited science is in its insights and response. Groups like Zuckerberg-Chan say they will ""end all disease"" and Broad Institute want you to believe that its half trillion (tax free) nonprofit dollars will lead it to treat mental health disease. No one can control nature or viruses, or cancers, much less expect to live past 80. It's not realistic. Biology is not a computer system, it is a constantly subject to chaos and disorder, and tradeoffs, etc. If you think people will outlast viruses, you would be wrong."
2020-06-03 20:03:48,"The Center for Disease Control (CDC) Is mainly a Political organization, hiding behind an Ivory tower research vision, hiding behind Federal public health and safety.  All with excellent image and public relations, and not much else.  Instead of being THE national clearing house for disease control, and research statistics in the US, and by extension the world, they try and be all things for all people and utterly fail at all of them. But we must never forget they are primarily a politically controlled organization.  The article goes on about a lack of informational statics and other things that they had not received from other sources, they had the information or enough of it, they were just forbidden, to acknowledge or to publicly disperse data that would further panic the sheepile.  As all real management at CDC  is appointed by politicians who are continuously covering up inconvenient problems, when the master speaks."
2020-06-03 20:09:20,"Hopefully, we can use this disaster to learn from our mistakes and prevent similar ones in the future. That will require an acknowledgement that there were mistakes made. It is very unlikely that anyone in the Trump administration will ever
admit to mistakes of their own, so the only solution seems to be to replace this administration in November and conduct a thorough non-partisan review of all the mistakes that were made. Perhaps then we can be prepared for the next pandemic. 
     If you think this pandemic response has been a disaster, wait until we have to deal with the consequences of climate change If we still have Leaders who use science denial as our main defense."
2020-06-03 20:04:22,"As a long-time retired US Public Health Service officer I'm still in disbelief of this horrid response. When I joined the service, C Everett Koop was the Surgeon General. He offered leadership as AIDS took to the population. He took no lip from Reagan, giving citizens hope. During my career I had good faith in the preparedness of the public health agencies. But alas, leadership matters. Science-based reality is our friend. Microorganisms are humanity's greatest on-going threat and should be constantly prioritized. We all now know the consequences.  The CDC should have been prepared. Elections have consequences."
2020-06-03 20:21:32,"Health organizations  should perform well even under horrendous political leadership . They should follow strict scientific criteria.  And it is obvious that the CDC has failed in collecting data,  in providing it, in giving consistent advise on the nature of covid-19, on mitigation practices, and on advising physicians on how best to treat patients with covid-19. But, it is not yet late to make up for past failures. We are in the middle of this pandemia, and we are still in much need of guidance."

2020-06-03 20:54:23,"This is important reporting and I thank you for it. I feel a need to add an emphasis on how the politicization of the CDC impairs its mission. Even with a more progressive, pro-science Administration (Pres. Obama), Congress intervenes in unhelpful ways. In the mid to late 2000s I was working with community organizations who were working with public health officials to better address the underlying social and economic conditions that contribute to poor health outcomes. Conservatives in Congress did not like the sound of 'community organizers' being involved with public health. The CDC had to remove references to 'community' from its materials. This is one of many examples. How do we insulate agencies like CDC and NIH from politics?"
2020-06-03 20:59:20,"As a former US Public Health Service officer in the 1970s when the EIS and the CDC were internationally acclaimed, I congratulate you all on a great and comprehensive piece of reporting even though it makes my heart break. Alas you omitted one additional politically forced error which accrued to the detriment of us all. Both in meat packing plants and in skilled nursing facilities, the usual early epidemiological investigations led to recommendations for remediation and safety, but due to political pressure the usual firm guidance was hedged, rules were made optional and the investigations were limited to the institutions and did not account for spread into the surrounding communities.  This contributed to many cases and additional deaths."
2020-06-03 20:39:25,"What went wrong? Isn't it clear. Trump intervened. The CDC made him ""look bad"" and so their professional assessments and directions to the public were buried and compromised. Essentially Trump cut the CDC off at the kneesd.  This is what happens when an out-of-control egomaniac mob boss is at the head of our government. 

No official or politician can say anything that could be seen as a negative judgement on Trump for fear of his mighty Twitter Thumbs and his crazy Executive Order (read Royal Decree) threats. Not science, not medicine, not good public policy, not informed action, not even decency and empathy. 

We must restore sanity to our government. Trump must be decisively, thoroughly defeated along with his sycophantic protectors in the feckless Republican Party."

Not a drop of shame or disgrace. And we PAY them.

In fact, there is basically zero accountability and responsibility by the CDC for this total disaster. Even after 106,000 deaths.  So the NYT has Donald Trump to blame.  OK. But Donald Trump didn't micromanage all of the 10,000+ CDC employees. Sorry, that may be convenient politics for you, NYT, but at some point, the CDC employees have to be held accountable for negligence and incompetence.  It is simply a documented fact.  This is THEIR JOB.  This is what they do.  Not Trump, not Pence, not fill-in-the-blank political lightning rod.  This is the CDC's entire mission and reason for existence."

when the first news about the severe pulmonary infections in wuhan where published in the last days of 2019, everyone, who lived with open eyes during the sars 2003 epidemic, knew about the problems to come, the wuhan lockdown was but to regain control in this severe epidemic by quarantine of a whole state.
We all pay our price for the wrong decisions in these days.
To my humble opinion, the American were lead by distrust in the Chinese and lost precious time, as we did in Germany. 
The leading US-problem is an almost nonexistent health care for the unemployed, the poor and aged.
Poverty of minorities, a lack of interest in education and public welfare, underfunded institutions and the unwillingness of all leaders, dems and reps, to correct the social imbalance, underscores this. 
We in Europe do pay tremendous taxes for social stability. This is the backside of the €, cause everything has its price."
2020-06-03 21:09:39,"I am not a epidemiologist or a Doctor but I did work for the old Customs Service and then CBP for more than 32 years.    When I first began working the old Public Health Service still existed and they had actual field officers at ports of entry and public health hospitals to quarantine suspected infectious people.   When the CDC was formed that was all done away with, and they lost a lot of real world experience that would have been helpful in the current pandemic. CBP and TSA could be and should be very helpful in fighting this pandemic, but the lack of holistic planning and training has prevented that from happening.  CBP collects a lot of data on international travelers; for the CDC to ask for forms to be filled out at ports of entry by travelers during a pandemic is dangerous and frankly, idiotic. If a couple of more pieces of data are needed, then CBP should add that to their data collection, not create duplicative and wasteful paper collection requirements. TSA could provide screening of air passengers before they board aircraft, provided they are given real world practical tools to  do so.  E -mails are obviously not an efficient way to collect data in the 21st century.     I worked inside the beltway for about ten years, and the CDC should have a small headquarters staff there to fight the political battles, while leaving their scientist and technical experts in Atlanta."

It's called a starvation diet from years of those on the right assaulting government in general as inept and needing to be downsized. With measures such as ""sequestration""  a broad brush is applied and agencies such as the CDC are starved of the resources needed to maintain their capabilities to modernize and be on the cutting edge.  So here we are in the midst of a 100 year pandemic  and not the means to respond in a way that meets the needs."
2020-06-03 21:15:00,"I’ve been a scientist for 40 years, and the CDC was an organization I have looked to for guidance, evidence, and authority. Currently, I don’t feel I can depend upon the CDC for any of those things. In placing blame, I certainly include Trump and his administration’s disdain for facts and science, as well as Redfield. At the same time, I blame those at CDC as well. Look at the issues described in this article: poor communication, outdated technology, lack of coordination. Every one of those topics has come up in discussion about reduced funding for public health for the last 15 years. Add in the pandemic: I have been using pandemic and bioterror scenarios as teaching tools in undergraduate classes for 15 years. Consider quality issues: my Medical Laboratory Science students would never have released a test with contaminated reagents. So none of this is new or even particularly sophisticated subject matter, but apparently not enough people at CDC had the knowledge or the temerity to speak up and fix the problems. Don’t bother to tell me about the “excellent scientists” there. Scientific research can happen at any university, but the CDC’s mission states, “As the nation's health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats”, and that requires doing more than just research. Between this evidence of epic failure, and the abysmal Trump administration, I am not confident about our future."

Just about everything possible.

The US systemic reluctance to pay for adequate preparedness. On every involved level from locally elected coroners, over antiquated registration and reporting systems, to a financially starved CDC. The price of Reaganomics came late, but at extreme costs.

Trump was/is the wrong individual at the wrong time in the wrong place to handle any serious government issue. Amply demonstrated by his public denial of the the threat and later fantasies of miracle medicine and cures.

CDC arrogance meant denial of international cooperation and fast implementation of functioning test systems developed abroad. 

It is not difficult to register deaths, and with a functioning test system not difficult to register corona related deaths. But when the US taxpayers do not want to pay for competent independent pathologists but rely on elected ""coroners"" with no medical education whatsoever you are lost at the first step of registration. When reporting is politicized it's even worse.

Most modern nations have online systems for fast and accurate reporting, supplemented with relevant statistics for excess deaths, regardless of causes. In the US you do not even know how many died when and where, let alone from the virus or other causes, until many months later when such information is useless to counter a pandemic spread. 

Sorry, but the US inadequacy in this pandemic left your international partners baffled by your systemic incompetence."

     9/11: The day the NORAD stood down. 

And, nearly 19 years later, families of that hideousl day still asking ... how & why were we -- our gov't, our officials -- so unprepared, slow or simply unwilling  to act against a threat that was so clearly and repeatedly telegraphed and just as clearly, heading our way?

So, too, will it go with our stumbling, bumbling and uneven response to CoVid-19, along with the the bizarre 'reopening' variances across cities, counties and states. 

My husband just had to one of those (now nearly 'normal') 'take your life in your hands' experiences -- going to the pharmacy to pick up some medication that could not be preordered or shipped -- and was surprised to find not even the pharmacy staff uniformly wearing masks or wearing them properly. 
I mean, really. 

The echoes of the missteps of people in power with the capacity to act early and aggressively against this pandemic will echo across many years and several generations, just as 9/11 still does.

Very few of the failures described here are new. Theyve been failing for 30 years on Lyme Disease.  I lost all respect for the CDC when I developed severe neurologic Lyme. 

I learned that the CDC developed deeply flawed tests, blocks new and better tests that can expose their own testing failures, refuses to acknowledge extensive evidence that Lyme survives antibiotics, blocks research into chronic Lyme, endorses the disastrous dogma from the IDSA, slanders labs and doctors who dare to point out their failures and lies, and to top it all, they live on a pedestal with the widespread belief that they are the experts who use the best science and put public health as their top priority. 

I really thought their failures in handling Ebola would bring out new scrutiny and drastic change. Ebola was like a warmup for COVID 19  as far as epidemiology and pandemic control, but they didnt seem to learn anything. 

No thanks to the NYT for helping to enable them in this dysfunction and fraud while you give them free publicity for their manipulated studies, slander against their critics, and dismissal of patients whose lives have been ruined by Lyme.

2020-06-03 22:42:01,"Great overview and extensive journalism...keep up the good work!

I've made this comment in another article but will repeat it since it explains how executives' behavior and Trump discouraged test development. Executives are keenly aware of their bosses' opinions and attitudes -- they have to be since being a team player and supporting your boss is the number one job requirement -- more important than actual results. When CDC fumbled their test development, an executive should have stepped in to ramp up the urgency: bring the best minds to bear, drop other projects, do everything overnight if not sooner, reach out to partners to ensure their participation, daily updates, tiger teams, etc. But doing so would directly conflict with the attitude at the top. What exec is going to stick his/her neck out like that? So they continued fumbling while Trump continued fiddling...and continues today!"

2020-06-03 22:34:39,"My hospital is hiding lack of consistent, cohesive approach to pandemic under CDC guidelines.We started reusing N95 respirators and only one/day/person is issued for operating room personnel. Supposedly this is compliant with CDC guidelines, even so it is inconsistent with scientific consensus and politically independent expert opinions. Recovery room and pre-operative personnel is wearing cloth masks and “home” scrubs, despite studies indicating that healthcare workers should not wear cloth masks while taking care of patients. Again CDC weeks ago issued statement that cloth masks are acceptable if no surgical masks are available.
Problem is that now we are performing lots of so called elective procedures and in my point of view there is no justification to expose healthcare workers to potentially debilitating or even deadly infection , just to increase hospital income.
I see that money  drives our approach to healthcare, not really concern about patients or healthcare workers.

It is a tragedy how corrupt political ambitions interfered with this search for the truth and the mission to help people. 

The circumstances exploited tragic flaws, but we must realize that we are all in this together.  So, we acknowledge our shortcomings and we work harder, together, to help each other for the next round that we know is coming for all of us. 

It's not supposed to be easy.  But, we pick each other up, dust ourselves off, and get back to doing what we know is right.  

The brilliance of the CDC is the right tool for the job at hand. We need to let the scientific process work and evaluate what works and what didn't work. We don't stand a chance without that."

One fair observation is that recent outbreaks of H1N1, SARS and MERS, and Ebola were all relatively easily contained. Like any organization, it's all too easy to get complacent and become slightly arrogant from success.

Having said the above, ultimately, organizations like CDC can only effectively advise a president and an administration that's willing to listen. Trump's only interest in CDC was to use it as a prop to spin his lies and ignorance with deadly results. At that crucial moment, Dr. Roberet Redfield owed it to the mission of CDC, his colleagues, and the American public to resign in protest. Instead, Dr. Redfield nodded his head as Trump spouted one lie after another, telling the country that anyone can get a test and that he had innate ability to understand ""all this stuff. Dr. Redfield's acquiescence and silence will go down in history as an abject failure of professional responsibility. At the age of 68, after a long career, if you can't conjure up the courage to confront rank incompetence that can potentially kill millions of Americans, you are derelict in duty."

I have yet to see a single investigative report seeking accountability for this inexplicable  and illogical policy if the intent was to detect and then contain the virus. Where is the follow up on Crimson Contagion, and the classified briefings in a secure room at HHS where most from the CDC/HHS weren't allowed to attend? Why is this not followed up on by investigative reporting?"
2020-06-03 23:12:37,"Sadly public health policies are not all about only science. Implementing policies cost money and thus economics and the related underlying political ideologies come into play. We have certainly seen this come into play with the Trump Administration silencing the CDC. However, a portion of the blame, lies with hospital systems and hospital administrators and their failure to spend money to prepare for an airborne pandemic. NPR reported that, after the swine flu experience, the Obama Administration was in the process of putting legislation together requiring hospitals to be prepared for an airborne pandemic. The reason for this was because CDC issues guidelines that are voluntary, and not laws requiring what hospitals should be doing. As a result many hospitals chose not to implement the guidelines. When the Trump Administration took over, work on the proposed legislation was stopped.

They are to be commended for their bravery and ingenuity. But, perhaps the feeling that ""we don't need no stinkin' badges"" is what allowed the freshman mistake of contaminating PCR reagents for testing. For want of a nail (and a litany of other failures, poor appointments and micromanagement by an idiot president), the battle was lost. Between the president and CDC, we are on our own."
2020-06-03 23:20:13,"How did the CDC go wrong? Let’s omit politics, if we can.

Since 1932, this country has always elected Presidents with experience as (a) elected officials—typically governors, Senators, Congresspeople, or (b) the military—a general. Each of these people had well-examined careers in public service and other public organizations. In most cases, these previous experiences allowed the country to know their successes, their foibles—even their failures.  But in 2016, we slipped up. 

Michael Lewis’s 2018 book explains how administration and expertise are the “The Fifth Risk”. Beginning with the transition, Trump set the stage for the opposite—irresponsible incompetence. The book does not examine the CDC; instead, it examines several other departments and agencies. 

The CDC will rise again— everyone in Washington will prioritize it. But what of the other agencies Trump allowed to degenerate, as Lewis described? The Agriculture Dept., NOAA, and the rest. Do we have the resolve, the resources, the faith?

We start with the next election. Instead of politics, talk about competence, experience, policy. In words of one syllable: Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice, shame on us."

2020-06-03 23:14:57,"What seems to have happened with this pandemic is that the advice from the medical scientists was so drastic, that it raised the question of whether it was going to be politically possible to implement that advice.  What was needed was to bring in social scientists to counter the advice of the medical scientists, to try and determine what was going to be the best approach - given the economic misery that was going to be inflicted on millions by following the medical advice.  The social scientists needed to step up, and give some advice as to whether in their view - as Trump put it - the ""cure"" was going to be worse than the ""disease"".   But to my knowledge, no social scientists were ever consulted as to the human costs of following the medical advice - ie shutting down the economy."

2. Trump administration left 700 positions there unfilled at CDC. Trump killed off Obama's coordinating group at National Security Council that would have, for instance, flagged bureaucratic snags between FDA and CDC that blocked testing for weeks, for zero good reason. 

3. CDC has playbook that includes experts, not politicians as key public face in any emergency. Playbook emphasizes need for consistency and calm advice. Trump and most governors ignored all of that. 

4. There is political consensus that data is dangerous. Right wing realizes data leads to facts and fact-based policy. Left wing worries about privacy. Yeah, right wing does most of the damage. But it is not alone."

The above is simply outrageous! How can an agency like the CDC operate without state-of-the-art technology. Their purpose is kind of important, no?"
2020-06-04 00:33:17,"Medical professionals may be disappointed in the lack of guidance from the CDC, but if I were a press officer for the agency, I might keep my mouth shut too. Trump has deliberately cultivated a culture of fear and has repeatedly shot the messenger whenever the message doesn't mesh with his own magical reality. Anyone at the CDC who releases actual guidance runs the risk of being singled out as an ""Obama person"" pariah, abused on Twitter by the demagogue in chief, demonized by right-wing media, then summarily fired."
2020-06-04 00:37:55,"You mean to tell me that the former Army doctor who was put on trial for touting an effective AIDS vaccine in the 90's, appointed by a guy who played a fake boss on television after selling Pizza Hut pizza's because he bankrupted his own casino, doesn't know what to do during a pandemic!?

The heartbreaking end of the CDC as we used to know it is the direct result of what Michael Lewis described in The Fifth Risk.  When you demonize all things government you effectively throw the baby out with the bath water.  The consequence is that the very things you need government to do will not function properly.

The other analogy about the consequences of Trumpism is flying a plane.  Half the passengers elected a man with no experience to fly the plane.

2020-06-04 01:25:14,"As a lifelong admirer of the CDC, it's hard for me to judge, but I do think criticism is warranted on the grounds laid out here. That said, I can't count the number of articles I've read over the years in which the CDC  warned that a pandemic was inevitable and that it needed our help to prepare. This *should have been* a national priority but was not.

Too often we overthink and underact. You do not get a more urgent wake-up call then patient zero building a hospital in ten days. What part of ""this is deadly"" did so many miss? It's not as if we had to guess or estimate; we knew exactly how deadly it was in January. We *chose* not to  act on what Othello called the ""ocular proof.""

I feel for the CDC; by doing its job well, it literally can't win. If it warns of a pandemic and takes costly and challenging steps to prevent the worst outcome, (see MERS, SARS, and Ebola for cases in point) it's accused of being alarmist and when the worst is forestalled people say, ""See; we told you it wasn't bad!"" It may be because of the backlash in the wake of SARS, that they chose a more cautious route here, one that ended up costing thousands of lives. 

We must elect capable leaders, fund the CDC and WHO, and believe the visceral evidence (that hospital!). Preventing pandemics should become a more urgent issue than preparing for war; we're being decimated precisely because we were so busy creating enemies that weren't there at the cost of ignoring the enemy within.

2020-06-04 03:17:46,"As a former senior CDC official, I am confident in the career people at CDC.  They are the best, but this administration has crippled the CDC.  First, the Trump administration apparently eliminated the CDC offices in Beijing - the very group that kept CDC (and WHO) informed of the fast moving developments in China, and maintained critical working relationships that were effective across administrations.  This group of experts working for the US CDC based in Beijing played a key role in H1N1, SARS-1 and other major epidemics.  Second, the Trump administration eliminated the pandemic preparedness group in the National Security Council (NSC), and the NSC connections with CDC officials.  Third, the Trump administration has destroyed much of the previously effective communication and connection between career diplomats and CDC global health leaders.  Finally, Redfield is a good physician and lab scientist, but he is not a seasoned epidemiologist.  Prior effective CDC leaders have been former members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) and experienced epidemiologist; we are suffering because of ineffective leadership at the top of CDC.

With appropriate funding, an effective epidemiologist as leader of the CDC, an administration that allows the CDC to lead pandemic responses and not bow to ignorant politicians, restoration of the NSC pandemic group and healing the diplomatic core at State, the CDC should emerge again as the effective lead in the next pandemic."

He hates it when a production team produces an opera as the composer and librettist intended. He loves bizzare productions, the kind that have ruined opera for many people. It is one of the reasons that opera is losing audiences. Regietheater productions have not built new, young audiences. They have driven away many opera lovers. AT and many music critics are responsible for how opera is struggling. They champion perverse productions that many do not want to see and pan productions that follow what the composer wrote.
