2020-07-27 16:51:11,"As medical technologies, including AI, become more IT oriented, and global as well via cloud-based systems, the possibilities for quackery become not only more sophisticated, and prevalent, but  much more sinister as well.

2020-07-27 17:03:33,"As a physician, the most unsettling thing I encountered in training was the unreliable narrator of events, both personal and professional. In a profession that requires absolute honesty and accuracy, those who breach this fundamental requirement for their own aggrandizement or professional gain are often recognized as having sociopathic tendencies given the vulnerable and utterly dependent patients they are privileged to serve. This physician has all the hallmarks that go beyond merely being self serving, suggesting a more pathological and ominous personality disorder. To think he has gone unchallenged for years by his peers and has been allowed to freely contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge is equally shocking."
2020-07-27 17:11:22,"Can this guy be criminally charged, please? The organizations that let him proceed through the ranks need to have an independent review of their processes to identify what mistakes were made and by whom.

Perhaps most importantly: scientific journals shouldn't publish articles without access to the underlying data. It should be a condition of submission, especially where public health is concerned."
2020-07-27 17:14:40,"Although Dr. Desai has legitimate credentials, there are similarities between him and Surgisphere, and Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. The key is  the refusal to open his supposed database to review by others. That's a huge red flag. Science and medicine require review and validation by other experts. Secrecy is suspicious.

Also, Dr. Desai should have his medical license revoked based on the malpractice suits and his questionable behavior throughout his professional life."
2020-07-27 17:14:55,"This reminds me of the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"", based on the life of Frank Abagnale.  Once certain people are convinced/conned, the resume builds enough to use it to perpetrate the scheme further.  Once someone like this gets a taste for getting away with the masquerade, they start to feel invincible.  Yet it seems there were plenty of people along the way who saw something and tried to speak up.  We need to figure out what substantive knowledge looks like (hint: less hype and 'look at how great I am!"" personalities...)"

2020-07-27 17:09:22,"To varying degrees, these people exist throughout academic medicine and especially the private sector.

Resident: ""No significant changes this morning.""

Attending: ""Really? Nothing at all?""

Resident: ""Nope. Pretty much the same.""

Attending: ""That's strange; Mr. Smith died last night.""

2020-07-27 17:25:02,The Donald Trump of medicine.  Just what we need when belief in science is belittled by trumpery.  A great disservice to all and a breach of the Hippocratic Oath.
2020-07-27 17:34:33,"I worked in big pharma and in surgical device sales for twenty years.  There are many dedicated ethical doctors out there, unfortunately, I would hazard to guess at least twenty to thirty percent of physicians (especially specialists) are money motivated period.  Our corporate lingo for these people was ""entrepreneurial"" physicians.  What management meant was these guys would take money under any circumstances and try to bypass ethical guidelines.  Of course, I was part of the problem too, and eventually, I got out of the medical industry altogether for my own sanity.  I had customers who were surgical specialists who made two to five million a year, doing dozens (yes dozens) of procedures a day (many with poor outcomes).  Medicine is all about money, insurance companies, medical groups, and the guild that limits the number of doctors in medical school every year.  It's all part of a giant money-making juggernaut.  This guy is but a symptom."
2020-07-27 18:32:22,"Might be worthwhile for the patients suing this physician for malpractice to add the deep pockets of those programs , Duke, etc to the list. Someone has to hold programs accountable for allowing these con men to graduate without the skills and the honor to practice medicine"
2020-07-27 18:35:30,"There are con artists in every field. The timing of the Desai news couldn't be worse, when we desperately need scientific and medical advice we can trust.

Cutting corners on research related to a pandemic is beyond the pale. It does make me wonder whether Desai knew his research wasn't adequately supported, or whether this is a case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. That is, he regularly overestimates his abilities and knowledge."
2020-07-27 17:56:15,"I don't take issue with anything in this article.  However, I can testify that Dr. Desai is brilliant.  That's why this is all so sad.  Last year, I had a sudden crisis my left leg.  A cardiologist misdiagnosed the problem.  Dr. Desai immediately saw the error, correctly diagnosed the problem (I had a fairly rare condition, which many doctors had not even heard of), scheduled an emergency angiogram and saved my  leg.  For that I'll always be grateful."

There is no way hospitals could easily input anonymized patient data from disparate EHRs and translate into a single homogenized registry. Impossible.  And he has maybe a dozen employees?

2020-07-27 18:27:51,"Thanks NY Times for doing the investigating of this charlatan super-star doctor.  Red flags going up along the way during this guy's whole career.  He will probably lay low for awhile and move on to another unsuspecting medical facility or most likely sell his flashy data collection company to a Private Equity firm.  Doesn't say much about  American standards anymore or checks and balances in the system.  Everyone is in a hurry to get to the big pay day.  Isn't that what the medical profession/big pharma/technology/big data/wall street has become?  Let's get there fast at all costs.  Big money, big egos."
2020-07-27 17:26:40,"As a former federal fraud prosecutor:  There are many indications that the subject of this article is a fraudster who has a multi-year pattern of fabricating and distorting information to his own benefit.  I’d bet pennies to dollars that he inflated the anonymous patient numbers in the studies that have now been retracted (inferentially to boost the profile - and concomitantly the value - of his own company).
The FBI and USAO should be investigating this character for wire fraud.
 Thus article is also a deep indictment of the medical profession.  Shame on Duke for promoting him when he was in their program."
2020-07-27 17:47:13,"One need not go much further than this: 

""Dr. Desai, who declined to share the raw information even with his co-authors, claimed it was culled from a massive trove acquired by Surgisphere, a business he started during his residency.""

These people have more of an interest in filthy lucre than they have in patients."
2020-07-27 17:38:19,I is unfortunate that bad apples like Dr. Desai have contributed to the corruption that has seeped in. No doubt a more robust screening process needs to exist to weed out those who choose personal gain over community at large

Perhaps one helpful step would be to stop the cultlike glorification of the early graduation super students."
2020-07-27 18:10:18,"I appreciate that the NYT is writing about this person in a critical way. But I don't understand why Gabler & Rabin pull their punches here. ""Cutting corners"" and ""misrepresenting information"" does not accurately describe the criticisms of the Surgisphere 'data'. Scare quotes are required in this case because knowledgeable critics made a very good case for concluding that there are no data from Surgisphere on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19. In other words, there are good reasons to think that Desai made it all up out of thin air. Why does the article not directly address that criticism? It is directly relevant to the point that the Surgisphere papers and their retractions damaged public trust in medical science -- that trust and the medical literature is always susceptible to outright fraud, and it is not the fault of the medical establishment or the journals that they may have been deceived by a fraudulent study. That is not ""cutting corners"", and it should not be mislabelled in such a way."
2020-07-27 18:12:50,"So many, many red flags. Where are the medical boards in the state(s) in which he is licensed? And where is the hospital oversight?"
2020-07-27 18:17:45,"Scientific research in general has a problem with cheaters. In higher education, you *must* publish research studies, or you loose your job. Research journals push to publish studies that show an effect. This is problematic as knowing what doesn't work can be as important as knowing what does work. The whole model needs to be adjusted, and those who lie should have their degrees revoked."
2020-07-27 17:41:35,"Any researcher or scientist who knows in advance the results of his study, and orders his inquiries to present data conforming to this predetermined outcome, is committing the logical fallacy of circular reasoning, as well as fraud, which is an effort to deceive colleagues and others.  

Even if the offending researcher has advanced degrees and high professional status, the work he is doing can not be called science and would be better understood as social pandering or the self-aggrandizing manipulation of scientific protocols, which always demand open minded investigations of the empirical world.  

Without a faithful adherence to the norms of honesty, the objective questioning of data, and a belief in the integrity of the scientific method there would be no possibility of developing a scientific knowledge.  And without objective and ethically grounded research, there would be an irredeemable loss to the authority of medicine and a devaluation of the scientific value of work done in any discipline that studies the natural world."
2020-07-27 17:49:17,"This guy, albeit very very intelligent, is a hustler. He has no Hippocratic morals and patients are inconsequential to him.  What a danger for patients! Where are the medical boards? Many doctors are wonderful, empathetic professionals. I know because I have worked beside them. But, this man, named in malpractice lawsuits, should have his medical license revoked. Patients beware!"
2020-07-27 18:00:16,"It's amazing that this guy does a ""study"" to torpedo Trump's claims on hydroxychloroquine and the press ran with it, unquestioningly.   Making Trump look bad was more important than examining the study closely."

Make no mistake, this is the top of the iceberg as far as corruption and incompetence in the medical industrial complex.

2020-07-27 18:36:50,"If you've heard of Elizabeth Holmes and her faux blood testing company, Theranos,  that lured in wealthy, well known government officials, to become investors then this story of Dr. Desai will sound familiar.  Read ""Bad Blood,""  the recent non-fiction book for a fascinating trip through the old tale of con-men and women and greedy investors.  My bet:  Dr. Desai's shady history as a medical wunderkind will leave investors broke and him in disgrace, awaiting a trial for fraud just like Ms. Holmes.  And keep in mind Donald Trump was a major proponent of  the useless treatment for covid 19 that Desai has been hawking."
2020-07-27 18:39:11,It is disheartening but it is not an unfamiliar tale in medicine. I am dismayed repeatedly to learn how such a person gets through a rather long and tortuous educational process. It takes a minimum of grueling 6 years of scrutiny and training after college and medical school to become a vascular surgeon. (Generally 14 adult years in one’s prime). All those interviewed who may have kept quiet or all who may have let him pass to the next stage are guilty of the oath “do no harm”
2020-07-27 17:41:11,"My question is why does it require shadowy private databases to do these studies? Where are countries with actual health care systems like Italy, UK, Spain, and France? Shouldn't they have enough data to give some decent answers to some of these questions?"
2020-07-27 17:53:04,"Really bright-seeming, confident young professionals can bring with them an element of intellectual intimidation that is hard to push back against.  Graduated college at 19? Got his MD at 27?  MBA?  Supposed JD?  In this world of overachievers in science and business, everyone tends to be impressed by the wunderkind.

I had a general practitioner here in Daytona Beach, now in his late 30s, who reminds me of this Desai.  Owned his own practice complete with a nurse practitioner and several staff assistants while at the same time being a registered hospitalist at the local public hospital.  He also simultaneously invested in an urgent care clinic run by a physician's assistant, which is where I first heard about him.

His staff couldn't stop talking about how capable and smart he was.  I wound up employing his services.  At our first meeting he was almost gushy and self-involved, on the verge of being inappropriate.  I assumed he was out to impress me.  At subsequent meetings he seemed distracted and more interested in telling me about his stress-induced diabetes and problems with his many business ventures than in my own health situation.

It didn't get better.  Eventually I fired him."
2020-07-27 17:57:37,"In working with teens as a volunteer there have been one or two over the years who did whatever they did only for the credit, not for the love of the activity or for the learning.  It is always frustrating."
2020-07-27 18:01:51,"And this is why he is not in academic medicine --- not just the inability to get along with others, the lack of clinical acumen, the impatience (and desire to cut corners), but what appears to be falsification of data or using biased / incomplete data to get the results that put him on the map (and subsequently obliterated off of it). I would like to be a fly on the wall (and in that database) to know what is really going on."
2020-07-27 18:08:31,"His co-authors are complicit in writing these papers. How could they agree to author papers without seeing any of the raw data? 
It is interesting if they ever inquired to see the raw data and who has written the papers that were retracted. Dr. Desai is most likely a scientific charlatan who either entirely fabricated the data or had a very small statistical sample of data and presented it as a very large sample. Medical journals should require submitting raw data with their sources as a guarantee of the authenticity of the data."
2020-07-27 18:22:38,"How did Desai keep moving up, even as he raised alarms? I think I found the explanation: “You didn’t want him to bring you down with him,” said one of his ex-colleagues. No care there for the patients he might “bring down.” Just the careers of those he worked with, the reputation of the medical facilities and medical schools. 

This practice of protecting physicians and surgeons, quietly moving them on, is widespread. It’s dangerous. It’s cynically disrespectful toward patients. Physicians’ disciplinary and court records are largely hidden from patient scrutiny. One surgeon who worked for a local medical group was quietly moved on (he sent out the usual letter saying he was pursuing opportunities elsewhere, and he did go to a medical practice in another state). When he was later charged with several hideous crimes involving children, it came out that several of his ex-colleagues here had reported concerns about his behavior at work, and that is why he was let go. That surgeon had treated me right before he left. I was referred to him by a colleague of his.  I had no idea he was working under a cloud. Did the doc who referred me know? 

When patients are researching a physician’s credentials, two red flags to look for is changing jobs too often, and moving down to a less prestigious position or to a lesser hospital."
2020-07-27 18:24:27,"""...had cast himself as an ambitious physician, an entrepreneur with an M.B.A. and a prolific researcher published in medical journals"".

2020-07-27 18:25:42,"Healthcare has become a profit making enterprise. That is why we see emphasis on revenue generation rather than patient care. 

Dr. Desai did not suddenly emerge from an unknown land but was associated with many prestigious medical hospitals in this country, yet was undetected or tolerated for a long time about his unethical practices by those institutions. 
Entrepreneurial doctors should be kept out of medical field. 

Healthcare and money making does not mix well. Dr. Desai  should be investigated and ousted from this noble field if found guilty."
2020-07-27 18:12:29,"Frauds like this need to be sussed out early in their careers, or even better, before their professional careers even begin.

I had an undergraduate student last semester who, by all accounts, had impressed previous faculty members with her brilliance. When she turned in the first draft of her senior thesis I took one look at it and new immediately that it was not her own work. The student's confidence and self-assured personality appeared to have made other teachers drop their guard when they should have been suspicious.

I get the sense that Dr. Desai had employed similar tactics when submitting work to colleagues. In academia, as in other walks of life, a healthy dose of skepticism can serve to avoid being duped by individuals whose intents are less than honest."
2020-07-27 18:20:24,"If I ran a scientific journal and someone told me they couldn’t share data because of a confidentiality agreement, the first thing I would do is demand to see the agreements, then I would contact the other parties on these agreements (if the agreements even existed, and that is a big if) to discuss the nature of the data. That is the MINIMUM any journal should do. Did these journals even confirm if these confidentiality agreements exist, or if the “agreements” were just invented to cover up for falsified data? Reminds me of a guy who once said he couldn’t release his tax returns because he was being audited."
2020-07-27 18:37:31,"As an Indian-American physician, I'm appalled by Desai's behavior for multiple reasons:
 
1. At a critical phase in our fight against Covid-19, this man did considerable harm to public health by muddying evidence on how best to treat this deadly disease. Expensive & logistically complex trials were halted worldwide, leading to delays in producing evidence that could guide physicians’ decision-making.

2. This episode has further eroded the public's trust in medical research, which is the last thing we need in the era of conspiracy theories & anti-science politicking. When our media keeps announcing dramatic new scientific findings but then backtracking shortly thereafter, this psychological whiplash effect eventually causes the public to stop listening.

3. On a personal level, I’m horrified by Desai’s behavior because the fallout may end up unfairly hurting the reputations of countless honest, thoughtful, & ethically minded Indian-American physicians. Most minorities feel personally responsible for representing their group’s moral values, capabilities, & “worthiness” of belonging in America at all times. The burden is heavy. Now more than ever, our sense of belonging is under threat. Episodes like this help legitimize the casual racism, snap judgments, & negative stereotyping that physicians of color continually face.

Desai may not represent me or my values – because (surprise) I’m a completely different person –  but I’m afraid that nuance is not our country’s strong suit."
2020-07-27 17:37:45,"The world of lies we live in has to be disturbing to any sane person, just at a practical level. Of course, with a president such as the one we have who commands center-stage the way he does, plus approaching life, as has become common, as a zero-sum game, lies have become evermore part of and tolerated as the American way. (Consider the history of the field of advertising, the practice of international diplomacy, etc, for example.) It’s unfortunate and probably a loss to the greater good that Dr Desai chose the way he apparently did to “make it;” he seems to be a bright enough guy to have achieved well otherwise. But I suspect there are many more like him. Doing science and practicing medicine surely ought to be in the category of the “sacred” because these serve so often the vulnerable in need for their very lives. That’s what’s so immoral about the situation ... the disregard of life. Unfortunately it’s just too often not that way these days. The question is, How in these fields, if not generally, is the truth in America going to matter again ... or maybe for the first time?"

2020-07-27 18:42:49,"“In interviews, more than a dozen doctors who worked with him during training and residency said they had often found him to be an unreliable physician, who seemed less interested in patient care than in the medical journal he founded and his company…Several former colleagues said that often he did not follow through on directives about treating patients, and that when he was questioned about it, he sometimes passed blame or offered implausible explanations.” Seems like Dr. Desai and Trump are dinosaurs of a feather.

On another note: “…Dr. Desai’s co-authors [in the New England Journal of Medicine study], conceding they had never seen the raw data, called for an independent review…” I’m not familiar with NEJM or other professional publications, so maybe it’s normal that co-authors don’t see raw data, but that sure as heck bothers me."

Then it’s all I can do to detach myself from having anything to do with them. How is it that someone like in him could have risen so far for so long without being shut down? I’m afraid this says more about our healthcare system than it does about the bad doctor."
2020-07-27 18:49:09,"Whatever you think about Dr. Desai's attributes, honesty does not seem to be one of them. remember the harm done by a Dr. Wakefield, a british physician who falsely claimed that vaccines were linked to autism? However absurd, it had adverse consequences. Accordingly, uncovering Desai's untrue assertions is the prudent thing to do. You wonder how many others out there, for self-glory or greed, are intent in doing likewise. How Trumpian can we humans get when we think no one is watching? Scary indeed."
2020-07-27 18:49:09,"I've worked with Ph.D.'s that acted similarly and advanced on credentials gained from work that wasn't fully their own, although they gladly took credit for it. Their claims were attention-getting, but colleagues eventually learned not to trust them. Their contributions were much less than the problems they created and worsened when someone gave them a microphone and mistaken credibility. The fertile fields of newcomers eager to believe them helped promote their image, but did nothing to make them more reliable and credible. The old adage remains: Buyer Beware."
2020-07-27 18:49:42,"The first and biggest red flag was ""you can't see my data.""   His co-authors, who lent their prestigious names,  to his paper are to blame.  Privacy is not a excuse for one or all of them failing to double-check the validity of the data.  Also to blame are the medical journal and the media who grasped the paper's revelations so eagerly, giving the appearance (if not fact) that they cared more about politics than science."
2020-07-27 18:51:24,"The worst aspect of such stories and cases is that so few doctors and others in medical community will ever make an issue or see anything done ,besides keeping such data within the ""white coated walls of silence"",
 akin to the blue-wall of silence among the police.  The idea originally being that medicine was not even a science once-but a kind of apprenticeship-and that making denigrating comments about young doctors might impede their future growth. Today such reasoning has little relavance.
    Now, far too much crooked and sloppy behavior gets swept under the  piles of medical waste and dirty sheets headed for the red bag.
    By a certain point, probably almost every doctor has outstanding ""debts"" owed all over the medical community, for incidents and accidents covered up and ignored--the last people to hear about them are the patients."

This has appeared incorrectly before in a Times article. Your journalists should know that an ""antidote"" is a drug or substance that counteracts the effects of a poison. Hydroxychloroquine is not an ""antidote"" to the coronavirus; it should be referred to as a treatment (effective or not). If trump used the word ""antidote"" in his ramblings, then the journalist should use quotes around the word when referring to something he said."

So shouldnt the NYT issue an apology to President Trump - who relied on strong data in the French study, other studies, and clinical experiences of many physicians who had success treating their covid patients - as the NYT claimed multiple times that Trump’s claims were false?  Science fraudsters like the Dr featured here are exposed eventually over time.  But the damage done by mainstream news in trying to “fact check” Trump on this issue and by propagating fake science is incalculable in terms of lives lost and confidence in non-patentable affordable therapeutics."
2020-07-27 18:54:24,"this is one example of why looking for quick answers to scientific problems like this terrifying disease leads to disastrous mistakes and poor judgments. Not only were the results claimed not properly vetted by questioning the data base but the conman doctor -so like trump- was not vetted. Now, although there are many valid reasons to dismiss using hydrochloraquine to treat the novel corona virus charlatans like the snake oil salesman in the white house can point to this con artist as justification for his own bunko support for it. And while they are silent on this guy they attack the careful considered and scientifically proper evolved set of responses of the only scientific grownup in the room.

2020-07-27 17:20:52,"The responsible thing for NYT to do is mention that a leading epidemiologist at Harvard has emphatically endorsed use of hydroxychloroquin in new COVID infections very recently. As have several other experts. It is disappointing that I have to monitor Fox News to follow the news these days. Also irritating is the ongoing false claims by news outlets that HCQ is dangerous when even the studies finding it ineffective also found it not harmful. Only one study found it harmful and that was VA’s retrospective where severely ill and old, high risk patients were given it as a last resort. I have taken it daily for 16 years, with dozens of zpaks over those years, with no adverse reactions. it is sold over the counter in Africa for malaria. It is time for the press to stop relying on bald assertions of danger from doctors who aren’t even prescribing it. Ask a rheumatologist or a front line COVID doctor, not sanjay gupta.  It may help for mild cases, to prevent them from becoming hospital cases."

Well, yes, the experts are human and the ""scientific method"" is used by humans to serve their purposes, agendas, greed and so on.  What is really a shame is that the other word we need to genuflect to, the ""press,"" is also exploited by humans in support of their agendas,  beliefs, prejudices and so on and is becoming not only useless, because we can't count on its objectivity, but is used by yes, politicians to manipulate the public.  Of course we know its really the Russians and Chinese undermining our democracy, corporations and culture - not our media, politicians and political system, corporations or greed.  I'm sure Desai came from a Chinese or Russian re-education camp intent on messing with our Exceptional response to COVID.  Maybe we should have re-education camps for those who have lost track of morality, or maybe judging from what no expert needs to tell us, maybe were to far gone.  Anyways, we can always start a war to give the economy boost and avoid dealing with the flaws in our system that have brought us to this low point - OH, I forgot, its the Russians and Chinese!"

Dr. Desai's efforts to get sales of Surgisphere's QuartzClinical, while not a con on the level of Theranos, have that same stink. Perhaps, his business acumen has most in common with the occupant of the WH.

Sad to see in the current environment of preliminary clinical study results being pushed out in Twitter-like ways, that arguably  the two most prestigious med journals in the world couldn't restrain themselves, but maximized speed and publicity."

2020-07-27 18:52:21,"Additional information about  Extract from wiki about Méchain.
Méchain was uncertain of the precision of his measurements to establish the meter length owing to anomalous results in verifying his latitude This small error of 2,290 meters equals 1.423 statute miles; the error in such a large measurement amounts to 14½ inches per statute mile. It represents in each meter an error of approximately 0.23 millimetre –  the width of a single strand of human hair. Known as ""Méchain's error"", with the suggestion that the tiny variation in the length of the meridian  can be attributed to Méchain's calculations. But analysis of Méchain's figures reveals that he consistently kept the discrepancy very tiny, essentially forcing his individual reported measurements to appear more precise and consistent than would be reasonably expected of a survey involving more than a hundred measurements of mostly rough country using 18th century equipment; 

Méchain's putative error did not affect the final value of the length of the meter nor the measurement of the meridian Showing that even a small error can grow into a large error over long distances. It would appear that Dr.rDesai has made small errors that have become larger over a longer time."
2020-07-27 18:52:42,"This man is clearly a fraud, and many commenters have remarked on the system that permitted him to continue to advance. But there are also disturbing questions about the review process at these top journals, and what could have possibly led the co-authors on these papers to feel comfortable with their names appearing on them despite all the red flags that were obvious in hindsight.

It is very difficult to design a publication process that is both timely and resilient to outright fraud on the part of authors. It really is a tall order, and in some sense this is a success story in that scientists subjected the publications to adequate scrutiny after they were actually released. But much damage had already been done given media accounts of the papers and intense (and unfortunately politicized) interest in the topic. I hope to see a post-mortem on the review process to identify ways to improve the current scientific publication system."
2020-07-27 18:55:36,"Enablers all along the way lengthened the tortured road to Dr. Desai's inevitable downfall. We want to believe the best about people, especially hard-working overachievers, even those with no bedside manner, but too many in positions of power here disregarded alarm bells in favor of the status quo or prestige. The gatekeepers and decision-makers ultimately opted for the same blind expediency as Dr. Desai, and their reputations will suffer as a result."

2020-07-27 19:03:16,"So much for following the science.  This unfortunately seems to be happening with increasing frequency.

That medicine has been around for decades, and is taken like water in Africa to combat malaria. I didn’t believe these findings for a second. But because it disputed Trumps hope for the drug, the media just takes it and runs with it.  Typical."
2020-07-27 19:14:13,"There is a silver lining to this dark story; scientists corrected the error introduced by two prominent journals. I'm sure that other studies are underway regarding chloroquine and hydro-q that will illuminate their utility with covid-19, and those studies will receive the same scientific scrutiny.

Compare and contrast with the Trump method. The loudest and most outrageous voice wins in that system. I'm with the scientists every time, never with trump, his allies, or supporters."
2020-07-27 18:51:25,"The medical profession seems pretty lax in allowing Desai, as described here, to continue, but I imagine that he does as he wishes reflects a group unwilling to act on criticism on one of their own. Perhaps a worry that they too might be faulted sometime in the future."
2020-07-27 18:54:53,"Medicine, like many other fields dominated by communities of practice, rewards stars. If you just dutifully take care of your patients, steering them clear of procedures and drugs they don't need, you don't stand out enough to impress. You won't be selected by your peers for promotions. Diligence and honesty are pretty incomparable to research money and billing."
2020-07-27 19:01:32,"Many states have “fatality review” boards to investigate individual child deaths or domestic violence deaths in detail, to find the gaps in the systems where people fall through the cracks. They are not punitive in an official way, rather they reveal points of intervention to improve public safety and have led to changes in law and policy to protect the public. 

If there isn’t already, the medical field needs something similar. No need to review every case just exemplar cases like this one. Many ppl who work in the field recognize the dynamics that allowed Desai to go unchecked. 

Bring greater awareness to these, as this article does, so training programs, hospitals, academic journals etc can’t willfully ignore red flags."

Why is he still on the Harvard faculty and why is he still on staff at the Brigham? Why is he still editor-in-chief of an important journal?!

Dr Desai is really bad. Dr Mehra is more influential & worse. Do any other publications from Dr Mehra need to be withdrawn? Has anybody checked?

It is rampant, and one could make a case that cheating is part of the process fo socialization. 

In science and academia today there are numerous ways to cheat. Predatory journals - journals that charge professors to publish anything in their pages and do absolutely no peer review (although they claim to do) - are rife. Where do these journals originate?

2020-07-27 19:30:46,"From my perspective of working for the business and governance areas of global pharmaceutical corporations, I was very surprised when recently Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine published and quickly retracted two major studies about Covid 19 based on Dr. Desai’s healthcare analytics. These two studies were also under consideration by the World Health Organization. 

In the areas of drug development, the role of pharmacovigilance and healthcare analytics are very important in terms of proving the efficacy of the drugs as well as reviewing and monitoring harmful side effects. It was very atypical that Dr. Desai refused to reveal the raw data associated with these clinical analytics related to the above two studies. 

Furthermore, Dr. Desai’s corporation, Surgisphere includes a science fiction writer and other employees of dubious credentials. These skill sets are very unusual for a corporation involved in highly important healthcare analytics about clinical trials involving drug development studies of such importance like Covid 19 

In view of Dr. Desai’s propensity to falsify data and credentials, he should be censured by the American Medical Association as soon as possible to prohibit him from engaging in such dangerous business practices to endanger human lives for profiteering."

Who suppress and manipulate data? When WHO says it's safe or Doctors Without Borders says it's safe or countries like Germany, New Zealand or Canada whom I trust far more than my own government state it's safe and effective only then will I get the vaccine.

What do we know about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and its safety and efficacy? At least the doctor raised the questions early on. Will time and more and better research prove the doctor right or not? If it turns out he was right, but only by some intuitive understanding, then we have a genius who made the mistake of falsifying data to prove what might be true. Yes, a bad thing but....those who took his advice might have benefited."

But, seriously, this raises an important point: any study that doesn't collect its own primary data stands and falls with the quality and completeness of the dataset analyzed. GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) applies especially with epidemiological studies.  Both researchers who use someone else's databases and the reviewers of any publication that results from such use are well-advised to verify the reputation and reliability of the source used.  It's just like when reporting news: who is your source, can the information be trusted, can it be independently verified, and, if not, what makes you certain the information is good?  Yes, that's extra work, but the reputational damage caused by not doing due diligence far exceeds the gain of being out of the gate first."
2020-07-27 19:38:00,"I was taking an ACE inhibitor blood pressure medicine. The paper published on the basis of data supplied by Dr. Desai said that this would increase likelihood of contracting and getting hospitalized due to the ACE2 being used by the novel Coronavirus to enter the lungs. After reading this paper, I talked to my GP and switched to a Calcium channel blocker drug. Later studies published contradicted the findings of Dr. Desai and others. In fact the studies found that the survival rate was higher for those taking ACE inhibitors due to the inflammation reducing effect of the drug. There must be serious consequences for fake data being used during a global pandemic. A person stealing a $5 item at Walmart goes to jail. The guilty must do serious time for this fake data and publication and causing serious harm to many.

Any time a physician feels the need to ""embellish"" his or her credentials, that's a kind way of calling them a liar.  If a physician lied about his/her credentials, how does one trust or believe any of their medical advise or assessments?

Colleagues apparently observed this disqualifying trait, alerted those who could do something about it, & everyone who might have stopped him failed to do so. He has done a great disservice to the medical profession, patients, trusting peers, & to the advancement of scientific study. And since some of his fellow countrymen have spoken out, he has additionally done potential damage to practitioners of color. His boundless ambition should be rewarded by the loss of his medical license."

It makes you wonder how many patients experienced worse outcomes because of Dr. Desai's inattention (and I'm not just referring to the malpractice suits that are pending.) Glad to hear that Surgisphere has been dismantled. Anonymized or not, patient data is already too vulnerable to hacking, theft and misuse. And with the rush to develop a covid19 vaccine, stories like this certainly don't give one much confidence that corners will not in fact be cut. That is why clinical trials and peer reviewed findings are so critical to the practice of medicine and the efficacy and safety of drugs.
Let's hope the FDA is on top of its game and not prone to being bullied by a corrupt Trump administration whose greatest interest in a vaccine is not really about saving lives, but about Trump's re-election."

2020-07-27 20:39:49,It should have been obvious to biomedical researchers that Desai “created” his database by making false assumptions on patients throughout the world. He then recruited his friend Mehra at Harvard to use his influence to get their results published in “prestigious “ medical journals where editors favor friendships over merit. Mehra should be fired and Desai should be prosecuted for all his wrongdoing.

2020-07-27 21:05:01,"Dr. Desai is clearly a fraud and charlatan. It's no wonder that people within the Trump Administration and Mr. Trump so quickly began to accept and believe the claims about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.  Then, as did Dr. Desai, the Trumpers quickly touted the claims as factual and the basis of the claims that hydroxychloroquine is beneficial.  
Mr. Trump is a bad liar and charlatan.  Dr. Desai fits right in with the Trump crowd.  
Hopefully Dr. Sais's medical credentials are soon revoked and he is barred from practicing medical research or anything else that jeopardizes the health of people everywhere. Certainly none of papers should ever be published again without stringent review by known, reputable and distinguished medical professionals.

His conclusions may be correct but the data should confirm this in his and future studies to believe it. Only in the Trump era is there such a rush to produce results --positive or negative--overnight. Vaccines typically take 12-18 months to produce a safe and effective vaccine. We should expect and plan for this probability rather than hope for quick results like Trump. We are still waiting for Covid 19 to magically disappear without doing anything like universal mask use. Eventually Trump will be right, it will go away but there may be 300,000 deaths before that happens if we don't mandate mask use."
2020-07-27 20:43:09,"As a physician I can only say, 'just appalling', on so many levels.   And I remain both incredulous and fearful that our culture sanctions confabulation."
2020-07-27 20:53:17,"Any super achiever or a company that claims a super product has to be subjected to a much closer scrutiny. The journals that published DR. Sapan Desai's papers and then retracted should have wondered why they were publishing his papers in a hurry. It is unfortunate that there is a huge audience for anything contrary or defamatory to what the presidents says. Most of us ignore what politicians have to say but to make up data to prove the president wrong is going over board. We all need to recognize that there are not just hot zone for Coronavirus COVID-19 spread but the whole topic and information on the virus coming out is red hot and not worth anything meaningful. 

Some of us who managed to stay away from getting infected are getting sick not from the virus but the panic and sensationalism that has taken over the world. If after 7 months of the pandemic there are people who simply refuse to do what it takes to contain the virus and are expecting miracles are bound to be disappointed."
2020-07-27 20:55:44,"What Dr. Desai did was inexcusable, at a crucial moment he reported fake scientific data. But I believe it is necessary to scrutinize on even harsher terms the medical journals where he published his fake research: Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine. Simply put: they should know better, a lot better. Now, the editors of these 2 journals will point fingers to the reviewers of these papers whom remain anonymous (as all reviewers do in all journals). Soon it will be forgotten and all will move on, except the damage to the public trust in Science. What are these journals doing to restore the public trust? Just the retractions and an apology are not enough."
2020-07-27 20:56:05,"I hope every mainstream scientific publication takes this to heart and stops allowing their political views to pollute science. That is what happened here. And the MSM’s fearmongering about a drug that has been safely used—and some might say dispensed as readily as candy, for 50 years also was clearly a result of their politics, not science. This mixing of feeling with fact is the most frightening development in the 21st century."
2020-07-27 20:57:53,Shameful of Desai to have peddled fake results to advance his own ambitions. He has all the hallmarks of someone that could fit in well in a senior medical position in the Trump administration and endorse a cure just in time before the election. Just need to be wary of such people.

2020-07-27 20:51:13,"Every once in a while you encounter a doctor or scientist who is willing to cut corners or overlook the inconvenient fact in their drive for what they believe must be true, or worse, what will make them famous. Very dangerous. As a scientist, it tells me how much we rely on the scrupulous honesty and accountability of everyone in the profession. We have to do better.

It looks like there were many ignored red flags in the career of Dr. Desai. But even had those not been there, it was incumbent on his co-authors in the hydroxychloroquine studies to insist on seeing the evidence - the raw data. This is particularly true in today's world in which big data reigns supreme - how do we trust it, unless we can examine how it was collected?"
2020-07-27 20:53:08,"The simple comment by Desai that integrating data from different hospitals is a simple process thanks to his efforts is a dead give-away of a trumpian approach  to truth and accountability.

2020-07-27 21:06:13,"It is too much to expect everyone in any given field to be trust-worthy. I am actually impressed by how quickly the medical research community caught the fraud. Yes, there is damage done to the reputation of scientific community in general and medical advice our publish health agencies provide for COVID in particular, but this is also an example for how effective is the self regulation of our community. For anyone who promote conspiracy theory in climate change research, this example shows how ridiculous it is to believe the entire scientific community in climate research could be fooled or conspire to create a false narrative of what is happening to our planet.  There will always be another Dr. Desai, as long as we continue to question each other's work critically, science will continue to be trusted by most of people, even when making decision for opening schools this fall."

2020-07-27 21:15:02,"Another problem plaguing academic medicine is the explosion of medical “mass publication”, especially involving doctors at some of the most prestigious institutions. When I search PubMed these days I am amazed to see the number of publications many, many doctors have, when even in their thirties or forties (ages are easy to track down). How can anyone have 200, 300 or even higher numbers of publications at the age of 45 (say) while doing clinical work? It is easy to crunch the numbers: some people are publishing (or more precisely, their names are appearing on) 2, 3, 4 (or even higher) articles per month. There is absolutely no way these authors are making a meaningful (or any) contribution to the articles on which their names appear. Even worse, think of the poor reviewers who are inundated with this volume of material to evaluate. It makes a mockery of scientific publication, and undoubtedly contributed to the two ridiculous articles published in the NEJM and The Lancet."

2020-07-27 21:20:15,"The headline should have stated data about hydroxychloroquine efficacy misinformation by a professional scientist.  Due to the politicization of HCQ, we really do not know whether it has efficacy.  Those that try to publish  that is has efficacy will be turned down during peer review and also have difficulty receiving grants.  This demonstrates there is no such thing as guided by the ""science"", since ""science"" is typically politicized."

First rule of academic publishing from my day: if you put your name to the paper you own it.  No ifs, ands or buts.  Occasionally a secondary author might include a note in the text that he or she was responsible only for Procedure X which was part of the whole and, in my view, this can be valid.  An author is claiming no credit for the overall work.  I see no such declarations at least in the NEJM paper.  The Lancet paper contains these words: 'MRM and ANP supervised the study. All authors approved the final manuscript and were responsible for the decision to submit for publication.""

I cannot imagine putting my name to a research paper without understanding the entire effort; or if that is not possible, without delineating clearly the portion to which I had contributed."
2020-07-27 21:15:53,"This kind of case is hardly a surprise. The case remains that selection and self-selection for medical school, and apparently for promotion within, does not require being a ""people person"" or even liking people, let alone being able to cooperate honestly with them."
2020-07-27 21:25:57,"Why does modern culture reward ruthless behaviors, where prioritizing one’s personal advancement over ethics is seen as a dazzling sign of character? As others suggest, this is modeled in our White House. As a graduate of prestigious engineering institution with extensive corporate tech experience, I have seen characters similar to Dr. Desai advance with the full endorsement of leaders and it always puzzles me how people seem surprised when the lies surface. Why didn’t these journals not take a harder line and absolutely insist on access to all of the data? It is abhorrent that his patients and the global population in a pandemic are the victims here. Another trend I have seen is that when women such as myself bravely raise their concerns about the dubious ethics of such colleagues, these concerns are often not taken seriously. I have been dismissed for doubting the brilliance of a wunderkind who was later shown to be violating my company’s ethics. It seems that Dr. Desai’s colleagues are not surprised by this scandal and they either had no channel to raise their concerns or they were not taken seriously. Damage done."

At so many steps, other professionals could have pulled the plug, but they instead protected him.  They should all be liable. Perhaps Dr. Desai is related to Donald. Similar MO.  Desai needs to have have his license removed.  We never blame the victim, but many years ago I had a very bad surgery experience.  I found out later the doctor had other suits against him.  After that, I researched carefully every doctor I used and kept to those only  in the highest regard.  I have not a bad medical experience after that.  So please be aware. Some doctors are bad.

Major channels, like CNN, rushed you judgment like they always do when it comes to Trump, that people are “dying because of Hydroxychloroquine” and was surprisingly silent when Dr Desai’s paper was debunked. Times did hitch that bandwagon, but I’m glad it has chosen to correct the lie, belatedly though. Still laudable!"
2020-07-27 21:33:53,"So, what's the word on the effectiveness of the anti-malarial drugs?  Can the president authoritatively stand up at the next ""briefing"" and claim he was right all along about hydroxychloroquine?  It's nothing short of shameful how all this has become so politicized, thanks in large part, I would say, to Fox News."
2020-07-27 21:36:04,"It's not so much that he's a con artist, which he is, but that the medical/research community has been complicit as he has progressed in his career.  There were enough warning signals during his training that someone should have intervened and blocked his progress, his graduation.  This situation is equivalent to the school system passing the student rather than go through the aggravation of holding the student back, with the consequence of an illiterate graduate.  That Dr. Desai was brilliant compounds this sin as he has so negatively affected his patients and the research community.  Everyone that ignored his transgressions and ""passed the trash"" should be shamed."
2020-07-27 21:50:42,Keep it simple - take away his license to practice medicine.
2020-07-27 21:55:52,"The press was so hungry for anti-Trump studies/conclusions that they swallowed Mr. Desai/Harvard's fraud - hook, line and sinker.    Just like the swallowed the lies about the Russia collusion hoax.   The media's willingness to throw reason aside to promote partisan fantasies is unsettling."
2020-07-27 21:31:56,"Dr. Desai sounds like a one-man traveling disaster area. 

He has lied repeatedly; repeatedly been found wanting; and yet been enabled to continue on his self-scheduled rise by too many colleagues and supervisory doctors.

Physicians, heal yourselves!"
2020-07-27 21:38:47,"During the not one but TWO occasions when there were efforts to flunk him out and expel him from medical program or job, this should have been done. He should have been expelled and he should have been fired. Megalomanic narcissism has no place in the helping professions. Hard to believe the ethics of keeping on a doctor that no other doctor in the hospital trusts anything he says about patients....Duh."
2020-07-27 21:55:05,"I place the blame   for the retracted articles squarely on the shoulders of the editors of the journals.  So called High Impact journals thrive on quickly publishing papers on trendy  topics because these papers receive a lot of publicity, and  they tend to be cited a lot, which contributes to the impact factor of the journal.  During the Zika virus crisis, Nature, Cell, Science and other ""high impact"" journals rushed to publication papers that were trivial and, often, plain inaccurate. This behavior by journal editors encourages scientists to perform hurried and flawed experiments because they see an opportunity to publish that all important career transforming paper.   How on earth could the NEJM and Lancet publish these two papers without verifying the source data and asking the authors to deposit the raw data sets?  The Journal editors and their staff must be held accountable for taking short cuts, their terrible judgement and for promoting a publishing culture that encourages this behavior. NYT how about a similar expose on the journal editors?"
2020-07-27 21:28:22,"It is disturbing, especially at this time when so many people are ready to discount scientists, to have this high profile study be retracted.  
However, this is how science works!!  People questioned the conclusion of the study and asked to see the data and study design.  The improprieties were quickly exposed.  The Scientific Method worked as its supposed to, again.  This is good.
Many people are upset that the scientific community is changing it's collective mind on COVID-19.  But that is what we should expect to happen.  As studies are done throughout the world, new data is added, discounted and changed.  We should be amazed and proud at what scientists world wide are doing to combat this disease.
Science is working through a maze.  Many of the paths lead to dead ends."
2020-07-27 21:32:13,"I think Mr Desai's eagerness to succeed exceeded his willingness to serve people. This is a profession where there is no quick way to stardom. It is dedication, hard work, and sweat. I would see if he had a childhood where he was pushed to excel and was set unrealistic expectations"
2020-07-27 21:33:50,"Good thing he didn't run for president. With a liar like that, we could end up with hundreds of thousands dead, massive unemployment, complete loss of respect from the rest of the world, hospitals over-run, riots in the streets.....oh....."

2020-07-27 21:58:01,"Before it is too late the NYT has got to stop using weasel words and Newspeak.
We have the largest vocabulary of any language we have more than twice the words of any other language. We can call Dr Desai a conman, a flimflam artist, a scoundrel, a rogue or a fraudster. That is what his resumee tells us he is and has always been why are we looking for evidence that he isn't what is written on his resumee."
2020-07-27 22:16:15,He sounds like Presidential material
2020-07-27 22:15:37,"I'm not a  psychiatrist or psychologist, but in my profession have done a fair amount of research into sociopathy. I would bet there's a good chance Desai is a sociopath, and the most dangerous kind: A very smart one."
2020-07-27 22:16:49,"Warning Flags were present throughout his professional life.

Why were they not taken seriously ?

Why didn't the Journals ask to see his data ?

Why are ""Experts"" capable of such shallow thoughts ?"
2020-07-27 22:21:42,"This is hardly surprising.  Our culture has been soft on the truth for a very long time.

I remember being at a convention that had a speaker who had published one of those how to be ""excellent"" books.  He had ""studied"" many very ""successful"" people in business, sports, medicine, research, etc.  Then he made this comment, and I quote.

""Do you know what all of these people had in common... they all cheated.""  He went on to laud such behavior as daring, provocative and just what you needed to do to be successful.

Frankly, I was appalled.  I am not a shrinking violet, nor self-righteous, but my advice to those I have mentored is, tell the truth.  Even and especially when it is inconvenient.  You will develop a reputation as someone who can be trusted.

This was in 1984.  If I gave you this guy's name and book title you would recognize it immediately.

For obvious reasons that would not be prudent, but suffice it to say, when a guy with a top bestseller in how to be successful is advocating cheating you can see  how America can tolerate lies, liars and worse statistics."
2020-07-27 22:12:44,"This article also highlighted the layers of negligence by supervisors, ignoring warnings/complaints by multiple individuals, and allowed such an untrustworthy character to rise to the top and cause significant damage to the scientific community and to our society."
2020-07-27 22:24:57,"This reminds me of a certain type of physician. Pains in the neck to work with. Not only do they believe that all their colleagues are blind to the fantastic opportunities and benefits that only their own business acumen, credentials and entrpreneurship can see, they're also allergic to doing any proper work - usually because they're 'so busy'. Some of them seem near psychopathic in their disconnection with the norms of medical practise.

I must have worked (transiently) with a half dozen of this type over 40 years. For them, happily, those bright lights burned out quickly and they faded into obscurity. I still occasionally hear - about some of them - invariably peddling some breathtakingly audacious 'get rich quick' scheme."
2020-07-27 22:23:24,"It is good that this article sheds light on the curious story of Dr. Desai and Surgisphere.  However, I become increasingly frightened by the possibility that Truth and Honesty are now out of date, as the formerly great United States of America speeds downhill in quite a few areas.
I do continue to believe that most folks are honest and truthful, and care for their fellow beings."
2020-07-27 22:48:08,Yes there are rouge medics everywhere. But that is why there are checks and balances . Harvard professors who were on the paper with him have to share the blame. What has happened to them ? Have they gone Scott free? It is not enough to say that they trusted the data of this doctor. What were they doing letting a paper that had such an impact have their name on it go through without having a look at the data themselves. Finally - the journal editor have to shoulder some blame on not scrutinising enough.
2020-07-27 22:50:23,"Each doctor along the way who passed this resident and intern along and up to the next level, should feel horribly guilty. 

This is particularly true of Dr. Safi, the chief attending doctor, who refused to fail him as he should have--
""Instead of failing him, he [Safi] said, he gave Dr. Desai an opportunity to work on his professionalism and interpersonal skills.""  What kind of proper process and thought checking is this Safi using?  I hope that they change their procedures on reviewing residents!!

Desai subsequently was directly responsible for one person's death, another's loss of a leg, and there is more, I'm sure.

When it was discovered as an intern that he could not be depended on for thorough and honest patient care, he should have been booted out, ASAP.

I blame part of this lack of booting him out of medical school on laziness on the part of the faculty and staff, as well as allowing a narcisstic sociopath to draw them into his lies and cheating.

If he had been a white person, especially a white woman, he would have been kicked out so fast that his head would spin. Instead, it seems that they allowed a horrible practiponer to graduate as a doctor.

This does not speak well for doctors that are currently practicing, and how we now should always question rather than trust our healthcare to our medical caregivers!!  

So many bad doctors out there that I've met and dealt with when working in hospitals for 11 years.

A sad sorry state of medicine."
2020-07-27 22:44:56,"Why is the title of this article ""The Doctor Behind the Disputed Covid Data"" when the primary point is that his data effectively halted the use and study of HDCQ?"
2020-07-27 22:54:16,"Dr. Desai reminds me of Dr. Robert Gallo during the early part of the HIV epidemic.  He too misrepresented information and took credit for discoveries made in France by  Dr. Luc Montagnier.  The AMA ought to revoke Dr. Desai's medical license.  It appears to me that his ego is way larger than his ethics and he is practicing money, not medicine.  He should never have been granted a license in the first place."
2020-07-27 22:47:14,It turns out that Trump might be right after all about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine now that Dr. Sapan Desai's study contradicting Trump's claim has been retracted.
2020-07-27 22:49:33,"Really sad tale on so many levels.
Disruptive for much needed research on Covid-19 and undermines trust of public in the academic research. It was already shaken. The point of peer review, especially in top journals should be to verify that results are based on sound data and methodology.
Lancet has done it again. MMR paper by Andrew Wakefield was based in forged data. We know that now, but 20  year later still causes harm and kills children around the world through measles outbreaks. 100,000  every year!"
2020-07-27 22:28:59,"While this doctor should be held personally liable for his misdeeds, the others in the picture should not be let scot free either.

How come a Harvard Professor was eager to put his name on a study that he didn't even see the data for? What were the peer reviewers thinking by not properly assessing the results, especially with their potential for grave impact?"
2020-07-27 22:31:42,I am a scientist who has published in major journals. I would never ever put my name on a paper for which I couldn't look at the underlying data.
2020-07-27 22:39:26,"All legitimate journals require all co-authors to sign statements that they have reviewed the data, as well as provide disclaimers regarding conflict of interest and funding information, etc. The fact that he did not share the raw data with his co-authors, and they didn’t balk at that secrecy shows that they, too, have lost any reputation for honesty. I would be suspicious of their prior publications, since they put a rush to publish ahead of scientific integrity. Just because some of them have big names doesn’t absolve them."
2020-07-27 22:42:13,"Trump Administration has politics fully aligned in ""prosecuting this doctor"", why is it not doing?

Why has the Media not asked that question directly to Presiden or his staff in all these pressers?

It is clear that various types of prosecutions (Federal and State) can be pursued against this doctor. Any criminal investigations a possibility?"
2020-07-27 23:04:45,"Anybody playing games with life and death should be removed from medical profession. Covid is not joke. What is Dr.Desai’s motive? If Desai is lying or doing some mischievous game, the he should loose his professional license."
2020-07-27 23:02:36,These incidents are the reason we do not know who to believe. I will continue to listen only to Dr Fauci because of his credentials.
2020-07-27 22:56:38,"At least some of the pre-publication reviewers of the papers in the NEJM and The Lancet ought to have had the same objections as the post-publication critics. Why didn't they? Is there a problem with how these journals choose reviewers? Was there too much editorial or publisher pressure to publish quickly? 

This disturbing portrait of Dr. Desai certainly sounds plausible but real people tend not to be one-dimensional villains out of screenplays, as he is portrayed here. Whoever he is, though, he's not the only one at fault for promulgating his misinformation. The gatekeeping didn't work and badly needs to be fixed."
2020-07-27 22:56:52,"He graduated  from an American University with an MD PhD, did his residency in a well respected institution and kept moving from one place to another leaving poorly treated patients.
Everyone knew and nobody said anything, why?
Most common reason: residency program directors don't want to have a lawsuit on their record, especially from a US graduate and usually pass the buck to the future place of employment. 
Another common reason: people still fall for titles, an MD and PhD must be better than a ""plain"" MD, right? And a MBA on top of that, wow, he must be smart!
Also consider hospital logic: surgeons are money makers and since profits are important,  who care about patient's  safety."
2020-07-27 23:10:02,What is not clear in this article is to what degree Dr. Desai's study influenced the use of antimalarial drugs for Covid19.  Did the FDA issue cautions as a result ONLY of Desai's work? Or did other more bona fide studies support their conclusions?
2020-07-27 23:16:11,"This is shocking news. But this is most dissapointing journalism, because it doesn't acknowledge the burning question on all our minds: Is hydroxychloroquine now in good standing as a treatment for Covid?"
2020-07-27 23:19:07,"Pretty obvious by now, the guy is a fraud. 
1. What is so broken about the medical teaching and accreditation system that he gets his MD and a license to operate?
2. What is so broken about medical / scientific journals that they don’t catch this outright?

How many more frauds are being amplified and foisted on an unwitting, trusting public? And how long until we abandon the value of truth altogether?"
2020-07-27 23:20:17,This is why I will remain skeptical and dubious of any covid vaccine that is rushed out. Let the maga hatters and trump be the first ones in
2020-07-27 23:26:50,"Desai is a typical product of the mercantile greed. Look at his attitude: graduated from UIC in 1 year at age 19. Why? What was the big rush? Then, he was smart and hardworking - always trying to be at the frontline’s, but does not ask for guidance from his supervisors while on a training program? Why? 

All these reflect the typical “desi” mindset. To show that desis are good and competitive in this mercantile culture that rewards speedy performance. Maybe that is why he was liked by Trump. Both want to hog the limelight."
2020-07-27 23:27:28,Maybe he gave trump his physical too?
2020-07-27 23:16:28,"this is the kind of behavior that may literally put peoples lives at risk, yet the medical community seems reluctant or even unwilling to police it's own ranks and remove the incompetent, the dishonest and the outright quacks. i think the public deserves an answer."
2020-07-27 23:21:54,But those conclusions about hydroxychloroquine and patients with cardiovascular issues turned out to be correct didn’t they?  Not that I am supporting his dubious and unethical methods but I think the article should acknowledge that.
2020-07-27 23:14:12,Another question to ask about doctors is why some of them are obese.  I have read that nutrition is elective and often shunned.  I am a retired teacher and wonder why we accept a pill for a symptom instead of healing.  Teachers are praised or blamed for the outcomes of students but we still pay doctors for service instead of for healing.
2020-07-27 23:19:03,"I got an MBA in three months. I was there for 2 years, but I only   did 3 months worth of work. I wonder if I could get an MD with the same amount of effort?"

2020-07-28 00:04:51,"As a person of Indian origin, i am thoroughly ashamed that a person with whom i share a cultural heritage would do such a thing.  Mr. Desai seems like the product of an unethical upbringing.    I would recommend that the medical establishment annul his license to practice medicine."
2020-07-27 23:53:12,"May Dr. Desai's model going forward be Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, who had to recant several times.

He is not the only person who should be held accountable for this mess. All the people who doubled checked his work should have taken this issue up  with administration. It was not just one person but many who allowed this behavior to continue.  This man has an MD and is responsible for human lives. Unacceptable."
2020-07-27 23:41:56,"As has been pointed out by many, why is the first author not being condemned?  His tenure and academic position should be terminated. He is getting away with not even a slap on the wrist?  Reminds me of Dr. David Baltimore.  These academic “bigwigs” literally get away with abuse, cheating etc.  It is time the Harvard professor pays a price."
2020-07-28 00:15:36,"At a time when the novel coronavirus cases and deaths are spiking in parts of the United States because people are not wearing face masks and social distancing, the apparently fake studies by the entrepreneurial Dr. Desai have done great harm. 

By reporting that patients treated with chloroqine and hydroxychloroquine were five times as likely to have abnormal heart rhythms, Dr. Desai seemed to debunk one of Donald Trump's early recommendations. Now that the debunking has been debunked, Trump will be even more likely to play the victim and to come up with more conspiracy theories.

Just what we need."
2020-07-27 23:59:57,"Like President, like doctor.   This is the we world of Trump.  Lie and cheat your way to fame.  Fame is the sum.  They both need to be taken down as examples.  We’ve suffered enough from this kind of behaviour."

2020-07-28 00:16:58,"The failure of medical journals like the Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine to properly vet the numerous papers being submitted during the pandemic is unconscionable. It was inevitable that poorly sourced papers based on questionable data would be published and retracted muddying the waters of essential research during this crisis. This is especially troubling what with politicians like Trump and other charlatans pushing fake and dubious “treatments and cures” for Covid. There are opportunists everywhere and some have PHD and MD behind their names and visions of wealth and fame in their eyes. Try a little more due diligence eh, for all our sakes."
2020-07-28 00:47:27,Why was this study covered so extensively without examining this doctor?
2020-07-28 00:58:13,"Another example of wrong winning over right. People doing the easy thing (just letting Dr. Desai continue his training, begin a fellowship, get hospital privileges etc.) rather than the right thing. Probably because of the small risk of an unsubstantiated lawsuit. So many examples in large scale everywhere: Republican Senators looking the other way in hearings, party goers with no masks who will get stimulus checks, children being pushed along without education? so, so many examples where right is ignored. When does this end? Where did right and wrong go? There are consequences!"

2020-07-28 00:32:08,"Well, let's not blame this one guy. He's the goat, right? What about Harvard, Lancet, etc.? We got rotten apples every where. The real tragedy is that they all have gone silent to start over again some where. As long as we keep tolerating rotten apples, the apples just keep on rotting."
2020-07-28 00:53:43,Call this what it is - entitlement + grandiosity + arrogance + validation seeking + blame shifting + lack of empathy and solicitude for vulnerable patients = narcissism.

Second chances merely embolden people like this - they don’t change.

A smart person with a major personality disorder who happens to be a MD, which makes this guy quite dangerous. He displayed his confidence game skills in med school and onto his residency and then in his post-residency position/s. What is it about medical school and residency programs that they retain a med student /resident who repeatedly demonstrates over the years and various rotations to be unreliable and one who conceals information & demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to work in teams (the core of medical practice)? So this guy sold himself as a 'wunderbar student-resident-physician.' When his cohort groups documented his practice & ethical violations to faculty or superiors, the concerns were not taken as serious enough or dismissed. Flares were popping. He repeatedly got 'passes"".  The medical schools and residency programs were complicit: that is the only conclusion. And as he kept getting away with violations. He rose to research; he generated false metadata and conclusions for major medical journals. And why would anyone be shocked and dismayed. Track the root cause, people. This creep worked his con for years in academia and medical education. The general population should shudder and demand medical schools account for the series of violations they sanctioned. A post-mortum or after-action report should be done by each institution and program in which this guy was enrolled. That is for starters."

It was a matter of roution that incompetent, unethical, cheaters, liars, sexual assaulters were promoted and graduated even when caught red handed. This was because the universities do not want the financial risk or reputations hit to fire these losers. Once you are in you complete the program no matter what.

As far as anyone can tell after reading the article, no trained virologists or molecular biologists were part of the initial peer review committees that validated Sapan’s data. He certainly knows what moves the medical publishing business, and he took advantage of it. Mds are usually not valued for their clinical skills, but for the number of articles published.

All those red flags and this guy ends up giving Trump ammo for his lies.   This guy is not the problem.  The system that pushed him into a role within our nightmares is corrupt and dangerous.
2020-07-28 01:49:51,"Dr Desai is a con man. Such a person
always has an excuse for doing the
wrong thing when caught. He aroused
suspicion at every place but managed to get away with some fanciful explanation. He cast aspersion on
the reputation of Harvard professor
and the two prestigious journals in
medicine. Finally he has been exposed.
Hopefully he will be kept arm's length."
2020-07-28 02:16:14,"Look at all the red flags that had been waved around so often about Dr. Desai's cavalier and irresponsible behavior.  Sad to say, but these manipulators and self-serving dangerous individuals do exist in medicine--and in lots of other jobs as well.  But of course, the consequences of lying and behaving irresponsibly, and unethically does do damage, but in medicine the damage can mean people's lives.

I thought this was an especially astute comment: “He was essentially a giant roadblock that you had to work around,” said Dr. Olcese..."" And we know someone else, who is currently occupying the White House and presidency who fits that description perfectly.  

When did lying, incompetence and damaging behavior become acceptable?  But it is, especially if people condone it, excuse it, and/or vote for it."
2020-07-28 02:19:10,"Unverifiable data is dubious. We know that from Theranos as well. If someone hides behind proprietary data, medical journals should not publish the article.

When I say absentee, I mean literally 3 days in person and fewer than half a dozen phone calls since shortly after his child’s first birthday. I remember so clearly the way he’d stay up until all hours of the night to work on “one more paper” for publication or hone a talk for yet another professional conference. And I clearly remember the side-long glances from his colleagues, who frequently talked behind his back after learning, the hard way, not to trust much of what he said. These guys give real scientists a bad name while leaving paths of pain, malpractice, and suffering in their wake. Truly, all they care about is themselves."
2020-07-28 02:50:40,"To restore public trust in science, and the integrity of the scientific process, we need open source publishing if not of all academic papers (although a strong case may be made for that as well), then definitely of all the raw data behind each and every academic publication. You refuse to share you data with the world - no publication of your research. Then, we need to abolish the ridiculous grant system, when most money that theoretically go to fund science, in fact goes to pay granting agencies, grant-writers etc. A lot of other things are wrong with how scientific research is currently organized, but it's too long for a comment secion"

In both cases, their respective professions had adequate forewarning of their aberrant behaviors.  Neither profession lived up to its responsibilities to society.  

To be counted as a ""profession"", its members must be willing to take out their own garbage, to clean up their own corridors.  Both law and medicine, regrettably, have degenerated and begun to behave like clubs or unions.  They protect their own, make excuses, rationalize, and fail to hold members to account.  

It's time both took up the reins and reestablish themselves as true professions."

They have never made a mistake, they are all-knowing in all areas, and their words are sacrosanct.  Obviously, the people behind this attack on one of our heroes are Trump supporters from red states who deserve to die alone from COVID-19 after infecting all of their older relatives.

I just watched ""Better Call Saul"" post Covid-19, and felt differently about Saul, the lawyer who is all about winning, whatever it takes. We must stop admiring such people as winners, they do the world no favors. 

In the case of a doctor this disease is serious and we all understand the consequences. The same problem persists in other professions too, where the impact of such unethical behavior is not immediately apparent, but has a devastating effect on the entire country or even the entire world. Remember Boeing Max? Uber? Volkswagen? We have to get serious and start fixing such problems, otherwise we'll only get more Trumps, Modis and Putins in every sphere."

Now, everyone will pretend they were innocent so they can throw this Dr Desai under the bus and claim he was solely responsible for all the bad data & the hasty conclusions."
2020-07-28 03:39:18,I would also like to point out that the Harvard professors who published with this man were not called out.  They should be.  Only after readers asked for the data did the co-authors insist on seeing  it.  Dr Mehra's own greed should also be admonished.  They are as complicit in this crime and should not be allowed to hide behind it.  The journals and Harvard are trying to protect their own reputation when they are very much at fault for publishing this garbage in  the first place.  It was obvious to most of us who read it that this was falsified data.
2020-07-28 05:00:03,"As a retired scientist who researched in academics and biotech, it's no surprise to learn of yet another example of repeated, borderline incompetence and trysts with fraud to advance a biomedical career.  The saving grace is that the perpetrator is inevitably, if belatedly, caught, but the tragedy is all the harm left in his or her wake.  Perhaps the solution is for the biomedical community to stop advancing such persons out of a mistaken sense of charity, especially if and when past milestones are also known to be met just by charity."
2020-07-28 03:53:10,"Leaving all things said about Dr. Desai aside, which everyone has covered so well, what is surprising is that the 3 co-authors, from Harvard, put their name on the paper without checking/understanding any of the details.

2020-07-28 04:47:32,"Until the 1970s, at Oxbridge most of the professors would not publish a book for ten years. Some of them may have been lazy. But there was a different view of research then. The desire to do thorough research, to really ponder an issue or idea, polish, and publish a comprehensive work was strong. Then came the publish or perish era, largely thanks to North American academia. I realize medicine is a special field. We need results as soon as possible. But sometimes we should remember to slow things down, do research properly, and forget about being the first or the fastest or the most prolific."
2020-07-28 04:14:12,"Unfortunately, this type of behavior is not uncommon. Medical academia is full of half-truth tellers, corner cutters, and people of unbelievable (not believable, better said) productivity. The writing is always all over the wall, and anyone that takes science seriously, and is not utterly gullible, can spot the con-scientists from miles away. Still, the institutions turn a blind eye, while garnering money (from grants and contracts) and some momentary misbegotten form of prestige, only to quickly claim incorruptibility when the hitherto superstar is caught red-handed"
2020-07-28 05:39:44,This doctor was able to graduate from both a residency and a fellowship with a documented history of lying (or worse) at both programs. It says a lot about graduate medical education in this country if lying about patient care is not completely disqualifying.

The digi-revolution has clearly made the world a far more complex, time-consuming environment, against which only the very stalwart are willing to examine what is submitted as ""research findings"". The effects are felt profoundly in academia and the professions. 
This is, however, only one of the many challenges presented by ""instant 'knowledge'""."

2020-07-28 06:52:58,"This guy is apparently a shameless self-promoter, the kind of which exist in all corners of society, but fortunately somewhat less in the medical field. He was able to ride the wave, but it seems that he did bite more than he could chew..

As for the journals, they were initially duped, given Dr. Desai's association with the more accomplished, senior author, Dr. Mehra ( as well as with the other author of the New England Journal of Medicine article, Dr. Amit Patel, with whom Dr. Desai is reportedly related by marriage). But eventually the peer review process worked, and the lack of verifiable data forced the retraction of multiple articles by these authors. The consequences on Dr. Desai's career are unclear as of yet, but this is going to be a dark stain on Dr. Mehra's reputation.

In conclusion, we should still believe our scientific and medical institutions, where falsehoods are not easily accepted. But the same cannot be said about the current American political institutions, including the Presidency and Congress, where falsehood is rampant. This is one of the main reasons for America's current tenuous position in the world."
2020-07-28 08:07:55,"I had an attending neurosurgeon just like him in medical school.  Also an Indian-American.  He had a brilliant mind, and was incredibly well-versed in the medical literature.  The problem was that he was a horrible surgeon, which is a large part about physical stamina, skill and intuition, in balance with technical knowledge. He was so bad at surgery that once a resident called up a patient anonymously and told them they should get a different surgeon. The patient told the administration and a hurricane commenced. In the end, the neurosurgeon sued the institution alleging racial discrimination, and he moved on, after a settlement. I never saw an ounce of discrimination- the department was actually quite diverse. Unfortunately, he was just a bad surgeon who projected fair questions about his skills toward his ethnicity.  He would have been brilliant had he just stuck to medical academics, for which he was well-suited, but, IMO, his ego wouldn't allow that. He wanted the prestige of being in the operating room, to the misfortunate of many patients."

2020-07-28 04:50:49,"... that's why journals shouldn't publish studies until they have been peer reviewed.  There are reasons for very strenuous scientific redundancy tests.  Assuming the doctor had the data he claimed, there would still need to be an evaluation of the data, to examine faults, redundancy, typos etc. In the data.  That there didn't actually turn out to be data is just plain fraud.  People are afraid and want quick answers.  Science rarely provides quick answer.   Everything, needs to be checked and rechecked.  There are those with brilliant insight, who maybe right.  But proving the rightness of a hypothesis is what matters.  Scientific rigor matters. 
Journals want to be the first to report a new finding.  But a finding isn't a finding until it has been replicated. It's a suggestion. 

Even a legitimate study, without bias or fraud can get it wrong.  Americas reporting systems are extremely vulnerable to error for several possible reasons. 

Arrogance:
Americans are sure someone knows the answer because we think we know everything.

Stupidity:
Americans don't believe in the scientific process because it is slow.  And they believe slow is faulty.  And that is just stupid.  America has come to worship speed; fast cars, fast rockets & fast science.  All three kill people.  

High tolerance for collateral damage: Americans are just fine with people dieing.  Even when it's them. 150,000 dead & they hardly blink.

Now we know why the President has threatened to sue any  institution that apparently educated him, if they made public his educational attainment tests.   It is widely believed President Trump has a problem with learning and reading.

Why did the renowned journals that published Desai's work on COVID-19 then retract them after doubts were cast by researchers around the world who challenged what they found as Desai's dubious data.

My graduate studies at Oxford University were overseen by one of my  supervisors,  who  completed his renown doctoral thesis in two years.  Anyone  who boasts having an MBA that was earned in three months from an online university  surely has to come under very close scrutiny, especially when he is acting as a physician.  Why do co-authors of medical papers assign their name for a paper destined for publication when they have not even examined the raw data on which a paper was based?  It is a legitimate question now to ask whether  medical journals regularly publish papers on which the data has not been read by the co-authors.  Moreover, do medical journals like The Lancet publish papers only because of who it is claimed wrote them?"

Trying to write about Covid care plans is the real challenge. Those are important meta analysis to discover and compile. This doctor is negligent and controlling and dishonest.

Basic nursing care at the first signs of infection rule the survival outcomes. If a sick patient isn’t that sick it isn’t a “ sit and wait it out at home time”..,. Nursing care actions are needed stat. Yet no articles on what nursing staff has done to prevent the ultimate degradation to a human body. Respirators / vents. To breath for the patient.

They were allowed to graduate and proceed into their PhD programs, and this way they were both enabled to have other students under their tutelage. They're probably destroying some other people's future right now, as they have students under their tutelage.

Desai's circa 2008 residency at Duke University medical center overlaps with that of disgraced Duke Dr. Anil Patti who resigned from Duke University in 2010 and had 18 papers either retracted or corrected because of fraudulent data manipulation. The irony is that Desai is the ""Author to whom correspondence should be addressed"" for the  5 November 2013 published paper 'Combating Fraud in Medical Research: Research Validation Standards Utilized by the Journal of Surgical Radiology'.  That paper extensively discusses Patti's fraud.  So apparently, not only has Desai later engaged in similar data manipulation frauds, but he cloaked himself in the mantle of knight errant in the pursuit of medical fraud.  I recall at the time Desai's original corona-virus studies were being released, concerns were raised about the danger of cutting corners in the rapid release of ""ground breaking"" medical results in the absence of traditional and methodical peer review."

The description of Dr. Desai is not that unusual in medicine nor is the way the various program "" passed him along"".  They are as guilty as Dr. Desai of perpetrating a fraud on the public but failure to have the conviction and courage to confront these individuals and to certify their training is a great weakness in our system.

2020-07-28 13:40:13,"Mr. Desai’s fraudulent study against Hydrochloroquine was enthusiastic taken up by the media including the NYTimes. And they should have apologized in this article. Politics should never come in the way of science either way - for or against.

While hydrochloroquine is not a cure for Covid and never was designed for it, it was seen as a promising drug and was safely being used by rheumatoid arthritis patients for decades. It was suddenly portrayed as some dangerous drug with horrible side effects. Detailed research on it’s covid effectiveness will take months or years, too late for patients who wouldn’t be alive. Meanwhile China and India used it as an experimental drug that they saw could benefit some patients, Americans lost that opportunity."
2020-07-28 11:42:10,"I personally think this is a good example of why we shouldn't rely on just one person when making decisions especially on something that we haven't experienced before, especially with the current pandemic.

There should always be checks and double checks.  There should be panels of looking at other studies and questioning of findings.

The same goes with Dr. Fauci, he may be a great physician but he is human and can make mistakes but the government is making all these changes based on what he says.  Instead it should be take what he says and talk with others in the same field and other fields. Like this doctor, there were studies going on with this anti malyeria (sp?) Drug so instead of letting this doctor publish his findings and going on what he States, they should have taken what he said and compared it to the studies and trials of the drug that was being used and showing positive outcomes.  Also why didn't they look into his history before jumping in on that he was the only expert.  They would have seen that he lied about having a law degree, they would have seen the complaints years earlier that some of the chief residents were saying, they would have seen that he wasn't taken seriously on what he would state on patient care that they double checked his work, and most of all they would have seen the 4 lawsuits pending against him in 2019.  All these would have been a red flag to double check him and his accuracy."
2020-07-28 13:57:25,"A doctor that lies can cost a patient their life.  

Another cost is a loss of scientific trust.  Now the anti-science people can cite this as ""proof"" that science is a lie.  

A scientist committing fraud can cause people to reject scientific truths.   Creationist still cite Piltdown man as proof that human evolution is a lie.  Even though scientist recognize that piltdown man was a hoax and there is other overwhelming evidence of human evolution."
2020-07-28 13:59:12,"This fraud changed medical practice around the world. People probably died because of it. I hope there is a federal criminal investigation underway because if crimes were committed, they need to be prosecuted vigorously in this case. Too much is at stake to allow this kind of behavior to go unpunished."
2020-07-28 14:11:15,"Ambitious, ego-driven doctors with dreams of fame have always been around, through many centuries.

The failure here, as so often elsewhere, is that respected peer-reviewed scientific/medical journals expect to receive rigorous pre-publication peer reviews, of all submitted articles, by scientists who (1) understand the content of what they’re reviewing, (2) maintain very high standards, (3) carefully review all submitted articles, and (4) reject the articles that do not reflect rigorous scientific discipline, and interpret results appropriately.

Thus the fault here is, yes, with Dr. Desai, but much more so with the editors of The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet, who gave Desai’s articles worldwide exposure.

Those journals promulgated later-retracted articles, based on tainted studies their peer reviewers and editors should have rejected. 

Shame on Dr. Desai, but shame, too, in spades, on The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. One wonders whether what those journals are publishing now reflects any “lessons learned,” and any corrective measures they took, after these disastrous hits to their credibility."
2020-07-28 14:03:45,"If this is what can happen in our mad rush to find treatments/therapeutics for Covid-19, what's to say the same or something similar cannot happen in our warp speed rush to create a vaccine? Or is the vaccine field somehow magically exempt from having bad scientists/doctors/regulatory agencies?"
2020-07-28 14:07:53,"And yet to this day CNN et al use primarily this study to describe Hydroxychloriquine as ""dangerous"", ""controversial"" and many other scary adjectives.  Why?  Because President Trump promoted it's use.  Period.  Most of the main stream media have discarded any attempt at actual news journalism, for the self appointed job of being the Trump/ Republican opposition party.  So... let's set some things straight about this medication.  1) No one can get it without a doctor's prescription.  What Trump thinks about it doesn't matter, what your and other doctors think does.  And it's evident by the number of doctors prescribing it or taking it that they think it has valid use. If you suspect your doctor is taking medical cues from Trump you need a new doctor more than you need a new president.  2) Hydroxychloriquine is a safe drug that had been approved for use in auto-immune diseases like Lupus and RA and taken for decades by thousands or millions of patients.  Will it help with Covid?  Maybe, maybe not.  But it is a safe drug to try for a disease that, especially early on, we really didn't have any good options.

So... quit politicizing this drug, or any other treatments, in either direction and let the medical professionals do their best to treat us for this novel disease."

The whole idea of going into the medical system as a means of wealth and fame is the polar opposite of what it means to take the ""OATH"" of first do no HARM. Sapan is clearly one of those far more interested in his own ambition than really looking out for the general health and welfare of Americans; and represents the cancer of profit over care that makes your nation sick."
2020-07-28 14:49:08,"Dr. Desai lied, published his lies in presumably respected journals BEFORE peer review.  That's the issue; not just one man lying to promote himself, but others going along.  The same happened in the UK when it was published that vaccines caused autism over 2 decades ago, yet millions still believe the since retracted 'findings.'

The other issue is that his lies and cutting corners are not new, but have continued throughout his career.  And, none of his colleagues came forward.  We know the police stand behind each other, as do teachers; seems all professions tend to circle themselves and protect the bad apples.  If the punishment was real, perhaps there would be fewer cases?  Don't know, but doubt it.  We defend 'our own' even in the face of evidence to the contrary.  

Lastly, I know of a number of physicians and researchers around the world that claimed the findings that hydrochloroquine increased chance of death as nonsense from the start.  No one in the US was willing to listen, as Trump embraced the treatment as a potential cure.  Hatred for Trump hides the truth as much, maybe more.  Review the Henry Ford Hospital study; it was peer reviewed and published."
2020-07-28 14:50:24,"Let’s get logical about this:
- the story discusses a physician that allegedly promotes a data set that says hydroxychloroquine / anti malaria drugs are not effective against COVID19
- the above statement fact would point to several possible logical conclusions:
1.  The physician is at minimum trying to make money off the current mainstream media narrative that anything Trump promotes is a lie; and also possibly has political animosity towards Trump.   However, most likely it’s a follow the money scenario.  
2. Since the physician’s “study” is counter to Trump, then he would not be next in line for Surgeon Genera or in any way part of the Trump administration. 
3. Since the “study” was so easily published without verification in a well knowN and “well respected” Journal, One should conclude that the Journal had political animosity towards Trump. 
4. And Yale epidemiologist reports hydroxychloroquine does work.

2020-07-28 15:00:08,"For me its deja vu, all over again (with apologies to Yogi Berra.)

As an intern in a famous medical school and hospital I watched as a similar story unfolded back in the 70's.  An arrogant, bright, if not brilliant, medical Resident has a paper published in the NEJM that appears to be ground breaking.  He goes on to do a Cardiology Fellowship at another highly prestigious medical school and hospital.  His research was fake, the data fudged, the paper withdrawn.  Two medical schools and a prominent world renown cardiologist embarrassed.  

It happens.  People can be deceiving; they will flat out lie to you, and blame others for their failure.  In medicine, and in the world.  Don't be that person.  Don't fall for that person's narrative*.

2020-07-28 14:42:52,A question that needs to be asked is how can doctors with instances of questionable conduct and ethical concerns continually be passed onward and allowed to move through the system and remain practicing despite peer confidence? Who is safeguarding the public from individuals that literally hold our lives in their hands and can influence worldwide treatment through published articles? Why do we not have more accountability for the medical community in this country and a better system of checks conducted by a neutral entity? It is mind boggling and sad to see how broken our system is and to know that there are no built in safeguards against incompetent doctors.

He is a disgrace to the Hippocratic Oath he took while entering the profession. It is reasonable to assume that he quit the job because he found in the coronavirus outbreak an opportunity to make more money. Has anyone heard about a medical doctor with a mind sicker than this?

None would blame The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet for having published the papers which he, together with a few other medical professionals he fooled into collaborating with him, produced. The prestigious medical journals decided to publish them because they knew that the “public’s appetite for information” on Covid-19 “was insatiable.” By the time they withdrew the articles when it came to light that they were based on manufactured and manipulated data amassed by a company started by a greedy physician, the damage had been done.

Dr. Sapan Desai, the mercenary physician in question, may have gone silent after his bluff has been called and his studies have been retracted by the journals. But let him not be under any illusion that he will be able to remain silent for long. 

His license to practice medicine should be revoked. He should also be brought before congressional panels and questioned for having played Russian roulette with the lives of millions of people living under the coronavirus threat."
2020-07-28 04:23:51,"It is not my intention to stoke any tensions by writing the following. 

I belong to the same country as Mr. Desai. Due to invasions and foreign rule for centuries and our inability to fight, we in our country developed an art of sychophancy and conning our fellow countrymen for survival. Especially if the opposite person is good instead of respecting it, we consider it as weakness, con him/her. This has ingrained into our genes over centuries. Even after 70 years of independence we have not been able set right our society. This is evident from so many scams that take place in our country and the ease with which conmen run away from our country with help of our politicians and seek refuge in the countries like the UK. 

Coming back to the point, native Americans over past few generations, due to the wealth and riches passed on by previous generations, have become complacent, easy going, easily trusting others, gullible, etc. Due to massive immigration from our country and other countries since 1990s, native Americans need to shed their complacency, develop a critical evaluating ability towards immigrants and start trusting them only after thorough analysis. Because speed of immigration since 1990s is quite high compared to speed at which immigrants assimilate. Prior to 1990s, it was possible to migrate only by pursuing higher studies. But post 1990s it has become easy to migrate through IT. No offenses meant here. Only to improve the situation and help America."
2020-07-27 17:35:21,"I have worked in Healthcare Informatics for twelve years.  If Dr. Desai had created a tool with which ""hospitals could easily input anonymized patient data from disparate electronic health record systems, translating the information into a single, homogenized registry without technical assistance,"" he would be darn near Bezos rich. And every hospital would be jumping at the chance to use it."
2020-07-28 03:11:09,"So many commentators compare Desai to Trump. In this case, they are opposites. Of course, Trump is the ultimate charlatan in so many minds, so they reflexively invoke him. Excuse me, Desai's fraudulent paper was gleefully embraced by the popular media, who welcomed findings that suggested Trump's favorite drug killed people. Not so much publicity when the research was retracted -- it didn't fit the narrative. The facts described in this Times article, and the reaction to it, illustrates how blind bias against a public figure is so dangerous: just because Trump seized on early studies of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine didn't make the drug ineffective. It is used by hospitals and still in trials by serious researchers. In this one instance, Trump may have been right, but the hate for him disqualified the drug in so many minds that it surely has set back progress in getting it approved for wider use as one of many drug therapies that are effective at different stages of covid infection."

2020-07-31 01:39:18,"I’m glad she is doing well! Wondering not for any reasons but just curious. My sister had a double lung transplant at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia in 2018. Typically you get an allocation score. So many people with pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, lung disease and autoimmune disease are waiting for lungs. Also, the new lungs are very susceptible to infection. The anti rejection drugs are harsh too not to mention very costly. Most people have to wait for the perfect match to come in. Blood type and size. It’s not easy to have a match on demand. These people were lucky."
2020-07-31 07:34:08,"Per the Mayo Clinic, ""Although some people have lived 10 years or more after a lung transplant, only about half the people who undergo the procedure are still alive after five years."" --Jul 11, 2019

In addition to the drastically reduced life expectancy for those who receive such transplants, extra lungs are exceedingly hard to come by. Average cost of a lung transplant in 2016 was over $135,000. Then there are the costs of anti-rejection drugs, and of early hospital re-admissions (30% of patients, average cost over $27,000). 

Universal mask wearing would be a lot cheaper."
2020-07-31 11:05:43,"@Martha Shelley I am a lung transplant person. I am also counselor to over 200 folks with IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) 70% are on the national lung transplant list. Your data is incorrect. The average lifespan post transplant is now 6 t0 7 years. Further, the reason for this is NOT rejection or transplant mismatch, it is the failure of patients to maintain healthy lifestyles post transplant, maintain exercise routines, eat right and take meds correctly and obtain blood work. Last, the lifespan number includes lung transplants that die from OTHER medical issues unrelated to transplant.

From a practical standpoint, a majority of transplants I have met (over a 1000) are 10 years out or over. Given that the average transplant is mid 60's at time of transplant, most folks are already nearing the median age for end of life, so your statement of reduced life expectancy is incorrect. I was transplanted at 60 and just celebrated my 8th year, in fine health.

Lungs are NOT hard to come by. Acceptable MATCH between patient and donor CAN BE. In any event, for a majority of folks, the average wait time from listing to transplant is 3 to 6 months, as supported by data from srtr.org, the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. 

In closing, the average cost of a LUNG is 135K, not the operation, that can range from 500K to over 1million. Further, your drug price quote are also in error. Average cost per year for the main generic supression drugs are 5000 per year."

It's not only the administration failing, but also the citizens because of egoism, narcissism, and the extreme ideologies. It is not that difficult to follow some simple rules in order to protect EVERYONE. However, the administration is clearly to blame by not responding to the growing differences within the society and doing the opposite: trying to satisfy its voters with less restrict rules.  No wonder that other countries turn away from the USA and make fun of it(s leader). I hope, things get better sooner than later."

Thank you for this video."
2020-07-27 11:49:17,"The Trump administration and all the Republican governors who kept the beaches open have failed us. That is obvious.

A few days ago I called my Democratic congresswoman asking her to vote to reduce the Pentagon budget by ten percent in order to fund projects of social uplift in this crisis. She didn't. She and many other moderate Democrats voted to keep the bloated Military-Industrial complex budget right where it is.

The moderate Democrats have failed us too."
2020-07-27 11:49:38,"We are experiencing our 2nd wave here but even so, our numbers are small per capita.  You will hear people say, “thankfully we are not in the US”. We have free health care, unemployment benefits and business help, a fairly compliant nation in the main let alone an inept government. Our hearts go out the American people. Sure, we don’t get all the controls right as we have not done this before but I know where I’d rather be."
2020-07-27 11:51:41,Well that's a stark look at the reality of the situation. Getting tired of so much winning.
2020-07-27 11:52:14,It’d be nice to see responses across generations. This is such a narrow representation. I’d love to see the horrified elders as well!
2020-07-27 11:53:38,"Too many people in this country are oblivious to the truth of this pandemic. Too many are callous and selfish, touting their freedoms over the health and lives of others. I have heard too many say that the well-being of others is not their problem. I have seen people rail against wearing a mask and spit in others faces to make their point all because we have a leader who refuses to accept this is real in an effort to hold on to his position.

Then there are these young people from other countries, shaking their heads in disbelief and shock. Some shed tears over the failures of this country’s leadership as well as the failures of its population. They put their heads down in shock and sadness, feeling compassion for us, for the people of an entirely different country, one that used to be the standard by which other countries measured their success. Now we lead in lack and failure, heartlessness, selfishness and greed and others measure their success against those failures.

I cannot remember seeing a single person in this country weep over the pandemic unless it was for themselves or their own personal losses. Where did we go wrong?"
2020-07-27 11:55:57,"Were the respondents made aware that the pictures of mass graves were from what appears to be Hart Island, the potter's field used by New York City even in pre-COVID times? Yes, they have certainly been burying more people there this year. But it has been the final resting place for NYC's unclaimed deceased for many years."
2020-07-27 11:56:41,"Thank you for this. The perspective from these young faces from around the world about us is both shocking and saddening. I know we are the laughing stock of the world, and I know 140,000  people have died. But still, I’m in tears after watching this video."
2020-07-27 12:07:57,"This is what happens in a culture where education is not valued, rock stars and sports stars are worshipped, where keeping up with the Jones' is more important than caring for a neighbor. And where government is owned by corporate interests from the local level on up. America's decline is sadly on view for the entire world to see."
2020-07-27 12:08:59,"United we stand, divided we fall. Right now we are failing and falling.

We either get through this together, or there is no we. By together, I mean we collectively make the necessary sacrifices, and that we especially look after the most vulnerable. If it means we put some things on pause in order to save people's jobs, home, and security while also saving lives, that's what we need to do.

Eventually things will settle to some sort of new normal. The question is, how much do we want to determine and define our new normal? 

But to put it all in words that maybe even Trump can understand, compared to other countries, we are losing, losing, losing...BIG TIME."
2020-07-27 12:12:05,"For those of you who are looking for the closed captioning button for the video: Click on the video; when it expands, you will see the little CC button in the lower right-hand corner."
2020-07-27 12:13:04,"I've travelled to many countries in my 63 years.
America, whether it was loved or hated, was always envied. Even the young people across the globe who vehemently condemned this country always wanted to come here.
But now we are experiencing something utterly unprecedented: pity."
2020-07-27 12:13:20,"My nephew is getting married in Sept.  Yesterday his mother threw him and his fiancee a shower. We didn't attend because they live in the South, and we live in NYC.  We want to go to the wedding but the pictures from the shower just remind us why we might not go.  There were over 50 people at the shower with no social distancing, no one is wearing a mask, there are several pregnant people and more than 10 people 60 and older.  My nephew tells me that over 100 people can be at the reception, and masks are recommended but not mandatory.  Obviously, people have the right to run their wedding and reception as they see fit, and people have to decide to whether they feel safe in attending.  But as this video shows, with better and more consistent leadership, at the very least mask wearing wouldn't be a political flashpoint."
2020-07-27 12:15:25,"Sharing the burden is both a Christian and a Socialist point of view.

A tremendous number of citizens of the United States simply can't square this, even for those who claim to be Christian or Evangelical.

A civilized nation prepares itself for its 'rainy day'.  In the United States, shareholders are who have their hands out first, are first in line, and tweak the arc of politics.

A civilized nation seeks to understand:  in the United States, we blustered at the beginning of the pandemic with an ignorance that was profound, and is responsible for well over 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. ""I really like the numbers.""

If you don't share the burden, than even a country like the United States devolves into a place where it seems like scarcity is the norm:  States bidding against other States for masks, for ventilators.

And even worse, without the burden being shared, the nearly 150,000 people who have died aren't enough evidence to change the minds of those who think that freedom is the right to not wear a mask.

Covid-19 was never going to stop at any border.  Covid-19 might not even be the most lethal virus we deal with in the next 20 years.  Covid-19 has exposed the flaws and brutality of leadership based on personality and corruption.

A shared burden.  In the United States, the white, rich, and greedy only see  a bottom line that is smaller.  

The rest of us have to navigate with opening schools, with shopping, with family, with creating a safe place for our families."
2020-07-27 12:15:30,"Anyone who has lived abroad has seen this kind of reaction to America and its behaviors for at least 20 years. 

Americans with the good fortune to spend time abroad has seen the decline for at least 40 years."
2020-07-27 12:17:48,"That woman from South Korea showed far more compassion for the people who have lost their lives and their families than our own president has done.  This is part of what is missing in the US, simple empathy.  
This video is so powerful.  Thank you."
2020-07-27 12:19:17,"My wife and I have family in Greece. So we know what they did. In contrast to the U.S., the Greek government took full control of the response. They didn’t delegate the reaction to the provinces and the islands. This allowed a coordinated Greek approach.

What did Greece do? They shut down the country for over 2 months. It was strictly enforced, complete with fines. 

How did it turn out? Greece had very few deaths, and the country has begun reopening safely and gradually. 

Think about it. Greece, which is “renowned” worldwide for its dysfunctional government, and for a population that flouts rules, handled the Coronavirus far better than the much wealthier U.S. 

Can we trade Trump for Kyriakos Mitsotakis (prime minister of Greece)?"
2020-07-27 12:19:29,I certainly know how bad the US response has been - and remains. And how broken our country is right now. But seeing this video brought tears to my eyes for how much we have lost as country. It's hard to contend that we are an advanced country any more. So much rebuilding to do.
2020-07-27 12:20:11,"Thank you for this eye-opening video.  Yes, it brought some tears, and it shows us how young people around the world are seeing the US now... with disbelief and compassion.  We need to shed tears for those lost to this disease and for the failure of our leaders.  I know I am."
2020-07-27 12:22:22,"I watch with resentment as my family members in Denmark enjoy life again as the country has slowly opened up post Covid. Here we are in Boston approaching 5 months of staying home, wearing masks and generally following safety guidelines that seemed to get us nowhere. November 3rd can’t come quickly enough."
2020-07-27 12:22:28,"Very powerful. This should be broadcast, prime time, in every state of the USA."
2020-07-27 12:28:45,"I knew all of this and I'm still as floored as those kids were. What we're looking at is the result of a society that values money more than people. And that's a bipartisan problem, fostered by the policies of every administration since Nixon's. Some were more blatant, some put a smile on it, but they all helped to build it."
2020-07-27 12:31:25,"I wonder how many of Trump's supporter have any idea how the U.S. is viewed around the world now. Think about it: some 40% of the country still supports him and thinks he's doing a good job, such a good job that they plan to vote for him again in November. Even after such an epic disaster... it's truly mind blowing."
2020-07-27 12:36:17,"The part that makes me tear up is the South Korean woman. So far away, so distant from us here, and yet she has more empathy and compassion for those suffering needlessly in the U.S. than the entire Trump administration combined."
2020-07-27 12:39:47,"One thing I noticed as they described their own countries' support systems was the sense of pride or ownership in the system. In America, there is no real support system, but if there was, I'm not sure you would see the pride. There is too much resentment here to allow us to pull together. Coasts vs Midwest, Urban vs Rural, Black vs White."
2020-07-27 12:42:35,"Okay video, but the comparison between unemployment payments in other countries and the one-time payment sent out in the U.S. is a faulty one. A more accurate comparison would have been between unemployment payments in other countries and unemployment and CARES payments here. 

There's more than enough to criticize about the American response to COVID without having to resort to skewed comparisons."
2020-07-27 12:42:54,"Unlike other presidents that are judged based on good and bad decisions, Trump needs to be measured by the danger he poses to his citizens, as well as the world. Canada does 70% of its trade with America.  Our economy will feel the effects of Dangerous Don for years!"
2020-07-27 12:45:01,"Superb video. For those condemning the Dems in the comments, and play false equivalencies, remind yourselves that they are the party that brought us the Affordable Care Act, that pushes forward clean water and air regulations (the word ""regulation"" should be universally replaced with ""citizen protection""), break bread with our allies around the world, condemn our enemies and have several hundred Bills designed to help millions of Americans all log jammed by Mr McConnell. Not to mention that when Bush 43 took office the national debt was actually a surplus. What has the GOP done for us lately? Massive tax cuts to appease their donors, grandstanding obfuscation and lethal mendacity, not to mention the most unprepared, most disingenuous, most unfit for office, lowest IQ president in history. And yes the world looks on in disbelief and sadness."
2020-07-27 12:45:42,"I actually can't bear to watch this.  I already feel bad enough about my country, and how badly we are handling everything, and I just can't stand to see even more right now.

I have some hope that we can change things, enough to make a real difference, and then maybe I could go back, watch the video, and look at how far we've come from the bad old days.  This would be sometime after January, of course."
2020-07-27 12:47:48,"To be fair, comparing the U.S. to these other countries is comparing apples to oranges. The people in this video come from what we would call ""countries""--places with governments dedicated to the well-being of its citizens, their most precious resources. 

We in the U.S. function in a society in which a small group of wealthy people (most of them old, white, and male) and the stock market are all that matter as far as leadership is concerned. We people are a waste of resources and ""takers,"" as Mitt Romney would deem us."
2020-07-27 12:50:35,"I have no doubt that the blame for this disaster lies squarely on the President's shoulders.
Good leaders TELL THE HARD TRUTH - they don't make overly optimistic predictions - or worse suggest it's a political hoax - this just causes people take less precautions - and causes more cases and more deaths
LEADERS SET AN EXAMPLE - All Trump had to do was look at the camera with a mask on and say to his followers - WEAR A MASK - it  would have saved 10's of thousands of lives
TESTING TESTING - I took a test 2 WEEKS ago and don't yet have the results. Trump fears testing because more cases makes him look bad BUT the cases are still there, tests or no - and without them it causes more spread, and more death. Freely available raid testing is a key asset in the fight
QUESTIONING THE CREDIBILITY of experts causes people to doubt or ignore their advice - with predictable results
TRUMP CAUSED MANY, MANY UNNECESSARY DEATHS"
2020-07-27 12:51:04,"I wish this video was shown on all media, TV prime time included, and juxtaposed with Trump's repeated claim that the USA is the envy of the world, is doing better than all the other countries, countries that don't allow Americans entry to their countries now."
2020-07-27 12:51:39,"This video needs to be seen by as many Americans as possible. Election Day is coming.
Thanks NYTimes for putting this together."
2020-07-27 12:52:43,Seeing this through the eyes of others makes me aware of how the scale of the tragedy. Thank you to the interlocutors for their sympathy.
2020-07-27 12:55:02,"Americans have a strong strand of exceptionalism woven into our national DNA, so this video might shock some of our fellow citizens, assuming we could get them to watch it. Their faith in America as a shining city on a hill is blind. But for those of us who appreciate a global perspective, who respect the findings of science, who value learning, and who try to practice critical thinking, this video is a vindication of sorts. The pandemic has exposed America’s anti-intellectualism, but to those of us who value intellect, it has proven that we have been right all along to do so; it has confirmed that the self-doubt we have felt in our alienation was always unfounded. But the vindication is short-lived, and it quickly gives way to tears. All it takes to dispel any sense of triumph is watching a foreigner cry for our country."
2020-07-27 12:55:05,"I would be hesitant about reporting figures from China and Vietnam at face value, particularly Vietnam's amazingly low case count and claims of not a single death. (Not to mention North Korea's claims of not a single case.) These countries have no government independent information sources, the people responsible for compiling and reporting the figures are subject to the arbitrary power of higher officials responsible from making sure the country and ruling party look good, and all officials are members of the one and only political party. Do you see any conflicts of interest here?"
2020-07-27 12:58:28,"While I found the majority of the video to be phenomenal and eye-opening, I’m distracted by the way in which the federal response to unemployment is characterized for comparison.

The video compares how different nations utilize paycheck protections and wage subsidies, characterizing the federal response to the $1,200 stimulus check with no mention of the $600/week unemployment benefit. I’d argue the latter should be used as the point of comparison, as the unemployment benefit was our strategy to support massive unemployment.

To be clear, DJTs response has been an utter disaster. We need to track and record his failures correctly and this comes across as a mischaracterization that can be disputed."
2020-07-27 12:59:59,"On average, this will be met with little more than a shrug from America. U.S. citizens intrinsically believe they are the greatest society on the planet. Manifest destiny. American exceptionalism. The idea of comparing themselves to people from lesser places simply holds no meaning to them. That rote acceptance America myths also precludes any inkling that their rights and liberty are currently under threat. Unmarked government forces are literally snatching people off the street right now, but Americans are oblivious to the threat. Wilful ignorance is a poor excuse."
2020-07-27 13:00:18,Our population is massive compared to the other countries.  It is not that easy to do the things with nimble flexibility and adapatability for us as it is for populations of 20 million.  Pandemic economies and actions are not necessarily scalable.
2020-07-27 13:02:57,"There is a way to flatten the curve on the Trump virus, by voting in 99 days, and then one day (21 January 2021 to be precise) you will wake up, and it will disappear.

In the meantime stay safe, stay well."
2020-07-27 13:03:44,"One of those in the video says incredulously that the U.S. is ""like a third-world country."" That response to how we have handled the coronavirus pretty much sums it up."
2020-07-27 13:04:20,"This is the end game of the Reagan Revolution. 

This is what decades of believing conservative myths about tax cuts and anti-government propaganda have brought us to. This is what denying science has gained us, and what irrational belief in the power of free market capitalism to 'solve' any problem has left us with. This is where mindlessly promoting individual freedom while denying any responsibility to society or the common good has taken us.

But boy do we have some really, REALLY rich people.

Mission accomplished."
2020-07-27 13:04:40,"Suggestion: can the NY Times get into the habit of running informative, well-documented articles on how other countries in the developed world tackle basic issues like this?

Not just to cut through the ""we are the X-est in the world"" jibber-jabber, but to identify useful solutions and approaches that are used successfully elsewhere. To see how these might be adapted and applied (or rejected, for that matter).

The list is endless: childcare, senior living, access to healthcare, eco-friendly transport, unemployment insurance, fighting obesity, eco-friendly building regulations, gun control, waste disposal and on and on. 

I'm going to bet that coverage like this would ""reveal"" that some degree of government regulation is not only helpful, but necessary for everyone's quality of life. But hey, that's life."
2020-07-27 13:04:43,"We are broken nation.

2020-07-27 13:04:53,"Despite all the metrics measuring the wealth and development of a country, all of which the US is at or near the top.  The only metric that is counted is the response that the leadership can deliver in a catastrophe like this pandemic.  On this metric, the US has failed miserably and shamefully."
2020-07-27 13:05:23,"Let's see:  The US at 331 Million people has tens of thousands of deaths Less than the equivalent population of Britain, France  Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Sweden combined.
The Lancet just published a study anlysing policy responses to Covid across dozens of countries, and found lockdowns did NOT correlate with deaths/million.
Testing has never shown an impact on pandemic except in very small countries - esp island countries - when instituted early.   This is a classic Farr curve situation.  Our response was grossly out of proportion - esp media frenzy - to the 2017/8 flu, which killed 80,000 Americans THAT WE KNOW OF, as flu deaths were not even counted in those over 65 in places like California then, and are not directly reportable to CDC unlike Covid."
2020-07-27 13:06:58,"American Exceptionalism in its finest hour.

One cannot help wonder, though, how individual cooperation might have been different had we had thoughtful, commanding, data driven and empathetic national leadership from Day One.

2020-07-27 13:08:12,"I am a US citizen and I have lived in Europe and still have family in Finland.  I am retired now.  In my travels and work in Europe, there is no question Europeans have a higher quality of life.  I have a bigger house than the average EU citizen, but that is the only benefit I see to living in the US.   To not worry about health care, time off for new mothers and fathers,  more vacation time etc. it is unquestionably better to live in the EU and in the Nordic countries in particular.  I wish my fellow Americans could see outside of their bubble and see what is possible."
2020-07-27 13:09:53,"As an American living outside the US and watching this film it is disturbing but not shocking. Non- American admire us, at times envious us, but at times fail to understand a few basic truths about us that were the basis of the formation of the country. America is not, I repeat is not a centralized government. Most other countries are. The single biggest strength and biggest flaw is our individualism. We simply do not want gouvernement involvement in our lives. That single trait allow us to excel but in times like this works against us.  Add the lack of leadership from the Oval Office and we have a disaster."
2020-07-27 13:10:46,"This is eye opening Sometimes I wonder if being an American made me institutionalized where I feel the conditions here are the best in the world because I grew up hearing that saying the grass isn't always greener on the other side. It makes me wonder though, because one of the things that started this country, freedom of religion, is a controversy that people will attack & condemn people for both ways, I believe in God, & I feel I should be able to express that belief & anyone who feels differently should be able to express that too there is no reason why we can't respect difference in beliefs. Then the racial & socioeconomic inequalities we are facing & as Americans we need to quit fighting against each other & looking down on each other & be United and realize that it's not our ""neighbor"" we have a problem with but the institution that pits us against each other on one hand while making it look like they have our best interest at heart on the other. Veterans fought for the best interest are now get beaten & pepper sprayed in the streets for exercising the freedom they fought for, sometimes power is displayed more by showing compassion, empathy, & acceptance rather than physical force. I'm not saying that I'm not proud to be an American, but maybe that America needs to change; instead of being proud of a country, pride should be in the people, their differences & scarifies because without the people it's just a piece of land where the grass changes with the seasons."
2020-07-27 13:13:22,"By and large, these people live in countries whose governments feel a sense of responsibility for the citizens' well-being.  This is shown in many ways in addition to response to the virus.  Consider their health care systems, support for child care and for education.  That sense of responsibility runs deeply and is one that has not existed in America, save perhaps the brief years of Franklin Roosevelt.  Even his efforts would be whittled away as the ""Party of Lincoln"" makes sure that America, unlike the countries represented in this marvelous video, never becomes a ""nanny state."""
2020-07-27 13:13:41,"We Americans have become so accustomed to trump's lies and boasting and the disaster that has been the U.S. response that we tune into late night TV to laugh it off or have mask mandate meltdowns. These young folks around the world, learning these facts for the first time, remind us of the appropriate response: disbelief, outrage, tears."

2020-07-27 13:19:12,"The UK furlough scheme,  mentioned in the video,  is not unemployment benefit. People who are furloughed keep their jobs, and receive 80% of their salary (paid by the government until October) while staying at home on lockdown. We have a separate unemployment system, which admittedly has its own (multiple) problems. The UK has not handled this pandemic well on the whole, but one thing is has done pretty well is the support to both employed and self-employed individuals and to small businesses."
2020-07-27 13:19:55,"The US is not united around its People. It is united around old strategies used in bare knuckles politicking that have kept racists and misogynists in power at terrible cost to our People and our Land for centuries. I know, I know, the narrative told in US history books claims we are the best of the best of the best, but the destroyed lives approaching billions over the last four centuries tells another story.  In many ways, countries with more homogenous folk and histories have a different problem to solve with respect to pandemic response. Their problems are adequate healthcare and job infrastructures. They are solving those problems. Ours is trying to find a reason to take care of all of us when many of us want to harm anyone who doesn't have white skin and you know how many of us feel about women (thanks to AOC for not putting up with that). This is our opportunity to grow and become the best we can be. Many of us are working in that direction. I wish us all luck and good will."
2020-07-27 13:20:03,"You don't have to go across the Atlantic to hear many similar responses. Just cross the border to the North, and come to Canada.  The main difference is that unlike many Europeans, we understand all too well what American influence and exceptionalism means on a daily basis. Well, hourly in some instances: all those of us  living near the border (which is most of us) have had to do for decades is turn on our radios.  When we do that, we hear the blare of a vast, self absorbed internal empire trying very hard to convince itself that it is the best at everything, or would be if could just turn back the clock about a century.  Its not a recipe for success in precarious times like these."
2020-07-27 13:23:02,"It'll Be Like Starting Over
Ever wished for things to go back to normal,
Altho' routine has changed since our beginning.
Ever wanted all your feelings rolled up in a ball,
It's good when you feel that you're winning.

Alive in a community we learn more every day,
Logically speaking we should never go backwards.
Today we're less rigid, there seems an alternative way,
No bed of roses as we spiral onwards and upwards.

A friendly embrace should leave you safe and secure,
Greeting with a hug, a handshake more for business deals.
Some call it a close-and-personal grand tour,
It's merely personal choice for how one or t'other feels.

It's wonderful when you're out and about,
And you're acknowledged by familiar faces.
Could be at a restaurant or a bar-- it's your shout,
Such friendly faces in so many places.

Did the greengrocer remember what I ordered this week,
Sweet carrots, peas, beans and broccoli.
Even added some extra brussel sprouts, turnips and a leek,
He knows I'm reluctant to live alone in a shanty.

Today is the day we must begin making changes,
Whether distress of a global threat or not.
The tunnel is narrowing with a lessening chances,
Citizens rise up, let's do it and re-write of the lot!

2020-07-27 13:30:33,The problem in America is not the pandemic.  It's the trump administration.  Lacking clarity about that makes one part of the problem.
2020-07-27 13:33:42,"One thing for sure, considering the millions of Americans who are skeptical of science and more concerned about their ""alleged"" constitutional rights, in today's America if one wants a pandemic to take hold and stay around for awhile,  America is the place to be.  

A pretty sad commentary on a nation that keeps touting itself as exceptional and the ""alleged"" leader of the ""free world"".  In my view, a nation that is moving forward and largely confident in their institutions and their future does not have to constantly keep reminding themselves(and everyone else)how exceptional they are.  If they do, clearly, something is seriously wrong."
2020-07-27 13:37:21,"My first thought was, Why are these people shocked about the number of unemployed and the number of deaths in the United States? Don’t they keep up with the news? 

Regardless, their reactions seemed sincere and genuine. It IS shocking how badly the Trump administration and much of the U.S. have responded to the pandemic. As the gentleman from Senegal notes, we are like a 3rd world country. What an indictment of U.S. “leadership.” 

What Trump has done is (or should be) criminal. Hopefully he will spend the rest of his days in jail after he loses in November. No phone, no tweeting, and no presidential library!"
2020-07-27 13:38:19,This is the reality of the US.People refuse to wear a mask and stay home away from other people.The police and health department refuse to enforce the orders placed by the Governor.This situation is not going to get better.We should get a payment from the Government every month like other Countries.
2020-07-27 13:44:02,"As an informed citizen I saw the pandemic coming, but not in my wildest nightmare could I have thought that it would have been handled so disastrously.
I had read the CDC had faulty tests back in January, nothing was done to correct the problem or to have a National plan to instruct all laboratories to be “testing ready” for the worst.
No PPE disaster storage, hospital alert, mask mandate, social distancing etc was ever in the plans of this inept administration.
We see now the results, so many casualties, an economy on the verge of disaster. Millions of Americans losing their already precarious health insurance.
In the meanwhile Europe and its countries that were hit the most are cautiously reopening to normal life, but continue scrupulously testing, tracing and eventually quarantine .
As an elderly I have been in lockdown since March and in Florida in just a month the number of infections has escalated from 30.000 to 420.000 cases ! 
This president, who bragged about making America first , is making America LAST in the world."
2020-07-27 13:45:46,"In other words, the same challenge has different outcomes in different countries.

That comparison involves a number of factors, like health care systems, the general age and health of the groups, their education and understanding of the situation, and their leadership.     

The fact that the US is performing well below expectations is not just an indictment of Trump, but the country, it's people, and what they accept as proper healthcare.   I hope some learn something from this lesson other than just China is to blame for everything wrong with America."
2020-07-27 13:47:48,"I've wondered out loud if any economist has thought of the economic implications of a just and compassionate society.  It seems that we will all be very productive because we can concentrate on the job at hand with very little worry of what is going to happen to us or our families in case we get sick and unable to work, etc.   Living in such a society will enable us to respond well to extreme conditions such as a pandemic
Of course, there will be those gaming the system, but we have them now anyway."
2020-07-27 13:48:11,"We really made America great again, didn’t we? I used to teach university students about the deteriorating state of the US health system, and how when we compared mortality rates to other countries we looked more like a developing country rather than a world leader. Slowly the students understood that we had a disaster waiting to happen. But I never imagined that our administration and the CDC would react so poorly to this crisis. The people in the video have reacted with compassion but also incredulity.  It is criminal. Beyond belief."
2020-07-27 13:58:10,"How can we get this video to be seen by everyone! I know Trump and his supporters will deny it as fake news, but we should at least try! Play it in New York's Time Square, play it on all the comedian shows. Imagine what the world will think about the U.S. if Trump gets re-elected! What craziness has taken over our country when millions can rationalize personal civil liberties such as TEMPORARY mask mandates over loss of life when it does not need to be this way?"
2020-07-27 13:58:35,"As a Canadian, I’m baffled by the American resistance to free health care. Your system costs far more than ours to run and provides inadequate health coverage for most of your citizens. This failure to modernize health services is one part of the problem, along with poor leadership in the White House. I’m also baffled by the way many Americans equate better social benefits with communism or socialism. Good social benefits are an investment in a country’s citizens and result in more economic prosperity. Once upon a time America’s ideas impressed the world. Increasingly now it is looking like a backward nation that can’t solve its problems. This spring Canada flattened it’s covid 19 curve and supplements 75 % of income for its workers. Our success is never mentioned in US media round ups. Is it too embarrassing for the American media to admit?"
2020-07-27 13:59:45,"It's the culture that is to blame in the U.S. as well as other factors.  We have a notion of ""rugged individualism"" rather than the common good.  As an example I saw an interview with a man who said he was not going to wear a mask just to make other people ""comfortable""."
2020-07-27 14:02:02,"There's no question America's response to the Coronavirus has been terrible. Particularly now when our country hasn't been able to properly flatten the curve like other countries. But I'm a bit concerned this video presents a version of America by leaving out facts. For example in regard to the stimulus check, the video implies that one time payment of $1200 is the only form of economic support given to unemployed people and ignores (albeit flawed) support systems like enhanced unemployment and PPP. The mass graves also seem to imply the US has the highest per capita death count, which isn't true (at least at the moment). I hate to say it but this video kind of feels a more millennial targeted Buzzfeed-esque video than a well thought out NYTimes opinion video."
2020-07-27 14:03:13,"There's a very simple answer to why the US failed to respond to Covid but the rest of the world did: The US government at all levels - federal, state, city - serves corporations and the rich. And the US corporate-owned media largely ignores this dysfunction. 

Only a very few select legislators in this country are funded directly by the American public and hence prioritize the interests and concerns of the American public. Most are funded by, and answerable to, business interests and the agenda of the rich. That's both Trump and Biden, the RNC and the DNC, Pelosi and McCarthy, Schumer and McDonnell. They are all the same.  Beneath the surface. 

Rich Americans aren't suffering in this pandemic. They escaped to their country estates or yachts, their large businesses got large infusions of cash, much of it intended for smaller more vulnerable businesses, they can sit this period out. They have access to testing, and in time they will be front of the line for vaccines. Some of the richest multi-billionaires have gotten exponentially richer, like Bezos. 

If Americans want a country that can respond effectively to public crises, they need to wake up and build it. Like the rest of the world did. But they don't. They are happy to be distracted by deliberate partisan siloing by the media, FNC and CNN, and be at each other's throats instead of manning the barricades and fighting the powers."
2020-07-27 14:03:35,"The US should be honest about why it has been economically so successful: its size. The scale has always provided a competitive benefit for the US. Immigration is driving economic growth as well.

The cynicism of the large parts of the US population and American dream of 'work hard, get rich', were not built on the extraordinary character of the US people, but on consolidation of corporations and scale of the US market. 

US people have also shown its ability to embrace and adopt change in a fast pace, and that needs to happen again. And it seems that the first step is happening right now. 

So, on to
Control over the pandemic
Oust T
People of all color to be treated equal (not just in law but in practice as well)
Public free / low cost education
Public free / low cost healthcare
Fix liability culture

Done."
2020-07-27 14:04:10,"The woman at the end shows that what we are lacking the most is empathy.  If we care more about the other people's well being, our behavior will be different. Yes, young and healthy people will be mostly fine even after getting the virus. We're all tired and exhausted after being cooped, but empathy toward those who're not, can change the behavior. Then it can change the policy. 

Current administration is incompetent and awful, but not the root cause. They're one of the symptoms from what our society has become. We have gradually become a dangerously selfish ""I do what I want, no matter how it affects the others"" society."
2020-07-27 14:06:18,"I am a Canadian and I found the love of my life in the United States, a country I am very fond of. Yet I am consistently dismayed that a nation that is so rich and resourceful is so paralyzed by ideology that it cannot take care of its own. The richest and most powerful country in the world is eminently capable of doing this, but only if its people want it. This isn't about the presidency. Elected judges who reveal their opinions; unrestricted political financing; politicized redistricting and voting processes; paltry and uneven funding of education; and of course the lack of a universal health care system are just some of the problems that might be difficult to solve, but the rest of us developed countries have done that with less wealth and power.

My fear, dear neighbours, is that you have become so polarized, so adverse to facts, that it is already too late."
2020-07-27 14:07:58,"We’re the laughingstock of the developed world, and don’t blame it all on Trump. Democratic governors also reopened way too early.

COVID has exposed long-standing failures of both parties regarding health care, housing, education and industrial policies. 

We are a failed state, desperately in need of new leadership. But the establishment of both parties, demonstrating their level of insanity, pretty much want to stay the course.￼"
2020-07-27 14:10:00,"Thank you for sharing a video with the different perspectives of young people from around the world. It helps us in the U.S.A. with our perspective-
Those of us who think that this is as bad as things can get and then it gets even worse by the day- not only the pandemic but now, capital punishment and the paramilitary forces on our streets- Yes, it can get worse- and it's hearing voices like these that help us know- we aren't losing our minds- this is really happening and it's happening to us because of a out of touch quasi dictator/ strongman."
2020-07-27 14:11:00,"I will say as ridiculous as the US looks now.....I do believe in the end, Trump will have accidentally led you down the right path.

In Australia we went from almost complete suppression of the disease, down to say 10 new cases a day a month ago. Now we are back up to 500 a day. 

What is there is no effective vaccine?
What if you suppress and suppress and it never goes away?
What then?

Then, we have to get used to a new reality. People may die earlier in life and immune deficient people need to take precautions. But the rest of society gets on with living as best it can. For the sake of our children. But how long will it take before we come to accept the new reality?

Because let's be clear, if there is no effective vaccine - which is incredibly possible because I understand it willl take 100 trials to produce even 1 vaccine that comes close to effectiveness if at all - embracing a new morbidity rate for human kind will be what we HAVE to do."
2020-07-27 14:11:29,"The countries with the most successful responses to COVID19 are those that have ditched political ideologies for serious, pragmatic plans. Are you listening America?"
2020-07-27 14:12:35,"This is a country where the majority of its leaders, including its Supreme Court, rule and accept that it's more important for citizens to possess military assault weapons than to prevent the slaughter of 28 six year olds and their teachers, and that it's more important for multi-millionaires and billionaires to take more and more money out of the economy than to pay living wages to and provide good healthcare for the average citizen. Those two things and limiting the rights of women and people of color seem to be the essence of America in the 21st Century so far."
2020-07-27 14:13:06,"Thanks for this -- but the very slow start was annoying.  Finally got started (by which I mean any information actually shared) after an entire minute, and was a good video. But I will be less likely to click on future videos knowing how long I need to wait before it has any information -- just people sighing was not helpful to me. How about informative videos on what other countries are doing and how the citizens feel about it?"
2020-07-27 14:20:32,"If you remember that money is the only thing that matters to republicans and realize that all the losses (real losses not the fake ""what I could have earned if only"" stuff the republicans always cite) that loss goes in to the plus column for some banker and other moneyed interests not unlike how the housing bust was so lucrative for so many. 
You might finally see exactly how intentional all this ""failing"" was."
2020-07-27 14:22:33,"The data says it all. Ten or 11 Southeast Asian nations with a combined population of 400 million suffered 150 deaths and are reopening. Our country, with a population of 330 million, has suffered nearly 150,000 deaths and rising, while our schools are closed and the economy is tanking. As the Economist pointed out, presidential leadership is expected ""to add coherence and clarity"" to a pandemic response. In Trump's case, it has made things worse."
2020-07-27 14:27:56,"While the overall reaction -- incredulity and shock -- of the people in the video is certainly correct, I would take issue with many of the expressions of surprise they exhibit.  We have spent a great deal of time in Europe, particularly France, most recently the past six months during the pandemic, and Europeans are not ignorant of what is going on here.  Most of them read the news from multiple sources, and they know more about world news than Americans.  But in particular, they read and watch American media outlets and they are acutely aware of the dysfunction in the United States.  The point that Mr. Miller and Mr. Westbrook make in the video, that the US is a ridiculous outlier in the world, could be made far more effectively by showing the astuteness of young people around the world.  In education as well as healthcare, we are a third-world country."
2020-07-27 14:28:37,Every American needs to watch this. Especially the last minute.
2020-07-27 14:31:10,Seeing their reactions makes me realize how much horror we've come to accept in the past few years.
2020-07-27 11:28:21,"I'm just curious why so many American news media outlets ignore what is happening in Canada?  We are the mirror image of the United States and provide the best comparison.  Currently our population is just shy of 38,000,000.  We have had over 114,000 confirmed cases, just over 99,000 people have recovered, with 8,800 deaths.  Our government has made sure that we could get tested, had money, people were not thrown out of our homes, and no lineups at food banks.  We are quite happy that the border is closed (and no one wants it opened any time soon), and we are slowly reopening (but if anything spikes it will be closed down again).  I will happily wear a mask (even in my own apartment building), and I thank God that I live in Canada."
2020-07-27 12:01:28,"What is sad and getting sadder is how this is related to division and racism here. We are actually a country where a significant part of the population has no sense of shared experience or responsibility or future. They don’t care about the contagion or the death. Sometimes of even their own family members. That is how toxic the information machine has become. For all that is happening in Texas and Florida they are not learning or changing. They think they are getting the ‘white’ deal and this is brown people and immigrants problem. They don’t care how many get sick or die, they just want that piece of meat to to get on their plate."
2020-07-27 12:26:38,"Once again the NYT gets on its America-bashing bandwagon. How many times must we hear how horrible, how terrible, how racist, how flawed, how decrepit our country is. Covid is a complex phenomenon. We are not a small nation, we are not an island nation, and we are not an authoritarian nation. It’s hard to compare Denmark, New Zealand, or South Korea to us. We are very geographically and culturally diverse. We also happens to have a massive protest movement simultaneously. Yes our leadership has failed us miserably, and many mistakes have been made by politicians of both parties, but let’s please stop with the tired trope of “the embarrassed American.” It’s getting old."
2020-07-27 13:04:08,"The guy in the video was right, it is not funny!"
2020-07-27 14:07:54,"Let the self flagellation begin. I, for one, don’t care what the world thinks of us. Articles like these seem to appear with regularity in the NYT. There has always been anti-Americanism in many parts of the world-some deserved some not. Lately much of it is tainted with the stench of schadenfreude. I’m not defending the current state of our country but I don’t see how wallowing in this negative space contributes anything in helping us to move forward."
2020-07-27 10:52:11,It is tragic to see what has happened to our country..truly tragic. Our hubris and arrogance (USA! USA! USA!) sicken me. It is long past time for a Constitutional Convention to reset our broken operating system.  The pressure of pandemic has revealed the deep social and economic injustice of our failing American experiment.  I am not hopeful..as we have not hit rock bottom yet. We are only in denial..
2020-07-27 11:42:11,"Not knowing that 2+2= 4 is ignorance. A universal human condition that can be cured by curiosity.

Knowing that 2+2= 5 is stupidity.  That is a less common but terminal condition.

Being willing to accept looking ridiculous aka ignorant by saying ' I don't know' is a humble humane empathetic wise path. But it is not easy.

Nor is the ability to think creatively, independently and originally when facing a public problem."
2020-07-27 12:06:34,"Leaders and parties in power around the world have mostly done much, much better reacting to, organizing for, and dealing with, and producing reagents and everything else in the supply chain needed to fight a modern pandemic.

trump did nothing.

He offloaded to 50 states, the imbecile.

He campaigned and glorified himself.

The result is almost 150,000 known covid deaths in the US.  And surely higher when a proper accounting is done in the future.

2020-07-27 12:49:55,"The countries that have staved-off the worst of the virus followed medical advice and common sense. America followed Trump, who supplied neither. In fact, he supplied the exact opposite to common sense because he lives in his own fantasy world and forced Americans too as well. Fantasy is fine for kids, but doesn't do much for any adult with a tube down your throat and knowing a $50,000 medical bill will bankrupt you.

Other countries have a right to be stunned by America's lunatic response. All of America should be too - even the less educated  can surely see what is going on by now."
2020-07-27 12:13:18,"Elephant in the room, please!  All of those countries have some form of a functioning national healthcare system.  The US does not.  This issue should be a slam dunk here—it crosses racial lines and we’re in a pandemic we here people (mostly of color) are losing health insurance.  Sorry—but the real insult is that even in these times we are stuck the big ugly in the White House or Biden who...wants to lower Medicare by 5 years.  I could see all those youths crying or laughing over Biden policies."

And it's not that other countries don't have their troubles. They do. We are at the height of a government who no longer cares about us. Protests will continue. We are fed up and well should be."
2020-07-27 13:28:07,"“We’re number one!” How many times does the US make this baseless claim? The only thing they’re number one in is mishandling of this pandemic. Oh and prison population, and military spending."
2020-07-27 13:58:05,"Trump has completely humiliated our great country. Seeing how the people of the world react to what happened in the US, it is heart-broken.  We must not have another four years of Trump. Otherwise we will end up in the ditch, the bottom of it."
2020-07-27 10:43:48,"Watching this video made me squirm.  The tears of the young Asian woman made me cringe.

I guess after the fire we'll just make up the guest bedroom and try to put up as many guests as we can."
2020-07-27 13:23:07,"Of course  our response under Trump to this major crisis has been laughable. A bitter joke. For a long time our president was in denial that any crisis at all existed----""sniffles"",  ""another flu"", "" it will soon pass.""  
It becomes apparent that our president does not ask himself the questions he should be asking and should be striving to answer.  He should be asking:  What should we do to preserve the most  lives and guard the health of the most Americans?  That should be uppermost.  And  then : How can we enable the most people in this nation survive economically: pay their bills, feed their families, and keep their homes.  These should be the major concerns.  They are not.
Firstly and foremost, Trump asks: What should I do to be reelected?  How make myself look better?   And then comes the second question: What should I do to make the Democrats look bad---make them look frightening; anarchists, lawbreakers,. the  group that removes  police protection.   His focus is on getting reelected, staying in power and keeping his emoluments. It is not on saving our lives.  Laughable."

England just pulled the rug out from its citizens (including the transportation secretary himself!) vacationing in Spain, with essentially no notice. 

There's no news here. There's nothing unexpected. If we let up 
strict quarantine on the hardest hit demographics, we can expect a rise in cases. I would expect an exponential rise in those demographics, and a linear rise in other demographics.
Then the hardest hit demos will rapidly fall as tracing stops the spread due to one superspreader. 

At least were we can tell what's happening, like in my county,
that's exactly what happened! You can't see it in the NYTimes, it needs too detailed statistics, but locally it is well publicised. 

Unless people are incapable of logic, which apparently NYTimes readers are, its clear that the Times's saying that the US is worse than Europe is silly.  Pretty soon out big coastal cities will be seeing bigger rises. They were just tamped down more in the worst demographics than places like S. Texas.

Oh yes ... what happened to the praise in the NYTines for Australia? That they had it conquered. Tell that to the people locked down in Melbourne.  Also Singapore, Hong Kong. 

If its in the NYTimes, we expect that it is so politically motivated that it can't be trusted. How the respected have fallen!"

Even foreigners like when I was there.  We are the ONLY country that has literally brainwashed its citizens into thinking we shouldn’t have listened to Bernie on this one.  This is the only truly barbaric country I’ve visited or lived in that uses sick people as sources of profit, and makes us feel like there’s no other way.  We are a third world country that the rest of the world feels sorry for. And have been - for maybe decades.  
I paid $25,000 in tax for healthcare and an additional $668/month, but because nothing is ‘covered’, another for $362 to $700 for every doctor visit, on $60,000 total annual income. Anthem is charging me $4,000 to be tested for COVID-19, saying I should have gone to an Urgent Care center. My son-in-law, an MDPhD, guiding me on what to do, they called ahead to the hospital, etcetera. I did first go to Urgent Care. A friend masked up and took me.  They wouldn’t let me in because I was too sick. 

In this country, they don’t care if you die. That’s literally how it feels. 

In ANY other country, I (have) would have received superior care (for free) and felt like the system was trying to heal me, it feels like your life is valued. Here, it feels like your life is to extract money from, and after that, it doesn’t matter if you die.   

It is literally INSANE here. #M4A"

You might say were a first rate police state, but they are a bunch of lunatics that relish bearing arms and playing cops and robbers.

The healthy approach is in America is don't trust anyone, not the doctors, not the politicians, not the engineers, not the media. Trust yourself and you mostly come out ahead.

I'd say it's more than ridiculous because this was happening in the United States, while this country is going to launch during these very days the most sophisticated probe - Perseverance - to Mars!

Is then science now ridiculed by a big chunk of Americans,  replaced by the Evangelicals blessing to them? As the case of Bolsonaro's Brazil?

In Italy I was confident that the unruly ""nature-indipendent"" Italians would respond well to the invitation of  Mr. Giuseppe Conte’s government to wear masks, after they were available ""en masse"".

And my optimism was stemming from a previous behavior, in 2003, when the Ministry of Health – Girolamo Sirchia – succedeed in implementing ban on smoking, in public areas or inside public buildings. 

The Italians immediately obeyed, since they had understood that it was a matter of health, and they did not care if the law had been conceived under the then bizarre Berlusconi's government.

Therefore, when Covid-19 struck Italian lifes, they perceived that it was very, very lethal, and everyone wore masks and rigorously applied social distances. 

Healthcare is neither Republican nor Democratic: it is just health. Your health: was it so difficult to understand?

I'm asking myself though when people start going onto the streets to fight against the lies, the denial and all that is so, so wrong about how this administration handles the crisis - it actually makes the crisis, not the virus does. Hopefully enough people at least understand that and keep it in mind when they vote."

Why didn't we do the simple measures that almost every other country implemented to control Covid? Who is responsible for over 146,000 Americans dying while gasping for their last breath? Trump is so clearly incompetent that you can't put all the blame on him. You could blame Fox and US crazies for misinformation. You could blame governors who STILL won't mandate masks even while their states burn. You could blame ourselves for installing leadership based on lies. 

Or you could blame John Bolton and Mitch McConnell. If either of them had woken up one day in 2019 and said, ""I'm going to be a patriot"", then Pence would have been president in 2020. Pence, like Trump, is also overmatched by Covid, but he has shown in the past that he would eventually have let health officials do the right things. Think about it.

Perhaps it is tragedy that ‘concentrates the mind wonderfully’ in determining what life is to be lived for. The world outside the US has appeared to understand it better than the US who still lives in a past defined by Cold War materialism The US may have won it but inside itself it can be perceived as a rusted out shell where a dream has become the great nightmare. 

America under a defunct and abject leadership has failed a great  test of the early 21st. Big time. The ignorance , foolishness and hearty stupidity of a wasted and tired American provincialism has had free reign in its society for too long. America is caught in a decrepit bubble of its own making.

This powerful video is simultaneously uplifting and miserably depressing. Uplifting because these young people — interesting that the Times chose only young people to feature — show that the world, if not the vaunted ""USA! USA!"", has a bright future in front of it.

But given that Trump believes (or believed) in a president's responsibility for what happens on his (sigh) watch, the video is also a scathing, grievous indictment of none other than ... Donald J. Trump. 

I don't know what's become of Michael Bloomberg's promise of billions to fight Trump at the ballot box, but here's hoping he, or someone else, makes incisive use of this disaster in advertising.

It will just ""disappear,"" he said, and still says! 

Trump and his mouthpieces blame China and suggest this was a deliberate thing, to which I say, so? It doesn't matter whether an attack on this country is deliberate or inadvertent, it's still his job to be on high alert to threats and work to keep us safe.

Somehow the woke elite believed the virus won’t affect the protesters. Google how the flu of 1918 was brought back and killed thousands,  due to OUTDOOR parades in Philadelphia. It’s not surprising to see a second wave right now after we had millions protesting in the streets.

A) USA is a poor country with some rich people, given much is out of reach without wealth or employer benefits.
In advanced countries health, education (including investing in early childhood) is taken as a public good and is subsidised.

B) USA is a failed state:
• rule of law has broken down
• democracy has been shredded
• elites get away with whatever they like
• states aren’t able to provide basics for people
• life becomes a brutal battle for self-preservation, and norms change: to ones of cruelty, brutality, even hate and violence.

It is tragic that the focus of politics is about having power, rather than meeting the needs of all the population.  It seems Washington doesn't care about the suffering of the ordinary people.

The Christian Gospel puts particular emphasis on caring for the needy - eg the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, imprisoned.  (And while there is a call to personal moral conduct, it is Pharisaical to enforce morality on others.)  I don't see political leadership based on the Gospel.

He could have directed government interventions into the supply chains of PPE for our medical professionals.  He did nothing but argue that the pandemic would just go away, and appointed his son in law to dispense tax dollars to private ""contractors"".  He spent months promoting false ""cures"" and miraculous recovery.

China was ground zero for the disease, stumbled out of the blocks but soon served as the example followed for effective policies for preventing covid spread around the world. Of course, these were policies that were initially described as over the top and draconian and then simply mostly not covered in US media. Instead we saw with approving nods all the coverage of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong's successes dealing with covid and the policies employed which all basically mirrored those of the country that cannot be mentioned when discussing containing covid success stories. But... If you really want to embarrass Trump and Pompeo -- just tell the truth. China has done a far better job and beyond that is playing a key role in aiding other countries with aid and equipment as it continues to open up. and it is pretty much back to the ""new normal"" 
All which could lead one to conclude if Trump and Pompeo truly think China presents such an ""existential"" threat then maybe they both should step aside and let some adults who know what they are doing start running the country. Because. You know. Where are we now?"

Today coincidentally, a post praising our president appeared on my LinkedIn feed. God was brought into the conversation and the comments section exploded.
Very depressing and sometimes scary to read a comment equating god and invoking god’s will as it relates to Mr. T expressed by supposedly professional businesspeople. Very disturbing.

Your video series nailed it we are in deep deep trouble."
2020-07-27 11:01:09,"I just watched more tears shed over the incalculable American loss of life in this video than I have from anyone in the Trump administration. How sad.

As an American who has since permanently left the country for a better life, I am not as shaken by these facts - America's callous disregard for life – really, for anything that is not money – is not new to me. But for many looking at the US from abroad, I think some of their ideas about our nation are being shattered. For all the US' problems, it was still seen as a relatively stable, prosperous country by many abroad. While Trump and his crooked administration have accelerated the decline of that idea's validity, its response to the coronavirus is has cemented it."

The worst part is that at no moment does Trump express sorrow or compassion."
2020-07-27 13:11:04,"I was in Miami, my husband in the Caribbean, my daughter in Ireland. Ireland, she could only travel within 2 km of where she lived, only shops open were supermarkets and pharmacies. Govt paid 70% of peoples salaries, so people could pay rent, buy food. No worries about trying to get unemployment assistance. Lockdown for about 3 months, slow opening. Caribbean, the island locked down hard for 8 weeks, ie you were in your home 24/7 Wed and Sunday, allowed out to shop other days. No beach access, no boating, excercise between 7.30am and 9am or 5.30pm to 7pm. Curfew 8pm-5am. If stopped on the road by Police, show your supermarket receipt or get fined. No international travel in or out of the country. Miami was actually pretty good, masks in supermarket or Home Depot, initially very little travel, curfew 10pm-5am. This only lasted about 3  weeks. Then construction started up again, people could drive around in their cars (hence huge q's at food banks etc). By 8 weeks if beaches in Miami were still locked down- Just drive to Ft Lauderdale and join the couple of thousand people on the beach there."

1) The UK, Spain, France, Italy, and Belgium, have 80 million less people combined than the US, but same number of deaths. The US doesn't lead the world in death except when you ignore it's the third largest country in the world. Compare like population sizes or deaths per million would give an honest look.
2) The states and local government have the main responsibility for controlling the epidemic. The largest states like California, Texas, New York and Florida, have country sized populations, GDP, and resources. They are in charge of things like shutdowns, contact tracing, testing centers, food banks, nursing homes, and unemployment benefits. 
3) The Democratic controlled states like New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have the worst records of any state, far exceeding any southern or Republican run state, including deaths per million three times that of all other states.
4) The media's focus on Trump, and giving Democratic governors a free pass (New York, New Jersey, California) imperils the public by keeping the misinformed.
5) Germany and Japan's success relied on state and local government. This paper outlined German states and mayor of Tokyo leading.
6) The CDC and FDA Feb bungling of tests and PPE shortage was not Trump's fault.
7) New York state and city seem content to wait for a vaccine, just like Trump. 
8) NY state doesn't report probable deaths, the city does.

We’ve carefully curated an image of independence that fits into a the old pioneer’s narrative that today only helps businesses and a certain stripe of politicians fueled by low information voters.  This well accepted and false belief that if you are not successful, you’re just not working hard enough, and more over, you’re probably just lazy.

Italy was hit a lot worse than Texas and it seems people there are still worried about it and staying close to home. It's not the same as it was. We are not well as well behaved?

But is the pandemic under control? This time around, Texans isn't as anxious about getting out. If people went back to normal like it was last year is Covid-19 going to start to take lives like it did last spring? Is it really possible to reopen?

I was at Costco and you could get a box of 50 masks for around $20. That's money some people don't have.  How are the Italians getting their masks? Are they free? I'd appreciate the Australian and Canadian response. They know things.

Put this partisan bent aside and what you hear over and over again is that while the United States has handled the pandemic abysmally to date on a host of fronts, so have most other first world nations, typically with much smaller populations.  Even in countries with socialized medicine,  if you press people for reality on the ground, you hear much the same refrains:  woefully unprepared even though we had adequate advance notice and resources, not enough testing capability and its taking too long to get results, etc."

Two thoughts:

First, it's encouraging to see that the young people from other countries - with the perspective of how their governments have performed in dealing with covid-19 - understand how horribly Trump's administration has bungled the handling of this pandemic.

Second, when that young girl was brought to tears thinking of all the Americans who have died from the pandemic I was  similarly brought to tears, and reminded of Trump and the Republican's callous disregard for those same Americans.  Their whole objective has been to deny and deflect the severity of this pandemic - just to reopen the economy ASAP so they can be reelected."
2020-07-27 14:37:23,"The odd part of the US, and the UK, response to COVID 19, is the emphasis on the vaccine and the lack of interest in treatment. Treatment is limited to only drugs that were developed for different use. Big pharma has an economic reason in that treatment could be a one-time event while vaccines mean recurring revenues.  NIH with a $40 billion annual budget, has no excuse. 
Another odd part is the lack of interest in clean air devices, ionizers, and/or UVC, despite numerous peer-viewed papers that show abatement of various airborne viruses with these devices.
A Stanger in a Strange Land might think governments are trying to cull the costly elderly."

We were worried about the direction our country was taking, and it seemed the safest thing to do. At the beginning, I was mortified and embarrassed to admit I was American. After we'd been here a few months, it seemed more comical than anything else. Now pain and grief are my dominant feelings. We love our country deeply, and it's wrenching to watch people with the power to rescue it sit on their hands. And yet, there is hope -- in the people fighting for Black Lives Matter, for respect and recognition to Native Americans, to protect the environment and slow down (and reverse, if possible) climate change, for the kind of deep structural socio-economic changes that must occur for there to be real equality.  It's within reach, but only if people vote. We'll be voting from our home here in Amsterdam."

As the cases continue to grow in. nearby Reno, I am actually scared to death to go there except to stores like Costco and Walmart that enforce a mask policy. 

On Thursday, I picked up a long awaited 2021 GMC pickup truck, a symbol of rural living.  I hope to live long enough to enjoy it."
2020-07-27 14:51:37,"There are several possible approaches to dealing with the pandemic.

1. Lock down immediately to control the spread of the virus; then open up only after the spread is under control.

2. The Sweden model: do nothing beyond an attempt to protect the most vulnerable.

3. Some hybrid of the first two.

The first, applied by China, South Korea and much of Europe, appears to be the most successful.

The second was an effort to minimize the economic impact, and apparently failed at either protecting the economy or protecting the public.

The U.S. attempted the third: most states started a lock down to protect the public from the worst of the pandemic, but then many states, particularly those with Republican Governors, opened up before the pandemic was under control.  With a patchwork of approaches across the 50 states, and no attempt to control the movement of people across state borders, we have essentially chosen the worst combination of the two main approaches.

It looks to me that our haphazard approach will prolong both the economic impact and the health impact of the pandemic."

In stark contrast, we've been in various stages of lockdown since February as has our host country. Our combined contact tracing has been proactive and thorough, enabling us to crush outbreaks of the virus with near precision and providing us a reassuring feeling of protection. The mitigating measures put into effect have been so comprehensive and coordinated that all but a tiny percentage of parents are ready to send their kids back to school. All of it can be attributed to a strong sense of community spirit, the alliance, and a shared culture of sacrifice which has been sorely missing from far too many of our fellow citizens back in the States during this pandemic."

This is so embarrassing."

I went to England on a tour two years ago and was so embarrassed by the administration’s actions that I felt I had to tell everyone I encountered that I had not voted for Trump and was wholeheartedly opposed to his policies. This administration’s confused and disorganized response to the pandemic is just another example of its total disregard for the well being of Americans. Where will it end?
2020-07-27 15:08:06,"Very powerful. I knew pretty much about the number of cases and deaths, but the line up for the food bank is shocking; nor did I know that other countries were handling the joblessness so much better. It's really a stamp of a deranged president, government administration and Republican Party. But there is also a pandemic of derangement, as so many Americans flaunt their ""right"" not to wear a mask or do social distancing. It appears that the Trump administration and Republican Congress, in tandem with the Internet spread of misinformation, have incited conspiracy theories, resistance to facts, and an inflammatory sense of entitlement. The dangerousness of this cocktail is food bank lines and mass graves on one hand, but armed militia on the other, and Portland federal agents, which all constitutes a shocking instability — the result of everyone who could have done something to remove Trump but didn't. And the anti-mask, anti-social distancing protests are spreading to British Columbia. It turns out that the indulgence of selfishness is as contagious as Covid-19 and we are not immune. Many thanks to the young people who participated in this, and to the NYT."

What does it say about a country, when your average 10-year-old has better sense, compassion, empathy, and understanding of things than the President, the Vice-President, his Administration, his fellow party members in Congress, and roughly 40% of the voting public?

It's says that our country is in such a state of dysfunction that it may be beyond repair. How does one determine when things have gone beyond the point of return?

And they will continue to do so until people decide they are tired of listening and electing self-serving liars - and we have an election system that supports the will of the majority in deciding who goes to the White House.

It is an inescapable fact that the two worst administrations in modern American history were the result of an election system that allowed the loser to declare victory.

Under Bush II, hundred of thousands of innocent Iraqi's were killed, many of them children, in a war of choice with a nation that did absolutely nothing to us. And now, under Trump, hundreds of thousand of people may pay for his personal dysfunction and hubris with their lives.

This is not conjecture. This is not alt-reality. This is reality.

Right now, at this very moment, an American citizen is out of work, going hungry, or taking their last breath as a direct result of the incompetence of Donald Trump and the broken system of elections that allowed him to declare victory after losing the election by three million votes.

This proves it is a lie. 

We are not great. People from around the world do not envy, fear, or hate us; they pity us. They actually weep for Americans, for the nearly 150,000 Americans who have already died, for the mass graves, for the lack of testing, for the lack of basic healthcare, and for the rampant hunger. 

Trump and the GOP do nothing but lie while deliberately refusing to address Covid-19, or any of our dire social issues. If this wasn't enough, Trump and the GOP keep cutting our already pathetic social safety net and seek to destroy the ACA (yet again) even though up to 100 million Americans would lose their medical coverage. 

Trump and the GOP have caused Americans so much needless suffering and death. It does not exist anywhere else in the developed world, and not even in many poor countries.  

None of these people are Americans, yet all genuinely care about us, while too many Americans have proven they don't care how many Americans die, or can't pay their bills, or starve.

While single payer systems in Italy and Spain broke down, we had a mortality rate 2% lower than Canada's with twice as many patients per capita. We never had to ration care.

Most major advances in the management of COVID19 came from American hospitals. The use of Decadron to reduce mortality came from the US and the UK, the use of Remdisivr and its ability to reduce days of hospitalization came from a US NIH study. 

Moderna, a US company, started phase 3 trials involving 30,000 patients in the U.S..  This is the most extensive and promising vaccine trial. Operation WarpSpeed will produce half a billion doses of vaccine by mid-2021 should a vaccine be approved.

Some countries did better than the US in controlling the infection rate using techniques which can't be done here for legal reasons.  For example, Israel accessed people's cell phone data to track contacts. That requires a warrant here.  Many of our problems stem from our specific laws and our freedom of privacy.  Forcing people to wear masks, not attend church, and close their businesses are pending in our courts.

The US has had some major successes. Let's give foreigners a balanced view of our successes and our failures."
2020-07-27 15:23:18,"This quote comes to mind: 
If you can't be a good example, then you'll have to serve as a horrible warning.
The U.S. has demonstrated to the world the human consequences of embracing a value system that benefits corporations and the stock market over the welfare of individuals."
2020-07-27 14:57:18,"I just cannot understand how anyone could support a person like Trump anymore, it is appalling, surely they now can see all the lies he tells.   We have close American friends and we really feel for them, they say the election cannot come quick enough"
2020-07-27 15:00:55,You don't need to look far to get a response on how the U.S. has addressed this problem. I took a Covid test 2 weeks ago. I'm still waiting for the results. Same with 4 other people I know. We are beyond third world status. We are nothing but a broken  embarrassment.
2020-07-27 15:11:53,"I have to tell you, as a non-American living here who can't immediately leave, this is the most depressing stuff ever. I would rather be almost anywhere else in the developed world at this point."
2020-07-27 14:29:19,"A download of the coronavirus data from ""Worldometers"" a day or two ago revealed that the USA is now ""NUMBER ONE""!

We are THE most infectious country in the world measured by per capita Active Cases.

We are also in the top 4% per capita fatality rate.

No wonder the rest of the world locks their borders against us.

This video is pretty much how our friends and family in Australia view America these days.  ""How could that great nation have fallen so far and so fast?”"
2020-07-27 14:37:53,"While I agree that Trump (and some state Governors) deserve a failing grade for Covid response, the NYTimes does itself a disservice with reporting worthy of the book ""How To Lie With Statistics"". The U.S.A. has the world's third-largest population, so the absolute number-counts of infections and deaths are meaningless in evaluating our performance. If you look at Covid infections per capita, Covid deaths per capita, and Covid deaths per Covid infection, the U.S. is not even IN CONTENTION for the top spot in ANY of them. However, given the U.S.A.'s advantages, it is shameful for us to rank even in the top 20, and we do. This real story is bad enough, worse than we should accept from our leaders, so there's no need for you to run the risk of losing credibility by hollering that our lead in the absolute death-count means we are doing worse than any other country at Covid-management, where the real standouts far ahead of us are the U.K. and Belgium."
2020-07-27 15:05:57,"Thank you for the powerful video. 

Pl. stay safe people, trump might not care of you but you must.

-99 days and counting to dismantle trump and his cronies."
2020-07-27 15:24:39,"Thank you for this video. I don’t know how many days I’ve cried since this whole pandemic started but I know people who were impacted so it was personal. I think it says a lot for the compassion and humanity of the people in the video in their shock and alarm for what’s happened in the US. Here, Asian-Americans are getting harassed with racist attacks as they try to blame “others” for the spread of the virus, while a woman in South Korea weeps for our dead. Blame Trump, this is all on him, his greatest achievement in life was the needless deaths of 150,000  Americans and more to come."
2020-07-27 15:27:24,"I like to read the newspaper. I appreciate someone making a video, but as you might imagine, I like to read for myself. Please, let readers know if an op-ed is a video. Thank you."
2020-07-27 15:27:58,"There may be some american citizen, that may not know it better, and maybe (very likely) Trump can not process simple data and his metrics are a bucket of fried chickens.
But everyone in the GOP, all these conservative lawmakers should know better. They should be able to read the statistics, many of these data is really simple, and from different sources they all say basically the same.
How can these senators of Trumps own party not been nauseated by Trumps permanent bragging in the most generic terms, his lack of knowledge of details he reveals basically at any time. ""very stable genius"" - that should make normal people cringe.
The rest of the world is aware of all these, so how can all these politician claim to be patriots, and not get it, that america is in freefall because of their actions and their president."
2020-07-27 15:28:41,"Here in Canada we were all quite impressed that the US was able to keep it together for 1-2 months before tanking like this. This shouldn’t be surprising - as Canadians, we regards our neighbours as people who don’t like being told what to do. It is very sad, but definitely not surprising."
2020-07-27 15:32:13,"In total, more people have died in Europe than the US with relatively similar populations. That means Europe had more cases or a worse medical system? Chose your poison.

If you treat each ""country"" as a US ""state"" (since many in Europe and around the world are not much different from US states in terms of size, you also see widely varying approaches to how to control/manage the pandemic.  

Do we really trust statistics from Vietnam? Remember when Singapore was the poster child, until it wasn't?  The trouble with pandemics is that not having the disease only leaves your population susceptible when the disease finally arrives.  Germs, like people, are unable to ""teleport""; it takes time for them spread from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  

Pay now or pay later.  Massive quarantine can stop transmission, but it keeps the level of vulnerable people high which leads to the so-called ""second wave"" which is really the result of ""successfully"" suppressing the natural spread of the virus.

Keep hoping for a vaccine. Otherwise nothing we do will stop Covid from taking the lives it's going to take. No amount of ""quarantine"" is going to stop it; you can delay the inevitable, but unless you plan to starve your population, you can't quarantine forever."
2020-07-27 15:33:07,America needs more immigrants. We need to strengthen the American dream. Especially seeing well off american born people fleeing to their country side estates overseas. Immigrants always will keep up fighting for the American dream. Only ask my second generation US Marine son. America is worth fighting for and we will not give up or in because of difficulties or the current direction our country is taking. Instead of disappearing overseas find a way to help America to a better place.
2020-07-27 15:48:05,"Watching our Covid numbers and deaths climbing again, I've felt so incredibly numb. But seeing these lovely young people express their horror and sorrow for us made me weep. They showed so much more empathy in that short video than our narcissist leader has during the entire course of this pandemic. Where is the national mourning for 150,000 lives lost?"
2020-07-27 15:48:41,"Now, imagine sharing a border with America right now?

This failure to control the coronavirus in the U.S., (knowing it has been viewed through a political lens from day one), it both shocking and tragic. Our provincial premieres have worked together with our federal leaders to flatten the curve knowing nothing is more important than the health and well-being of all Canadians. 

With cases still rising in the U.S., we fear the re-opening of the U.S./Canada border. We know if the our federal government insists on keeping it closed, Trump will retaliate against us. If Canada even hints at his government’s failure to control this virus we will be in his crosshairs, and economic pain will be inflicted on us. 

We will continue to fight this virus to protect lives, we just hope we don't have to fight Trump too."
2020-07-27 15:49:57,"Some comments from an outsider which I hope won't come across as arrogant. It's not my intention.

America's achievements during the 20th century, especially in the years after the 2nd World War, have been astonishing. It truly is an incredible country. It still is. America's people are incredible. I know. I've been there.

I do think, however, that America's success has bred complacency and - dare I use the word? - arrogance: a sense that its accomplishments are inevitable and not the result of hard work and innovation.

If this pandemic (especially taking place under the leadership of Emperor Mitch McConnell) is to have any silver lining, it will be to restore focus and perspective and a sense of realism to the American people.

This. together with other developments, like the conversations on social social inequality taking place now, will truly make America great again.

It's just a pity that the lessons must be learnt at such a cost and with so much grief."
2020-07-27 15:37:36,"The future looks to be in good hands.  Now, let's vote out ever Republican so that America can be a part of that future."
2020-07-27 15:40:47,"When one person died, it’s a big issue. But when one more died among 150,000 deaths. It’s just an insignificant event. Few cares, especially Donald J. Trump."
2020-07-27 15:41:14,President Trump is wrong. The world is not laughing at the US; the world is feeling sorry for the US.
2020-07-27 15:48:15,"Yeah, but the figures don't actually bear this out, as is often the case with stats about America.  According to the NY Times own stats, France, where I now live, is still worse than the US with 30,000 deaths for a population of a bit more than 60 million.  The UK and Belgium are also worse.  So even though the president's leadership is pathetic, the US isn't yet as bad as European countries whose leaders are sane."
2020-07-27 15:40:43,"This is so sad. Our leaders focus has been the economy, and they have helped destroy it with their half baked tea party (remember them, they’re still around) solutions. So afraid that someone somewhere in the lower or middle classes might take advantage of the situation like the rich have been doing for years!

What is lost in all of this is that no matter what the president of any governor says, the economy is NOT reopening to what it was no matter what. We have crossed the Rubicon. There is no confidence in our country’s leaders.

Life has changed in the US as people’s views have shifted. Going out to dinner, dressing up, socializing, drinking with strangers let alone getting drunk, entertaining, daycare, school, any social activity, even grocery shopping let alone shopping, all has become hazardous because of POOR LEADERSHIP, no leadership from a group of people who are so isolated from life of the regular American. 

Larry Kudlow, one of the head clowns, said it well. “It’s no big deal” about going back to school. Our health, our jobs, our confidence, our families and friends have been stripped away by these monsters and if we vote one of them including Gaetz in Fl back in office again, we are all suckers in a side show."
2020-07-27 15:41:07,"We’re back to where we were during W Bush, but times ten - a colossal embarrassment on the world stage.

We’ve become the crazy, gun-toting, disease-carrying neighbor no one wants.  When it’s Trump ringing the bell, people turn off the lights and pretend they’re not home.

We’re the world’s ONLY developed nation without universal health care, without sensible gun control, without paid parental and sick leave, without a climate change plan - and now, without a COVID-19 strategy.

For someone who grew up in an era when America was seen as a beacon of democracy and world leader on every issue that mattered, this is really, really painful.

Evicting Trump and the GOP will be a good start toward a comeback, but only a start.  Our problems run deep."
2020-07-27 15:42:10,"At some point Americans will have to take responsibility for the  mythology that undergirds their world view—a mythology that is killing them, a mythology which they willingly die for—the mythology that elected Donald Trump. Republicans are the keepers of these anti-social myths—guns, guts and glory. It's time to not only tear down the statues of civil war slave owners, but also those of the founding fathers, whose self-serving wisdom juxtaposed slavery with lofty notions of liberty. Let's rename the Washington monument as long as we're at it. It's well past time to start over. Yes, even the constitution, which, in the end, proved to be no match for a shallow television reality star. All of this pomp has left us with a dire circumstance."
2020-07-27 15:47:53,"“The United States has mass graves...”

Yup.

We also have people who’d rather die of diabetic comas than be forced into bankruptcy by trying to access healthcare.

We also have a military force deployed against our own cities, snatching people off the street in unmarked vehicles and holding them indefinitely without charges or access to legal counsel.

We also have millions of starving children, and families who are trapped with abusive spouses.

We also have 3 generations with close to no retirement savings, or any savings of any kind, because billionaires monopolized the labor market and stomped on wages, benefits, and worker rights for the last 55 years in retaliation for ending segregation.

We also have a populace who is so consumed by social media conspiracies, they’d rather drink bleach than take a vaccine developed by the medical community to protect the populace from the continued effects of the pandemic.

I feel like an alien in my own country. I certainly saw this trajectory as a potential result of the path we were on back in 2000, but never in my wildest fever dream did I ever think the nightmare scenario we are currently faced with would come to pass.

The scariest bit are the millions of people who have rejected scientific fact, and are consumed by YouTube and Facebook conspiracy theories. Whether or not Trump *wins in November, the country is going to be living with those millions of conspiracy nuts for many years to come. And that’s terrifying."
2020-07-27 15:55:47,"The video is well done. Very real and powerful. This should be used by the Biden campaign. So much for a President who kept hollering the whole world is laughing at US, during President Obama's tenure. Now the whole world is pitying US and laughing at him."
2020-07-27 15:56:18,"Just watching these young people’s reactions to what is happening in the US is very sobering. And the amount of compassion shown towards the number of deaths made me cry too. Pres. Trump, as far as I know, has never expressed remorse, compassion, sadness About any of this. But that takes humility, right?"
2020-07-27 15:56:31,"The first video was interesting, but the second one is heartbreaking.  EVERYONE should see it several times. There is a basic lesson about human connections that we have lost, and along with it a dense of dignity and morality."
2020-07-27 15:57:57,"We had candidates in the democratic primary who proposed offering programs that are in place in other countries however the wagons were circled and we were told these things are too radical and misguided because of expense and Americans would not accept socialistic ideas. Indeed, after Sanders won some of the initial primaries there were many op-eds in the NYT and other major papers that made these very points and viewed Sanders as an extremist. While I will vote for Biden to remove Trump, I am aware that Biden is against universal health care, wrote the crime bill, supported the Iraq war, wants to cut social security, medicare, medicaid, food stamps, is the architect of the student debt, wrote a bill that formed the basis of the Patriot Act, is opposed to abortion etc.  My fear is that if he does little or nothing for the people, the path for the election of extreme right wing candidates such as Tom Cotton or Pompeo  will be laid.  He will have to do something for the people to prevent this.  However, at this point he seems to be more interested in serving the rich and powerful and protecting their interests. That's where the money is."
2020-07-27 15:59:01,"At the rate we are deteriorating in every respect in this time of Donald Trump it is not impossible to think that the USA will drop from the ranks of a fully developed nation.  The US no matter how ineptly Trump handles his responsibilities will remain a rich nation, but the life that most of its citizens lead could fall below the common standard of a large number of countries."
2020-07-27 16:01:57,"In America, governors and mayors—not presidents—have authority to issue stay-at-home orders, close businesses, shut down schools and require people to wear masks in public. The United States has more than 200,000 diagnostic and testing laboratories, but only 200 are federal labs, and these are located in just seven states plus Puerto Rico. This is why states and municipalities—not the federal government—are responsible for testing and diagnosis. The United States has thousands of hospitals and medical clinics, but only a tiny percent are federal hospitals, and most of these are Veterans Administration facilities.  This is why state, local and private hospitals—not federal hospitals—are responsive for treating COVID-19 patients.

Americans who think their states or cities were too slow or too quick to shutdown or too quick or too slow reopen should focus their anger on their governors or mayors, not on the president.

Presidents should be judged on how well or how poorly the federal government accomplishes it pandemic-related functions. The CDC develops guidelines to combat epidemics and pandemics. It finances and coordinates the development, production and distribution of vaccines. The Stafford Act authorizes presidents to allocate federal funds to fight pandemics. The Defense Production Act empowers president to manufacture products to fight pandemics. Presidents can also ban travelers from other counties to prevent them from spreading communicable diseases."
2020-07-27 16:04:01,The sad thing is that many Americans don't have this information either - because we have pro-Trump propoganda outlets posing as legitimate news outlets.
2020-07-27 16:05:26,"While our governments, national and state, have a lot to be blamed for, our citizens should also be part of that blame.
When the CDC put out guidelines on how states could safely reopen, the president, some governors, and many ordinary Joes mocked those guidelines.
When we can’t sacrifice our fun and “rights” for a few months, can’t and won’t see that short term sacrifice will benefit us in the long run, there is something wrong with us.
We still have many people who think this virus is a hoax. Why? Because if they or someone they know did not get the virus, it means it does not exist. I wonder if these people think the same of cancer or heart disease.
This video should be shown over and over again on all media platforms to all of us here in the USA, whether we like it or not, if only to show us that the world no longer looks at us as the leader as it did in the 1950’s and ‘60’s. We still think the world revolves around us, but over the years the rest of the world has passed us by. And what would be the typical United Statesian response be to anyone pointing out our failings?  “Hey, if you don’t like it here, leave, or leave us alone.”
We’re number one? Yes, but only in military might and Covid deaths. 
Sad."
2020-07-27 16:08:08,"Thank you for providing a look at what youth outside the U.S. think about us. They are from what we think are leftist countries who find it unbelievable that we are so backward in how we care for our people.

I hope that we get rid of Trump this November, but I don't have much hope for change that we need from Bidden. He'll just carry on in the center of an Oligarchy, helping the richest get richer, although I hope he will regulate malfeasance. But he won't support the kinds of policy cited by the youth in this video: universal healthcare, public health funding, or in a similar NYT video last year, low cost universities, parental leaves. I do hope he gets an infrastructure program going, but I worry that he won't ensure that it pays workers well or caps executive salaries. A good infrastructure program will be environmentally sound, with worker-supporting jobs that will rev our economy.

I fear Bidden will support whatever the Oligarchs want, and that is none of the things listed above - it's all for profit in their eyes. Profit is their God that must be obeyed at all costs.

Maybe after Bidden America will wake up and reinvent us to be a diverse, racially just country for the people, of the people, by the people. That's a very leftist ideal that will take a revolution to enact in this extremist country we have now that can bring a young woman to tears."
2020-07-27 16:09:09,"Trump ran with the slogan 'Make America Great Again'. Instead he has transformed a once great nation into what is essentially a third world country. A country that cannot look after the health of its citizens. A country in economic turmoil. A country with continuous fighting in its street...and the list goes on.

In a recent (July 6) Nanos poll, commissioned by the Globe and Mail asking Canadians if they wanted the Canadian-US border to reopen, more than 80% responded NO!"
2020-07-27 16:09:29,This pandemic is a litmus test for  every nations resilience with regard to social coherence; to the functionality of the health and education system; to good governance; to social security. I leave it to the reader to judge the U.S. performance.
2020-07-27 16:11:34,"We know how we got into this predicament. I am only embarrassed by the president that took us here. Otherwise, I am impervious to outsider opinions. We will be back soon as still everyone’s best option as a nation."
2020-07-27 16:15:02,"One piece of this is misleading.  When the video presents information on unemployment and the stimulus checks, no mention is made of unemployment insurance and the extra $600 per week which was added to the regular unemployment insurance.  I realize that there have been significant problems with the unemployment insurance programs, with many people still not having received any checks.  But not to mention either unemployment inusrance or the extra $600 is disingenuous and misleading--and, in a real sense, dishonest, since it left all of those viewers with the distinct impression that the only help people received was the stimulus check."
2020-07-27 16:15:19,"We're a transatlantic family, spending roughly three months per year in the Netherlands and 9 months per year in America (in normal times; right now, of course, we are unable to travel). For this American stuck in the Netherlands, watching the news has been tough. We - the Dutch - are generally acknowledged to have had one of the worst European responses to COVID, and the airwaves are filled with concern, heartbreak, accusation, and recrimination. There are stories about overwhelmed hospitals and insufficient support for various groups. I have lived here long enough, on and off, to know that Europe is not perfect and that some of our issues are grave indeed. I feel very concerned for the Netherlands pretty much on essentially a daily basis. But then we stream NPR or Facetime with family in Florida, Colorodo, Utah, and Texas, and it makes my heart hurt all over again. The bad news here seems so quaint. We have had deaths - lots of them - but not as badly as America, and with much more government support than America has had. We are eligible for some of that support and comparing it with what has been discussed in the USA, I mean, I despair for the American economy even if the virus is conquered quickly.

The biggest difference, though, is access to healthcare."
2020-07-27 16:15:58,I worked at our embassies and consulates from 1996 until 2012 and only once was a bit ashamed to be the face of the US when I encountered protestors outside our consulate in Osaka after the 2003 Iraq invasion.  Representing the US as a diplomat in today's environment must be a real challenge.
2020-07-27 16:17:29,"Why is it that a woman thousands of miles away, in South Korea, understands and feels the tragedy of the lives lost in the US more deeply than our own president or the large number of people who still don't take the pandemic seriously?  Why haven't more people in the US seen those images of mass graves here in our country?  The two are related.  Mainstream media's coverage of the deaths in the US has been disconcertingly distant.  It won't feel real to us until we see - and feel - the toll this pandemic has taken on our fellow citizens."
2020-07-27 16:25:37,"Hopefully soon America retains its earlier status - a well developed nation, a superpower. et al. Some White House Administration officials including Trump may not be working better during this pandemic time. But there are as usual, volunteers, medical professionals, mortuary workers and so many young covid warriors are really doing a great job during this pandemic time, risking their own lives. Occasionally some unwanted shootings here and there, some racism protests. Hopefully all such things will come down in the come days. Let us hope  in the coming days more undergo testing for possible virus symptoms, get treated and go home happily and healthily. Let us make America once again the Super Power."
2020-07-27 16:25:53,"Donald Trump rose to power based on his salesmanship, not on any kind of record of achievement or competence - because he has none.

Unfortunately, ""sales techniques"" are useless against an infectious disease. Something which Mr. Trump is finding out the hard way - in terms of his poll numbers. And which the American people are finding out the hard way - as they lose their livelihoods, and in many cases their very lives.

What we need right now are experts in the field of virology to be running things. And what we have instead, is a used car salesman.

It's like putting a home shopping network spokesman in charge of running a nuclear power plant. Or putting an ex-reality TV star in charge of running the most powerful country in the world."
2020-07-27 16:26:47,"I work for a global company with many offices abroad, including Germany, Australia, Luxembourg, etc. The routine conference calls always start off with small talk and banter, but one consistent theme throughout COVID-19 is folks abroad (who themselves are now able to work in offices, while we in the US are not) consistently asking me of the US ""How are you guys doing over there?"" ""Do you expect any improvements? ""We hope things get better for you."" It's really distressing to hear how they look down on us.

Lately I'm fairly certain they don't just mean the coronavirus and America, but America in general and the peril they see us spiraling towards. 

People abroad used to envy us, but now they pity us. How about that?"
2020-07-27 16:29:27,"I grew up I’m Argentina and have travelled to many countries. The worshipping of America has also been based on an image, not a reality. If you look at our infrastructure, our lack health care, our lack of a safety net, our inequality, our lack of education, our violence, our propaganda machine, our poverty, our racism, our weight, we are definitely closer to being underdeveloped. I hope the next generation can pick up the pieces and correct the path this country has taken."
2020-07-27 16:36:59,"Look, I am a very liberal Democrat, but I found the comparison of what other countries did to our stimulus checks misleading. What about the $600 per week. Some people were making more than they did before the layoffs which is fine with me."
2020-07-27 16:37:14,"I feel the same despair as many of my fellow Americans on this thread and was particularly moved by the tears of that South Korean women. But I'm finding myself increasingly sad about the voices who write as if all Americans are ignorant, individualistic, and selfish, conflating us with the GOP leadership and the supporters of Trump who are seeped in outmoded Reagan Era ideology. Plenty of people are following the rules despite lack of leadership from the GOP, plenty are working to feed and help their neighbors. Our political system is nearly 250 years old, and what we're seeing is the expected decline of an unchecked Super Power from an anachronistic electoral process and self-destructing neoliberal ideology in a geographically enormous country with a diverse population that is not governable centrally. Let's instead see this as an opportunity to rebuild, whatever that ends up looking like, and look at the positives: a younger generations that is more left leaning than their parents, a more diverse population than ever, growing pushback against neoliberal capitalism. Our decline may be what saves us — being a Super Power gave us too much wherewithal to fight foreign wars and exploit the resources of other countries. Volunteer to call fellow citizens and encourage them to vote, speak up locally, be the good citizen you want others to be. Just don't despair, otherwise we become no different from Russia. At this point, our nation's history of reinvention is our best hope."
2020-07-27 16:38:32,"I think the American response to the coronavirus has been execrable, from the willful ignorance of the President down to the sheer cussedness of people who won't wear masks and the casual cruelty of those who won't follow social distancing orders. But some of the data in this video are misrepresentative, designed precisely to elicit these horrified responses.

For example, in sheer number of COVID-19 deaths, America leads the world by a great margin. But in terms of number of COVID-19 deaths per capita, many countries are considerably worse, including Belgium (nearly twice as bad as the United States), the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Or, again, thinking about unemployment: the US is in crisis and overall Europe has handled compensation, rent moratoria, furloughs, and unemployment support far better than we have. But the graph used here shows absolute number of Americans who have lost their jobs, in historical perspective. On this graph, 2020 looks far, far, far worse than the early 1930s. This just reflects the growth of the US workforce (and the population generally): in fact, in 1933, the American unemployment rate topped out at just under 25% of the population; in the era of COVID we haven't yet hit 15%. This is *awful* and is being handled *very badly,* but it is not in fact the worst labor crisis America has ever seen. Things are bad enough already. You don't need to exaggerate for effect."

That's why the number is over 150,000, three times as many died in the Vietnam war, and if it keeps on going at this rate we might reach 500,000 the number that died in the Civil War.

It is Trump and his Republican ""free market"" ideologues in power that are responsible. Tests? Let the free market provide. Swabs? Let Governors call China at 3 am and see if they can get a box.

All other developed nations have done better at containing the virus, and never less the Trump administration persisted. Causing the deaths of 150.000 people, having 4 million cases with 11 percent unemployment is doing ""A Pretty Good Job"" against America.

I refused to believe this after 2016, but it's the truth: we are stupid as a nation.

We've failed to educate ourselves.

Please, Americans of all ages, teach your children well so they grow up to see what's right and wrong, with respect for others, and have courage to stand up to injustice.

For too many years, it was about teaching kids to be 'successful' and be competitive. That strategy partly succeeded: we have this maddening situation where about 4 out of 10 are willing to vote for this __________ (you fill in the blank), and killing more than 150,000 Americans in the process. More will die, for sure.

The upcoming election won't be a quick fix. It will take at least a generation or two for America to get back to the world stage as a respected and revered nation we once were."

My father was an immigrant and refugee from a war torn place. Neither of my parents had a college degree. We lived in a small apartment in NYC. I went to college, had a terrific education mostly paid for by the US government, and went on to a good job and career. Had I remained in the home country of my father I might be a homeless refugee, living in fear of my life, and with few prospects.

I contrast the refugee coming here to start a new life with the obviously well-off people who have opportunity to move to other places where they feel more comfortable and can escape - not fear for their lives, but escape from the obligations of trying to make their homeland a better place.

I have no respect for you."

It was Trump's indifference and anti-science attitude that allowed this catastrophe to go on unabated (150,000 deaths, many totally 'unnecessary', under his belt).

With regard to Covid, what makes the situation so tragic in the United States is the total absence of an efficient health care system that would be accessible to all, despite the enormous costs involved. Highest in the world per capita. Thinking that the fate of Obamacare, the only, modest, first step towards something resembling an acceptable health system is mesmerizing. Knowing that it could be struck down is properly unthinkable in Europe.

See the global study on the effectiveness of health systems in 191 countries published by the WHO where France comes first, Canada 27th and the USA a distant 37th.

What to do? GOP Trump was also left lame in service to the GOP ideology of NEVER spending federal money for any form of health care service.
Thus Americans were left to the pandemic on their own. Trump would vocalize magical thinking about a miracle cure coming soon to a theater near you! Soon folks!!
Everything else Trump has done when using the few tools left have been nothing but a dog and pony show. Our stable genius knows more than the medical experts so no nationwide or even statewide mandates to wear the liberal mask of shame. Testing if company CEO's see a profit but nothing more.

At the current rate the US will be world leader in every Corona related issues within a couple of months, and your economy will continue to tank.

This is without comparison the worst US crisis ever, and it is absolutely self-inflicted. The US is hid behind oceans, the richest nation in the world, with immense scientific resources. Yet your president managed to squander it all, and make many millions unemployed, destroyed millions of small businesses and jobs forever, threaten millions of American homes and families, while funneling billions to his already very rich sponsors.

In any other developed nations such an inadequate malign grifting idiot would have been driven out with an effective  general strike locking down everything and truly mass demonstrations long ago.

This is a series of interviews, not an opinion, but masquerades in the 'safe-harbor' opinion section. This purposely biased article doesn't really deserve a a real response, but here it is anyway, for documentation purposes:

1. No mention of the debacles of Cuomo, De Blasio or Murphy (NJ). No mention of different timing, curves and effective immunity rates. No mention or discussion of the federal system in the US.

2. No mention of the replacement of income through state unemployment agencies and through the additional $600/week federal subsidy.

3. No mention of the per-capita death rates and the comparison to other countries.

4. No mention of the CDC (the scientists) botching of testing kits leaving the US to fly blind in February.

5. No mention of the 2020 expected decline in GDP in comparable countries. One person mentioned that businesses can be rebuilt but lives can't be restored. That is partially true. It is a policy discussion, but the 'facts' presented for a reaction were not adequate for her determination. And, permanently destroying tens of millions of people's livelihoods and careers is not a flip decision.

6. No mention that Japan manages the virus without much testing. Many countries manage the virus without much mask wearing. In a vast, diverse U.S., there will be many different ways to manage the virus.

7. No discussion of the importance of U.S. civil liberties - for everyone, globally.

There are more."

The United States pretends to be a democracy but it is an oligarchy in which those in power will do whatever they can to maintain control.  For decades the Republican party has done everything it could to undermine fairness in government which would normally translate into fairness for people.  The United States government has devolved into a clown car full of liars and cheats who seem to have more contempt for its citizens than any sense of obligation.  Failing institutions usually end with people in leadership who are incompetent or crooks. Hence the quartet of Mr. Trump, the babbling buffoon in chief; Mr. Barr, the distorter of truth; Mr. Pompeo, the Mussolini imitator; and Mr. McConnell, the king of unfairness.  They have destroyed what was left of good government in order to maintain control. Watching these young people from different countries react to the ridiculous and sad statistics about the United States serves to confirm the shock, deep sadness and shame the majority of Americans feel about their country at this time.  The reality is that there are huge deficiencies is health care, education, fair wages and taxes to allow for people's security.  The pandemic has laid bare the hypocrisy of American politics.  Climate change will be the final nail in the coffin.  It's time to start over."

Leaving aside childish South America countries like Argentina and , worst of all, Brazil, the developed world rightly disdains childishness, and raises kids to be mature, rational adults, a process epitomized in Germany and Japan. By contrast, the Boomers literally made ""forever young"" their generational mantra, with the ""What, me worry?"" results we see all around us in the worst, most ludicrous response to Covid-19 on earth. What a shock that the Boomer-made America which elected their Narcissist-in-Chief president in 2016 turned out to be totally stupid and. incompetent in its response to the virus in most sections of the country!

It's as appropriate now as it was then & that's the problem, I think Americans really don't care that 149,000 people lost their lives to the virus; it's simply a number, like a medal tally at the SummerOlympics, who could deny the U.S. would set the bar so high.

And not only the deplorable management of the pandemic, and the lives lost as a result, is the fact that the Republican Senate has sat for two months on a bill for financial aid to the unemployed only to have found a way to water down the Congressional bill, and to cause the desperate unemployed to see their benefits expire, not knowing when or if they will receive assistance.  Our Country is being run by wealthy Trump sycophants incapable of knowledge, efficiency, and  compassionate governing led by a mentally impaired President who can recite, ""person, man, woman,camera, TV,"" to demonstrate what a stable genius he is.

2020-07-27 15:52:46,"This is why the Times is junk journalism (a redundancy, I know).  Did you show the young people around the world the per capita death rates for major western European countries?  There are seven I believe with higher death rates than the US and 2-3 others that are close.  The fact is that for most of western Europe ex Germany and Austria (and I'm not certain why their death rates are so low) -- have approximately the higher or the same death rates.  

At this point, it is unclear what factors make a given population more or less vulnerable to CV-19.  But it is entirely possible that America's obesity level, the % of the population with DB2, high blood pressure, etc. may have contributed to our death rate.  Our testing rates may have also contributed to our case rates.

Further, we don't have great data on the testing rates of other countries or how they are accounting for deaths -- so until we know all the facts it's a little early to point fingers.

But if you're pointing fingers, don't forget to point at governors Cuomo and Murphy who mismanaged the crisis when it broke out around NYC then compounded things by ordering long term care facilities to admit CV-19 patients.  That had nothing to do with Trump -- and if Trump had stepped in over Cuomo and Murphy and directed the response the left would have screamed bloody murder."

Once community transmission got out of control in the USA because of Trumps easy going attitude and not wanting to affect the economy, then your only hope was a vaccine.

Granted, of course they’re going to beat us on some respects, like small ball solidarity and well being metrics. But you know what? We have these states called Iowa, Wisconsin, Vermont,  and New Hampshire - each one of them a little “Sweden” or “Germany,” each one with CV-19 numbers that are better than theirs, with education and quality of life stats that are just as good if not better, and populations made up mostly of white Euro types. Here’s the thing though; these places, like Europe, are generally pretty boring, cultural backwaters even. 

And you what the clearest case of cultural dominance is, ironically enough? They can’t even come up with their own darn causes worth protesting over. China can put a thousand Uighers in a camp, and not a peep. But they see cool Americans doing the George Floyd Protest, and like the dorks they are, they wind up with their own BLM movements and protesters in London, Paris, and Berlin.

Over the last few days a friend in Dublin came across a couple from Oklahoma who repeated the (early) Trump line that it’s just a bad flu. Seriously!! How many deaths does it take? And some still show no concern because the majority of the deaths are elderly, in care homes or have a compromised immunity. So answer this, if you have failed so miserably in this ‘dry run’ pandemic, how do you think you’ll fare when a ‘real’ pandemic that affects everyone across the board?"
2020-07-27 16:41:05,"The virus has showed that superficiality is America’s greatest weakness. Conservatism in the US thrives upon it, telling it like it is when it clearly isn’t.  Republican dogma is replete with superficiality: it purports to protect the unborn foetus as a sacred being then blithely casts it into a miserable existence as soon as it is born to a poorer, less privileged family.

Those of us outside of the US who want it to be better understand that America historically emerged from a moral vacuum, white men dressed as Mohawks casting bales of tea into Boston harbour, and has remained largely in one ever since. It has, in a hermetically sealed geo-social experiment, engendered delusions about itself, Manifest Destinies, American Dreams, etc, that have done little more than to muddy the waters of reality. There has been enough open tracts that have allowed someone to feel free while they imprison themselves within their own prejudices.  As a result, white privilege feels threatened and prone to lashing out. Conservatism wants to let it, doing the bloody work of social division.

It is no wonder America is in the mess that it is.  The miracle is that it will survive. Though its delusions hinder, they do not hobble optimism which is a positive pandemic that has long infected America with its brashness and unabashed joy. It will recover from this atrocious period and lead the world once more into a profound future of true enlightenment.

Of that, I am certain."
2020-07-27 16:57:59,"The essential difference between the Republicans and The Democrats is this; Republicans value PROFIT over the health and well being of the population, even their own heath and well being. Let's call this Egoism. The Democrats value Health And Well Being over profit, even their own profit. Let's call this Altruism.
 
Both Egoism and Altruism are in our behavioral genetic makeup and both are essential to our evolution. The trick is to know when to emphasize one, or, the other. Even better, to establish laws which maintain a balance between Altruism and Egoism through time.
 
Human recorded history, from today, back to 4,500 B.C. records the violent re-distribution of wealth, over and over again. Egoism gets out of balance and Altruism, 'All for One and One for All' corrects the imbalance. At which point, the dance of Egoism and Altruism begins anew across the ballroom floor of eternity.

Historically, The USA thrived when the tax rate on the wealthy was in the 70-85% range. Today it is half that with numerous loop holes engineered to assist in avoiding taxes altogether.

Donald The Clown and his GOP minion's success at lowering corporate taxes to 'increase employment' failed miserably. The money was squirreled away or used to buy back stock.
They laughed all the way to their banks.

Now take this same situation global and it's easy to see why the only home we have, our planet, is so stressed by Egoism, that is, Profit first, the health of The Earth, who cares."
2020-07-27 15:57:26,"I used to include an appeal for Trump to either voluntarily or be summarily convinced to resign immediately in many of my NYT comments.  Shaming by many Americans and our still loyal world wide supporters hasn’t made any difference.  He’s still with us.  My next suggestion:  Made Trump’s birthday National Humiliation Day.  I know June 14 is most significant for being Flag Day, but too many people have died and Trump loves to wrap himself around flags.  The flags feel the humiliation also.  We let him get away with too much and almost 150,000 people have paid the price so far.  More will pay before he is gone.

We need to come to the realization that elections count and make sure everyone can vote, regardless of race, creed or what’s in their pocketbook.  There is too much violence, too many dead children and we need to learn to protect every citizen.  Homelessness is another form of mental illness.  All sick people need help, not to loose everything to an avaricious healthcare system.  And our constant wars - too many dead.

Let’s start taking responsibility for policies and behaviors that have led to the less fortunates’ suffering.  First step:  Trump is just a symptom, but a tangible one that can easily be rebutted.  If he won’t go now (which would save a lot of lives), vote him out in November."

I was part of an international community of foreign teachers. All of them came from countries that were part of the hub-and-spoke economic & security system America created after WWII.  All of their countries made this bet on the basis that America would practice sound civics, at least internationally if not nationally (see the lack of M4A). In the Bush years it was clear that the GOP was practicing Junk Civics at home and abroad. 

In fact the GOP has been bargaining in bad faith since 1979 and they have ruined the country, and  if not entirely, its not for lack of trying. Now we are coping with Trump. The absurdity of the GOP has no end. 

The GOP, like Trump is Junk Civics, pure and simple.

The Dems aren't much better. Bernie was the only candidate with practical proposals to deal with the real problems we face - health insurance not tied to employment or M4A, paid sick leave, loan foregiveness, free higher education all practical approaches to improve society in the future and address the crisis we face now. The Democrats destroyed Bernie and for that, they are traitors to the working class.

Trump is playing to his uninformed base while handling the coronavirus like an Emperor dealing with the plague in the Dark Ages. 

Americans need to know how many lives could have been spared if Trump had not disbanded the CDC Pandemic Response Team in 2018 and slashed operational funding of the CDC experts; if Trump had listened to the early warnings of intelligence agencies and the CDC about a pandemic arriving from China; if testing supplies and PPE and ventilators had been MASSIVELY scaled up in January; if universal nationwide testing had been initiated in early February at the latest; if Trump had not said the pandemic was a left wing media hoax. Americans need to know how many lives could have been saved if we did not have an ignorant, uninformed egomaniac Trump in the White House who has done everything possible to worsen the spread of disease including his insane refusal to wear a mask.

Let’s do this as multiple choice.

A. Social distance and wear masks. 
B. Get together in large groups and not wear masks.
C. Listen to local authorities’ safety rules and suggestions. 
D. Defy local authorities and be free... this is a democracy!  
E. Send your kid back to school because the Feds insist.
F. All of the above.

Please feel free to choose as many answers as you like but if you want to just pick ""F"" to save time that works, too.  The end result is the global epicenter has moved to the USA, and we are now facing more new daily cases than ever.  We're not even allowed to enter certain countries because they fear our disease.  All thanks to policies (or lack of) which have made the virus all-American.  It's the Trumpandemic now.

We've left out the deflection games of blaming the virus on China, blaming it on the left-wing media trying to hurt Trump's re-election chances, blaming the increase in cases on an increase in testing, comparing it to the harmless old flu - conveniently forgetting masks were required by law in the 1918 epidemic, and many other tricks a streetcorner 3 Card Monte dealer would envy.

Rather, it's the hypocrisy demonstrated by the Democratic Party that pretends to represent the poor, and yet, has been very clear that it wants to increase the country's intake of unskilled workers.   As if wages aren't low enough already!

How will voting ""Blue"" put the country on a better road, when the Democratic Party is as beholden to corporate and the wealthy class as the Republican Party?

America's problems - and solutions - do not rest with either the Democratic or Republican Parties. 

Voting Blue is as shallow and ignorant as it gets be because it guarantees the status quo remains as is;  i.e., no political party that cares about its poorest residents.

I believe that these factors have played a role in keeping us from acknowledging the soundness of the Chinese response to COVID and following suit. The Chinese understood that COVID is bound by the laws of physics and biology and mounted a coordinated national response based on science. Apparently our government felt the need to do exactly the opposite. We have decided to emphasize differences when the real lesson of this pandemic  is that people are essentially the same.

A blind man could see that Trump is a barking lunatic and all of the other guys at least live in the real world not a fantasy one inside of their heads.  Yet 60 million Americans voted for Trump, and there are still people who support him.  But they are only part of the problem.  The rest of the Republican Party which has turned its back on the country to enable Trump deserve more than scorn.  Trump is an incompetent who is unaware of the impacts of his actions.

I wish every single one of us strength in judgement, wisdom in judgement, compassion, perseverance and faith. 

Because this time around, it feels like it’s not a threat to eradicate humanity like back in the eighties. 

This time around, it is both invisible and everywhere like it had never been before. 

If we all gather in spirit around the world with love and compassion for those who live, and for those who have to live with the loss, and live in harmony with the many souls that have left the planet this year, perhaps some day in the future we‘re understanding how interconnected humanity is, and how one of its traits isn‘t omnipotence, but fragility, sensitivity, and kindness.

Expertise is particularly critical in dealing with a pandemic.  The COVID-19 scenario was predicted in advance, and the US had contingency plans to prevent its spread.

Under ANY normal president, the US would have been working with China, allies, and international agencies last November and December, to prevent this pandemic from leaving China to begin with.

Instead, Trump fired all the planners, denied the science, and refused all collaboration.

Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Depression.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

2020-07-27 18:11:01,"This was sobering to watch as I recounted what it was like to live in what was the epicenter of the pandemic. Then when you see the numbers of infections and deaths juxtaposed to the garbage spewing from the President's mouth it is frightening and disturbing on so many levels.  Especially, when I recount the deaths of people  that I knew including a very good neighbor. Deaths that did not have to occur. 

Somehow we elected a person whose sole interest is himself and not the people he took an oath to serve.  This coupled with his incredible incompetence has cost this country so much in terms of loss of lives; people's health; and economic damage/devastation. 

The fact that people around the world look at this with amazement merely reflects the fact that a certain level of competency is typically demanded of political leaders.  The tragedy is that it has taken Covid-19 to reveal what was readily apparent all along."
2020-07-27 18:09:00,"We see lots of people in expensive, petrol guzzling 4W Drive vehicles moaning on TV that they haven't enough money to live on and need to get food parcels and go to food kitchens.
I'm of the opinion lots of them are living above their means and need budgeting services. First thing to do is ditch the petrol guzzling 4WD and buy a cheap Japanese import. Maybe the NY Times needs to write some articles about how to budget and live within your means. People need to get adjust to their change in circumstances and government needs to give them budgeting help."
2020-07-27 18:12:51,"Well interviewing a bunch of young people who's minds are fed by mainstream press telling them what to think is hardly a qualitative thing to share. That said, yes, America has had such a terrible response to the crisis that speaks to a wider health care problem."
2020-07-27 18:11:08,"It's an absurd trope to chant ""American Exceptionalism"" and superiority. The truth is we look ridiculous in the eyes of the world, and with good reason. Covid-19 was always going to take a toll, but it was possible to bring it under control. That possibility has shrunk to a microdot in this country, and things will likely get far worse before they get better. 

It's easy to blame our public health experts. Still, countries had the same ever-changing, often flawed information. The difference is their approach to Covid-19 changed with their learning curve. Here, politicians dug in, denied reality, and saw blame where they should have seen new knowledge about a novel virus. 

It's the American people who suffered, and will continue to suffer. There is one person above all to blame: Donald Trump. And with him, his GOP enablers, Both will forever have the blood of thousands on their hands."
2020-07-27 18:14:33,"The rest of the world feels sorry for us now. So much winning ... if only public shaming would work on Trump. Alas, it doesn't. The man has no shame let alone decency."
2020-07-27 18:19:19,"Watching this almost made me cry.  I am old enough to remember when we were the envy of the world and did great things.  We had an irrepressible optimism and reveled in our freedom. Today we are pitied by other advanced countries.

I knew of every instance covered in the video with the exception of mass graves.  I have not heard of mass graves in the US and I am frankly skeptical that they exist.  Perhaps the authors could cite a reference?"
2020-07-27 18:13:31,"As an American, this video makes me emotional. 140,000 of my fellow Americans have died, and Donny doesn’t seem to care. I hate that man more than you can ever know."
2020-07-27 18:14:52,"I'm an Italian living in Spain. 

The video is impressive, but I'd like to stress a couple of concepts, which they might sound redundant, but maybe not.

1) You are not in such a bad situation because you're American, you're in such a bad situation because you are led by one of the most incompetent, ignorant and childish (beside many other things) men on earth

2) We've been lucky because we happen to have, in this historical moment, leaders like Conte, Sanchez, Merkel etc. Of course we wouldn't have anti-mask rednecks wearing war-weapons occupying capitols anyway, but in Italy, for instance, there were populist leaders of the opposition calling for anti-government gatherings with no social distancing and no masks just during the pandemic peak.
In England another populist, Boris Johnson, had to be close to leave the hospital in a wooden box in order to realize how serious the matter was.

What I'd like to say, if this can be of any consolation, is that, if all this had happened a few years back, with Obama at the White House and maybe Salvini/Meloni/Berlusconi ruling Italy, the situation could be the other way around.

All my best wishes to you all. And please, get rid of that puppet as soon as you can, he's literally destroying your country."
2020-07-27 18:15:26,"This video reminds me of two observations. 

First, as candidate Trump said, ""The world is laughing at us, and at the stupidity of our leaders."" 

Second, as Irish journalist Fintan O'Toole wrote, ""the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.""

Those two statements tell us what we need to know about America under this president and the choice we have to make in November."
2020-07-27 18:16:16,"As if the abuse of the Trump administration and the Republican party weren't enough, now all Americans--regardless of political orientation and voting behavior--must now endure the contempt of foreigners. It is a lonely time to be a Democrat."
2020-07-27 18:17:50,The world isn’t laughing at us- but they are sure sickened by trumps extraordinarily pathetic response to the virus. Many friends and family elsewhere in the world feel sorry for us- and hope our November election results in trumps ejection.
2020-07-27 18:18:39,"It feels repugnant to have people from foreign countries weeping over the fate of America and Americans, since we are the capital of billionaires and the pillar of the first world. We don't deserve tears and/or pity."

2020-07-27 18:21:58,"I weep for my adopted nation.  I never became an American, because I did not agree with the way it treated the old and poor.  I became one, when Trump started running, not because I thought he would be elected, but just in case, because I had American kids and thought my green card might be in jeopardy.  I've watched the slow roll down hill, of a country I enthusiastically embraced.  How could we let this happen, I said again and again.  My kids embraced the other nation I gave them citizenship to, and we all now live in Canada.  Canadians are generally polite and the only thing they say now, is I hope they keep the border closed until there is a vaccine.  I have lived in dozens of countries and hear from friends around the world.  That girl crying made me cry too....how could we let this great country slip away?  Why do Americans vote against their own interests?  Why, oh why, haven't Republicans rebuffed this monster? Mostly though, I feel for the people who have lost their loved ones.  It's just so sad."
2020-07-27 18:22:31,"I write this as the son of immigrants.

The fundamental American problem is We The People.  We left our homelands to come here; confused, unhappy, angry.  We brought these things to America with us, and our response reflects that perfectly.

In 1918 we fought a worse plague and a world war at the same time.  That America, the one that John Kennedy spoke of, ""ask not what your country can do for you..."", no longer exists.

Trump is a symptom, not the cause.  I am the problem, and so are you.  It is a form of denial to attribute our problems to someone or something else.  So now what do we do?  That will reveal our character and determine our fate."
2020-07-27 18:22:36,"My husband and I left our family and friends (except our daughter, who lives in the UK) to move to France in 2017. We did it because we feared growing old there, among other things. Now we have to sit and watch our dear loved ones face this horror every day, and we can do nothing to help them — except vote."
2020-07-27 18:20:04,"What was shown to the world was an Incompetent Trump Administration who for some reason decided in January 2020, when they received news that a pandemic was on its way to strike not only the US but the world, and that was to ignore it, it would go away on its own, it was a simple flu, heat and humidity would kill it, unbeknownst to Trump heat and humidity act like an incubator and makes cells flourish. So what will become of the US, COVID in the eyes of the world, it will be known as the greatest failure an American President was unable to tackle and a detriment to many good American People who have been infected, have lost their lives and wonder every day, can it get any worse, the answer is yes, unless the Republican Party decides to do what should have been done at the onset of this broken government, and that is simply to govern and guide their citizens to a bright future and not to the darkness that lies before them."
2020-07-27 18:23:26,They’re laughing at us. That’s what Trump used to say. Turns out that was the most obvious of his psychological projections. They’re laughing at us now.
2020-07-27 18:25:39,"We look on in the US with great sadness. Wearing masks should have never been politicized as a culture wars issue. People should have seen it in the same light as seat belt laws, secondhand smoke laws and helmet laws. These laws are in place because other people are affected, not just one person.

But because people have been brainwashed not to believe mainstream media, here we are.

Please get your act together and vote Trump out. Your lives very literally depend on it."
2020-07-27 18:27:41,"I just read on another news' source that Trump only pivoted on his ideas about the coronavirus when aides pointed out that red states are now spiking with cases. Aides told him those are ""our people."" Trump didn't care at all when people in New York and California were dying. Now that they're dying in Texas and Arizona and Florida, he suddenly cares.

What kind of president is only concerned with a small population of the country he leads?"
2020-07-27 18:27:54,"The saddest part is that Trump still has not lost a single supporter in spite of this blunder of historical proportions.  He could be responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths but for his supporters, he is doing a great job. 
And as for the rest of America, it seems it has resigned itself to its fate;  too numb to act.
I won't be surprised if Trump wins another term and things get even worse. We still have not reached the bottom."

To keep your economy healthy you have to invest money in your people - not just the one per cent.
There is an unprecedented demand overseas for our products as well. Concept and a feeling of wellness is very important when buying stuff. You get a feel good factor knowing you're buying produce from a nation where there is no community transmission. Your nations health is your wealth. Without healthy citizens how can you produce brain boxes who invent and help bring your economy back from the brink. Old people are important too; as they are the teachers of the young. If you loose all your knowledgeable people to covid-19 whose going to educate the next generation. Your children are your future. Without health and wellness in your society you cannot nourish and grow the brain boxes in your society.
I'm a bit concerned where all this is going to end for the USA if a vaccine is not found; and especially concerned about your nation after the elections. There are rumblings in USA of mini civil wars going on for all the wrong reasons when your priority should be eliminating the virus .

You forgot to note that Vietnam has an 800 mile long border with China and that its earliest cases were directly from Wuhan. I was in Vietnam for the duration of the pandemic there. Vietnam's smart, early and quick action is what protected Laos and Cambodia, who followed their lead. The refusal of the media in the US to acknowledge the brilliant response of the Vietnamese government is bizarre, because of all governments in the world, Vietnam's handled this the best. The praise heaped upon South Korea is perhaps well-deserved, as they have a huge expat population in China. But Vietnam is both more populous and in closer proximity, and yet we hear no praises for their far superior response. 

And now, like the whole region (indeed, much of the world) it is suffering from the loss of tourism dollars because it cannot reopen its borders to general tourism."

American government is hamstrung by an unworkable 18th century constitution that no nation now would willingly adopt, and that plus the myth of exceptionalism goes a long way to explain the current mess."

We are the pariah of the world and we earned every laugh, snicker, scorn, cheer, clap and maybe some pity, though we don't even deserve that.

2020-07-27 19:15:58,"I put a lot of America's problems in the lap of Reagan Republicans. They knew what they were doing when they abolished the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. It opened the door for Fox News, Sinclair Broadcast Group, and the virulent right wing hate machine that dominates AM radio throughout the country.  

There's a direct line from 1987 to the many people who think wearing a mask is an infringement of their rights. They've been told for 30 years that Democrats are evil. That feminists are feminazis. That Sandy Hook was a hoax. That transgenders are lurking at every public bathroom.

So when Democratic governors mandated masks, of course that was evil. When Trump said Covid-19 was a hoax, they believed it.  They watch and listen to the ""news"" instead of reading it in depth. They clearly don't read any news coming directly from the people of Portland who confirm that the federal agents have made things worse. And sadly, they won't see this video. And if they did, their hubris would compel them not to care what foreigners think."

Republicans, including the Never-Trumpers, are just too far gone. The likes of Ross Douthat and David Brooks don't seem to have abandoned the extremes of market fundamentalism.

Not that racial justice is not overdue ( by at least a century ) but at this very moment an anti-government movement seems more important because it subsumes all other issues: the minorities are the most affected by the Covid 19 pandemic, poverty and unemployment, coupled with loss of medical insurance make things untenable without federal help, that the GOP is reluctant to provide.

There are many reasons for this country being successful in effectively eliminating the virus, first and foremost being strong -and empathic- leadership -the critical missing element in the US. And unlike Trump, our PM -also facing an election in 2 months time- is basking in record levels of support. 
Trump is pretty much a figure of comedy here amongst most NZers [there are some who think differently of course] -and we would be laughing if it actually wasn't so tragic watching the rapid decline of the US and the deaths of so many of your citizens."

Today it was MLB.  Doesn't matter;  by Thanksgiving we'll have overrun hospitals;  most of their space given over to fighting the virus;  and it's going to last at least until next summer if not years.

I have been fortunate enough to travel internationally for work and play and I can assure every American we have been mocked for decades now.

Soon after 9/11 and the Bush era it become obvious to the world we were not the dominant player we thought we were.

The difference is that until 2016 most of the world laughed at us under their breath. Since 2016, the laughter is out loud and right in our faces.

If you do not think that is the case in the EU you'll have to take my word for it because Americans are not allowed into the EU.

2020-07-27 20:41:25,"Not to defend the federal response at all, but playing devil's advocate a bit: Is the U.S. just too big and regionally and demographically diverse to make a top-down, one-size federal plan work effectively here? It's easier for the likes of Sweden or Denmark, nations with a fraction of our population (each the size of Maryland); comparing the U.S. to them is apples and oranges. Larger countries like China and Russia aren't concerned with civil liberties or freedom when clamping down on their populace. Let's face it, some regions of the U.S. have little in common other than language (as evidence in the people they elect) and why there's so much resistance to a national effort. We can't agree what color the sky is these days much less how to reconfigure society to battle a virus in a matter of months.

Tell me again what the electoral college is for? And why do they still exist?
What comes next? Rhetorical. And this sounds dramatic, but Rome is burning. Has been for some time now.
Where are the adults in the room besides Dr. Fauci and a handful of others? For those of you that think my health and my life or anyone else's, is expendable, I/we too have a right to be well.

Obviously, it's very powerful to have someone from Senegal shocked by how poorly we've handled the virus, but I don't understand as an ex-pat Canadian why Canada is never mentioned.

Alberta, where my elderly parents live (who I would be required to quarantine away from for 12 days even if it was an emergency), has had 178 deaths in a province of 3.7 million people and they have also successfully flattened the curve.

I agree that our society has become inhumane and it’s unfair to insinuate that our dismal response to this pandemic can be placed at the feet of immigrants - legal or illegal. It’s squarely on the shoulders of the current administration, the complicit Republicans, and the self-center and self-absorbed faction of our society who can think of no one but themselves. We will continue to decline as a society, because decline we have, until we can honesty view and treat each other on equal terms. That includes equitable and livable wages; and affordable non-employment based access to healthcare. I am not a socialist and believe in our capitalist system, but over the last several decades the deck has been stacked against regular working people, even the college educated. This is a time of upheaval and change. Ours is not a perfect union and never will be, but I sincerely hope our society chooses to move toward equality and justice for all. If we don’t, the great experiment is over and has failed."

I hear everyone say that now but no one then!
Trump was torn apart and called ever name on the books when he imposed the travel ban. Nobody agreed with him...not Dr. F, not Pelosi, not Shumer and most of all not Joe Biden!
We had this virus under reasonable control until Memorial Day. Then the pool and beach parties. Then the parties at outside bars. Then over 2 months of protesting featuring thousands and thousands with no social distancing in most cities in America.

American exceptionalism propaganda will be your downfall. How the world views the USA and how you see yourself are two different visions.
It's not unlike your software and how Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerman were exceptional and invented stuff and you don't seem to have moved past that or innovated since their inventions. You can't live on memories; maybe go back to the beginning and innovate with simple stuff and write books to teach your young like this one that I bought from an Op Shop for $1.

2020-07-27 19:59:27,"If I may comment from a UK perspective, the US has a significant problem with treating the constitution as a sacred religious text and conflating constitutional rights with human rights. Gun rights are the most enduring ineradicable problem because of the second amendment (they have no intrinsic value), but the stupid debates about masks (which have assumed an idiotic partisan character) betrays a deep misunderstanding of the concept of freedom; rights inevitably intersect, which is why they need to be viewed through the lens of proportionality and reasonableness and why they carry corresponding responsibility. The simplistic narrative around constitutional rights (which elements of the political establishment US film and tv industry have peddled over the years) has led the average American to misunderstand what their constitution does and does not guarantee."

Let's just let that sink in: hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to needlessly dying with many more suffering physical and psychological damage. How can we function if politicians can continue this malpractice without being held responsible? Let's start talking prison and they will start getting serious about doing their jobs. I haven't heard this brought up before. It shouldn't be a fringe idea. We should demand it.

The young  and not so young went out without masks and spread this virus around, killing many of their parents and grandparents while they were having fun. If you were one of the ones that went out and gave this stuff to your family, then you will have to live with that guilt for the rest of your lives.

This entire crisis has demonstrated that despite having an incredible amount of wealth and resources, the American government has neither the willpower nor the competence required to ease the effects of the pandemic in the slightest. I think people fail to appreciate how much damage the bungled pandemic response has done to America's international image, which has already been deteriorating since the end of the cold war and the humanitarian disaster that was the invasion of Iraq. Both of our major parties have miserably failed at preventing people from dying by the thousands everyday for months on end. When you look at how the Chinese government's comparatively tame handling of the plague (4,634 deaths doesn't seem so bad right now...), it's obvious that China is positioning itself as the new global leader in lieu of the US.

Even if Biden wins in November, I don't foresee this decline turning around anytime soon. The conservative/neoliberal Democrats like Biden have demonstrated over and over that they're categorically opposed to the kind of substantive reform America badly needs. Sanders' proposals represented the bare minimum of what needs to be done to turn things around and he was viciously condemned on CNN and in the NYT's op-eds as a ""radical"" who ""yelled"" too much..."

2. Mass protests effects on infection rates
3. Was it clear how deaths were counted as deaths With Covid and deaths From/By Covid

Just sheer numbers without critical comparisons of percentages does not reveal accurate interpretation.

There's something about seeing what's happening in the U.S. right now from the perspective of people living outside of the country that is very compelling - and jarring. I honestly do not understand how anyone can possibly still think Trump is a good leader when the evidence to the contrary is staring at us in the face each and every day. Almost 150,000 deaths?! Thousands out of work?! A president who refused to acknowledge the severity of this pandemic or wear a mask for months?!

The simple truth, here in Australia and there in the US, is that there will be no economic recovery until our citizens health is protected. That requires a public understanding of and adherence to preventative approaches to reduce infections as well as a whole of Government approach to ensure standards of infection control are managed and maintained everywhere."
2020-07-27 22:58:37,"They are so right, the way the US continues to behave makes no sense. It is ridiculous.

I look at the photos you (NYT) decide to put on the front page of the on-line version, and I'm shocked every time I see crowds of people. 
What is so hard to understand? Physical distance, people. Physical distance!
Masks too, of course. But only if you care about others. Masks are actually a sign of respect for your fellow human being.  
As evidenced by the photos published, respect for others is a nice memory."
2020-07-27 22:59:20,"The responses of the young people in this video reveal a lower level of compassion and empathy amongst fellow American citizens compared to what is experienced amongst fellow citizens of other countries. If the young people in this video had spent several months living in America prior to appearing in the video, they may not have been as surprised. Individual responsibility is more highly valued by many Americans compared to social responsibility and a sense of community. This is one reason why many young Americans are not diligent in wearing masks in public to protect vulnerable elderly Americans from exposure to COVID-19."
2020-07-27 23:08:15,"trump, with support of the GOP, is going to bankrupt the United States, just like he did for himself and without a care. 

And they're going to blame YOU for their lack of management. 

While the economy is shutdown (people not working), revenues (taxes) are exponentially reduced. Yet, the unnecessary tax cuts will remain in place. 

National stimulus bills are wasted monies unless we have complementary national rules. As long as trump continues to demand that states open without federal support and adequate testing in place and failing to issue mask and social distancing requirements, it is trump who is delaying our country's ability to get a handle on COVID-19 and get back on our feet. 

it is trump and the GOP who are putting our nation into the close-open, close-open, repeating cycles. The repetitive cycles are going to bankrupt our country, result in businesses forever closed, millions out of jobs and without healthcare, and millions losing their homes and possessions due to evictions and foreclosure. 

The unnecessary massive tax cut will not be rescinded. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, federal assistance to states, all of these things are going to be cut in order to deal with the fiscal shortfall. 

The GOP and trump and trump's base are all complicit in sustaining the pandemic while driving the US into bankruptcy while kicking the poor, the low-wage earners, women, and all minorities off the ledge."
2020-07-27 21:00:24,That other countries are crying feeling sorry for us is shameful. Just shameful.

changed how I view our country.  Here it's laid out how the psychology in West Africa that drove people to refuse medical advice and help to curb ebola infection, actions and denial that are truly moronic, is operating right here in Trump's America.  And more people have died as a result.  We are far worse than any supposedly backward Guinea citizen. 
And it could not have been possible without the alt-right propaganda network (FN, OAN, Limbaugh, etc)."

2020-07-27 20:08:44,Thank you very much for doing this.  We are an embarrassment worldwide because we elected an incompetent president.  It was wonderful to see these people in other countries relating to us and having compassion for us. They recognized the citizens suffering instead of focusing on our horrible leadership.
2020-07-27 20:51:46,"First of all, how can *you,* NYT, take China's stats seriously? Give me a break. Notice how rarely, if ever, they update their stats. They simply are not reporting the reality, and we've read how the Chinese accuse their country of this deception.

To be shocked by the US unemployment at lockdown time: I wonder what these young people were thinking when our unemployment rate was under 4% just months ago. How did it compare their own 12%, 20%? Ours fell hard because employment was super high. 

And the death *rate* in the US per cases is still about 5.5%, waaayyyy under France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, UK, (all 15%+) not to mention Canada, people. Talk about cherry-picking your time frames and stats. And gee thanks for giving the world your distorted picture to serve your political ends."

It's climate change, health-care in general, education, retirement, inequality, poverty, hunger, the environment, militarism, privacy, democracy,...

It's high time the US took a _long look around the world_, to see how others are taking seriously the well-being of people and the environment.

It's scandalous - SHAMEFUL (and pitiful) - how much the arrogance of empire has led the US down the garden path of thinking it has nothing to learn from others. 

And then finds itself surprised that it's in fact far from being Number 1 in anything positive and close to being Number 1 in things negative.

Wake up America. You are slaves to your ideology. You have only your chains to lose."

--stop the virus
--prevent full ICUs, out of ventilators, ""flatten the curve""

But they could have tried, epidemiologists and trump failed."
2020-07-27 20:09:39,Today I read tweets about how Trump is sent by God. I just can't get my head around this kind of ignorance.

A butcher got the surgeon’s job and he keeps killing patients with his butcher’s approach which is the only way he knows how.

2020-07-27 22:33:37,"Dear American people, it really hurts so much to see the land of my childhood dreams suffering like this. To see how an incompetent leader does not restore a whole, wonderful country to its former glory, but leads it completely to disaster. It hurts so much that you are not being united and protected, but being divided and exposed to a disease that almost the whole world handles better (for those who don’t believe: just look at JHU Statistics and count by capita). It is unbelievable how systematically your government lies to you and all this happens in straight in front of our eyes ... 

America was once the land of freedom, justice and democracy. Nothing in the world is as endangered, as fragile and as pitiful as your once great nation. Our country too was led to ruin many years ago by a dangerous leader ... and parts of our people were betrayed and murdered in horrible manner. And in our country, too, most have looked the other way. Don’t look away! Accept no more lies. Demand truth and justice and the protection you deserve! Don't allow yourself to be treated like people of a banana republic ... We can only pray for you. And as good friends, we will!"

2020-07-27 22:32:32,"Maybe some of the countries the people in this video live in will invade the U.S. to save us from our dictator-wannabe, because  his leadership will come for them, in a second term, when he does for global climate change what he did for the U.S. pandemic."

2020-07-27 23:04:02,How embarrassing to expose ourselves like this to the rest of the world.  I cringed when I saw the reactions of the young people from around the globe.

Too many people, at all income levels, like Trump."

Why? If we are doing so pathetic and and thought about so poorly, why there is such a hue & cry when the quota for H1B is slashed by just 10-20,000? Does any one think about that absurdity? Or we have lost our native intelligence too?"

What Americans don't realize, being a rather navel-gazing and isolated culture (how many even know the capital of Canada,) is that we are like the inmates of an insane asylum. We scream that everybody else is crazy with their socialized healthcare, gun laws, and high speed rail. But really, we are the ones who are crazy."
2020-07-27 21:36:49,"The US is a sad, broken and self destructing nation, but the really dreadful things is that it did not have to be like this.

We want the American people to wake up from this horrible nightmare and DO SOMETHING.
But I don't have much hope. 
I KNOW there are so many great and wonderful Americans. But where are they, and why can't they do anything?"
2020-07-27 21:55:36,"To see people from other countries brought to tears and understand the seriousness of COVID while we have huge populations yelling about masks infringing on their personal freedoms and that it is a hoax, only further cements my perspective that we are a nation the breeds and celebrates ignorance and selfishness."

2020-07-27 21:24:14,"I have a friend in Japan who said that as soon as CoVid 19 posed a threat, the Japanese people unified under their leader and took the necessary precautions. She couldn't understand why wearing a mask was considered by many in the USA to be a violation of rights; she seemed alarmed that so many Americans were ignoring fundamental safety guidelines. She also expressed sympathy for our lack of unity. While she made no value judgments or political statements, I inferred from her comments that many people outside of the US think that we are collectively ignorant when it comes to the pandemic. It's embarrassing that they pity us."
2020-07-27 21:39:35,"This brought me to tears, too. Sophia from South Korea has more compassion for lost life than the entire ""GOP party of life"" (a misnomer if ever there was one). If only my right of abode in Hong Kong were still actually useful."
2020-07-27 22:08:00,"Biden should use this video.....especially the lady from Korea in tears. The world weeps for the US. The NYT should go around the US and film a similar video. It will be interesting to see the responses, I predict that we will be surprised."
2020-07-27 21:57:06,"No matter what we say the fact remains. The country is in total chaos and despair because Trump and his merry band of characters totally ignored the Dept. Of Defense concise  Intel in November. That is not a casual report. it is complex and clearm intel view on threats. They only admit January and waited 6 weeks more. Never got in front of it. The result was spread leading to collapse of the economy and his bumbling inaccurate politicizing everything with his ""magic magnifying mind"". The result of Trump covid (niot China) has been poverty, despair and rage. Desperation. Then poor George Floyd's murder was a ""last straw' ""enough is enough""  in the emotional climate. The poor George Floyd horror became the reason to react here and globally. All from Trumps lies, denial of all scientific data  and inaction on covid"

If the Coronavirus pandemic was a test of leadership among all nations where it has occurred, the US will have flunked that test. Our failure will not be due to a lack of material capacity to fight the pestilence, but due to a lack of responsible government. 

With a commander-in-chief who employs experts and mock their efforts or fails to follow their recommendations at every opportunity, his lack of discipline as role model has certainly guaranteed a disaster in our crises management of this pandemic. 

Well done Mr. President."
2020-07-27 21:35:10,"It’s sobering to see that young Koreans and Germans aren’t yet numbed by the American death toll, but many of us seem to be.

We need to snap out of this. American adults, particularly people who are in any kind of leadership position, need to start acting like competent grownups. Today would not be too soon.

And we need to quit listening to loudmouths who make snap judgments backed up by nothing but their gut, or who just make stuff up out of thin air."
2020-07-27 22:52:45,"I don't think people have any perspective on what is going on:

You should tell them that this pandemic is likely to eventually kill MORE Americans that ANY WAR EXCEPT WWII or the American Civil War.

It is far greater than the total number of deaths TOTAL FOR ALL TIME that terrorism has killed.

It will be nearly 15 YEAR's worth of murders and nearly an entire DECADE's worth of deaths from car accidents.

All in a SINGLE year."

2020-07-27 21:53:39,"I got goosebumps in the end. 
All this is coming down to this - the beauty of the USA: Freedom, is what is killing the country right now. 
People seem to be entitled to their freedom and are a bit too selfish to be considerate about others. 
I am from Detroit, where, thanks to Gov. Whitmer, people have to wear masks, and I have been noticing mostly they are. But then again, I am only noticing S-E Michigan (Detroit and metro Detroit). I have heard different stories in other parts of the state, BUT, metro Detroit is heavily populated as compared to rest of MI. 

Be considerate and stop adding Freedom to all the bloody arguments that you have against wearing a mask and social distancing. Think twice, or more in this case.."

2020-07-27 23:30:03,"Not pro or anti-Trump, but to point this out.
I am sure all who believe in evolution will agree with Darwin's observation that only the healthy and adaptable will survive.
So, is the US healthy? With its obesity, drug addictions and now Covid19?
And is the US adaptable? When it is still using degrees Fahrenheit, amateurs in a jury system manipulated by professional lawyers, school summer holidays when farming is no longer the main occupation, paralysis over gun ownership and shooting massacres, just to name a few?
Are these Trump's fault? Should Mike Pompeo worry about his own country long term survivability rather than the perceived threat from China? Will the blinkers for US style democracy and freedom trip up the nation slowly but surely?"
2020-07-27 23:30:06,i can’t describe the utter sadness I feel on a regular basis. We in the northeast laid out a clear roadmap showing exactly what had to be done to keep this in check.  Yes it was going to take some pain and sacrifice  but it could be done.  It was also going to require leadership on both a state and federal level and we know how one half of that has worked out.

My answer: Unfortunately it is not true that ""anyone not happy in our country is free to leave"" as most countries do not take in Americans at this time."
2020-07-27 23:37:04,"What is painful to me is that all this information (about how other countries were handling this virus) was available from the very beginning. At no time did I get the impression that anyone in our government was the least bit interested in looking around to see how other countries were doing it. Why is this information suddenly being presented? I know the answer to this question, of course, but I am just expressing frustration more than anything else."
2020-07-27 23:42:27,Just imagine how our adversaries are studying American dysfunction and how to exploit it in the future.
2020-07-27 23:44:40,"I would admit that our nations response was confusion at best but the USA is still the place to be if you get COVID.  Even with high infection rates, the percentage that die from here is lower than anywhere else in the world.  (Source: John Hopkins website.) We have outstanding doctors, nurses, hospitals and care, in general. One of the many reasons why people want to come to a America."
2020-07-27 23:51:22,"From our vantage point in Canada, I can say that many see it the same was as described in the video.  In addition, our close ties mean that many Canadians can't go to their American cottages/properties or see their American friends and family (and vice versa).   We love you and fear for you."
2020-07-27 23:33:15,"If only Trump supporters knew about the lives of middle-class people in other countries. That's information that is free and easily accessible to most, no passport or travel required. And yet, instead of informing themselves of the possibilities and voting for change, they seem content to expect nothing but the chance to try to briefly prop themselves up with racism and misogyny. Whatever happened to wanting one's children to have a better life and more opportunities? 

I'm reminded of what Eleanor Roosevelt said: ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent"". Why do so many Republicans feel so inferior? Who lowered their self-respect, education and standards?"

2020-07-28 00:02:53,"Living abroad I appreciate the compassion many have for the US.  However, the US is not doing as poorly on things directly related to the virus, as truth be told, it could be considering its dysfunctional government, lack of healthcare, poor public hygiene, level of obesity, etc.  To clarify, I am not of the opinion that the US population or government is handling the issue well - I'm very happy to be living elsewhere. But, I feel this portrayal as least slightly misleading.

The US has conducted more tests per capita of its population than all of Europe with the exception of Iceland, Luxemburg, the UK, Denmark, and Lithuania. It's also tested more than Canada, Australia, and all of Asia with the exception of Singapore.  If testing was a path towards a solution, the US is making a very solid effort.

In terms of deaths per capita, it's again doing better than Belgium, the UK, France, Italy, Sweden, and Spain.  We really don't fully understand why these nations are so badly affected.  Likely, a variety of reasons, but it doesn't seem to be mainly the governments response with few exceptions.  

Believe me, I don't see those points as indicative of an effective popular response.  But, the media have politicized this virus and the response as much as possible in the US - making it more difficult to coordinate and implement an effective response."
2020-07-28 00:09:19,Perhaps some of these young people could petition their governments to apply sanctions to the US until it’s’ government can behave responsibly towards its’ citizens and the world.

2020-07-27 18:18:29,"I read the NYTimes everyday and I knew it had a liberal/progressive bent but until I saw this video, I never realized the bend is really the knee to chest Fowler position.  You compare a country with 330 million people to countries, which at most are 1/3 our size in population?  Who are mostly homogeneous in their racial/ethnic makeup.  Who, for the most part, are protected and defended by the USA’s military.  That’s who we should listen to?  Millions of people come to the USA to get educated and to work...are millions of people emigrating to Denmark? Or Bulgaria?   The people on the video, by their own admission, believe that their healthcare and education are free... they repeatedly said the stuff was free.  We are not children.  Neither healthcare nor education is free.  Somebody is footing the bill.  Maybe those on the video aren’t paying but somebody is...the difference between here and there...the somebody who is paying is you."
2020-07-27 19:08:55,"No one can fool these young people and that is great. They all recognize that their home country, no matter how humble, has done a better job of handling the coronavirus outbreak than the US. 

Next they must ask themselves, if America cannot manage the coronavirus, what else are they mismanaging? No doubt one could fairly quickly come up with a laundry list of problems, problems that may be promptly dealt with in their home country.

Ultimately the question must become why anyone would want to relocate to the US by whatever means (student visa, chain migration, etc.) in the first place? Or if already here, why stay?  I believe one speaker compared us to the Third World. Do you really want to risk your life in a nation that handled the outbreak worse than Senegal or Jordan? The young people have laid out the facts about the US and I am grateful that the NYT is helping these modern day Paul Reveres to spread the word."
2020-07-27 21:16:35,"Once again the Times is repeating the trope that the  U.S. ""leads the world in Covid-19 deaths,"" instead of using the deaths per 100,000 population that tell a different story: Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden and France -- among others -- all have had a higher death rate per 100,000 pop than the US (although we are catching up to Sweden and France at the moment.)

 <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality"" target=""_blank"">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a>

In addition, some of the most populous countries, e.g. India, China, Russia, Brazil, are not known for accurate and honest public health data and are likely to be under=reporting their deaths. While many of the observations in this story may be correct, its credibility is ruined by the misleading lede."
2020-07-27 23:22:15,"Forgive me, like you, I have a lot on my mind.  I'm old.  But I'm very optimistic--for this reason.  I have great faith in all the very smart, socially-minded, vigilant people in the USA, including all those in what Trump and his cult call ""the dishonest, fake news media"" like the NYT.  Thank Zeus for all of them, all the investigators, all the reporters, all the truth seekers, the great number of media, print, electronic, the ACLU, all the watchdogs, the FBI and Intelligence, IG's, Dems in congress--there are so many to thank and to support and, because of all of them, I know full well, the country of The Majority is going to prevail, in the end.  The USA is worth saving and worth fighting for and worth not giving up on.  In fact, double down.  The rest of the world is depending on us.  They're on our side.  I don't mean to rant and preach.  But I don't want to buy the farm with the country as it now is.  Do it for me!!"

2020-07-28 00:26:41,"Here I think is the key to turn things around in the United States: 

Democrats must convince voters that our poor outcome is the result of these individualist-thinking Republican politicians (as Krugman writes today), who are all about self responsibility over social responsibility. Then they must highlight that countries poor and rich around the world have eclipsed our response to the pandemic, and attach that shame to the Republican politicians (president, senators, governors) who led them astray, thinking they could still live life as normal during a pandemic. 

They could bury the Republican party for decades if they could learn how to use their words. Will they?"

Our Constitution is an anachronistic document. Though it contains many concepts of government that transcend history some of the details are not only outdated but self destructive. 
Eventually a very brave leader will have to propose a terrifying, but necessary, change to the precepts that typify our traditional structures."

While we may never get back to the high esteem that Obama had,  I do believe one of the first items Biden and his administration will set is to get back into the global community and work together with our allies. Not re-electing 45 will go a long way to show that America is turning the corner. Given the fact that Trump still has a 45% shot at winning, I'd still be leery if I were overseas."
2020-07-27 20:21:50,"As bad at we look across the world, there is no shortage of  people waiting 20 plus years to come here. Our economy was booming until the virus. Then it came back very fast as soon as we started to open up again. If the Trump administration was making all these mistakes back then and it was so obvious, the media should have used their position to tell the US what to do, rather than play arm chair quarterback later. Think about it....the numbers are much higher now because they are testing now, before they were testing at hospitals, now there is drive thru testing across the country.

I tell myself that this is what happens when you elect a racist narcissist sexual predator Confederate as President more than 100 years after the supposed end of the Civil War. 

He wants to continue that war, to keep up divided. 

Where is our Lincoln? 
Who will finally unite us?"
2020-07-28 00:29:16,My son lives in Da Nang which just asked all tourist to leave the city due to one case of COVID (their first in 100 days).  They are locking down again in the city. The rest of the world wants nothing to do with us. Let's hope they all feel different come January 2021.
2020-07-28 00:29:57,"Does no one in our country see that a young woman from South Korea was reduced to tears upon learning that the U.S. death toll has nearly reached 150,000...but there have been no such expressions of sadness and caring by the people in the GOP & WH?  Why isn’t there outrage at the lack of outrage and lack of human empathy from our elected officials?"
2020-07-28 00:25:28,But any of those kids can come to the USA and buy all they guns they want.  What other country will do that?  Besides Afghan or Ethiopia.
2020-07-28 00:57:25,"Although Japan has its own set of problems and serious societal ills, I recall a Japanese colleague (of Korean extraction, which is important) mentioning to me a few years ago how a lot of Japanese view the US as a sort of ""slave society"".

This is not a new idea. Maintaining a permanent underclass, keeping people ignorant through poor K-12 education, etc. Lewis Lapham writes about it in his ""The Servant Problem"" essay - free to read.

 Some 12% of adults cannot meet an unexpected $400 expense, and for another 12%, if they did incur the expense and pay it off, they would not be able to cover their next month's basic expenses (rent, utilities, etc.), per the FRB's May 2019 Report of the Well-Being of US Households. 

So you have 24% of adults who are the effective underclass. They have little to no room to maneuver - other than, for some, moving back into mom and dad's basement.

A pretty sad state of affairs for the wealthiest and most powerful country on the planet."

This 'freedom' could be respected when the country was largely empty.  But with 330 million people, that absolute right is no longer realistic.  The Frontier is long gone, despite what many may think. 
We act like our behavior does not have worldwide consequences, but the world grows tired of our Big Frontier thinking."
2020-07-28 01:13:53,"In many parts of the world the United States has been feared for years because of its saber rattling.

In many parts of the world the United States has been resented for years because of its air of superiority.

In many parts of the world the United States has been envied for it riches and its freedom.

In very few, if any, parts of the world was the United States ever ridiculed for its ineptitude -- until Donald Trump came along."
2020-07-28 01:15:39,"I remember the rocket launches in grade school when the black and white TV was rolled in:

2020-07-28 01:18:42,"This video is very well made and powerful.  Bravo.

However, although the US response is disastrous, I do think it's slightly misrepresenting a few things.  For example, we have unemployment payments, so the $1200 Economic Impact Payment is not the only payment many are getting from the government.  I'm sure with unemployment payments we are still giving far less than most wealthy countries, and I know coverage is spotty, so it would be interesting to see an apples to apples comparison."
2020-07-28 01:21:38,"Having lived in New Zealand for nearly 20 years I now, especially over the past four years am much more skeptical of the ""American experiment"".  Yes, I call the USA my home but New Zealand is also my home. When I look back at the forty years I lived in the USA and compare it to my time here I feel a deep sense of lost potential.  It has become a nation that tears itself apart over trivial matters and ignores those material matters that will determine its viability over the long term. Its view is as short-term as the shelf life of a gallon of milk. It sheds and debases itself with a level of ignorance that is only exceeded by its ""leader"". Change though is a constant and hope is not lost.  

The USA must look to the long term and make sacrifices that can only come from a viewpoint that all must have voices that all are heard and understood, that fear is not the currency of a nation that strives for survival, that education is its blood, that division and parsing cannot unite, that lies are an insult, that insults are an affront to unity. A nation must, like a row boat in action, have both oars working in unison to move forward. If the right or left oar is employed too strongly the boat just goes around in circles."
2020-07-28 01:22:59,"The Year of the Plague, by Daniel Defoe, was written in 1722 about the plague that seeped through London in 1665.   Defoe makes some points, regarding the onset of the plague, that are parallel with today'sproclivity to lie and be in denial.   Initially, the government kept things secret by not telling the truth about the mounting statistics related to plague deaths.   Those in power pretended that people were dying from some other reason, not the plague, and the citizens wanted to believe what they were being told - until they came to see for themselves that it was the plague:
Quoting Defoe:

""But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true...""
""... the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St Giles’s parish more than usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town, and that many had died of it, though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible.""
 In Defoe's description, the people were initially told that the disease was not on the loose.  

Without honesty emanating from our government, we must find other means to figure things out for ourselves."
2020-07-28 01:23:23,"I'm in Thailand, population 70 million. There have been 58 deaths and no new cases for 7 weeks. Thailand shut down tight end of February and only reopened a month ago with the exception of bars which remain shut. 

Every single Thai wore a mask and practiced social distancing and any groups that gathered with 5 or more people were arrested.

Thais took Covid 19 seriously. Americans do not. The result is clear. Thai people just don't understand how America could have failed so badly to control the epidemic. I don't either."
2020-07-28 01:32:16,"We're plagued by a political virus passed from person to person. Trump is a symptom, intensified by GOP/FOX State Media. 
It's worsened by politicians who ask for our votes, but work for wealthy mega donors to get campaign funding. 

Much donor money must pay our media for high cost campaign ads inundating voters.  

So the media often shares in the profits of our big money political system. So how much objective discussion of reforms can we get?  We never see talk about the drive for campaign finance reform. Most voters want to reverse the Citizens United decision that helped to disunite the nation. 

Wiki says many countries ban paid political ads on media, that are our biggest campaign expense. Thus the political information their voters get isn't kept within limits set by big donors for their advantage. 

Our media gives us no information on how financing of  universal health care has worked in dozens of countries since 20th C. Here it's kept a high profit service.   

Our political virus infection weakens political representation for the average citizen. What is the antidote, the vaccine, that will bring us to political health?  The cures are painted as big govt regulation of American Freedom.  

Comparisons show we're backward as a democracy. Abroad, no one losing a job loses HC. Here 5.4 million Americans just lost insurance with job loss. Who pays for treatment if they get Covid from people who refuse masks? Who pays for gun shot treatment? But they're 'free'?"
2020-07-28 01:32:47,And Biden will be a step back to the past government where a feel good President isn’t going to change the dynamic that the political system we have is dysfunctional and broken and the next Trump will be even worse than what we have now.
2020-07-28 00:49:34,"The world is laughing at us. The world is crying for us. The world is pitying us. The world is frustrated that we can't excise the demon in the White House. The world is afraid that we won't be able to on November 3rd. Parts of the world have bashed the US for years, but this is different; the world is completely freaked out over our meltdown.

And so are most of us."
2020-07-28 00:52:29,"“Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.” - JFK speech, of course.

The apparent complete reversal of this principle has become endemic within the USA (and to a lesser, but equally harmful extent, in Australia....we aren't immune to it). 
 
Trump has merely exploited this reversal for his own benefit, thereby setting the example beautifully.  

However, here in Australia, glimmers of hope for the counter-reversal are rising; and any reading of the NYT, WP, and forums such as this confirm a similar counter-reversal is rising across the USA."

One can only hope and pray that a November election will send the most corrupt American president and his craven Senate Republicans packing. The US is hurting now. Let the world look forward to that nation rejoining its democratic friends around the world with health care for all, respect for the environment and indigenous peoples, true racial and gender equality, and a fairer electoral system."

2020-07-28 01:34:31,"1. America-bashing never goes out of fashion. I agree, it is well deserved. Would we all feel comfortable doing this exercise showing video of failed policies or moments in history in other countries? Yes, we all watch these videos of failed times across the globe (e.g. the Holocaust). We don't turn our reactions into news stories like this. This is disgraceful.

2. I do not support Trump nor his failed policies, nor rhetoric. He is ignorant, he is a total failure. Our country has shown its ignorance, selfishness, and failed health care system.

3. You can't trust numbers coming out of China, and we probably shouldn't draw many comparisons between the US and China in general, including with regard to social controls put into place to control the pandemic. Concerned about police brutality and the feds in Portland? Try living in China, you may be unpleasantly surprised.

4. I don't really care what a bunch of random foreign 20-somethings think of the US. This isn't their country, it's ours. At least half of America feels the same way about all of this. Lest you think I'm uneducated or haven't been to other countries, I'm multi-lingual and have lived on 3 continents. I just don't care at all what these people think, I care what I think and what Americans think of our failed policies. I would not turn my comments or reactions to other countries' failures into a national news story."

Now I kook at the University of Washington model projecting 200,000+ US deaths by November 1. Then I hear Trump's press briefing today in which he claims he is protecting us from other countries that are all doing much worse than the US. To top it off, he again tells younger people they have nothing to fear because it won't harm younger people -- thus ensuring more crowded partying and more younger adults hospitalized and dying."
2020-07-28 01:21:15,"The cruelty above all else is stunning. Trump and Republican Congresspeople deserve to hear a resounding NO MORE to what all Americans have suffered. A two month national lock-down still makes more sense than half-baked, non-starter ideas from the WH. 

Worried people won't work? Jobs are disappearing daily. Please stop insulting us.

The world should be aghast. Republican greed knows no boundaries, even during a pandemic amidst death and economic devastation. They are truly beneath contempt."

Getting rid of Trump is just the beginning, we need to get rid of Republicanism that provided Trump his flat-earth believing platform. November 3rd must be a day that will return the Senate back to the adults in the room and we need to keep winning elections to get supermajorities and work to get the constitution amended to be Trump-proof."

And it is the most unhealthy. We have the most guns and largest military. But we live shorter lives than a lot of nations. And while we live our shorter lives we have more diseases."
2020-07-28 00:14:07,"There's no doubt that having a person like Trump leading the nation has made this situation a lot worse than what it should be.  And it's hard to look at the data and not cringe in horror.  But US bashing has been a popular sport before Trump and COVID, and the majority of people in this video look way too gleeful about promoting a tarnished view of the US.  What else do you expect other than people's shocked responses when you put data like this in front of them.  This video struck me as taking an easy shot at the US."

1) NYT providing biased ""leading"" info to the viewers. Where are the pictures of lockdown in the NE that led to flattening the curve? Sure, the selected pictures are probably representative of many parts of the country, but definitely not all. Be that as it may, I'll not gripe much over it. 
2) All societies tradeoff between individual freedom and collective responsibility. All fall at different places on this continuum. The old world is closer to the collective-side of the continuum, while new world is on its opposite-side. In the US, we have traditionally attracted the most opportunistic people from everywhere in the world; even those who were lost souls in their own collectivistic lands. On 9 days out of 10, that's a good thing. That's why we have the most and the best entrepreneurs and the most dynamic capitalistic economy. 
3) However, there is trade offs. Pandemic, but even before pandemic, the events in last 10 or so years, have exposed our weaknesses in full glare. There is rarely pure evil and pure good. Communism was bad for those who lived through it or those who suffered its consequences. It was, however, good for us. Its threat kept our worst instincts in check. Its threat kept unabashed capitalism in check. It softened the worst features of capitalism.  (Part 2 follows as a separate comment)"
2020-07-30 10:38:30,"With virus outbreaks spiking again should we do this right now? Even if we assumed that no one would be released & go out & get revenge, how do you do this, so the virus is not spread around by newly released prisoners with perhaps nowhere to go? You'd need to isolate them for 2-3 weeks somewhere first. But where? There're no jobs for them. How will they live? We don't have the resources right now to support this - in any way shape or form. This is a recipe for disaster & puts a lot of people who are already under extreme stress due to economic adversity, unusual living situations, health hardships into an unmanageable situation. Releasing convicted prisoners from jails at this point makes no sense. Will people die as a result? Maybe. Is it worth endangering the lives of others to try to avoid this outcome? No. Some advocates of prison reform have even called for releasing violent offenders. I find it very concerning that prison reform advocates are finally admitting their endgame - the release of everyone, public safety notwithstanding. The fact that some progressives have tried to leverage a pandemic that will kill thousands of vulnerable people, is disturbing, to say the least, but consistent with their ideology. This is a crisis. There has to be a place for sensible thinking. We better be careful about releasing inmates or we could ignite a crime wave to run alongside the pandemic. Bottom line: criminals who have no resources will pose a serious threat to our communities."
2020-07-30 11:09:03,"This bill has my reluctant backing ( I live a few miles from New Jersey) with any concerns outweighed by the humanitarian crisis COVID has caused in our prisons. I also found this encouraging: 

“The bill earned unanimous bipartisan support during a Senate committee hearing, and has won backing from key lawmakers...”

My question is will these prisoners be tested before being released? The last thing we want to do is infect the outside population due to a desire to release a few thousand prisoners, who have shown they are incapable of living in a free society. Further, is it ethical to distribute 3000 plus tests to prisoners, when it is so difficult to obtain one on the outside?

It seems unjust that professional sports leagues and prisoners have ready access to testing when the average American does not. 

Despite these reservations, I support this bill."
2020-07-30 11:15:02,"Prison reform is long overdue; this is one way to get it. But just like the oil and gas industry which needs significant overhaul, to turn towards green energy, the prison industry at least in upper NYS is a significant source of jobs. Many prisons are half empty now, but closing them would send these areas into an economic depression. Our tax dollars would be better spent on drug rehab, and helping inmates re-enter society."

2020-07-30 11:21:50,This is a huge failure by NJ government. This level of deaths did not happen in local federal prisons. They are at fault for now needing to release murderers.
2020-07-30 11:09:18,"Before getting all weepy for Mr. Brian Clements and his inability to be immediately released, know something about what he did. He killed a person while driving drunk, ran over a 52 yo woman, then sped off instead of seeing if he could help. He was sentenced to 13 years, of which he could be expected to serve about 8. It was, for all intents and purposes, murder. By all means let the non-violent out according to the rules in place, and make the prisons as safe as can be, but I won’t be wringing my hands for Mr. Clements."
2020-07-30 10:47:53,"Releasing thousands of prisoners into a jobless market, defunding the police, plus millions of Americans about to join the homeless population when the evictions start.  What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-07-30 12:39:52,I fully support this as a small step towards winding down mass incarceration and out of humanitarian values. The public needs to be prepared to accept that this may lead to a small increase in crime (although short term counter evidence can be seen in ACLU’s most recent study of covid decarceration) in these circumstances and to accept that that small increase is less reprehensible than the continuation of mass incarceration. This increase might be moderated by large investments in post-release support.
2020-07-30 12:55:27,"NJ could have focused on maintaining jails safe from the virus. The inmates did not bring it inside with them but rather prison employees, vendors and prisoner visitors did so. Now the fix is to release all sorts of prisoners including those with violent histories such as murder. It's amazing of the timing of all this, it's almost as if NJ Pols have their heads in the sand. Did they not witness the major looting of commercial store fronts in NYC and the runaway violent crime stats from there since the Mayor released thousand of criminals from Rikers Island? It was Christmas in the best sense for these criminals in a city which Mayor DeBlasio prevented his NYPD from taking action against looters and street crime. Now NJ wants to follow this model? I can only speculate that the tristate area will see a big rise in illegal guns being purchased by the public to defend one's self, family and property - the constitution will support that action when that time comes in court."
2020-07-30 12:57:12,What happens when we release thousands of criminals into the worst economy we've had since the Great Depression?
2020-07-30 13:05:54,"This will be an interesting exercise in both compassion and enlightened self-interest.

Without a doubt, prisons are already becoming Covid ""hot spots"" infecting both inmates and corrections officials in ever-rising numbers.

Early release of prisoners who are close to completing their original sentences makes sense both to protect them from infection and to (hopefully) prevent them from become ""spreaders"" upon release.

As contagion rates increase in prisons -- more and more releasees are likely to be already infected.  If NJ (and other states) can reduce this ""spreader"" risk by modestly shortening the original prison sentences it can mitigate so some degree the likelihood that the releasee is a ""carrier"".

So, in other words, while such an early release clearly benefits the convict -- it also helps society by reducing the ""spreader risk"" to some degree.

As to the ""risks"" to society of an early release -- consider the fact that letting someone out after serving 19 years of a 20 year sentence is not exactly a big concession.  It's simply a small expression of compassion with a potentially large benefit to greater society."
2020-07-30 13:12:45,"""A Republican who voted against the bill in an Assembly committee, Christopher P. DePhillips, said he was sympathetic to the significant challenges facing prisoners in the middle of a pandemic""

No, he was not sympathetic.  Not one iota.  What Mr. DePhillips is really concerned about is the voters who supported him and who believe that incarcerating people forever even when facing imminent danger from a virulent pandemic, is more important than the lives of the men and women who remain in prison.

Republicans clearly have different values than Democrats. They have values driven by ultra-conservative Christian-Judeo religious beliefs.  In reality what that mean is they harbor deep feelings for continuous punishment and retribution for even non-violent crimes and offenses.  

This is the same Republican Party that supports the president who publicly disdains science and who also seeks to publicly undermine the science of the people who are charged with protecting public safety.  

Republicans don't care if Americans die of Coronavirus in prison, at home, in school or on the job.  They believe wearing a mask is a choice and your right to take discredited, dangerous and ineffective drugs cannot be impinged.  

Republicans need to sit down and really think about where they are taking Americans and the toll their actions are taking. More than  150,000 Americans are dead as of yesterday. How many more will it take to wake up Republicans? How many more Republicans?  Tell us."
2020-07-30 13:14:45,"Time to err on the side of compassion and free these fellow Americans or keep them safe.
    How many are  not in prison who should be and for worse crimes.  I can think of quite a few in this administration and they are being tested everyday so they stay alive to do more harm and allow more of their fellow Americans to die. What happened to ""justice for all"" ?"
2020-07-30 12:20:13,"The assumption among some who comment is that those released will go out and immediately commit more crimes. That may or may not be true; there is no evidence either way. It does beg the question, however, as to why those with the lowest reoffense rate of all, except those who commit murder, are as a class not allowed this potentially life-saving move. The reoffense rate for those with sexual convictions is extremely low, much lower than that for those whose convictions were for theft or for drug related offenses. Is the sub-text here a feeling that anyone who commits a sexual crime deserves to die of Covid? Does that include the 19 year-old convicted for consensual sex with his 15 year-old girlfriend? Or those who were innocent and wrongly convicted, and be assured that there are some. Some murderers are being released. Is having some drunk guy grab your boob in a bar really worse than being killed?"
2020-07-30 12:17:47,Why do I have a feeling this won't end well.
2020-07-30 13:08:32,"And we wonder why there has been a crime spike. Releasing prisoners into the community is as foolish as placing Covid19 patients in nursing homes. Feeling based policies like this one are irrational and ultimately destructive. We will pay—in some places are already paying, for releasing prisoners."
2020-07-30 12:43:58,"The USA have by far the highest incarceration rate in the world.
8 times superior to the European average , per 100 k population.
France, Germany, Italy's rate is 80/100 people in jail per 100 K .
Way too many,
Northern European nations have 40/50 .
The UK, a capitalist economy with high social inequalities and low benefits is at 140/150.
50 % higher than the European average.

With a violent crime rate also 8 times superior."
2020-07-30 12:45:59,"Thank you, New Jersey Democrats for another epic failure to protect your law-abiding, tax-paying citizens. All the high cost and political insanity of living in New York, without any of the benefits."
2020-07-30 12:57:00,"I hope they think this through carefully. Corrections often informs victims or their families in advance of a serious criminal's release. Imagine running into your child's murderer or the person who beat you - when you thought they were still in prison. They better let people know, so they can avoid retaliation. New Jersey's restrictive gun laws definitely make it hard to legally protect yourself. And the police under Gov Murphy are now basically useless. Perhaps victims, witnesses, and their families should move to Pennsylvania, where they can adequately arm and protect themselves."
2020-07-30 13:25:53,"Does anyone remember Willie Horton? The release of violent offenders - including Mr. Clements - will lead to more violent deaths. Probably very few, but definitely not zero. And you can pretty much guarantee that hard-right politicians will be falling all over themselves to exploit that in future election cycles. Yes, there should be humanitarian releases, but this must be done carefully and for non-violent offenders. Lowering prison density can be done by releasing the excessive numbers of non-violent offenders imprisoned over the years, especially men of color who have been disproportionately imprisoned over the last several decades."
2020-07-30 13:43:09,"I urge all readers to circle back to the second paragraph of this article and read it again and again: these are not indiscriminate purging of prisons like the fear-mongering comments I am reading here. These are men and women who have put their time in and earned their rights back and are already scheduled for release *within one year*. The agreement with them when they were convicted of their crime was for time served - not one individual was given a death sentence, and we have an obligation to do what we can to honor that agreement, including not allowing them to die in law enforcement custody from COVID-19. Society is no more or less at risk whether these individuals were to be released a year from now or a month from now, but these citizens and the officers assigned to watch them *are* at substantial personal risk if they are kept locked up."
2020-07-30 13:53:24,"Nobody convicted of a crime involving violence should be released early. Sentences in a liberal state like NJ tend to be too short anyway. In the case of non-violent offenders, I have no objection to early release - it makes sense and is compassionate."
2020-07-30 13:55:58,"I am surprised to see so many negative comments here.

The question is: does the risk of letting a person out one year early outweigh the risk of that person dying from coronavirus during his last year in prison.  

It is true that any prisoner upon release has a percentage risk of re-offending.  Should we therefore lock them all up for life?

These are people just like we are people.  Crowded prison conditions makes their chance of dying from CV19 very high and I hope we can all agree that they should not be ""thrown to the wolves"".  They do not deserve to die in prison.  What can be done to protect them?

The New Jersey plan seems an excellent compromise.  It helps diminish overcrowding among the remaining inmates and frees people who have served most of their time already.  It is so often utterly arbitrary in the first place whether a person receives a 7.5 year sentence or a 6.5 year sentence.

Is there some risk to the public?  Yes.  But the risk of having many prisoners die from CV19 is much greater."
2020-07-30 13:57:13,"New Jersey actually has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the US, as does New York.

Which states are the highest?  All of them are in the sun belt:
OK, LA, MS, GA, AL, AR, TX, AZ, KY, MO, NM, TN, FL

However, I support this measure.  This will make it easier to control COVID in our prisons.

Furthermore, home confinement is easy to implement with GPS ankle bracelets."

America is living in a bizarro universe. Makes one's head spin."
2020-07-30 13:49:18,so prisons are too dangerous for the inmates because of covid but schools are safe?
2020-07-30 14:20:29,"People are not in prison out of injustice or to kill them or anything else.  They are there for having committed crimes.  It is insane to release convicts on to the streets.  Americans rightly should demand law and order, not jailhouse amnesty."
2020-07-30 13:25:08,"This is a necessary but too-small step coming way too late. The fact that it’s taken months and months of negligence and death in DOCs across the country (plus immigration detention centers and juvenile facilities) shows just how little Americans care about incarcerated people. You can see it in the comments, people  blithely spouting the same cliches about “criminals” and crime upticks. Go learn about what the criminal justice system actually is instead of listening to racist law-and-order dogwhistling. Go talk to survivors of harm and see if they’re really so gung-ho about incarcerating the people who harmed them. Read “The New Jim Crow,” read “Are Prisons Obsolete?,” read about transformative justice. This entire system has to go. Incarcerated lives are not disposable."

The vast majority of those with such an offense are non-violent and will remain first time offenders. The data is there that such offenders are the least likely to re-offend but we've created such a false stereo-type that most politicians are too afraid to treat this class fairly although they know the truth. Most would be amazed to know how many seemingly benign things will get you labeled as a sex offender. Only a very very small percentage actually have done something terrible. Nevertheless, if their time is almost up... does staying a few more months really make a difference. Everyone, regardless of their offense, should be evaluated as an individuals and release based on their own personal merits, not a generalized offense category."
2020-07-30 17:11:23,"When a crime is committed by someone who is let out, who will take responsibility and there needs to be a penalty to deter such actions. 

I will suggest Whomever approves letting them out, needs to answer to the families that have lost their loved ones and offenders penalty be doubled, by law. I think we need judges and the folks at prison that let them out, need to have someone in their immediate family Lost, so they can feel the effect of what they are doing/judging. In my opinion, prison reform don't work as we seen 100's of repeat offenders, yet they live in prison and we loose our loved ones. The justice system doesn't work."

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study. I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as much as possible. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers and staff. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's no longer about competition, it's now about survival and wellness.

Some of those ""red state"" unemployed will be the result of the roll-back or the reopenings and probable reinstatement of the stay-at-home orders. One of the reasons for the original extra $600 in unemployment was that we did not want people going out and looking for new jobs and going on interviews, since the more people interact, the greater the spread of the virus.

Those unemployed have a much lower savings rate than those employed. Thus, taking a dollar away from an unemployed person should reduce net GDP, even if a dollar is simultaneously given to an employed person. In addition to the higher marginal propensity to consume of the unemployed, there is also the impact of what the unemployed are spending the extra weekly $600 on, as compared with what employed individuals would do with extra money. In particular, it is important what the unemployed will stop paying for, when the $600 per week ends.

The 2008 financial crisis demonstrates that when a substantial number of people stop paying their mortgages and other debts, there can be very serious ramifications for the financial system and thus for the entire economy...""

Republicans think they are clever trying to force people back to work - the reality is there are few jobs available - so what will happen is that landlords will go bankrupt, car loans, mortgages and credit card debts will go unpaid and within a short space of time we will have a full blown banking crisis.

This is a big concern as there are large numbers of workers who ordinarily work in casual and informal work arrangements, and these hard-working and entrepreneurial citizens are often financially vulnerable.  Do any of the current proposals include a continuation of this expansion?"
2020-07-29 19:49:51,"During the Great Recession, high unemployment dragged on for a long time. It was hoped that the present situation would be short-lived, though that seems less and less likely. No doubt circumstances differ. But in the most important way, they are the same:  being out of work is being out of work and loss of income is loss of income. 

During the Great Recession, there were no supplements to unemployment and nobody got hit like the poor. The good news was that unemployment compensation was extended for two years, the bad news was that millions of poor barely got by. And the news in print back then was that Obama was the great savior. 

Now, as high unemployment drags on, the tale of suffering due to insufferable unemployment compensation is finally being told. The potential suffering is, at the least, heartless, and at the worst cruel. 

The truth is that living off of unemployment caused great suffering in 2008 and it will in 2020. And praising Obama while attacking the Republicans for the same policies is inconsistent. 

I predict replies making all kinds of distinctions and none will be from anyone who had to live on unemployment under Obama for all 99 of those gut wrenching weeks."

2020-07-29 19:55:29,"If the republicans had followed the advice of pandemic experts, the push to extend unemployment benefits might not have been necessary.

Isn't it so typical of the republicans?  They create a problem and then they are unwilling to pay the price for their folly.  For example, the republicans rail on and on about small government as a solution for the corruption of government by the republicans and their wealthy owners.  The real solution is to let government do it's job without the corrupting influence of big money in politics."

Our economy will be suffering long lasting with the huge increase in bankruptcies, foreclosures and destitution.  Even if there is a significant change in leadership, it will be a very tall order to get things back on track."
2020-07-29 20:02:04,"$600 a week may seem reasonable to those in high cost of living areas, but in the midwest and south and most western states it is much too high.  For instance, in addition to the $600, Missouri’s unemployment benefits of $300 brought their income to $900 a week. Now employers cannot find workers because the unemployed are making more staying home.
Unemployment benefits should have been calculated on pre-Covid earnings and costs of living.
It was a disastrous formula, or lack of formula, from the beginning."
2020-07-29 20:04:45,"What is $600 to a typical well off republican?  The cost of a pair of shoes?  A nice dinner out for four (if you don’t get expensive wine)? It will just about cover two nights at Trump’s DC hotel (not including taxes).  Maybe a round of golf for one at Pebble Beach?  If you want to take a friend it will cover you at Doral, maybe. But, no, it won’t go too far at Mar a Lago.  For that you’d need to rob a bank, or at least, fleece a lot of people. 
So.  Is it any wonder that republicans absolutely cannot fathom that a measly $600 can make or break a working person’s life?"
2020-07-29 20:05:02,"A government for the economy cannot be at the same time a government for the people.

Without massive government investment into the well being of the body politic, be it in businesses, schools, families, etc, the subsequent rounds of the virus and re-closings promise to cripple the economy in far worse fashion than the original shutdown.

This country can afford the necessary financial support and ultimately the economy will recover once the virus is defeated through expensive, disciplined actions by the leaders of this country as well as self sacrifice by all peoples of this nation."
2020-07-29 20:14:51,"We can afford to keep the lifesaving amount ( for so many) at $600.

Rather than supply Americans the financial lifeline they so desperately need, they resort to baseless claims that the economy will suffer further damage if this support continues because people will “choose” to stay at home and not work. Indeed, there are definitely people who would rather laze around with a pint of Ben & Jerry's and watch Ellen and monster trucks, but not one source has provided data suggesting their numbers are significant. Yet the right continues with its baseless calumnies against those working people who would rather “choose” not to place their health and that of their loved ones in jeopardy. 

Forcing people back to work by threatening them with homelessness and hunger Is not only heartless, it is a breathtaking display of an ignorant, mean-spirited sanctimony that will further exacerbate the spread of the virus— and could well be the final nail in the coffin of our once-vibrant economy. 

This not a question of deficits, work-ethic morality, political correctness, or the moral worth of labor. It is a question of decency and human values—of which both matters are far beyond the ken of our cowardly Republican legislators."

An entirely new system costs around $5,000 on average. At $1,700 a month, three months would build an entirely new system from scratch. All the duct work. All the labor. The air unit itself. Everything. I don't understand what could have possibly gone wrong to cost that kind of money for a repair. Maybe if you replaced the entire unit with a high end HVAC. Maybe?

For my part, I don't run AC at all. We just have a swamp cooler (aka a house fan with a $30 water pump attached to a hose spigot). Temps regularly break 100 around here. Accounting for humidity, relative temps generally run about 95. The fan works fine. Much cheaper than AC too. Honestly, I would have left the AC unit broken.

2020-07-29 20:52:46,"The immediate impact of the expiration of the $600/week payments will, of course, be devastating to those who are dependent upon it for food, housing, medical care etc.

But, ironically, this misguided decision to allow such an expiration to occur will ultimately have deep negative effects upon the US economy.

Virtually everyone who was receiving this extra cash was spending it.  It's not like they were salting the money away in banks, stocks or mattresses.

This money was simply flowing through their hands and into the general economy.  In simple economic terms, this cash had a ""multiplier effect"".  It was spent at the grocer's.  The grocer in turn both stocked more goods and paid her workers their wages.  These workers then took their pay and spent it too on groceries and elsewhere.  And on and on and on.

Now, the GOP-led Senate and the Administration have conspired together to eliminate these payments.  They have cut off cash that was flowing throughout the greater economy.

The loss of that cash flow will now depress the earnings of many and result in additional reduced spending in what is essentially a moribund economy.

In these troubled times, eliminating the unemployment supplement is akin to a person engaging in self-harming.

What kind of a misguided tragedy have we embraced as a society?"

They have no desire to extend the weekly $600 enhanced unemployment benefits to workers newly unemployed by the economic lockdown. They have no money to aid distressed state and local governments. So during a raging pandemic that they have mismanaged the sufferings of millions of Americans will increase and a Great Trumpian Depression will ensue. Their cruelty is only matched by their stupidity and their folly. They are totally delusional.

Everyone likes to point out they worked their whole life, and so did I. Until 2009, when I proceeded to be out of work for 18 months among very good company--you remember former business owners ,executives, Ph.D.'s begging for any jobs they could find? Skilled, intelligent, motivated people with absolutely not an iota of job prospects for as far as the eye could see and yet not even a discussion that maybe unemployment benefits should be increased during this time. I lived in Seattle (expensive, remember) on a benefit of exactly $285/week. For 18 months. Alone. You know how far behind you fall on all financial health and stability markers when you live on that for months? And you know that you never do actually catch up? Send me retroactive $600/week benefit payments that I can put in my retirement fund and then we'll talk. I'm a bleeding heart liberal from the word Go but this is hard to stomach. Maybe some perspective would help."
2020-07-29 21:03:53,"The entire GOP rationale for this is false. $600 was decided not arbitrarily, but because it takes a national average of all weekly state unemployment benefits and adds $600 to meet the national average of unemployed workers lost weekly wages, not more. Obviously some people get more with this average, but many get less, myself among those, considerably less. Also if you refuse work, you can lose benefits altogether, so this ""disincentive"" narrative is completely false. The Republicans are, as so often they do now, peddling a cruel lie. I don't understand why there hasn't been major blowback on these points. Nobody can refuse work and collect unemployment, and for far too many of us our livelihoods simply will not return until there is a vaccine."

A lot of businesses around have ""now hiring signs"" because workers that were laid off in March do not want to go back to work and who would if you are making $2400/month plus 60% of your salary when you were making half of that before the pandemic. The hair salon I go to only has one employee ( the owner) because others that were laid off in March refuse to come back to work.

My work hours have decreased 40% since covid hit, and I've only qualified for a portion of the combo benefit 3 weeks out of 14.

First, your liquid savings is gone. It probably didn't last long. You cancel all the ""luxuries"" you can, like cable and streaming services. You sign up for an eBay account so you can start selling stuff. You start making hard choices about health insurance. When you look up COBRA, you realize just how impossible that will be.

Then comes the credit card spending. Hopefully you aren't already overextended, because there's a lot of it. Will your credit ever recover? Probably not. If you're lucky, eventually you'll be able to keep up with the interest.

Then the credit runs out. Do you have rich family? It's time to start begging.

If you don't have rich family, it's time to start looking in places you never thought you'd look. IRAs? 401(k)? What choice do you have? Of course you don't tell anyone this. You call it ""living on savings."" Everybody knows that anyone who'd dip into their 401(k) early is an idiot right?

After that? Fortunately I don't know for sure. I do know that it's tough to find a place to rent that doesn't require good credit and a deposit. Hopefully you have family who'll take you in.

All through this? Fear, shame, depression, hopelessness. You thought you mattered. Maybe you don't.

The extra $600   state unemployment was less than my monthly salary but enabled me to cover all my pared down costs. The loss of the $600 will mean drawing down my emergency fund (lucky to have one) and deferring my mortgage. I've been applying to jobs since mid April and so far nothing. I want to work! It's worrying that Congress doesn't seem to comprehend the jobs are not there to support all who want to work. Working Americans need assistance in this unprecedented time.

Doggy daycare and boarding out of my (rented) home; and 2. Pet Photography business. Both were thriving before and both are now nearly at zero due directly to Covid. I was thrilled when they opened up unemployment to the self-employed. Not sure what I would have done without it. Not sure what I’ll do now. As a 60-year-old with asthma and a genetic tumor condition (paraganglioma), I’m limited in what I can be exposed to. I’ve been looking for remote and low exposure work to no avail. 

Millions of Americans and are in similar situations. Please write your Senator and ask for an extension! This will save lives and help the economy, not to mention it’s the right thing to do for people. A once-in-a-century pandemic requires a once-in-a-century response."

Too often it seems that decisions are made by slogans rather than practical common sense."

How do you think I feel about people making almost 3 times my income when they are not working?  I've been looking for full time work for over a year and it's just not there for a man of 57.

Some excuses are legit, others are phony. Come on, for those non professional jobs, wouldn't everyone prefer to stay at home than go back to work, even if the hourly rate goes up somewhat?
I know one thing. My husband and I aren't interested in rehiring anyone who will slack off. Collecting unemployment should mean calling the old employers and asking them, are you taking workers back? If not, the federal govt. is being irresponsible in just dishing out billions that will become a new tax burden for all of us later on."
2020-07-29 21:38:50,"Going to work, as everyone knows costs every working man or woman money.  Whether it is carfare, owning a car, lunch, dry cleaning, being a working person at every level has a cost.

The Republican Senate, the White House and several red state Republican governors are directly responsible for making another large stimulus package necessary.

The reason well more than most people are not going to work is not because they are earning more by staying home but that there  is a very depressed job market, the Pandemic poses unacceptable risks and schools will need to be closed with learning done remotely.

The $600 bonus was part of a stimulus to keep the economy afloat and its success in the face of a continuing failed effort to keep the Virus at bay mandates its continuation at the $600 level.

Finally everyone living in the United States should have access to the NIOSH N95 mask ot the K N95 mask. It cost .28 each on April 10th.  The federal government ought to insure their manufacture in quantities that can service the whole country.

But not one GOP congressman has stood up for his constituents and defended their right not to go back to work and die. That is why they all have too be removed from office ASAP. And now the GOP’s answer to Trump's failure is to punish people who have watched people they know die as well as suffer alone in hospitals while attempting to further raise the stakes of hardship across the American landscape. And when you add Trump's efforts to take the ACA coverage from millions of Americans it does not take a cognitive test to tell if people are smart enough to demand justice. The GOP is not a governing body it is a dismantling body. They will kill people and destroy the environment and take pride that they are taking sides with a president who every day makes certain to all us he is not qualified to be president. If there is any justice Trump will go to prison when he is voted out of office in November. Surviving until the election and the inauguration of Biden are the challenge that I fear will swamp millions of jobless Americans, destroy our economy and send this country into a tailspin that will leave a new administration with a mountain-high to-do list to salvage what once was a great nation that the rest of the world looked to for leadership."

BTW I am an employer in MI and in MI employers pay 100% of Unemployment premiums.  Our maximum amount is 362 and has been 362 for at least 15 years.

They are absolutely right. If the GOP lets that 600$ aid expire, they are more boneheaded than previously thought. People who get it don't hoard it, they don't use it to buyback shares or buy a new country home. they spend it on rent, food, clothes, utilities and the people  and businesses who receive it pay salaries and rent and buy supplies for future sales and every dollar works up the feeding chain of the economy.

2020-07-29 22:07:57,"Unemployment benefits should be tied to the individuals earnings when they were working. The $600 was arbitrary and overly generous. many of the workers deemed ""Essential"" were working and earing less than the $600 Federal benefit plus the regular State benefit. The $600 should be pegged proportionately to the State benefit to be fair to everyone. I am sorry people are out of work due to covid-19 but I am also realizing that we can not do for one group and ignore the other. Who are the other? Essential workers and those who still have jobs and show up to work every day covid-19 or not. They use PPE and other precautions."

As I listen to people who are worried about whether or not people will return to work, I can't even imagine that this ""extra"" money would be a motivator or not. I spend my time looking for work and trying to get through the unemployment line, both which feel futile. When I hear politicians bicker about this, it feels really out of touch. There are no jobs because of this pandemic. This pandemic happened because our government failed in its initial response. There's also no childcare but people are somehow suppose to work. Every day feels like square peg, round hole. An extra $600 a week for people who get it would keep spending up in our fragile economy. My spending is your livelihood, and if you don't believe it, roll the dice, cut these benefits, and see if your job still exists in 3 months. I cut my own hair the other day. That's a small bit of money that could be in someone else's pocket, but because I don't have it, its not. Its not like I'm going to get extra haircuts later on. That is just one example, maybe one that people would consider frivolous, but there are so many examples. We are all interconnected and the sooner we get that, the better our response will be."
2020-07-29 22:11:33,"The additional $600 was incredibly helpful in staying afloat, treading water as i waited for reopenings and going back to work.  As I mapped out every situation and possibility with balancing the mortgage, utilities, car payment, home improvement loans, credit cards and so on, I was looking at almost 5k a month. All of a sudden getting roommates, renting out the house and living in the basement, selling the house... all these ideas were on the table. When one makes money, one doesn't blink at financial commitments but when there is no jobs to turn to, that additional $600 really became a godsend. 

I'm back to work now, its differentof course. I was the only server to get rehired from 13 others and I feel guilty about it. I would read of the guilt that survivors from terrible accidents said they felt and didn't really understand. """"You're alive, be thankful"" I thought but now I have a better understand it to some degree. 

Its going to be a bottle neck of people looking for work and not everyone is going to get a job right away. Those that complain from working while others get paid to stay home, dont realize that the guaranteed job is better than temporary money."
2020-07-29 22:14:48,"What will Congress do? Nada. 

The reason this Administration is opposing continuation of these benefits is because of the fact that the disproportionate share receiving these benefits reside in ""Blue"" states. As Scrooge would say, ""Let them dies (and note vote) and decrease the surplus population.""

Likewise, the House Democrats are in the ""cat bird seat;"" can hold their noses; and wait until Senate Republicans in toss-up 
re-election races force McConnell to ante up.

House Democrats should wait it out simply because most of the 25-40 million unemployed know who's holding up their extended unemployment checks. 

And trust me, in the end the Congress and the Administration will make unemployment benefits contained  in any new pandemic relief bill retroactive to the date that the benefits ended."

For those crying that some--some--people made more in unemployment than they did working, well, that fact is an indictment of how low wages are--criminally low, while CEOs take home millions, even now.  

More evidence Republicans in the federal government hate Americans - they must hate medical personnel - else why deny them lifesaving PPE?  They must hate the Americans who suffer from purveyors of pollution who damage our water and make us ill.   They refuse to act on climate change, which threatens everyone who lives on the coasts.  

They cover this hatred with sanctimonious statements that bear no resemblance to the truth.  They all have gold plated retirements and healthcare - necessities they deny to all Americans.  We are living in a society in utter collapse- a society that refuses, absolutely refuses, to take care of the basic needs of its citizens is ruled by a government that hates us, no matter what sanctimony they shovel.

I also know four highschoolers (who are currently living with their parents!) that have qualified for this money and now our banking $600 a week from the federal government.

I’m as anti GOP as they come. I’ve also been in situations where our family has been unemployed and have had to rely solely on regular unemployment benefits. Why should this be any different?

In the pandemic, more people are subsidizing or taking in relatives and friends. Those fortunate and frugal enough to have savings are depleting them, this will have longterm effects; as usual, the burdens fall disproportionally on the already disadvantaged. Republicans believe this is both the natural order and how society works. . They are wrong on all counts. Like so many bad Republican ideas, it is unsustainable. And unconscionable.

And are Ms. Mallery’s three bedrooms and a yard more important than emergency savings? Ditto Mr. Parker who spends something like 40% of his net on rent. In both cases, would it have been smarter to find a cheaper place and build emergency savings?

Best of luck to all three. But I hope they (and the 40 percent who can’t come up with $400) learns. I know not everyone can save. But considerably more people can save than do and considerably more of those who do save can save so much more.

2020-07-29 23:07:59,"I understand the Republican concern about people not wanting to return to work because they make more with the federal unemployment bonus. But that raises some other questions:

Where are all the jobs that these people should be applying to? Many businesses are still at reduced staffing, temporarily closed, or out of business. 

Should normal wages be raised to meet the cost of living?"
2020-07-29 23:19:21,"How can the GOP think that cutting the $600/week is the right thing to do at this moment?  There are not enough jobs out there.  We're right back to where we were in late 2008.  For some of us this is the 4th serious economic crisis we're living through.  For some of us the job market has never been good even if we are/were in STEM fields.  

It seems to this reader that the real issue is inadequate wages to begin with, a very poor social safety net (and an equally poor attitude towards improving it for all Americans), a wealth care system that doesn't work when we need medical care, and a corporate attitude that despises both employees and consumers in equal measure.

If we aren't making money we won't spend it.  If we don't spend it corporations can go broke.  If we have no money we can't afford housing, food, medical care, education, and since the government won't be taking in much in tax money our public spaces will rot.  Given how leisurely the GOP has been about this and other crises in the past that have affected working Americans I suppose that we should expect next to nothing.  The lesson to all Americans is this:  the GOP does not have your back at all.  They'd prefer to see you on your back and unable to get up again."
2020-07-29 23:19:28,"Mitch, I'm down with you and your buddies cutting jobless benefits to $200/week, but with a few tweaks:

1. Add a $2,000 per person per month check to every single adult American plus $500 per child. Make it taxable so you can claw it back from the rich later.

2. Put in automatic stabilizers - if unemployment stays above a certain number, the benefits automatically renew. It's not nice to keep having these fights every few months - let's avoid the unpleasantness.

3. Make Medicare available for everyone who does not have insurance. It's important people have health care during a pandemic. Note: We can tweak this later to include everybody else. You know, Medicare for all of us. We'll come up with a catchy name later.

See? Bipartisan compromise. It's possible."
2020-07-29 23:21:14,"Mitch McConnell was asked about the 2 billion dollar addition to this bill that no Republican wants to finalize.
Mitch insisted that he knew nothing about that $2,000,000,000. He even gave his wide-eyed and innocent stare, but he knows.

In this bill is a quiet inclusion of 2 billion dollars. It will re-vamp the old FBI building.
The other option is to move the offices completely to somewhere out of downtown DC (MAKE DC A STATE!).

But, if that were to happen, Donald Trump fears that someone will step in and buy the empty FBI building and turn it into a hotel.... which is what HE did to the old empty for-sale Post Office building.

He doesn't want the future competition.
This is what the Republicans are concerned about.
They don't care that Ms. Mallery and her son face ruin, they simply want to scratch each other's back and keep Donny happy.

Democrats: Don't let these people down!
I haven't a doubt that they have paid MORE in taxes than either Mitch or Trump --- but I also know that Ms. Mallery is harder-working than either of those two cruel men.

Let's put Mitch and Donny out in the 100 degree sun moving cactuses, what do you think....?"

2020-07-29 23:37:07,"I completely understand that the $600/wk is unsustainable in the long run. It was meant as an emergency measure, and it was timed because it was assumed the country would be well on the way to recovery from the pandemic by then. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case, and so millions of people like me are going to need those supplements for a little longer. 

That said, I really think there ought to be some kind of bonus for people who are working in-person essential jobs, who would have normally earned less than the $600/week. I get that many people in that position feel the supplement is unfair to them, and I think this concern should be addressed."
2020-07-29 23:38:40,"This program of handing out free money to people who’ve lost their jobs is misguided.  First, it’s unfair to people who were already unemployed and aren’t eligible for the money.  It’s unfair to recent college graduates who don’t get that money and are also unemployed.  Second, it’s unfair to working people who are still earning their paychecks.  Third, it’s unfair to future generations who will be expected to pay off this debt.  Last, it’s causing inflation which is destroying the purchasing power of our money.  I’ve been noticing that consumer prices are going way up for products I recently purchased.  I can see my Amazon.com history to know what I paid for something.  In January, I bought hair clippers for $17.59.  Today, they want $38.98 for those clippers.  I’m seeing this on so many products.  Retirees that live on fixed incomes are being hurt the most by inflation.  The government needs to stop handing out cash.  It's not right."

With the latest layoffs, more higher paying jobs are eliminated and these workers have higher consumer discretionary spent power and our leaders need to be careful with not cutting the max amount of UI benefits by a lot, if any with regards to $600.Come August, % of people that have become unemployed in these jobs will go up versus before and if these worker's majority of lost income is not replaced via viable UI for time being,  economy and businesses will suffer even more due to less spending as the % of people that has discretionary spending power will be less versus before.Hopefully it would be possible to pass a temporary extension of the expanded UI benefits of the $600.This way, millions of people don't face a huge hardship all of a sudden, regardless of their pre-pandemic income level. Until states can implement a % if wages as UI replacement, (Hopefully at 80-90% rather than the 70% proposed, if not $600), maybe a gradual decline from $600 to $500 and etc. can be implemented until states can update their UI systems. If they have a delay, the deduction can be suspended  until they can implement the new system. The difference of $400 in both proposals can be partially offset by not sending the $1200 stimulus checks to those that are working With higher wages."
2020-07-29 22:37:22,"People, including all Republicans, who oppose the $600 bonus have the attitude that workers are lazy bums.  My husband is not a lazy bum. His job not only ended because of the virus but the employer closed because of safety concerns.  When the benefit ends, there will be no job to return to. He can't find any job now.  And guess what?, if you are over 50, I bet you can't find a job either.  Not to mention if you are diabetic, have Type A blood, are older than 60, or have any other of the risk factors.  

Republicans have no plan. If a vaccine were ready tomorrow, we'd all still be broke and flailing at this point.  Their goal seems to be to force us onto breadlines."

2020-07-29 23:51:23,"We should be appalled that ""Roughly two-thirds of workers ended up with more income than they would have earned had they not lost their jobs."" $600 per week comes out to $15/hr for full time work. Compare that to the salary of a Congressperson ($174K plus generous benefits, including excellent health care and pensions). How can we call this a ""representative democracy""? How ridiculous for these millionaires to squabble over whether their fellow Americans are deserving of a sustainable wage in the face of a catastrophe. And how arrogant to assume that they know what incentivizes people to work or not—people with whom they are clearly out of touch. Maybe the $600/week should incentivize businesses to treat workers better. Congress has allowed businesses to get away with too much for too long—keeping wages so low that min wage workers qualify for food assistance, cutting hours to avoid providing benefits, employing 49 people to avoid FMLA, etc. Raise the minimum wage, and support universal health care so that unemployment does not equal loss of access to health care. The stupidity of tying health care to employment is exhausting. This pandemic is the perfect storm."

Not this time. This time, it hits home."

If they would send me a list, I know several unemployed people would be delighted to exchange them for the $600. Or if they have some work FOR the government they would like in exchange for $600, they’d be happy to do that, too. 
This obsession with the idea that the unemployed are getting away with something is really sickening."

Less than two months later the predicable raging resurgence virus began sweeping across the South and Southwestern US. McConnell awakened by the noise began to ponder another stimulus bill. 

The cause of resurgence resulted from the premature reopening of primarily red states. The disciples of Trump complied with his orders opening Florida, Texas and Arizona while he denied reality.   Blameless workers victims of criminal negligence by Trump now punished my miserly GOP senators cleaving to him.Impossible to defend creating a health crisis  then torching the economy while shafting workers.

And because of the very generous relief package, people who continue to go to work every day, in many cases, are making less than those on unemployment.  Nobody cares about them though.

2020-07-30 00:57:56,"With long term interest rates near record lows, any middle class person with a home mortgage could save a bundle on their monthly budget by refinancing their existing loan.   But the Catch 22 is, to qualify for a new loan, you must be credit worthy with a stable financial outlook.   If you have lost your job or your business has been hurt, you don't qualify for a new loan, and you are stuck paying the higher, old interest rates.

One of the greatest relief programs would be for the Federal Government to make all lenders write down the interest rates in existing loans without otherwise changing the terms.   All debtors with existing loans would benefit.   And existing creditors would not see a rise in defaults with lower monthly payments.  Indeed, one would expect the rate of defaults to only decline.

The problem would be with loans that were sold and bundled into loan portfolios and sold to investors.  But if everyone starts defaulting on unrealistically high rate existing mortgages, those investors are in trouble anyway."

His extra $600/week, plus the paltry $370/week of the max state unemployment is not more than he was making before. For people to think that those on unemployment making the extra $600/week are living the high life, it's just crazy. They're making a LIVABLE wage, which is what everyone should be fighting for. Don't punish those who have been let go because some employers are too cheap to pay living wages to their essential employees. 

On another note, I wish more people would plan for these things a little better. We bought a house that we could afford on ONE salary in case anything happened to one of our jobs or our health. We drive reasonable cars. We have a substantial savings. Looking at the cars and houses of our peers, we live WAY below our means, but can weather situations like this better. We go big on things like vacation (before the world shut us out). I know that's privilege, and impossible for some people to do. But many people live richer lifestyles than they need to so they can ""keep up with the Jones's"" and then their whole life falls apart within a month of losing a job and getting normal unemployment. We need to incorporate more education around personal finances into high school curriculum. Kids obviously won't be picking up good habits from their parents."

My son worked at a museum. He was furloughed and then laid off, along with many other people. Sure, he was collecting more than he made but not by much. And he's been job hunting with no success. Jobs in museums, the arts, the travel industry are not coming back for a long, long time.

 I'm sure there are some people who are not returning to work because they make more not working, but I don't think that's too many people. And more power to them!

I'll never forgive the Republican administration for the denial, absurdity and disrespect of science that we've seen in the last few months.

I followed the rules of NY unemployment insurance, kept a job search diary, looked for work, accepted every offer I got.

Together with the $1,700 stimulus payment ($1,200+$500), this makes roughly $10,000 of extra money she received, compared to her pre-COVID work income. 

What happened with this money? Because even if the supplemental payments really end this week, this money should help her survive normally for many more months. How come she faces immediate bankruptcy now? Why are her credit cards (note the plural) ""all maxed out"" now?

For sure, the social welfare net in the US consists mostly of holes. But could it be that financial literacy, or the lack thereof, plays a role in pushing people over the brink in such situations?

Not take away your benefit. And it should be easy. If I get unemployment payments of $800.00 but get some work, it becomes very complicated & I might loose the $800 all together. If I or another person makes say $200 one week the government should give the other $600. There should be some poverty level line that has to be met. Welfare is like that too. If you are married it counts against you. If you get a min wage job they take away the benefit. 
  I am saying this because I know people getting unemployment that have been offered a little work in their field but they are scared to take it. It is no where near what they need for a week or month. They are afraid to lose the benefit which is really helping out....  It should not be this way.  ........

All this -or most of it- I abashedly (yes, anonymous) say was a course set graduating into the 1991 recession, which established a pattern of scrounging desperately for minimum wage, mind-numbing & exhausting temp jobs.

The gist was that rather than giving the ""pandemic unemployed"" (ignoring the long term unemployed) the relative bonanza of $600 per week, = to $31,000 per year, it would be much more fair to give all adults earning less than $30,000 per year $200 or $250 per week

Congress is haggling over a measure to tide the unemployed over until the pandemic subsides, while averting economic collapse.  

The earlier CARES Act basically sold out the long-term unemployed as if we somehow deserve our economic condition more than the current cohort. As I remarked earlier, the 1991 recession was my corona pandemic, & there was no bailout then.

If the real aim is to stimulate the economy/spending, & alleviate an unsteady economy's brutality, don't callously/lazily/punitively assume the long-term unemployed are more responsible for their/our plight than the ""pandemic unemployed."" That would be to slough off the diligence that fairness & intellectual honesty require, & thus deeply hypocritical on multiple levels."

The 30 million people in receipt of this Government supplement are now very likely to be unable to pay their rent or mortgage and will become homeless. This catastrophic level of destruction, deliberately targeted upon his own people by a President, does not have any historical precedent, not even in the 1930's.

If they do not return, they can be replaced by people whose jobs have disappeared and who cannot return to work.  So businesses that want to be or stay open have no shortage of willing workers.  But if customers are scarce, they have little need or use for workers no matter how many are available.  

Under free enterprise, businesses avoid unnecessary expenses.  If they have no customers, paying workers is an unnecessary expense.  Ultimately, under free enterprise, surpluses get liquidated unless it makes economic sense to store them for future use or sale.  And surplus people are surpluses.  If they are not carried by governments, they will have to be carried by charity.  Gofundme will be very busy, and people will have to embellish their stories, perhaps hiring experts to do it.

They seem to understand neither the many reasons people want to work (job satisfaction, the importance to folks of self-sufficiency, the need to be a role model for a child, even just something to do) nor the many reasons people cannot currently work (child care, illness, transportation issues etc.). 

Sure, there are always a few who are 'lazy' and will sit on their bottoms when given the chance.

The funny thing, the GOP doesn't want to support the American people, even though it's the American people's money that they would be giving them.

It certainly isn't any of their clients money, because none of them actually pay any taxes.

It's not about fiscal policy - otherwise they wouldn't give out trillions of dollars to those who least need it every chance they get. It's about inflicting as much needless pain and suffering as possible on all those who don't walk, talk, look, act, and think like they do. That's it. That's all there is to it.

Just look at everyone of their political positions and you will find this to be the case.

Why else would they cut school lunch programs for needy children? Why else would they make those in poverty suffer as much as humanly possible? Why else would they steal children from their parents, deport those parents, and put the children in cages, while keeping no records of it?

It isn't because these people are ""breaking the law"", because Trump breaks the law every day. It's because they enjoy the thrill of inflicting pain."

Reading about the medical costs this man faces made me quite upset - America, finally come around and implement a solution for healthcare. Are you not ashamed? How do you not feel debilitating anxiety merely existing in a system where becoming ill will wreak havoc on your financial situation? It really isn't that hard to implement single payer healthcare, as evidenced by the fact that almost every other developed nation managed to do so. The problem is that you would have to swallow your pride and free yourself from the notion that the ""choice"" you have in choosing insurance is anything but a choice between the black plague and cholera."

The Democrats have a plan that has been in place since May, as I understand it. That plan is the answer to Trump's give away to corporations - it keeps the middle class afloat - barely. 

The Republicans apparently just realized they have to take meaningful action - they seem to be fumbling in the dark for action, and they will be leaving the meaningful part out of the equation.

Finally, to perpetuate the lie that workers will ""sit by the pool"" with their whopping $600 is disgraceful. Many people I know take the paycheck when they can, and save everything else when they can.

I might have more confidence applying for an essential job at a grocery store, etc. but my lack of confidence with the general public doing something as simple as wearing a face mask is low.

2020-07-30 16:57:12,"The helpful part of enhanced unemployment insurance is that state unemployment benefits do not take into account the benefits package you lost.  My wife lost her job last Friday and we are both on her health insurance.  NJ unemployment replaces 60% of wages.  We are on the face of it about even on her take home pay.  Except that we now have to pick up a $1000/mo in COBRA premiums that we weren’t paying before.

I also fail to see why it makes sense for the federal government to offer varying benefits to people.  The Republican line is that they want to target 70% wage replacement.  Well if 1 state already replaces 60% and another state only replaces 30%, why should residents of the state with the more generous benefits be penalized?"

It is wrong to just send money out to millions.  We have an IRS, everyone sends in a tax return; it's the law.  So, we know what people made and we should not pay them more.  Europe did it much better when they just gave workers 75% of what they were making to stay home.  Keeps one afloat and interested in getting back to work when the time comes.

2020-07-30 18:03:59,It's abundantly clear that many businesses can not operate due to covid.  Millions of people are unemployed since their employers can't operate.  This situation isn't going to change very soon.  The unemployed just don't have many job options.  If their unemployment insurance is cut off millions are going to be in a very desperate situation.  How are they going to buy food?  With a little more time many will face homelessness.  Medical care will be unreachable.  This scenario must be avoided.  It's way more critical to keep people living than to keep the stock market afloat by buying trillions of dollars of corporate debt.
2020-07-30 18:18:19,"I feel ambivalent about this. I think the problem is that the extra $600 would serve to benefit many individuals whose jobs are obliterated and maybe not coming back for awhile, or at least until Covid gets more contained. 

However, I have personally seen abuse of the system at my workplace. It's been a frustrating uphill battle for me to go back to work because I face so much resistance from the other employees who don't want to come back before UI ends.

I'm an associate dentist, and our office has been open a total of 6 times since mid-March. I had a feeling that we wouldn't return to normal when the office manager explicitly informed me the staff makes more off unemployment, and we wouldn't open fully until August. Meanwhile, other employees told me that we can't open because patients don't want to come in, or that we need to observe stay at home orders. On the days we have worked, my schedule is packed and filled with a backlog of emergency patients: I've seen kids with toothaches, patients who now need root canals instead of fillings or crowns, infections, broken teeth ... from March.

I've had lengthy discussions with the owner. Because of the majority of the office is so reticent on coming in, it's just easier for him to close and create good will for the employees instead of hiring a temporary set of new staff members. So until the day unemployment ends, we will not be open full time, and if UI is extended, I can definitely count on the office not opening fully."

There are some who will make more on unemployment than by returning to their jobs. But those jobs have reduced hours. Benefits may be gone. People will face a higher risk of illness.

But the highest percentage are workers who don't return to work because there is no work.

The jobs you could always count on in a pinch aren't there. 
No one needs a ride from Uber as no one is going anywhere. Waiters and Waitresses? No one is eating out. Amazon workers, maybe, but even those jobs have been filled by others in the same boat.

And if you find some part-time work somewhere, who will take care of the children or sick relatives? How will you pay for care when you make $8.00 an hour when you used to make $15 or $20 or $50 an hour?

That ""extra"" money will be used for housing. For food. For medicine. For car and insurance payments. And, yes, maybe to keep their cable connected.

For some, it will be used just to survive.

If you cut those payments you'd better have a plan. Do you want to force people to go back to work? What is your plan to have businesses be ready to open at full capacity? Will you make sure benefits can be re-instated at pre-pandemic levels? The list goes on. Where's your plan?

Many of us have fallen through the cracks, who have been for whatever reason out of the workforce before the pandemic hit. And a great many of us worked, slaved, toiled for year after year until some setback derailed us. It could be a medical situation, caring for elderly parents, burnout, or some form of impairment by others' criminality or malice. These are not unrealustic scenarios, but probably the reality for millions of people like myself. 

I've been at the margins of the economy dince graduating into the 1991 recession 3 decades ago, never recovering from the inital poverty, frustration demoralization of desperately scrounging for $7 per hour mind-numbing toil, living for years with roommates, having to appease landlords and ATT & Comed not to suspend service, having job interviews ruined because of stress, not being able to get a sweaty suit drycleaned, & often physical hunger. Turning down temp assignments for lack of busfare. That was my coronavirus in '91, and no legislation bailed me out. 

Now my counterparts are being treated to a $600 per week paid vacation because they were fortunate enough to have jobs just before the pandemic?

I don't object, but if they should get $600 per week, I should nlt be left in the dust like in the past, to put it frankly. If those elligible based on recent work history get $600 per week, I should get at least $300 just for breathing."

The US, being greatly angered that a country would dare elect a leader that did not bow to US dictates  and unregulated Capitalism,  attempted a coup in2002 that failed.
Ever since, the US has been working to destabilize Venezuela and poured money into opposition groups.
The US is like the cop with its boot on the neck of Venezuela, eager to strangle the country to death with sanctions.

In 2009, the Obama administration decided that the newly elected Honduran president Manuel Zelaya was going to put the interests of Honduran people over US business interests, and successfully engineered a coup.
Immediately after the coup, violence soared in Honduras with killings of activists and journalists, and Hondurans began leaving as refugees, seeking asylum in the US.

That is what America does to destabilize countries.

This paragraph is not accurate on three points: (1) Dominican President Danilo Medina has not “bowed out”, as he is still in power —and will step down when his mandate concludes on 16 August (when President-elect Luis Abinader will be sworn in); (2) Medina did not lose the election, as term limits prevented him from running in it (it was his favored candidate that lost); and (3) Dési Bouterse also did not run for another term in the uncontested election that elevated Cham Santokhi to the Presidency of Surinam.

The article (a) misses an opportunity to point out that the Dominican Republic held  an exemplary, competitive, and free electoral process despite the pandemic, serving as an example to all other counties in the region and, indeed, the world; and (b) the faulty research on the recent events in both the Dominican Republic and Surinam puts into question the accuracy of all other assertions made throughout.

I am deeply saddened to say that the article falls below the NYT’s standards, and fails to meet its readers’ expectations."
2020-07-29 15:45:15,"I would appreciate if the NYT stopped using the term “Latin America”; it is a eurocentric term that doesn’t take into account the languages and cultures of the indigenous and afroamerican populations. Secondly, there are 33 countries in the region and it would be correct to address their problems individually with a unique analysis."
2020-07-29 15:53:14,"Thank the “Washington Consensus”, and the Milton Friedman school of economic austerity and grift.  How can Larry Summers be “advising”  Biden on economic matters?    The 2008 Milton Friedman created financial crisis will finally destroy the global economy.   Yet, Goldman Sachs paid a couple of days ago, $3 billion dollar penalty for helping the Malaysian strong man loot billions of dollars from that country.   Goldman got billions in fees.    If, in fact, the hemisphere collapses economically, it won’t bode well for hedge fund fraudsters and their supporters."
2020-07-29 15:58:40,"The article isn't emphasizing the biggest issue with Latin America that erodes whatever elected ideology is in power; corruption. Hospitals are underfunded and in disrepair because of corruption, judges put opposition politicians in jail because of corruption, social programs or coronavirus responses are a mess because of corruption too (the US is able to overthrow governments at will for the same reason). In the united states, after all the terrible things that trump has done, almost all of it has been made possible because of corruption. We shouldn't be afraid of Venezuela because it is socialist or Brazil because it is semi-fascist, but because they are both highly corrupt across all the highest levels of government. We are becoming more like both of them everyday and our horrific pandemic response shows that more than ever."

First by having the laughably corrupt judicial system declared Correa guilty of  "" Psychic Influence "" in a sham corruption case, jailing the legitimate vice-president and then just last month eliminating his political party."

As a result, the decade of the 2020s is going to be one of the most volatile and perhaps violent in history, as we confront the dire consequences of the spectacular failure of globalization that is epitomized by the virus itself.

Democracy and Free Market Capitalism are facing existential threats around the world, regrettably, but with good reason. Both have largely failed, in the form they've been implemented for the past forty years, and both have been undermined and distorted almost beyond recognition by neoliberal economics and shareholder-driven globalization.

As the economic hardship worsens and broadens in scope in the coming months and years, the seething anger will explode into violent social unrest on a global scale.

She has closed down neighborhoods which forces folks to stay home -  are unable to go to work.  There is no legal recourse thru the courts.

She has prohibited Bogota residents from ingress or leaving the city to visit families and friends - its simply unbelievable that in free country, a citizen is stopped from free traveling their own country.

Medellin mayor has invited Cuba to provide assistance without any public discourse.

2020-07-29 18:36:48,"Latin America has rarely been able to function having ""representative governments"", much less true democracies. 

Even the few that have been able to sustain such forms of government have also had dictators at some points in the past such as Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay.

Latin America has never been governed well, but the few governments that have actually keep law and order and peace and created prosperity have mostly been from either civilian or military dictatorships going back to the early 19th Century when most of Latin America rebelled against colonial rule and became ""independent nations"".

The new ""republics"" were controlled and ruled by the White Supremacist ""Creoles"" who were Europeans born in the ""New World"". These people still rule every nation in Latin America, except for Cuba, either directly or indirectly. Such rule by oligarchs and their puppets is unlikely to change any time soon---or ever. It is just the way things are."
2020-07-30 00:20:29,"Great article, good point.

Having said that, I am waiting for The Times to point out that democracy in the USA is very much in danger. We obviously have a president with totalitarian tendencies who has spent his first term attacking our institutions.

If re-elected, this democracy is finished. Where is the media to sound the alarm? France held back the threat of the Le Pens in no small part due to the great work of the media. 

In this country, the media deserves some blame for not stopping Trump’s first term, and it will deserve even more blame for allowing his re-election, and the end of American Democracy."

Hold on, I grew up in Haiti. The latest government has been elected democratically. In fact, it has been elected twice because the first time his opponents were not happy with the results. I don't think it is fair to lump Haiti in this group. I agree that the Haitian's government is not doing well - that's nothing new - but it was elected democratically and everyone thought these 2 elections were fair. It's just the guy is bad at governing"
2020-07-30 02:35:31,"Rightwing dictators imposed by the USA to Latin American countries via intimidation, corruption and assassinations, have never been democracies.  

Left wing governments now in power are the legitimate reaction to the oppression and exploitation that the USA has overtly and covertly supported. 

Trump is now giving us a sobering experience, with his lies, misinformation, corruption and endless stream of deaths and chaos, of what it is like for well-intentioned leaders to protect the interests of their countries.

We are in no position to be critical."
2020-07-29 13:14:44,"I'm conflicted when I think of this issue. I was in Target yesterday and there were two middle aged women, both white and dressed really nicely, blatantly shopping without a mask, which is the law in this state. Not surprisingly we have been inundated by people from other states. I don't know they were from somewhere else because I didn't stop and talk to them. I almost went and found an employee but then I thought what if there's some kind of altercation. If someone got hurt I would feel terrible. If I see large scale noncompliance, I will report it to the management of the business, which I have done. But I am practicing critical distancing from those people. Meaning, I turned, reversed course, and went about my errands using a different route. ￼￼￼"
2020-07-29 13:15:29,"Yesterday I was in a local hardware store. Five men were already in line as I entered. None was wearing a mask.

Compliance is higher in the bigger chains -- supermarkets,  pharmacies, big-box retail. I note that these stores have a higher percentage of women... what's the ratio nationally?

But clearly without enforcement stores are simply no better than bars and restaurants."
2020-07-29 13:15:55,"This is being handled incredibly ineptly.

The solution is simple:

1. Sign and greeter at the door saying ""corporate management is not permitting us to sell anything to you if you do not wear a mask the entire time you are in the store."" No confrontation. If they question you just say: ""I'm just telling you what they told me: we will be fired if we sell to someone that hasn't worn a mask.""

2. Floor manager flags anyone not wearing mask and just tells them ""my manager has asked me to inform you we won't be allowed to sell anything to you. I'm so sorry, please come again any time when this is over or you have a mask.""

3. Manager at checkout does not permit the checkout from scanning any items by these individuals. Again, NO confrontation: ""I will be fired if I bend the rules for you, and I can't afford to lose my job.""

What are they going to do, steal the stuff? Call the cops if so. If they threaten violence, -do whatever they ask- and call the cops AFTER.

This is not complicated, just keep things calm and professional, and if they want to get violent -let them have what they want, then have them arrested outside-."
2020-07-29 13:16:07,If state and local governments were serious about mask use they would shut down stores that were not in compliance.  Otherwise there is little incentive for companies and managers to deal with this messy situation.  I don't blame them for not wanting to confront people - there are a lot of loonies out there.
2020-07-29 13:18:30,"How can any low wage worker be expected to confront anyone in an environment where people can just bring firearms? I’m 6 feet tall and weigh 200 lbs, but I would not confront someone half my size if they were carrying a gun. States that have approved open carry have opened a sick, twisted Pandora’s box of endless posturing, implied violence, and actual violence."
2020-07-29 13:19:01,All that’s needed is for cashier lines and self check outs to refuse to service customers without masks. No confrontation just big signs where you enter the store and at the start of check out lines stating no mask no service. I grow weary of public self centered behavior - it’s not a right.
2020-07-29 13:20:54,The stores know exactly what they’re doing. They get the positive overt PR bump by announcing they require masks. Then they refuse to enforce and let word of mouth and social media operate to advertise that fact. They work both sides of the street and the median too.
2020-07-29 13:21:48,"Stores like Walmart are using this as an excuse to keep taking the money of customers without masks. Protecting their employees should be their priority -- their employees would be more protected if the company actually enforced the mask rules to keep them safe (ie by hiring security guards trained to enforce the wearing of masks). This is how their employees would be safest and best served. Walmart makes these excuses to fool you into thinking they have their employees best interests at heart. But if they did, they would enforce the mask rules by hiring qualified security guards to do so and leaving their employees free to do their actual jobs (which is not confronting customers). Wlmart is simply interested in still making money from everyone who wants to shop there. They are having a laugh. They do not care about the health of their employees. This is obvious."
2020-07-29 13:22:16,I went to the grocery store yesterday (wearing a mask) and a young woman was in the front of the store with a box of disposable masks. We exchanged greetings and she was visibly nervous. I'm sure she did not think this would be part of her job when she signed up.
2020-07-29 13:23:42,"A twist on this phenomenon is store workers who don’t wear masks, or only partially.  I was in a Key Food in Park Slope yesterday afternoon. A worker unpacking boxes had his mask around his neck.  Two other employees, including the cashier who checked me out, had pulled down the mask to uncover their nose.  A couple of shoppers also had exposed noses, with no reaction from store management that I saw.
It made me uncomfortable to be in there.  What’s the use of insisting people wear a mask to walk in the door when they just take them off once they are inside?"
2020-07-29 13:24:23,First we want school teachers to become soldiers who protect students against people who could be carrying guns.  Now we want cashiers and waitresses to become soldiers who can protect us against people who won't wear masks and could be carrying guns.  I don't blame those workers for saying no.  It is not their job.  Stores need to have at least one armed security guard who can deal with unruly customers.
2020-07-29 13:24:47,If you store has a mask policy and a customer refuses to wear one just step away.  You have no obligation to serve them  If you get fired for it then sue them because you are following their policy.  Simple
2020-07-29 13:25:35,"Enforcement is the piece that is often neglected when people say they support mandates for some practice they want other people to adopt. For a government mandate, the consequences of enforcement aren't getting talked about up front. How would you enforce it? You either don't enforce it as some states have been doing or you end up making enforcing common human decency a police duty and add more petty crime to the books for selective policing. What would be the consequences? You want to throw people in jail where they are more likely to infect each other? You want to levy a fine on people who can probably not afford it or pay it anyway? And if they don't pay, will you throw them in jail?

For private mandates, the victims overwhelmingly end up being the workers who are thrust into confrontations with deeply unreasonable people.

I personally have reservations about mandates even though I wholeheartedly support wearing masks. I just feel that they are in the area of common human decency which may not be so common anymore but is still better addressed with advocacy, education, social reinforcement and not authoritarianism.

That said, people using a personal freedom argument to not wear a mask on another person's private property are delusional."
2020-07-29 13:27:06,So the masking requirement is just a business PR stunt
2020-07-29 13:27:50,"This is exactly why unions are needed. When companies are endangering the lives of their employees,  and are not willing to hire security guards to escort out customers not wearing masks, the employees should, if possible, go on strike. And customers should boycott these profits-before-people businesses. I plan to. Ironically, I strongly suspect if I were to wear a mask but no shirt or shoes I would be immediately tossed out of the store. And in neighborhoods where shop lifting is a problem, then security guards will be in the store. For the purpose of protecting the merchandise first, not the ""team members"" or ""associates""."
2020-07-29 13:28:38,"I am a male who is five feet eight inches tall and weigh 166 pounds.  

By any standards, I am not very big, even though I am in pretty good shape.  For me, confronting customers who will not wear a mask would be a difficult decision.  

I have a suggestion.  At the moment, many bars are closed and their bouncers are out of work.  Retailers, such as Walmart, where entrance is limited to one door, ought to hire laid off bouncers to enforce the mask policy."
2020-07-29 13:29:31,Could retail stores hire out-of-work bouncers? Many of them are used to nightclubs and removing/dealing with people who are unruly and think rules don’t apply to them. A grant program to allow retail stores to hire bouncers to enforce mask rules could be a win-win.
2020-07-29 13:31:42,"Thank you, Ms. Washington.  If an ACME customer refuses to wear a mask, s/he should be escorted from the store by a manager or a security guard who has been trained to de-escalate, not left free to infect other customers because people are too intimidated to confront the person."
2020-07-29 13:31:44,"Stores aren't reluctant to confront customers who are suspected of shoplifting. They have mangers and security personnel who do this. It should be the same for those who refuse to wear face masks.

At the very least, store employees should be saying, ""No mask, no service."" And they need to follow-through on that warning."
2020-07-29 13:31:57,They need to have armed security personnel to do this job. It involves threatening people's lives.
2020-07-29 13:32:17,"Stores are private property, are they not?  So they should be able to have bouncers at the entrance counting how many people in and out of the store and enforcing masks."
2020-07-29 13:34:08,"Imagine if the Trump administration sent border patrol agents with machine guns to stake out Wal-Marts and enforce wearing masks, rather than sending them after innocent protesters.

2020-07-29 13:12:06,"Let’s say that some customers decided to shop naked, or shouting at the top of their voices just for the heck of it. I think the stores would quickly find a way to remove the offending customers. 

If you surrender to irresponsible, bratty behavior, it usually gets worse. Ask any parent."
2020-07-29 13:17:02,"Last time I looked the family that owns Walmart is worth some 200  billion dollars! Yet they put their workers enforcing mask rules (which many uninformed people do not abide by) on the pandemic front lines without backup?

Is their a phrase stronger than “shame on you”?"

2020-07-29 13:25:41,"It’s really not rocket science.  You clearly post that masks are required.  If a customer ignores this you nicely remind them.  If they tell you where to go, call the police and trespass them.  They do not have a right to be in the store, it’s private property.  You enforce wearing pants, not smoking, all sorts of other things—why is this one so complicated??"
2020-07-29 13:28:49,"This is a shameful portrayal of our corporate society and why, without substantial cultural change, we are doomed. The same large corporations that take in billions pay an employee with no empowerment a token fee to trick us into thinking they care. Laws or mandates without enforcement are often useless. Are we being asked to please not bring weapons on a flight? No, they actually make sure we don’t. Here’s an idea, how about asking police or guards to fulfill an important social responsibility? How about someone offering masks to those not wearing them? We used to have smoking sections, how about no mask sections? It would be one aisle with only self check out available. 
The banks that hold corporate money are much better protected than the health of their employees and customers."
2020-07-29 13:35:02,"There is a relatively simple solution for large stores, especially for the large stores which are part of a chain store organization.

1) Do like Costco and have an employee (regular or security) at the entrance who denies entrance to anyone not masked and not wearing the mask properly over BOTH nose and mouth.

2) Any customer who objects at the entrance is simply told not to enter.  If the customer enters, then that customer instantly becomes a trespasser.  The employee simply uses their portable radio or cell phone to inform the store manager who immediately calls police to remove the person for criminal trespass.  After that, it is the responsibility of the government's police and prosecutors.

3) Any customer who removes or lowers their mask after gaining lawful entrance previously could similarly simply be reminded by the manager or a security employee.  If the customer does not immediately put his mask on properly, then order them to leave.  If they don't, then the customer immediately becomes a trespasser and the manager or security person calls police as above.  After that, it is the responsibility of the government's police and prosecutors.

If the local government chooses not to enforce the trespassing laws, then it is only the fault of the politicians, police, and prosecutors if the public's health and lives are jeopardized by fellow customers who won't properly wear masks."
2020-07-29 13:36:01,"Employees of a store are spending at least half of the time they are exposed to Covid-19 virus while working. So the hospitalisation costs of
any worker - and any payouts for injury,  death and  loss of income to a family - should be at least half paid by their employer."
2020-07-29 13:36:25,"Bars and clubs are closed.  Large retail stores like Walmart and others can hire bouncers to ensure masks are worn prior to entering.  No mask, no shopping."
2020-07-29 13:37:28,"At CVS in Manhattan, I asked the clerk to ask two customers to put on masks. The clerk refused, saying it was ""corporate policy"" that employees not intervene. She said it would be ""unfair and illegal"" to deny access to the pharmacy counter to somebody who does not wish to wear a mask (even though the two customers were in the grocery section, not in the pharmacy section).

I asked her whether it was ""fair"" to deny pharmacy access to an immune-compromised customer who cannot be in the same aisle as someone who is not wearing a mask. I also asked her if it was ""corporate policy' not to intervene if a customer came into the store with a lit cigarette. She could not answer either question.

I reported this incident to CVS Customer Service but got no response."
2020-07-29 13:37:47,they don't let anybody in without shoes or shirts. and this is way more important
2020-07-29 13:38:38,"WaPo ran a story about a general store worker in one of the Carolinas who resorted to locking the door to the store. Customers used the doorbell and were admitted only if masked. 

Many Walmart and Target stores have curbside pickup. Why can’t unmasked shoppers be locked out, no exceptions? They can still do curbside pickup. If I tried to go in without shoes or a shirt or pants or if I was smoking, it would be a no-brainer. This is not hard. That anyone thinks it is, boggles the mind."
2020-07-29 13:40:22,It seems that enforcement has to be by the customers.  In states that permit open weapon carry this may save store employees but cost the store a customer or two.  The simple answer would be for the larger stores to request police assistance.
2020-07-29 13:41:51,"We, as fellow shoppers at these stores have a role we can play as well.  Of course, there will be one or two in a big store, but if there are many unmasked shoppers, just leave.  Do not give your money to places that do not value the safety of their workers or customers."
2020-07-29 13:42:39,"Managers, not employees, must be the first responders for confronting non compliance in stores. It’s beyond belief that people actually can walk into a store with loaded weapons. And they truly believe it’s their Freedom. If Walmart can’t do it, have every store watched by State Police. It’s worth it- who wants to confront anger and savagery every time they shop??!!"
2020-07-29 13:44:53,"Customers who are in stores where the mask policy is not enforced should walk out.  Do not patronize stores that are not willing to protect you.  

The ones without a mask should not be served or permitted to buy anything."
2020-07-29 13:45:11,Security personnel or store managers should be the ones enforcing masks. And it would help if governors would uniformly make mask wearing mandatory.

2020-07-29 13:50:26,"Stores need to employ additional people to enforce/convince/prevent entry, so that noone gets into the shop without wearing a mask. Any reasonably sized shop here in Toronto does that, and customers prefer those shops. Simple, albeit part of the transition in which we are all engaged now. Simply not right to place yet another burdern (enforcement) on people who are essential workers, low paid, and already coping with so many challenges, while being paid peanuts!"
2020-07-29 13:52:02,"A mask doesn't count unless it is worn properly. They MUST cover your nose. Also, ventilated M95 masks protect the wearer but infect everyone else, as they do not filter the outgoing breath. You can recognize them by the round plastic valve in the center; it lets air out but not in.

Most masks have a flexible wire that can be bent to shape them to your nose. A single bend at the ridge of your nose and a counter-bend at the left and right sides works best to close the gap between your nose and cheeks."
2020-07-29 13:53:16,"Maybe a $100 ""surcharge"" for not wearing a mask will get people's attention. Put a sign on the door stating the policy. Workers can split the money earned at the end of the day."
2020-07-29 13:53:30,"I don’t understand why retailers can post signs saying, “No shirt, no shoes, no service”, but refusing service to someone without a mask is “going too far”.

In the spring, we had several employees die of COVID at a single Walmart store here in Denver.  Can’t we all agree that the health of employees are more important than the delicate feelings of a few militant conspiracy theorists?"
2020-07-29 13:55:13,"Mandatory mask laws should be aimed at places of business, not at individuals.  Fine retailers for maskless customers as if they were selling restricted goods to minors, say $1,000 for each offense.  A few stings and you'll see off-duty uniformed police at every entry enforcing mask and gun policies, not unarmed security guards.  Economic ""incentives"" work."

The US couldn't get its rate below 20 000 cases a day and still opened for business. You won't wear masks. The cases went up and was ignored because the mortality rate was still low. Now more than a thousand die every day. Surprised?
Coming up is the next two accelerators of school reopening and winter cold weather.

You will have the worst outcome of any developed nation. Possibly even the whole world. Overseas reaction ranges from pity to schadenfreude.

It's unwise for staff to argue with mask-less individuals around the store, or even at the entrance. It can be dangerous; it's not similar to a flight attendant enforcing rules to people who have already been thoroughly screened for weapons, and who know if they become violent on an airplane will without question be arrested and face serious criminal charges.

A reasonable and proactive solution is to outright refuse service to anyone who enters the business and shops without a mask. Simply decline to process items at checkout. There is no need to escalate; if a customer becomes threatening they can be told to leave with or without the merchandise. Effectively the patron would be conducting robbery or shoplifting, which are real crimes to which police would respond. If word gets out that service is firmly declined at the cash register people will comply or stay away."
2020-07-29 13:57:52,"I feel for employees in retail who are having to confront hostile customers.  I work at small rural hospital and each day our screeners at the front door have challenging interactions with people refusing to wear masks. At a HOSPITAL, when they are SICK or are visiting SICK people. These often are the same people who want us to provide a magic solution for all their medical complaints. We are scrambling to keep staff and patients safe and we have to to divert our efforts to deal with this unnecessary complication."
2020-07-29 13:59:44,Hourly workers do not get paid enough to handle these kind of confrontations. I’d like to see the CEO of Walmart spend a day working in the same store along side Mr. Vanderpool asking gun toting customers to comply with mask rules.
2020-07-29 14:05:01,"Security should be enforcing it and not the average worker.

Signs should be all over and if the offender tries to buy anything should be refused.

Repeat offenders should be barred from going into the store on the outside by security."
2020-07-29 14:05:19,Years ago I drove for the CTA in Chicago. A bus driver's job was to tell the customer what the fare was. And it ended right there. Too many drivers were injured or killed because they also tried to enforce the rule.
2020-07-29 14:06:38,"I have been reading some of the comments and many suggest having security or management call police everytime a person becomes irate & violates the mask policy. Then you might as well build a detention center in the parking lot and have several police officers on standby because that is what your up against. 
But that would be too authoritarian and controversial in the current political landscape. 
Maybe these large retail stores can just have people order online and have the option to schedule/pick up outside the store. But wait, then a whole new dilemma is created with customers who believe they don't have to wait on a line and fights break out among customers and back to square one.  
This is the reason I opt to order online/delivery when possible.
Going to a public gathering retail location is of last resort."
2020-07-29 14:09:01,"This is true. I work retail at one of the stores mentioned in the article.  All staff must wear masks but we cannot tell a customer to wear one if they come in without one. This is to protect employees from being attacked both verbally and physically by some crazy customers. Our lives according to corp are important and they don't want anyone to be injured as has happened in several stores. It's ok for a mask less shoplifter to come in the store and clean us out and we can't stop them bc whatever they are stealing our lives are more important. I get that. But god forbid an employee pulls their mask down to take a drink or their nose is uncovered for a few seconds we can be fired. It is also the stores policy to keep the temperature in all stores at 78. Imagine wearing a mask when the humidity and temp rise into the 80's as our office was/is most days. 
A mask announcement does go over the pa but it's only background Muzak so people don't really hear it.  A manager can read the policy on the pa. Only managers can approach a customer and gently ask them to get their mask from their car or buy a box but we cannot ask them to leave.  By the grace of god no one in my store had gotten sick. I've seen  many posts from employees from the fb and Reddit...the morale in the company is extremely low bc of the terrible response to c19 and the cutting of hours to have the barest of staff coverage. We are the best support of each other in the store. This is my truth today"
2020-07-29 14:10:54,"Get used to it.  With police departments disbanded civilian’s enforcing mask patrols will feel like preferred duty.  Think of the exciting split seconds decisions though:  “You, without the face mask and the gun, either put it on or drop it!”  What do I do first!"
2020-07-29 14:12:27,"Why not just a couple of security officials at the door of each store, and a slightly more observed entry than the free-walking one.  No mask, no entry.  Like a bouncer at a bar.   

The stores/companies are the ones allowing people to enter.  People will catch on quickly when their behavior isn't tolerated.  And states need to make mask mandates actual law if they aren't, that is a punishable offense in blatant cases like going into a public place, but not just walking down the street.   Most people will wear a mask or opt to leave.  If people throw violent fits, call the police like you would any other time.  

Don't support and tolerate the idea that ""everyone has a different viewpoint"" on this.  It's August with 150k+ dead, this should have been figured out in April."
2020-07-29 14:13:58,It should not be the employees that enforce this policy.  We should have fines for not wearing a mask indoors and the police should come and write tickets.
2020-07-29 14:14:15,"I have witnessed confrontations between retail workers asking customers to wear masks and be told ""expletives"" of abuse. This is, of course, revealing the American sense of ""Selfishness & Ignorance"" and exacerbated by and in combination with the lack of leadership on the part of Trump and mostly Republican governors."
2020-07-29 14:15:40,"The story highlights the real issue with these mandates, they are really unenforceable. Here in MN, the state government is trying to get as much compliance as possible without enforcement, which is pretty much a waste of time. People are not complying and without enforcement, they do not have to. The are egged on by Trumpians, who happen to be a cancer on one party right now, who are spreading large amounts of disinformation that endanger others. These seem to be the ""law and order"" types, until it comes to their behavior or something that inconveniences them as their selfish and self-centered ways are enabled by their news sources (Fox, InfoWars and others) and a major lack of enforcement. I wish I knew what to do, but many of the mandates are simply being flouted without consequence because ""it isn't real"" or ""you'll just get a cold"". As someone who actually is wearing a mask as mandated and requested by the state of MN, this is maddening. I feel for the employee who has to enforce it, but if that is what you are paid to do, then do it. Enforcement has to happen at some point and people do not have to like it, it will help them survive."
2020-07-29 14:15:42,"Social distancing and mask violations are rampant in New York and New Jersey.   I ate at a restaurant yesterday on the Upper East Side where some tables were appropriately distanced and other were not.  Some employees wore their masks properly  and other did not.
Many people wear masks but do not wear them properly, i.e, they pull it down below their nose.  This defeats the purpose of wearing a mask.   Perhaps these ambassadors should not only encourage mask use but instruct people on proper mask use.  
Furthermore, every company including Walmart, Walgreens, Acme, and Lowes to name a few must instruct their employees on proper mask use.  The number of employees that do not wear a mask properly is unbelievable.  Every large company should have customized masks made for their employees and it should become part of their uniform.   
Public health officials and law enforcement must be empowered to enforce mask use and social distancing.  But, law enforcement must also set an example and wear a mask when in public.  Their complaint that they are hot and affect their breathing when chasing a perpetrator is valid, but only if they are chasing a perpetrator should they be allowed to remove them."
2020-07-29 14:16:52,"Most people would not question the need to put on clothing to go out in public, but many people freak out about having to wear a mask  during a global health pandemic for 15 minutes.

For many years retail stores had signs on their doors that said ""No shirt, no shoes, no service"" and no one questioned it. Today, people only care about themselves, not others. And rudeness seems to be the norm."
2020-07-29 14:18:33,Retailers just need to print masks with funny images like a giant smile and pass them out at the door. Here have a smile on us! Maybe the opposite image for New Yorkers. If you make each store with a different image the masks might become collectibles.

2020-07-29 14:20:35,"Maybe the store can just refuse to check out customers without masks. The customer would then have to leave the line, or perhaps walk out without paying. Have cameras and police ready to arrest any shoplifters."
2020-07-29 14:20:36,"One potential solution is financial:  A large sign saying "" All item pricing includes a $100 covid surcharge per item.  But we have a $100 per item discount if you wear a mask the entire time you are in the store.""

Vendors have the right to set their prices and have sales.  This is one way to use that power.    (Leaving a store with an item without paying the marked price is shoplifting)"
2020-07-29 14:20:50,"There’s probably a correlation between those who demand the economy reopen, tell people to go back to work instead of taking unemployment and won’t wear masks/harass workers who tell them to.

2020-07-29 13:49:54,"This is an unnecessary battle created out of whole cloth by Donald Trump and his GOP bobblehead cronies who set up a faux controversy solely for political gain.  Playing culture war games as a distraction from their failure to take effective action, the nonsense about not wearing a mask actually made and is making matters worse.  The GOP and Trump never take full account of the impacts of their political rhetoric or guage just to what degree there are a lot of stupid people out there who will follow their ""advice"".  To their, their families and their neighbors detriment.  

This current state of crisis is entirely at the feet of Trump and the GOP and the utter failure of effective and intelligent leadership."

2020-07-29 14:21:41,"A simple and non-confrontational solution is for stores not to ring up anyone who enters and shops without a mask, with this policy announced at the door. No mask = no sale. They can't force people to wear a mask, but no one is forcing the store to take their cash/credit for goods. 

Putting workers in the line of fire is the height of selfish behavior, on the part of mask-less customers and on the part of management who dumps enforcement on the folks making 10$ an hour."
2020-07-29 13:54:26,"A woman was wearing a mask at the grocery store I use, but her nose wasn't covered.

She stood in front of the bin of bunches of dill, picked them up one by one and sniffed them, touching them to her nose. I alerted one worker, who shrugged and did nothing,. I alerted his boss, who confronted the woman but only asked her to stop touching the produce to her nose."
2020-07-29 14:15:58,"...and governors, like Holcomb in Indiana, are doing the same thing. Announcing a mask mandate and then saying they won't enforce it. Sheriffs, law-enforcement officers as their core mission, refusing to enforce the law, instead telling us the laws they will enforce and then laws they won't. This is, in fact, what ANARCHY really is. A total breakdown of law enforcement, a Darwinist approach to the rule of law. If I don't like a law, I just ignore it, using intimidation as a cudgel, right? Let's bring the 2nd Amendment people into this, too. I'll just bring a gun with me the next time I don't want to do something.

Survival of the stubbornnest, most petulant, most threatening. The rest of us can just order off of Amazon and do store pickup and abandon the idea of going into stores ever again because the vipers have taken over."
2020-07-29 14:17:49,"I work in an industry where I visit construction job sites. At the places, about one in five people wears a mask. It's gotten to the point that I do what I can to not go near these people. At one such place, people were laughingly coughing and sneezing on one another, joking about masks. I wish I was joking.
I realize liberals are polite, too polite to approach the realization that the people avoiding reality and acting selfishly are right-wing. I'm tired of seeing liberals demonized by the right while walking on eggshells not to offend people who live in a ridiculous and self-serving false reality."
2020-07-29 14:07:51,"In Michigan. stores masks are legally mandated - that means stores are not supposed to admit or serve the unmasked.  This is similar to the legal requirement for bars not to serve customers who are obviously too intoxicated already.  But - surprise! - often these drunkards refuse to be cut off and insist on being served.  That's where the bouncer comes in, and that's what these big chain stores need too.  Bouncers. Heck they will probably pay for themselves due to their shoplifting deterrence effect alone."
2020-07-29 14:26:10,"Here in Melbourne, masks became mandatory last week and it was mostly greeted with a sense of relief. We actually feel safer to go out now. 
A few wannabe conspiracy theorists tried to gate crash some stores without wearing one, but were all dealt with properly by the staff or the police.
The elephant in the room is of course we don't have people carrying guns around. 
I feel sorry for the staff interviewed here - they are put in such a difficult position by spineless, greedy corporations which just want it both ways. 
How about trying something different? If you spot someone without a mask (and a gun), take off yours and fake coughing uncontrollably. See how they react when the shoe is on the other foot. At the very least, they may run away from you so you will then be safe ..."

I am disgusted when I see shoppers without masks, but furious when I see EMPLOYEES with masks below the nose or chin.  This has been at stores that had posted requirements for masks before it was a mandate.  That said, I wish the requirements were not just mandates, but laws.  I wish security guards would take the burden off employees to enforce, and I wish police — who I know are busy — would on occasion, do quick walk throughs and enforce (if masks were a law with a fine attached).

When read that way, Managers should have the strength to ask non-mask wearers to leave. If not, Police are called, and they enforce it. The cashier or storefront greeter should not have to deal with those escalated situations. When they have to, it is a failure of store leadership."

Laws indicate you can order a customer to leave (or not serve them) if they aren't wearing shoes or pants or a shirt.  If they refuse, you can call the police.

What their intentions are, is obvious:  They want the mask wearing people to get used to not having everyone wearing masks, so they won't refuse to patronize the store.

In short they are attempting to desensitize those customers who are truly concerned about the spread of the virus.

These stores do not care about the well being of their customers, nor their employees.  If they were concerned, they would hire off duty law enforcement, who could stand at the store entrance, armed if necessary, and have them insist people obey the stated store rules."

2020-07-29 14:52:50,"Even as the president is trying to get the economy running again, and everyone would love to return to work or support businesses, it is extremely unfair to expect regular store employees to enforce mask-wearing.  And yet masks are the minimum for shoppers to protect themselves, employees and other shoppers.

Larger stores already have security, so these should remove anyone who refuses to wear masks.  It would be more difficult 
for small businesses to hire additional personnel; alas it would be up to the owner or employees to decide whether or not to enforce.

Unfortunately, on a NY radio yesterday, an otherwise rational host argued against enforcing rules, believing it would be useless, and said it should be ‘voluntary’. Difficult to do in general, for sure, but necessary for individual businesses. We’ve seen how too many interpret ‘voluntary’ to mean ‘optional’, to mean ‘unnecessary’.

Fortunately here in MA most people are willing to wear masks, and, in some cases, have hand sanitizers sprayed on their hands before going in, obviating the need for security.  It’s a self-sustaining cycle, as people see it’s helped keep
infection rates low (after being an initial hotspot), and remain motivated to keep at it."
2020-07-29 14:52:55,"Businesses, especially major ones, have no excuse not to hire the necessary personnel to manage the problem. In some parts of the country these may need to be armed security guards. 

However, those that refuse to wear masks are only part of the problem, there needs to be better policing of appropriate mask wearing. Having a piece of cloth somewhere in the vicinity of your head is not acceptable. 

And could someone please provide the religious reason why someone can’t wear a mask? Many religions require mask like adornment but I have never heard of one that has tenets that prevent covering any specific part of your body."
2020-07-29 14:53:58,"Where I live mask-wearing is inconsistent at best.  For this reason we buy everything online or order online and do curbside pickup.  The last time I went to our grocery store, there were several maskless people shopping.  A manager was wearing a mask down on his neck while talking with a masked customer who needed help with something on a shelf, their faces about a foot apart.  A group of four maskless 18-20-year-olds deliberately went through isles and moved in close to people as a ""joke"".  One customer had his mask on his chin while having an involved conversation on his mobile - I told the service desk about it, and they stared at me.  What are they supposed to do?  You take your life in your hands trying to tell anyone around here anything, because you never know who has a gun, who will harass you, who will bring you to court, who will deride you.  They think they're ""clean"", that the virus won't happen to them.  We wear our masks and stay out of the stores as much as possible.  It's not worth the physical danger or the anxiety."
2020-07-29 14:54:15,"The simple and sure way to get people to wear masks is to levy  a fine against anyone who tries to enter a store without a mask.  I have read that this is effective in at least one city.  If the police would stand outside the store and issue tickets, even arrest repeat offenders, the problem would be resolved. Enforement would be a short lived burden on the police.  After all,  how many people refuse to stop for a red light because there is no traffic in their way?"

Every time you challenge a person for not wearing a mask you are increasing the spread of the virus and possibly infecting yourself, assuming the person is infected. It really is better to not say anything. Don’t make waves, don’t spread the virus. Challenging a person and risking a scene will spread the virus more than if you just left them alone. Fairness doesn’t matter. It’s a virus spread in the air. It doesn’t recognize rules or values or morals."
2020-07-29 14:58:25,"I feel for these folks that are often in a poorly-paying position and yet are often burdened with having to enforce mandates whether they be legally-stipulated or just store policy.

2020-07-29 14:58:49,"The solution is very simple, a solution that we have adpted in little old Latvia (which at 1/150th the population of the U.S. has 1/5,000th of US cases).  Pass a law, violate it, you get a ticket with a nice fine.  Recently a restaurant was fined 5,000 euros for violating social distancing rules and the patrons were fined 2,000 euros.  I suspect that neither will commit that infraction again.  Now, admittedly we do not have the reactionary-right that the U.S. has been blessed with.  For that problem I offer no solution."
2020-07-29 14:59:08,"Maybe a large sign ‘no mask, no service’ on the front door and at cashier station would help a bit.  Give free masks to people that don’t have one and would like to shop.  Store employees are really the ones at risk of infection and they should organize and even sue companies that fail to protect them."
2020-07-29 14:59:14,"Many mom and pop stores have buzzers and locks on their doors to prevent people coming in without masks. Perhaps big box stores and grocery stores could could install a similar system?

They could create dedicated entrances and exits (pretty much like they have at Target), locked and monitored by employees who buzz in only customers wearing masks, or can alert the store manager if a customer can’t wear a mask for medical reasons and would like to be accommodated curbside."
2020-07-29 15:08:39,"“My feeling is, if you cannot say something as simple as, ‘You have to wear a mask in the store,’ you shouldn’t be working in a store,” she said. “I refuse to believe that every person who gets angry about having to wear a mask is capable of committing murder.””

Toni Vitanza is not alone in dismissing the level of aggression and threat presented by armed and aggressive conservatives. She would never have encountered them within the confines of an airplane where guns are not allowed. Yes not everyone getting angry constituents a physical threat but a seriously percentage does. That is the point to openly carrying guns, it’s about aggression, intimidation and threat. The danger they can present is very real.

Besides it’s simply not the job of retail staff to deal with increasingly hostile behavior exasperated by a highly contentious political and societal time. 

Nor should we think that what currently constitutes store “security” is the answer either. When you say these things please think about what you are saying. Store security is by and large someone with little or no enforcement or deescalation training or the physical ability to react to aggression wearing a uniform. They are no more trained and prepared to deal with these people than the retail employees and their managers. 

Not wearing a mask in a retail establishment needs to be a civil infraction with a significant fine enforced by a “properly trained” law enforcement officer. Vetted and trained, not defunded."
2020-07-29 15:08:40,"If this is happening at retail stores in August, imagine the potential for bedlam and even violence at voting stations in November if some voters refuse to wear masks, others object and there is no mandate in place to require wearing one nor a way to enforce it. These scenarios are recipes for what could be a disastrous election day."
2020-07-29 15:09:22,This seems like an excellent opportunity for stores to employ all the bouncers and security guards that can’t work at closed bars and nightclubs. Those guys know how to deal with entitled and unruly customers.
2020-07-29 15:09:49,"I can personally say that many stores talk a good game but don't actually enforce their rules. One supermarket chain in my area claims to require people to wear masks, to have one-way aisles, mandate social distancing. It's all just a big PR show. I was there last week. Everyone was ignoring the one-way aisles, walking just a few feet past each other. And then two young men walked into the supermarket not wearing any masks. None of the employees in the store said anything to them. I politely told the two men to please put on a mask. They told me they didn't have to because they were staying 6 feet away from people. Complete, blatant disregard for the rules - and no one enforced them. No one told them to put on a mask."

Ugh, it is not a REASONABLE accommodation to say, ""Oh, okay, well, no mask or other face covering required then."" That is just flat out unreasonable in the face of this public health nightmare. 

A reasonable accommodation is not necessarily the accommodation the person wants , but the one that will let them access the services while protecting public health. So Walmart can provide a reasonable accommodation by not allowing shoppers without face coverings to enter and talking to them about what they need. Can the customer wait in the car or a waiting area while a Walmart employee conducts the shopping? Can the transaction then be concluded at the car or waiting area? 

If there is no REASONABLE accommodation that will work to protect its employees and other shoppers then Walmart doesn't have to accommodate!"
2020-07-29 15:19:06,"My solution: Only patronize establishments where mask wearing is the norm.  Same thing for properly organized curbside pick-up, etc. Walk away if things don't look good. And share your experience--good or bad--with the stare manager, corporate head quarters, and your neighbors. 

Fortunately, around here, there are enough businesses where staff and customers take things seriously enough so that I can get everything I really need from them.  Neighbor recommendations have been very useful in deciding where to shop. This has pushed me to try new sources for various items...and, in some cases, the new source is actually better than my old source and is assured of my future custom even if/when my previous source cleans up their act."

2020-07-29 15:20:02,There are far too many Americans looking to cause a scene or fight over their “right” not to wear a mask.  There is no penalty for this behavior so it will continue.

Small stores need the help, and Walmart and Target and other large retailers are just playing it both ways - we enforce mask rule/we don't enforce mask rule by not hiring off-duty police to deal with those who do not want to wear masks."
2020-07-29 15:26:26,"While I have admiration for companies and store that have mask policies, the problem is that without government mandates and support these policies place the employees literally on the 'front-line'. A front-line where they do risk life and limb. Liability for infecting customers may be part, if not all, of the reason for these policies. Thus, removing liability will make the US even worse with respect to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, both to employees and to customers. This speaks to why the US needs a national policy with respect to masks and distancing, along with enforcement by local governmental agencies."

2020-07-29 15:36:47,"The easiest way to resolve most hard-to-enforce problems is through incentives.

Confronting someone who is so cavalier about the virus that they will not wear a mask is a bad idea. They may talk to you up close and shower you with virus.

So, stores could offer people a chance to leave a list and credit card at the door and use a credit card. But once someone blows through that stop sign and roams around the store with no mask, the store could refuse to let them pay, leaving them to shoplift and have the police called, or leave with nothing and have wasted their time. 

This avoids a face to face confrontation, and removes the incentive to enter the store."
2020-07-29 15:36:52,"It will only work if we all take it seriously.  Many stores around here (northwestern CT and Mass) have an employee (or 2) stationed at the door who invites each customer in only if they are wearing a mask.   Some places have disposable masks available for customers without masks.  Once a person is in the store, maskless, it's hard to remove them if they refuse. However, the store doesn't have to serve them, check them out, or allow them to leave with any items they haven't been able to pay for. Clerks and checkers can just walk away."
2020-07-29 15:38:49,"OMG! I have just solved the whole problem. If someone refuses to wear a mask -- either before entering the store, or taking it off once in the store -- announce over the loudspeaker that the store is now closed, no one will be allowed to purchase anything, and everyone needs to exit immediately so disinfection can take place . 

And make a point of calling attention to the offender. Approximate height, weight, and skin color. Make & model of car. Clothing.

Of course it is not possible for one employee to enforce the company rules, but a whole Walmart full of mask-wearing customers can convince the mask-adverse that they need to get over it.  

At least when they are in Walmart."

2020-07-29 15:43:17,At our local liquor store there are signs posted that say - NO Mask No service. Simple as that- these stores need to get armed security to stop people at the doors who refuse to wear masks and have signs clearly posted. People can shop elsewhere if they refuse to comply or be told to come back when the pandemic is over. Alternatively those of us that wear masks can boycott stores that dont uphold a mask policy. This outrageous selfishness only seems to be an issue in this country. Asian countries seem to have a lot more respect for their fellow citizens- its truly a sad indictment of the american culture.
2020-07-29 15:44:08,"Many other comments here ask of mask rule enforcement “why is this so complicated?”

To my knowledge, no one has ever pulled a gun on a minimum wage employee for being asked to wear pants or shoes or not smoke. 

Carrying a gun in a Walmart right now has nothing to do with the need for protection; it’s an unsubtle means of intimidation.  No reasonable person is going to risk an armed confrontation over a mask. If stores want to put teeth in their rules they need to hire dedicated security staff. I hear there are some people out there looking for jobs....."

2020-07-29 15:55:01,"Not wearing a mask in stores that require it is trespassing - a crime (if the store doesn't allow the unmasked to enter). Given the potentially consequences of such criminal activity why do the stores enforce any rules at all? Is shoplifting also tolerated? It's less harmful than not wearing a mask in a closed space. Why do the offenders bother to pay at all? They have open-carry guns and the stores are not confronting them for not wearing masks so why would they confront them for shoplifting? If one's religion prohibits using money, wouldn't asking such a person to pay violate their First Amendment rights? Also, wouldn't the economic damage from having to close the stores be greater than damage done by shoplifting? Not trying to give the antimaskers more ideas - just pointing out the inconsistencies in policy enforcement.
Anyone who refuses to wear a mask in a store that requires it should be charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon on top of the misdemeanor trespassing, IMO."

2020-07-29 14:32:18,Trump has thoroughly politicized an effective preventive face mask that in the deadly 1918 pandemic was a non-issue. His loyal followers now associate not wearing a mask as a genuine test of loyalty to Trump. Trump warned us that his followers were so loyal to him that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and get away with it. Let’s hope November’s election proves him wrong.

Why is it left up to untrained workers making less than minimum wage to enforce the rules, especially when idiots are allowed to carry concealed weapons & could whip out their guns & shoot anyone in a dispute? Our governor refused to allow local municipalities to institute mask-wearing requirements, leaving it up to individual businesses to do so. That means police are allowed to shirk, & indeed, we have sheriffs who have declared they will not enforce mask wearing. Lax gun laws, libertarianism, & pandemics are not a good mix. Now we have the perfect setup for random shootings to occur. Add “self-defense” laws, & the message is, it’s OK to shoot someone if you think they might want to harm you. They don’t actually have to be in the process of harming you — you just have to be paranoid enough to think that they might be about to do so. That’s the essence of the argument that helped Trayvon Martin’s killer get off. Now imagine an armed & crazy anti-masker convinced that wearing a mask will kill them. With no gun control laws, plus the self-defense laws providing cover for these nutcases, it’s no wonder retailers & restaurants are having trouble finding workers who are willing to risk their lives for $11 an hour confronting paranoid fools who might just whip out their concealed weapon & shoot the worker who’s been tasked with a job that belongs to trained law enforcement."

Why? Because our lives literally depend on it. 

Security guards don't have to be menacing in demeanor. In fact, security should promote the idea of being friendly and helpful but also convey the fact that customers not wearing masks will not be let in to the store in question. 

 Store employees should definitely not be put in positions of danger or harm because of Covid-19--there's enough stress going around right now for employees who work with the public; they need to be given extra consideration and comfort.

Finally: come on America. it's not forever--we can definitely do much better by seeing the value in staying home and when we must go out, by wearing safety masks for a MONTH OR SO. Until we all comply, this virus will stay, period.

Maybe the store can request a credit card from the anti-masker prior to being allowed in the store and inform the anti-masker that all of their purchases will be subject to an upcharge to cover ""cleanup"" costs after they leave the store. Someone will have to follow the anti-masker as they shop to be sure all items are properly cleaned. Obviously, the upcharge will be enormous."

You are fighting an enemy, that in order to defeat him, you only have wear a peace of cloth infront of your mouths and noses, wash/disinfect your hands regularly and keep a safe distance to other people.

No amount of flag-waving, anthem-singing or faux-patriotism is able to cover up how divided America is and how lethargic your leadership - on all levels - is acting in the face of this crisis. I am sure China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are watching closely how this American Tragedy is unfolding, they see how disfunctional your society and leadership are, how 150.000 Americans died and nobody in the White House really cares and how you still can't get your act together six months into a crisis it took other, poorer countries three months to contain.

I can go to a manned checkout stand but I don’t have to speak to the cashier.  Early in the epidemic some of them wanted to be sociable and chat. Now they are mostly quiet and don’t talk.
At Sam’s Club I can scan all of the items I purchase as I put them in the cart with my smart phone using the Sam’s Club app.  When I am done shopping I pay through the app and it displays a scan code for the masked store employee standing at the exit. The employee scans the code and an item in the cart. I am then free to leave.  I don’t say a word to anyone in the store. Most people are the same. They keep their distance, even the few that aren’t wearing a mask. At first not many customers wore a mask but now a lot more are. Nobody is challenged.  There are not any incidents or arguments. Even those who don’t have a mask are treated with respect. People eventually get the message and wear a mask next time they go shopping.
If this sounds like an advertisement for Walmart then I guess it is. I have been impressed with how they have handled the difficult  challenges of this epidemic.  Before this I was critical but I have changed my tune. They should however give the employees a bigger bonus. The Walton family can afford it."

The CDC reports that the asymptomatic  transmission rate is pretty much unknown. So most of us err on the side of caution. But some err on the side of choice.  

There are fanatics on both sides—some cite the Constitution; some assault those without masks. 

Where I live, there are few mask protestors and they stand out like sore thumbs. They are easily avoided. And, since they are asymptomatic, the distance I keep far reduces the risk. 

Every store is different of course. But in most, the risk posed by a few mask protestors is speculative. If half the customers at your Walmart are mask protestors, they are a serious problem. If it’s less than five and you’re in panic mode, then you’ve got the problem."
2020-07-29 17:18:29,"Here's an idea.  As a patron, tell the nearest patron to inform the manager that if they won't enforce mask wearing, they refuse to shop there, and then LEAVE.  Leave even if you have a cart half full of merchandise or groceries, or whatever.

If rational customers who insist on feeling shopping in stores with mask wearing customers start STANDING UP enough for managers to care about their bottom line, I think they'll find a way to do at least some moderate level of enforcement -- or lose business.  

If, for example, Walmart X doesn't want to do enforcement, fine -- let the non mask wearers and customers who don't care go there, where other shoppers can shop in a somewhat reasonable environment in the middle of this pandemic."

This has been the mantra in small businesses of all my home towns since 1965. Why not just put ""...No Mask"" as an addendum?

Add to that ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason""  (also prevalent and prominent in small businesses for as long as I can remember) and you have a two pronged approach to stop customers at the door and send them home.

In 2018 my local electric/plumbing supply company put up a sign banning all NRA members.  No one said 'boo' about that.  No one got shot.  We simply took our business to the big box store around the corner.  That supplier with the sign went out of business last year.

My local Wegmans grocery has a mandatory mask policy.  There is NO enforcement, but most folks still wear a mask (as I do).  It is our duskier citizens who either did not read the sign, can't hear the PA system or simply refuse to follow yet another rule.  Management is terrified to bar them from the store for fear of reprisals in social media, so these folks continue to put all the shoppers at risk.  Is it any wonder that minority communities are reporting higher than normal rates of infection?

If you don't stop anti-mask folks at the door, you will likely not see your masked customers returning.  Since this is a health and social issue, certainly store managers and employees can handle enforcement without police, right?  Just step up and tell those without masks to take their business elsewhere.

Cheers!"

There is zero reason to allow them into the store."
2020-07-29 17:56:44,"I'm honestly in culture shock reading all of this. If a store clerk here reminds a customer that they can't enter the store without a mask, the customer will turn around and do it. They may sound a bit miffed and complain, but they will do it.

That someone would outright refuse to put on a mask and try to shop anyway is completely unfathomable to me, and I can't fully comprehend how entitled those people must feel.

It's not about personal freedom. The store should have the freedom to implement rules, the store clerk should have the freedom to work their minimum wage job safely, and other customers should have the freedom to move around without having to dodge people who can't follow rules.

I can't help but feel that everyone in the chain feels like they can't be bothered to do their job, up to the very tippy top; no wonder things are going sideways."

2020-07-29 18:42:33,"It should be the police who deal with customers who wont wear masks.  Stores should have a policy of calling the police when a customer refuses to wear a mask or leave the store.  

There are obvious problems with this.  A store that calls the police on a customer may well lose that customer for good, especially if there are competing stores without such a policy.  In addition, in an area with no compulsory mask laws, police may not come promptly or at all, leaving unarmed and untrained store personnel to deal with the problem.

Existence of an enforced mask law lets all customers know that their refusal to wear a mask will necessarily get them involved with the police and arrested or dead if they persist in refusing.  But until that point, requests to wear a mask will be ignored or rejected by some people, and unless these people are rare, the pandemic will continue in the area.

The solution is for states with mask laws and low rates of infection to force anyone who comes from high-rate areas to quarantine for two weeks.  Once this policy is established, states will be able to deal with the pandemic even if other states have not, so that those other states are free to continue their ineffective policies or adopt new ones from among the policies that worked in the states and countries that are dealing successfully with the problem.

At this point, a national policy requiring masks would not work."

The state government is still working out how to handle people that fail to wear masks when required, right now it's in the hands of the Health department."

Interesting position.

So, if we allow *those* people to break the law, what happens when others take advantage of this unwillingness to enforce the law and come into a store without a shirt, or without shoes? Do we let them slide as well, out of a fear that confronting them makes things worse? Where exactly do you draw the line then, in terms of the willingness to not enforce the law?"
2020-07-29 20:18:14,"The farm supply store where I purchased my horse and chicken feed (part of a fairly large upper-Midwest chain) last week placed signs stating they want everyone to either use a card or pay with exact change if using cash. While I find this to be a not unreasonable request, it also seems hypocritical and ridiculous since they don't require masks for anyone, enforce any social distancing or provide any type of protective equipment for employees. Since I am someone who usually pays cash, I told management-I'll make sure I have exact change when you start to require masks. And while you're at if, if you are so concerned about employees touching cash, give them some access to gloves and hand sanitizer.

Mostly, I have shifted as much of my purchasing as possible to another regional store that requires masks for everyone and has taken multiple steps to keep both shoppers and employees safe."

Separately, I returned a UHaul rental the other day and the employee who met us wore no mask! I emailed the local Uhaul office and they said, ""Sorry to have made you feel  uncomfortable"".

I simply don't believe that's the case, because no state allows a worker who refuses an offer of work to continue to collect unemployment. That is fraud. If employers have contacted workers to let them know they should return to their jobs and some refuse, those workers should be reported to the state unemployment department so their benefits can be stopped. If employers do not report those workers, then I don't see how the employers can complain that the problem is the amount of the benefit. The fault lies with the employers."

Do not give $1200 cash to undocumented immigrants. Will be used as a cudgel on moderate (frontline) Democrats in fall elections. Reduce income threshold for full money to 50-60 K. funds toward public health costs or new OSHA Covid 19 standards. These standards would give an objective basis to Mitch McCornell’s liability wants.

Many of them slip back into familiar tropes of the past, such as that extending the current emergency unemployment program, when unemployment due to the virus rivals the Great Depression, will discourage the unemployed from going back to jobs which no longer exist: typical Republican circular reasoning.  

How about this: have Republican donors certify they are offering a job right now to each unemployed person recieving benefits, or for those not guaranteed a Republican work opportunity at least as good as their old job, extend the benefits.

Let them remove these line items completely from THIS package, then introduce them as separate legislation. Let them justify that expense at that time.

Any Republican seat up for grabs should be flipped.

I don't think people understand how wealthy our current representatives-on both sides-truly are. Over half of them are millionaires, and all of them make well over six figures in total income. They also have excellent healthcare. They all benefited from Trump's 2.3 billion dollar tax cut. None of them are being affected by this economic crisis and pandemic like the average citizen. At least the Democrats are trying to give us all lifeboats.

The fact that the GOP is worried that the extended unemployment benefits are too generous and could discourage We the People from going back to our underpaid (now nonexistent) jobs should tell you something.  That extra $600 was a lifeline to most of us. Now we are about to fall off a cliff and there is no bottom that anyone can see.

Paulson then agrees to a plan of direct capital injections into the banks that he had earlier flatly rejected out of hand.

The president was all in a rush to get the states to ""re-open"" and we're seeing the terrible consequences now. The economy is poised for a record GDP deficit for the second quarter of 2020, one that will obliterate the hopeful gains of March and April. This comes from not having a plan to fight the Covid-19 because his focus was on economics, not the public's health. He has woefully failed at both and we are about to pay an even greater terrible national price as August beckons.

Mark Meadows, the president's acting Chief of Staff, threw icy water on yesterday's ""negotiations"" on Capitol Hill. ""We're not even close"" to a package to alleviate the suffering of those millions who lost their jobs and, in less than a week's time, may be on the street.

My state is now posting its highest rate of hospitalization since the pandemic began. Can someone kindly explain the logic of closing in March when numbers were lower (the right move) while dithering over the decision when the numbers speak so loudly they come from the grave? 

Ideally, a functional president would announce today a hard, nation-wide lockdown, mandatory mask-wearing, and nationwide online learning. Those steps would crush the curve, give us time to prepare buildings for modified in-school learning, and SAVE LIVES. 

But we don't have a leader, so it's essential that leadership come from governors, mayors, and the press. We can debate the minutia of how and why we have to do this, but do it we must. 

Dr. Gupta and a Yale epidemiologist have said it's ""reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous"" --their words--to open and that they have no intention of sending their own children. Dr. Fauci is coming around to that view too.

One family member teachers won, and will continue virtual teaching, the other lost. As the county begins to outline what “real” school will be like, anticipated restrictions will make it unrecognizable.  Students will be unable to leave their seats for lunch, recess or comfort breaks (outside of strict limits). No papers will be passed between teacher and student. No contact between teacher and student. In essence, it will be a virtual classroom in a school room but with severe restrictions on activity and mobility. The kids will be miserable and the teachers, who will wear masks, will be severely restricted in their ability to teach. How this will be a better alternative to home-based virtual school is beyond me, except allowing parents to leave for work who have no other childcare options, which is a different but very real issue. Perhaps we should look for better alternatives to the latter issue than pretending that school’s open.

Back in the bad old days of March, April and May when NY and the rest of the Northeast was being ravaged by Covid one was filled with both despair and fear.  We knew so little about what was happening and what to do.

Each day I watched Gov. Cuomo's pressers and shared with him and his staff etc. the dilemma of constantly changing information and advice as we struggled to try and understand this virus.

Over time, he and his team of experts did develop a cogent response -- one that has, at least for now, been relatively successful.

But this begs the question, having learned so much, why are infection and death rates now spiking elsewhere?

Simply put, I believe that most of the people now contracting Covid are either arrogant or careless (or both).  We know how to stem the spread but the virus keeps spreading anyway.

People in those ""red"" states are now bringing this plague upon themselves.  They refuse to wear masks and keep social distance.  They congregate in bars, restaurants, beaches etc.

If there's economic news here it is the refusal of Republicans to support their people during this crisis, their mad insistence on giving trillions to the hugely rich and largely (in this context) irrelevant corporations; their demented reliance on discredited economics chestnuts born of class prejudice and greed, like the bizarre insistence that sending people money to live on and support banks, retailers, landlords, restaurants will discourage them from ever working again.

Another of his good ideas was to limit the length of bills to two pages. I believe that would have a very positive impact on government, politics and the relation the general population has with the former two.

It is unclear where he contracted the disease. What is clear is that he was in Tulsa, that he was not wearing a mask and that there were several staffers in Tulsa that later tested positive. I hope everybody - no matter the party - now realizes that Covid-19 is A KILLER and that everybody needs to protect themselves as best as they can.

I am saddened by the complicity that the wholly politicized issue of mask-wearing has played in his death, and in a President that has pushed the anti-mask narrative. That fact cannot be decoupled from his death. What all of us as Americans must now wrestle with is this -- do we want our deaths complicated by the misguided and misinformed policies of this Administration? It's not just encouraging non-masking at a rally (I think rallies are done for now anyway), it's pushing businesses and schools to open without investing in the protection and testing infrastructure needed for those things to be opened safely at scale. Cain may have died for this cause, but I refuse. Rest in peace, Mr. Cain. The rest of us wish to live."

2020-07-30 16:32:08,"For anyone still in the grips of Covid denial, this has been an extraordinary week thus far. The death of Herman Cain follows the announcement on Monday that Trump's national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, tested positive for Covid-19. Yesterday, TX congressman Louis Gohmert tested positive. Gohmert had been vehemently anti-mask, and even blamed his diagnosis on the mask he was sometimes required to wear. As for Herman Cain, in the run-up to Trump's Corona Festival, aka the Tulsa rally, Cain tweeted ""Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!"" That tweet has since been deleted. However, beyond Cain, the collateral damage in Tulsa included Trump campaign staff, members of the Secret Service and the general public as Tulsa saw a subsequent  spike in the coronavirus.

These high-profile instances of Covid-19 underscore the sheer hypocrisy of Trump and those under his sway. The pandemic is real. Membership in the Republican elite does not grant immunity from the disease. However, masks, social distancing and all the other widely known preventative measures go a long way to keeping everyone safe."
2020-07-30 15:24:05,"You’ve got to wonder if the president and his party have a death wish.  

The economy is dropping like a stone, and anybody with more than than a thimbleful of sense knows that getting control of infection rates is a critical prerequisite to getting it back on track—and that doing nothing to help those who are falling into the economic abyss in the meantime will just hasten the drop.   So the president’s answer is to rule pandemic over by executive fiat and change the conversation to law-and-order and confederate memes?  And the GOP’s answer is to make those at the bottom choose between life and livelihood?  Because why?  Only those who are already wealthy are worthy of help?

Remember when Republicans used to act like they were the adults in the room, taking care of business?  When James Carville had to remind Democrats it’s “the economy, stupid”?  How could anybody think the president and his party are the ones who can get the American economy back on track when they seem to be doing their dead level best to push it further off the rails?"

Cain was admitted to an Atlanta-area hospital on July 1, 2020 for treatment of COVID-19, two days after he was told he tested positive for the virus. His staff said there is no way to be certain where or in what way he contracted the disease. He had attended a Trump rally in Tulsa 12 days earlier without wearing a mask. Earlier on the same day he went to the hospital, Cain praised South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem for not requiring masks at an upcoming Trump campaign event, saying ""Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump.

Many republicans started to question their support for Trump when he insulted Senator McCain but the last three months have been sheer bedlam under Trump. Bailout money is being plundered, and protests against racism has reached fever pitch. Conservatives are not racists nor do we condone the willful squandering of our national treasury.

He apparently tweeted with contempt about masks, saying before July 4th and Mt Rushmore that ""PEOPLE ARE FED UP"" with the issue. Then during his hospitalization, his spokespeople asked people to continue prayers for him, deferring to the stronger God (stronger than coronavirus, I presume) that he believes in.

I surely hope his brethren conclude that God did answer prayers, if indeed they're true believers. As in, their stronger God realized the need for a strong message to be sent. One that says, embrace  some God-given humility, and work in good faith with the world's God-given scientific expertise, and look to be your God-given brother's keeper. That all seems very Christian to me."
2020-07-30 18:07:51,"Dr. Marr references a pre-publication article concerning the spread of Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. It concludes: ""aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship"". The details of how they arrive at their conclusions almost requires a PhD to understand. 

However, advanced theoretical modeling is not necessary. The hypothesis of aerosol transmission through ventilation systems can be easily studied. The study must be done during an active outbreak. As many vents delivering air to the site of transmission should be sampled and evaluated for the presence of virus. If positive, the insides of the vent system, particularly any areas where there is a buildup of debris should be examined with electron microscopy for the present of ribosomes. That would suggest the possibility that the virus may have been replicated within the system. The ribosomes would be a ""force multiplier"" for the exhaust from the system.

This hypothesis may be unlikely but it is not impossible. If such simple studies validated the theory in whole or in part, it would be an immense advance for the control of the pandemic. 

As an aside, some have claimed that the virus would disappear when the weather became warmer. Phoenix, AZ has proved the opposite. The outbreak has soared. Could that be because many contaminated air cooling ventilation systems were turned on?"

And those are only two examples out of millions  starting this weekend - all of which will have been avoidable. 

This is an appalling and shameful debacle. We have known about this deadline since relief legislation was first passed; we have seen roll backs on reopenings for a month now; while personally rich and corporate-backed lawmakers show little to no concern.

GOP members of Congress mock the economic ravages of the pandemic - no more jobless benefits, no aid to schools, no aid to states and municipalities.  The GOP Congress has have already rewarded their corporate sponsors and CEO's with trillions.

Cruz is a hopeless case and not up for re-election this year, so he thinks he doesn’t have to lift a finger, but Cornyn is fighting for his job in November—you would think he’d be eager to do something useful.

They are skin and bones and have all of the physical traits of an older human.  This virus is so disruptive and frightening that the most knowledgeable men and women are fearful to contradict optimistic declarations, or tell the awful truths themselves.  Do not allow crowded pre schools to operate.  Do not allow schools with the lack of preparation as it is tho open.  There will be terrible consequences.  And if tears could wash Covid-19 away, the tears of  loved ones of sick and dying students, staff, and support people would wash this plague away.The people these young children can infect will overwhelm us.

Without that full weekly amount, people will lose their homes and many, many kids and adults will go hungry.

I find it unconscionable that these lawmakers could simply walk out and turn their backs on people instead of thinking of THEM before their own need to leave Washington.

In its stead, we have an infantile septuagenarian whose life is a twitter account compulsion  who finally bothered to tweet condolences for Herman Cain's death (who led Trump's Black Voices For Trump)- hours after tweeting his support of a Pizza Parlor on Long Island.

The Republican Party is a joke. No black man who had fathered 5 children with 3 women could ever have become the GOP's nominee for president. But Donald Trump? No problem. I give Cain credit for being entertaining in a non-nasty way during his short time as a presidential candidate. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert sure loved the guy for the material he provided."
2020-07-30 22:03:08,"Prior to the pandemic, Trump was eager to claim that the robust economy was all due to him and his policies - never mind the considerable leg up he had received from President Obama. However, over the last three months, the G.D.P. has undergone an astounding, record-breaking contraction, the equivalent of a 32.9 percent annual rate of decline. Trump's policies, which attempted to force the economy to reopen, but did little to address the pandemic, have created an economic crisis of historical proportions. Moreover, as many states struggle to contain the coronavirus, it is now very clear that the economy will undergo further devastation.

Americans have experienced extraordinary suffering under the Trump administration throughout the pandemic. First there has been the vast, needless deaths of so many people. If that wasn't cause enough for despair, there is also the financial toll as millions of Americans see their lives upended and their dreams crushed. This G.D.P. belongs to the G.O.P., and Trump, above all others must be held accountable for it."

I would almost compare this to the conduct of the Hoover administration after the 1929 stock market crash led to the Great Depression.  Back then the Republicans insisted on ""balancing the budget"" even though doing so actually led to a decrease in Federal spending even as the private sector was collapsing.

The result: a massive deflationary spiral as consumption collapsed and unemployment skyrocketed.

But at least Hoover never reacted to his ""own goal"" debacle by then threatening to postpone or cancel Election Day.

""Older children and adults had similar levels of genetic fragments of the virus, by one important measure. Children younger than 5 had significantly lower levels. Still, the upper limit of the range was comparable to that of older children and adults.""  Young children had lower levels of PCR cycle count, which is INVERSELY related to amount of virus.  So what was found was that young children had much MORE viral RNA than adults although the SMALLEST amounts were comparable.  This error should be corrected."
2020-07-30 20:36:03,"China could have stopped this at their border just as Trump could have stopped this at the border, but they both lied. 

Or maybe they lied in hindsight, maybe they didn’t realize the full danger of the virus, but a least China learnt from the effect of the Virus while Trump did not. It took dismal polling before Trump learned the effects, but not the effects on life but to his polling numbers. 

Trump has lead Americans down the garden path to see his name in lights but he didn’t count on a man made disaster taking out the power and now all Americans can see what the rest of the world already knew, Trumps total incompetence."

It goes round at will, and it’s speeds soar and ebb.  After any days of non stop activity some of the cars start to loosen from their anchors.  Over many days some are hanging loosely, but all are on a course to crash eventually if the power can not be stopped, and the cars filled with people are not rescued.  Scores of people argue on the ground trying to decide what has happened, why and what must they do.  They argue, and they fight, and a use one another.  No one knows what to do.  They tell the people in the cars to sit quietly, but none heed their messages.   How could this be happening.  What is happening!  There are no answers.  And the World- the nations on the wheel and MOST of the people inside will perish, if an answer is not found.  This fantastic, unreasonable tale, is as absurd  as the help we have been offered by “do this- no do that-maybe that-ingest that, no this. It is on surfaces, it is in the air. It is not on surfaces.

The US Senate goes on vacation for a month without addressing the largest self-inflicted US crisis ever. As some nations in the world starts to rebuild, the US President and the Senate GOP majority are adamant on making the US crisis much worse. 

Record decline in GDP, record unemployment, deaths rising again, testing failing and late, tracing impossible, pandemic data flawed and manipulated, evictions and foreclosures expected in record numbers. And your Senate majority and President simply can't care!

With no extra public money to support the unemployed, or the municipalities, utility companies, the cities and states, spending will plummet and many more jobs will be lost. Public entities will be forced to fire millions more. The spending dependent US economy will crash spectacularly, and it doesn't matter how many trillions the Federal Reserve print and pump into the leaking lead balloon, aka the US stock and financial markets.

If there is a plan it is the most sinister plan ever.

Funny how they had no problem with giving away trillions in tax cuts to the top .01%.

Their adherence to ideology over facts is going to drive this country into the next great depression and it will once again be left to a Democratic administration to pick up the pieces.  The only question is will the Republicans have a big enough minority in the Senate to still block meaningful progress, because you know for sure that they will try.

2020-07-30 22:55:17,"I have a simple idea for an emergency way to aid the unemployed receiving benefits as a temporary good Samaritan way to save people and prevent precipitous disaster; Being that the unemployment rate is approximately 10 percent as I read a ways back, all states should condemn the Republicans for initiating deliberate chaos by their apathy and take responsibility to give additional state benefits. With a 10 percent unemployment rate, distribute the costs of temporary additional assistance across the 90 percent employed in a simple tax of their discretion to pool for distribution to the 10 percent unemployed. It could be temporary sales taxes, or income payroll deductions perhaps, but the simple idea of our government is to do the will of it's people to further progress and provide for the general welfare of everyone. I'm certainly willing to endure additional taxation to help my fellow countrymen. It would be a small contribution from the 90 percent combined to help the 10 percent. State Legislators could pass it very quickly if they chose. Simply waiting for the Republican Senate to get a heart is wasted time. Don't be paralyzed by TV."

Louis XV didn't care about the deluge as long as this would happen after his departure, while here the federal government doesn't seem very concerned if the flood happens in front of their own eyes.

This is an unprecedented national emergency that if not addressed with the sense of dire urgency it demands of our political leaders, will consume us in what will most certainly amount to a major depression. It’s time for Senate Republicans to wake up from their petty and myopic bickering and to see the conflagration that’s on the verge of burning down the economy.

The G.D.P drop is no surprise. When the engine of growth of the nation, small businesses are ordered to shut down by govs for 4 months there can be only 3 outcomes; loss of jobs, tanking of the economy and destruction of livelihoods of millions of working Americans. This is the only pandemic that has resulted in such a mass devastation and the purpose of containing the pandemic has still to be fulfilled. In this century alone we have had the HIV pandemic, SARS-Coronavirus pandemic and Swine flu pandemic but none of these pandemics had such a knee jerk reaction that has caused devastation and disruption of the lives of millions of Americans. Trump was ill advised by the medical experts and his economic advisers did not warm him in strong words the damage that shutting down businesses will cause. 

The dysfunctional congress at an impasse is no surprise. this all or none negotiating stand will leave the unemployed from getting any benefits instead of just enough to get through these difficult times. Tomorrow the benefits run out and if congress leaves on a vacation then what are the unemployed to do. Politicians are playing with the lives of Americans."

The president says ""Wear a mask"" but refuses, except for one instance, to wear one himself. He complained that testing only uncovered more cases of the virus which ""made us look bad."" There's still no federal top-down distribution or supply chain for PPE's. Wait; it only gets better.

Mitch McConnell dug in his heels and said that there will be no generosity for struggling renters and homeowners in the latest puny Republican ""care package."" It's a dis-incentive to work. Lindsey Graham says ""Over my dead body."" Rand Paul frets about the cost. States and local governments are in the ninth inning for balancing their books. 

The president is rushing to reopen schools so the most vulnerable among us--our children--are put at risk so that he can be elected on a backdrop of normalcy. As kids and teachers drop like flies.

No vaccine until 2021 but, hey, try hydroxychloroquine.

 Or bleach.

Apparently, the same property where the seeds of our destruction can and have been planted through telecom, broadcast, and the internet in violation of ""fairness"" where rational and intelligent discourse is in a battle with espionage, profiteering, and political tricks.

The kid had his own mask on, thank goodness, but the exec. could have called his order in, gone to a kiosk and ordered or picked up that half pound of bologna from a pre-sliced stand.

He chose instead to interact with employees in this manner. And mingle with our many elderly customers in this manner. This behavior  from an executive with an international corporation that did not allow US employees to wear masks until recently, despite watching Covid tear through its employees in Europe six months ago.

The President spews dangerous nonsense, and is allowed to do so for political reasons.  He is incapable, dangerous, and has overseen the deaths of approximately 90,000 additional people than should have died.  

The President, and the Republican Party (who have not used their power to control and redirect him) are ultimately responsible for this situation as they haven't even tried to use best practice as determined by medical and science experts.  Instead, they are snake oil salesman.  They first recommend the elderly take risks for the sake of the country in order to keep our economy going, and now push for the children of this country to be put in harms way simply because they are clueless.  We still do not have the necessary PPE.

Major political parties come and go.  The dominant Whig Party collapsed in 1854 when they split and either joined the anti-slavery Republican Party (I know, the irony is astounding) or the short-lived Constitutional Union Party.  Perhaps the timing is right for the current Republican Party to break up and re-invent itself.  No one will miss them as they've been gone for over 60 years starting with Nixon's Southern strategy, the Moral Majority (yet another oxymoron), to the current political organization that is weak on the economy, weak on national defense, and on just about everything else but the telling of lies and the misuse of religion to remain in power."

Endless hearings and investigations of HRC followed, culminating in an 11 hour, no holds barred, public grilling. Her private email server was the only ‘useful’ byproduct of their investigations. And, although it was as close to a nothing burger as one could imagine, it served to critically damage her candidacy. 

Now we have congressional Republicans trying to punish and intimidate out-of-work, low wage workers in order to push them into unsafe jobs. Meanwhile the administration’s mismanagement is already responsible for the deaths of, conservatively, tens of thousands. 

Sadly, there’s no reason to think Republicans won’t whistle by the deaths of thousands more Americans if it means they can preserve their political power and keep an unfit president in office. The Benghazi sham may have been shamelessly cynical, but the current endeavor is so far out of bounds as to be criminal.

2020-07-29 17:56:26,"""We really don't care.""---DJT

And that, in a nutshell, sums up the Trump Presidency. Millions are about to lose their lifelines, facing evictions, foreclosures & bankruptcies, and this is the message Donald Trump wants to send.

“We really don’t care,”

The fact that he repeated it for emphasis.... again, the majority will always vote against their best self interest because they're motivated by subconscious bias, herd mentality, fear, insecurity, etc. 

The worst part is that Trump isn't even trying to be a super-villain or be malicious- he really isn't. He really and literally lacks the capacity to grasp anyone else's situation or point of view. He grew up in wealth; he grew up in comfort; he grew up in a controlled environment that catered to his ego. He is incapable of having empathy.

I don't blame him; I blame the people who voted for him, the people that enabled and rationalized him, and the people who cared more about pop culture and must-see tv rather than going out to vote or contribute."

The fact is the government has very dire information about the coronavirus  that it has not released and is not being relied upon. In fact the President is publicly contradicting the findings, and encouraging people to behave contrary to the findings of his own investigation.
Mr. Clyburn I am sure many thousands of people thank you as I do.   But your letters will be met on deaf ears.  Your letters it is sad to say will have as much impact on public policy as do the people who write letters to the NYTimes Comments section.  With this President every word he says is absolute, unless he alters it.  Trump’s words originate in his psyche and imagination.  We are being encouraged by him to behave in ways that will kill many thousands of us, and sicken thousands of others.  We are his puppets."

What masks if any are effective against virus transmission, or against significantly larger bacteria? What size is the covid 19 virus?  What sizes are coronaviruses in general? Do any masks prevent both droplet transmission and airborne, or one, or neither? 

At what temperature can covid 19 no longer survive? Does ultraviolet light kill it? Which wavelength? 

There's more but anyone who cannot answer these basic questions does not understand key fundamentals that would or would not support mask-wearing as an effective measure to curb this or any virus’ transmission."

Worse, in most cases, the families have lost a source of income for their livelihood.  Worst, some families may have lost their only source of income jeopardizing their health, education and well being.

Maybe it’s time to think about starting to begin to pull together and do what we know works for us here in the US.

Now all the other roommates also are being tested and staying home until they have results. As a high risk Mom 2,500 miles away, in a red zone state, I’m helpless.

The job posting report is inherently flawed because it relies on business self-attestation.  The dimwit legislators need to ask the techies what is the estimate of fake job postings from their respective companies and subsidiaries?  Business has a bias to report positive numbers in order to keep money flowing from government and related grants and contracts, that is, from the only sources keeping most of them afloat at this time.  My experience in business and labor suggests that fully 30% of job postings are fake even in the best of times, 40% in the worst, such as now."

There is a flaw in the human condition that permits this. It seems to me that Americans still have not fully grasped that this pandemic will be with us for years vaccine or no vaccine. There may not be a vaccine; there be one that is 50% effective. It is up to each of us to obey guidelines. History will record the deaths and the wrath of the pandemic of 2020-202?."

What's astonishing is that it was obvious from the start that the right wing ""narrative"" would easily be proven wrong, but they went with it anyway and used it as an excuse NOT to take more drastic action. Now, here we are, the lag is gone, and instead of solutions, I'm sure they're out looking for new excuses and narratives."

However, with advanced medical treatment and the ability to lockdown whole countries and/ or states, coupled with an effective publicly controlled track and trace system for all those infected, the US should not be experiencing this massive number of deaths.
Whether you are for or against Trump, your President needs to get a grip fast and stop this onslaught of avoidable deaths. A failure to do this will lead to the deaths of many tens of thousands of American citizens to die a cruel and lonely death as a result of this uncontrolled virus.

Yep, Trump doesn’t care because it is beyond him.

Here are the deaths per million population as of yesterday: USA: 456, Mexico 356, Canada 242 and Germany 110. You can pretty much rank the effectiveness of government in exactly the same way, only the inverse: Germany, Canada, Mexico and dead last, the USA. There's no shadow of a doubt that US governmental incompetence is the main cause of Covid-19 death in America. Trump and the Republicans can spin and lie all they want.

As far as enforcement goes, businesses that wish to remain open should be required to kick offenders out at the door, or hire someone to do so. No more handwritten notes at entrances- a government-issued mandate statement in bold letters is the only way. Enforcers should be empowered to involve law enforcement if need be, and government-funded if business owners cannot afford to pay them.

Gohmert's diagnosis occurred only because he was scheduled to fly down to TX with Trump, and anyone in close proximity to Trump must be tested in advance. 

These high-profile instances of Covid-19 underscore the sheer hypocrisy of Trump and those under his sway. The pandemic is real, and not even membership in the Republican elite grants immunity from the disease.

Presumably, at the time he was tested, Gohmert was asymptomatic. He has  also been very vocal about not wearing a mask, one can only imagine how many of his staff and colleagues have been exposed to the coronavirus through him. Indeed, throughout Washington, D.C. there must surely be a significant  number of people who have contracted Covid-19 thanks to the intransigence of people like Gohmert who are in a position to know better and do better."

So far, we have purchased a laptop computer, a stand for her iPad, and cables and adapters so she can be prepared to teach remotely, either at school or at home (should she get ill so she can keep teaching at home). Her work PC computer stopped working this morning. 

She spent many hours gathering materials for her students, putting them in paper bags, and then standing in the parking lot at school to hand them out to parents and greet her students as they drove up. She was not paid for any of this time, nor the many weeks she spent this summer prepping for the new year. 

She is told she needs to be “live” with the students for nearly 3 hours each day, plus 30 minutes for her 1 ELL student (English Language Learner). Other than those expectations, there’s been scant information or resources provided on HOW to do this. 

She’d much rather be in the classroom with her students, but the current situation makes that unwise for all concerned. 

From site admin, to district offices and local school boards, to state and federal officials, there has been a very long history of inadequate support for teachers. Lack of materials is a constant each year. Lack of support staff is the same. 

And teachers are now to trust these same people, who can’t provide regular supplies, consistent support personnel, safe classrooms, etc during a regular year... are going to magically do all that and more during a pandemic?"

It includes slashing by two-thirds the $600-per-week unemployment payments that workers have received since April and providing tax cuts and liability protections for businesses.

House Democrats in May approved a $3 trillion relief package that amounts to their opening offer: a sweeping measure that contains a number of Democratic priorities, including an extension of the jobless aid, nearly $200 billion for rental assistance and mortgage relief, $3.6 billion to bolster election security and additional aid for food assistance.
The two paragraphs are from the NyTimes 7/28/20

With a difference of $2 trillion between the two parties why is the focus on Unemployment benefits for about an 11.5 % rate? (and how many are actually receiving the benefits?)

Elementary education was tolerable and the preschool programming was a laughable attempt, but the toddlers only got an optional brief Zoom call with the primary instructor. You can imagine how effective that was. Lead teachers for all grades worked to facilitate remote education, assistant teachers did nothing. That’s not an exaggeration. They were expected to contribute nothing and that’s what they did. All continued to be paid their full salaries.

This arrangement was far from ideal but could be excused. Everyone was confused and no one had experienced anything like this. Now that the school year is close to starting again, some of those teachers are advocating for the same plan, outright stating they should continue to be paid their full salary while doing dramatically less or absolutely no work.

I realize this doesn’t apply everywhere. I know some teachers are spending countless hours making dramatic shifts in how they provide education and I applaud those efforts, but that dedication isn’t universal."

The $600 unemployment benefit will end on Friday because the GOP Senate and the White House did not see the urgency of passing the bill. But don't forget that the House passed a bill in May that is three times larger and includes  the $600 benefit intact.

The Virus death toll in the U.S. tops 150,000 fatalities. This headline speaks to the lack of a national policy to combat the virus from the trump administration since January.

Wearing Masks in public is a proven effective measure for keeping people safe from catching the virus but many U.S. citizens who listen to the Fake announcements from the president refuse to follow this safeguard. Look at 
Louie Gohmert, who's refused to wear a mask, and now tests positive for Covid-19

Jim Clyburn sends a letter to the White House Coronavirus Task Force asking for more transparency. They're not doing very much so there won't be too much clarity coming.

Finally, 
Once again it seems that the Coronavirus is taking advantage of the lack of a national organized response to continue it's spread across the country. Something that Dr. Fauci has been waning about all along and trump has been unwilling or unable to do since January.

Both are blatant lies. The CDC reports an estimated 24,000-62,000 flu deaths for the period 1 Oct. 2019 to 4 April 2020.

This piece, for example, says that “Republicans in the Senate have called for scaling [the benefit] back to $200 per week.”

This is blatantly untrue. In the spring, Congress - including a majority of democrats - voted to provide the $600 benefit until July 31 when, as a matter of course, it would revert to zero. By proposing a new weekly benefit of $200 the Republicans are proposing a $200 increase over the status quo. Government benefits are not a ratchet such that, once they are granted for a limited period they cannot be re-evaluated and there is some guarantee they will continue unchanged forever. By the same token, if the democratic proposal to provide a $600 benefit through January were enacted, would The Times write that democrats voted to “slash” the benefit effective February 1?

   The lab, in Wuhan, China, then somehow let the Covid-19 virus out and the story goes from there to touch any political opponent you happen to have. 

HOWEVER, the 1619 Project of the future cooked up by gifted finction writers of THAT era will have that era's preferred political/social enemy of our day, perhaps a Trump or a Pelosi ot a player to be named later will become THE villain of the coronavirus and everything going back to the close of World War Two will be warped and retold to sell that entirely fictional narrative.

I can tell you I could not afford my mortgage and other expenses without my retirement income from 25 years of military service and my wife's retirement income years of military service and current well-paying job. Trump and Republican lackeys expect people to live on $200 a week? That to augment paltry unemployment benefits that probably are less than that? Is poverty the life condition they want most Americans to be in? Let's take away their salaries and access to all monetary income like stocks and hidden slush funds.

But 6 months into the pandemic the US still do not have a workable plan. The pandemic infrastructure is not established, neither on test and trace nor PPE and other equipment. The US data structures doesn't work and at least some numbers are obviously ""cooked"", and you simply can't navigate on flawed or deliberately manipulated data. The US still do not closely monitor excess deaths, so apart from a few competent states no one knows the real gross toll of the pandemic. 

The virus can't care for political orientation, but somehow there's a sudden sharp change in cases in the ""red"" states, and only the ""red states. The ""blue"" states seems unaffected by the change of data management from CDC to HHS. It is not possible without other significant changes in the ""red"" states absent in the ""blue"" states. NYT should dig into this strange phenomena. 

There's still no plan for economic support of citizens, municipalities, cities and states badly affected by the stalled/crashed real economy. You can argue it is rather early to plan for recovery, but to control the virus, the families, municipalities, utilities and state structures must be kept running.

Are your government agencies and Senate majority trying to test how much worse they can make the pandemic ruin the US?

Meanwhile, our neighbor to the north has closed its border to visitors from our disease-ridden, violent country. And on the same day, Canada had 11 deaths resulting from covid-19 infection.

This is one sick country we live in."
2020-07-28 11:19:30,"The Republicans want to reduce the Federal unemployment benefit from $600 to $200. I can see some logic to this. Obviously the extra $600/week added to the State unemployment payment did allow many to ""earn"" more unemployed than they did while working. Of course this begs the question of ""How did these people survive on what they were getting paid at their job?"". I think a tiered payment schedule which would still supplement the State benefit but would also make going back to work (so long as the employer has taken proper safeguards against Covid-19) would be a good compromise."
2020-07-28 11:12:36,"It's beyond depressing to wake up and read these Coronavirus Daily Updates. The catalog of rising infections and deaths are bad enough, especially when the weekly or monthly unemployment figures are released. They simply add to the landscape of present-day America that is a wasteland of lost opportunity and useless death. No; the president didn't cause the virus; he didn't import it. But he is, was and is always responsible for it. He ignored the central core of his oath of office: ""...to preserve, protect and defend.""

And making it a lot worse is the recalcitrance of Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans who simply cannot bring themselves to human decency, let alone generosity, to even begin to consider the end-of-world consequences for millions of Americans whose lives will be forever changed when Saturday morning rolls around. That's August 1st, but the Republicans will already be getting ready to leave town for another interminable ""recess,"" having achieved nothing in the way of relief for struggling citizens.

As has been said elsewhere, Republicans' primary foci are not Joe and Jane Paycheck. They are running behind the CEO's of business and industry, so very concerned that they do not incur lawsuits or other liabilities for failing to institute protective procedures for returning employees, folks already skittish about going into the waters knowing there's a something out there that is not exactly benign.

The first are core Trump supporters who will back him whether right or wrong. They are primarily white, working class who feel most threatened by the rise in economic and polical power of our black citizens.

The second faction is the remainder of the country who see Trump as being what this country has stood for since 1776, that everyone has the  right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"".

Don't get mad, soothe him and then do exactly as you think best. (He might move on to another visible crisis point.)   That might disarm him somewhat. Vote early. 
 However, if people would follow safety recommendations,distancing,masks, no tight gatherings, it may be possible to open in limited fashion. Trump has politicized this because he has  politicized everything. This makes everything much more difficult. It should be easy to follow recommendations that will help to save your life and the lives of your neighbors. If these reccomendations are strictly and carefully  followed, and the anger energy is spent on trying to make this work, perhaps it is possible to reopen selectively.

Hey GOP, THERE ARE NO JOBS for the unemployed - not because of Democrats, or governors, or public health officials - but because the unchecked pandemic you’ve ignored is raging across our country, and people do not feel safe.

Taking loans to give tax breaks to the rich while stripping benefits from poor children. Each instance, and there are thousands of them, just another data point in a swelling database of facts. But pressing for a reopening of the economy and schools during a pandemic while tens of millions of people have no health insurance or jobs or possibly a place to live just to improve his re-election odds is the proof positive that he has no shame.

Efforts to cut payments to these workers is a way to coerce people back into unsafe work places and to risk their lives to restart the economy to the benefit of Trumps re-election.

There's what the Republicans want, what the Democrats want, and what would be ideal. Funds for workers should never have been funnelled through the kafkaesque unemployment apparatus. 

The Republican bill cuts unemployment payments by $400, gives businesses tax cuts (more tax cuts, whoopee) and also gives them liability protections for when workers are compelled to go back to work before it's safe. Ebenezer would be proud. 

The Democrat's proposal doesn't cut unemployment payments, includes rent and mortgage help, helps out states and local governments, addresses election security, calls for proper OSHA pandemic safeguards, protects workers who report violations of those safeguards, helps families buy food. In short, the Democrats are trying to do what good governments do. 

The bill should help public schools which do not have the funds to reopen safely. The Democratic plan was put together before schools were pushed to reopen now. The Republican plan won't fund schools unless they reopen now, and such reopening is unsafe at the present time.

Both plans continue the direct payments to residents. The Republicans only want to give that money to citizens. The Democrats want to give it also to undocumented immigrants, which is only fair. Those folks are picking and processing most of our food. They are picking and processing most of the Republicans' food."

Unemployment benefits won't be enough for the ""fundamentals of food and rent and economic survival"" and yet if people DO return to work, if they can find a job, what kind of safety precautions will be put into effect and monitored to protect them, their loved ones and the public from the spread of this virus?

The health of peoples' lives and the health of the US economy are becoming akin to the chicken and the egg conundrum. Which is more crucial and important?  They are EQUALLY crucial AND important because both are a necessity to not only live but to survive.

This virus has been with us for over 7 months and neither Trump nor his administration has given any real ""leadership"" or direction in how to keep businesses or schools or other entities safe.  

Instead of trying to figure out the correct and most prudent way to proceed, Trump posts a ""video containing a series of false or misleading medical claims about the coronavirus"" on social media.

Yeah, that really helps a lot.  Thanks for the suggestion, insight and brilliant example Mr. President."

I am particularly impressed with the science-based, data-driven system he and his staff have developed to advise how and when various regions in the State reopen.

But I am troubled by one aspect in particular as evidenced by the Governor's own concern with the non-compliance of both bar owners and patrons in the State -- particularly Downstate.

Quite frankly, Governor, what I really have a hard time getting my head around is why bars are open and museums are closed?  Shouldn't it be the other way around?

I mean, think about it, how many rowdy museum-goers have you ever encountered?

Now mind you, I don't work for a museum; and I certainly do not work in or own a bar.  So I have not economic ""skin"" in my query.

Simply put, since imbibers can always buy beer and alcohol from retail outlets -- why do we even have bars open since they encourage congregating crowds?  And, since most museums are spacious and -- well, to be honest, not exactly packing them in anyway -- shouldn't we let them reopen with safe distancing requirements and safeguards.

Generally, Governor, keep up the good work.  My wife and I  particularly enjoy your Covid ""pressers"" (more sporadic now than in the past).  But really -- shut the bars and open the museums!"

No, we will not sacrifice our families or our lives    No, we will not carry the economy on our backs because our government has FAILED to protect the country or even provide the most minimal help.  No, we will not bear the brunt of lack of family leave, health insurance, sick leave, sick pay or child care.  You asked us to stop bullets with our bodies because you refused to protect our children.  You asked us to buy supplies with out meager paychecks. We are not martyrs. We are educators.  ENOUGH.

This is another massive failure by the Feds and Trump. It is so disturbing to see the government so weak and ineffective in the face of the pandemic. I cannot say enough about the incompetence of this administration."

Hats off also goes to the Governor for lowering the seven-day average of new cases from a “catastrophic” high of 10,461 to merely a “horrific” 8,243.

2020-07-28 17:55:27,"My understanding is that my union, the National Education Association the largest of the 2 is on board. I was on the picket lines in 1976 during the very last strike by teachers in Maryland and proud of it. I spent 31 years in the education biz and had the privilege of being a state teacher of the year and five years as president of my local. For quite a while I have advocated for a national work action by teachers if not a full blown national strike. The current crisis has made it imperative that the profession I love to make a bold statement about the general disregard for teachers."
2020-07-28 18:00:02,"Good. If it takes our teachers striking to teach our country’s failing leaders what’s appropriate then so be it. The best case scenario is that schools remain 100% remote (improving on what they already had to learn since March) until after the first term, when there’s a successful vaccine. There’s no other logical or humane stance in this argument. Anyone arguing otherwise isn’t prioritizing safety and lives. And, mayors and governors need to remember that their pushing schools to reopen is under duress, and is most likely going to lead to sickness and potential death. Are we ok with that? They seem to be, and that should never be ok with us. Ever."
2020-07-28 18:01:06,"So Trump didn't really care about the payroll tax? Didn't really care about the testing funds? Didn't really care about the school funds? Really, REALLY cares about his personal investments. So. Much. Winning."
2020-07-28 18:17:08,"Regarding schools, I don't understand why, for at least high schools and middle schools, everyone's not just moving to ""online synchronous learning"" -- as in, every class is taught on the sames days and at the same times as normal, but via zoom or some other online platform.

It would work for nearly all classes, except for those with lab work. I know not all families have computers, but those could be provided (our school system here in Montgomery County, MD did that after the schools were shut in mid-March). And, there's still ample time to figure out a way to provide internet access for any families that don't already have it.

I hope teachers' unions will support this. Frustratingly, the local teachers' union here actually adamantely opposed this when the schools here were shut in mid-March, based on a grabbag of specious arguments. Meanwhile, our kids basically learned nothing from mid-March through the end of the school year."

Meanwhile, the First Niece says they are all misfits. I hope Biden finds a spot for her in his Administration."

2020-07-28 18:15:28,"We are long past the point some entities, persons, institutions or social media corporations, need to be held responsible for the content of media posts on the internet.   I happened to see the video that Trump (re)posted.   Should people follow the ""supposed"" recommendations they could have serious medical consequences, including death (what do you have to lose?).   But were that the case would anybody be found responsible, civil or criminally?   Not Donald, not Twitter, not the persons who made the original post, not the ""actors"" (honestly the positions these supposed Drs stated were sufficiently alarming to make me doubt their stated medical qualifications).   We need a legal standard to hold people accountable for the content they produce or disseminate via the public internet.  Too many anonymous voices are bending the accepted standards of protected speech, in effect yelling ""fire"" in the crowded theatre.  This concept of self monitored corporate standards is a legal sham in the place accountability.

Teachers who have to go back to school in two weeks, into schools that most often lack cleaning supplies, hand soap, and proper ventilation, would love to have those tests administered in their communities."
2020-07-28 17:35:57,So the teacher's union authorizes a strike if almost impossible conditions are not met. Keep in mind that teachers are talking about striking rather than teaching healthy children who do not transmit much while healthcare workers have never uttered the word strike and they are dealing with the adult sick who do transmit. That explains why healthcare workers have become ill in substantial numbers and are cheered by their fellow citizens while no one is cheering teachers who intend to stay home until the coronavirus is vanquished. Nice.

 This is the number of deaths various European (and the UK!) countries recorded yesterday:

Germany -- 0
Italy -- 5
France -- 17
Poland -- 5

It just so happens that if you add up the populations of those countries you get about the same amount as the US.  So the total for all those countries combined is < 50.  The US?  1,079."
2020-07-28 18:06:42,"I know it can't happen in the US.

But imagine the House and the Senate came together and produced a bipartisan bill to decisively end the pandemic in the US? It can be done, and it is much cheaper than the ongoing disaster.

Sooner or later someone must start to govern the US anyway. You can't go on with this dilletante freak show for much longer. Even if lives are cheap in the US, the casualties will soon become unacceptable in more states. No one, except the ultra rich vulture capitalists, will manage without losses, and the longer the pandemic is allowed to ravage the US, the heavier the losses in lives and livelihood. Even for the somehow well off pensioners currently believing they are immune to financial loss and safely isolated from the virus."
2020-07-28 18:30:05,"Any comment board about teachers always brings out two passionate sides. One group claims the teachers are over protected, overpaid, and take 3 months paid vacation every year. The other group claims they love the work, love the kids, and do actual work during Summer months. The question I always have for the first group is ""Why are you complaining about this when you can join their ranks and enjoy all those perks?"" Never seems to be a good reason why?"
2020-07-28 18:42:09,"I see my state, a state with politicians that prostate themselves before the throne of Donald, is a “red zone” state.

As I perform only necessary shopping I am alarmed at how many people are not wearing masks or distancing, with the exception of those establishments that mandate masks and distancing.

This virus, contrary to Donald’s bloviating one day, admonishing us on another day to wear masks, then orders the states to “open”, then backtrack again (I suppose the attention span is becoming shorter everyday), will not just disappear, is not a hoax (the numbers of dead and ill will attest to that) and is no worse than the flu.

But, I survived the exodus from Europe in March with no symptoms of covid-19 but I have more fear that my fellow citizens in the “red” state of mine may infect me with their actions.

But, I look at those “red zone” states and understand why they are on the list-most are “red” states politically."

In fact, Trump is largely responsible for massive unemployment.  No shame.  No compassion.  No empathy.  Trying to think what feeling he does possess."
2020-07-28 18:46:00,"This, this is what those pro-charter schools Republican advocates have been itching for, a confrontation between Trump and a large public workers union.  If they strike will Trump act to fire them all and bust their union, as their idol Reagan did?  Can he get away with it?"
2020-07-28 18:50:24,"So Republicans can give Trump a billion and a half of our dollars to build a moat around his slightly legal DC Trump Motel de Luxe but we can't give a few hundred bucks a week to people who will spend it all in support of their local economy and maybe let their families survive another m0onth or two.

Which is OK because soon our small government elephant-afflicted friends will be establishing massive Federal Programs to transfer more cash to rich guys who already have $10,000,000,000,000 no-strings-attached welfare payments in hand.

I know my man Rob Portman is not the sharpest tool in any shed, but it must be pretty close to sinking into that overly groomed head that he is making a fool of himself and condemning his state to decades of pain and economic retardation.  To say nothing of making confetti of political principle he once claimed to hold dear.

""Aw geez"" I always knew Wisconsin would be on this list, unfortunately.  My husband and I encountered so many individuals and businesses that were so indifferent to facial coverings and some were downright hostile to us for wearing face masks.

We haven't been back to Wisconsin for two weeks simply because so many residents were rude and disrespectful towards us. I was extremely hurt by their behavior, especially being a Wisconsin native.

And to think one of my goofy nephews who lives in Wisconsin was actually planning on a family reunion in August.  The problem with him and the rest of my goofy family is that they don't think they will get this virus because they don't know anyone personally who had/has it.  They really do think the virus will infect someone else, but never them."
2020-07-28 18:57:43,"You might not know this, but for several years in Dallas ISD, teachers have been FORCED to shake hands with students or risk getting downgraded on our ""threshold greeting procedures"" by principals desperate to climb the career ladder at anyone's expense.  

For years, those of us who spoke up and said:
A.  This will spread disease among kids and adults.
B.  Adults should not be touching children.
were seen as difficult, toxic, complaining, etc by the ""reformer"" wave that has swept over Dallas ISD.

I can name 15 current secondary principals right now who relentlessly shoved this down the throats of faculty.  

Teachers are always ignored."
2020-07-28 19:20:56,"In order to make sense of the positivity rate of tests, we need to know if tests are available for non-symptomatic persons and/or those with exposures to cases or travelers from high risk states I couldn't find any information on this in the federal report. I haven't even figured this out for testing offered within my community.

Is testing available to those without medical insurance? For those with insurance, are copays required; if so, how much? What are the price ranges for covid tests for those without insurance? The issues behind these questions are important to evaluate whether testing is biased towards those with insurance and those who can pay out of pocket; conversely, is testing biased against those who can't afford it?

Are we to take this fed report as a replacement for the CDC, which has been variously reported as no longer receiving covid data directly from hospitals and no longer in control of covid data? I've been reading recent CDC bulletins: are they back in control? Or what?

Our information of covid is anything but transparent and I wonder if the federal government itself is aware of any comprehensive plan. The only thing more opaque than Trump's administration is the virus itself. But, at least, the virus is coming into view with each day of observation and intense scholarship by the scientists involved."

Esp if they also drink or eat, hard to prevent on long rides...  I am still avoiding outdoor restaurants and cafes.

Even those who try to be responsible may not suspect they are ill if asymptomatic, or get tested as needed, given how overwhelmed test sites are and the time it takes to get a result - long enough to either have gone thru a quarantine if infected, or acquire a new infection if previously uninfected."
2020-07-28 18:36:19,"Let's face it. The only way to create an environment to cope with the virus is to start over with another lockdown. There is no getting around the need to have adequate testing and contact tracing available everywhere.

If we drive the cases down below R naught, you can effectively contain the small outbreaks. You can't fight what you can't find.

Then, you have no choice but to protect the most vulnerable first. Put the resources there. 

The fools who think they have lost their ""freedom"" are just that. Fools. Restrain them by whatever means necessary.

We have the worst of both worlds until we approach the mission with a plan. The deaths will continue until we reach something approaching natural immunity. The economy will sputter and fail.

The Republican politicians have been complicit in this.

Donald Trump does not care if any of us live or die. He must be removed from office under the 25th amendment. He is a threat to the nation's security, health and welfare."

Both to other team members, other teams and, unless they are quarantine, to family members etc.

If MLB is desperate to continue this truncated ""franken-season"" then the Marlins, and any other team that may also have infections, will need to call up minor league players to fill their rosters.

How is it then that such teams could in any way be considered ""competitive""?

2020-07-28 23:05:17,"Trump exhibited again at his Misinforming Coronavirus news conference why he first, is still the immature & jealous child clown he has always been.

But it was unheard of, to ever hear a U.S. president during a Pandemic cry out in jealousy why his approval rating on handling Covid-19 isn't good; in contrast to the high approval of infectious disease medical expert Dr. Fauci.

In addition, Trump's initial desire to throw out the first pitch at the NY Yankees first home game was due to his jealousy of Dr. Fauci invited, & doing so last week in D.C. by the W.S. Champion Nationals at their season home opener; to which ""Topps"" has also put a baseball card into production. 
 
Instead of still being jealous on that sports matter, a competent president with leadership skills would be questioning why all school, college, and pro sports should even be played while under this Pandemic; yet alone why any schools should open.

But Trump continued again with his false ranting of ""Hydroxychloroquine"" being the remedy for all suffering with Covid-19; while the FDA hasn't approved it as being the answer.

Most certainly, a cognitive troubled Donald Trump also lied in the Spring of taking the drug himself. That due to two reasons:
(1) It is still assumed the mask less misinformer had never back then tested positive for Covid-19; unless he lied.
(2) One of its possible major side effects are the occurrence of brain seizures; especially with those having any history of neurological issues."

I am not going to say I am sorry that he feels no one likes him, actually, I will say he is being generous by using that terminology compared to a sane person's view of him.

Sometimes I wonder if America suffers from a kind of cultural alcoholism, whether their are beverages involved or not.  Are we a dry drunk culture, addicted, locked into cognitive dissonance prescribed by our respective tribes?

Vladimir Putin knows to divide is to conquer.  Imagine the release of the Moscow video (Trump knows how he behaved on his trip to the Miss Universe contest) what kind of leverage it would have given Melania?  She already had Stormy Daniels, the Playboy model, and the Access Hollywood video.  She could get by with a little help from a friend. Another damaging drop and the Ice Queen checks her mate.

So when Donald and Putin meet, all but the translators are sent away.  After explaining what will happen to their families, in a language Trump can’t understand, Putin asks them to translate the terms of their agreement.  

Divide and conquer, or else.

Here we are.

'Wear a mask if social distancing (6' distance) can't be maintained' is sort of a confusing message and perhaps contributing to people not wearing one while they're out and about. WA state has a state-wide mask mandate. While walking today, I saw more people without masks than with. I thought may be it's due to the 'if you can maintain social distance, don't wear' exemption. Some may think it is unnecessary to ask people to don a mask while taking a walk, but this kind of approach is what has worked in Asia to curb the infections. From the photos, it is clear social distance isn't strictly maintained when people are at the park or walking/running on trails, etc. For some, it may seem drastic to require masks all the time when you're out (for me, it isn't - I wear a mask any time I'm out of the house), but drastic times call for drastic measures.

2020-07-29 00:35:26,Where is the article on Kodak being selected to manufacture generic drug ingredients and all the other government orders making generics more accessible and cheaper? Too favorable to Trump?
2020-07-29 00:55:33,"Trump not only falsely claimed much of the U.S. as being ""Corona Free;"" but also initially dating back to January 20,  2017; that he is a legitimate ""U.S."" president; while Robert Mueller had further proved the opposite; in addition to others.

Maybe Trump meant to say in further worry of his Coronavirus disapproval rating, and ""nobody liking"" him in the U.S, as also seen by every major source's election poll, was instead that at least one particular U.S. prison was ""Corona Free"" in being able to accept him as a future lifetime inhabitant beginning at some time in 2021 after being convicted for ""You Name It."""
2020-07-29 00:49:05,"There is ,Trump, and there is the pandemic.Both are ravaging public health-the COVID-19 requires masks and social distancing-Trump requires a suspension of reason and a determination to vote him out of office in November.There will not be a vaccine against the virus before 2021, but Trump can be removed from office before that.He must be!"
2020-07-29 00:30:48,No Mr. Trump.  It's not your personality. It's your utter incompetence.
2020-07-29 00:31:11,"Trump is neither delusional or stupid. He knows exactly what he’s doing - stirring unrest, decisiveness and uncertainty - during a time when people will look to a “Savior” for the cure. We don’t need a cure from COVID or Trump, we need a cure for systemic white supremacy and the disease that got a trump elected in the first place: capitalism and greed."
2020-07-29 00:54:26,Another day and yet another blatant lie by the President.  I don't know which count is higher : The number of people in the US who have tested positive for COVID-19 or the number of blatant lies uttered by this man since he assumed office.  Its a good bet that it is the latter
2020-07-29 00:57:59,"So the places that patted themselves on the back for knocking down Covid, and shamed others for not doing so well, are finding that they rejoiced too soon. As soon as a community opens up to any degree, Covid infections quickly return. There is no outrunning this. Everyone is going to be exposed before this ends. ""Slow the spread"" at least was attainable. The change to ""stop the spread"" is foolhardy."
2020-07-29 00:52:37,"Every time he lies about the reality of the pandemic and Republicans don’t challenge him, that’s one more nail in the Republican Party’s coffin. He’s at 34% and they’re still silent.  

I’m beginning to think that what’s happening is the ultimate last laugh. That is, that the Dixiecrats joined Abe Lincoln’s Party to burn it to the ground. Ask any white Southern man who is all about his Confederate “heritage” (not hate, they say) what he truly thinks about Abraham Lincoln. Southern men are not fans of his."
2020-07-29 00:49:14,I have noticed that nationwide and state numbers have been down this week. Is it a coincidence that numbers are now reported by DHS instead of CDC?
2020-07-29 00:56:07,"I don't understand why the powers to be don't give us honest numbers about the virus.  According to the latest stats out of the CDC, hospitalizations are flat or down in 45 states.  Yet they also says ""new cases"" are at all time highs.  Either the the severity of cases is dropping rapidly or we're not being given correct numbers.  I suspect it's the later.  I know if 100 people test positive on one day they report 100 ""new"" cases.  If the same people are tested positive the next day they report another 100 ""new"" cases.  If a person dies of alcohol poisoning and is test positive it's called a covid death.  Why can't they just be honest and give us the facts?  Trump says it's improving and the Democrats say it's getting worse.  Neither have any credibility because nobody knows the real facts."
2020-07-29 00:40:18,"Trump doesn't know what day it is never mind what treatments will work on the coronavirus.

When he comes down with the virus I want to see him drink some bleach to cure it."

2020-07-29 00:52:54,"Hmmm, he wonders why people don’t like him...could it be that to most observers he is  obviously a narcissistic psychopath that is incapable of any empathy...oh and the fact he has turned the USA into a country to be equally, deeply pitied and feared by the rest of the world due to his & his administration’s outrageous ego, power driven ineptitude, and making a mockery of the truth.
Keenly & anxiously waiting for your next election. Please for the love of all that’s decent, clean this mess up USA, we beg you."
2020-07-29 00:56:22,"Well, he's technically correct that much of the US is  COVID-free. There's no COVID in my toaster or my dishwasher. Probably none in my linen closet. Probably none in vast uninhabited stretches of the west and Alaska."

They are inexpensive and widely available; they come in a variety of attractive patterns and colors; they keep us from hurting one another, and they don’t require a background check. God help us if we ever encounter an enemy whose defeat requires that we do something really hard— like ration electricity, plant a victory garden, or reinstitute the draft."
2020-07-29 01:58:25,"Perhaps,  by square mileage, the parts of the USA that are ""corona free"" -- by virtue of being UNPOPULATED -- might conceivably outweigh the parts that are riddled with Covid-19.

Then again, perhaps not. I think the latter is more likely."
2020-07-29 02:18:37,"The left seems to think that the federal government has a bottomless supply of money, and ignoring that many people are refusing to return to work when they make $1000 or more weekly on unemployment with the expanded benefit.  We are in difficult times, but people have to go back to work.  The $600/week supplement needs to end.  The Democrats cynically want to extend it through January to keep unemployment levels elevated through Election Day."
2020-07-29 02:33:18,"As someone who has bicycled, hitchhiked, and Greyhound bused across the US several times, I can attest to the truth of the President’s statement that much of the country is COVID-free.  The minor detail he left out is that this is true only because there are vast tracts without humans."
2020-07-29 01:16:44,"Check out the “doctor “ that trump referenced. Terrifying that any public official, much less the president, puts any credence on whatever drivel she spouts. 
If my town moderator quoted her publicly regarding policy, she’d by fired by the town council the next day."
2020-07-29 03:03:32,"At this point it seems like Trump is just trying to lose because he isn't interested in being president anymore.  Easy, obvious things to increase his popularity are staring him in the face.  Getting in front and leading the majority where they are already going is a sure fire way to be popular.  But Trump is too lazy to do it.  He asks, ""why can't I just absorb the popularity of something I'm not involved in?"""
2020-07-29 02:46:33,"I have taught in three Asian countries--China, Myanmar and Cambodia. My students, ages 16-25, have always worn masks when they are sick or think they might be getting ill. It is just considered common decency to not run the risk of infecting others, even with a simple cold. Even if COVID is no more dangerous than the flu (which some of the crazies in the US seem to believe), why would you run the risk of giving your neighbor the flu?

I am on an island in Thailand. There have been only two cases here, and they were months ago. Still, everybody wears masks when they go to Family Mart. And when I look at the woman behind the counter who interacts with hundreds of people a day, I'm glad we do. She shouldn't have to run the risk of any illness just to do her job.

My visa here has just been extended for an additional two months. I am very grateful. I can't get back to Cambodia, because they want a health certificate from my home country (the US). I'm not going there. Between the risk of severe illness and fascist federal troops being deployed to cities, I'm thinking of asking the Thai military junta government for political asylum."
2020-07-29 03:01:08,"I think one reason the GOP wants to make sure no one can sue if they contract covid-19 might be that the president’s constant lies about the epidemic make him, and those who aid and abet him, culpable."
2020-07-29 03:45:58,Why not give parents the choice of whether or not their children go back to school in the fall. Those parents who want their children in the classroom could send them and those who do not could learn by virtual learning. There are some parents who definitely feel their children learn better in a classroom setting with their peers. Why should those children be deprived of a classroom education.￼￼ Parents know best.
2020-07-29 03:42:16,"Most American families don’t have $400 saved for a rainy day. They couldn’t save any more than that because wages are so low. In Alabama unemployment benefits max out at $275 a week. If you are on the gig economy you can’t claim anything if you still have one job making $275. If you are working off the books (construction or restaurant work, maybe) then God bless you because you’re getting nothing and that means you aren’t eligible for the $600 either.

That $600 a week has been keeping people from going homeless and without food. It didn’t go to everybody...but hopefully someone in the family got it. When the $1200 came to us, I gave most of it to the food bank because I knew they would be busy.

This is a brutal country."
2020-07-29 01:28:30,"There was a saying; ""Credit you give yourself is not worth having"". I'm amazed how Trump supporters genuinely repeat how ""tough"" Trump is and yet he conveys so much blatant whiny emotions in regards to his ratings. This dude is in his seventies. My goodness."
2020-07-29 01:59:23,"Thank you, NY Times for saying that ""The President Falsely Claims"" in the headline. 

This is big improvement over ""unconfirmed accusations""; ""could not be substantiated""; ""baseless""; ""unsupported by the facts""; ""appears to be deceptive"".

The one I dislike the most is ""misleading"" when it describes one of Trump's lies. 

Spin is misleading. When Trump says ""we lead the world in tests"" is misleading, but could be technically true, as a sheer number of tests. (Never mind that it might take 10 days to get the results back; and, tests per capita is a thing!)

When he first said ""if we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases.” that was incorrect, but he could have just been so massively misinformed that he didn't know, and was just making something up on the spot.

When he said it the second, third, fourth etc. times then he was lying, because his staff told him it was false."
2020-07-29 02:47:23,"Trump made false claims yesterday, today, and will every day until November 3.  Thereafter, he will continue to spin lies in office or out of office until no one listens anymore.  People should stop listening now."
2020-07-29 03:36:13,"Dr. Stella Immanuel's video is impressive, impressively shocking.  After 24 hours its memory is still horrifying--medicine from the dark ages.  It is beyond my comprehension how anyone could watch it and believe her to be a credible authority on anything.   Is this the unnamed medical authority that trump cites as his continued belief in quinine (what do you have to lose)?   Perhaps the video should be available to be viewed along side trump's commentary so that people can better appreciate trump's dementia."
2020-07-29 02:48:07,Trump did not “falsely claim” much of the country was Covid-free. He lied. It’s time to call it just what it is.

That is what the extra $600 is achieving for many out of work. $200 is plenty and I think the Republicans are being quite generous.￼ If the boss reopens his company or place of business, the workers should go back. They should stop being supported and exploiting the government.￼"

2020-07-29 05:10:30,"Mr. Trump's assertion that large parts of the country are 'virus free' is perfectly true from a certain point of view.  Large areas have very low virus incidence--that doesn't mean that they're free of virus risk.  The whole nation is at virus risk and won't be relatively free of it until (if) we have an effective vaccine.  It isn't necessary to attack Mr. Trump for everything he says.  His opponents, if elected in November, won't have a more effective way of dealing with the problem than he has had if no good vaccine is forthcoming."
2020-07-29 01:57:58,"Stage One of the Trump Virus saw gutless Trump & his like administration only worry about their own political lives; instead of Americans lives, by reopening America too early with too few restrictions.

That resulted in a wide spread nationwide increase of Covid-19 plus deaths in its Part Two. Their irresponsible suggestions of opening all, including schools, will soon result in Stage Two shortly occurring this Fall.

With today's Trump Coronavirus news conference he suddenly departed early again for being in denial still of Covid-19 with no respect for the scientists & medical experts; coupled with his personal A.G. Barr's testimony of denial of the situation faced in hospitals & more; along with claiming that mail in voting would be a sham, but only against Trump; Americans may not be able to rely on, & wait for an Election if allowed to be held, yet also fairly.

Where the Election would be the prescription to rid forever of the Trump Virus; Americans may be forced to do something a lot sooner; due also to no safe vaccine being ready until closer to the Election to prevent its further spread.

Trump & Barr in tandem today, though at separate locations, again proved they care only about the narcissistic Trump. Who else would employ a William Barr, except for personal protection being thee only requirement; even if their actions kill many Americans either through Covid-19, or incited police violence and Military outfitted white supremacists deployed to their cities streets."

The astounding cruelty, hypocrisy and criminal behavior of this administration and Senate is exhausting -- and beyond belief. I never in my wildest nightmares thought the United States would find itself in a situation where we, the people, get pummeled and punished every single day -- every single day -- by those who have sworn an oath to protect Americans.

The fact that they aren't throwing every penny in the coffers to rid the US of the virus, to pay people's bills so that they don't have to worry about it during this unprecedented catastrophe, to keep people from losing their homes and their health care ... what kind of country is this? What kind of government ""leadership"" is this? This isn't what our soldiers have fought and died for.

I am at a complete loss. I know what to do come the election, but I don't have any faith whatsoever that it will be a fair one. If that option is gone, what else do we have?

For starters if you are reading this comment you are most likely corona free and happy to be surviving this pandemic so far. I have personally met only one person so far among the 100s that I have talked to in the past 6 months who recovered from COVID-19. Ungrateful creatures do not need to thank Trump or anyone else. You did what you were empowered to do to stay safe by following CDC guidelines on the website CDC.gov or just continued to do whatever needed to be done to keep yourself safe. Only around 2% of the entire US population is infected. Which is 1 in 50 and 1 in 2500 has died so far in the USA and 80% were over 65 and 66% never left nursing homes or their own homes.

A national teacher's union saying that if a majority of public school teachers did not feel safe to reopen is fair enough that they might strike. I don't think any elected authority is asking anyone to go to any unsafe work place. 4 months has been plenty of time to make all work places safe even without a vaccine available for mass immunization. Safety first is great. 

Trump's call on states to reopen with more stringent safety measures is better late than never. Time to end panic and paranoia.

We need a shield and protection like never before.  The COVID Taskforce once headed by the VP Pence is nonexistent and should have been guided by BARDA.

Together come up with a strategy to get a handle on the viral spiral?   A sense of uniformity and a united front.    At least initiate factual messaging regarding the real facts of COVID prevention, cases, and priorities.

Yesterday, a  highly regarded Dr. featured on TV over the last six months = stressed how important it is for the country to take the focus off of the WH and false messaging around COVID.

Unite these Associations and initiate a united front on All Social Media and Cable news interviews and Public Service Ads

Even Dr. Birx stated that when States experience a rise in COVID Hospitalizations, it means that COVID is escalating in the communities.   Opening schools will add to even more disastrous hospitalizations.

With 21 states in the pandemic ""red"" zone, millions unemployed, on the verge of eviction, food insufficiency, vulnerable to infection and losing health coverage, what sense does it make to further cut people's fragile financial life lines, make things worse, causing people more pain and bringing us no closer to solutions while adding to chaos and recovery cost."

I am safer, where I work, not because I wear a mask, but because everyone wears a mask, and the state crushed the virus largely out of my community. I don't have the luxury of having air handling systems that filter viral particles, or the ability to work six feet away from others. I am safe ONLY because people cooperate.

And in truth, as it gets reported that numbers are falling in places with big outbreaks, I wonder: Did they? Or did the reporting just get well massaged by HHS because it is an election year, and testing and increasing infection is bad for reelection. I know that the anti-Mask league are victims of propaganda, a spreaders of it. I wonder if my own distrust is the result of propaganda, too.

However, many of our fiscal and personal beliefs connect more to the Republican platform of the past (I say past because Trump has hijacked what many of us value) than it does the Democratic platform of the future.

It does not make us bad or evil. Many of us are major financial contributors to charities. We volunteer extensively in our communities. We are not all multimillionaires. We hold college degrees. We have stable home environments. And we do care about many of the same things that those who are registered Democrats do but we may believe that the way we go about achieving those things needs to be different than the way many Democrats want to do it and to the degree that they want it done (example - most of us believe that affordable healthcare needs to be available to every person but that the option through our place of employ still needs to be possible).

Try this metaphor on for size: imagine the entire world as a class. The United States, under Donald Trump, happily put on the dunce cap and grinningly sauntered to the back of the line, proud of its ignorance and interpreting the horrified stares of the other students as proof of its ""exceptionalism.""

The president, angry that the Covid-19 forced people out of work and businesses to shutter, all but demanded that the various cautious states that imposed even modest lockdowns, reopen in time for the resurgent economy to be his last throw for a successful re-election campaign. In the late winter and early spring, George Floyd was still alive. His death had not yet complicated matters to bring to a terrible intersection social unrest, unemployment and a killing disease.

Given our strength in medicine, not to mention science and technology, our response should have been better than those of other countries, not worse. trump squandered that advantage. 

While some European countries got caught off guard they quickly reversed course to crush the curve and try to head off a second wave. trump allowed the first wave to survive and then flourish as he walked away from the podium in April (a mixed blessing to be sure since opening his mouth invariably does more harm than good).

2020-07-29 11:15:43,"“National hubris and belief in American exceptionalism have served us badly.” 

Hate to say it, but also American individualism -- as in ""Who are you to tell me what to do?""

More muscular and more successful than other children of the Enlightenment, America -- its defiance, 1776 Revolution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence -- has the fire of freedom deeply seared into its mind and psyche.

Responsibility not so much. Self-sacrifice and working for the greater good?  Less and less since the WW2 generation exited center stage.   

In the 1970's Zhou En Lai, China's second in command, was asked about the influence of the French Revolution.  ""Too soon to tell,"" he answered.

Nearly two hundred years later, and it was ""too soon to tell""?

Subsequent research has revealed that Zhou was addressing the 1968 student-led ""revolution"" in Paris, something entirely different.

However, the disparate response between the US and Asian countries makes me wonder if our inherited mantle of rugged individualism and ""give me liberty or give me death"" ethos has led to our tragically fatal handling of a pandemic.  

A large enough segment of America is feeding off a frontier spirit, whereas Asian countries are predisposed to honor the needs of the group and the elders first and foremost -- the individual secondarily.  

Who will win the long war the human race is doomed to wage against this pandemic?

America?  Maybe, but only after a major epiphany and shift in our core values."
2020-07-29 11:17:08,"Unstoppable? No, this pandemic spread is stoppable.

It requires countermeasures that too many people, including pundits and political leaders, are unwilling to take.

Many other countries have followed these countermeasures and have been successful in bringing their infection rate and open cases under control. They're gradually, carefully reopening their economy and schools.

Trump and his followers have decided to politicize this public health crisis. Failure to take effective countermeasures against the pandemic has become a loyalty test.

Their failure to act has caused additional sickness, deaths, and economic hardship in our country. It was entirely avoidable."

But the Partnership for America's Health Future, made up of industry profiteers, were strongly opposed.  So politicians, afraid of being primaried, kept our uniquely dysfunctional health system in place.

A big reason why we have done so poorly is because we can't do real time surveillance based on symptoms or diagnosis like other countries. Nor can we readily sort out who has been tested, track their results, seen what treatments may be effective, etc. because all of this is tied up in competing private insurance databases. 

And because under national health insurance, we no longer tie coverage to employment which perpetuates our racially discriminatory hiring practices, we are better able to bring patients in early rather avoid medical care, helping to show that black lives matter.

Other countries, like Canada to our north, have done far better in controlling COVID.  Their single payer system is a source of unity - and unity is what we need to beat this deadly virus."

I believe this is a big part of the reason for the uptick in the spread and for the increases in the infection rates of younger people. I say this as someone who has not politicized this virus, although I am a conservative. I have been wearing a mask since early March and I am glad that our governor has not opened bars and that our schools (in my county) will be remote during at least the first nine weeks."

It has been clear, for some time, that this illness will not be conquered in the next year irrespective of who is President and who controls Congress. The virus has qualities not encountered on this planet for over a century. Vaccines will help but are unlikely to eradicate this illness for many years. Many people are under the illusion that a vaccine will protect all who receive it 100% while yearly we know flu vaccines have 50-60% effectiveness. Masking is a no brainer and is not being utilized enough by all groups. It should be mandated everywhere but no one should believe everyone will fall in line. To fight this enemy we need unity in the nation, as after Pearl Harbor, and not petty political sniping."

A nationwide 60 day lockdown would solve the problem, but it would be politically impossible and economically disastrous. So  we need a second best plan.

This would have two components. The first would be restrictions on non-essential travel. Divide the country into areas and have people, in general, confined to these areas, which could be quite large.

The second would be to close those businesses and activities that have the potential to be superspreader events. That would include bars, large gatherings, most indoor dining, religious services, and education. These closings could be gradually lifted when the transmission rate falls below one.

Finally, we would need substantial economic compensation for those who would lose their businesses and employment, directly or indirectly, from these policies.

Unfortunately, it is clear that the earliest this could be implemented is late January 2021."

2020-07-29 11:17:17,"This article contains so many salient points to consider it is mind-boggling.   

A viral spiral.   

The fact that the FDA might accept a Vaccine that is 50% effective together with a concern about HOW effective a vaccine is among the elderly ( 60 and over?)-  doesn't that leave a very large portion of the US population who are considered High Risk vulnerable even with a vax.?

I wish someone would look into why Africa and India are not spiraling with HIGH DEATH rates due to COVID.    

Even if the death rates are under-reported in India, they certainly are not seeing a huge death rate in the most vulnerable population 80 and over.  
( I believe the estimated death rate for an individual over 80 is approx 20% in the US)  

What is the estimated death rate due to COVID for 80-year-old in India?  

 India has a TOTAL death rate due to COVID- around 35,000 for a population of 1.4 Billion----

What percentage of 35K are 80 years and older in India?

   1.4 Billion people is a huge cohort

Africa is a country to consider for more research.   The DEATH rate due to COVID is not what experts predicted or feared it would be there.

""Something"" is working in India and Africa to prevent a higher Death rate and a better recovery rate.  It might be the same thing or not.

 Waiting for Pharma to develop a vaccine is not solution for ""most of us"" in the United States, at any age.    Waiting for 100% Mask -compliance in the US is not realistic, no matter how many A-Listers endorse it."

If Dr. Fauci were running, he'd win in a landslide  -- because we think of him as the doctor who sat at our bedside when we were sick (even though he's not a physician).

Who has banished Dr. Fauci from public appearances.  And who re-tweets videos of so-called experts who believe that most medical treatments are designed to implant humans with alien DNA.  Not to mention his touting disinfectants as remedy.

If anyone thinks his mishandling of masks was bad, just wait for whatever he has to say about vaccines.  If a vaccine comes in December, as this article suggests, and he has already lost the election, you can rest assured he will call it a hoax, and people who trust him, well, enough said . . ."

Protests and fear of murder in a Walmart for a simple expectation that people don masks during a pandemic. We will all remember where American Exceptionalism drove your once mighty country.
2020-07-29 10:53:37,The problem is that there is a breakdown of the discipline to avoid this virus. People see gatherings on the beaches and public spaces where masks are not worn and social distancing doesn't exist and think if they aren't abiding by the rules why should I. I've heard others say so what if I get it I'm healthy and strong I'll get through it. When you have a president and some governors that ignore the science and refuse to mandate masks and you have a public that feel they have the freedom to do whatever they want the virus will spread unchecked. The idea that people from hot states will self quarantine is ridiculous. If they refuse to wear masks they won't quarantine themselves for 14 days and there's no way to check or enforce it. Having said that and this being the summer time the virus will spread even to the states that had it under control. It can't be said enough - when you don't have leadership and a national plan the result is chaos and an increasing national problem that can shut this country down whether Trump wants that or not.

Earlier on, I had arguments with patients about wearing masks.  We instituted a policy that no one would be seen without masks. Still, many people wer them as chin guards or leave their noses uncovered. I don’t understand how the simplest gesture of empathy for others and mutual respect has been perverted into an absurd statement of individual liberty. You demand the right to get sick or to sicken others? You feel no obligation to protect each other? Is the perception of American exceptionalism really one of unbridled selfishness? How is it that, as health care workers, we are praised as “heroes” yet insulted and assaulted by people who refuse to exercise simple decency? In the hospital, we are limping along, testing any patient who comes in. But, at what cost are we providing care? Patients are alone and often die alone. Family members are preventing from visiting for everyone’s safety.

2020-07-29 11:00:24,"""Danielle Allen, the director of Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, which has issued pandemic response plans, said that finding less than one case per 100,000 people means a community should continue testing, contact tracing and isolating cases""

What is the time period here? Daily? Weekly?"
2020-07-29 10:50:36,"The USA should look at what other countries do and learn from them:

- Test and track as much and as thoroughly as possible (as did South Korea).

-Use contact tracking apps (Germany has developed a contact tracking app which stores data only on the device for privacy reasons).

- Have clear rules everyone knows (like in Chinas, France, Italy and New Zealand).

- Adjust the rules locally depending on the situation (Germany has been great at that).

- Promote solidarity at all levels like the European Union did with covid-19-infected patients send to hospitals in states with lower infection rates. 

- Network within the WHO. 

- Choose competent and humble leaders capable of stepping down in favor of scientists (like Germany). 

Is that difficult to grasp? Does one need a doctoral degree in Epidemiology or Medicine to get it?"
2020-07-29 10:53:57,I worry most about the economic devastation.  Millions of workers will not be returning to meaningful work.  Handing out trillions of dollars will not make the virus go away.

2020-07-29 11:02:49,">>>The United States is a wounded giant, while much of Europe, which was hit first, is recovering and reopening — although not to us.<<<

If you'd looked at the current European situation you'd have
understood that the infection rate is well up. Within a similar situation as in the US - a multitude of (small) infection spots almost impossible to trace or follow. It's just that the numbers are not as high (yet).

Imho it was a wrong decision to allow free travel within the EU. As it was wrong to tolerate the congreagations of hundreds or thousands who think themselves immortal and partying their constitutional right.

I would not be surprised if many European countries will hit the break again and reestablish (and enforce) tougher restrictions.
Autumn and winter are not so far away. Neither is the flu season. There'll be less (safe) possibilities for outdoors activities. Schools are planning to open up again....

It might be no solace to you - Europe sits in the same c19 vessel as everyone else. 
But at least we try to keep the boat stable and provide people with a life jacket - universal healthcare, e.g.

Where has the 'can do' gone, your country was once admired for ?  Yeah - you cannot shoot a virus.

The answer appears near the end: ""Mr. Trump has ignored, contradicted or disparaged his scientific advisers."" Actually, it's worse. Trump pitched in the trash a pandemic playbook carefully designed during the Bush and Obama administrations, and he disbanded a group that could have led a pandemic response based on that playbook. If Trump had used the playbook's strategy, as any competent leader would have done, covid deaths in the US would have been held to the low thousands and the economy would have recovered and operating at near 100% months ago. America did so poorly because the American people put a know-nothing, incompetent, malevolent person in the White House. The cause of the failure, the blame for 150,000 covid deaths so far and probably double that by Christmas, is Trump, all Trump, and nobody but Trump."

We do not want to hear his voice tell us our children and grandchildren need to go back to school in person, in classrooms when his own son’s school will be closed.  We don’t want to hear about a medicine that is inept.  We don’t want to see that woman dressed in an array of neck scarves nodding and smiling while she stands behind Trump.

The author has done well to cite many experts, relied on many facts and figures rather than in conjecture and prejudice. What makes this article an exceptional one is that it calls a spade a spade without hype. The dangerous trend in ignoring the much needed preventive measures such as wearing masks and social distancing are well emphasised. The virus can be beaten, not by brute force or money, but by following prudent public discipline. Countries like Vietnam and New Zealand stand out as shining examples. Leaders must lead, set examples and be in the forefront of the struggle. I am sure the USA will find an answer by changing the current course of nonchalance it is presently following."
2020-07-29 11:54:38,"Here was my post of April 6th: 

""With as many as half of all those infected showing no symptoms but still able to spread the virus, is this not reason enough for all of us to wear masks? If we all wear masks, we protect ourselves and we protect others. If we are to beat this virus and resume normal life, mass testing of everyone is the key. Those individuals that test positive are quarantined for 14 days. Others are permitted to go to work and resume their daily life. Re-testing needs to be done to ensure that those that tested negative are still negative. This cycle would need to be repeated until a vaccine is identified.""

To move on to reopening your economy, you must first control the spread of the virus. Now, you need a national lockdown however unpleasant this may be.  It's life, death or as doctors have said ""patients who recover from Covid-19 frequently need to rebuild muscle strength, and some may struggle with a range of respiratory, cardiac and kidney problems or are at increased risk of blood clots and stroke. Some patients who experienced delirium while on ventilators may be at greater risk of depression.""  It's scary stuff. 

Take care everyone."
2020-07-29 11:55:04,"Thanks to the authors for this excellent summation of where we are today regarding Covid-19.  Of course, the question is ""now what?""

It appears that, at least in the United States, there is no appetite to learn lessons from the spring outbreaks.  Since those outbreaks occurred (or are occurring) ""other places,"" people feel unaffected and unafraid.  Hence, no there was national response or sense of dread as New York burned and the rest of the country watched.  Politicians, hired by the people to lead, failed to do so in a responsible way and with a public health focus.

Now many of those other places are on fire with the virus, but still no national response.  Our lack of national unity, about anything, really, will likely finish us off as a country.  We know what needs to be done to kill the virus.  But, to borrow a phrase from the play ""Hamilton,"" we seem to be eager to ""...throw away our shot!"""

Simple politics: in this election year, make it clear that you will support only those politicians who value their constituents enough to support measures necessary to bring this under control.

One of the tragedies early on was the lack of protection for health care workers. Locally there was a time where health care workers were prohibited from wearing masks unless a patient had tested positive. At the time there just were not enough masks. Now the situation is different and more appropriated PPE is required.

Masks are inexpensive in normal times. N95 masks are also inexpensive in normal times. I would prefer to see us err on the side of overprotection of health care workers. A full face respirator with N100 cartridges in place of the picture of the worker with a surgical mask and face shield.

I am only a digital expert on PPE, but the inconsistency in recommendations and practice is at best troubling."
2020-07-29 12:17:58,"You know what has made me sad and exhausted?
Being forced to consume the same monotonous diet of obvious common sense and scientific information about how we could conquer this epidemic, for the last 4 months.
It has been obvious to anyone with modest intelligence that simple public health measures would control it.  Just as other rich and poor nations have deployed.

Our failure has been a political failure pure and simple.  Any talk of vague ‘American exceptionalism’ detracts from the only message that we need to hear.  Our current administration is directly responsible for at least 100,000 unnecessary deaths in that time.

Not only that, but they could choose to get off the path to 100,000 more deaths at any time.  Because the remedy is so simple it is also a political act on the administration’s part to continue on the course that will knowingly kill so many more of our fellow citizens.

There’s probably a legal word for that political act."
2020-07-29 12:22:03,"Nice summary of the problems but perhaps understandably short on solutions. One aspect that needs to be addressed is how to educate and empower individuals, families and communities to make the best choices. I agree with the critical importance of masks as prevention. What is the best mask? In what circumstances? How to put it on? How to take it off? When to wear it? And most importantly such state of the art masks need to be made available to every person in the most convenient and comfortable way. Amazon should deliver free state of the art masks to all of its customers. That will help enormously. It’s a simple solution that only has one serious downside. Jeff Bezos will be a little less wealthy. Unfortunately, solutions that don’t include ameliorating any downside financial impact to Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, the Google brothers, and the insiders at Moderna no matter how useful may not gain traction in DC. Perhaps Bezos can be given legislated reparations at a later time for his sacrifice. And perhaps more can be done to pay Moderna’s execs even more money immediately before its vaccine very likely fails so that this strata is given assurances that even fully effective prevention will not jeopardize the mega money they think they deserve. In fact, shouldn’t Moderna’s stock holders as a class be shielded from the risk of effective public health prevention? Or else!"
2020-07-29 12:22:54,"One of the key new developments is that viral load also matters for COVID-19 infection. Any closed tight space could be a death trap.What this really means is that in addition to the recommended approaches we need to completely shut down air travel for one month (where the Ted Cruzes of this world cannot bring themselves to wear a mask), all stores must have either curbside pick up only or outside shopping. No closed windowed buses trains etc until daily rapid COVID testing. This HAS to be national and needs to be now.

And even a nationwide, very strict lockdown will ultimately turn out to be a failure if we come out of it with the idea that we can now return to ""normal."" Once cases have dropped to minimal levels across the country, the only way to maintain that is to implement - and strictly enforce - rules that will be not permanent, but with us until a truly effective vaccine or treatment is widely available: Those rules would include:

1. Masks mandatory in all indoor environments other than private residences, and any outdoor environments where you can't maintain a six foot distance. 

2. No indoor gatherings of over 10 people other than workplaces.

3. Remote work mandatory for every position that doesn't absolutely require an in-person presence. 

4. Bars closed. Full stop. There's just no way around this. The very nature and purpose of bars is to get people to engage in the very behavior we absolutely cannot afford right now.

5. Two week quarantine - monitored and enforced -  for anyone entering or re-entering the country.

A virus is more like dandelions. a dandelion seed lands in soil, then grows a bunch of new seeds. Then a wind comes and blows those seeds RANDOMLY. If the wind is weak it may land nearby, but a strong wind can bring it far away, leaving large amounts of unaffected space.
A virus is similar. Someone gets infected and the virus multiplies then leaves the body and depends on transportation to bring it around the country. Without airplanes it would have never reached the USA. Without people traveling around the country, it would never have left the first locations.

The virus is not 'splintering' which sounds like it is falling apart. The virus is spreading all over the country, because people keep refusing to wear their masks, and refusing to stay home.

The spread seems random, because it follows the vectors that WE create for it. If someone gets infected in one state, and drives to another state, it suddenly pops up, in a place where there is no virus. If the people there are not trying to deny the virus new hosts, then it spreads locally, taking advantage of RANDOM opportunities.

It is the behavior of communities that is splintering as the norm in some places is to supply the virus hosts, but the norm in other communities is to try to deny the virus hosts, to weaken its spread."

The infection is not a conjuring of the Democratic Party, it will not simply fade away miraculously, there is science behind the preventative measures and treatments (or lack thereof) that is and has been denied by those in power, and the examples set by the White House do not align with the reality of the situation. Trump’s maskless rallies were counter-productive; Trump’s refusal to wear a face mask in public set a poor example for his impressionable followers; and Trump’s ridiculous touting of meaningless treatments all have contributed mightily to the problem. His Republican loyalist governors followed his commands to deny the pandemic and open businesses prematurely, and countless deaths have ensued. The GOP is not the CDC or the NIH. In emergent medical situations such as we have now, the president and his political mob of incompetents should keep their mouths shut and allow the experts to lead.

Information from health experts evolved as more was learned about this NOVEL coronavirus, do we wish they learned things sooner? Yes, blame them? No.

2020-07-29 12:42:08,"The hippy answer is pertinent here: it's the system (stupid). The economic system is based on desire. The name of the game is to get people -- no longer citizens but consumers -- to desire your product or service. To this end advertising, marketing, PR, hype, gimmicks like ""opinion leaders"" -- everything and anything -- will be used. Desire in the body resides in sexuality, so all this consumer desire is overtly or covertly linked to that function that is, we all know, basic and universal. Thus the consumer gets well and truly hooked on purchasing; as well as getting their instinctual life confused. And the economy booms. ""What's good for General Motors..."".

Enter Coronavirus. To counter it individuals must distance, wear masks, wash their hands. Distancing means refraining from drinking with friends (a huge industry smack in the middle of the even huger entertainment, travel and hospitality businesses). People in soap operas come home and automatically open a beer.

And the American consumer has been showing that he or she is incapable of refraining from having fun, especially when aged between 20 and 35. Even at the risk of dying! Individuals have been conditioned since early childhood to have desires (built over the natural desires) for products and services. The economy depends on people consuming. Now suddenly they are told to stop. To behave in a quaint fashion, as if they were Puritans.

But that system needs to change. For the pandemic precedes ecological disaster."

Only 50% can find the State of New York on a map. 30% believe UFOs are aliens that have visited Earth. 

Mr. Trump has ignored, contradicted or disparaged his scientific advisers, repeatedly saying that the virus simply would go away, touting unproven drugs like hydroxychloroquine even after they were shown to be ineffective and sometimes dangerous, and suggesting that disinfectants or lethal ultraviolet light might be used inside the body.

Americans need to learn that wishing for things to be true or believing things because they fit their opinions doesn't change reality.  Viruses don’t care what you believe.  The only way to beat this pandemic is to act on the evidence without the context of political bias.  The truth has always mattered, but never as much as now."

This will happen again, and again, and again if we do not fix our system, remove the politicians from direct micromanagement.

Dear Conservatives, just get over it.  Like the rest of the rich countries, we must have universal healthcare with a singular coordinated public health system, connected to the WHO, and coordinated with the Department of State and diplomatic efforts in places like China and sub-Saharan African countries.  Otherwise, this first wave of COVID-19 will be just a warm up act for what is to come. 

Do you think that this virus, or other pandemics, will stop with 200,000 deaths and the destruction of our health system?  Think again.  As long as there are new humans to infect, the virus keeps going, searching for and infecting new victims.  Now we have no more than 5% of us who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

2020-07-29 12:52:43,"Very nice overall review in my opinion.

For me, the most important message is that we are suffering to a large part because of our “traditional” culture that places immediate “wants” above rationally assessed short and long term needs.

This has led many U.S.ians to vote on the basis of personality or identity (or not vote at all).  That has resulted in both frequent major reversals in government policies and a generally low level of governmental achievement.

In addition, our multicultural “Amuricanism” has been a continual driver of prejudice and hostility between differing “ethnic” groups, which has recurrently led to episodes of mass violence followed by shamed admission of the need for repair (with or without reparations) without  leading to this day to meaningful resolution.

Our national “laissez faire” (sp?) attitude has been a major factor in the chronic neglect of our public health system.  Instead of maintains an adequate store of emergency supplies, we have depended upon our “exceptionalism”  to save the day at the last minute (just-in-time management).  

Instead of requiring companies to make urgently needed materials when it  SHOULD have been apparent our stores of supplies would be inadequate, our President (a product of irresponsible voters) denied the need for a coordinated FEDERAL response.

Hopefully, this pandemic will lead our nation and society to a  more rational and humane place, at least temporarily."

Every time I read an article like this about Covid-19, I think that what we really need is a storrn and coordinated national response. Trump could effectuate this even now. He, better than a Democratic Party president, could tame the right wing ranters who boradcast inflammatory rhetoric and spread misinformation. He could also take the requisite public health measures, even possibly a nationwide lockdown of limited duration.

Our brand of market capitalism allows enormous (if sometimes useless) innovation. At the same time, these characteristics can leave us extremely divided, susceptible to self-harming hubris,  spinning our wheels, mindlessly destructive of the environment, hatefully ethnocentric, heartless, and patsies for hucksterism. In literature, a character is tragic because s/he can't escape fate. In life, in the life of nations, this needn't be so. But to escape tragedy, we need to honestly see our vulnerabilities, share a common understanding of what the real threat is, and believe in our abilities to overcome. For a country, that requires selfless, credible, smart and caring leadership. The good news is that we're set up to have the ability to choose that - another great strength.

And finally, layered above all of that, we have citizens who choose not to fight thereby making it worse for everyone else.

Are we the country of Donald Trump, whose delusional thinking and rapacious direction beckons us to death and divisiveness? Unfortunately the answer is yes. Political leadership requires neither compassion nor imagination, only the clever behavior that retains power. Our country has unspeakable wealth with numerous ways to attain it.

We should also have a federal office dedicated to watching for potential health threats throughout the world, with direct lines of communication to the President - just like the office Obama handed over to Trump but which Trump ended.  If Obama was allowed to have a third term there would likely not have been a global Covid pandemic or a ruined U.S. economy or massive death.

I hate to say it, but without a national lockdown we're just going to continue to see hot spots emerge and worse, re-emerge, until we have a unified national policy. Had we don't this back in March we'd be in a much better place by now. But we have an incompetent president and administration and so we are now left with this disaster in its wake. It is so disturbing that congress can't even decide on how help Americans that are now out of work. Hemming and hawking over an extra $300 per week for those unemployed while bailouts are given to billion dollar corporations. Meanwhile they have no problem adding over $1 billion for a new FBI building and let's not forget the $1 trillion dollar tax cut that went to the top 1 percent just a few years ago. It's disgusting."

Do we need dozens of famous figures all at once to get sick and die to get people’s attention?  Why does half the country still listen to Trump or tolerate a “leader” who has done nothing, and abandoned any responsibility for inaction resulting in thousands of deaths?  All our major institutions are failing at the very moment and for the most fundamental purpose they exist - to protect and preserve our people and society’s functioning.  But we the people, millions of individuals, have cooperated in blocking the carrying out of that purpose by clinging to selfishness, ignorance and “freedom” rather than person responsibility.

First, as a local citizen of my little community here in Oregon, trying to do the right thing by wearing a mask outside, distancing myself, staying away from crowds of any kind, washing my hands till the skin practically comes off, and hoping that at the age of 77 I can squeeze some extra years out of my time on earth. 

Second, however, in reading the papers and watching TV, I observe how abysmally incompetent American response to this pandemic has been. The medical community shows us the observable facts, and the leader of the nation absolutely denies the science and worse, essentially tells us to disregard it and believe him—that this is merely an outbreak of the flu. And a huge number of people actually believe him. 

The loss of hundreds of thousands of American lives and the getting sick of millions more are *directly* attributable to a man whose *only* concern is to be re-elected the President of the United States. That is how he will be remembered. 

And that is where we are today. God forbid anyone should surprise attack this country. We'd be arguing about it for months before doing anything about it.

The data do not lie. * weeks of hard work in New York and the east coast left that part of the country in control of the epidemic and slowly and safely reopening the economy. The northeast looks like Germany in terms of Covid. New Covid cases way down, low death rates, careful economic revival. Because we had no national policy, and remarkably incoherent national leadership, many governors disregarded the public health experts and opened the doors way before the data said it was safe to do so. The result is multiple states performing like third world developing countries with uncontrolled epidemics huge numerns of new cases and many preventable deaths. Look at the Brazil covid curves and compare them to Florida--they are very similar!
The virus does not care about politics, it is simply the math of how many people an infected person without a mask can infect. How sad that many of our leaders simply are unable to grasp what leadership in a crisis means. Unite around facts, create a plan and lead the people to a better place that may require sacrifice to get there. Instead we have obfuscation and spinning of the facts, efforts to divide and agitate the people and nurturing and modeling of selfish behavior that increases the new cases and deaths."
2020-07-29 13:58:05,"You only have to look at many other countries, like Germany, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea, to realize that the pandemic that's griping the United States was not inevitable.

Those countries had national plans that used conventional public health procedures, like test, contact tracing and wearing mask, to suppress the pandemic to a level that allowed for slow and safe reopening.  

Our problem is that Trump politicized the pandemic.  We were slow to respond because he put his priority on the stock market (which he thinks, wrongly, is the same thing as the economy).  We lost two crucial months, giving the virus a head start.  When Trump finally acknowledged the virus, his administration sent mixed messages, giving his supporters permission to ignore even the slightest inconvenience .  That made measure like mask a political statement.  He then pressured states (and now schools) to reopen too early, far before his own administrations guidelines allowed.

If Trump had been the leader of any of the countries that have had success against the pandemic, they'd be the ones in crisis and we'd be sending the aid.  Or, more likely, ""thoughts and prayers""."

All are areas that probably have old and/ or substandard air ventilation systems which may be responsible for the enhanced spread of coronavirus. I have heard others say that could not possibly happen because this is a virus and not a bacteria. Yet, to ignore such a critical common factor is just crazy. 

It would be easy and inexpensive to collect the air coming out of such systems during an outbreak and do an electron microscopy examination of the surfaces of the ventilation system. The critical finding to look for are ribosomes. Those are a primitive cellular micro-organelle that are found in human cells but predate all human cells. They are very basic and necessary to the reproduction of coronavirus. Perhaps, because of their primitive nature, they are able to survive independently in these systems. If so, they mass produces of copies of the virus which are then widely spread as soon as the ventilation system is turned on."

Two basic reasons for this (a) no free (or almost free) health care for every citizen & (b) too many people believe their rights overcome the rights of their fellow citizens. And on top of that having a govt that will not prescribe to either of the above.  The COVID numbers have been lower in countries where citizens do as they are asked.
Australia has another outbreak because of too many young people partying  as well as many well-to-do people thinking now is the time to begin dining out again and having dinner parties thus all ignoring social distancing and in the process of their selfishness a lot more people have been infected and some have died.  
It's winter here so people in the south of the country have headed north in their hundreds, most in caravans. So it's back to stronger border controls, wearing masks and being extra careful again just as we were beginning to contain it."

One with a National Plan, France, under the competent Macron, one with a State based plan, where by law the Federal government has no say,  Germany and the response was handled by the States, each having its own plan

And the comparison of the two shows that both the number of death per 100 000 (France 45.12 Germany 11.01)  and the mortality rate (France 13.9% Germany 4.4%)  is far lower under a local plan

Americans had understood that smoking was bad for health, and smoking was forbidden in all closed avenues and most open ones as well. (At that time, in Italy, smoking was still widespread and quite a nuisance to non smokers).
So why is it so difficult for many Americans to wear masks? The issue is similar: give up a bit of your freedom to protect your health, the health of your loved ones and of all community.
If a person understands why you cannot puff your smoke on other people's faces, why can't he understand the need to wear a mask?"
2020-07-29 14:31:09,"Excellent, well-researched article, Mr. McNeil. This has been a failure of our political culture, as have been most American debacles in the past couple of decades. Our federal system is well-suited to cope with these localized crises, the states acting to cope with local outbreaks, empowered by federal leadership and assistance. Of course, federal leadership has been a catastrophic failure.

I take issue with one important point, that “Unpredictable superspreading events in nursing homes, meatpacking plants, churches, prisons and bars are major drivers of the epidemic.” These events were absolutely predictable, and were predicted. Trump and his followers simply chose to ignore the forecasts by experts. Millions of infections and thousands of deaths have been the consequence."

A hard- core lockdown for 3 weeks would crush this outbreak; but is “politically impossible.”  So we’re putting the perspective of a few hundred out of touch politicians ahead of the well- being of the other 330 million of us. Pretty sad picture of our country.  I do love this country, but in this case believe we should be much better than this."

Enough about what's wrong. Here's what we need:

1) Lots and lots of public service announcements through all forms of media targeting as many users as possible with messages reinforcing mask-wearing, physical distancing, and affirming that these measures are proactive ways for people to help themselves and others.
2) Addressing head-on the ""isms"" that have been a key factor in the spread of this virus in this country, including ageism and the dismissal of risk solely based on age. We need public recognition that we don't live in demographic groups. Most of us live in multigenerational families (by birth or by choice) where everyone's life in the family system has value and purpose.
3) Creating opportunities for workers in health care, schools, factories, etc., to participate in planning and decision-making for reopening. The people who are at most risk deserve to be at the table when decisions and plans are being made.

no gatherings, no indoor dining, shopping, bars, gyms. Mandatory masking . If all of this can't be accomplished,  the death tolls, hospitalizations will rise. These mandates have to be nationwide. All the money wasted on inadequate PPE etc. from private contractors is a disgrace. Bills supposedly to help curb this pandemic should not include other items e.g F BI bldg. If all of this is done nationwide, this virus could be curbed. Income support for those who lose their job and businesses should be of concern.

Historians will eventually explain it all, but for now he is singularly responsible for a failed (nee, non-existent) national US response.

Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong, and even luck has abandoned us. Remember when the heat of the summer was supposed to suppress the virus? 

The messaging, from day one, was inconsistent and often wrong. And the lack of competent leadership has been devastating, at both the Federal and State levels. 

Testing was, and still is, abysmal, with not enough testing, long waits for those who want to be tested, often inaccurate results, and long waits for results which may be wrong. What ever happened to the $1 test take-at-home test? 

People continue to flout the rules, and this has made the crisis much more deadly than it needed to be, and crushed the economy. Ironically, opening up too soon, while providing a short-term boost, will end up costing us much more than if we were more cautious and waited longer.

The only thing we can do now is listen to the health experts, follow the rules we know so well, and hope that an effective vaccine and/or herd immunity gets us out of this mess sooner rather than later.

I'm sure this has played and continues to play a role in NYC, and the limited data I've seen on antibody testing would seem to bear this out.

We have whole states in the US where the official COVID-19 case rate is over 20,000 per million (2%) and climbing. In specific cities/counties within those states, the local case rate is often 2 or more times that. Allowing for the large number of uncounted infections (generally estimated at somewhere between 2-10 times official case numbers), the true total infection rate in many local populations could already easily exceed 10%.

So I'm becoming convinced that the only way the US has out of this (absent a vaccine) is to continue down the present foolhardy path, and infect many more people."
2020-07-29 15:18:11,"""In most states, contact tracing is now moot — there are simply too many cases to track.""

1) This is a false assumption based on assuming not enough resources. The reason Vietnam had 0 deaths is because they did 1000 tests per infection. I understand containment was easier in the beginning but the US is no Vietnam in terms of resources. 

2) In addition to testing and tracing Vietnam did an astonishing public information campaign. With Hollywood in the US we can  reach EVERYONE.  I do not want to quibble about first amendment and ""freedom"". Speech that kills is not protected. 

3) Respect for the law.  There are no bad and good laws. In Greece, one of few countries with COVID-19 deaths under 2  per 100,000 population (the US has 45.62 deaths per 100,000), when they noticed an uptick of infections, when they opened to tourism, they immediately passed a $175 fine for not wearing a mask. 

How is this different from the speeding fines? If you drive 90 miles an hour the fine is $500. Yet the odds of dying or killing others by speeding in the  2017 statistics was 30 per 100,000 for the ENTIRE YEAR. 

If we want to stop the COVID-19 killing fields we can:
1)  increase dramatically testing and tracing. Some African countries did pool blood testing for the virus. 
2) mobilize ALL tools for informing public opinion, and 
3)  back all this with stiff fines to elicit compliance. 

Vietnam profited financially from acting responsibly. It is a clear win win, less death - better economy."

One theory this might be true is that human encroachment into natural areas, continued exponential growth of the population, puts humans into contact, or exposure to, novel pathogens.

The other theory is that the humans themselves are reckless about how they study pathogens using a 'gain of function' technique to make a pathogen more virulent so it can be anticipated when it shows up 'naturally' in the human host; and then poor bio-safety protocols are followed and the bug escapes. This is what the President has suggested may have happened, and he has access to high level information. 

While a mad dash to find a cure to Covid19 is being deployed, it would be useful to scientists studying the virus for a cure to know what the Chinese and Americans scientists already know about the SARS Cov2 from studies completed from 2008 through to 2019; some of this information is military grade national security information, and we are already in a national emergency, maybe there should be more show and tell from those in the know."

In the past, when Trump spouted nonsense or created frightening policies, I always thought that history and a subsequent administration could potentially reverse the course and inform the uninformed.

She most likely would not have used the act to provide beef to Americans while workers in meat processing plants die from Covid due to unsafe conditions in those plants. 

Of course some Republicans would have fought her tooth and nail on every effort to enforce a mandatory mask wearing rule. Of course there would not have been federal forces tear gassing US citizens. 

No matter how difficult and how much she and her administration would have had to fight back and push back against the “it’s my right not to wear a mask” crowd, does anyone believe that we would have over 4.3 million cases and over 150,000 deaths under a Clinton administration?

At this point, how could anyone even consider voting for the president who brought us to this tragic place?"
2020-07-29 15:35:29,"How to count the failures? Let’s start at the very top, with a president who pitches injecting bleach (only the least medical of his miracle “cures”) and undermines his experts, not to mention stirs up anger at Democratic governors who make the difficult choices he can’t to lockdown and make masks mandatory. Then let’s move to the governors who do the absolute minimum to contain the virus, and so they don’t contain it at all, and undermine their Democratic mayors who pass mandatory mask ordinances. Then let’s talk about the tech giants like Twitter, which halfheartedly started a project of cutting down on misinformation— just politicians really, so far, leaving bots and bad actors from within and foreign to promote conspiracy theories. And Facebook, dithering and delinquent while misinformation is spread like idk the virus itself. Then there are your basic individual yahoos who, thanks to an abominable misinterpretation of civic freedoms, refuse to wear a mask at all. And now these many levels of failure are demanding we just look past it all and put kids in school and act like we’ve done the best we can and since we’re Americans it was the best job in the world. There is no limit to the denial of reality from Republicans. They must be voted out at every level."

Lincoln, a medical anthropologist and historian at San Francisco State University. “We were not prepared to see the risk of failure.” It wasn't ""we"" who served us badly. The people who ""served us badly"" have names and should be identified, again and again: Trump and his slew of sycophants; Republican Congressional leaders, governors and mayors too fearful of the Trumpeters to assert control by maintaining lockdown; social media billionaires who claimed ""objectivity"" while profiting from the distribution of misinformation and false advertising; heads of multinational businesses who grabbed the trillions of dollars meant to sustain small business during the pandemic; and on and on.

We know his sole motivation is to be reelected and the mounting number of cases and deaths poses a formidable obstacle to that goal. Trump demands instant gratification and he refuses to understand that an economic recovery cannot be accomplished before the virus is contained.

Those people who refuse to mask themselves, who demand their “rights” and their “freedom” amid this pandemic have been subjected to propaganda on AM radio and Fox, not to mention the newest websites, for 30 years to be this way.  They refuse to change their “values”.

The “values” they hold center on their individuality, their identity.  It’s personal, it’s spiritual, and it’s familial.  These are not changeable over a short period.  
This situation seems to me to be the unintended consequence of Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh, and now Mitch McConnell and others and their program of American Exceptionalism that they dreamed up to create political power.  They got illegal immigration crackdown, reduce abortion services, unfettered gun ownership, and a Judicial system packed with their ideologues.  

To watch Jim Jordan in action yesterday truly drives it all home.  He ignored everything said so he could throw in his partisan and ignorant diatribes in the People’s House.

Each time I see a TX plate in town, my thoughts are  ""go home and stay there, unless you live here now, in which case pay NM taxes and register your vehicle here.""

They were reared to deny evolution because it didn't fit their literalistic reading of their holy book. They isolated themselves to media outlets that serve as propaganda outlets for the fossil fuel industry and, so, reject anthropogenic climate change. They get their economic philosophy from the same progagandist and reject the irrefutable data that since the end of World War II, the economy has grown faster, produced more jobs, and seen large stock market gains under Democratic administrations than under Republican ones. They reject the overwhelming evidence that slavery, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration are the direct results of systemic racism that persists to this day. They are the people who insist on homeschooling their children because they fear they will come to believe in reality rather than the denialism, the willful ignorance which they have refused to abandon all their lives.

A substantial number feel the need to point out ""we blew it"" and point fingers of blame. But given the overwhelming and confusing data (itself disputed) it appears that our herd immunity goal, reached by a combination of acquired immunity and a vaccine, will suffer substantially the same number of infections as early prevention measures would have allowed. I know my COMMENT herein may anger some, but estimating the number of possible preventions is pure speculation - and does not eliminate the possibility that such ""preventions"" will not contract Covid-19 later this year."

They denied the virus, they downplayed it’s seriousness, they blocked effective action, they abandoned a coherent national strategy to avoid responsibility, they fostered a fragmented localized strategy that pits blue cities against red state governments, they have concealed vital data, and they have spread CT instead of solid science.

""A Stitch in Time Saves Nine"" May seem redundant, but only a handful of leaders seem to get it.  Efforts to stop this virus have been disjointed, delayed and reactive.  When the curve starts going up it's already too late. The time to act is when the curve starts to flatten....that's when we double down (not open up) and continue to double down for at least another six weeks. 

Protecting our borders:
I live in the Poconos mountains, primarily a tourist destination.  Back in March, NYC became a Covid hot spot in less than three weeks. People were coming from NYC for the day or the weekend, spreading virus indoors in restaurants, pubs, supermarkets etc. Tourists from other (Covid free) states visited the Poconos during that time, likely taking the virus back with them. 
In good faith, our  governor gave a stay at home order and Monroe residents complied. In the meantime, visitors from NYC and other places, continued to use our business, hotels etc. A few days after that, Monroe county, PA closed all but essential businesses....by then however, Monroe was one of the most darkly shaded area on the PA map. 

Restricting cross border traffic and preventing cross state contamination can also save lives!"

This epidemic isn't the only entity that is ""splintering  into deadly pieces.  I know so many people who's lives continue to splinter into many, many pieces not just from the death of a family member or friend, but also because they lost their job, they are behind in their rent and/or mortgage payments, don't have enough money for food and have late payment notices for water and electricity.  To say their lives are ""overwhelming"" is a major understatement.

Every time I hear Trump say something utterly ridiculous or a complete fantasy like ""much of the country is ""corona free"" or his push for hydroxychloroquine is proven to be effective, I become enraged because I keep thinking about the friends of mine who are barely hanging on to their own reality which is scarier than any Stephen King or Dean Koontz novel I've ever read.

2020-07-29 14:53:35,"Donald J. Trump is in my estimation the most dangerous president in the history of the United States. What made America great centuries before he became president was the principal of separation of church and state enshrined in the first amendment. Tony Perkins of Family Research Council called Trump up back in March because Perkins wanted a national day of prayer so immediately the following Sunday Trump proclaimed a day of prayer. Then on June 1 he was asked, not sure by whom to stand in front of a church holding up a Bible. This is the church dictating to the state."

As soon as my family learned of the disease, we got prepared. My wife is a retired nurse and she was placed as the head of family research. She focused on all of the available information and organized the methods all of us would use.

What we did wasn't rocket science and many other families acted similarly. The huge void in preparedness belongs to one man, Donald Trump, and the ignorant governors who followed him.  Whereas NY Gov Cuomo prepared his state and helped thousands to survive, the Govs of AZ, TX, FL, GA and others listened to Trump and did little to prepare. Trump's actions were counter productive, he did less than nothing. He cut the Pandemic Response Team at the time of a pandemic and failed to use the Defense Production Act to build the PPE the nation needed. 

Despite all of his failures and terrible advice, he remains in charge and continues to spew nonsense, promote false cures, and create mayhem. Face facts, this is not an R vs D thing. If Nixon were president, we wouldn't be here. Ditto for Reagan, Ford, or either Bush. Those republicans knew that nation came first.

Investigators, writers, men and women of sciences: social, political and medical will plumb the depths of this current disaster. Experts today will calculate and explain what we can do to change the course of this pandemic but it will take almost all of us to co-operate.

We have too many people who are more concerned about themselves than anyone else, while at the same time, paradoxically, wrapping themselves in the mantle of patriotism so they can pontificate about their freedom to basically let the invader win by refusing to mask up. We have too many people who have never traveled and believe that America is the, strongest, smartest, _____est nation the earth has ever seen and will surely defeat the virus faster than any of those $hithole countries could dream of doing.

  Meantime, Trump is whining about Fauci's popularity even as his own ineptitude,obstruction, and obfuscation is prolonging and exacerbating America's infection rate and bringing America to its financial knees. How can his supporters overlook his egregious mishandling of this crisis?"
2020-07-29 13:33:35,"We’re in terrible shape because we have terrible leadership. Plain and simple.

2020-07-29 13:37:20,"In many of the essentials absolutely required to curtail this pandemic without American society falling into a chaos most of us can hardly imagine, our nation gets an F.

Universal health care, a safety net for the tens of millions whose incomes will wiped out, support for small businesses, dependable food supply chains, a Congress (Senate) committed to the public good -- we are woefully deficient in all these areas.

Two chilling interviews in a podcast from The Intercept give a stark assessment of just bad it is and probably will be: 

<a href=""https://theintercept.com/2020/07/22/weak-state-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-exposed-americas-dysfunctional-democracy"" target=""_blank"">https://theintercept.com/2020/07/22/weak-state-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-exposed-americas-dysfunctional-democracy</a>/

I don't believe those of us with comfortable middle-class lives that are stable, despite the challenges of Covid-19, want to actually consider that the continued spread of this horrific disease could render areas of the United States almost unlivable.

However I think we must be willing to look into the abyss to prepare ourselves for what will come. After listening to this podcast I have begun making plans for life in a broken and chaotic America. At this point in the pandemic we all need to begin to plan for the unthinkable.

It can happen here. It is happening here right now."
2020-07-29 14:02:37,"Darkness and doom. “Resistance is [or seems] futile.”   So far, however, we have been spared the worse here in Rhode Island and throughout New England. Why? Because of good old Yankee common sense and not the Trump and conspiracy nonsense. When you’re sick never seek advice from a politician, but from your doctor. That’s what are political leaders here have done. They’ve listened to good Dr. Fauci and their own public health physicians and followed their recommendations. “Test, test, test!” Mandatory lockdowns until the curve of the outbreak was flattened and even “crushed.” Mandatory wearing of masks and social distancing. Followed by carefully monitored step-by-step, phase-by-phase reopening. Et voila! The doctors’ advice has worked. But, that takes more patience than Donald Trump and his willing band of enablers would tolerate. And now all they have to show for it is real patients— over 4 million of them, and 150,000 fatalities and an economy on life support."
2020-07-29 15:09:00,"The only American exceptionalism is our ignorance. We are not greatest, the bravest, or even the richest. Every American, media agency, and governor should be demanding that trump immediately resign. He just does not care one iota that Americans are dying and lives are being ruined. He’s been golfing at least a dozen times since the pandemic started. That’s completely unacceptable. Until he’s out the virus wins."

    Unfortunately for many Americans, this is a constitutional issue, that is unbelievable. Our Vice president who is also the chairman of the white House Coronvirus Task Force said recently: "" Even in a health crisis, the American people don’t forfeit our constitutional rights""  
     How is wearing a mask unconstitutional?  This is nonsense. Then wearing a car seatbelt is also unconstitutional.
    We are in an extraordinary time, the biggest public health crisis of this century. Being required to wear a mask is not a violation of a person's civil or constitutional rights as long as everyone has to do the same. For those who don't want to wear a mask, it is not their constitutional right to infect other people.
   Wearing a facemask is a simple thing, can save millions of people, I am simply amazed to see that out of 19 states that have yet to issue a mask mandate 18 are run by Republican governors. what are they waiting for? ignorance and stupidity kills lot of people."

I don’t necessarily mean that he is conscious of being one (although I wouldn’t rule that out!). I mean he is so inept and so divisive that he is doing great damage to this country. Permanent damage. Putin was well aware of his flaws when he went all in on his behalf in 2016. All is going to plan and the Coronavirus is icing on the cake.

If we failed this reality check this bad over a single virus, we are doomed when it comes to the soon to happen worst effects of Global Warming.

Over 30% of Americans still think Global Warming is a hoax.   And a president and his enablers continually reduce funding to come up with solutions to it and they do the opposite of educating us to get us to act responsibly.    Global Warming is gonna make SARS CoV2 look like a crazy little birthday party as it unleashes the true horror of its positive feedback loops on the world."

Combine that with the fact that there was NO Federal response at all when it was needed the most, and here we are. It's interesting how the Trump Administration and the Republicans were perfectly fine with letting a lot of people die in New York and New Jersey in March, but once it hit the South, oh well, now it's a different story and we need to do something. 

This country is a full on dystopian nightmare now, with an opposition party that can't do anything to stop the absolute havoc that the Republicans are inflicting on what's left of this place."

Again and again he has failed miserably in keeping the health and safety for the people of this country as a priority.  He has made the crisis a political issue that is all about him and his reelection.

Anyway, I agree with others we need a national shut down for at least 30 days. Congress needs to pass that bill ASAP so people can indeed sit home and collect $ and wait out the storm. 

Once the virus is contained in small pockets, we can then resume opening up with tracking/testing and mask wearing!"
2020-07-29 16:41:23,"Lack of preparation and leadership means that we are all on our own.  Across from my dwelling there is a day care center.  I don't see what goes on inside but when they take the kids to the playground not even the staff wear masks. nearly all parents dropping their kids off don't wear masks.  Two weeks ago the governor's task force, realizing that day care centers can be vectors for community spread advised that day care centers adhere to mask wearing and other precautions.  I called to health department and they were unaware of the task force directives and said nothing can be done.  At a local US Post Office, many employees refuse to wear masks saying they work for Trump and don't have to obey state directives.  Little league baseball teams are playing without any precautions.  Everyday I see many examples of non-compliance.  It seems it's only a matter of time till they virus spreads again.  A dire situation."

2020-07-29 14:42:51,"Back on 9 Nov 2016, many NY Times readers (myself included) dreaded what was to come.  We feared an autocratic turn; a rise in racism against blacks and Latino immigrants; a rollback of the hard earned social programs, Obamacare, and we feared some unknown calamity that would be completely mismanaged, or worse, initiated or acerbated by a man with no moral compass, no ethical boundaries and no concern for any one other than himself.

Well, here we are.  After calling Nazi's and white supremacists ""good people,"" giving a huge tax break to the top 1% in America, attacking the ACA in a politically corrupted Supreme Court and now using the DHS as his own paramilitary force to ""quell"" Americans' most basic rights of free speech and  peaceful protest, the calamity has struck.  

Today we will exceed 150,000 American lives lost from the Coronavirus.  Thousands of lives that could have been saved had this single person followed his scientific advisers counsel. Instead, he corrupted them (all but Anthony Fauci). He attacked the single greatest line of defense we had - a temporary shelter-in-place that would have significantly reduced the curve to a manageable infection/tracking rate; refused to provide Federal resources to help States and counties test and track the disease; and, incited anti-democratic actions like the armed takeover of the MI state capital. And today, he and his party play Russian Roulette w/our economy. 

Our worst fears have come true.

And, by the way, most scientists agree that a vaccine is expected this winter (although probably not December) and should work against all the COVID-19 strains (or splinters) because it attacks the “crown” portion which is common to all strains.

Hospitalizations are down at about the same amount also.  As much as the alarmists want to say the epidemic is getting worse, the facts don't support it.  They only want to talk about ""new"" cases which are mostly not new.  Anyone tested positive will get re-tested to see if they are still infected.  Each re-test is counted as a ""new"" case.

My wife and I couldn't visit her other than to waive to her from the parking lot as she stood on her balcony. But I spoke with her three times daily, and she has always been a very positive person. She didn't think for one second that the precautionary measures were a hardship or imposition on her. She was a young adult during WWII and saw her brother ""sacrifice"" two years of his young life in the army, fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. She met my dad after he served two years in the navy. She readily understood the sacrifices millions upon millions of Americans made during that awful time coming on the heels of the Great Depression. She wore the same clothes day after day...consumer goods were scarce. 

Her community came through the worst of the pandemic and reopened for outdoor visits in early June. She was thrilled to visit with me and my wife. She can't understand how our country has fallen into so much disorder, when the simple act of wearing a mask has become a horrific cultural issue. Her brother was ""destroyed"" in Europe fighting for his country. College age kids her can't wear a mask or avoid bars or large parties? What have we become?"

We can’t sit on our hands through next spring awaiting a new President Biden and the three or four months it will take him to change the direction of US coronavirus response. We’ll all have been infected by then if we do. We’re stuck with the leaders we have, the state or local policies lower-level governments are willing to adopt, and whatever countermeasures businesses offer to help customers and employees cope, few of which look promising to me.

The only way to avoid total population exposure is to band together as a people, by neighborhood, by school, by workplace, family or social circle and, consulting the best information on risk reduction we can find, go about the project ourselves. Making our own choices separately according to prior belief leaves each fate up to luck with odds against. Good thing most survive, but who wants to chance the unknowns of a zoonotic virus no matter how young?

Improving our aggregate outcome is still possible: Mask up, wash hands, seek distance, minimize time spent on engagements we must undertake and eliminate those we can forego.

Since the warm weather has begun, and even though large gatherings have been outdoors, they were irresponsible, no social distancing and no masks.  Sadly also, ""kids being kids,"" our young adults have thought themselves to be invincible enough not to become infected with Covid-19.  But a dominant factor in spread has to do with our socio-economic paradigm.  Too often, multiple generations of families are forced to live in one home and simultaneously are required to work out of  their homes by their employers.  They are between a rock and a hard place. 

Our counties in the Bay Area are now finding that it is necessary to fine those who reject state and county guidelines.  One, of course, is wearing masks.  Some people think this is harsh.  But not I.  Maybe now people will learn to be responsible."

2020-07-29 18:14:22,"Contact tracing, the bread and butter of infectious disease handling, is never ""moot."" To claim this is actively misleading. In regions of this country where we say containment efforts are overwhelmed by an outbreak of the virus, we should also say that contact tracing is underfunded and under-resourced relative to the scope of the outbreak-- in addition to being ill-tolerated by the general public. Mitigation efforts, like so-called lockdown measures, are not something to be instituted when containment efforts fail; they are, and should continue to be communicated as, measures implemented in order to reduce transmission to levels within the capacity of local contact tracing, contact quarantine, case isolation, and case treatment operations. Hospital capacity is thus only one indicator of containment capacity.
False dichotomies abound when it comes to the public health responses to COVID-19, but the one between mitigation and containment has been there from the start. WHO rationalized its refusal to call the outbreak a pandemic even after declaring PHEIC by claiming it did not want to cause nations to believe domestic community spread was inevitable and throw in the towel on containment efforts at a time when it was urging all nations, regardless of case numbers, to surge such capacities (especially at POE). It failed then, as we fail now, to account for nuance in the mismatch between local containment capacities and local transmission and case importation."

Their clinical experience has moved them to counter misinformation. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, acting like medical authorities, but really just opposed to the differing scientific opinion of the Frontline Doctors, took down the video. In it, the doctors point out that editors of “Lancet,” who do have scientific credentials, had pulled two anti-hydroxychloroquine papers two weeks after they were published. This almost never happens in studies of that magnitude. Why? Because they were based on garbage data. But the major media didn’t report “Lancet’s” action. Perhaps reporting it would undermine their political agenda, since President Trump is a hydroxychloroquine booster. Why is an obviously promising therapeutic being politicized? Maybe reps from those social media giants will be forced to answer that question on Capitol Hill today."

Not guaranteeing people a livable income while asking them to engage in this communal sacrifice was, again imo, where it all went wrong.

2020-07-29 13:25:16,"Why is the FDA blocking the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when risk of adverse reaction and death extremely low?

It certainly appears that its use is wide spread around the World and it is saving lives as evidenced by the lower death rate from Covid-19 
in countries that use hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) vs countries like the USA that do not allow it. 

The Association of American Physicians & Surgeons (AAPS) indicates it would save lives.
<a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-evidence-presented-for-why-hydroxychloroquine-should-be-made-available-in-a-new-court-filing-by-the-association-of-american-physicians--surgeons-aaps-301098030.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-evidence-presented-for-why-hydroxychloroquine-should-be-made-available-in-a-new-court-filing-by-the-association-of-american-physicians--surgeons-aaps-301098030.html</a>

I think the FDA should stop blocking its use and leave its use up to the people who want to use it and their physicians.
""The mortality rate from COVID-19 in countries that allow access to HCQ is only one-tenth the mortality rate in countries where there is interference with this medication, such as the United States,"" explains Andrew Schlafly who is an American lawyer and Christian conservative activist.
Polish chemists have even showed the world how to synthesize HCQ from cheaply, widely available ingredients. The cost of this medication is less than a dollar a dose, in contrast with the very expensive alternatives being pushed by FDA officials.
In its filing, the FDA insisted that the public has no right to access nearly 100 million doses of HCQ which were donated to the Strategic National Stockpile."

And they are baffled that masks have become a political issue in the US.

Most of the blame for this is on Trump, of course. But as much as I despise him, I also find myself increasingly disgusted with the ignorance and selfishness of my fellow citizens. 

A colleague of mine - someone who I previously thought was smart & reasonable - just posted the ""conspiracy"" about the doctors pushing Trump's favorite drug, warning that the ""deep state"" is trying to keep life-saving medicine out of our hands.

She may not have made it to the Oval, but that was the true sentiment of the American people. 

If we vote in November 2020, we can decisively throw out those who have destroyed us. By January we may have a death toll of 500,000 with untold millions of cases, a decimated economy, social unrest not just in cities “controlled by Democrats”, and a justice system that rewards Trump’s friends and punishes his enemies. Biden will have a lot of work to do, but he will choose good people to undo the harm done to us. It reminds me of the time in January 2009 when Obama took office and the economy was destroyed (again, under a Republican regime), and he said it would take time for us to get back on our feet.

It humorous to read the revelation in today’s news that mask wearers can actually protect themselves in addition to others.  Don’t mean to be flippant, but I’ve been wearing industrial grade N95’s in public since mid March.

As a NY'er who saw the early ravages of this disease, I've been generally pleased with how the State and its various ""regions"" has thus far responded.  We've moved from what was once a total lockdown to phased re-openings throughout the State.

And while we've seen some ""backsliding"" at places such as bars and other congregate venues and activities -- we've by and large kept our ""numbers"" in terms of infections down.

But, quite frankly, I am now fearful that we are once again at the calm before the next storm -- the onset of the dreaded ""second wave"".

Whether it's by easing our own safe practices or due to an influx of ""spreaders"" from other areas I do think we are likely on the cusp of another horrific outbreak.

One hopes that the Governor will use his powers to turn down the ""re-opening valves"" (his terminology and graphic) if, or more likely when, the outbreak reasserts itself.

But I also fear that as a society we will find it much harder to embrace the necessary restrictions and closures in the same way we did earlier.

In the end, like others who understand the risks etc., I can only hope that one day soon there will be a truly effective vaccine (and perhaps even a ""cure"") that can lift this scourge and let us truly resume more normal lives."

2020-07-29 20:53:21,"Given that the vaccine efficacy goal is merely 50%, the government has to start investing as much money in viable treatments as it is in vaccines. 

As the article makes clear, in severe cases of the virus dexamethasone and remdesivir are insufficient to combat the virus without the aid of other effective tools.

As experience has shown us, the elderly and people with immune-compromising diseases are more likely to develop severe cases of the virus and to die from it. Those groups are also more likely to experience deficient immune responses to many, if not most, vaccines. Without a range of effective available treatments, the virus will continue to pose a deadly threat to them. 

Given that Boomers spend the most money in our economy, it certainly would behoove this economy-obsessed administration to start spending as much on treatment research as it is on the development of vaccines.

Going to the volunteer website is more discouraging when three of the four people they chose for the promo photo are at a higher COVID risk than the average person (restaurant industry, meat processing, elderly and black, unable to work from home) Clearly the site was designed with the idea that showing diversity would enable their effectiveness, but what I see at the moment is, “Please - low income, at risk, non-white people of this country, give us your time and and try out this vaccine that may work and if so, make us an enormous amount of money.

I don't even think he necessarily meant it malicious or mean-spirited whatsoever. He just doesn't GET it. He didn't respond with any solemn gravitas to display he grasps how severe it is for people who did NOT marry the heiress to a vast fortune.

Even economists from the IRS have stated how it's nonsense that the unemployment bonus is discouraging people from going back to their jobs. GOP- I HAVE NO JOB TO GO BACK TO. My career as a Hotel Supervisor has been halted for FOUR MONTHS NOW. Yes, I'd make slightly less to go back to work- but GIVE ME MY JOB ANY DAY. However, due to the Trump Administration's mishandling of this pandemic, JOBS ARE STILL SHUT DOWN. It is LITERALLY the GOP's FAULT the economy is like this.

But on the subject of today's Republican proposals to support workers and businesses, it must be blocked to get something legitimate. The liability reform must be defeated. It's a sinister attempt by business and government to avoid the obvious prosecutions they deserve for the incompetence or malice that resulted in mass death. For that alone, it must be stopped and those who killed indirectly must be prosecuted.

So what you're saying is if the Federal Government did this back in February when Trump was calling this the ""kung flu"" and a ""Dem panic"" we would have this crucial expanded testing capacity by now - when we really need it.

If people think this pandemic would be just as bad under Biden, you have to look at all the decisions not made, as well as the decisions made by this administration.

Their failure to plan for the worst (and instead hope it goes away with heat, or will magically disappear in April) is why we are still in this mess.

Now it's time for them to earn it. The problem isn't that workers don't want to work because of the supplemental money, it's because businesses took the money and ran.

That in result forced cancellation of their home opener in Miami tonight.

Why hasn't the president been challenged on this hypocrisy? What's good for the goose.... Trying to square the circle of Mr. Trump's often bizarre reasoning is nearly impossible.

Cities, states, sports leagues, industries, businesses, schools, governments, and countries that let down their guard down have been ripe for infection and remain so. Every infection risks serious health consequences, of which death is the worst but by no means the only threat. Deaths are terribly unfortunate and tremendously expensive after a month in an ICU. But many of the survivors of serious illness will probably suffer more, suffer for much longer, and cost even more. And we’re choosing to double or triple or quadruple the numbers afflicted for political reasons?

So now Mitch and his buddies are willing to force people back into the teeth of the pandemic or make them face financial ruin if they want to preserve their health or the health of their families.

I never understood why these people always wait until the 11th hour before coming to some kind of understanding or agreement.

As for the Republican mantra that some people are staying home and not going back to work because the $600 is more than they earn, I have two observations: (1) doesn’t that tell them that the minimum wage is too low and many Americans aren’t making a living wage, and (2) many are afraid to go back to a job that could disappear in weeks due to economic uncertainty or new stay at home orders; in such an event, they will have worked too few weeks before being laid off again to restart the clock on their unemployment benefit eligibility and would be left with absolutely no money.

Birx is now urging things be closed. Hello, welcome to reality, Birx. Until now, you were completely enabling Trump with your rosy and dreamily wrong forecasts showing the virus was just going to magically diminish.

O'Brien has tested positive. And, the Trump administration claims he's suffering only mild symptoms. But, as we all know, Trump and his administration lie about absolutely everything. If O'Brien were on death's door, they'd still say he was suffering mild symptoms. Come on, NYT, if you haven't independently verified what they've said, then you shouldn't report what they've said.

Moderna is one of several compaines receiving billions to help fund their vaccine development work. Yet, you can rest assured that if Moderna does successfully develop a vaccine, they're going to charge an exhorbitant amount for it. Thanks, Trump, for further enriching your ilk, at the expense of average Americans.

Republicans in the Senate have had zero sense of urgency on continuing emergency relief. They certainly knew when the first round of relief was going to end. What have they been waiting for? Oh, yeah, right, they couldn't care less about the fate of average Americans.

And, that's just a fraction of the US federal government's pandemic-related dysfunction from just this morning, brought to you courtesy of Trump and Senate Republicans.

We cannot wait until January 20th."

2020-07-27 10:37:36,"I have been critical of Dr. Birx as have many others on these and other forums for her, IMO,  lack of sufficient backbone in disagreeing with Trump.  I’m under no illusion that any of us have affected her to change her stance.  It’s more than likely that her medical equals in the background got to her.  Good, I say better late than never, but how many have been affected between now and back when.  

And I’m tired of hearing from a Trump, et. al., repeating the stopping of the Chinese as the be all, end all for his taking charge.  That’s like taking your baby’s temperature on Monday and getting back to check how the baby is doing the next Monday.  Enough already."
2020-07-27 11:41:36,I’m still getting over the fact that states with exponentially escalating virus numbers have had indoor bars open all this time... I am so grateful to live in a state and a region that has made decisions by following actual data and science — but it does more and more seem that we are not all living in the same country. (On that note we’ll follow Dr. Fauci ... )
2020-07-27 12:52:22,"Precious little information about the vaccine trials in this article.  How many of the people they hope to enroll are older than 60?  How many are children of varying age groups?  How man have pre-existing conditions?  Where on Earth would they find people in these categories willing to risk their lives ""for profit?""  

And BTW, how much of a profit are we talking about?  Will Medicare pay for these vaccines or will it be like the shingles vaccine--too expensive for those who rely on their Social Security checks to live, yet not covered by Medicare, even though we know it is most effective at preventing Shingles?

This country is so messed up, I can't even begin to fathom how we ever turn it around."
2020-07-27 12:08:46,"Congress and the White House need to stop playing politics with Americans' lives.  

When that extra $600 is pulled out from weekly checks at the end of the month, we're going to see widespread hunger, homelessness, and the prospect of a real depression.  Ivanka's ""Find something new"" is not going to do it, I'm afraid.

It's time Trump and McConnell stop threatening to destroy America's economy.  If they cannot help Americans workers -- regular employees and self-employed alike -- weather this storm, they need to find something new, before they bring the entire country to its knees."
2020-07-27 14:03:13,"Moderna says that it will not provide the vaccine at cost, but sell it to make a profit. Jonas Salk never tries to make a dime from the polio vaccine. He said it belonged to “the people” because March of Dimes donations had helped pay for its development. Moderna’s success, if achieved, will be due in large part to American taxpayers. How times have sadly changed. We need more Salks and fewer vulture capitalists."
2020-07-27 16:52:48,Why would anyone pay someone more to be unemployed than employed? Make the unemployment supplement a larger percent of pre virus income. The object of unemployment insurance is a safety net not a ladder that leads nowhere.
2020-07-27 17:08:55,"Unfortunately, the people who received the additional $600 did not create a PAC and turn around and ""contribute"" part of the $600 back to Congress. otherwise the next round of stimulus would be $800.

Someone was asleep at the switch :-)"
2020-07-27 17:17:44,"I’m in favor of a robust safety net, especially unemployment insurance that workers help pay for. Use of that net, however, should be predicated upon actually needing it. Politicians can squabble over the dollar figure provided, but a significant problem with unemployment insurance is efficiency. Unemployment agencies cannot keep up with the volume of claims, and cannot even begin to rigorously verify if a person could reasonably be working. It would be nice to see investment in those agencies instead of spending years making them operate so poorly they cannot meaningfully provide assistance, just so a governor can boast about low unemployment rolls (looking at you, Florida)."
2020-07-27 17:21:07,There's a lot of people on social security who already live at and below the poverty threshold who never saw the first round of $1200 because of the way it was paid out.  Will there actually be any relief.. ie the stimulus going through  the normal route through  which the normal SS payments are actually made?

You cannot solve the economic predicament we're in until AFTER you solve the pandemic predicament we're in.

We cannot let up on economic stimulus.  

Cutting the unemployment supplement from $600 to $200 is cruel.  You think people will go back to work if you cut their benefits?  Go back to jobs that don't exist because of the pandemic?

Once again, the pandemic is getting worse, not better.

We have to get rid of Trump and his enablers up and down the ticket.

It's the only way."
2020-07-27 17:26:26,Republicans has no empathy.  They are following the lead of Marie Antoinette who told the starving people of Paris to eat cake when they were begging for bread.  Ask Mitch McConnell and the other Republicans in the Senate to live on $200 a week.
2020-07-27 17:02:32,"Well.

Maybe the savings from cutting the $600 could be shoveled upwards to the donor class.

Right, Republicans?"
2020-07-27 17:01:34,"The Republican argument that people don't want to work because of the 600 dollars is a deceptive diversionary lie meant to throw you off the trail of the great Republican heist of American wealth. Workers know the unemployment benefits will end and they know that if businesses hire again, they will work, but business is not hiring after being given massive loans with the implied expectation they would rehire workers. Now the Republican corrupt practices of giving away money to their benefactors is exposed and they are trying to hide it by blaming workers. Everyone is being lied to by Congressional Republicans."
2020-07-27 17:03:04,"On it's most basic level - the Republican leadership does not care about individual Americans and families. 
This is an extreme crisis. 
Instead of looking at how to help people thrive, they are thinking that mere survival is sufficient. Life is short and they condemn benefits to our citizens including healthcare, clean water and air,  and in this case emergency assistance. It is not humane. 
Please, vote them out!￼￼"
2020-07-27 17:03:50,"The Republican rationale for the benefit cuts is that it will force workers back to their jobs instead of staying home. Jack Bergman, our notorious representative up here in Northern Michigan, has been prattling on about how unemployment benefits are paying more than the actual job thus disincentivizing  a return by workers. Perhaps if he supported paying a fair wage to these folks instead of protecting his corporate masters, workers might feel better about risking their lives to return  to those jobs. Of course the local Sinclair owned stations having been giving him unfettered access with no opposing rebuttal, thus portraying workers as selfish, unpatriotic misanthropes. Sadly, the overwhelming portion of the electorate will bye his lies and further disenfranchise themselves."
2020-07-27 16:59:34,"So the republicans want to force people to go to work amid the pandemic while indemnifying businesses for the sickness and death their employees and their families and friends might suffer. And we know that without the threat of lawsuits, businesses will do the minimum necessary, or less, to reopen. The same with forcing schools to open without adequate precautions in place. Economics over health. I  reminded of a editorial cartoon published in the Times a few months ago: “A Corpse is not a Consumer.”

How anyone can vote republican and look in the mirror afterwards is beyond my understanding."
2020-07-27 17:08:42,"The Republican Senators’ salary is about $3,269/wk (with free health insurance). But they think $600 for struggling families is “too much”. People have no jobs, cannot pay rent or buy food, and face eviction during a pandemic. Yet they are fine with a two-trillion dollar tax break for the rich. Vote them all out in November."
2020-07-27 16:55:32,$2500 a month in addition to the thousands of extra income from state and federal unemployment is absurd. You shouldn’t be making significantly more than you would working a minimum wage job.
2020-07-27 16:44:05,"If you read the news from Germany, AU, UK, Hong Kong and others countries, you would quickly realize that every day Trump remains in office is another blow to American prosperity and leadership. We are openly scorned and alliances are forming around us to displace the US dollar as the global ""reserve currency"". While the issue of ""reserve currency"" may seem foreign to many people, the loss of that status would send the dollar into free fall and result in a level of inflation never before experienced in America. The cheap toasters and tvs we enjoy would suddenly hit the pocketbook hard. So would fuel and every raw material produced offshore.

IMHO, republicans should join Dems and impeach Trump immediately. He's failed at COVID, foments hatred leading to mayhem, and he's crippling our economy. It's hard to believe that his failures are not intentional but whatever the reason, we must not allow it to continue. Impeachment and the 25th amendment allow course correction and I suggest we use those tools to avoid hitting the proverbial iceberg we are careening towards."
2020-07-27 17:14:01,"The political benefit of the $3 trillion package passed by Nancy and the democratic majority two month ago would actually go to Trump and the GOP senators up for reelection.  But Nancy put country over party and tried to save our economy.  

Now GOP senators not up for re-election are blocking any effective economic rescue plan.  Suddenly they grew a spine and are ready to sacrifice Trump on the alter of some kind of principle.    They must somehow think that with a democratic President, senate and house, they would still be able to block everything via the filibuster.  Do they really think the democrats would retain the filibuster if they win the senate majority?"
2020-07-27 17:23:46,"It's time for the Democrats to double down on the extra unemployment relief: $1200 a week.  And it goes up another $100 for every day that Moscow Mitch refuses to come to the table. 

MAGA indeed."
2020-07-27 17:23:21,"On thinking of the near election, remember how Congressional Republicans led by the Trump ""Wall"" administration focused on enriching the few wealthy at the expense of hundreds of millions of Americans. If you really think Republicans support you, ask why they have tried to destroy health care, and sought to deny you care insurance for so long and so many times. Unless your in the seven figure category, they don't care because you don't pay for their campaign. Only rich people support Republicans. All others who support them were duped by TV. Republicans actually convinced you to vote for them to take away your health care. That they don't care now should assure you I'm right."
2020-07-27 16:49:05,The event that will really help America fight the virus is the day the president tests positive and gets seriously ill. The Pied Piper of the White House will get his supporters attention and maybe they will believe this virus is for real.

Considering the billions that went to millionaire corporations, politicians, racist non-profits, racist religious shell corporations, gun shops, etc. on the day John Lewis' life is celebrated and honored by the rest of us, they are showing their true disgusting, sickening true color racist identities.

I heard on NPR that the White House reassured us that President Trump and Vice President Pence were in no danger from exposure to him. Covid-19 usually has a long period (three weeks is not uncommon) when the person has no symptoms but can spread the germs. So it has been weeks, minimum, since Trump or Pence spent time with the National Security Advisor? Is this supposed to reassure us? Holy daily briefings, Batman!"

Go look it up on the BLS. There was a net 1% wage rise in 2018, and in 2019 there were no wage gains, in 2020, we are in recession.

2020-07-27 17:58:03,"Does the GOP realize what a bad argument they have? The aid package, which pays a livable wage to unemployed workers, is preferable to working the low wage jobs available in the US. Their solution is to cut the benefit so that workers go back to their impoverished lives if the previous job even exists. 

I think that the party fails to understand that the ideological foundations of their beliefs are crumbling. Coming to the end of a long-term debt cycle, an entirely new economic paradigm will have to be created as it was after WWII.

If they want to save money but also be equitable, a better plan could be to set it according to the person’s previous salary, and whether the person is also collecting any unemployment.  Starting with, say, a $600 maximum, pay 100 percent of the original weekly salary up to $600, unemployment included."

People want to work.  According to this debilitating and condescending thinking, disadvantaged people are naturally lazy. Congress in these dire times might reconsider this fundamental and dangerous prejudice toward poor people."

Of course, the French peasants responded to Antionette by toppling the monarchy and cutting off her head. And, the modern equivalent of that is what’s these equally insensitive and out of touch Republicans deserve with being booted out of office this November and charged with criminal negligence and reckless endangerment of the public during the greatest health-care crisis in a century."

They should be ashamed of themselves, but they’re not, just like Trump it’s all about holding on to their white, male privilege, which is rapidly coming to an end.

2020-07-27 18:05:32,"Lordy, I think the republicons are right.  Weekly unemployment benes in Mississippi are $235, Arizona $240, Louisiana $247 ... Massachusetts $742.

A Mississippian on unemployment who worked 40 hours/week earns a whopping $5.80 an hour in government handouts.   Mississippi’s minimum wage is $7.25.   Raise the weekly bene by $600 to $835 then the equivalent hourly rate based on 40 hours/week is $20.88.

One doesn’t have to be a math genius republicon to realize that collecting unemployment is the pot of gold at the end of the pandemic rainbow in Biloxi.

So to all those who think $5.80 is too little and $20.88 is too much for a Mississippian then why not supplement the unemployment so that it raises their equivalent hourly wage to the minimum wage which in Mississippi is $7.25.

All states with unemployment rates that pay below the minimum wage should supplement to the minimum wage of their state’s maximum.

Of course to be fair all states where supplements would raise the unemployment above their state’s minimum wage should return that amount to the Treasury so the twitter tyrant can waste it on weekend golf outings, daily covid testing of the White House and other Trumpistan expenditures.

Let’s take Massachusetts as an example.  The maximum weekly minimum wage is $742 equivalent to $18.55 per hour for 40 hours work week.  The minimum wage is $12.75/hour.  Hmmm, a conundrum.  I won’t even go there because some brainiac may just do what I wrote."

Those workers almost invariably then spent the $600/week on food, clothing, rent, utility bills etc.

This meant that the grocers, retail stores, landlords, utilities etc. had cash flowing and thus paid their own workers and stayed financially afloat.

Now we're going to slash this unemployed compensation  payments by two-thirds.  This will mean, of course, that they have far less money to spend on food, clothing, rent, utility bills etc.

Which, of course, means that the grocers, retail stores, landlords, utilities etc. will have reduced cash flow to pay their workers.  Which means many won't stay afloat.

And when those grocers, retail stores, landlords, utilities don't stay afloat they will, of course, layoff their workers adding to the unemployment rolls.

2020-07-27 20:13:42,"$600 extra per week has to end. This was absolutely correct at the beginning of the pandemic unemployment crisis and saved millions from great depression like pain and greased the wheels of the economy. The unintended consequence of the additional $600 plus the state benefit is a disincentive for many to return to work. There are “Help Wanted” signs everywhere.

In North Carolina the total weekly benefit is $950. When annualized this equals $49,400 per year or $23.75 per hour. Not bad considering minimum wage in NC is an embarrassing $7.25 per hour. Extra benefits are still needed because we are still in a crises, but not at a level that discourages active job seeking and crowds out the labor pool for jobs that may pay double or triple minimum wage.

The real take-home message is that $600 per week equals $15 per hour which is the number often floated for a national, livable, minimum wage. The experiment has largely worked - millions could live on $600 per week (if they have affordable healthcare) because millions are not returning to lower wage jobs that have reopened. Another reason for a national, livable minimum wage is creating a benchmark for emergency stimulus.

Now, Republicans in their typical, cruel, heartless fashion want to snatch food out of the mouths of citizens by cutting down the size of the checks so many are having to rely on to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. This is unconscionable and not acceptable.
Our national nightmare can be squarely laid at Trump's feet and those of  Republicans who have followed his lead in what has become an out of control epidemic.  Republic governors in some Red States countermanded city ordinances making wearing a mask mandatory and re-opened their states amidst surging cases of infection.  There are no smoldering ""embers"" there is a raging fire.

People have to either leave the nation for safe havens over time, or prepare as though they will have to survive autonomously. The danger is from within, extending to without. We are viewed as undesirable. Please don't reelect Trump to show the world our nation is basically of good people who simply made a serious mistake electing him. Show the world contrition, and hopefully, they will understand and not fear us. It is our leaders to be feared as they hide behind us as a shield and source of treasure. After these past tumultuous years, I believe our people understand better how important it is to control those who control us. Don't let Trump and Republicans scorn other nations to win your primitive emotional loyalty. Show the world we can control our aggressors at the polls, and time will heal all wounds.

1. With the average MAXIMUM state benefits around $400 per week, meaning most get less, that is a poverty level income. This will cause major stresses on an already stressed population suffering from decades of wage inequalities.
2. Many workers still need to stay home to alleviate an already pitiful response to the pandemic which has allowed the disease to spread and intensify.
3. The previous stimulus bill has saved the economy. J. Powell, the Fed chair, was practically begging legislators to pass more after the first bill. He was emphatic about the need and the ability of the US economy to support and recover from increased spending.
4. The POTUS took no responsibility to direct or pay for pandemic response, delegating to the states.  The states are in dire need because of this.
5. A lack of support for and to the American workers and the help they provide to others will cause even more unrest than we currently have.

The time and money spent calculating a 'fair' 70 percent of wages would surely offset its 'benefit.'

When I review the details on PA's portal I see that my prior earnings are listed as zero; no problem, I've been getting some money. But any percentage of zero would be zero; gig workers out of luck?

But back to the $600.  It does look like a disincentive except for a missing piece of information:

77% of those on unemployment are furloughed.

That means they can be called back at any time - they can't say ""No"" and continue to collects.  To collect you have to be ""willing and able"" to work.  If you file after being offered your job back, that's fraud and easily determined with an email to the company.

Furthermore, we already worked for that $600 - it's our money.  The Rich don't pay much into the Treasury and corporations pay in only 9% of total receipts.

Our POTUS, more interested in poll numbers and reelection (i.e. himself) than you or I staying alive, ignored the CDC guidelines, sided with Republican governors who wanted to open, and harassed Dem. governors following the CDC guidelines, and who continue to do so.  
We are now experiencing another Covid-19 cases spike, (death rates 1,000/day now) because Republican-led States opened too soon and have Covid-19 cases skyrocketing.  Undoubtedly this leads to more closures and an even longer time before people can return to work.   
Senate Republicans propose cutting unemployment benefits, for workers who would be working by now, had the Republican led States adhered to the CDC guidelines.  It is hypocritical, and makes no sense.  The Republicans want to make it worse.  After passing the 2017 $2 trillion tax giveaway to the .1% I heard it would pay for itself.

If unemployment benefits are indeed cut and the stimulus checks appear, ours will be used to help our neighbors pay their bills. We can manage. They cannot."
2020-07-27 21:31:44,It seems to me that both sides of this argument miss the point. It isn't about the amount. The objective is to freeze the economy until you get the other side. These people need wages not unemployment. Pay the wages and keep them employed. You already failed on that do now you are into assistance versus not which is an argument no side is going to win. It would be lovely if the US became sane again.

He doesn't qualify for this, but he can get away with it, and so he is. I just learned they did this, they claim ignoranc e they ""just went to the federal site and pressed this and that on the computer"" and lo look at the money they are getting. I do realize there are people who desperately need help, and I  begrudge them nothing. But I do believe this country out of fairness needs to make sure those who apply and get are deserving of it, and qualify for it. These people have no children to support, in fact they have adult children, grandchildren who can help them. Plus, they stopped paying their mortgage during the recession when their house went underwater -- they were angry at that. So for five years they lived mortgage free and rent free -- and they took A LOT OF CRUISES. I get so angry I can hardly type when I see the typical Times lamenting story making the GOP seem so bad and the Democrats oh so good because it is hardly like that when you look at the realities of things.

I do not dispute that this $600 may be the difference for cash strapped people living paycheck to paycheck suddenly out of work.   But it is perverse that some people are better paid being out of work than in it.

I think that if this amount of additional money is necessary to keep one's head above water, we should have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour or more long ago.   But paying people more to stay home than go to work runs counter to the sensibilities of a society that places value on personal productivity."

It finally arrived at its destination roughly 10-11 weeks after I paid that $75. When I complained about this I was told there was nothing anyone could do about it; people were sick.

After much debate, they decided to change their method of collective farming - where all food belonged to the community - in favor of allotting a portion of land to each family to grow their own crops, with the product of their efforts their own to keep. 

""This had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious,"" wrote William Bradford. ""The women now went willingly into the field, and took their little ones with them to set corn, which before would allege weakness and inability."" He went on in his history to write a prescient and detailed analysis of the shortcomings of collective farming.  

Human nature hasn't changed in 400 years. When we need to live off our own efforts, we find a way. When we don't, we don't. Countless experiments with communism have proven the principle William Bradford outlined.

2020-07-28 02:26:48,"Funny, the GOP takes issue with paying a measly $600 to people who work for a living and are unemployed through no fault of their own.

A common giveaway for a comment by a Trump supporter is that they say they aren't a Trump supporter. Another one is this kind of I know somebody who knows somebody who knows all of these pandemic welfare queens. I'm not buying it because the statistics tell us that Trump's bungling of the pandemic has resulted in tens of millions of laid off or fired workers. And those jobs won't come back until we have solved the pandemic and can reopen safely. So as of now there aren't jobs for them. You could force them to accept a crust of bread for their daily pay. You could shanghai them. You could whip them with a cat o' nine tails. There still wouldn't be jobs available. And they would still need housing, food, health care. They would still have to come up with the mortgage, rent, credit card bills, student loans. To sum up, there almost certainly won't be jobs until what's-his-name is no longer allowed anywhere near the working parts of either the pandemic response or national government"
2020-07-28 02:35:36,"What an insight,  a mask is working! Do we need research to believe a filter is working in both directions? Unnecessarily wearing a mask was politically charged. This is a most stupid act causing death and enormous damage."
2020-07-28 02:54:11,"What exactly were the countless experts at the CDC and NIH doing to prepare for pandemics? This ""discovery"" that it's good to prevent at least some infectious particles from entering your nose and mouth is self-evident. Paper masks cost next to nothing, last in storage for many years, and have little impact on our ability to do things yet the experts never planned for their use."
2020-07-28 03:16:10,"Perhaps someone can answer this with some expertise. If an uninfected individual wearing a mask is more protected by decreasing the exposure to a larger viral load (and thus produces milder symptoms), could an infected person inhale the very viruses they are making —-causing a more severe manifestation? Or is it based on that primary exposure? Thanks in advance."
2020-07-28 03:02:35,"The “duh” factor regarding masks protecting people from becoming infected is monumental. It’s why we all sacrificed having N95s for ourselves -because first responders NEEDED them to -guess what -not become infected. No blame to cast, as far as that need goes, but the disingenuousness of the initial advisory on masks will stand as one of the stupidest mistakes made throughout this fiasco. I do place blame on Trump/Pence/Republicans for not invoking the  Defense Production Act to make N-95 masks by the billions. The fact that we STILL have shortages of these, nasal swabs, and other basic physical goods that keep us safe and allow us to directly address this pandemic in a simple and cost-effective way clearly illustrates the ineptitude of Donald Trump and this entire administration. America can’t do even the simplest of tasks."
2020-07-28 04:27:06,"Evidence that disease severity is determined by the dose of infection seems novel, like being a ""little pregnant"".  Nonetheless, just the possibility that it's true, makes wearing a mask all the more compelling."
2020-07-28 03:57:00,"Trump has figured out that if he states opposing points of view at different times....don’t wear a mask....wear a mask....don’t wear a mask, if there is a consequence to holding one of those viewpoints, he just points to the time he said X, while accusing the media of being fake and his followers forgive him. Or maybe they don’t notice. Whatever."
2020-07-28 03:58:32,"If masks didn’t protect the people wearing them, why have medical professionals been wearing masks around the infected? These studies are just reconfirming the science we already knew as common sense."
2020-07-28 04:07:05,"We need to stop thinking about doing what we *want* to do and start thinking about what we *need* to do.  The virus doesn't care what we want. If we do *anything* that increases close contact interactions among humans the virus *will* spread. 

We can't wish away physics, physiology, or epidemiology because we want to eat inside a restaurant or drink in a bar or go to the beach.  Lock it down hard until the virus is starved of new victims and burns itself out.  While that brings with it its own pain, it's the quickest way to end it. 

The alternative is to slowly sicken or kill an untold number of people and the toll is already way too high."

They have been using and manipulating these supplies for over 5 months now by withholding  and threatening states, the Governors and Mayors to open up schools and businesses during a raging pandemic.   

This is why no one can get a mask or a test.  Are they are making money on this scheme somehow?   Something really bad is going on here.  5 months! and no adequate masks, no tests, no medical equipment?   This really stinks of corruption!!"

It’s been painfully frustrating reading each revelation by the so-called experts on masks."
2020-07-28 04:09:54,"How is it even a question whether a mask helps protect the wearer? Even a terrible bandana will protect you a bit; it's not a yes/no question but a how much question. Regardless of how did our society become so quantitatively illiterate, we need news media to hold itself to a higher standard for critical thinking."
2020-07-28 03:33:57,"Dr. Birx has lost all credibility in my mind. I do not think she will be seen as helpful when this virus has come to pass.

Initially, I get reserving the short supply for frontline health workers. But we are far from that starting point and manufacturers just fear there is no profit in it for them. Why are the vast majority now relegated to throwing some version of a T-shirt or a bandanna over their faces, when we know how much less effective these are?￼￼ 

I also find it strange that efficacy of various kinds of masks is still pretty difficult to find serious journalism about. We are now collectively calling whatever people throw on their face a mask but there is a world of difference between 3M technology that blocks down to .3 µm and that silly linen thing with hummingbirds on it you’ve gotten from Etsy."

2020-07-28 03:50:54,"Republicans slashed the $600 unemployment benefit down to $200 and think this is ok?    That $600 barely kept people from going hungry or kept the lights on!   How do republicans expect us to live?   Trump is doing nothing to fight this virus pandemic but expects us and our children to gladly go out and get infected!    

They are monsters!   Vote them out.  Until then how about a 2nd Impeachment for allowing Bounties for American Soldiers?"
2020-07-28 04:36:31,"Trump has ordered all the virus data coming from hospitals, morgues, nursing homes to report to a private company, TelTracking, not the CDC, and then send on the data to the WH CovidTaskforce.   TelTracking’s data collection will not be made public as it was when the CDC was in charge.

Trump has not only SILENCED the CDC but also BLINDED the CDC.  We will no longer know the number of virus cases or body counts in our country!   Trump can manipulate the information to suit him and the other republican’s re-election.    Trump and his enabler republicans are beyond evil!"

Where have those experts been.  I have been a nurse for over 50 years.  During my nursing experience I took care of people with measles, chicken pox, polio,pertussis, and even tuberculosis.  There were wards specifically for infectious diseases.  
We wore protective equipment:  masks, gowns, gloves and sometimes caps and shoe coverings.
This was not to prevent me from spreading germs to people with communicable diseases.  
It was to protect me from getting those diseases.

It is amazing to learn that the experts are just now learning that these masks protect the wearer.  We knew it 50 years ago."

I’ve called and emailed my state representatives and state senators every couple of months.  They usually respond to my messages so I know they are listening.  I try to donate $5-10 at a time to candidates whenever I can, even though I’m on social security retirement.  I feel so good when I donate and can do something patriotic.  I joined a local Democrat club here in my town in 2017 and they keep me up on important information by emails and texts.

2020-07-28 09:39:04,"I think we are all painfully aware that Trump and his base love conspiracy theories, from 'fake' this to 'deep' that, they seem to have a never ending supply. Wouldn't it be ironic, and definitely poetic, if one got started that Trump were the mastermind behind this virus so he would benefit financially?

Think about it (hopefully not too hard), the evidence is all there. A lackadaisical response, pointing the finger to deflect away from himself, trillions thrown at the problem with little transparency, silencing of the experts, and a man seemingly in debt to an foreign oligarch. Boy, I sure hope I don't end up in as much danger as Darby Shaw was.

Yup, poetic justice for the King of Conspiracy."

2020-07-28 05:53:10,"This is utterly, insanely inane! The USA is still debating this issue when the whole world, at least the portion that has been successful against this virus, has been convinced of its usefulness for a long time. 

Looking at the photos in NYT, we also knew they were helpful during the 1918 flu pandemic, but somehow we let the know-nothings of our era convince the gullible “base” otherwise."
2020-07-28 07:54:25,"Trump is thoroughly fake and is telling lies and fantasies all the time. The US can't fight a threat in the real world when your government, and enough fanatical followers, live in an ever changing incoherent made up fantasy world.

It will not help to hide the real numbers and casualties. It is not even certain humans can achieve lasting immunity by infection or vaccines. Letting the virus ravage the land is a gamble no human efforts can control, it is simply unconditional surrender to the virus. The US could and should have controlled the virus months ago.

The virus simply exists, and it can't even disappear by some magical fantasy. It's just a common condition we must fight, contain and eventually eradicate.

But in the US your president and his government tells porkies and fantasies all the time, try to monopolize equipment and data to profit from the pandemic, try to destroy the working efforts in the states able to cooperate collectively and coherently in the common interest. Stir up trouble and incite violence. 

It was always a challenge for the US to establish a national unity to fight a common threat, but with Trump it is impossible. Trump can always count on some 25% to sabotage the collective efforts. He did sabotage your lock-down efforts and squandered trillions.

The new relief package to help many millions of Americans survive the next months, is only needed because your president utterly failed all of you. But with Trump it will not be the last."

2020-07-28 10:21:04,When I heard comments early in this pandemic that masks were ineffective (even Fauci was discouraging them) my immediate conclusion was that the entire world had gone mad.  Fauci’s explanation was that we should reserve them for health professionals.  That one never made sense either since all you need to make one is a handkerchief and two rubber bands or a needle and some thread.  With so many cases of the Coronavirus why haven’t the governments of the world done enough research to confirm what any sane person already knows—if you can’t breath in the virus you most likely won’t get the virus.
2020-07-28 12:36:50,I’m happy to see this article. The prevailing message- to wear a mask to protect your neighbor- is failing because it goes against the human instinct for self protection first.

2020-07-28 11:37:01,"At the end of this - by which I mean this administration, and not this pandemic, and so which hopefully means January, if not sooner - I suspect we will find that Trump and his family and conspirators have been profiting off hydroxy-chloroquine, N-95 masks, ventilators, and whatever other equipment is a crucial part of our healthcare supply chain. I just hope Biden and Co have the stomach to prosecute, jail, or condemn them for their corruption and outright treason."
2020-07-28 13:20:58,"The myth of the efficacy of capitalism flies in the face of fact. It costs us a fortune to maintain.

Fly across the pond to France (oops you're banned) and buy a cellphone plan or some hearing aids. The cost of a phone plan is dramatically lower because the government doesn't allow monolithic control of the market. The cost of your hearing aids will be the same, BUT you'll get a five year warranty (as opposed to a one year plan here in the States for the exact same aids) because the government there used its clout to negotiate on your behalf. 

The status quo depends upon Americans never learning that unfettered capitalism is only good for the limited number of unfettered capitalists. Stop drinking the Free Market Koolaid."
2020-07-28 16:42:09,"People who say that science should guide decisions need to take a look at the science behind the wearing of masks. The World Health Organization stated well that there is no scientific evidence showing that masks help reduce transmission of the flu virus: 

""Although there is no evidence that this is effective
in reducing transmission, there is mechanistic plausibility for the
potential effectiveness of this measure.""

It is certainly plausible that masks help. But scientists have been looking for decades for evidence that masks help stop the transmission of viral infections and so far they haven't found any. If the effect were significant, it is likely that they would have. 

Yet many politicians tout masks as being an effective measure that will stem the tide of the Covid-19 disease epidemic. There's just no evidence that that is the case. Masks should not be used as a fetish, or a talisman. If you require their use, politicians, recognize that you are not basing the requirement on science but as a possible precaution that may help."

The real unethical part is doing next to nothing to better understand this virus.  We already know that the mortality rate for healthy humans in their 20's is very low, as in under .01% or even lower.  And they don't even have to use COVID as a medium.  I'm sure there's plenty of airborne biologic particles with similar characteristics that can be used to directly test the efficacy of various blocking techniques.  And it gets worse.  Existing proper masks have undergone extensive testing for safety.  Meaning that mask material inhalant risks have been properly evaluated.  No such thing has been done with the adhoc options."

When a bearded friend commented it was impossible to find a decent face mask to accommodate his furry face I created an extended version and am marketing it as ""beard friendly.""  At first I followed the recommendation to use tightly woven fabrics that you ""can't see light through"" but realistically most people who are not used to wearing dust masks or N95s in their normal work will find it difficult to breathe through these tightly woven  fabrics.  I now seek breathable,  natural fiber fabrics.  Linen is great for summer.  I use vintage fabrics gleaned from thrift shop garments, lightweight sew-on interfacing, t-shirt yarn with spring toggles for ties, fabric-wrapped coffee bag ties for nose clips.  Each mask has at least 14 pieces and takes me 4 hours to build so, unlike Gucci who can charge $100 for a mask that looks like a Kotex pad, I can't charge a living wage for my creations, nor do I think my design could ever be mass-produced.  Until people start treating face masks like fine shoes or lingerie and are willing to pay decent prices for good ones, there will be little motivation to improve designs and we'll hear nothing but belly aches about how awful they are because the el cheapo ones out there really are terrible."

Particle trapping layers could be concealed underneath."

Looking fashion-forward or wearing what could be a useless mask may not actually have any effect on stopping the spread of the virus.

We are once again left to make our own uninformed personal decisions regarding this virus as with so many other decisions like whether or not to send our kids back to school.

I tried inserting coffee filters but they proved to be too stiff and then read that they weren’t that effective. Now inset a folded tissue to make 6 layers. The mask is held up by my glasses and the firm knotting on the back of my neck so ‘mask’ comes under my ears and doesn’t interfere with my hearing aids. In hot weather , it also absorbs perspiration."

Throughout the year one can see poor air quality in New Delhi. Citizens, almost all, use permanently use face masks.

When people reference minutes to distance, I tell them that only works for the speed of light, otherwise it confuses me. It's the same with masks, which I find ugly on others and uncomfortable on me. I where it where advised, inside a public place or in close proximity to others outside, not in an open an bucolic park. I act responsibly, not politically correct."

How about just wear a mask all the time without excuses and wear it correctly.?

Of course, I am only given one for a shift. You should see it after I've worn it inside a PAPR hood (we share these too, making the mask inside necessary) for a couple hours. I love the creativity and problem-solving covered in this article, but want to remind everyone that frontline healthcare workers STILL DO NOT HAVE BASIC PPE. We have become completely inured to the images of ICU and ER staff wearing a hodgepodge of self-procured respirators, often construction or welding-grade (that is, if your hospital even 'allows' you to wear personal PPE). People are buying non-NIOSH certified respirators on eBay, and being price-gouged at the same time. 
I would really like article that could explain why frontline healthcare workers (who can furnish credentials if needed) are not allowed to purchase powered air-purifying respirators directly from manufacturers or even third-parties. I have been trying for 4 months to purchase my own in case I decide to take a travel nursing assignment in a COVID unit, where I will not be guaranteed a PAPR (N95s don't fit my face).

Enterprising businesses can even buy discrete advertising “space” in the masks for a fee that would contribute to the project.   Mask wearing us hereto stay.  If people want business to open to as a normal status as permissible, this is the answer.    The US Postal Service can even deliver to all homes."
2020-07-27 17:17:20,It is ironic but if Trump had taken the lead in wearing masks early in the Pandemic the mask could have been a great election tool. Apart from the obvious public safety concern the Trump Mask could have become the symbol of patriotism and affirmation of support for Trump. Good policy is good government. Masks made in America for the benefit of Americans might have swept Trump to four more years. Strategic thinking can be very effective Mr. President. Too late now.
2020-07-27 17:30:33,It would be great if the quality N95 and P100 masks were less ugly.  The N95 masks filters 95% of virus laden water molecules.  The P100 masks filters 100% virus laden water molecules.  I would be great if the NYT spent the same amount of copy promoting the masks that truly protect the user.  Using the N95 and P100 quality masks to smother covid infection in  'hot' zip codes needs to be promoted and put into effect.  Using quality masks in these areas will be effective and inexpensive.

If they were available schools, businesses and doctors’ offices could show people how to wear them safely and then we might really be able to reopen and still get control of the virus.

On the other hand, I appreciate original
fashion and colors, and if masks became somehow ‘cool’ because they look nicer, this could encourage more people to wear them, esp the young who want to look hip.

This is not rocket science, people. The reusable mask I'm wearing on my avatar is a N100 mask that has been on the market for more than ten years, and it costs less than 50 USD, i.e. considerably less than the trinkets mentioned in the article. 

The question really seems to be: Do you want to survive, or do you prefer to die pretty? This not should be a difficult question. 

On a sidenote, we need to understand that the medical N95 disposable masks are environmentally disastrous. They are made of non-degradable very fine nonwoven polypropylene fabric that will break down to microplastics in a heartbeat, because in one dimension it is already that.

I am generally a very private person, and have always found going out into the world to be exhausting. Being able to wear a mask has helped to reduce some of that exhaustion.

Compare that situation with the US, where masks remain difficult to find even after 4 months and often cost $10 or more. Here you generally have to order masks by mail, which means you can't see the mask (except in a potentially misleading photo) before you buy it. 

The result: most masks I've bought have been too small for my face (I'm an adult man), and the fit gets worse with daily washing and shrinkage. I've bought or been given 8 masks so far, and only 2 are a comfortable fit. If only America were an advanced industrial democracy like Japan!"
2020-07-27 20:42:52,"(1) @NYTimes, please stop dismissively referring to surgical masks as ""cheap"". Call them what they are: ""affordable and extremely effective,albeit plain"". 

Surgical masks are extremely effective when worn properly; medical center testing shows they are within 1 %age point of N95s in filtration ability. 

And their efficacy can be greatly improved by using the simple 3-rubber band technique that engineers have designed to prevent gapping in surgical masks. This could prevent gapping in any mask. 

FixTheMask.com (absolutely free, no registration required).

(2) This trend towards selling masks without regard to whether they are effective can actually WORSEN the epidemic, and the health risk to the individual wearing them, unless efficacy is taken into account. 

Wearing a mask (e.g., made of pearls, or with a vent) that cannot possibly decrease transmission but which allow the wearer to *nominally* comply with regulations militates against public health. 

Such masks should be visibly labeled with a symbol that indicate they don't comply with mask regulations unless worn *over* a mask that decreases infectious transmission. 

When worn over an effective mask, I think it's a great idea."

Stanford University medical scientists who have worked with the CDC and WHO in the past wrote the following in June:

""What’s the best way to make and use a mask? 

Our studies show that, if constructed properly with high-quality materials, a homemade cloth mask can function as well as or better than a surgical mask. Based on our studies, the WHO now recommends a cloth mask of at least three layers of different materials. The outermost layer should be made of a fabric that is at least somewhat water resistant. That can be a fabric that is a combination of cotton and polyester, nylon or rayon. The middle layer should either be a polypropylene — a spunbond material used in some reusable grocery bags, mattress covers and craft projects — or three-ply disposable facial tissues like Kleenex. Finally, the innermost layer should be a wicking material to draw moisture away from the face. One hundred percent soft cotton works well here."""

2020-07-27 21:26:05,"Covering the nose and mouth with a mask is absolutely vital in these times of a novel virus pandemic.  My question is why are plastic face shields not promoted?  

A facd shield not only covers the nose and mouth, but eyes, as well.  If it fits properly it will cover the whole face from hairline to many inches below the chin and wrap around the face to the ears.  Some have a slight gap at the sides of the face which can be remedied by inserting ties on either side in order to pull it taut eliminating that gap.

A face shield can be worn multiple times, cleaned with soap and water.  According to tests done by JAMA, (Journal of the American Medical Association), if you practice social distancing a shield is more protective than a cloth mask as it places a solid barrier between you and others.  In hospital settings where a mask and shield are worn is when hospital personnel are inches away from the patient.

Wearing a face shield enables others to see your lips move; better to hear you.  And, best of all, one can see a smile."

How can it be that the same country that had  men walking on the moon in the 1960's can not procure N-95 masks for  Americans
in 2020?

It's a matter of priorities.  

It's   implausible that the U.S. has been unable to produce or  produce N-95s  and to provide them to every American, after all these months."
2020-07-27 22:04:49,I have been teaching in Tokyo for 30+ years and there are always 3 or 4 masked students in every class. It increases in the winter to  almost half during flu season. Necessary on crowded public transportation and a boon to those who don’t want to put on makeup. We are simply used to it. It took me a decade before I was convinced. I am a slow learner.

When I saw a Portuguese fashion designer 3 mos ago post on her Instagram account stunning masks to coordinate with her outfits she designs, I knew then, we’ll see them on runways and are here to stay.

The mask works pretty well except that the over-the-head band always wants to slip down. Fortunately, I'm retired so I don't have to wear a mask for hours.

My wife did is using a paper towel, bigger rubber bands, and plastic tapes, which turned out to be pretty comfortable.

Masks with vents or fans are less than useless for this purpose.

2. find masks made by 3M but NOT made in China.

I don’t care what they look like as long as we can find everyday masks, and emergency N95s (not KN95) for situations where an everyday mask is inadequate. 

Why did Trump seize the federal and consumer supply chain, and then sell our supplies to China and who knows where else? Why do I see people in every other nation, including third worlds, with PPE, but Americans are forced to wear homemade masks made of bandanas, T shirts and pillow cases?"

They suggest a two-layer cloth mask, the inner layer being cotton and the outer layer being tightly woven smooth synthetic like polyester. A fabric store website mentions that they were told that you should not be able to blow out a candle while wearing the mask, and not able to see the weave or threads of the mask fabrics when you hold it up to a bright light."

2020-07-27 16:34:50,"People are busy making masks look more fashionable or more expensive or with more gold and diamonds. In a sane world, people would be trying to make masks that do a better job of filtering out the virus, thereby protecting the wearer and the people around the mask wearer. Making masks more comfortable to wear, so that people could actually wear them properly for hours at a stretch without having to pull them down frequently, would also be worthwhile. Instead, fashion is what we are focusing on. 

Meanwhile, 16 million are infected already, with hundreds of millions more to come. Six hundred thousand are dead already, with many more certain to die in the next few months. The virus is winning, because it deserves to win. Anyone and anything deserves to win against a supposedly sentient species that does not value self preservation over fashion."
2020-07-28 04:51:48,"There is too little news on mask technology and effectiveness. If this had something to do with cars, I'm sure there would be at least a few hundred TV shows describing how snazzy the car looked and how fast it could filter the virus.

I wish a reputed organization, unbiased and unrelated to mask manufacturing groups would create relevant tests and publish qualitative data on masks for ordinary people. Of course, the price of the mask must be a factor. Ideally, this would be under the auspices of the WHO, but we no longer trust WHO and the CDC, so it might have to be a South Korean government organization. Most of the parameters related to N95 and the like assume ideal fit and ideal use (like disposal of the mask after every use). The rules have changed, and the tests should reflect the world we live in now."
2020-07-27 17:12:55,"Somehow, we - I mean all humans everywhere -should be able to build a world where life is livable in more places than USA, Europe and Australia. So people can live in dignity where they happen to be born and, should they decide to immigrate, they do it legally, with dignity, for reasons other than utter despair.   No matter how many people leave Guatemala because they find life impossible, there will always be more staying in Guatemala, feeling miserable and only dreaming of leaving.  This is not a sustainable solution, no matter how nice and open we make the US immigration system.  The solution is to make life livable in Guatemala (just an example).  Guatemalans should come up with solutions and tell us how we can help.  And yes, I know, in the fifties the US intervened, not for the good.  Maybe we can do better now?  Considering that so many believe they can find happiness in the US, maybe they should emulate the US system?  Have local officials shadow mayors and governors and police commissioners and then implement the system?  There must some alternative to mass immigration."
2020-07-27 17:45:15,"The original immigration regulations were quite strict on NOT ADMITTING anyone without a sponsor to provide a job, housing, social services, etc.

They were quite specific that no-one would be admitted who would be burden to government.

In fact, the shipping companies were forced to take them back at the companies expense; and in time, the companies enforced our immigration restrictions to save the costs involved. 

The result was 'cherry picking' and many think it was that policy which made America Great.

Now we are expected to rescue every 'basket case' who reaches our shores, usually with a ticket provided by some humanitarian organization. 

This really isn't sustainable, since there are millions at the bottom of foreign societies who want out of socialist states where the government 'takes care of you'. So they come here for better subsidies and there is no end of them; esp. those with extended families of 20+ members and led by a cute child snuck in by a coyote."

2020-07-27 18:20:20,"Yet another scathing indictment of the shareholder-driven model of globalization based on neoliberal economics that has been blindly practiced with religious zeal for the past four decades, which has failed along every conceivable dimension.

It has failed so spectacularly, in fact, that now even the only thing globalization cheerleaders have left, the absurd ""OK, OK. So we got just about everything about globalization wrong. But look how many people it has lifted out of poverty!"" is being repudiated more and more with each and every passing day. 

Globalization has been a colossal failure. Hard stop.

It has failed for developing countries and developed countries alike. 

One exception is China, of course, which has done rather well. 

Indeed, the ""gains"" of the past 40 glorious years of globalization will be reversed for the vast majority of the ""winners"" over the course of the next 40 weeks.  

Hundreds of millions will fall back into abject poverty in the developing world. 

Hundreds of millions will go backwards economically in the developed world, which has already been destabilized from the failure of globalization.

The economists, CEOs, MBAs, Management Consultants, Wall Street analysts, and journalists that perpetrated this historic bait-and-switch are going to have a lot to answer for to the American Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Globalization that will be convened sometime towards the end of this decade, as the Globalization Wars of the 2020s wind down."

Charity begins at home. If Western nations want to give these migrants a few hundred dollars for a fresh start back where they belong, along with a one way plane, bus, train or boat ticket home, I have no objection to that.

Far from alleviating poverty, forced low-skilled labour migration devastates whole continents by draining them of human resources needed for economic development. It also depresses the wages in the rich countries, keeping workers there unsecured and underemployed.

Only politics and a short-sighted focus on quarterly results get in the way.

I finally ended up going to the emergency room once my fever broke 105. There, I tested negative for the flu, and I was so bad that the doctor asked if I had AIDS. (I've since tested negative for that..). The doctors found that I had pneumonia setting in as well, not an uncommon secondary infection. Thankfully, I recovered pretty quickly afterwards with the help of antibiotics for the pneumonia. 

Now, granted I know covid is viral, and the antibiotics are what seemed to help me the most, but remembering this illness, at my annual physical a few weeks ago, I asked my doctor if I could take a COVID antibody test, and he was convinced enough that I that he ordered a test. I was really disappointed when the results came back negative. Nonetheless, knowing that there are limits to detection, and that immunity does wane, I'm still left wondering if I did have it. I guess I'll have to assume I didn't. I have to imagine there are millions out there like me who may have also had it, but it's too bad we'll never know for certain."
2020-07-27 16:32:09,"This article states without citation that “the vast majority of people who become infected with the coronavirus have few to no symptoms.”  This is a very strong statement; what is the evidence for it? Fewer that 50% are asymptomatic, so the majority of people have at least some symptoms. What is the purpose of lumping together the asymptomatic with those who only have a “few” symptoms. Is the implication that those with a “few” symptoms are only lightly inconvenienced similar to the asymptomatic? I have not seen evidence of this — the majority of those who have symptoms seem to report that those symptoms are fairly unpleasant and long-lasting even when they aren’t hospitalized. 

Statements like this seem to incorrectly minimize the impact of catching Covid-19, and is in addition is either false, or is falsely conflating those with few but severe symptoms with those who are asymptomatic (many of whom have undetected long term damage we are now learning). There is no need to minimize the severity of this when discussing elusive antibody measurements."
2020-07-27 16:42:37,"Thanks for this interesting reportage. There have been reports that certain parts of NYC have population infections as high as 68%. However, what we’re hoping for is “cell-mediated immunity”, not just the presence of antibodies. 

High population percentages of antibodies will not presage herd immunity from a second wave for specific parts of the country, even NYC. 

Because Tom Hanks, one of the earlier cases of those infected and hospitalized back in March, recently disclosed after having fully recovered, that his levels of antibodies were initially high but lately had dropped significantly. That may suggest that his immunity may not be long lasting, unless his T cells have also been “trained” for cell-mediated immunity, which supposedly is much longer lasting. 

Isn’t it the unique thing about a “novel” coronavirus that appears to be highly contagious and deleterious? We will not truly know all its characteristics until it is no longer novel."

Researchers at the Karolinksa Institute in Sweden tested 200 people for both antibodies and T-cells.

Some were blood donors while others were tracked down from the group of people first infected in Sweden, mainly returning from earlier affected areas like northern Italy.

This could mean a wider group have some level of immunity to Covid-19 than antibody testing figures, like those published as part of the UK Office for National Statistics Infection Survey, suggest.""

The right test will be indeed critical if / when vaccines become available and major labs will be asked to properly confirm (if established) immunity."
2020-07-27 21:36:29,"Lasting immunity towards a Corona type virus? That would be a first in modern medicine.

Maybe this time humankind might find a key to lasting vaccines, maybe not. But kindly remember we do not have lasting vaccines against other similar vira, though research labs have tried for many decades. The annual flue shot is a very good example, it will not provide lasting immunity, and sometimes miss the dominant virus in a flue season.

This time there's no lack of funding, billions are virtually thrown at many attempts. And many billions more are ""made"" by insiders on the stock market, gambling on these attempts as they achieve public funding.

But even if a new vaccine only provides immunity for some 3-5 months it still might help isolating and starving the virus of new victims, if the world simultaneously can vaccinate billions of people.

Meanwhile the successful nations are employing the old proven methods of virus limitation, namely isolation, containment, test and trace. 

However, the world cannot beat the virus with unwilling and uncaring governments and large groups in the population, like the Trump administration and his fanatical followers in the US population. These old methods demand almost unanimous participation, some 20% nutcases are enough to destroy collective efforts.

Seeing how one's coworker perform their jobs and seeing first hand how a company functions overall lays the groundwork for career advancement. 
How do you mentor a college student from home? Invite them to your kitchen table for an internship opportunity.
This rush for everyone to work from home is very shortsighted. I would not doubt that it would contribute to a lower regard for those that work from home when compared to those working in an office setting."
2020-07-27 19:22:17,"For some, a collaborative environment is certainly preferable. But that is by no means a universal truth. I for one have no such inclination, and have always much preferred to work creatively in private. Different strokes. But both the nature of your work and your extrovert/introvert personality have a lot to do with those preferences.

Conversely, it may be that the young & aggressive in their first professional juices will be drawn to urban, congested environs, and centralized offices of larger firms, only to get past that with age, and move out to a more rural and stable homestead from which to work remotely for most of their career, and raise families. Versions of this model are ancient. But in recent times, urban proximity was generally necessary to find promising employment (which was not tied to the land) for most people.

More significantly, economic circumstances will hopefully spur innovation in collaboration communications options. Current offerings don’t meet the needs at present, so it’s not surprising that we come up short in trying to abruptly shift to distributed employment with no transition. Need being the most efficient incentive, I see much opportunity for innovation in that direction. Science fiction has pursued many potential avenues.

But for now, there will be plenty of pain to go around. The technologically adaptive, frugal, and self-sufficient will fare best. Also, this will shake down a lot of frothy enterprise that couldn’t support its own weight."
2020-07-27 19:47:43,"In the short term, working from home is a viable solution.  In the long term, it will probably join other experiments like ""the open office"" concept, the ""no fixed workspace"" office, and the ""bring everybody into once space"" concept (which is basically the opposite of what's happening now).

I'm going to put this out there:  The people who truly enjoy working from home right now love their work, but hate their co-workers.  There's no way around that.  ""Why do I have to come in to do this when I can just do it all alone in a room by myself"" is the key.

Working from home works *right now* because of the legwork we all put in to get to know each other in advance.  That's a lot of built-up goodwill and trust that we've banked and are now drawing upon.  The longer this goes on

If you think this is sustainable forever, here's a thought exercise:  Do you think that you could put together a 50,000 employee corporation never meeting a single person face to face?  All hiring, interactions, etc. done remotely?  Never see your co-worker...only their avatar?  

Doubtful.

In my opinion, those who think we can continue to never see each other face to face or work side by side are probably the same sorts who thought that the internet - and the explosion of information - would make truth reign supreme.  We've seen exactly the opposite."

I've a friend who couldn't understand why I was so unhappy to work from home...I think she thought I was simply 'complaining' for no good reason...that perhaps I didn't fully appreciate how 'lucky' I was.

But then one day I started to get into more detail as to why it is a struggle for me, and then she finally understood.

I live in a small apartment. No separate office space.  Sit at my little kitchen table to do work-work.  No space for special furniture or ergonomic setup.  Under lockdown, the hours/days/week are a blur.  No one coming or going to break up my day/monotony.  I'm staring at same 4 walls, with no option to work now and then from my midtown office, the library or a coffeehouse.  I'm hunched over my keyboard.  Sure, I can get up now and then, stretch etc., but...it's still boring work, bad for me physically and mentally.   During the intense NYC lockdown in March/April, I felt like I was in a prison, going mental.

Even now, with the easing up of the lockdown, and the nicer weather which allows for walks, etc., it's still a challenge to WFH in a small apartment.  Plus I don't like my job either, so there's that.  ;-)"

Whether via cubicle farms or open floor plans, this approach is poorly positioned for physical distancing.  I'm going to take the contrary view that employers need to transition back to much-higher sf per employee, even if it means lower profit margins.  Otherwise the tiny percentage of employees and managers who still have traditional offices will steamroll everyone else.  These are the people who have already begun transitioning back to the office buildings.  Their ability to network in person, collaborate, mentor, perform OJT, and build face-to-face work relationships will leave everyone else in the dust."

You get the best of both worlds as a result. Less pollution from commute, less physical contact for spreading diseases, and more focus and time with clear boundaries between being overloaded with meetings vs getting to work.

Not everyone is an extrovert or an introvert. We need to find a balance between the two."

They expect us to pay for the set up we need, not them.  Then there is the fact that most of us are spending more on utility bills, phone bills, etc. simply by working from home.  And we can't claim it as a deduction on our taxes.  (We used to be able to do that but changes in the tax laws made it next to impossible to do.)

There are other issues with WFH.  Privacy, if a family member needs attention, the blurring boundary between work and home life, the ability to collaborate over Zoom or whatever the company uses, and those off the cuff conversations that can inspire a new idea.  

There's a huge disconnect in America between what is needed to succeed and what our politicians and employers think we need.  We need decent pay so we can have decent lives.  We need a better social safety net, a real medical care system, unions to protect us from arbitrary firings, etc.  WFH doesn't address these issues at all.

It is that time again to get the 2020-2021 seasonal flu vaccine that has been shipped in our direction. I want to be the first in line before it runs out.  It is not that simple. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, I got the swine flu before the vaccine was available. That flu did not kill me but it did not make me stronger and every year I lined up to the get the seasonal flu vaccine. I am not one of those who thinks flu is no big deal. Anything that can cause temperature elevation and makes you feel sick needs to be avoided like a plague because it is unpredictable how the progression can take place. That uncertainty will force me to try and be the first in line for the COVID-19 vaccine hopefully before the cows come home. I don't think I want to take my chances for too long.

Contrast that with the way in which defense contractors get cost-plus, price adjusted contracts and then use the development of those to make profits selling to foreign governments.  Taxpayers don't benefit.

And now pharma is in that sweet spot.  Instead of handouts, the government should have taken some ownership with buy back options for the companies.  When they do well, so do we all.  The decision could have been made to divest of those ownership shares early, just as some executives have.  How about a seven times increase in those investments for taxpayers too?

But it shouldn't stop there.  Because of those injections of cash that, if vaccine development is successful, those companies will have future growth and earnings beyond what they otherwise would have.

I agree that exaggerated and misleading claims should be investigated by the SEC but when you target smaller companies like Moderna and ignore a Pfizer, that creates mistrust in the reporting agencies. In this case both companies hyped their phase 1 data without peer review.  Moderna was later criticized in the media while Pfizer remains unscathed. 

It makes you wonder if it’s because they’re bigger and have more powerful influential players backing them. And this report makes me wonder of the influence big pharma has on NYT for it seems to target the smaller pharma companies while turning a blind eye to the big players.

The main effect this report will have is to boost the stock price of big pharma at the expense of the smaller ones listed here. Therefore,  I think NYT should divulge whether executive management owns stock of any these pharma companies large or small."

It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,

(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.""

There are alternatives to consider to benefit the taxpaying public more directly. These include:

1. Taking an equity position in the companies that we subsidize. (Treasury will gain from dividends and stock  appreciation.)

2. A great deal of basic, fundamental research is carried out in publicly funded research labs. Reason? Private companies simply are not willing to underwrite the inherent risks involved in basic research that does not produce short term results. Ask Bill Gates!

Many patents arising from our research can be licensed to private entities for royalty fees. Or, we may contract out production of vaccines and other pharma products for negotiated prices.

3. Our government may choose to build its own manufacturing facilities to produce vaccines and pharma products. (We build research labs, why not plants to produce?)

And, if necessary, Trump’s crew of political commissars will be expanded in key departments like the CDC and the FDA. Per reports in the Times, I t’s already happening.

Trump’s pivot to concern about the pandemic is transparently self serving. His press briefings have been resurrected from the dead, and so far have only been spin machines to emphasize his administration’s supposed achievements in fighting the virus. Those, and his desire to reopen every school despite the danger from crowded gatherings that are too great to hold his convention.

Trump has done nothing to improve the federal response to a pandemic that is increasingly out of control. He’s largely silenced his medical experts. (Notice they’re not in the room where the briefings happen.) Worse, he’s countenanced public denigration of Dr. Fauci to the extent he now gets regular death threats and needs federal protection. The vaccine effort, as important as it is, will be twisted to his political ends.

Meanwhile, investors and executives are cashing in now. The vaccine development game is a near zero sum game. Only a few will be the best and get rewarded by massive purchases. That’s our American system to deal with a plague."

2020-07-25 17:26:37,"What drives our economy is the competition to make money.  Any method or gimmick that makes money is good for those for whom it works, and if they are smart they will distribute some of that money to people whose cooperation is needed to keep the method or gimmick going.

This is the way things work here.  Other countries have governments that get in the way of things that work in this manner.  We decided that our government should get out of the way, and instead assist those who are making much money; these people and institutions in turn kick in to preserve a government that gets out of their way.  

Changing the way things work is socialism, big government, high taxes, and pandering to losers.  Blacks do not live as long as whites, and poor people do not live as long as the wealthy.  Changing this is pandering to losers unless it is designed to fail, in which case it is a successful strategy to gaslight losers by giving them the illusion that something is being done while keeping the distribution of life and money the way it is.

Few of us understand how things actually work, and this is no accident.  But we do understand that attempting to change how things work may make them work less well (the Venezuela argument).  Making sure changes have this result is the best way to get them rolled back."

The claim that ""sales had been scheduled in advance through programs that automatically sell executives’ shares if the stock hits a certain price"" is utter nonsense.

If the company later fails to come up with a vaccine or cure, and the company's stock tanks, is that the company's fault or the investors' fault?

I've also heard, however -- and this makes great sense to me -- that the ""big money"" in the pharmaceutical business comes instead from drugs that get taken every day, not from vaccines, which tend to generate a lot of lawsuits when they don't work.

If someone comes up with an effective vaccine for COVID-19, that may be different. If indulging the profit motive is necessary to induce researchers to try for that, I say ""Indulge the profit motive."" As matters now stand, a would-be vaccine developer must not only come up with a safe and effective vaccine, but also persuade an increasingly skeptical public that the vaccine is safe and effective. If overcoming those considerable hurdles makes the developer rich, so be it. If the developer gets too greedy, I'll change my view, but I'm prepared to pay a very high price for a safe and effective vaccine."

The companies don't get this money in the first place -- ""investors"" do.

In any case, only other ""investors"" (aka ""speculators"") are harmed, and -- pardon me -- I don't feel too sorry for those ""investors."" In some cases, the company itself exaggerates (in which cases I count on the SEC to step in), but usually it's just one speculator who hasn't carefully read the company's press release selling to another speculator who hasn't read it at all.

""Get rid of Hedge fund speculators ... ""

The question is: Is the hedge fund really a speculator (I'm a lawyer, and have represented many of them) or did the hedge fund simply invest much-needed capital in a company that was trying to develop a vaccine for some loathsome disease, with no guarantee of success? If the latter, should the hedge fund's upside be limited if the company succeeds? If so, should the government (i.e., you and me, aka ""taxpayers"") pay money to that company's competitors who tried but failed to develop a vaccine for that loathsome disease? Or should those unsuccessful competitors be stiffed? Do you think they'll try to develop a vaccine for some other loathsome disease if they're stiffed?

I presume you would not require that American taxpayers pay ""failed"" vaccine developers. Should we nevertheless tell the successful developer that its upside will be capped? If we do that, will that developer try to develop a vaccine for some other loathsome disease?

There will remain incentives to not set the price too high. For example, an inevitable big customer will be the US government itself, buying for Medicare. The US government will press the successful developer for a reasonable price and, to get it, will dangle the prospect of a very large order. And guess what?

You do realize that a majority of drugs that have been developed, were developed at the expense of taxpayers. Take the newest HIV drugs, those were developed at the cost of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, since the government can’t own a patent, and doesn’t have the capacity to manufacture oral or injection drugs, they sell the drug to a pharmaceutical company that then manufactures and gouges the people of this country. Take the Hepatitis C drugs, an 8 week treatment is one pill a day, in this country the maker charges $20,000 dollars a month, in Europe its $7.00 a pill. Only the United States can pharmaceutical drug makers literally gouge patients, for drugs we the tax payer has already paid the R&D for. And you can’t just go to a gastroenterologist and be diagnosed with Hepatitis C and get a prescription, oh no. You and your Dr have to be “treatment naive” I’m not kidding, and my insurance company made me take 4 separate ultrasounds, one of which they refused to pay for, the one question I had was why didn’t you ask my Dr to order all 4 of these tests in one day, at one time.

I agree completely with your comment that the stock market needs to be controlled. Although corporations will continually require renewed funding, the source should be the bond market. Yes, bonds are publicly traded, but they have guaranteed interest payments, and are considerably more difficult to market. Stock share conversion to bonds is a straight forward process. Stock incentives as compensation would be eliminated, and as a result stock trading minimized, allowed only for settling estates. Although bond incentives could be allowed as compensation, the rules for amortization of bond premiums, would be a useful price control.

The how to do this is effective tax policy. We currently have S-Corporations, which are permitted limited ownership, Corporate profits and losses are passed directly to the S-Corporation’s shareholders as ordinary income, and the S-Corporations are not taxed. Large corporations should have a similar tax system, the difference being more internal disclosure.

It would do two things. Profiteering from stock sales would be eliminated, which is the immediate goal. We would also be able to put to bed the silly argument that corporations are people."

Others may eventually forget your actions, but i wonder - do you, can you, really ever forget how such vast amounts of money came to you?

So set up some minimally equipped lab, hire a few qualified researchers and then start randomly testing from random formulations . The minute something looks vaguely promising put out a press release.

If they choose wisely, stockholders profit.  Otherwise they take the lumps.  Instead, the federal government lavishes huge sums of taxpayer money to provide the bulk of the working capital and private shareholders provide a relatively small share of the total. The taxpayer takes all the risk.  If a company succeeds, the corporate insiders reap all the obscene profits and the taxpayer receives no return on their investment. If the company fails, they’ve lost no money and the taxpayers loose.  If that’s not bad enough, the companies and leeches (hedge fund and wealthy investors) are virtually exempt from paying any taxes and we are forced to pay outrageous prices on other drugs provided by Big Pharma.

While it's hard to make a distinction between the two: many, perhaps most, ""small-time criminals"" are driven by the reality that they have few other options whereas for the filthy-rich, money-grabbing is merely a clean addiction. I can understand how people can get drawn into some of the ridiculous conspiracy theories that abound: when the filthy-rich scramble to make more of what they don’t need because the less-advantaged desperately need something in order to to remain healthy, the mind starts doing some magical mathematics. 

This kind of greed, an addiction to push profits inordinately high simply because you can, is among the majority of reasons that everything involving healthcare is so inordinately expensive. There should be no profit connected to healthcare. Every aspect of it should be nonprofit. The money-grabbers would abandon it, but there will always be dedicated people willing to earn an honest living involved in research and development of drugs, therapies, and apparatus and eager to maintain healthy communities. One needs only look at organizations like Doctors Without Borders or Partners in Health if they don’t believe altruism is still a value to some.

Researchers tell us that the successful creation of vaccines isn't rocket science.  It's much harder than rocket science.  Everyday it seems that some firm has ""good news"" causing it's stock price to skyrocket.  While I live in New York I'm from Missouri on this one.  I'll believe it when I see it.

From the beginning, any president of the US and other leaders of bio-tech “wealthy” nations, should have said “we’ll pay research costs to companies willing to risk developing Covid vaccine  - and if/when one is developed, we’ll buy vaccine from those who took the chance - at 5 cents a dose above real gross manufacturing costs. With those small profits would come government protection from the dozen or so real cases of allergic or similar reactions to what has been tested and found safe.
The vaccine’s patent will be declared ‘owned’ by the nation, and available to any company capable of vaccine manufacturer, free of charge.
The developers wouldn’t lose, and have first shot at earning a five-cent-a-dose profit - along with immunity from garbage lawsuits companies with big profits often settle to avoid millions of dollars in legal fees.
And the thanks of a grateful world.
But no, funding this like the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bomb was out of the question.
Greed, withholding “proprietary information”, means a handful will make a killing, research will be slow because two companies may each have half the answer, but sharing is “socialism”, and many millions if not billions will die because they don’t have the $1,000  a dose to buy the cure.

2020-07-26 12:58:34,"There should be enough space in these vacant corporate towers -- after they are converted into affordable rental apartments -- to house tens of thousands of workers who would otherwise have to commute from the outer boroughs and suburbs.

The new tenants can either work at home or walk to the office, relieving pressure on public transportation, bridges/tunnels and parking. Traffic will diminish.

The food services and retail establishments needed to cater to these folks will return and should thrive.  Much street space can be turned into pedestrian malls, making life in midtown livable...even pleasant.

Public policy including real estate tax strategy, necessary subsidies, zoning regulations, and whatever else is required should be focused on making this a reality!!!!"
2020-07-26 12:59:07,"In 1975, the United Federation of Teachers was one of the unions which helped to bail out the city. We were proud to aid our city in its time of need and 5 years later we received checks to pay us back.
I'm afraid that those solutions are not going to work this time. We are in a different world now. Working from home is a game changer and we will just have to wait and see how it unfolds. Hopefully New Yorkers will rise to the occasion with their imaginative ""can do"" attitude!"
2020-07-26 13:01:22,"Same picture downtown. Last week I walked down Water Street from the Staten Island ferry terminal to the South St. Seaport and it was a ghost town, at 12:30 pm on a summer Wednesday afternoon. It’s like an alternate reality but this IS reality."
2020-07-26 13:01:24,"Pandora's box of working remotely has been opened and there is no shutting it. If New York landlords still demand New York rents when virtually all white collar workers can now work remotely, there is going to be a reckoning for this city, and this goes double if restaurants, venues, museums, etc. are still operating at reduced capacities, closing due to COVID-19 flare ups, etc. And I'm one of them, because I will go ""I no longer have to come in to the office, restaurants can seat 1/2 the people when open and and I hate waiting in lines so I almost never eat out anymore, my landlord just raised my rent $100 again and refuses to budge... welp, good luck, New York. I'm taking my presence and my taxes elsewhere.""

So if this plays out, if tons of white collar people like me clear out because we're not interested in paying obnoxious rent if we can't do anything, leaving only people whose jobs can't be done remotely and don't make as much... well, I'm sure a lot of NYC NY State government officials are losing sleep over this and how they will cope."

2020-07-26 13:07:51,"Maybe it’s time to rethink buildings like this as “vertical villages”, with mixed uses where people live, work, and play? Maybe the ground floor is Whole Foods and retail, floors 2-4 are entertainment or schools, floors 4-20 are work or work live spaces, floors 21-40 are residences, and the top most floors are a hotel or the Rainbow Room? In a pandemic world, vertical living could have significant benefits: no commute or subway, “Covid-pod” friendly, social distancing friendly, and less density on elevators. Unlike cruise ships, former work-only towers could be made far less dense, without shared air systems, making it a safer and convenient way to live in a city. Combine that with some of the ideas from the City Lab article about Manhattan streets and the most expensive real estate in the world really is worth it."
2020-07-26 13:08:03,"The article bears a chilling resemblance to post-apocalyptic novels such as the ""World Made by Hand"" series by James Howard Kunstler, and many others that have appeared in recent years.  The Golden Age of Science Fiction, produced by a previous generation of authors like Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, optimistically predicted a moral and social blossoming of humankind in the near future which has not come to pass.  Let's hope the current generation of pessimists are likewise inaccurate predictors."
2020-07-26 13:09:17,"The realization that Americans are no longer exceptional because they so can’t rouse enough empathy to wear a mask has been the most shocking realization for me.

2020-07-26 13:09:23,"I spent nearly 40 years working as a lawyer in Manhattan, mostly in Midtown. I semi-retired last year and moved upstate. Whatever wistful feelings I may have had about what I left behind -- the energy of midtown, the food trucks, eavesdropping in the elevator, last-minute lunch dates with friends -- is gone. I'm  happy as a clam and grateful for my luck in getting out when I did.  My friends who are still in the city are in a state of shock and very uncertain about the future. Optimism that it will all go back to normal is merely happy talk."
2020-07-26 13:09:33,"Although we may bemoan the lack of a ""scene"" going down in Midtown Manhattan in these buildings, it is somehow ironic we should mourn it.
After the Reagan 80's, corporate was allowed to go straight for the heart of the middle class, and has been a large part of it's destruction.
We should only feel warm and fuzzy if and when they return to something like they were in the 1950's and actually paid the average worker enough to live on.  Not now, when they have helped make the country utterly unstable.  Edifices are nice, it's what's going on underneath them that counts."
2020-07-26 13:09:35,"After spending time and money designing ""open workspaces"", will companies go back to the cubicle model for safety reasons?

2020-07-26 13:10:15,In all other eras NYC has come back.  But in all other eras white collar business couldn't be done 100% remotely. Now it can. Commercial real estate is going to collapse and it won't return to the same level for awhile. NYC will replay the 70s. That's just fact.
2020-07-26 13:10:24,"Working class adults below 55, of America has been suffering because of the business shut down. It is like the second hand smoke being worse than the smoke inhaled by a smoker or the remedy is worse than the disease. Unfortunately, many businesses will never open again for various reasons and the impact on working class will be long term no matter who will occupy the white house. We are unlikely to have similar lowest unemployment as we had once upon a time 5 months ago. 

The entire job situation is going to change business sectors thriving before are going to experience a seismic shift. Shopping in malls is going to be replaced by online shopping and warehouses are going to replace malls. Dining in will be replaced by dinning out outdoors. Yesterday for the first time in five months in dinned out with a loved one and while felt safe from COVID-19 infection, there were flies competing aggressively for the food when it was brought over. Flies can be the biggest spreader of Salmonella. Already there are 200 salmonella infections in the USA enough to spread faster than the speeding bullets. American way of life is becoming an unAmerican way of life. Those who have never run a business will never know how long it takes to establish a profitable business employing several people and what it takes to retain employees. Yesterday while sitting outdoors at a Mexican restaurant, I saw a Singaporean Chinese restaurant owner carrying boxes out. He said his employees want to eat Mexican."
2020-07-26 13:10:59,"I work in a big-box store and as such, I am an essential worker (in an essential business) and what we have noticed is that the stimulus ($1200) that was paid back in April and May and was meant for essentials like food, rent and prescriptions, seemed to be additional money for most people.  We had a huge surge in internet orders and in-store purchases (often breaking records) and so it appeared that the money was not as important as expected.  Most people seemed to treat it as found money,"
2020-07-26 13:11:32,"An omen.  Or not.  New York is not going away.  Nor is its vibrant economic, social, and cultural scene.

To argue that the slump that New York and many other places are experiencing is an omen of a dystopian future is the kind of awfulism that always sells in times of trouble."
2020-07-26 13:11:52,"In the early days of the pandemic the mantra was that the freedom and flexibility of working at home was great. Now I’m getting a sense that it’s boring, listless. Just reading the article made me conscious of the energy that’s missing now. 

Humans are for the most part social creatures. Those that flock to large cities especially so. I’m confident we will be back there."
2020-07-26 13:13:07,"BUT it is different this time - Why?

1- In the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 00s working from home was basically impossible. 

2- During the past 2 decades rampant Greed has resulted in - 
     Corporate executives addicted to cost cutting so they can earn personally earn $millions more a year.
     Landlords building newer more expensive commercial and residential real estate with punishing rents.
      An explosion of growing vagrants imbedded in Manhattan.

Requiring a vast consumption of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting, our skyscrapers leave huge carbon footprints and other ecological damage; the metaphorical ""thriving ecosystem"" of commerce described in this article's first line is predicated on the vast destruction of Nature's real ecosystems around the globe. Perhaps the coronavirus is doing humanity a favor -- showing us a preview of our possible future.

2020-07-26 13:15:53,"Living in PA with many friends with kids and their families in the NYC region, the perception seems to be that social distancing will now become the norm and in order to do that effectively, you have to get out of densely populated cities.  So, the flight to the suburbs may be starting. If so, NYC will gradually have more and more permanently half filled buildings which, in turn, could lead to the general decay of the city."
2020-07-26 13:19:49,"The pandemic has left NYC and in particular Manhattan bleak, desolate, and almost devoid of life and the activity of a thriving metropolis. It is a landscape of an economic depression worse than that of the 1930s. That a simple viral pandemic could cause such devastation to our city and its purpose and its way of life is astonishing. It seems to illustrate the precariousness of civilization and even human existence. How NYC is going to recover is beyond my imagination?  But if it doesn’t,  I cannot conceive of our country ever being affluent, successful and worth emulating again."

2020-07-26 13:23:08,"As a young Midtown office worker in Dinkins' NYC, popping in and out of the numerous corporate cafeterias housed in the basements (and sometimes high upper floors) of those 6th and 5th Ave. high rises was how lunch was affordable and interesting.  9/11 and ID checks ended that mobility between office buildings, and in my mind changed greatly what working in Midtown had been.  Seems like the Covid changes are more dramatic than the ones wrought by 9/11."
2020-07-26 13:29:46,"I hope there’s a good chance things return to whatever normal can be. This obsession with working from home, as if it’s some kind of panacea, will likely be short lived. The comparison is the people who initially welcomed the full time presence with their kids. They are now clamoring for someone, anyone to release them from this purgatory. 
Diversity is still the spice of life, it’s why retirement can be problematic and being on vacation ceases to be vacation if it’s a constant state of existence.

I found Mr. Luskin’s initial fear of the holiday’s at Rockefeller Center, then his enjoyment of it nice. I wonder will there be a tree this year? If people can’t visit what’s the point? Or put another way, if the tree at 30 Rock falls on the rink, will it make a sound if no one hears it?"
2020-07-26 13:30:42,"We've obviously done a terrible job on all the detailed mechanics of getting the virus under control, and midtown is another casualty. Once infection rates come way down, through rapid and effective testing and contact tracing or a vaccine, midtown will come back, driven by the same forces. Hopefully, we'll take a break from partisan finger-pointing to clean up our shambles of a public-health system, so that this meltdown doesn't happen again. Incidentally, the miserable commute and crowded streets weren't a joy for those who worked there; a dialed-back experience wouldn't be a bad thing."
2020-07-26 13:35:29,"I left 2 weeks ago. Homeless and drug addicts on every corner in midtown. They’ve gotten increasingly aggressive. Me and my 5 year old got cursed out by a man on our move out day. You see it and you want to help. You do in many ways but there are so many desperate, out in the open that I could no longer feel the weight each day. Sounds selfish but I could no longer find the mental space for the city’s grief and keep a job beholden to the news cycle that I left for greener pastures."
2020-07-26 13:37:04,"It's common to look at working remotely from the perspective of the employee.  But what about the employer?  They are seeing a work force that is increasing the number of hours worked each day (they are certainly reviewing at those statistics) and they have visions of reducing their real estate footprint.  I don't think office life will return to anything resembling what we had this February.  I do agree however that New York will get through this, as it always does."

Even cultural exchange flourishes on the Internet (although I would argue not nearly as richly). 

What is the future of a city outside of a cultural preeminence or lifestyle choice? For the first time since the agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago, we can maybd begin to wonder ""Why do we need cities anymore at all?"""

We first moved into  ""newly"" POSH  East 52nd Street, which had been the epicenter of the ""Red Light District.""  By the 1970's  I was in an office on run-down West 57th Street.

Also, in the '70s we moved to East 22nd Street near the 13th Police Precinct so we could get a little protection from the rampant street crime. We moved our office to 17th St. (on the north side of Union Square Park) It was cheaper there because you had to face the guns and drugs that were omnipresent in the Park.

Virtually everyone we knew moved out of town by the end of the '70s.  You know, before most of the hot-shot places the article refers to existed in their present form.

We are people of means we pay a lot of taxes and are Democrats but old school Democrats who feel the city has abandoned us. We are mocked as old white men who are somehow the cause of all problems and most of have decided to pack it in and move. Who will feel the loss not us ,we will gain financially, it is the city who will lose by driving away our tax dollars, our philanthropy and volunteer hours ,the loss of of our job creation. This new political social democratic group of politicians will not have the will to make the tough decisions on crime and budget needed to right the ship and save our city. It is a shame because it took almost 30 years to bring this back and only 6 to drive to ruin. I will miss the bagels though"
2020-07-26 14:02:29,"I see why Mr. Stern says the Time and Life building celebrates itself by being set back from the street and why he doesn’t like it however part of the reason the building is set back from the street is to compensate for the lack of “stepping back” of the upper floors to allow for sunlight. This was a new allowance fought for in building codes oringinally by Mies van der Rohe with his Seagrams building I believe. 

I’ve worked in midtown for over 20 years. I think the ghost town that it is now will be short term. I must say though overall I don’t miss it. There’s something wrong with an environment that has to compensate the soullessness of it all with little plazas and fountains, unreachable steakhouses, cafeterias, and now game rooms, nap rooms and other perks. 

My office has reopened with crazy guidelines. They gave employees the power of choice. We could go in if we wanted to and so far only a handful has."

I’m honestly not sure how long it will take for  things to go back to the same way. A lot of offices are designed as open floor seating to fit as many people as possible. For me to go into the city, I would have to take a packed New Jersey Transit train, go up the stairs of Penn Station with thousands of commuters, walk to Rock in crowded street , go up the packed elevator, work in an absolutely packed office, go down to get lunch where the streets are packed and then go home.

The buildings, while majestic on the outside, were ugly on the inside.  Packed elevators, windows that didn't open, gray cubicles, and gray carpet - and you never had time to get lunch (because of the packed elevators).  Perhaps if you were the top of the food chain this was glamorous but the rest of us felt like gerbils in a cage."

Your society seems to be operating and functioning on a hyper-local level and your citizens are in survival mode. Patriotism about what exactly?
2020-07-26 14:09:31,"Hopefully soon all these empty buildings will be turned into affordable housing with artist lofts, schools and healthy affordable restaurants.  

New York City, like every other city with massive amounts of pricy office space is about to go through a massive shake out.  

No matter how many real estate execs say people will come back to their offices.  Fact is most office workers and their employers are benefiting financially and with new found personal time from ditching the office and its commute.  

Why spend so much fossil energy going from one place to another when one can use their computer at home?  Not to mention all the now pointless office apparel which is mostly made of Oil and even if not, apparel is 2nd to oil as leaving the biggest yearly Carbon foot print.

Corporations can be great without offices in big buildings.  And NYC can also be great without the corporations.  We will need to do more with less money.  But no reason to let the big buildings go to waste...move the artists in and NYC will thrive as the real estate moguls empire crumble."

I'm so sorry about all this.  But i guess if we continue to increase the human  population of the planet, to maybe 20 billion humans or double or triple  that, maybe eating animals is not the best idea for us."

The views from atop were spectacular-  it looked like a pop-up card of shiny metal, glass & twinkling lights at night. I like you could reach out & touch the city. I imagine that there’s a lot less twinkling at the moment, but the sheer magnitude of what that architecture represents remains. Simply breathtaking. Yes, New York has and will continue to change. That’s in part where it draws its energy - things in flux. But those buildings will remain - empty or not - to remind us to look up."
2020-07-26 14:23:12,"The problem is that in previous panics we didn’t have the technology to make it viable for large numbers of people to work separately and away from the corporate office. Today we do, if you’ll forgive the occasional WiFi slowdown or outage as you work from your bedroom, kitchen or wherever else. Midtown Manhattan capitalized on the real need for everyone to be together in a shared space. The longer the pandemic goes on and the longer that workarounds are found to make remote working more viable for more people, the less there is a real need for shared space. Unfortunately there will also be less of a need for hot dog trucks."

When everything gets back to normal, some of those buildings on Sixth Avenue, as well as all over the city will still be partially empty.

This feels different, and not in a good way.  A Stuyvesant Town resident I'm witnessing an exodus that's startling.

Parking lots that were at capacity with waitlists are emptying.

Of course eventually things will turn around, but let's be honest.  This pandemic is here for a few years, and in that time people will have less and less desire to be with large groups of people, which is the very nature of cities, and especially NYC.

Between a fascist leaning administration and a pandemic that's been completely ignored on federal level, I'm grateful I'm a dual EU/US citizen (thanks UK mom!) and am considering leaving the country, especially if he wins or steals the election.

I hate at 64 that's where things are for me and my husband, but, there it is.  He's also an EU passport holder so we are luckier than most.

2020-07-26 14:38:17,"I worked mostly at home for a decade, and then moved to a job where being in the office was required. I found that working remotely was most successful when you had pre-existing relationships with people, and everyone or nearly everyone was remote. It doesn’t work well when half the people are in one room, and everyone else is in different virtual windows — the people at home were left out. 

The pre-existing relationships were so important. If we’d met a few times, and gotten to know each other a bit, it was far easier to work remotely. But, this doesn’t last as people move on, new people start, and you don’t know each other. 

I was concerned about being in an office full time, but found a nice trade off. There are lots of offices, conference rooms, and the cubes are large with walls. None of this sitting at a bench, open office, find a space every day nonsense. Seems fair, if you want me there every day, give me a nice space to sit.

Although we have offices in midtown, I happen to work at a very large office in CT.  That works great, as we have the NYC presence, easy to reach, but most of us work daily in the larger, suburban office. I think we will see smaller offices in large cities, satellites in nearby suburbs, supplemented with some work from home."
2020-07-26 14:42:08,"Let’s chill, not every story has to be about the have and have nots. Surprise! There are inequities in the world and whenever you enjoy a piece of fine art or go to a broadway show, symphony or opera, you should acknowledge that sometimes other people’s wealth actually benefits all of society. Personally, I choose equality over liberty, which I believe are two concepts generally at odds with each other.  But I digress.  This article is about midtown Manhattan and it’s inhabitants and a certain lifestyle that many of us, including moi in the early 90s, enjoyed.  I didn’t love my job but I loved taking the E to my W 57th street office with a view of the Park. I loved walking down to St Patrick’s on 5th, (fortunately, the hideous T Tower was avoidable!) and, of course, the Tree during the holidays.  I know life isn’t fair and I eventually chose to leave myself as the money wasn’t worth the hours, but I’m glad some people are willing to work those hours because I still love walking those streets."
2020-07-26 14:42:38,"What is happening to Manhattan is so sad.  I lived through the late 70s, early 80s and 9/11 but this is different.  Quality of life suffered in the early 80s and business downtown and people were affected after 9/11 but nothing comparable to what is now happening.  There is a total shift now in how businesses will structure their work environment, and the workforce largely made up of millenials, will more likely embrace this change as a great opportunity to work from home.  But for us old timers, whose lives unconsciously were woven around casual encounters on subway trains, greetings with the coffee cart man, a sloppy falaffel sandwich from the cart and yes, even dealing with office politics, this seems like the end of era.  So sad."

I love my city (adopted; I moved here from Massachusetts as a young adult employed in a low paying office job and soaking up everything the City had to offer, which surpassed the learning I experienced in college) the way Walt Whitman did. It’s not high rises and tourist sites that make Manhattan - it’s the people and the life on the streets and indoor places. This story makes my heart ache. But I would never leave and I won’t give up on New York."
2020-07-26 14:47:00,"This moment could be a blessing in disguise, if we can just see it that way.

Maybe it's time to reimagine New York. There are many brilliant minds in academia, think tanks and not for profit policy organizations that could help us initiate this process.

The idea of the corporate office of yesterday is over. It won't disappear, but we know it will be substantially reduced.

Just as manufacturing moved from small backyard coal shops to the modern industrial floor, the same is happening in business. The question is will we control and direct this change or simply allow it to envelop us?

This may be a chance to revitalize neighborhoods and decentralize many commercial functions. The outer boroughs could take on a new role. Music and art could be decentralized as well.

This will not be an easy transition. But it is just the beginning of the unavoidable imperative to meet the reality of the climate catastrophe we have produced that will force the closing of much of lower Manhattan.

The CoV-2 epidemic is an early warning. Start the process of change now or reap the results of our arrogance. 

No better pace to begin than midtown Manhattan."

A positive effect of the current crisis is that it has shown that the vast majority of what have traditionally been known as ""office workers"" can do their jobs just as efficiently and productively--and much more comfortably--from home, and that allowing workers to work from home provides massive benefits to qualify of life.

We should be embracing the work from home revolution as a permanent shift, not rushing to go back to the office just because it may be ""safe."""

Employees will essentially make reservations to enter the building, with a computer rejecting new arrivals after the maximum number is reached.""

At some point this year or next year, the virus will either have run through enough people so that it won’t have enough people to infect and spread or there will be a vaccine. A couple of years seems a long time in a human life but it’s a blip in the life of a city."
2020-07-26 14:55:13,"Big city downtowns are so last century. Their entire reason for being was the aggregation of workers for efficiency. But even that was an illusion. The attention and time of the workforce is consumed with transportation to, from and within the high rise buildings. Coffee breaks and lunchtime are stretched by congestion and distraction. Employees and managers start looking at their watches mid afternoon, counting down till cocktail hour. 

The internet changed everything and exposed the inefficiencies of working downtown. Three hours a day on subways and highways are magically recouped and replaced by cooking, TV and, for better or worse, more family time. Watercooler gossip is now Facebook. Close in living lose their purpose. Tiny cramped overpriced big city apartments that drive their tenants out every evening in search of nightlife, yield to suburban apartments with twice the space at half the rent. Cramped tiny stores which pass  their astronomical overhead to the consumer are replaced by suburban supermarkets with wide aisles, low prices, greater variety and free parking. 

Trends wax and wane. Change triggers fear and anxiety. People thought they could never live without the bustling, cacophonous central business districts. They're finding out they can, and that it is quite pleasant once you get used to it."

I  was there when the news of JFK's murder came across  the wire at 1 p.m. and for the next days, all of NYC was in mourning.

Then there were the huge drinks at La Fonda on the first floor and the many nearby restaurants where you could eat decent French food for less than $2.00

I’ve been to thriving, bustling modern-day Hiroshima and know that cities eventually bounce back from far, far worse than this. And just maybe, hopefully, NYC will never again be what it was becoming in 2019 but will ultimately find itself renewed, revitalized. It seems to me a place with so much soul, but a city which has, over recent decades, become constricted, abused and neglected by the disconnected rich. I would love to see it become again a place that is less wealthy and more welcoming to a wider swath of humanity. Maybe it would be great if the CEOs and chain stores stayed away, rents were lowered and more diversity of local small business began to flower again?

2020-07-26 12:50:05,"This midtown disaster is entirely predictable.

Simple math:  8000 people working in a building, trying to get to their desks on floor X.  If they can only ride 4 to an elevator, that means 2000 elevator trips.  There are how many elevators in the building? 
<a href=""https://www.1271aoa.com/you/specifications.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.1271aoa.com/you/specifications.html</a>
Vertical Transportation
    30 passenger elevators
    2 private elevators between the 46th and 48th floors
    3 freight elevators (6,000 pound capacity and 14’ maximum height)
    4 escalators

30?  That implies 67 cycles just to get everyone into the building.  If a cycle lasts 1 minute, that is 1 hour to fill the building.  Add another 1 hour to empty the building.

If you are first in, and first out, you get about 7 hours at your desk, max, unless you stay late or come in early.

Lunch?  Fuggedaboutit. 

Leaving for lunch would be another horror show.
 ""Lunch"" happens when you leave for the day and do not come back.

I suppose you could operate the building at one quarter capacity, to provide social distancing.  That cuts the time to fill and empty to only 15 minutes.  Going to lunch might even be possible.

So now that we solved all of those those problems, let me ask you one question: 

Do YOU want to work every day in a building when you have to rebreathe the air for a whole working day, because none of the windows can be opened?"

Well...the threat after 9-11 was seen as external to the building. It was of course irrational, but nonetheless it felt real. 

The threat now are the very occupants inside the buildings, and the likely poor, under-performing, in many outright filthy ventilation systems in these older buildings.

The fears were never someone standing shoulder to shoulder to you, in the next cubicle, the ones returning from a few days off, exposed to more people then usual. The not yet wiped knobs and railings, cabinet pulls...phones, copy machines. The very air around you.

Covid tosses an extremely hot potato into everyone's hands, and no one wants to take it from you.

Biederman; ""So it will survive. But each time, each one of those moments probably can be traced in relationship to new ideas on how to occupy existing buildings or how to occupy new buildings.”

Really? How exactly did we occupy buildings differently? Companies might have added little perks, and quirks - especially the dot-com's...with their adult playrooms, and  al-fresco desks and meeting room spaces. But they still packed them in and wanted close contact and interaction.

To the present observer, repurposing empty (though structurally sound) office buildings as residential accommodation - an option that was mentioned in the article - does make a lot of sense, while deciding what to do with other now obsolete buildings (including deciding whether and when to demolish them), given the no doubt irreversible effects of the pandemic, which call for something other than a 'return to business as it was'."
2020-07-26 15:27:43,"The best way to predict the future is to not do it, because it is unpredictable for the most part. Journalists need to realize their words count a Lot in many minds. 
    A good distraction is the Movie Andromeda Strain. When the electronic microscope turned off the virus quit replicating. 
         We have an instance of that yesterday with accidental shooting in Louisville, it got scant reporting on many news outlets. Yet the public is feeding on news of police riots in Portland and Seattle.  
     Any organization knows it lives or dies with the notoriety of being in the news. Someday free society such as ours will have to take in mind what matters most with what we ingest for knowledge of the world. 
  A decent analogy of this pandemic in force and recovery may be Gulf Coast towns and cities years after hurricanes. Those with deep pockets and fortitude thrive. The weak wither. Sometimes a town is a mix. 
   Our market based economy shows well the lesser incantation of The Golden Rule. Hopefully revival will favor the spiritual version."
2020-07-26 15:31:34,"This is causing  or will  possibly cause a paradigm shift in the thinking people of this planet. In some sense we've been living in the same world that created the industrial revolution (IR), only with electricity.

Now, we're all in the same boat and while the nations leaders are still playing the power game, maybe its time to look to a more unified, sharing planet, aware of the damage we've caused which will exacerbate greater migrations and  socio-economic and political stresses (see recent NYT article for one example). 

If history is any example, my hope for a positive solution where the well being of all is taken into account, is not too high. 

That stated, by paradigm shift from the IR and the old economic order possibly to... never mind. The European Union was an example of the attempt. The Silk Road is yet another but it plays to Chinese hegemony. The US and the West has had that economic hegemony rent asunder since WWI and more so since the end of WWII.  Now not quite everyone is in the game, of manufacturing, shipping, interlocking trade though many are. 

The old order sees the past through some sort of rose colored glasses in every country. Here we have the southern history, and white supremacy, China has its 3000+ plus years of history. The mid east is a hodgepodge of history much of it tied to Abrahamic legitimacy and  what I would call family infighting further heightened by European and American interference and resource requirements.

Out of room oops."
2020-07-26 15:31:34,"I worked in Manhattan for several years, including a stint at Baruch College CUNY, on the East Side in the 20s.  There was no sense of a campus or much interaction between the students and faculty.  My classroom was on the 10th floor, my office on the 20th floor of a high rise near the Metropolitan Life building.  The lines for the elevators were so long with students trying to get to classes on time, I always took the stairs.  I do not miss that environment at all."

2020-07-26 15:50:35,"The essential core of NYC is success over obstacles. To survive the city must be re-envisioning with respect for nature: land, green space, shore, people, and animals. It must be very different or it will die."
2020-07-26 15:54:10,"New York is already on its way back to being a city fully inhabited and alive with possibilities. The corporate office, however, is over. It was already becoming a relic of the past before COVID, the pandemic simply sped up the time line. Every person working from home these past four months will continue to work from home until at least 2021 and by then no one will want to return to an office ever again. These landlords will need to repurpose their buildings and, horror, substantially lower the rent for the small number of companies that might need some office space."
2020-07-26 15:54:21,"I am so sorry that NYC midtown is having such a problem. It is really not just midtown however as people from all over NYC and the country are reluctant to get exposed to Covid-19. I do not think things will improve much until a workable vaccine is introduced and actually taken by most of the USA population. I have not been out to dine since the restaurants were initially  closed and probably will not go out to dine even as restaurants open until a vaccine is introduced. I am elderly and have a compromised immune system. I do think people can go back to work safely because during this whole pandemic there were over 50 million ""essential"" workers out there every day without creating a catastrophic death rate amongst them. The used PPE and it worked out fine as far as I know. I think the same applies to schools which I think should re-open if the proper safety precautions are diligently implemented."
2020-07-26 15:55:49,"As someone who works at a food service location at exactly this spot, and was furloughed earlier than most, I can only say that the main issue here is not workers, but tourists.  Along with Times Square just a few blocks away, this area is among the largest tourist meccas around.  Radio City, shopping, food and, of course, ""Broadway.""

With the shutting down of indoor dining (and, in this area, even outdoor dining) and the entertainment industry (clubs and other ""hangouts""), there is zero tourist activity.  Even if every worker returned to their offices, the area would still be only half or less what it usually is.  And while the business I work for has been open for take-out and delivery - and now has a skeletal counter staff for the few people who come in each day - I am unlikely to be able to return to work unless and until the tourists return.

I am obviously both saddened and frightened by this - I can barely survive on unemployment and PUA, and now the GOP wants to take away the PUA - but I do understand why it was done, and actually appreciate how careful Gov. Cuomo and Mayor DeBlasio are being about re-opening.  If they were to re-open like so many other cities and States, without careful planning, NYC would very soon re-emerge as an epicenter of the virus.  I would much rather wait and be sure that when I do return to work (I am a 60-year-old man with an underlying condition), I will be as safe as possible."
2020-07-26 15:55:51,"NYC does not have a health care system that 
can handle a public health emergency.

During HIV we had a crisis very similar to Covid.

Patients not getting adequate treatment because there are no beds and the hospitals are staffed by inexperienced inters and resident.  Death rate way to high.  At one point 80% of ventilated patients died.  This is not an acceptable outcome.  I work at a hospital where every ventilated patient had a private ICU bed and their own state of the art ventilator and the personal attention of a team of trained intensivists.  We had a death rate < 10%

Why are people going to want to live in a densely populated city that doesn’t have the health care infrastructure to handle a pandemic or any large scale disaster.

In addition, the things that draw people to NYC, the restaurants—gone, cultural events—gone, places of work—leaving."
2020-07-26 16:00:07,"Covid 19 is catalyzing the long overdue contraction of office-located work.  It has been technically possible for many office-type jobs to be performed more efficiently by telecommuting workers for at least a decade.  This change will not reverse, but only continue.  At the same time some limited categories of work will be found to require physical presence, thus a contraction of office-located work but not its entire elimination.  The overhang of existing office buildings is likely to transform to residences, perhaps for the elderly baby boom for whom proximity to relevant services may prove vital."

The situation was dysfunctional and awful back then. As someone who has worked in midtown for many years, I  have to say that if I never have to return to working there again, I would be thrilled."
2020-07-26 16:28:01,"April, 2000: Concluding a day tour of NYC, I stood at the corner of 7th and 34th for an hour and tried to process the  impressions from all I had seen. I felt the surging energy of the activity around, above and below me. It was a stunning display of concentrated wealth, power and interdependent complexities. 

But afterward, upon further reflection, I was startled  by a sense that in the magnitude of its energetic achievements, that metroplex is increasingly fragile. 

It is a lesson in physics. Every dynamic system is subject to the process called entropy which is the expenditure of its energy reserves. Humans have learned many incautious ways to accelerate that process with dramatic results. Ultimately, it's like a fireworks show; when the flash and bang are over, all that's left is cold debris scattered in the darkness. 

But that's hard science, too seldom persuasive against people's' preference for easy delusion. We've gotten away with it for a while, but our children's chances are at deepening risk."

2020-07-26 16:35:02,"I moved from Manhattan (after dropping out of Columbia) to Seattle in 1972, when the Boeing Bust had decimated the economy. After Gotham on a student budget, Seattle seemed like paradise. A city of beautiful old homes and tight-knit neighborhoods, with many houses I could afford to rent just working a part-time job while going to the University of Washington, where tuition ran $166 per quarter. Friends just a few years older were able to buy lovely houses for back taxes. The old Smith Tower was still one of the only tall buildings in town. A bunch of us rented a waterfront cottage on Lake Sammamish for $150 a month. A farmhouse in Woodinville with some acreage, ditto.

Laid-off Boeing workers became bakers, potters, organic farmers, opened small restaurants. They went to the UW to study botany or music or Sanskrit and spent lots of time hanging out at the Allegro or one of the many little espresso places that sprang up all over town.

In the Seattle of today, the Craftsman bungalows in Wallingford and Ravenna where I lived are now $1.5 to $2 million. Downtown is a forest of highrise offices and condos, including Manhattan-style luxury buildings with units $2 million and up. I can’t even find the farmhouse - it’s somewhere plowed under one of the office parks, faux chateaux, sprawling condo complexes, freeways in Woodinville. Lake Union is Amazon Country, condos and tiny $3500 a month studios in sterile new buildings.

If it has to, Manhattan can regroup too."
2020-07-26 16:45:57,"BRING IN THE ARTISTS! 

So many of us are still in need of studio space in which we can work in solitude. For decades we've been driven out of Manhattan by crazy rent for unventilated, no-daylight shoeboxes. There are very few organizations that provide space.  Office workers may be reluctant to go back to an open space office with many other workers but for many visual artists who spend their time alone in their studio, the risk of riding the subway and riding the elevator is worth it, if they get a room to work in.

Artists regenerated Soho, Dumbo and other parts of the city. Let's not wait a decade or two before we bring them in again."
2020-07-26 16:49:12,Its baffling to understand how the political establishment in New York and somewhat the media fails to report on the most devastating blow to the city in history.  They are truly whistling in the dark.  Much of what made New York is now history.  Office buildings are obsolete and dangerous.  Without tax revenue the city will soon declare bankruptcy.  Don't worry about defunding the police.  Soon the firemen and school teachers will not have funding as little revenue will not cover the cost of running the city. Our government leaders are painting an untrue picture of the future.  Most New Yorkers saw this and the ones that could afford to have left. The thousands working from home will not return in the future.  This is the sad truth.
2020-07-26 16:51:53,"The current state of things are dark indeed, but parts of it will recover once a vaccine is available, for the same social and financial dynamics that brought so many people together here in the first place, or cramped together on an office floor.

But much will unquestionably be lost that may not be replaced, not easily.  The economic cost to individuals, institutions and the nation is staggering, and we still have months to go even assuming one of the current vaccine candidates will succeed. 

Some will choose never to return, because yes, there will be another pandemic, due to global warming, and increasing human-nature interactions resulting from habitat loss and overpopulation, if nothing else. But it will not be a bad thing to have some businesses and people relocate, if they so choose, to other parts of the city or the country, spread the wealth and power around and reduce the pressure on the city (not to mention its extravagant real
estate prices)

I’d like to think we’d be better prepared for the next one, but seeing how poorly many of continue to fare in this one, whether by circumstance or by choice, I am not really optimistic.

So as with every time NYC has faced a severe crisis and predictions of abandonment, I see more of a natural cycle of ebb and flow, regulating the excesses."
2020-07-26 16:54:33,"As has been the case for hundreds of years through the last pandemic and two world wars, New York will find a way to survive.  It will be painful and it will involve a great deal of change, but it it will eventually happen.  Nothing significant will happen here or in any major city of the world until there is a vaccine for COVID-19.  People are still still dying both in the US and around the world.  We cannot think that NYC's streets will fill up with work residents and tourists until their lives are no longer at risk from this deadly disease."
2020-07-26 14:36:02,"I worked at the McGraw Hill building right next to the then Time Life building and stayed at the Executive plaza on 51st.

The pandemic hasn’t so much changed things as much as it has accelerated the evolution of the inevitable. And New York will be the nexus of this future, but it will be  changed in ways we as yet cannot remotely anticipate."

An email sent last week said they decided to immediately leave the current unoccupied building. Lord knows how much they're saving on rent from now until when it's safe for workers to re-enter an office building. But the big question is why return at all? Must thousands of employees need to be onsite to work productively?Since March, it's clear that they don't, so what's the point of plunking down millions on Midtown Manhattan rents? Then there's this issue: if it's unsafe for more than four people to use an elevator, then why would anyone get on the subway?"

It was a thriving area, sometimes going out for lunch was a major ordeal as most restaurants where filled to capacity. Every once and awhile my wife would meet me for dinner at The Capital Grill mentioned in the article. The Pandemic has not only affected this area of the city, but every neighborhood. It makes me so sad because I Love New York, it has been my home for 75 years. I hope, and yes pray ..... that within time the entire city and the boroughs recover as soon as it is safe to do so."

2020-07-26 13:17:30,"The old Time Life building and its adjoining environment are quintessential to New York's corporate culture.  The characters of Mad Men would love to be there, forever.  But nothing is really forever.  What is most important about this central business district is that its tenants are absolutely critical to New York City's budget.  As it is, even with onerous taxes,  the city can't fund all the infrastructure that it needs to sustain a city of 8.5 million people.  Takeaway the Midtown corporate culture and it enormous revenue and tax generating corporations and the City is in pretty dire shape.  

This area can certainly be repurposed, as the article suggests, but New York needs those high priced hotels, executive suites and steakhouses and all the property and income taxes that these people.  We now know that the world can be run quite efficiently through Zoom conferences and the global internet.  Embracing this concept however, threatens the very viability of central cities everywhere and in point of fact the huge urban areas they are part of.  Not sure if I like this future."

I would make precisely the opposite argument - that staying home and doing everything humanly possible to not facilitate the transmission of COVID-19, and doing it for as long as necessary - is by definition the best thing we can do for our country, as staying away from each other is the only hope we have right now.

2020-07-26 17:17:21,"So many comments about waiting for a vaccine; the truth is at best a vaccine will have efficacy between 30-50% (even that would be astounding for a relatively unstable RNA virus). Not to scoff at that number; but this isn’t a small pox vaccine. You’ll still be more likely to become infected if exposed than not, if you’ve received a vaccine.
And many will be uncomfortable with taking a vaccine rushed to market, which is a reasonable decision, especially for an illness which isn’t severe for the vast majority. And certainly those who have recovered won’t want to expose themselves, which, by the time a vaccine is developed, manufactured, distributed, and deployed will be many indeed. 
I continue to believe that a vaccine is somewhat of a red herring; it may never exist, it may not be efficacious, it may have unexpected consequences, a large portion of the population may make a decision not to take it, and it may simply arrive too late for anyone to really care, much like the H1N1 vaccine. 
Decisions on how to live your life should be based on concrete facts, not long shots with innumerable conditions."

In early March I could still hear the trains running at night.  Now once in a while the sound of a train punctuates the night.  Once planes constantly flew overhead.  Now the sound or sight of one is almost startling.  Early on watching the empty trains pass me on walks I almost cried.  The train operators continued their empty runs.  The trains adhered to a schedule.  All part of an ecosystem carefully planned to make it all work.  People performing their jobs to make it all work for us.  I am beyond sad for everyone whose lives have been upended or lost their jobs. It didn’t have to be this way.  I’m native New Yorker who loves the City and want it back.

2020-07-26 17:43:23,"I will definitely mourn the loss of that part of Midtown, moreso than most other parts of Manhattan, if it can’t return to its former self, or a close facsimile of its former self. 

The stretch of Ave of Amer from 42d St. to 57th is definitely my favorite part of Midtown, and I love that so many of the buildings ARE set back, with plazas in front for sitting, etc.

When I first moved to NYC, toward the end of the 1970s, Sixth Ave. (Yes, I went there!) was like a NY wonder for me. I was actually awestruck by the company/corporations that inhabited it: CBS, wow! ABC, wow! (Before it moved), NBC and Radio City, wow! Time, wow! etc., etc. Coming from a small city, that stuff was really cool to see. I’ve actually been fortunate to have worked in some of those same buildings.

A lot has changed on that stretch of the avenue since then, and though I haven’t been over there since COVID-19 sent most people home, I hope that it will once again become a lively, booming Mecca for residents and tourists."

It will, again. 
It has been around ten years since I left New York City but I still miss it everyday."
2020-07-26 17:57:30,"The city has to think about how to get as many people back into Manhattan as soon as safely possible. How they get there is secondary. There are many that were hoping to implement congestion pricing in NYC, claiming it would raise funds for the MTA. While I personally feels it is regressive and intended to keep the less wealthy residents of the outer boroughs away from the new luxury towers, the time has some to scrap the idea completely. It is completely understandable that people will be hesitant to use mass transit for a while and may choose to drive in. The city should be ok with it of it means activity picks up again. While it may not be ideal for the MTA, the choice is building the city's tax revenue base should be a priority with hopes that the Federal government will one day bail out the MTA."

Something will come (maybe 'back') but the natural need for socialization will bring many people back to office buildings. Will they be the same? Probably not. I suspect that many who say they like working from home are just enamored by the uniqueness of it. Eventually, there will be the working conditions where people show up 'at work' two or three days a week. Remember how long it took to create the current environment - decades. The forthcoming changes will be highlighted by the technological changes  of the past decade or so. It will be different, but business will survive.

But, as the articles always meekly point out toward the end, cities have endured pandemics, and worse, for millennia. I'm baffled by all these articles claiming people will continue working remotely from their suburban homes forever. Who wants that? Who's enjoying working from home right now? Who prefers sitting in their living room on a Zoom call to taking the subway - with all its crowds and stench and annoyances - back into the heart of the city, back into the midst of all that energy and life. Maybe a handful of agoraphobes, but the rest of society will return, much in its earlier form, as soon as a medical solution has been found, whatever that might mean."
2020-07-26 18:43:05,"What covid has done is simply proven that much of the work done in those highrise office buildings can be done anywhere with a reliable internet connection. The cost of doing business can be greatly reduced by limiting the office space required. Employees no longer have to pay the costs, in time and money, to travel there, buy lunch out and update a wardrobe seasonally. A few more years into the digital age would have made this obvious anyway.

Cities will simply evolve, probably by mixing residential spaces into the existing commercial  centers. Commercial offices will become a home base housing activities that are better done in a communal setting. Working for a completely virtual company, I  know those functions are limited, if any exist at all. Change has always been and will always be the only constant in life. This change has just happened much faster than expected but it was inevitable."

The problem is Trump is trying to distract us from these issues by creating confrontation and division in places like Portland by sending Storm Troopers, without identification in fatigues to gas Mums ,Veterans , innocent people. 
I believe Joe Biden and his team have solutions to our problems that are worthy of debate and continuous improvement.
One thought is that Biden holds daily briefings , “ Breakfast with Joe” , he expands on his plans and invites questions from the Public. As he announces his VP pick , he should name a shadow Cabinet , including President Obama as his chief advisor. 
This team should expound upon these solutions.
No debates with Trump unless he releases his tax returns so there is total transparency , level playing field .

Companies love everyone working from home--no massive electric bill, they don't have to buy office supplies, they don't have to worry about keeping up computers or office equipment, which of course means no expensive maintenance contracts for copiers.  No phone bill (Hey, we can furlough all the receptionists and mailroom people!).  They can zone out large blocks of office space from having to heat or cool.  Switch office cleaning services to once a week or get rid of cleaning services altogether.  With cloud-based enterprise server options from companies like Dropbox, I.T. doesn't have to worry about maintaining peripherals or software updates.  Just leave that up to the WFH folks who are fairly adept at maintaining their own machines.  Make employees pay for all the infrastructure, without ever giving their employees a few extra bucks for running things.  What's a sick day anymore?  Stay at home, wheeze and continue working.  Heck, we'll never know you had a mild bout of COVID-19 that you're too embarrassed to tell the rest of your coworkers.

Just as Carnegie Hall renovated & restored their interior a number of years ago, and likewise The Flatbush movie theater in The BK (!!!), I hope the Broadway Theatres invest a penny or two into their interiors too as the seating in many/most of those 'chambers of exhuberance' sometimes remind me of seating in The Tower of London.

Countries that have been compliant have achieved demonstrable success in keeping infection numbers enviably low. 

What is it in the psyche of a certain American that has disdain for and rebels against compliance with this simple precaution?

It seems a nation divided. But by what?I s it the divide of the red-state, blue-state politics?
The Retro vs. Metro regions  with their irreconcilable cultures? A cultural divide between the states then, that polarizes and seems unbridgeable?
Southern evangelical areas that tend to reject rhe scientific view  versus the new-economy winners,the ""liberal elite,"" with their contempt for Southerners?

2020-07-26 20:46:30,"I’m curious about two things the article did not address. The first question I have is what percentage of the people who are not showing up are staying home because they can work from home or because either the company closed or they lost their jobs.
The next question I have is that according to the article the building normally currently employs 8000 people￼. I wonder how many people worked in the building in the 1960s? The reason I think that’s important is that I don’t know currently how crowded the offices are. It’s one thing if you have a nice office and you enjoy going to. But the modern idea of squeezing as many people as possible into a tiny cuticles, Or worse having them share a table, is no fun and working at home is not a bad alternative. If we want offices to survive as a thing they have to be worth going to. It’s possible the office of the future is a combination of actual offices of reasonable size, I’m meeting places for everyone working remotely. I think the days of the bullpen are done."

Just a comment.  What if for example Germany thru the WHO comes to the market with a bonafide vaccine.  Will the Europeans vaccinate their people first on the supplies provided or would they with an open hand provide the Trump and the US quantities (which would dilute the Europeans ability to vaccinate their population.)

As an architect, however, having seen the advances in virtual reality in action, allowing one to walk through places that do not yet exist, I have to wonder if advances in technology are not so far away that we will be able to very closely simulate, through VR/AR, the experience of working side-by-side with someone who is in fact miles part.  If one truly stretches  one's imagination ,  then perhaps even the coincidental Crossings and meetings  can be  created in such a virtual world.

There was a landlord 2 blocks from me, a terrible elevator (small) building that was charging $3, 500 a month for a small studio. So now they're getting their due justice 
 New York is not fun anymore. Theatrebwas Untouchable, sure hudson yards was nice etc. But creativity was nil. I have a cabin Upstate and too many people are coming up here but there is space and clouds and fun artistic venues.. this is the pandemic's way of saying a city like New York needed a revision. Course other cities in other countries the loss there to me is inestimable. the cost of living in Manhattan was going through the roof. Not everybody can find a job that pays them six-figure income.

The virus is here and is going to be here until a vaccine can be administered, which is most likely at the end of this year or very early next year. Unfortunately, A certain percentage of the population are going to get the virus, and a relative minuscule number are going to die. Currently, California would be described as a dumpster fire with respect to virus numbers if it were led by a Republican governor, but their liberal governor pretty much gets a pass in the lib press. When this all started, the intention of the lockdown was to make sure hospitals are not so overwhelmed they cannot accept any more patients, that has never happened, not in a single state, city etc., some get relatively full, but within an entire area healthcare system not once has any of them got to the point where people are dying because they can’t get care, not a single case!￼￼ The current hysteria in the press gets many people freaked out because states have opened up, you don’t hear anything about the profound economic disaster that would happened if we had not opened up.

Having the flexibility to work from home is wonderful for the times when you need it, i.e. kids home sick, snow day, early weekend escape.  But prolonged, enforced work-at-home wears thin really fast and personal productivity can take a downward slide.  
When you're not in a Zoom meeting or working heads down on an exciting project, it becomes easier and easier to have one eye on the TV, put in a load of laundry, or run errands that somehow take a little longer than lunch hour. 
And while the company saves millions on real estate costs, the employee relinquishes some personal space.  Your desk (or dining room table) becomes your company's desk; your file drawers fill with corporate files; the cost of printer ink and paper that once was supplied by the company transfers to you.

I use parentheses because this isn't really a news article recording an event or development.  It's simply another opinion piece disguised as such.

NYC is not going to close up and blow away.  Yes, Covid is creating an enormous disruption to NYC -- particularly to its employment and real estate markets.

But they are indeed, Markets.  And Markets are a price adjustment mechanism.

Current vacant space in Manhattan office towers will eventually be occupied again -- either by the current tenants who most likely are under a lease -- or by replacement tenants who may indeed pay a much lower market rent than what was previously the case.

These articles bespeak primarily of reporters who have little historical understanding of both the City and how the real estate markets work.

The Covid disruption is indeed a deep disturbance that will require considerable readjustment.  There will be many landlords who will default on their mortgages due to tenant vacancies.  These defaults will in turn result in large losses to lender real estate departments -- whether banks, hedge funds or REETs.

But this will generate an enormous amount of real estate workout effort by building owners, lenders, CRE attorneys etc.

In the end the enormous office physical plant in Manhattan will find new tenancies and the hot dog guy will again sell tons of those insipid, tasteless meat byproduct things."

The zoom bandaid works well for a team that is already in place but many people switch jobs in order to grow professionally and personally.  Additionally, how will marriages function well long term if nobody ever leaves the house? Many couples need more space that they currently have in lockdown.

The chilly wind whipped my hair as I approached the sidewalk packed with pedestrians.

Recent experience reminds us that well-balanced, well-functioning, and self-sustaining ecosystems, be they social, economic, cultural, political, or environmental, can be more vulnerable, and more fragile than we would ever imagine or want them to be.  We must work together to restore them as best we can, and we should never take them for granted again."
2020-07-27 07:05:02,"The virus has exacerbated and accelerated trends occurring in our society, and has in some respects acted as a cathartic agent to generate those changes and trends. The 20-hour weekly commutes into soul-crushing glass towers of communal conformity were always a form of corporate cultural assimilation into a collective Borg. Now, workers will be able to better express their creativity through their individual work, not their sycophantic conformism which these office cultures demanded. Perhaps New York City will even begin to heal from its soulless and colorless descent into suburbia. It doesn't need any more malls, Victoria Secrets, or Class ""A"" office towers if it ever expects to return to the vibrant and richly colored city of its past. Frankly, New York is boring now."
2020-07-27 10:55:22,"As someone who did the commute everyday from CT into midtown as a Partner at a consulting firm I can tell you there is no place that gives you the energy (and the humidity) of midtown in late July/Aug. I miss the smell, the sounds, the access to everything, the client dinners and happy hours and Ubers home.  I never thought I would say this, but I really miss that rush to exit the north entrance of GCT to get to Midtown, wearing  a suit and tie, with the steam and humidity from the street below carrying you as you stop at a cart for an ice coffee.  Midtown was a magical place. Hopefully it’s not gone forever."
2020-07-27 04:11:20,"Dear New York Times, Please send some of your reporters west of the canyons of 6th Ave and see what is happening in your own back yard. Taking a walk in Hells Kitchen is like getting in a time machine and going back to the 70's. Most of your beat reporters are too young to remember or to have seen what it was like. We have 13 shelters in our neighborhood without adequate supervision for those who need it most. And HK deterioration has been swift and frightening. Come take a real look and see for yourself."
2020-07-27 08:40:02,"There are endless articles in the Times that skirt around the future of New York City. It is understandable that a New York Times will be self-servingly reticent to just come out and say it: NEW YORK IS FINISHED. The coronavirus pretty much laid to rest any illusion that corporate offices, at which all employees clock in at 9 and clock out at whenever, are necessary. Having learned, thanks to COVID-19 that they can operate without spending millions on overpriced office space in the City NO NEW LEASES ARE BEING SIGNED, and those coming up for renewal are being shrunk in size (if not 
 cut altogether) and bargained down to reflect the new supply/demand reality. As well, no one in their right mind would willingly enter a subway car or the elevator of a skyscraper. Add to this a mayor who, AT BEST rates a ZERO as the City's booster and, at worst, is seen as the cheerleader of destructive anarchists, and one understands why diehard New Yorkers are casting their final municipal ballot with their feet, as they rush to exit hatch for safer pastures. All this is already resulting in the shutting of philanthropic purses for cultural, medical and academic institutions, as rich people don't bet on sure losers. New York's cultural institutions are dead in the water. No one wold buy a Broadway ticket for a dollar let alone for $250. Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall collect dust. BAM is finished.  Tourists won't come to a city that has lost it's will to live. Tragic? Yes. But true."
2020-07-26 15:02:42,Thank you to this family for allowing the photographs of their loved ones to be shown. The impact is all that much greater to see the face of an unconscious ICU patient with all the medical equipment that is necessary to keep them alive.
2020-07-26 15:08:35,"Very touching testimony of the devastating effects of this pandemic. I hope this will incite all to take all required sanitary measures to keep themselves, and most importantly, others safe. Thank you for sharing this story. It can make a difference."
2020-07-26 15:15:29,"I wish this article was required reading for all the mask-less shoppers at Randalls. What a wonderful family! Hoping that 
Mr. Roberts will be able to enjoy his wildflowers and birds again."
2020-07-26 15:28:29,Heartbreaking article. Thank you for the very hard work reporting on this. I hope this reaches the right people.
2020-07-26 15:49:51,Everyone should read this.  Everyone.  Thank you for your reporting and to the family for allowing their story to be shared in this way.
2020-07-26 15:13:33,I wish every person who is resistant to wearing masks and taking other precautions would have to read this story.
2020-07-26 15:20:23,"The utter selfishness and ego-centricism of people who refused to wear masks after the first advisories to do so are disheartening to me.  (No, the CDC, et al. did not ever say masks did no good at all.  They said the average citizen should not wear them because the masks should be reserved for healthcare workers.  Plus, subsequent studies soon showed the benefits of simple masks; benefits that were unknowable earlier in an outbreak of a novel pathogen.  Sane and intelligent people change positions based on new information.  Ignoramuses stay committed to a position in the face of new, contraindicating information.)  

Additionally, it appears so many of the 'anti-maskers' are people with no sense of community or understanding of the 'general welfare' protected by the U.S. Constitution.  It has become such a sad commentary on the state of our society."
2020-07-26 15:25:17,"“Whoever came to the grocery store and didn’t wear a mask, doesn’t know this is going on.” This is the crux of our problem. Our government and news sources used to care about those who turned to them for honest, unbiased and fact based evidence that would help, not only those who stayed informed but, also those who only had time for headlines, to make common sense decisions based on science rather than rhetoric, ratings or re-election. Our divisions now take precedence over our response even when it could mean our demise. I’ve enjoyed the back and forth of politics for forty years now. Exchanging ideas, solutions and outlooks used to make my heart quicken with the prospect of changing people’s minds but that has been undermined by the systematic breakdown of a common reality. Trump’s assault on truth, with his 20,000 lies, his alternative facts and his fake news has brought us to the brink of Civil War, where what you stand for is secondary to who you stand against. I thought there would be a breaking point but he has now, figuratively, killed thousands of people on Fifth Avenue and not lost the bulk of his support, so it is up to the rest of us to defend reason, science and truth because those three things are, no longer, “common” sense."
2020-07-26 15:33:29,"I live in Houston and can attest that until Abbott put his long over due mask order in place people did not comply. Many in my neighborhood told others it was their “ constitutional right” not to, despite their willingness to follow seat belt laws and “no shirt, no shoes, no service” health directives — all in the shadow of one of the largest Baptist churches in existence."
2020-07-26 15:45:48,"Until recently, there were too many individuals who didn’t wear masks where I live in Houston, TX. The only place I went to was HEB to buy groceries, and the mask suggestion was ignored. Now, people wear masks, but have them below there mouth and nose. I watched two men without masks leave a local Walmart and not one employee said a word to them. Wearing a mask is not a politcial statement, but an act of caring for our fellow Houstonian’s. I am so sorry that the Robert’s family is going through this heartbreaking time."
2020-07-26 15:50:41,"Time and time again we read of the tragedy of a family contracting the coronavirus, often with deadly consequences, even though they felt they had done everything right, including the wearing of (usually low viral filtration) face masks.

Often these are multigenerational families where at least one person holds an essential job.

Isn’t it beyond time for the CDC to warn essential workers that an ordinary face mask does not offer them much protection? 

The CDC should run ads targeting essential workers, teaching them how to make higher filtration masks.

In the meantime, and don't hold your breath, essential workers, as well as everyone else who is in need of greeter protection, should head over to YouTube for these simple instructions."
2020-07-26 15:52:19,"I hope there are some people who so far resisting mask use who will read this. But it’s clear that there are too many who just don’t care. Some have even spat on store staff who hand out masks and remind them.  There’s an old saying, “hurt people hurt people.”  I think that’s true."
2020-07-26 15:04:19,"I’m not one to pray but after reading this, I’m praying for this family, and all the families like them, people who believed the science, did all that they could to be safe and keep others safe as well, and yet fell victim anyway. Victims of the virus, and of the selfishness of their fellow Americans, starting at the very top. It didn’t have to be like this. Heartbreaking."
2020-07-26 14:47:31,Best wishes for your recovery.
2020-07-26 15:12:39,I appreciate the strength of this family and send wishes for a full recovery.
2020-07-26 15:25:27,"This story brings home the reality of the COVID pandemic more than any graph, statistic, or list of numbers.  The pictures showing all of the machines being used to keep people alive, the picture of the staff member suited up to care for one man, these pictures show beyond the shadow of a doubt how serious this virus is, and how much technology is involved in treating those who are hospitalized, and how highly trained medical staff is required to operate the machines that are treating patients. Thank you for publishing this eye-opening article that makes it crystal-clear how devastating this pandemic is. I pray that those who choose to not take all recommended precautions will either read this article and look at the accompanying photos, or have someone describe this article and photos to them. 

Please publish more articles like this. Those who are getting overwhelmed by statistics may be encouraged to stay strong and implement all known precautions by simply looking at pictures with simple, clear captions."
2020-07-26 15:44:20,"I was expecting the pandemic to greatly affect our food supply,  but it really hasn't, thanks to the many many essential workers, including Ms. Roberts in Bellaire, TX.    I thank every worker at the grocery store."
2020-07-26 15:52:49,"My heart goes out to the Roberts family. It is scary to know that we can do what we are supposed to to protect ourselves, yet still get the virus. Why can't everyone realize that just one person refusing to wear a mask is all it might take to cause a tragedy that sickens an entire family this way? The selfishness in the face of this pandemic is staggering.

On a side note, this also brings home how very important it is to vote. We rarely grasp that voting could be a matter of life and death, but we are seeing how a commitment to public health must be a priority of our elected officials. If our nation's governors and president had taken appropriate steps early on to mandate masks, the US might not be leading the world in virus cases. Vote this November as if your life depended on it, because it might."
2020-07-26 15:34:42,"With this virus, to stay safe it's not enough to do all the right things. Everybody else has to do all the right things, as well. 
Until we all accept that reality, we're all at risk. 
An important article - for which the Roberts family deserves heartfelt thanks. 
And crowd-funding. On top of their terrible suffering, there will be enormous medical, rehab and homecare bills."
2020-07-26 15:38:46,I’m so sorry and sad to read about this lovely family’s troubles.   I hope Dad and Mom recover.  Sending them best wishes.
2020-07-26 15:07:47,I stay away from everyone. I have no idea who is asymptomatic and spreading the virus. I mask up when I go outside. No one is allowed in my house...ever. I live alone.....I have done this routine for 5 months and can do another 5. Another 5 after that? No problem. I appreciate how lucky I am and wish this family the best.
2020-07-26 15:08:53,"My heart breaks for this family and the unknown future they face as their well-loved father and husband attempts to recover.  Who can honestly say that the suffering these people, and tens of thousands like them, have had to endure is a reasonable price to pay for ""protecting the freedom"" of Texans to behave as selfishly and irresponsibly as they would like (by going about their daily lives as normal, refusing to wear a mask or social distance)?"
2020-07-26 15:09:38,"Frank O’ Hara wrote “in times of crisis, we must all decide again and again whom we love”.  This crisis has revealed that a lot of us don’t love our neighbours-as scripture insists we must, and a lot of us lack empathy. We must all be better. I hope this family gets back on their feet."
2020-07-26 15:31:01,We need more of these stories and fewer professional athletes/politicians in the news sharing their positive results and saying they feel fine.
2020-07-26 15:42:05,"I've gotten to the point now with the limited amount of visits I make to a grocery store, now mandated for face masks, the store closest to me is not going to be shopped at. 
There is only one store in this semi-rural community of Mpls-StPaul. 
I try to shop very early in the afternoon to avoids crowds but this Friday I was there a little later than usual. As I was walking around the store, about half the people there had no mask on. Of the people who were starting to walk into the store, none of them had masks. All looked younger than 40.
If the grocery store, under the new MN face mask mandate, can not or will not protect my health by enforcing the conduct of its patrons, Cub and Target are a short 15 mile trip away and it just cost that grocery store a customer who dropped about $800.00 a month there. 
It's about the only left we can do - boycott those stores who do not make those customers abide by public health mandates. I'm sick of their self-entitled I'm the center of the Universe attitude."
2020-07-26 15:04:32,"Unfortunately, as with many other illness, doing everything right isn’t a guarantee.  Preventative measures reduce the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, but one can still draw the short straw."
2020-07-26 15:01:09,It is so sad and disappointing to me that we cannot seem to cooperate to take care of one another. Whatever happened to the golden rule? Politicizing protection from a virus that causes long term health risks and even death for many people during a global pandemic is almost unbelievable. This is what a failing society looks like. Please consider the effects of your behavior on other people’s health and lives. Those of us living with illnesses that tend to make Covid-19 more dangerous are dependent on those of you at less risk of serious illness and long term complications and disability.
2020-07-26 15:39:09,"The importance of this reporting is that it shows how everyone must follow the CDC guidelines and cannot make independent decisions about their ""freedom"" without having a devastating impact on other people.  I will be forwarding this article to the people I know with a cavalier attitude about C19.  My heart goes out to this family."
2020-07-26 15:40:57,"So moving and well written. Many thanks to the Roberts family for sharing their story. It should be required reading for everyone who thinks the whole thing is a hoax, or for presidents who think playing golf is okay when 150,000 people have died."
2020-07-26 15:07:43,"It's not just Texas. I live in the SF Bay Area and my neighbors next door threw a huge family party in their backyard last night. 20 or more folks, kids, old people... no masks... like no pandemic was going on at all.

At the local grocery store, you can wear a mask and stand 6 feet apart at the checkout line, but it's pointless as people crowd through each other in the product aisles and hundreds touch the cooler doors and then itch their face.

It's starting to drive me insane."
2020-07-26 15:26:59,Thank you.  Should be required reading everywhere in the USA.
2020-07-26 15:28:54,"Those of us who are working hard to follow scientific guidelines are being victimized by our federal government, the GOP led states, and the ignorant.  Trump's America is a lesson of the consequences of having a charlatan as a leader supported by people too proud to own up to their mistakes.  My heart goes out to the Roberts family - and the millions like them."
2020-07-26 15:44:14,What a brave strong family the Robertses are to persevere through their ordeal. I’m optimistic that between their family’s love and the incredible care given by the Methodist providers they will pull through this nightmare. Virus deniers should be ashamed of themselves as should the anti-maskers.
2020-07-26 15:46:50,I am so overwhelmed with grief right now for the suffering and death of individuals and the thousands of families that could have been avoided if Trump had done his job.
2020-07-26 15:48:06,"So shameful that this could have been avoided had the Government been CONSISTENT with messaging beginning of February.  People still don't take this seriously. If masks are not mandated, every business owes it to their customers and employees to require it. Along with No shoes, no shirts, no service - add MASKS!  I live in a resort town, AIRBNBs are filled with multiple families, friends. No, it is not business as usual. I am afraid this Fall and Winter will be catastrophic. Mostly due to ignorance and greed."
2020-07-26 15:52:20,"Another result of the most devastating ""Hoax"" of all time.  

November can't come soon enough."
2020-07-26 15:04:26,"Let ""President"" Trump address this family directly. Let him show some compassion for people who are sick and dying thanks to his implied message, carried out through his minions in Republican state governments, is that this problem would go away if we all just ignored it hard enough. ""Governor"" Abbott could continue his role as Trump's echo in Texas by standing next to him and nodding along.

I know, it won't happen. None of these people have any regard for anything unless it can make them money and cement their hold on power. Those of us still alive in November need to vote every one of them out of office."
2020-07-26 15:19:11,"My adult niece had a mild case and is apparently recovering well.  She is in NY and has been partying it up, as evidenced by her instagram feed.  Her dad (my brother) is Republican and dismissive of the whole thing.  He called and told me she'd been sick, referring to the virus by a ""Chinese"" nickname (at first, I didn't know what he was talking about), and then, when I said I was glad she was okay, said that only ""a hysterical woman"" would worry.  I  ended up hanging up on him, I was so angry.  I texted my SIL and asked her to tell him that the racism/sexism is not funny and is not acceptable.  Her response was that well, he  and I will just ""never agree about these things.""  I don't think they understood my response that there's nothing to  agree  or disagree about.  I would forward this piece to my brother but there is zero chance he would read it.  But he and people like him are why we are in the mess we are in."
2020-07-26 15:07:37,What a heart wrenching story. Thank you to the Robert's family for giving readers an inside view of this horrible illness. I pray they family can make a full recovery.
2020-07-26 15:10:01,"Everyone should have an N95 mask.  Why in the world in this country, in 5 months time, haven't we made them, and handed them out to every living person??  Fabric masks DON'T PROTECT YOU. This poor woman will soon discover that AGAIN going back to work at a supermarket without one.  That's how she got the virus the first time, and sadly, that is how she will get it again -- she is inside for hours, in an air conditioned environment with an airborne virus and improper protection.  Everyone in this country should have free access to N95 masks and eye protection."
2020-07-26 15:18:28,"When a person does not wear a mask and is infected, every time he breathes he throws into the air tiny particles of the virus that by their size float, they are not as dangerous as those expelled when spoken, because they are attached to pieces of salivary fluid that serves as shells and feed them, making them potential killers.
It is not about wearing a mask when you go shopping if you live accompanied until you find an effective remedy against this virus, everyone inside the houses and outside them should wear masks and increase the home toilet with the use of disinfectants, not injected as advised the same that I dismiss the use of masks and I urge that the doors of the houses be opened to flood with people places where the virus could be Spread.
The virus is the bullet, the infected is the weapon, and those who have authority to handle human behaviors come to make the intellectual perpetrators of all the crimes caused by those mysterious particles that reproduce like rabbits."
2020-07-26 15:38:13,"I do not know how governors like Greg Abbott, Ron DeSantis and Brian Kemp, who have resisted and continue to resist mandatory masks in  public spaces, put their heads down at night.  I really cannot think how they sleep."
2020-07-26 15:51:58,"So sad, but I have to ask why are Republicans (of which I am one) in the Senate wanting to protect businesses that don 't practice what the CDC preaches.  If I was to get sick I would want the business that fails to comply be held responsible as well as the person that gave me the disease.  At some point in time, someone will be charged with reckless endangerment or worse."
2020-07-26 15:04:55,"The title of the article is catching, but what's the message and the logic to it? I drive carefully and certainly never under the influences, will I never get involved in an auto accident?"
2020-07-26 15:52:32,"This should be required reading for our Republican legislators and those who vote for them. I've had enough of their ""head in the sand"" responses to inconvenient truths."
2020-07-26 14:53:07,"Regarding the grocery store worker who “did the right thing” and still got covid, people like this with constant contact with the public should have access to surgical masks or even N95 masks. A homemade cloth mask is not the “right thing” for this level of potential exposure."
2020-07-26 15:09:12,Randall’s Market should play this video on a continuous loop for its customers.
2020-07-26 15:13:50,I can only hope that articles like these convince people that the pandemic is real and take all necessary precautions.
2020-07-26 15:26:44,"I know we have a problem in Houston, but the real disaster area is in South Texas, the Lower Rio Grande Valley.  Even before the hurricane right now pouring rain down on folks there and promising mass flooding, the situation was critical.  I have no idea why the national news media are focused on our situation when it's 10x worse in ""The Valley"".  Brace yourselves for some really tragic stories once the national media wake up to what's unfolding down there. :-("
2020-07-26 15:47:32,Hard to feel sorry for people that elected a businessman that ran six companies into the groud and who believes that he knows more about medicine than doctors.  These are the same people that ignore climate change warnings and elect other climate sceptics.  Hope they enjoy Covid-19.
2020-07-26 15:08:11,"Time and time again too many Americans keep failing the Human Empathy/Social Responsibility test that this virus has brought upon us. We call this a Public Health Crisis for a reason. If a high percentage of the public keeps behaving in the manner that may have 
doomed the Roberts family, we are going to get lockdown after lockdown until we get this right."
2020-07-26 14:51:51,"This story can be repeated tens of thousands of times and yet my fellow Americans could care less. We call ourselves Christian, a country under god. Who are we kidding, Trump exposed our selfishness , our bigotry and ignorance. Let Mother Nature teach us a lesson we won’t forget for a long long time. Maga country can go straight to purgatory."
2020-07-26 15:02:40,It only takes one slip up in not using masks or not washing hands to get covid.
2020-07-26 15:30:46,"This is who you hurt - the vulnerable and your / their loved ones - with your Trump inspired politization of masks. In no other country in the universe is mask wearing controversial. Shameless, shameful."
2020-07-26 15:33:10,"Israeli shops have security guards to stop antisemitic terrorists from entering. America needs the same to block those without masks. No guard, no mask, no shopping."
2020-07-26 15:33:55,This is so sad.
2020-07-26 15:38:13,that's sad that she has to go back to work at R's
2020-07-26 14:56:25,God bless the Roberts.
2020-07-26 15:12:53,Extremely sad story. Also what is sad this will not stop the people who do not believe in science. Thanks to our failed administration in the white house. It's a hoax. It will just fade away. The heat will kill it in the summer. The list of insane statements that came out of the the election. I mean Corona virus briefings is mind blowing. I am now even saddened more after typing out this post then the story I just read.
2020-07-26 15:05:54,"These anti-maskers are going to get people like my husband killed, and try to make people like me feel responsible. I’m going to be a bitter, angry widow. The store managers at Publix, Walmart, Walgreens, Ace, Lowes, etc.  refuse to enforce their own “masks required” policies, even when those are city ordinances. They claim that they don’t wish to put their employees at risk of violence. If that’s true, hire security. When I complain about the customers walking around unmasked, I’m told to use online shopping and curbside service. Isn’t that what you should tell the anti-maskers?"
2020-07-26 15:12:38,"Here in NW Montana, the number of licenses plates from Texas is more than I have seen in my 3 years here. Scary"
2020-07-26 15:13:33,"Trump, Texas Governor, Lieutenant Governor,  and so many other deniers are responsible for these tragedies. How do they sleep at night?"
2020-07-26 15:25:45,"I couldn't agree more, and now it's hardening into a resentment against these people who we were once called upon to ""understand"" their point of view. Their response has been to endanger my health, support Trump's daily vulgar and angry outbursts, and watch as unmarked goons tear gas and billy club ordinary Americans on our city streets. Time for a revolt."
2020-07-26 14:56:16,Donald Trump's incompetence and cavalier attitude toward the virus is to blame for this suffering
2020-07-26 15:42:01,"Heartbreaking and a real shame that this is happening. The virus is manageable but stupidity, poor public policies and lack of leaderships are not."
2020-07-26 15:59:09,"I wish this wonderful family well. There are so many secondary problems related to the virus that need to be talked about by Doctors and the media. And the statistics of these complications must be made known- in real numbers, hammer it home, the numbers and ages of people who suffer with conditions more serious than those caused by a mild flu."
2020-07-26 15:50:36,Just wear a mask people.
2020-07-26 15:27:13,Trump's next CV press briefing should be replaced with a ten minute video version of this story.
2020-07-26 16:10:08,"Thank you Sheri Fink for this heartbreaking story. And keep them coming. My husband and I were just discussing yesterday whether we might try doing some takeout or visiting an outdoor museum or public walking trail with masks. We are in Massachusetts where the numbers are relatively low. But one of us is immunocompromised. Stories like this remind me that for us, we still must be extremely vigilant. We are priveledged to have the choice."
2020-07-26 16:10:43,"I like many, start to think this isn’t so bad and we might be overreacting. Then I read stories like this one. I need to be more proactive in respecting the recommended protocols. 
 I am concerned for all the workers with daily exposure. It doesn’t seem real - until it does."
2020-07-26 16:22:31,"There's no question that trying to do the right things is NO guarantee you won't get it.  Statistically it should greatly improve your odds.  And it might well help you have a lower viral load and therefore a less severe case. 

But there is still quite a bit of luck involved.  It's very difficult to stay completely unexposed.  For a retiree like me, for instance, if I want to maintain my health, I need to go to the doctor and the dentist.  I need to procure food, which means either buying online and being careful with packages and contents, or I need to brave the grocery store, not go often, go when it's not crowded, and be careful with EVERYTHING. 

And I'm fortunate to be retired.  Many folks need to work and face lots of exposure. Or deal with raising kids. 

But ALL facets of life have trade-offs.  Older people, for example, statistically have had an opportunity to accumulate money over their career, but they generally also accumulate poorer health, through things like less organized and active immune systems, whether they maintain healthy lifestyles or not. 

It's about trade-offs.  Knowledge is power in helping make good, informed decisions to minimize risk to the extent practical for one's situation.  For that reason, I'm very grateful to the MSM, such as the NYT, for their active reporting on COVID-19, including pieces like this."
2020-07-26 16:31:59,"In some ways I find myself lucky, in that our tourist town was hit hard in March: hundreds of confirmed cases within a couple of weeks, with an infection rate that briefly eclipsed NYC; a complete, apocalyptic-ghost-town shutdown; and myself and many other people I know (under 40, generally healthy) being sidelined by the virus. Any temptation I might have had to wish the whole thing away or consider myself and my loved ones invincible was eradicated early on. 

My heart just shatters into a million pieces reading this family's story, and I pray that the father will recover. It makes me so nervous for my parents and siblings, who are at risk for severe illness if infected with the virus. They are careful, but, like this family, so many they come into contact with are oblivious or belligerently defiant about the virus' impact. And we are all scattered on the four winds, living our lives in different areas of the country -- returning to the homestead to help would be an epic odyssey for any of us, but one we will undertake if the need arises. 

Tragedy has a way of bringing people back together, which I suppose can be considered a sort of silver lining to all this. But one we hope we don't have to look for."
2020-07-26 16:36:11,"If a mask policy is going unenforced, I don't enter the establishment. The theater of resistance to this very simple and effective measure is beyond me.
My heart goes out to this family."
2020-07-26 16:37:00,"Thank you for this important article. I am holding this family in my heart.  I am shocked by the lack of masks and social distancing from so many people in the town nearby, defying their Governor's state wide mask mandate. Perhaps celebrity musicians who have influence need to create an ""anthem"" and a campaign to reach everyone ASAP to wear masks, social distance, wash hands, save lives."
2020-07-26 16:39:01,"Thank you for this article, Ms. Fink. It's both needed and powerful. And thank you as well to Erin Schaff for her exceptional images."
2020-07-26 15:55:10,"I hope governors who did not heed the recommendations read this article. How many illnesses and deaths are they responsible for? How do they sleep at night? Do they ever have a ""what have I done"" moment? My heart goes out to these and all the victims of this negligence."
2020-07-26 16:48:28,"Unfortunately this happens to this lovely family. But the notion that they did everything right is wrong because the state of Texas deny them doing everything right. The people in the grocery store who were not in mask and exposed their daughter denied them from doing everything right￼. Are federal government who Refused to act
To improve testing,  way past￼ the time when it should have been fixed has done little right. Our president who thinks that he can now five months later start talking about Mask we are like it’s an Epiphany did everything wrong￼. Our president who encourage states to ignore the CDC’s guidelines did everything wrong. So the sum total is everything was not right they were swimming upstream with no place to go but being dragged down by the currents of the pandemic￼"
2020-07-26 16:00:46,"Again, we see the devastating consequences of selfishness in our country. So many people in the US, starting with President Trump and going down the line, are too darned selfish to care about anyone or anything outside their own little world.

Masks — at least typical consumer-grade and homemade cloth masks — protect the people around you more than they directly protect yourself. When I wear a mask and you wear a mask, we are both protecting each other. When I wear a mask but you don’t wear a mask, I am protecting you but you are putting me at risk.

A surgical team wears masks and gloves in part to protect themselves from patient-borne pathogens but in greater part to protect the patient. Ditto for nurses, EMTs, dental hygienists, and so on. Similarly, people collecting biological or chemical samples wear masks and gloves largely to avoid contaminating those samples. It is not until you get into face shields, gowns, and true respirators that protection accrues more to the wearer than to those around her or him.

There is no doubt that COVID-19 is highly contagious. There *should* be no doubt that we are all in this together. There *should* be no doubt that we must all pull together to protect each other until we can get the spread of COVID-19 under control.

But so many of us are too selfish and shortsighted to think of protecting others. The irony is that when I protect you, I am protecting myself as well. Our collective health is good for all of us.

Put on a darned mask!"
2020-07-26 16:07:15,"I am not aware of what is seen on social media but have been wondering whether massive numbers of PSAs from local and state governments pleading for mask wearing are posted.
If not, why not?
I have seen very few on TV. 
Why is a national ad campaign not used ? 
Why were no planes trailing messages￼ over beaches not used?
Many entities besides the government could sponsor creative messaging.
American ingenuity, not to mention patriotism, remember?"
2020-07-26 16:22:04,"If you don’t want to get COVID-19, wear an n95 if inside public places. We can not rely on others to wear a facemask, since so many so selfishly won’t. A simple mask, which is mainly to prevent spread to others, is insufficient for protection against airborne virus."
2020-07-26 16:23:12,A devastating report. If only we could trace the disease back to those who don’t wear masks and arrest them for the harm they inflict on others.  Perhaps that would make it real to them just like drunk driving convictions did to those who drove under influence of alcohol.
2020-07-26 16:31:34,"Even if this terrifying disease could not be stopped entirely it could have been mitigated by the president and governors who only got involved when it was much too late.  These people in control across the nation are guilty of manslaughter in the classic sense of the word.  Their actions or lack thereof have resulted in the pain, suffering and dearth of Americans across throughout the country.  We should make them account for their dereliction of duty at the ballot box if by no other means.  I have a daughter and family in Houston and fear for their lives daily.  This did not have to be a disaster for our nation or this family who did all the right things!"
2020-07-26 16:08:39,"The key sentence is that the governor did not make masks mandatory.

Our governor in Ohio did early, but recanted when “people were not ready.”   HUGE missed opportunity.
Now he has made them mandatory, after we became a hot spot.

Come on leaders, make them mandatory while we wait for the scientists and and drug companies.  They are doing research 
at a heroic pace.   Until then, mask up people, even if your leaders are too afraid to say so."
2020-07-26 16:33:47,"People can give up their 'freedom' and not smoke inside to prevent others from secondhand smoke, but they cannot wear a mask inside to prevent the spread of a deadly serious virus?"

2020-07-26 16:00:31,"We, in the USA, like to think that we are so noble and charitable.  This pandemic has revealed the harsh reality:  we are certainly not as good as we thought.  How, for the love of God, did the charitable act of wearing a mask, become such a point of contention?

Communicable diseases spread by contact.  Ergo, minimize contact, and control the spread.  It is painful to witness suffering that might have been avoidable if  proper leadership had been experienced."
2020-07-26 16:24:23,"The lack of empathy from this generation of Americans has been fully exposed. Not even life is really considered. Even with hospitals filled up, we have those that refuse to follow basic guidelines that would have protected this family. We are as cruel a society as any out there.

Historians will be writing extensively of this period and the people that lived in it."
2020-07-26 16:30:53,"Stores need to hire security guards specifically to enforce mask rules.  One guy in the back monitoring security camera's is all it would take, and cashiers should refuse to serve anyone without a mask.   Dead people don't shop."
2020-07-26 16:34:02,"And today we get to read elsewhere that the ""face mask"" you bought online should have been labeled as only a ""face mask fashion cover"" because it's not thick enough to protect anyone from anything and should only be worn over another type of mask.  It's pretty clear that zero people are going to make that correction, or even be aware a correction should be made.  We are just stuck in a different kind of loop."
2020-07-26 16:36:43,"Yes, for all the talk and effort that has gone into masks and social distancing,  the virus will find you.  Give that is he reality, it makes sense to move forward with life and not to be held hostage by the virus.  This is, essentially, Trump's approach."
2020-07-26 15:56:21,"I loved the part about how Elaine didn’t speak until she was 8, then the words came out in a burst during a trip to Disney World. 

There’s a short story there. Or something."
2020-07-26 16:39:03,"I hope this heartbreaking story reaches people who have a problem with wearing masks. It's not just about them but about families such as this. And about the health care workers, so exhausted and overwhelmed. When will all our leaders truly lead? We should take to the streets and demand what we expect from this President. This country is truly in crises!"
2020-07-26 16:27:15,"Thank you for this well-written story.  I’m guessing most people reading it are pro-mask and believe already in the seriousness of the pandemic, as well as the failures in leadership that have gotten us here.
It seems to me that our job now is to reach those people who are not taking this seriously.  How can that be done?  Social media influencers, psychologists, advertisers, celebrities, economists, are these the people we need to enlist to change the behavior of Americans who are not listening to science?  Hypnotists?
Can we pay people to wear masks, stay home, get a check when case numbers go down? 
America is, um, exceptional, especially in terms of leadership.  We may need to come up with creative approaches as appealing to common sense, logic, and empathy don’t seem to be working."
2020-07-26 15:55:35,Agreed the disease is a problem but it should be noted that her parents have at least 4 or 5 serious comorbidities which makes them super high risk to COVID or anything else for that matter.  Their daughter is obviously much younger hence little happened to her. A sad story none the less
2020-07-26 16:22:34,"Lots of disinformation, yes, but also lots of selfishness that supports and chooses to believe the disinformation over other voices and plain facts in front of them.

Selfishness built into the mythical self-made, independent libertarian aspect of our national psyche, even though the moment anyone gets sick, or is threatened by a disaster, the government (or caring neighbors, including those who pay taxes) is nevertheless expected to come to the rescue.

Other psychological attributes make it far worse, even for those who did initially try to follow the rules: no patience and perseverance, along with what I see as an almost pathological need to ‘have fun’, even amid a pandemic with people sick and dying, as a means of coping by denial.  After just a few months, many assumed and wanted this to be ‘over’ so they can get back to ‘normal’ and hang out in bars and on beaches.

So we end up with ‘covid parties’ while medical professionals, who have paid some of the worst price for this self-centered adolescent behavior, have to step in to treat them because they remain the responsible adults in the room; only as they lay dying do the foolish partiers admit they were wrong."
2020-07-26 16:23:17,"Whenever I hear people crowing about how the disease “isn’t always fatal,” I think of the hundreds of thousands of individuals, families, friends, and communities that have been through situations like this. Many individuals will have sustained long-lasting and life-altering complications of their Covid-19 infection, which will be even more pervasive if theirs came to a battle with death. Even after a vaccine is found and disseminated (and who knows when that will be, and how long it will take), we will be a world of walking wounded. And, in a not entirely unrelated vein, it infuriates me to watch the G.O.P. split hairs over long-term economic aid, saying extended unemployment benefits dissuade people from returning to work. This family is lucky to have some income, but what about millions of others? You can’t work if there’s no job to go to, or if you’re in the hospital on a ventilator, or hungry and homeless after having been evicted. And you certainly can’t return to work if you’re dead, which many will be if Republicans keep pushing their partisan agendas and avoiding crucial public health mandates, rather than facing up to our common enemy: SARS CoV2. The economic support—and, moreover, a strong public health message—is so necessary, because, to quote Yeats, we “Are changed, changed utterly”."
2020-07-26 16:27:42,"Texas politics driving anti-maskers have devastated this fragile young woman’s family. My elderly household, with a daughter nearby who’s the age of their young daughter, tried to return to limited activities as the governor opened the state prematurely. We returned to lockdown voluntarily earlier this month when the mask mandate resulted in more flaunting of unmasked faces locally as our law enforcement was among the first in Texas to declare “refusal to enforce mask wearing.” Our county’s infection numbers have soared and we were among the areas of concern in the recent unpublished White House report. Living in fear and anxiety will shorten our lives but inconsiderate adults may kill us or disable us very soon."
2020-07-26 16:05:38,"Thank you to the Roberts family for sharing your experience. I almost did not read it because I was so afraid that one of you would have died. Right now I am getting grief from family and friends who say I am being too cautious and too paranoid, your story gives me added incentive to just stay home!"
2020-07-26 16:50:58,That last sentence is a gut punch. Though I don't know why the medically fragile  parents would let the daughter continue working at the grocery store in the first place.
2020-07-26 15:54:07,"The headline is misleading. The story is not that she did the right things and got it anyhow, she did not do the right things, she went to work and was around many people who did not wear masks. That was not the right thing. The true story was that her economic conditions and the lack of caring from her employer forced her into a risky situation."
2020-07-26 16:06:22,"Dr. Fink has connected all the dots here.  Her reporting throughout this pandemic is again Pulitzer worthy.

Shame on the politicians that let this happen, the organizations that have not given consistent messaging, and the people who still feel “American exceptionalism” means everyone but them.

Just wear a mask.  
Give people their space.
Stay home and reconnect with your family, I’m sure the Roberts wish they could."
2020-07-26 16:12:51,"Thanks @sherifink for such clear story. 

So tired of the politicians who make corona virus into a political one upsmanship. Let's face it, President Trump has let us down…and proving his cognition by taking a mental test that is reminiscent of those tests that they run on Facebook for fun doesn't take him off the hook for what our fellow Americans—be they Republic, Democrats, black, white from the wrong side of the tracks—have to endure because he showed no wisdom in leading us through the pandemic. 

For this family to tell their story, I will wear my mask, I will create arcs of social distancing, I will support those politicians who are doing their best to see us through this pandemic by holding strong to long term policy."
2020-07-26 16:49:16,"There are 16 known coronoaviruses. They are well known for their ability to jump species barriers from animal to bird to snake to bat to human, etc. 7 coronoaviruses have made the jump to humans. 4 cause the common cold (antibodies they leave behind give between 1 to 2 weeks ""immunity"" if any). SARS conferred immunity on some of its victims for up to 2 years. MERS, on occasion, for up to 3 years. To date, NO successful vaccine has been found for any of these 6 coronaviruses, though there were many ""promising"" candidates for both SARS & MERS.

We known a long more about SARS-CoV-2 (the virus) & COVID-19 (it's disease) than we did a couple of months ago. We know antibody production by COVID is low & sometimes nonexistent. We know that, within a couple of months, antibodies begin to fade away & that there are many documented cases already of people catching COVID a second time. We know that most of the swab tests (especially the quick-return ones) are inaccurate & have a high false negative. We know that Quest & LabCorps antibody tests only test for a subtype of antibody that doesn't give immunity. We know that most of the ""reagents,"" which are in short supply, are defective & come from China. We know that COVID can lie dormant in the future, hiding in bats, snakes & birds only to re-emerge next year or 5 years from now. We KNOW that COVID, now that it jumped the boundary from Yunnan Elephant Bats to humans last winter, is going to be a disease in the human community forever."
2020-07-26 16:43:03,Dr Fink writes very well. A very sad situation with this family. I just hope that things will get better and they can get leave the hospital. Masks should be mandatory everywhere in the country.
2020-07-26 15:56:36,How heartbreaking. This sounds like a lovely family.  I hope the Father recovers and they can continue their spirited games of Uno soon.
2020-07-26 16:26:09,"It is still hard to find an authoritative discussion on masks - short of genuine N95(not Chinese knockoffs) and true surgical masks, what constitutes a good one?
For cloth, the more layers the better, yet I've purchased 3-layer ones on line where when held up to light, many tiny ""holes"" pass light(and air). With Amazon, reordering good ones from the same seller may result in their substituting a different seller, as they did for the original thick masks I'd bought, sending the poor ones - refund given, but no masks!
Masks with vents can expel unfiltered breath, yet a quick view of listings online show many with such vents being sold as ""comfortable.""  Similarly we see people wearing face shield instead of masks - not effective for either the wearer or those around.  And at our supermarket, many workers have their masks down below their nose, meaning they are breathing in unfiltered air in close buildings with recirculated air.  Not good?!
In the long run, better a poor mask than none, still the choice of way too many people.
Please, Dr. Fauci, Johns Hopkins, give us solid guidelines."
2020-07-26 16:03:06,"I’ve worked in a hospital emergency department and done freelance press photography, separately. I object to the suddenly new fashion of “news” photography inside hospitals, especially of any patients.  Everybody is doing it now. There must be dozens of such insider reports all over the country.
If anyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy it is in a hospital. It’s specifically protected by law and by hospital policy. Of course a photographer can obtain permission but in the case of unconscious patients such permission is impossible. It doesn’t really matter much if you conceal their face. If they survive and see the news story a patient can recognize themselves, which can be a source of embarrassment.  They are recovering from a near fatal illness with a long convalescence. Personal embarrassment is not helpful and entirely preventable as far as news reporting is concerned. These are not pubic persons walking on pubic streets. A doctor, a legal fiduciary, who is required by law look after the best interests of his patients, should not allow it. Unless a family member has a specific medical power of attorney, (who does?) they cannot give legitimate consent for such photography. Even if not published others see those photos. They should not exist. The public doesn’t have a right to see them. It’s private.
This is my 4th comment on this subject and the NYT has not bothered to post any of them. They must be afraid I am correct and others might realize they have rights."
2020-07-26 16:03:07,"Triage in Houston. Turns out it’s the Republican Party that’s behind death panels. As Asia and Europe now show, the more virulent virus is truly man-made, and its Patient Zero spends his time playing golf while Rome burns."
2020-07-26 16:42:18,"This is heartbreaking. It shows how cruelly selfish and evil Trump and the governors of Texas and FL are. Texas is being hit by a hurricare. That's going to make it much, much worse for Texans. How do you socially distance yourself in a hurricane? Covid-19 is so new (novel), no one knows if someone actually recovers from it or has any immunity if they do. There doesn't seem to be enough data about how it affects children. I'm 76 and I've been wearing a mask from the beginning. This story is doubly disheartening because the members of this family were so careful."
2020-07-26 16:42:37,"It might be helpful if this  story, complete with its haunting photographs, could be published in full in outlets other than the NYT, where people who still don't believe this virus is a serious problem might read it, or at least glance at the pictures and the headline and make a connection.  I suspect by running it here you are mainly preaching to the choir."
2020-07-26 16:00:09,"Masks Were ‘Kind of 50-50’.  People who disagree with you might maim or kill you, and there are a lot of people who disagree. Not much you can do to make immediate impact."
2020-07-26 16:05:02,"Greg Abbott and Dan (grand parents should take a bullet for the team) Patrick, you own this.   It's through your politically motivated policies and denial of the epidemic that this and similar stories across Texas are playing out hundreds of times each and every day.   Are for what?   So entertainment venues can reopen?    So that people might be inconvenienced by wearing a masks 3 months ago?   Did you really think that reopening wouldn't result in spread to vulnerable populations?    Whose your medical consultants?  GOP cronies spouting optimistic fantasies needing fat consultants fees or did you just use tarot card readers?    Worst case guys you needed to be planning on worst case.   

You could have stopped this epidemic in its tracks in Texas in April when there were 25 cases a day in Texas.  And we would have a viable economy minus a few sectors.   The result of your misguided decisions?  The hundreds dead per day will continue and get worse.   There will be no economic recovery, cities will reduce services to a minimum.   Unemployment will result in hundreds of evictions per day and hundreds of foreclosures.   You wanted open economy, now you'll get thousands sick per day and no economy.  

Open schools?   Good luck with that.  Enough teachers, staff, administrators will be infected within weeks that the uninflected will be MIA.   

Honest men would resign after such abject failures of leadership."

2020-07-26 16:34:59,"Note to those who resist mask-wearing: Put politics aside. Simply covering your nose and mouth with a mask during this worldwide pandemic--which costs just a few dollars--can prevent folks like Mr. Roberts from needing hospitalization, ICU care, ventilators, multitudes of medical tests, and months of rehabilitation--which costs MILLIONS of dollars. 

There is no better investment. JUST DO IT!"
2020-07-26 16:43:16,"The right thing would have been a state wide mandatory mask order by the deadly governor. The right thing would have been the store posting a Mask Required Order. Without either of these, the right thing would have been not reporting to the store for sacking duty. The people “in charge” are going to kill one and all if they can get away with it. And they are getting away with it."
2020-07-26 16:26:35,"Because Covid is spread within the family, children cannot return to school.  Imagine how horrible a child will feel if they have to wonder if their failure to wear their mask properly, or wash their hands or trip to the bathroom caused their mother or grandmother to die.  Better to stay home. 

As a nation we have to make sure all children have access to and know how to use the technology to learn at home.  In the future this knowledge will be invaluable and will lead to less inequality."

Unfortunately, frontline workers like Elaine Roberts (and by extension, their families) have no way to self distance from selfish willfully ignorant Trump supporters who have been led to believe their right to infect others with a deadly disease is inalienable.

As a result we can't trust them or even their local leaders to make the right decision. We need laws in place requiring mask usage nationwide months ago.
2020-07-26 16:52:18,"Anyone who still supports Republicans in Texas is brain washed . Trump is trying to create an emergency before the eiection similar to what Putin would do to not recognize the election results.

He has set up businesses with his family inside China while arguing with them is just a front or a mirror that blocks the real image of what is occurring.

2020-07-26 15:35:58,"The minute I saw this article, I knew what I would learn: Lots of Americans are still in denial about the dangers of this virus, and the rest of the country is suffering the hard reality. 

A week ago I stood at the counter in my local Post Office. Everyone inside observed the rules posted on the front door. We wore masks and stood six feet apart. I told the employee what I needed, and he picked up my packages with his hands enclosed in rubber gloves. I made a friendly remark about the unusual situation we were all in, and he surprised me with his reply. 

""All this is the biggest joke I ever saw."" He gestured to the plastic sheet between us and our face masks.

""Well, many people are sick and dying,"" I said. 

""People are dying from the flu and other diseases,"" he said. 

""At my age,"" I said,"" I don't want to get the virus.""

He gave me the receipt, and I left, but I had a clearer view of how deeply misinformation about the virus has trickled down from our leader in the White House. Please don't think this is a diatribe against the Post Office. I don't want our Post Office to change or to go away. I want our national leadership to change AND to go away. 

Thank you so much for this article."
2020-07-26 15:22:25,"This is an incredible, invaluable article. My heart goes out to the whole family and I hope that Mr. Roberts' recovery goes well.

They do not understand that their casual flouting of scientific consensus can have such devastating consequences on an individual level."
2020-07-26 15:40:15,"I visited my wife’s family in China back in January for Chinese New Year. The day we arrived in Beijing, was the day they locked down Wuhan. Without the government’s official guiedelines, everyone at the airport was wearing masks. Everyone. Like China, many other countries had difficult battles against COVID-19, but they were able to control it because the people respect science and other people’s lives. Freedom cannot be reduced to “being the most comfortable yourself”. There is a subtle line between a free person and a selfish person. Choose the right side of history cannot be easier now. Just wear a mask."
2020-07-26 16:02:31,"As this article vividly demonstrates, the reason to wear a mask is not just to protect yourself, but to protect others. There is only so much one person can do to protect themselves--we need to recognize that we're all in this together. The article is also a moving illustration of how the virus can spread from young, healthy people to more vulnerable people. I very much fear we will see many more tragic accounts like this one as K-12 schools and colleges try to reopen. Thanks to the families who shared their experiences with us--I hope they all regain their health soon!"
2020-07-26 15:54:03,"This story was incredibly moving to read. Thank you Ms. Fink and the Roberts family for telling this incredible story. While my father's (72 yrs old) story is somewhat different, I am also challenged to not react to others who tell me the virus isn't real or my father ""didn't have COVID-19."" What inspired me to write a response was the last minute planning that takes place when your loved one is sick with coronavirus--going from being primarily independent to now almost entirely dependent upon long-term care. This places a lot of pressure on our health care system (insurance and costs of getting sick) to walk into the crisis with us, than place us in this metaphorical waiting room for 6 months to two years. The discrepancy, unfortunately, is that health problems quickly arise, decisions need to be made quickly, and the health care system takes their time in processing requests (i.e., my applications to Medicare B that were denied twice due to applying outside of open enrollment). Similar to the Roberts' oldest daughter, I am also 38, but an only child. Upon my father's admittance to the hospital for coronavirus, I didn't expect to make his end of life care decision, eventually become his conservator or thinking that I would be best friends with nursing home providers. I wish the Roberts family all the best in coping with the aftermath of coronavirus--assuming we can call it that. Thank you!"
2020-07-26 15:14:26,"Thank you for this story. This Randalls is 2 miles from my home. I, personally, know another family who's daughter works at a grocery store, become positive, and spread it unwittingly to the rest of her family. Older father also had rot be hospitalized. Everyone feels afraid to confront the non-mask wearers."
2020-07-26 16:23:26,"Such a compelling story and a very brave and lovely family - each and every one.  I was fearing the worse for Mr. Roberts, but I am so glad to learn that he pulled through with his wife and daughter, Elaine.  Yes, he still will need much rehab to recover, but I gave no doubt he will with a loving family urging him on.  The Roberts family is truly inspirational.  I wish them the best."
2020-07-26 17:14:15,"I am heartbroken at this story and furious with the people who refuse to wear masks. I am a pharmacy technician who has been supporting my district to set up drive thru testing at multiple stores, as well as going to long term care facilities to do rapid tests on employees and residents. In my experience, the majority of people who test positive at the LTC facilities are asymptomatic. 

We have customers who come into our stores who refuse to wear a mask, but we are only allowed to suggest they put one on. People who will move around the side of the sneeze guard and lean over the counter, as if it is an obstacle as opposed to a protective measure. I have been to stores where multiple staff members become infected, even though they are taking all the appropriate precautions at work.

Besides the daily complaints we receive from many customers about doing testing, requesting that they wear masks, not telling other people to put on masks, plus the regular abuse that is hurled at us, we come to work everyday and risk the health of ourselves and our families. 

I love my work because I am helping people, but it enrages me that they refuse to wear a mask to safeguard unknowingly infecting other people—like the daughter in this story. Wearing a mask is the least someone can do to show they respect the people who have to go to work and provide them necessary services."
2020-07-26 17:21:26,"Prayers to you, Roberts Family, especially Mr. Roberts.  So sorry you are going through this difficult time.  Sharing your story will save lives, and I hope that's some comfort right now."

The governor who is without a doubt, personally responsible, for killing people who have died from the trumpandemic? Will he be charged with the murders he's committed, or are we so sick as to allow him to walk free?"

When Trump does something, he does it 100% , his would have been a nationwide mask mandate for everyone, even kids, even people with fake health conditions , with zero tolerance, free MAGA and Trump 2020 masks would be handed out to the poor and homeless and straight to a crowded jail for anyone caught without a mask, (and no masks for inmates as part of the punishment ) , the media and Democrats would cry foul and be suing for heavy handed police tactics and Trump being draconian and too authoritarian and forcing the poor to wear campaign slogans on their masks."

Abbott & Trump have created so much suffering, so much death.
If you live in an area with lots of cases, and you can swing it, don't send your kids to school. The risk is too high.
And everyone should stay out of all stores, including grocery stores. Curbside (and delivery) everything if you can.
The risk here is too great. Don't risk. Patience, patience.
Human-to-human transmission of a lethal virus means, in pandemic times, stay away from humans. No matter what your governor or president says."

2020-07-26 17:27:21,"Every story of illness, recovery, ongoing relapses or death needs to be written and recorded every single day and published locally and nationally.  The attitude near where we live, a town of 3K in central eastern Idaho, as in Darby and Hamilton, MT, comments we’ve received, “are you a Democrat”, or “is it Halloween?”

Unfortunately, it’s hardened me to not caring about the anti-maskers health and survival if they don’t care about mine.  We’ve worn masks since 3/25, continue to do so and distance ourselves from those anti-maskers including his family.  Who I do care the most about are all the health care professionals who have to save anti-maskers lives when they get sick. 

My husband is a wildland firefighter, he’s received snarky comments to his mask wearing, I’ve wanted him to say “you never know who’ll come to your door to take you in an ambulance or to life-flight to the hospital”, or “will you ask me that when I come to fight the wildfire coming your way?”  Anywhere, because of open or concealed carry (my husband carries) we have to be concerned someone may go off if you make a comment at all.

It’s a mask.  It will help keep the economy open and running, and recover.  Just wear it."
2020-07-26 17:08:46,"This is a hard story to read and one that I suspect is not that uncommon right now.

And it points to the need for higher quality masks for all Americans, not just healthcare workers.  These simple cloth coverings that Elaine Roberts wore may be protecting others, but for the vulnerable, it only takes one person to infect them.  

Once again, the federal government needs to ramp up production of surgical style, anti-viral N95 masks for distribution nationwide (e.g., like those once made by Curad).  And all Americans need to wear them.  This is a failure of government that they haven't even tried."
2020-07-26 17:09:29,We need to stop just counting the death toll and count the expense of weeks in an ICU and months in rehab for tens if not hundreds of thousands of people. Add to that a life of chronic disability many will now experience with reduced productivity. Those costs dwarf the cost of keeping the economy closed for 8 weeks and paying people to stay home to suppress the Virus. Why have we elected such short sighted people?
2020-07-26 17:11:12,"Wonderful piece; it makes the very important point that individual health is dependent on public health. As scrupulous as this family has been, it could not protect itself from hazards in its community. This is very sad and none of us can say we wouldn't suffer the same fate.

It takes a government. Yet, all we hear from governments is mixed messages often preaching individual responsibilities to mask, wash and distance. 

The lessons from countries with zero to a few hundred deaths and minimal if any lock downs or school closures is early testing done in conjunction with tracing and expanded medical personnel and PPE. These are services only governments can provide. 

If scientists and the media could have been more forward with what government owes us, we might have provided public pressure.

As it was, Trump, 50 state governments and umpteen counties ad libbed their way through this pandemic. It could have been Improv theater.   We know Trump censors the CDC and his two medical experts and, whether virtuous or not, Redfield, Fauci or Birx didn't speak up enough to get themselves fired. 

When testing was available, it seemed more like a consumer service for purchase rather than a monitoring of cases by public health. And, like toilet paper, it turns out the supplies were inadequate.

Consider also the unequal distribution of wealth and basic services in our nation to understand our nation was already weakened before the virus hit."
2020-07-26 17:36:23,Thanks to the NYT and the Roberts family for sharing their story. I hope they recover well. I'm seeing more and more friends posting pictures on social media sometimes in groups of 5 or more without masks or social distancing. These are educated people who know the virus is real but I suppose have become complacent even though we live in a city where cases are increasing. It's very upsetting especially when reading a story like this.

I am sorry for these horrible things your family is going through. And it is impossible that the people refusing to wear masks do not know what is going on, that their failure to be decent human beings is putting people like your sister, mother, and father at grave risk."
2020-07-26 17:22:59,"As a guy who was an experimental scientist as opposed to a theoretician, give me the hard data any day.

We are now approaching 150,000 deaths from Covid-19.

Many of the people who suffer but survive have long term health issues.  Since we have about 4 million confirmed cases, if 10% have health issues, that is 400,000 more people.

So to all of those who think this is a hoax or ""the sniffles"" the data suggest you are wrong, mistaken, INCORRECT.

Look at the FACTS. Even in RED states like TEXAS (7,735) and GEORGIA (3,787) many thousands of people are falling sick every day, and thousands have died so far (Texas  5,069, Georgia 3,495).

That data is for Saturday July 25 as reported by

They don’t like to think or read.  They do like to watch Fox News on TV endlessly.  They believe lies and can’t reason.  In Southern California they are having saturation ceremonies at the beach that draw almost two thousand unmasked, undistanced people.  Not sure what a saturation ceremony is other than another way to saturate Southern California with the virus.  Many will die, more sickened with lasting symptoms.  All needlessly.  Just as the myth of lemmings running off cliffs was invented by Disney, the myths driving their equally cartoonish lives now pushed to self destruction are based on thoughtlessness and greed."

Likewise similar mentality of people trying to kill us with COVID.  
Laws and leadership actually can work. A few Republican governors like Larry Hogan of MD have shown leadership, most of the rest of them are cowards. No words can describe what Trump has done to the USA and the number of deaths he caused.  It’s worse than horrible because so many deaths were avoidable by just getting everyone to wear a mask."
2020-07-26 17:39:15,So much community protection could be achieved if senate republicans cared about enacting policy directed toward such. But their clear priority is in protecting the corporate sector. Protection from liability when failing to protect workers. How crazy does this sound?! A company is free from liability for not taking precautions in protecting the health and life of their workers. But that “essential” employee can be forced to return to work by denying unemployment benefits!       VOTE. THEM.  ALL.   OUT. !
2020-07-26 17:31:41,"Here is another story of a family devastated by this virus.  I live in a part of Washington state that is only now being visited by this plague.  Our governor mandated face masks about a month ago.  The response to this mandate has been hysterical.  I still see several people in the grocery store not wearing a mask. Defiantly. Daring someone to say something.  I want to yell, ""You are putting my friends who work at this store at risk.  Can't you just wear a mask for 15 minutes.  They have to wear them for 8 hours to protect you and your family!""
I know they won't listen.  They are member (victims?) of a cult and display their allegiance with their t-shirts and red caps. Although their leader has made some tepid nods to masks, the acolytes know he doesn't mean it.  Works great for him.  Not so much for American families."
2020-07-26 17:35:58,"I am very sorry about what happened to your family. I am very angry about the attitude of those not wearing masks. Some say they are in denial. Other say they are inconsiderate. Either way it hurts because that shows so many Americans are not caring for other Americans.

It's not just Trump supporters. I live here on the upper west side of Manhattan, NYC, a fortress of hardcore democrats. Nonetheless, a significant number of people here are still not wearing masks to this day after losing 23K New Yorkers.

What's more, those wearing masks are trashing used masks in the ocean and trashing national parks. Just read these articles here. On top of that, major destructions in big cities all over the United States are on going.

This uncontained uncaring attitude is hard to tolerate.  I'm seriously considering leaving this country when I retire which is within 10 years from now. I am sorry but I am giving up."

How , then, is it possible to tether the people to certain constraints like masking, social distancing and self inflicted isolation without embarking on a blitz of public edification..?More so, some despicable restrictions could be motivated only by promulgation of law.In the instant case, the Nation  is running on the rudiments of federalism with a vengeance, such as different states have different rules while they have to promote a single role of national health. While it is ardently hoped that the pursuit of a vaccine does not mimic the trail of the holy grail,,humankind has to wait with bated breath till its arrival in the viable market.In the meanwhile, the powers that be have to embrace a farsighted dissemination of the safety measures, when push comes to shove."

I wear a mask every time I leave my apartment, which is becoming less and less frequent, because I worry about contracting the virus from people who are not adhering to the protocols.  How ironic and frustrating that people who do not wear a mask and/or follow social distance are enjoying fresh air and sunshine while I am relegated to staying home in order to protect myself."
2020-07-26 17:36:28,"This story is so deeply moving and important to read. The lives of the people who are being impacted and infected- their complexity, tenderness, and humanity; their fragility, strength and histories- this is what is at stake in this pandemic. I think when we stop as a collective society to deeply consider all of the beings that are whole people, separate from numbers on an incomprehensible scale... for me it is nearly too much to bare. 

Thinking about this family and sending strength and healing wishes to them."
2020-07-26 17:30:51,"I am sorry to read about the Roberts Family and their health challenges. I wish more people could consider thinking about others outside of their own households. 

I spoke with good friends over the weekend who espoused the idea that they do not want to socially distance or wear masks because they believe we need to reach a point of herd immunity, and in fact that is the best way out of this situation. They believe there will be a vaccine in the future. They are respectful and will wear masks in stores if others do and it is required, but continue to have maskless social gatherings in their home. They would rather go on with life and are willing to die to continue a normal life. 

My objection to this is twofold. They are able to isolate and work from home. They get to pick and choose who they expose themselves to.  As a nurse, I do not have that luxury. I get exposed to both symptomatic and asymptotic patients in labor and delivery. 
In addition, dying may not be the worst outcome of being infected with Covid. It could be that an infection causes a lifetime disability, or a stroke, or COPD, or a family member has complications that mean a long term commitment to care that you don’t plan on. 

This is a highly contagious infection that we can prevent with masks, hand washing and socially distancing. All are cheap, readily available and easy to do. If I can wear a mask all day, why can’t you wear one to the store?"
2020-07-26 18:04:56,"In my apartment complex someone removed the sign in the elevator saying that masks are required.

2020-07-26 18:48:25,"This story is so real, so visceral, and so profoundly important. Because it illustrates the necessity of wearing masks to prevent situations like this family found themselves in (and through no fault of their own). Now the entire family is battling the virus.

It's not rocket science. Don't be an unsuspecting spreader. If you give the virus to someone else, odds are they're going to bring it home to their loved ones. Consider people. Wearing masks has been proven to reduce transmission by over 30%, which matters, since we might have the virus and not know we have it. Play it safe Texas. Be a part of the solution and not the problem."
2020-07-26 18:07:47,"What a story this is- I'm very grateful to read it. 

 Yesterday, my son and I had a long conversation about whether he will be visiting me this summer in NH.  He lives in LA and has been inside his apartment since March, working from home.

  He wishes he could hop on a plane and enjoy the summer here in the Lakes Region with us, but he is extremely fearful of catching it on the plane or the terminal and passing it on to me.  I believe the chances are low, but my son said if he caught it and gave it to me, he could never forgive himself.   After much discussion, I am very sad that I won't be seeing him for quite a while, his last trip being last summer.

  My town has had no hospital cases, 2 cases total since March, and we live in a 'bubble' here.  Seeing the photos of this family has shaken me to realize I really cannot take any chances. 

 Thank you."

This disease frightens me.  People are so cavalier with a virus that does so many terrible and strange things to our bodies.  I don't want to get it and then face a long convalescence and I don't want to die from it.

I so miss my friends, a close circle of women friends, and we just lost one of our own and yet all we can do is talk on the computer or phone.  I want to be with them.  But I don't want this illness.

My brother in Ohio, a smart businessman, says he won't wear a mask.  I haven't communicated with him in weeks since he told me that.  I don't know what to say to him.  

This would be easier to deal with if we had federal leadership.  But we don't.  We need to lockdown for at least six weeks.  The virus must be stopped before any other steps are taken.  While locked down there must be extensive planning on climbing out of the hole.

Instead of a single, simple message starting with Trump and on down - we have to shut down for 8 weeks.  We will provide economic support.  You must wear a mask.  We can control this.  NO - it was all over the board, from ""it's just going to disappear"" to the Lt. Gov of Texas proclaiming we have the obligation to die for the business community.

Most of us have grandparents, have friends or family who are “high risk”, or, we likely have people who don’t even know they’re high risk in our social orbits.

Here’s a question for those who believe wearing a mask is political.  If you knew wearing a mask would prevent your dog from dying or your spouse from dying, would you do it?

However, that does not necessarily mean that going forward, the Trump Administration’s approach to Covid19 is not the one that makes the best out of a very bad situation.

The Trump Administration has made it clear that shutting down the country again is not an option, regardless of the number of Covid-19 cases or deaths from now on. At this point, for America, this “don’t let the cure be worse than the disease” approach may be the only one practical. Given America’s size and the wide variation in the inclinations and attitudes towards Covid-19 held by public officials in America, now attempting to emulate those countries that used science at the beginning of the pandemic, may not be possible anymore.

Estimates of the fatality rate for Covid-19 for are tending to converge around 0.5–1%. At that level, many businesses in America can get back to close to their pre-pandemic revenues, with Covid-19 still a risk, but not an unacceptable risk for most activities. Airlines are not in that category...""

As far as I'm concerned, the book is still open on the mask issue. A lot of people seem to think that they don't do a lot. Most of the people here in California wear masks in public. We're still seeing a jump in cases. What's seemed to work best so far is distance. Isolation. But the American people just can't take it. We're too pampered. Too worried about our 'rights'. So, people like the Roberts are going to suffer for it."
2020-07-26 17:49:45,"The scandal of this whole pandemic is the lack of N95 quality masks. With that type of mask the family would not have been so dependent on whether someone else decided to protect themselves. It puts protection in the hands of the individual and not at the mercy of someone who doesn’t care. 

For a nation that spends billions advocating gun rights and private medical solutions the inability to produce and supply n95 masks for its citizens is nothing short of scandalous. 

Either you make everyone where a mask in confined spaces without exception and make it a crime (technically attempted murder when you think about it), or you give everyone who wants one an N95 mask. 

It is obviously far cheaper to provide the right PPE than to spend billions locking down the whole country."

Houston Methodist is making triage decisions that preclude or remove medical care from patients because of their overwhelmed system. 

Below the veneer of manifest destiny and exceptionalism, one finds a third world nation with a government and healthcare system failing scores of patients. What hospital must take ECMO off the table for want of staffing?

I'm incredulous, outraged, stunned. As reported:

""Coronavirus deaths across Methodist’s hospital system have multiplied, as they have elsewhere: 31 in May, 47 in June and 144 in the first three weeks of July.

Administrators have created I.C.U. after I.C.U. to tend to the growing number of severely ill patients who often require weeks of resource-intensive treatment. In recent days, doctors were told to stop offering a remedy used as a last resort — treatment with a heart-lung machine — to any more patients because staffing was too stretched... because so many patients were so severely sick, they had been forced to turn away some transfers from other institutions.

""I get desperate calls, desperate emails,"" Dr. Masud said. ""I have to make the call as to who can come and not come in. That’s a huge burden, because in my heart, with my saying no, they will more than likely end up dying.”

The GOP has gilded the pockets of a few and harmed tens of thousands. Shameful. Criminal."
2020-07-26 18:17:19,"People not wearing masks in grocery stores and the HVAC system blowing everything around all day is a recipe for disaster. I was in the grocery store right after the mask order was issued in my area. I was in line, mask on, and felt ice cold air blowing in my face. My eyes were not protected. I looked up, and saw a filthy HVAC register blowing right into my face. That day, I went to another line. When I got home, I wrote a letter to the manager of the store. They've since cleaned the system, but now, I wear a face shield in addition to the mask when I go to the grocery store. People working there are risking their lives every day so that we can have food on our tables. I wish more people would consider that."

Use of masks in public places should have been ordered months ago. Masks are hardly an amulet expected to perform over the warranty they deserve, but a tool, a medical device for which universal compliance and instruction on proper use give best results. We need every tool we can get while some of us have chances to dodge this virus. It may be too late if infection rates get high enough."

Principles like the “common good” and the promotion of “the general welfare” (from the Preamble of the Constitution) have have been overtaken by greed, narcissism, and a “me first and me only” attitude that has made the US incapable of managing this public health crisis.  In the same sermon in which John Winthrop, first governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony, spoke of the colony as a “city on a hill,” he also emphasized the need for the colonists to work together, to care for each other, and to “abridge ourselves of the superfluities, for the supply of other’s necessities.”

When ALL of this is over, IF people, ordinary folk and policymakers

I must also add, though, that I do wonder how diligent Randall’s and it’s parent company Albertson’s has been in enforcing mask policies company-wide. I have stopped doing most of my shopping at their stores in Austin as many of the employees that I see do not wear masks. My previous attempts to clarify  Randall’s mask policy with store management in Westlake were stonewalled by customer service representatives who were not wearing masks and could not clearly explain what their mask policy was. I was briefly in one of their central Austin stores yesterday and saw one employee strolling down the aisle without a mask while puffing on an e-cig. It’s unconscionable."
2020-07-26 19:19:03,"What many miss about masks is they are best for SOURCE CONTROL. Even informal masks made of 2 layers of cloth can stop droplets and finer particles effectively.

If you wear a cloth mask around people who are not wearing them, you have SOME protection but not nearly as much as with an N95 mask.

This REALLY matters because viral shedding peaks before symptoms show.

YOU can do the right thing but if you are around others who do not, you are still at risk.

This is why politicians who resist mask mandates are really irresponsible.

The virus has no ideology. Its logic is what counts, not our predilections."

For those people who decline masks for the sake of ""freedom"" or the right to ""choose,"" they should understand that they may condemning their family members, neighbors and even complete strangers to severe sickness, possibly death and huge medical bills. 

The unmasked should also know that they are prolonging this pandemic by not keeping their possible Covid germs to themselves. It is not a matter of ""choice"", it is a matter of public health. Once individuals lose confidence in the safety of out of home spaces and the capacity of government to implement effective plans for safety, those who can, will just stay home and the rest of us will stay home as much as possible. And that is an algorithm for economic stagnation and regression."

This Corona Virus situation seems a lot like that except that it isn’t a game, there are too many players who put themselves above the team, and right now our team isn’t doing very well."

Even though my city has mandated masks in public places, you risk being verbally attacked if you wear one around the wrong people. This week, I put on a mask before taking a walk alone in the park near my home. A couple ran up to me and shouted in my face—“What’s wrong, lady? Are you scared?” Shaken, I turned and went in a different direction. But I felt shaken and violated. By invading my space and intentionally exhaling into my face, these people had threatened me with a weapon every bit as deadly as a gun. And yet they laughed as if it was a funny joke. What happened to me might have been an isolated incident—my family has tried to reassure me that it was—but now every time I put on the mask, I remember the hate directed towards me for wearing it."

I don't care about your sensibilities - America is failing right now, and here's why.

In Zhengzhou China, where I live right now - which is now totally open - on Feb. 5 all supermarkets, buses, subways, trains, air travel, pharmacies, everything but one small general grocer was shut down for 2 months with only 2 women who LIVED THERE. Literally. I saw their sleeping bags.

You didn't lock down. Supermarkets and buses and subways? I saw  these photos in March and I knew America was doomed. You were too greedy,  America. And you are paying the price."

Don't inundate me with excuses. I've heard them all a hundred times. I despair for the stunning lack of intellect and empathy among a large portion of the American population. 

I don't want to hear from what one of my friends called the ""mask holes"" and Covid deniers anymore - the ones who carry rifles into a store and threaten to shoot 17 year old kids who ask them to mask up. They are not worthy of my, or anyone's, attention. Hire door bouncers, who might need a job. Deny the maskholes entrance. Let them stay home in all their mask-less glory.

My Uncle was just released from the hospital in Corpus Christi. Like many Texans described in this article, he had been somewhat casual about Covid 19. He is not casual now. 
The hospitals in Texas are so full the ER almost sent him home alone with an oxygen tank until an ICU bed opened up.
New Mexico despite having a Governor who acted early to keep our cases and Infection rate low compared to our immediate neighbors to the east and west whose Governors took the pandemic far less seriously, we are now in the position of having our much smaller number of hospital beds filling up with patients from Texas and Arizona. So we can’t afford to get sick as there may be no beds left for us. Yet some here of a certain political persuasion call our Governors mask order and other public health orders an “infringement of their rights and the Constitution.”

It seems to me that shoving Dr Fauci into the barn and stuffing a virtual gag in his mouth; while blathering nonsense at warp speed,  Trump has been more then negligent: it will go away like a miracle, I won't wear a mask because it would make the press happy, Liberate Michigan, saying the federal emergency stockpile was empty and he is not a delivery service for PPE,  putting Jared in charge of  covid equipment/testing procurement, and so on, ad nauseam. All this has directly contributed to the horrible situation we now have in the entire USA. Someone has to do something to hold Trump accountable for this catastrophe."
2020-07-26 21:01:56,"The spread has slowed in New York. Is that because people are wearing masks? Doubtful. People here are parting just as much as elsewhere. The virus ripped though the population and that is why the spread is down here. Same as Europe and Wuhan. It is not policy or individual behavior that is the biggest factor influencing current spread but rather the rate at which the virus has already penetrated the population. An inconvenient truth, but a truth nonetheless. Sorry if it doesn’t fit within your “blue states good, red states bad” narrative!"

Like a lot of things from Corporate America - once the glowing pronouncements are made, that is the extent of commitment.

2020-07-26 20:59:40,"There's a bell curve to everything, including whether people will be inconsistent about PPE in a pandemic, or not bother at all. But the curve CAN be shifted rightward. That's the role of leadership (the kind that's the opposite of selfishness). Think about Mr. Trump's position on mask wearing - at first scornful, now barely ""yeah-sure-whatever."" That stance, aped by Mr. Abbott and various other selfishly mindless political acolytes,  is predicated on calculations about what will play most favorably in voters' minds, not conclusions on what would maximize public health. Only gaslighters can deny that. 

But many in the big middle of that bell curve look to - depend on - leadership for guidance. That's a fundamental responsibility of the public executive's job.

When a bus crashes because the driver is texting, that person is fully culpable for the consequences. Don't public executives have even greater responsibility? These self-centered devotees of power have never had their eyes on the road, but rather on their own prospects. Their behavior in this pandemic could be called public-executive malpractice. In fact, I think it's negligent homicide."

While these victims do not have the resources to understand the seriousness of the pandemic, others do. Public officials who minimize this health crisis, business owners who do not enforce their own requirements and those who purposefully choose not to wear masks have a lot of blood on their hands. It’s simply inexcusable."

When you see someone not wearing a mask, it's an insult to everyone who cares about their fellow Americans and wears a mask to show respect for their lives as well as their own.  

Wearing a mask is such a simple thing. It's not even as scary as donating our blood. We donate our blood to help those who need it. We save lives by donating our blood. Not wearing a mask is disrespectful and dangerous to others, it could very well cost lives. It's as simple as that imo.

Even a mask mandate in Houston or by the store earlier wouldn’t have completely protected the parents.

Sheryl Roberts, a retired nurse, clearly did not understand the perils of the pandemic, and was misguided to think that by isolating themselves, she and her husband, both with underlying medical conditions, would not become infected. Why did they allow their daughter, who lives at home, to work in an unsafe environment, in close proximity with unmasked shoppers? Were the parents unaware that their daughter could infect the parents if she became infected?

Staying home is an important way for all of us to minimize our risk of infection, and passing the infection to others. A little common sense goes a long way."

If the Robert's family had been like many families that have fallen victim then it is a familiar story that is no longer news worthy. Patience is wearing thin for those with cavalier attitude towards effort to ward of COVID-19 but instead spreading it around. 

There is more Americans can do to stay healthy and be ready to ward off any infection and fight non communicable diseases.

1) An advice from Prime minister of Britain Boris Johnson is lose weight. Easier said than done and gets harder as one grows older but try hard anyway and get professional help if needed and also try not to gain weight which can be easier.

2) Eat a balanced protein rich diet with less saturated fat and sugars and ensure that there is a high fiber intake.

3) Make sure you have are current with all immunizations. The seasonal flu vaccine is making its way to the USA. Try to be the first in line for it. No telling how quickly it may disappear from pharmacies in Europe. It will NOT protect against COVID-19 but one less deadly infection to worry about.

4) If you are about to travel to a country that has still not closed its doors on visitors from America then make sure you check the CDC-gov website for International travel. Also plan on ways to survive foreign quarantines."

A month later, the ICU was full of all the service workers, many of them Latinx, who got sick because the customers would not wear masks.  I attribute these deaths directly to Gov. Abbott's orders and the abysmal failure of leadership.  Don't think this family is an aberration.  This story played out again and again where whole families get sick and many die.  Now our patients are younger and younger.  Just because we have the physical space to put ICU beds (unlike NYC, we are not in tents) does not mean that we have the healthcare workers or equipment.  There was nothing more horrifying than having patients shipped from Houston having run out of oxygen along the way because their ventilatory needs were so high.  There's nothing like working in an ICU where you've just got one ventilator left in the whole hospital and worrying that someone will be intubated - and then what?  There's nothing like having patients drop dead because they thought they were okay, got up to go to the bathroom and accidentally pulled out their high flow nasal canula and dropped dead.

You follow those fancy elite scientists, and you still get COVID!  See?""

My advance reply to these people is, that no, doing the ""right things"" will not guarantee your safety --  but it will guarantee that your chances of getting COVID are significantly reduced, as are your chances of spreading it (a moral concern that I realize doesn't resonate well in Trump-world).  Hypothetically, among 100 people who all do the ""right things,"" one could still get COVID, because that's how nature and chance are; and that one person might well complain about how ""I did all the right things, and I still got sick.""  But what that person might fail to notice is that the other 99 also did the right things, and came through all right.

2020-07-27 00:17:56,"Interesting that The Right feared that Obamacare was going to create “death squads” which would determine who lived and who died. 

Obamacare didn’t, of course, create those, but, with trump at the lead, The Right’s no mask mandates and denial of the virus, have created such a storm of death and illness with the pandemic that healthcare workers are being put in that position. To wit:

“Dr. Masud said, ‘I have to make the call as to who can come and not come in. That’s a huge burden, because in my heart, with my saying no, they will more than likely end up dying.’”

This falls right inline with The Right’s other Obama “nightmares” they ranted about, which never came to pass - until trump got elected. 

For example, the federal government sending in troops to take over local government and create a police state, depriving citizens of Constitutional rights with gestapo tactics was one recurring claim The Right used to promote gun sales and pseudo-militia gangs. Never happened under Obama, but is now in Portland.

Indeed, under trump, the party of”Hell, no!” has become the party of “Hell, Yes!” embracing federal control over state and local government, taking a strong inherited economy and throwing it in the toilet, making the US a fourth string country on the world stage, and, through willful ignorance, taking an unconscionable toll of American lives.

Even though they did everything they can do to prevent the virus by wearing masks and wearing gloves, it doesn't make you 100% safe from the virus. People still have a chance to get it even though the rate of getting the virus with the mask is dramatically lower than not wearing it. It is just so unfortunate for the Roberts family.

The article focused on community spread. So does most of the news. But most of the contagion has different causes. 

Here, Elaine was working a high risk job, coming into contact with hundreds of strangers daily. Had they all worn masks she still would have been high risk. But because of her age and health, the risk would normally have been acceptable. 

But everything turns on the salient fact, the game changer, which was that Emily lived with two elderly and vulnerable parents. 

Emily’s likely transmission rate was 2, almost twice the national average.  And the two she stood to infect were both very high risk, unreasonably high. 

Simply stated, Emily’s risk level was much too high for anyone doing the job she was doing. If she weren’t autistic, I would blame her. As it stands, I put the onus on the supermarket which should have forced to her leave, and which would have qualified her for generous unemployment benefits. 

The moral I take from the story is that we are way too focused on community spread, and not nearly enough on family spread and the other means of spread that account for the vast majority of cases.  You could change Emily’s circumstances or change the behavior of millions of Texans. Changing both would have been best. But in a pinch, you get Emily out of the supermarket."

Which countries shut the virus down and how:  South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan.....and Germany.  With immediate and massive testing, contact tracing, quarantine/treatment.  Citizens all masked up, social distanced, followed basic hygiene.

Asian countries lived thru SARS and MERS....they learned, they knew, they were prepared: both scientists and citizens.

BUT, being the “exceptional” Americans that we are, we turned down the 1.7 BL tests that South Korea offered us.....we’ll create our own!

And it was politicized and went downhill from there....utterly shameful and inexcusable.

I couldn’t imagine myself being able to live amongst so many selfish people, unwilling to do the right thing by each other. 
When Trump was elected I assumed they voted for him unknowingly. Getting sucked into the show of a businessman and part-celebrity shaking up Washington. 
Now almost four years have gone by and he and his party have been exposed over and over again and yet we still see so many mini Trumps in your society. 3 or 4 in every ten people. Thats an enormous percentage of your population who the other 6 or 7 people need to live with, work alongside and deal with every day. And endure the next crisis together with!
These people weren’t made by Trump, just emboldened, and they’re not going to magically turn into good people after November. So while all decent human beings can hope Trump is gone after November, his people will still be there amongst you. 
And that is truly scaring."

When owners and executives knowingly expose their workers and their families to COVID-19, they should be jailed with no appeal! Prosecutors please start prosecuting them. 

Company boards need to do the right thing and eliminate executive bonuses based on sales while COVID-19 is here. Management should lose financial incentives that make them expose their workers to COVID-19."

As bad as it is, it could have been much worse, think if we had 3 more years rather than 15X days of this Admin.

Still, we must accept that we have to embrace a changing Set of Right Things To Do. The results out of Asia showed that wearing Masks was ""a"" right thing to do. With masks alone, they had contained it. Europe added social distancing with less reliance on masks. They got bad results until masks were explicitly added and then the results chained in direct proportion to mask usage at large. The US led in the contrarian dialogue against masks. They also added gloves use but primarily for Health Care staff.

With new data, we have found that the virus is also found in aerosol droplets which can linger so taking our masks off is no longer feasible though a room/area is now empty of others. To deal with this, we add the face shield, preferably with a visor allowing full face wraparound protection.

The List of Evolved “Right Things To Do”:
1. Social Distancing - 1M+ OK, 2M+ 50% better
2. Good Face Mask with wire over nose & worn over mouth AND nose.
3. Full Face Shield with tight visor, especially when distancing is below 2M.
4. Washing Hand Frequently, wearing gloves and touching very little with bare hands.

This is not any official guideline, just a common sense collection of things that have been working. There are No Guarantees."

Ms. Roberts has true courage. To work all those years with such challenges, and now through this pandemic, is something special. To think that the fools in leadership positions, be it the governor, mayor, president, cdc, who, the ownership of Randall’s, and China too, were so negligent, and that people like the Roberts have suffered as a result, is simply sickening.  Why employees had to wear masks, but customers did not have to wear masks just shameful.

One more point. I also think this story resonated because it left out the obvious political statements by the journalist.  Any thoughtful reader could see the rights and wrongs here. The mark of a good journalist.

2020-07-27 06:30:16,"This is a most distressing story. My heartfelt wishes for their well being. Perhaps a group of well meaning scientists and doctors could put together a clear set of instructions on how to use masks and gloves. Folks who work in department, grocery stores and other places of work, should ideally change their masks after a time. Especially if they remove it and place it back on. Most infection transfers happen when masks are removed and the contaminated outer surface of the mask is touched and then contacts the mouth, nose or eyes. People need to be given breaks every so often from masks. No one should be expected to remain behind a mask continuously for very long periods of time. Gloves prevent contamination from touching fingers but the surface of the glove will retain germs for a long enough time, so contact with your face should be avoided. 
If only fellow citizens considered how their stubborn demand for freedom can make them unwittingly cruel to their neighbors, friends and community at large. A little kindness will change our management of this disease. Please respect others. This is a new disease that is not well understood. Mask up when shopping."

2020-07-27 05:53:57,"It's harder to do all the right things all the time than is commonly imagined - even if you have no complicating circumstance as many people do. And if some how you manage to do it right, that is still only half the equation. 

How ironic for example that the wearing of a non-surgical mask does more to protect an irresponsible person not wearing any mask. Defeating the virus clearly necessitates a symbiotic relationship between each of us and each of the people with whom we interact. 

The fact Americans have warmed - albeit slowly - to the cautionary COVID culture is not down to leadership. Not only have their leaders - and their president in particular - failed to show any, but indeed they have worked actively, tirelessly to diminish the seriousness of the threat. For months COVID was cast as a leftist media ruse. The message from the top was that people should carry on as if it didn't exist.

Many followed that advice - at least until the numbers were so overwhelmingly that even hard-core supporters had to come to grips with reality. Trump's deliberate misdirection has extracted an enormous human and economic cost. The country is consequentially facing a much greater crisis now than was necessary. 

For most of us, the weight of that responsibility would be unbearable. But narcissists are, by definition, incapable of empathy. In this case 'heavy is the head that wears the crown' does not apply."
2020-07-27 08:16:14,"We ought to demand some basic requirements from those who choose to run for office. In addition to verbal literacy, and the ability to count, these people ought to be able to show that not only have they studied basic science in school, but that they have sufficient cognitive ability to understand science.  Those governors who refused to accept science, who refused to make mask wearing mandatory, have led to thousands upon thousands of people suffering terribly from this illness, and countless unnecessary deaths. As in NYC, many frontline workers will suffer psychologically from the suffering they have tried to alleviate. The willful ignorance of those in leadership positions makes them guilty of murder."

2020-07-27 03:40:29,"If only it were as simple as wear a mask!!  Not all masks are created equal...  I have the supposedly three layer surgical masls -- but according to me... they are in fact two-layerI have been doubling them for awhile now... BECAUSE FINALLY it has been documented that masks do protect the person wearing them as well as others.

Along with wear a mask, we need speak softly  and ... yes observe hygiene  -- wash hands and IMO face as well...   

We still know so little. We also know enough sleep and does nutrition matter... and what?? and exercise??  

The big problem with COVID is the aftermath   when off the ventilator.  I would like the Times to do an article detailing what the post ""active disease?"" recovery consists of.  Is there PT and OT?  I have had nursing home care post knee surgery -- the food was so awful I could not eat it.  And sometimes roomates would have the TV on and loud at all hours.  Plus the hosptial does all of its various checks, when you are reawoken and you just wish you were left alone to sleep.  I could not have managed at home alone, and had a mild fever, but there were HUGE problems with the so called care.   I was well enough that it didn''t matter and losing the ten lbs or so was also OK... but had I lost much more weight or had much less sleep.... it would not have been good.. and I did get released at 7-10 days.

About 100 people in the community came and no one was wearing a mask.  I was not present, but I heard about it from others.  It seems that many in that community have moved on from Covid-19.  They simply don’t/won’t wear masks or socially distance.  

The horror and fury I feel is immense.  What can they possibly be thinking?  That community lost a great many people to the virus.  Why, as New York begins to recover from devastation, would these people behave in such an ignorant and careless way.  It’s mind-boggling. 

I have such sympathy for the Roberts family.  Supermarket employees are frontline workers.  We owe them a debt of gratitude.  They should be treated with care and every single customer should give them the respect of wearing a mask."

However, after their big, splashy announcement that they would now ""require"" masks followed by the heartstring tugging commercials now airing, I thought that at least they were doing the right thing-obviously ahead of the President and our governor.

Then over the weekend I read that they, along with other retail establishments, would not enforce their own mask mandate.   Seriously?   Locally we have a county and citywide mask mandate, but when stores refuse to enforce, you quickly realize that all their so called requirements were nothing more than one giant publicity stunt!   The shrugging,  non enforcement should also worry any parent considering whether or not to allow their child to return to school.   Just how stringent will mask policies actually be, and will they be strictly enforced?     As a retired educator who has long dealt with  the ""schools as daycare facilities"" mindset I think I know the answer.   That answer should terrify all parents, as we see how easily this horrible virus can come home and spread throughout a family!"

For people who lives in both states where they get hit by hurricanes --as happening in Corpus Christi now- you would think seeing how New York state had 900 deaths a  day during March and April would be similar to a satellite imagery that a covid hurricane is heading their way. But no! They are arrogant and many will die.  Mr. Robert's daughter should have been in quarantine and not give the virus to her elderly parents. She recovered but they are still paying a high price. Contact tracers would or should have told her that she has to be in quarantine away from other people for 14 days. I guess they got no contact tracing in Texas!

They clean, they bag, they hustle carts, and they smile  and always have a pleasant word when they are directly addressed. One of them, because of staff shortages during the pandemic, was recently promoted from bagger to check-out staff, and he's doing a great job. 
There is so much capability held by so many of whom we expect much less. Sometimes it takes the hardest of circumstances for them to have the chance to shine.

Go, Elaine!
And my hopes and best wishes go out to all the Roberts family!
May Paul and Sheryl's ""deal"" be kept!"

2020-07-24 17:54:28,"FEMA Sends Faulty Protective Gear to Nursing Homes Battling Virus
By. Andrew Jacobs
Its sad that the nurses from the nursing home found most boxes opened. We are trying to protect our elders but how we can do it if the government are the first ones to send items that could possibly be contagious with the virus. FEMA is supposed to help and give new items not used ones. In the other hand they need to investigate any employees that could also be the ones doing such things."
2020-07-24 18:02:52,"To be honest the isolation gown pictured looks exactly like what we currently use (I’m a hospital physician).  Not meant to be fashion statements, often used for a minute or less.   Fashionable?  No.  Functional?  Yes.  All about expectations..."
2020-07-24 18:12:33,The contractor's political connections should be investigated. There should also be an audit of their billing.
2020-07-24 18:21:44,"""The Trump administration’s largely hands-off approach to personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., has forced states, cities and big hospital chains to compete for limited supplies, leaving nursing homes at a disadvantage as prices have soared.""

Maybe that was trump's plan all along - to let companies take advantage of the pandemic to increase profits.  It's the American way.  Or perhaps it is just his blind support for the
free enterprise system, even in situations like calamities when it fosters high prices for consumers and big profits for corporations."
2020-07-24 18:24:49,"They just don't care. the message has been sent many times since February, but maybe now it's getting through. The federal administration has no interest in anything but moving old and faulty merchandise at government expense (and maybe getting something for their ""effort""?)"
2020-07-24 18:25:35,"I would love to know where these PPE items were made?  Also, I wonder if payment was made for non-usable items."
2020-07-24 18:30:42,"What is the origin of this equipment, Canada had received PPE from China, we returned it as it did not meet Canadian Standards. We like the US have had many challenges in our Nursing Home facilities, it is disgraceful to think that seniors who have contributed so much to society and experienced some of the worst events in their lifetime find themselves in conditions that are intolerable, it is as if they are disposable humans, and they are not, many of these areas are also serviced by minority groups, they also have the right to feel protected at all times, Hopefully, this has been an unfortunate oversight by FEMA and the Trump Administration."
2020-07-24 18:03:46,Some friend of a Trump donor has made millions selling substandard PPE to the federal government but there is no one to inspect or audit any of this because our grifting administration isn’t about helping people it is about helping themselves.
2020-07-24 18:21:38,"But someone got paid. And someone else probably got paid off.

Curious as to whether the current FEMA Director, Gaynor, had any say over this - he seems to have decent credentials for the job."
2020-07-24 18:34:37,"Clearly Trump, Pence and the entire appointed leadership of the current White House care only about political talking points and nothing about the health or welfare of the American people."
2020-07-24 17:48:31,"If all of the federal government's goof-ups across multiple departments and divisions occurred in a corporation, heads would have rolled a long time ago. And, to have the head of  that private corporation declare he took no responsibility for any that would have landed him out on his ear as well. 

With every passing day, it becomes increasingly and painfully obvious that Trump never reported to a Board of Directors."
2020-07-24 18:09:35,"I don't get it. If the Govt is going to fund a department that, in this case, is supposed to respond to any major emergency across the country then fund it properly and put competent people in charge. Anything less is an embarassment and a waste of taxpayer $$$. But FEMA has been down this road before."
2020-07-24 18:17:11,"POTUS now believes in masks, social distancing and other things to protect people from this virus.  I would say he is a little bit slow since help really was needed at the beginning of the pandemic not 6 months later.  But the worst part of this I have found the moment is so he can get re-elected.  If he had better poll numbers he still would be avoiding the elephant in the room.  He reads from scripted statements in a slow monotone void that even that is painful to listen to.  Imagine if we had a President at the beginning working together with the CDC and others instead of ""it will just disappear"".  I think we would have been better off."

2020-07-24 17:57:25,"Who profits?  Someone, somewhere choose these items, identified them (more or less...) and sent them on to the nursing homes.  Is it just incompetence?  How high in the supply line does incompetence go?  Who will take responsibility?"
2020-07-24 18:22:42,"Heckuva job, Brownie!"
2020-07-24 18:47:17,"The nursing industry is Big Business and takes millions if not billions of dollars from Medicaid and Medicare. Nursing Home costs is may in fact be the #1 drain on Governmental healthcare. I never want to go to a nursing ""home"", any reasonable person would not. But, for many not any other option.The nursing home industry owners, profiteers, are businesses to make money that is the bottom line. The owners need to make the expenditures from the abundant profits and purchase what their employees and residents need. They can afford it. The taxpayers should not be bailing them out."
2020-07-24 17:51:59,"I guess the death panels that the GOP was screeching about equate with the worthless PPE sent to nursing homes. Fits their death panel goals to hurt our most vulnerable.

2020-07-24 18:04:55,"This isn’t a bug, it’s a feature. Several features actually. Companies dump useless items and get big bucks from taxpayers. More nursing home residents die, so the government can shift their social security payments to tax cuts for the rich. And if those who care for those residents die, well, they are mostly black and brown people and/or illegals and who cares about them anyway?"

2020-07-24 18:28:02,"can this administration do anything other than make errors? well, yes, they can roll back environmental protection laws; pardon felons engaged in election interference; violate human rights laws; antagonize our allies with unnecessary bellicosity; separate and imprison migrant children from their parents; engage in juvenile 'culture' wars; turn a 'blind' eye when russia pays the taliban a 'bounty' to kill our armed forces personnel in the theatres of the middle east; and lie, and play 'what about him / her' when caught in their moronic pantomimes of how to govern. oh, one last one: they certainly know how to cut taxes for the wealthiest 1%."

2020-07-24 18:14:22,"I keep feeling this all to be 'on purpose' .... and I can hardly believe that. But when you read the statistics and the folks that seem to be getting 'wiped out' by this virus - all makes me wonder, why them and why so many at once? Them being elderly, and minorities. Just makes me wonder and there are no immediate answers here, but really? How do we handle such terrible oversight in this situation? There are so many that do care and are vigilant. It's this type of stupidity that makes me wonder...."

Lysol can ship 5,000 bottles of toilet bowl cleaner a week to Target stores but not one bottle of Lysol disinfectant spray.  3M can ship ten thousand N-95 masks a day to Europe, but not one has been delivered to a Home Depot since March.  Surely the process of making masks and gowns can be automated to produce a much better product than Chinese manufacturers."
2020-07-24 18:34:20,"This is shameful.  Our tax dollars being spent on junk.  And this ""equipment"" is supposed to be used to protect healthcare workers and others in a vulnerable population.

Kushner (remember how he talked about “our” supplies?) has given huge contracts to Trump cronies to produce or procure substandard supplies, with deliveries of the closed boxes done by Pence as window dressing to fool the American people into thinking there’s an adequate response.

The corruption coming out of the White House in less than four years is simply overwhelming and unprecedented in our history.  It will take decades to clean up this mess and that assumes the right people are put into office."

No transparency, accountability, or integrity. And copious amounts of ick."
2020-07-24 19:18:03,So how could FEMA have bought these types of things?  Isn't there a spec for these purchases?  Someone in FEMA has to be familiar with the needs and the varieties in sizes and material that are needed.  A cynical people would say that these were purchased at a premium from friends of the president.  We are rapidly approaching the status that trump used to categorize some undeveloped countries.
2020-07-24 19:25:02,"There are plenty of surgical masks readily available at reasonable prices right now. One issue is many people who procure for nursing homes and hospitals refuse to use sources other than their historic vendors. Yes, Trump has made A mess of PPE, (in addition to everything else he touches) but right now since much of the world is doing just fine, thank you, masks are plentiful.

It's hard to believe that sending trash bag isolation gowns,
extra-small  surgical gloves  stuffed into baggies, etc, could be an accident.

 I have an idea.  Given the dangers of school re-openings, children could be placed in charge of  getting PPE to health care workers and others. My two year old  great-nephew gave me a tutorial on using an iPad.(which his aunt pretended to follow ).

No wonder Trump has called Putin 10 times since February, how else can he get properly tutored on Russian-style election procedures and the art of deploying Federal ""little green men"" to American cities, in a style like what took place in Ukraine."
2020-07-24 19:46:47,"Really, what did anyone expect from this government. Mike Pence delivering faulty PPE supplies - about as effective as “thoughts and prayers”."
2020-07-24 20:17:33,Extra-small gloves? Clearly Trump has his hands all over this.

2020-07-24 20:34:56,The incredibly sad reality of what has become of the once greatest country on Earth. The picture of the nurse in the blue “baggie” speaks volumes. The federal government has let all Americans down in the fight against this terrible virus.
2020-07-24 20:33:06,"'“We have received complaints on less than 1 percent of the total PPE shipments to nursing homes,” the statement said. “We continue to engage with nursing homes to keep lines of communication and feedback open at all times.”'

We continue to get statements from every branch of DHS including the top level that are blatant lies.  They lie about protective equipment.  They lie about the illegal policing by their camouflaged agents.  (Why camouflage in an American city, by the way?)  They lie about conditions at the border and in detention centers.  Will there be consequences to anyone for this?"
2020-07-24 20:35:47,"FEMA Officials who knew about the defective equipment in ADVANCE and did nothing about it and consequently one or more elders in nursing homes DIED  as a result should be charged, convicted and sentenced to line up against a wall and be SHOT. 

Point blank period."

Why is this not being investigated by the GAO?"
2020-07-24 20:58:46,"I took my mother out of a nursing home to save her life years ago. However, the accusation made in this article that the federal government is responsible for the deaths of nursing home patients is wrong. That is not the job of the federal government.  The responsibility to safeguard the health of patients is, and always has been, the responsibility of the facility operators. They are required to have contingency plans for response to an epidemic. That is their job. The state and local jurisdictions have the responsibility to enforce codes and requirements for facility operators. 
The facility where my mother was an inmate were short of gloves back in 2009. They didn’t hire enough people, had a high turnover of employees and over worked their employees. They fired anyone who complained. One nurse aid had to change the beds on one wing all by herself. The local news reported weeks ago that the same facility had 23 Covid deaths and more than 22 staff members were infected with the virus. Yet this same facility always passed all of their annual mandated health and safety inspections. One member of the board of the company that owned the facility was a former Louisiana governor, Dave Treen."
2020-07-24 21:00:23,"Does this trace back to Jared Kushner's involvement in sourcing PPE, by any chance? And where were these supplied manufactured?

These PPEs are not even useful enough to represent a 'token' effort; nursing homes' needs would now be seen as met, so these 'contributions' cause more harm than good. However, some big corporations' will surely benefit by the charitable write-off."
2020-07-24 21:22:41,Wasn't FEMA and Homeland Security funding merged under the Bush Administration?  There is apparently very little left for emergencies and health crises.
2020-07-24 21:07:27,"Just another example of how Trump is ""draining the swap"" of all possible oversight and giving contracts to ""friends"" of the White House (Trump, Pence, and Kushner).

How much more do we, the citizens of this country have to take before Republican Governors, Mayors, State and Federal Legislators do something!!"
2020-07-24 20:47:12,"These gowns with no hand holes do remind me of something: detassling corn during my youth, in central Illinois.  You started at 5 am and fields were wet.  So we used garbage bags and poked our own armholes, to help from getting drenched.  But then the sun rose, and would get blistering hot, so off came the trash bags.  
Fine for the cornfields, not right in medical setting.  As you punch your arms through, much bigger hole than needed.  Not good in a nursing home.   
I would just think that nursing home staff would receive better than what I used, working in cornfields during the summer."
2020-07-24 21:21:09,"For the kind of public sector incompetence exemplified by FEMA, conservatives love to blame ""government."" No, don't blame ""government."" The fault is with THIS government.

As sad and frightening as the pandemic is, the reality of where our nation stands in the world is just as frightening. 
I'm scarred."
2020-07-24 21:03:41,"More than 40 percent of all coronavirus deaths are tied to nursing homes. Could defective PPE be part of the problem? The answer to that is a resounding _yes_. What a disgrace. The ""hands off"" reaction of Mr. Trump in regard to the upkeep of PPE for first responders and health professionals is pretty much a shrug.

Look, there's Mike Pence in May without a mask pushing a boxload of potentially defective PPE. What happens when a nurse takes care of someone with this sort of shoddy equipment?"
2020-07-24 20:57:11,"...let me count the ways: the USA went from having hundreds of CSC Scientists in China to only 14 to save money, there was a detailed plan for responding to a pandemic left by the Obama Administration that was trashed, when the crisis hit Jarred and his Frat Brothers took it upon themselves to ""source PPE"" with no oversight or planning based on the business concept of"" ""I know a guy..."" the Trump administration decimated and demoralized long serving (and suffering) federal employees who knew what they were doing and how to do it and replace them with Trump Loyalists because they ""know a guy named Trump."" 

It's all a game show, nothing is real, governing is as easy as making a reality TV episode so what is that problem? We're all seen that show where they give people boxes of stuff and they have to figure out how to use it to make something that works. 

The real problem is: ""We-the-People"" who want to be entertained, who want solutions that come in sound bytes, that want to deal with symptoms of problems while avoiding the root-causes, a president who does everything and allows us to do nothing. 

Well, we have the entertainer in chief who hogs center stage like any hammy actor. It's all about ratings and perception - who cares about substance. 

The reality is that this is not a nation of One-Man-Rule and it takes all of us working together to solve the root-causes of problems through considered compromise."
2020-07-24 19:45:38,Let us pray that our children fare better in their institutions. Our ability to plan is only superceded by our ability to execute but maybe the agents from homeland security and their leader Chad will care. They were just old anarchists who deserve their fate.

2020-07-24 20:54:52,"Just wait until hurricane season really gets revved up next month, and the storms are slamming into Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama..., and FEMA and the Meteorologist in Chief are more lost and dazed than they are now, and they're drawing crazy lines all over maps with magic markers and claiming the hurricanes (like Covid) are fake news while hospitals along the coasts are being hit by the storms, and the water is rising, and.... If the Republicans in the Senate, who gave us this, cared a whit about the country they'd do an intervention and get the Incompetent One to fake an illness and leave office. He could then go play golf, which is what he's doing this weekend anyway. I think it would even be good for the Republicans politically, show some resolve and sanity."

Of course, is what they are doing  crooked or just monumental honest incompetence?"

The health care workers are collateral damage .

I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but it's hard to believe  that every single person who was involved up until the point when all this defective PPE reached the nursing homes  could be so incompetent such that the result could be garbage bag ""surgical gowns"", tiny surgical gloves packed in baggies,  and so forth."

Do we not have enough manufacturing plants to do this?  People are not buying clothing and non-essential things very much these days.  Doing this could not only save countless lives, but also give American manufacturers a big, needed boost."

When he was a businessman, putting crucial responsibilities on the shoulders of hapless sycophants only affected his bottom line. Now that he's leader-of-the-free-world, it's a life-and-death issue. 

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, has been running a shadow coronavirus task force that was supposed to secure personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals and essential workers. 

It failed, mostly because it was comprised of business people with no experience in science or medicine."

I said I wanted to write to my Congress member about the gowns, but they asked me not to do so, because they were afraid that there would be repercussions if the report was traced back to them.  I don't know which is a bigger disgrace, the gowns or the climate of fear which has been created by this administration and its toadies.

A housekeeper who was unpacking the gowns happened to notice a label on the packages saying ""Not FDA approved"" - so much for the allegation that they meet Federal standards.  The facility's medical director shipped the back, so I guess they just got passed on to nursing homes instead."

I'm sure I don't need to remind you of the phrase trump used to describe certain countries whose people he wanted to keep out of the US. Well, that's exactly what he's made America. It's horrifying and shameful. We'll see in November if it's also inspirational."

The bitter irony is that these people are more likely to infect the residents by their carelessness, than to help them with these dubious supplies. Remember; you don't have to be sick to spread the virus to others. But anything for a photo-op!

That is how far they are removed from reality.  These are, most likely, the very same people who do not ""believe"" in wearing masks.  Some of the other humanoids involved in this ""supply chain"" must be pure sociopaths who care about nothing aside from money.  Whoever dies, whoever lives - it is all meaningless to them, just another scratch on an old piece of furniture.  The furniture are human beings, you and me.  They don't see it that way.

Instead of contracting directly with manufacturers like 3M for the best quality PPE, private companies with ties to this administration  get federal contracts with no oversight.

Then FEMA buys the same stock back at inflated prices. Could it be Trump only sees the coronavirus pandemic as a way to enrich a bunch of profiteers."

The good news for the country is that  your political career will be all but over once the voters have come to recognize that you have nothing of value to offer to the common good.

2020-07-24 23:09:52,"It's pretty simple. Trump and his ilk are trying to kill off the elderly  and vulnerable who in their eyes are drag on society. Sending defective gear, is just another malevolent act like sending border patrol goons."

Jared Kushner? Pence? DeVoss? Fox News? Deranged white guys in camo carrying assault guns and ready to scream if asked to wear a mask? And THIS now? More greedy slimeballs making a buck off the lives of the vulnerable. Are we all crazy? Are we this shallow and selfish? I weep for the loss of what could be a decent country. We are, I fear,  done."
2020-07-24 22:37:24,"If they didn’t knowingly send faulty equipment, I’m sure they’ll fix it.  If they did, they’ll still fix it, but it makes the administration appear to have taken the Obama death squad accusations to heart."
2020-07-24 23:28:08,But...but...but...aren't these supplies coming from Jared's personal sources. I recall him taking ownership in the government's PPE stores earlier this year. Looks like he knows as much about PPE as he does about mideast peace or the organization of the Covid-19 response. It's amazing how thin the administration has managed to spread Jared's veneer of gross incompetence. Too bad this veneer can't even be managed to take a polish. Lucky us.

2020-07-25 02:12:12,"Profits over actually protecting people with legitimate PPE. Is anyone really surprised? The Administration pretends it is actually leading a coordinated federal response, but it's too little, too late, and poorly managed. And he's only pretending to care now since his poll numbers are tanking and his advisers have prevailed upon him to read statements that sound more reasonable. Anyone else notice how little enthusiasm the President has for reading these words? His empathy tank is empty, and has always been so. 

So many are dying in nursing homes, other long-term care facilities and in prisons and jails. The measure of our nation's greatness is not a rising stock market or muscular military, but in how we protect and care for the most vulnerable. So far, we have a failing grade. I am confident we can do much better, but this will require leadership at all levels and an end to the political sniping. Here's hoping for the best."

The smartest president in the world can't evoke war act that would require our own factories to make the PPE equipment so badly needed to protect frontline workers and vulnerable populations. We are going to need PPE as the smartest president in the world demands schools reopen. And until there is a viable and effective vaccine (if that ever happens), there will be novel Corona virus present in all of our communities, which means we will continue to need appropriate PPE. This is NOT rocket science,

This administration has dragged its feet, denied covid-19 to be a problem and told states to get their own equipment for months.  The rot starts at the top.  Cronyism, favoritism, call it what you will, but the fact that this administration literally closed its pandemic response office says it all."
2020-07-25 16:25:51,"A study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that most of the deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico were after the fact, and 30 % were from an interruption in medical care, the elderly made up 77% of those deaths.
 Media coverage of the wildfires in CA, Hurricane Irma in FL, Katrina in LA etc, showed the horrific vulnerability of children, those with disabilities and the elderly when disaster strikes.
  After Katrina FEMA made changes to address their gaps in care for the disabled and elderly, however the Trump administration gutted those provisions and like the EPA, they turned FEMA's mandate on it's ear, to disaster mismanagement.

  FEMA used to deploy eldercare/disability advisors embedded in their forward incident management teams, 50-60 per disaster, by Hurricane Michael and Florence that number was knocked down to a couple of dozen and the partnership with the same such  organizations severed. 
  The GAO noted reports showed FEMA's policies for the elderly /disabled had become so unclear ground workers/managers did not know how to acvomodate them.
Hearings set up last year to address these issues were hamstrung when FEMA failed to  show.
  This is their response to the mandate to care for the elderly, and in the midst of another active hurricane season.

I've been looking at this for months now and the Farce Force are guilty of criminal malfeasance and this stupid photo is supposed to say to people...oh look Mikey Pence is rolling up his sleeves and doing something about the PPE situation. Oh and Alex Azar is there to lend a hand...for what? The Republican rush to cut big government may have played a role in the SNS fiasco but no excuse. The White House was warned and given a pandemic procedural protocol playbook and threw it away. It was from Obama. Ask Susan Rice.
All of this...what we are discussing now never even should have happened. Get it?? The HHS IG wondered why and started an investigation into the CDC SNS failure and guess what Trump did people...guess?
All this followup clown show shouldn't even be discussed until
after there is an investigation into the CDC SNS malfeasance.
Then we can find out those responsible, Azar, Redfield, Robert Kadlec, Kushner and Trump.

Having tamed infection rates is not enough. 

I certainly feel that way about NY — we have tamed the virus but that does not mean we should relax, yet. 

It might be another 12 months before we can relax — in the meantime, we know wearing a mask, not gathering in large crowds (indoors or out), and social distancing when you must be with or around people, all helps."
2020-07-24 11:02:55,"When did we become so weak?  We love to praise the earlier generations who fought in or endured hardships during World Wars that lasted years and years and killed scores of millions but we are asked to wear a mask while in public, socially distance, and not gather in indoor places and we act like it is unbearable and an infringement on being American.  All these tough talkers had an opportunity to step up and walk the talk.  Wearing a flag pin is easy, doing the right thing, not so much."
2020-07-24 11:31:41,"The new guideline that the public in the UK shall be required to wear mask in shops, supermarkets  and when picking up food and drink from restaurants, is something which is welcomed but could have been instituted at the beginning of the Pandemic by the UK Government. This is too little and too late.
This leaves the  public really at risk of picking up this deadly virus in the newly opened bars, restaurants and cinema's. Bars have been a well documented conduit in the US for spreading the virus amongst young people.
 We have over 45,000 people who have died from COVID19 in the UK, which is an outrageously high figure, which could have been  half this figure if lockdown had taken place at the beginning of March. Boris Johnson and his Government are now going on their summer break, having cancelled the essential daly Government briefing on the 23rd June, effectively declaring the job is done. This is a  reprehensible  dereliction of duty.
Even Trump has reconvened his press conferences.
 
The Tories need to be held to account for their collective, cavalier approach to this crisis which has cost tens of thousands of lives."

2020-07-24 11:24:31,"This virus looks too contagious to allow for relaxing social gathering restrictions.

2020-07-24 12:16:53,"I do not disagree with the data, which unequivocally shows the US at the bottom of its cohort.

However, I have serious doubts with the limited data we have on this new virus. When I look at today’s temperatures in Germany and most of France, I see lows in the 60s and highs in the low 80s. When I look at the states driving infections in the US, I see lows in the 80s and highs in the 100s. 

I won’t be surprised in January if the NE and Europe become hotspots (as populations move indoors) and the virus subsides in the southern US until late spring (as A/Cs turn back on).

Patience stinks, but we don’t even have four months of data (April-July) to validate public policy. To do so is to discount the affects of seasonality (geography)."
2020-07-24 12:23:23,"I am not sure how this city, a city that people *still* flock too en masse, a major transportation hub, is doing so well. I see so many people without masks, people sitting shoulder to shoulder in outdoor dining setups (just like pre-pandemic indoor dining), and people just letting their guard down in general. We see from examples around the world that peaks and valleys are to be expected. We are having our valley moment. The most frustrating thing is most people seem to think we can get back to normal the day after a vaccine is developed. We still don’t know enough about immunity to determine if a vaccine is even worth pursuing. If immunity only lasts a few months, will the vaccines be quarterly? I think we need to think beyond the vaccine until there is a consensus on immunity.

For now, we should savor our delicious outdoor meals."
2020-07-24 12:38:38,"This is a virus you have to avoid if you don't want the consequences. But avoiding it is hard. People who think they're being careful soon find themselves sick because every activity that brings humans together can result in transmission. There are no exceptions for family, friends and essential jobs, much less the restaurants, bars and theme parks the US insists on opening. Masks help, but offer no guarantee.

Given this reality, I don't see Americans getting the spread in our country down to levels where contact-tracing can follow the outbreaks unless we endure another shutdown, which may require far longer to show effectiveness as the virus is so much more prevalent now than in March.

Not to snipe at our failures; human nature and love of personal freedom are powerful obstacles here, and no pandemic of respiratory illness has ever been stopped anywhere on Earth in the past without vaccines, drugs or having run its course. But it's time to stop kidding ourselves. We can relish instant gratification in ""normalcy"" today or we can achieve a mostly Covid-free public environment with patience and cooperation. We cannot have it both ways."
2020-07-24 12:55:02,"Will NYC ever return to the old normal? I seriously doubt it. The wealthy New Yorkers are gone and may become occasional visitors to their City homes. Offices are empty and most workers are refusing to be the first group of returnees. Retail and Restaurants can not survive given the restrictions. 
The City and the MTA are in deep financial trouble and no relief in sight.
And lastly, the Progressive Mayor and City Council have allowed the Quality of Life and Safety to decline dramatically."
2020-07-24 12:16:58,"This virus doesn’t care about your personal beliefs or needs.  If it finds a vulnerable host it will enter it and reproduce.  Until everyone realizes that fact and takes protective measures, this pandemic will continue until we get a safe and effective vaccine and enough people intelligent enough to get vaccinated.
The alternative is a continuation of the status quo.  More daily infections and more deaths.  That is the nature’s hard way to control the human population."
2020-07-24 10:37:23,It is alarming how infectious conspiracy theories and mistrust of expert advice is during a pandemic. Trust in our public institutions is paramount during a crisis of this magnitude. The Trump administration is tearing apart the fabric of society with their false consciousness.

    Bolivians are now putting it into use. Even the Bolivian senate has approved the chlorine dioxide treatment though the country's health ministry has advised people to stay away from it."

- Over 7 MILLION kids now suffer from malnutrition due directly to the lockdown and many of them will now have lifelong learning disabilities (Brookings Institute study);

- Skyrocketing domestic violence (UN study);

- Profected dramatic increases in social isolation deaths;

-  I could go on.

The US is not designed and structured for a lockdown.  We should have anticipated the enormous human suffering it would generate.  Going forward we need to get smart and tough:

-  Social distancing and workplace protections are a must.

- If you can mandate seat belts in every vehicle and laws requiring EVERYONE to wear them, you can logically and legally mandate masks.

-  Isolate and protect the most vulnerable ... the caseload data clearly articulates this subset of the population.

Yes, we have saved lives, but at an enormous human suffering cost.  It is time to get tough and smart."

The state government in Victoria stuffed it up badly by using cheap security guards with no training to protect these hotel quarantine people. These security guards 
then took small levels of infection back to their own communities and chaos has now ensued.

This was all entirely preventable: the federal government had offered police and army to protect the hotels but the state government refused because the security guards are members of a union that  supports the state government. Jobs for the boys.  You couldn't make it up....."
2020-07-24 13:43:54,"Panic and irrational response is what is hurting US more than the Coronavirus 2, COVID-19. From the very beginning I have been commenting about requiring a multi-pronged response to managing the pandemic that has devastated the world. There were many lessons from the Chinese experience in dealing with the pandemic. Strict and efficient temporary lock down that included business shutdown and travel restriction was just ONE of those many lessons. Quarantine was another one. The major reason China was able to contain the spread was protective gear like proper masks worn properly and safe distancing which was already ingrained in the Asian culture where everyone outside the family is greeted from a distance with a bow or a greeting like namaste. 

Travel restrictions and shut down of businesses as well as closure of clinics and medical services for the 10 leading causes of death not including COVID-19 has been a mixed experiment that accomplished cleaning of our environment from pollution due to automobile, cruise ships, airlines and industries. The pace of climate change has been significantly paused during 2020 but the price that billions of our fellow humans have paid due to the loss of jobs, bankrupt businesses, migrant workers in India facing starvation, loss of livelihoods, adverse effects on life, liberty and pursuit of happiness is a clear reminder that it is high time to safely reopen and lift most of the restrictions that have crippled and suffocated human survival."

We are responding, as we have.
With patience."
2020-07-24 13:45:39,"The photos tell the picture! People gathering without masks. The perfect way to transmit the Covid-19 virus. In Germany where they don’t have a resurgence masks are mandatory and people are fined for now wearing one in public as are shop owners for allowing it. This is truly “deadly business” that requires an equally strong response. The virus is a killer and people need to view masks as handcuffs that will keep it from striking them, their friends and loved ones. That really should not be asking too much, but the unwillingness of many Republicans and their followers to see a mask as a way to disarm a killer has in states like Arizona, Texas and Florida led to a surge in cases and fatalities. “Live Free and Die” is not macho, not conservative, not a human right when the life you take may be a friend or a family member. It’s criminal and that’s why the Germans are right in treating it that way."

It appears as though we need to shut our country down and do a reset.  No one wants to do this, but it might be necessary to stop the spread of the virus.

It's unlikely this will happen.  To close our country down at this time and so close to the election, would most certainly mean a landslide victory for former Vice President Joe Biden.

Aside from the natural instinct to oppose anything this man says, just on the grounds that he said it, no one would argue that we're better off with schools closed, businesses shuttered and 30+ million people out of work. Everyone grimaces but agrees with Trump that things need to get back to normal. Yesterday Trump spent 30 minutes repeating himself... re-open the schools, re-open the schools, re-open the schools, here's why we need to re-open the schools.

We got it, Donald. Everybody in the entire country understands how concerned you are with the welfare of children [cough, cough]. So you can move on down the script you're reading from, to the part where it says all the things the government, YOUR administration, is going to do to make sure this happens safely.

I know that Trump's current (until November 3rd) monomaniacal focus in life is winning  the presidency for another term.  He hates, hates being a loser.  My advice to our hapless president: True, you won in 2016 but by slim margins in many states and with only a minority vote.  Every vote counts.  You should therefore begin to think about doing something about the burgeoning morbidity and mortality of this virus that is hurting so many people, also  in those states you need for the electoral count that helped you in 2016.   Now , I will tell you Mr. President, no one who is made really sick (as so many are) by Covid -19 and no family that lost a member to this disease will vote for you.  They will think that we suffer because of your delay in beginning to fight, because you simply threw the mess into the laps of the governors and stood aloof on the sidelines, that for such a long time you pooh-poohed the seriousness of this pandemic, assuring us that it would soon go away all by itself, especially with the summer heat---they will blame you and vote against you.  If you don't start listening to the guidelines of the experts--especially to Dr. Fauci, who has shown unusual honesty for someone in your entourage--and you persist in opening the economy and schools, you will lose badly.  So, pay attention to the science."

Trump and his crew inhibited caring for those afflicted by deferring responsibilities to uncoordinated states. They also declined to use the federal government power to urgently address the spread of the virus.

It is another thing, particularly when one knows he lies, to cheer him on when it is killing your own countrymen and women. 

This is just a sliver of the toxicity of Trump. 

There are lies for ratings and entertainment (again, absolutely disgraceful because they kill our constitution and trust in institutions) and then there are the lies that kill people. Literally. Kill. People. 

Over 135,000 deaths, mostly preventable were in not for Trump and his soon to be unelected republicans co-conspirators.

Sometimes lost employment and livelihood. So when you say, we need to start taking this thing seriously, we're just tired. We know. We've heard it, we've been listening. Add to that the ceaseless chastising from the media over the course of the past 5 months, from the mouths of people who continue to sit pretty in their ivory towers and spew vitriol at anyone who suggests that perhaps the solution isn't and could never be an endless shutdown.

Like when you host a party and people are not wearing masks because, hey, we know each other. Touching things, eating buffet food, pouring wine from a bottle everybody touches, or wine in a box.
Singing, shouting. Outdoors but also indoors unfortunately.

That is not contained by wearing a mask. These activities require careful planning from the host and guidelines for the attendees.
People can infect others up to 5 days before symptoms show. Or they might never have enough symptoms to be aware of their infection.

Being careful in contacts with friends and relatives is probably as important as masks. And probably an equally unwelcome message too."

From that the conclusion is that ten and unders can safely return to school. But that isn't how most distributions occur in nature. We can assume that the difference between those who are 10 and those who are 9 is negligible from a public health perspective. Perhaps even 8 year olds. My point is not that tens and under are the same as adults. The research suggests otherwise. But there is no solid line dividing these. It is a gradual and normal slope. So we cannot really say all tens and under are safe. Perhaps we can say that kindergartners are safe. As to those who are older, nobody has the wisdom to say where the line lies, because there is no such line."

We are truly living in a “Twilight Zone” reality, as the economic news that disseminates this month due to the COVID resurgence is now what Trump denied for far too many months. And the GOP is worried about the $600 per week - get a grip.

There has to be a unified approach, which with Trump is impossible now. All the denials, lies and obfuscations have finally caught up with him and his enablers.

Right now we are learning that Night life has to be postponed this year (tell that to young people), family reunions too, living conditions of produce pickers need to be improved, immigrants arriving to the coast had to isolate because of high numbers of infected from Africa (is Africa next?), Cataluña was not ready...and people need to be tested at place of origin  before traveling to Spain!!

Now I see that it’s us ADULTS who seemed to either never have learnt the lesson at all or have forgotten what it feels like. 
In the midst of a raging crisis it does feels like the world is crashing upon you but think back; if you’re alive, you survived. Maybe not well. Maybe not whole. But you did survive. 

C’mon folks. We can argue until kingdom come, play the blame game but ultimately our fight is against a virus, not each other. And in this case, we have overwhelming evidence that wearing masks, washing our hands & social distancing - just 3 things - make a big difference. 

We can get back to school, to work, to meeting people but we can’t do it if we keep refusing to accept that this is our REALITY for a while & it can’t happen if we continue with the rah-rah-blah-blah over the basics.

Now Trump is repeating his same relentless push and pressure for classrooms to open in less than 6-8 weeks.  If this isn't a repeat recipe for another disaster waiting to happen, I don't know what is.

I find Trump's argument of school reopenings being ""expensive and difficult for many districts, like broad testing of students and faculty and contact tracing to find people exposed to an infected student or teacher"" incredulous. BILLIONS have been award to various drug companies for the making and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19 but suddenly, to ensure kids can return to a safe school environment, Trump is saying that feat would be 'too expensive""."

Countries that have opened up have had far lower infection rates than the U.S.  The Times published a chart today showing that 10 U.S. states are recording new cases at a higher rate than any country.  How is this document not professional malpractice?"

No only are far more people becoming sick more quickly here than nearly anywhere else, but our economy is effectively diminishing in a whole number of ways. 30 million workers lost their jobs and there are not jobs yet to employ them and Republicans claim that giving them money will keep them unemployed. These unemployed people are facing not just a loss of unemployment but a loss of their property or domiciles. The public institutions which are keeping our civil life stable are being deprived of revenues and will have to do less when what they do is needed more. People are not consuming in normal amounts and neither are they going to with their wealth being used up. Vast numbers of privately owned businesses are shuttered or are insolvent. The only money to be made from investments and lending money is the redistribution of it by the financial markets acting like big casinos. The contraction is severe and great, and it means a slow recovery when the pandemic is on the wane."

So the ""good""news is that kids are at low risk of becoming severely ill but the ""bad"" news is that kids could bring the virus home to their parents, siblings, grandparents,etc. who could be in a great risk group.

I am deeply troubled that the C.D.C. has folded and  yielded to the wishes and demands of the president rather than what is best for the health and safety of ALL Americans, including children, and actually downplayed the potential health risks to America's kids.

For crying out loud, schools have been closed since very early Spring.  This virus has neither waned nor diminished.  And yet, six months later, schools across the country have not devised a way in which kids could return to the classroom safely and Trump is chomping at the bit, practically pushing kids out their front doors and back to school.

Shame on the C.D.C. for caving into political pressure rather than standing on solid scientific ground.

Please read up on virus aerosols, in NYT and elsewhere, and consider that CDC leadership, other than Fauci maybe, has become a pawn of Trump, whose only acceptance of “science” is that of Darwin, in social context — he and his top people, like very rich Betsy DeVos likely believe that only the truly wealthy (and white) should survive.  The likes of DeVos and Trump send their kids to fancy, expensive private schools that can afford all of the very best of the best precautionary measures and space and equipment, or to hire exclusive, maybe even live-in tutors for their kids.  In other words, it won’t be their kids or grandkids going to public schools (many of which already were overcrowded) and it won’t be their sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, spouses or adult children going to teach in those crowded, under-resourced public schools — so it won’t be them getting debilitating and deadly illness, but all the rest of us 99-percent folk.

Trump’s entire presidency seems geared toward dividing our country (including by throwing responsibility for responding to and containing the covid19 to individual states so there is no unity of purpose and just more chaos) and weakening it and us.  The more chaos, the more discord, the better for America’s foes, many of whom Trump seems to like very very much, and eventually the more money for Betsy DeVos’s brother."

2020-07-24 15:41:32,"Not my grandson. We are Democrats and he is staying home. My stepson still has his hopes pinned on Amway 20 years after he declared bankruptcy because he thought he was going to be rich within two months.  I hear he and my stepgranddaughter are traveling to Colorado, so they’re probably exposed.￼They haven’t been social distancing because he’s Republican. There’s nothing I can do so we’ll just have to see.￼"
2020-07-24 15:43:09,Is there really no concern for the health of teachers and families?
2020-07-24 15:47:28,"“trump” cancels the Republican coronation in FL, but wants your kids back in school. How bout he reinstate the convention and force all his Republican sycophants into that hall cheek to jowl first? Then he can insist all these kids be put at risk. 

And it’s all a “discussion” about the kids and their risks, but last time I checked there were a LOT of adults involved in getting them there, teaching them, feeding them, and supervising them, etc. And all these people go home to their family. A recipe for disaster: that should be “trump’s” slogan."
2020-07-24 15:37:06,Why doesn’t the CDC director have the gumption to resign instead of bowing to political pressure?  The CDC used to be world-respected as the leader in comunicable disease research.  Now it is just another mouthpiece for Trump’s political agenda. I am disgusted. Who can we believe?
2020-07-24 15:45:51,"Dr. Fauci begs to disagree, numerous times just this week.  Currently disagreeing live with Robert Costa as I write this."
2020-07-24 15:49:11,"I personally am not listening to any suggestions about the disposition of my child and schooling.

2020-07-24 15:29:12,"The CDC has just become a political arm of the Trump regime.  They should not be trusted.  in fact, their lethal errors at the start of this pandemic along with Trump's complete and utter disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic is why we are in this very bad place."
2020-07-24 15:34:01,"Donald J. Trump has politicized Covid-19 and the CDC, putting your family at risk simply so he can attempt to get re-elected. If you vote for him you’re part of the problem."
2020-07-24 15:37:08,"That's AMAZING NEWS.

For most of the Hispanic, black and non-white population (yes, I know NYT readers love reading such words!), closed schools are a NIGHTMARE and a certain driver for bankruptcy and all sorts of disgrace to us, non-whites.

Please understand that Latinos and other color workers rarely have fancy jobs that can still be worked from home. Lower paying jobs are mostly done in-person and we do need schools open 5 days a week, as many hours a day as possible, to go to work.

Democrats' ideology for keeping the economy closed and pushing for schools to remain closed is a major reason why myself, as a Latino, work really hard to convince other Latinos to support Trump. Trump - although a brute and lacking in so many senses - is still a better option than democrats!"
2020-07-24 15:37:31,"Hmmm.  Keep the children six feet apart and don’t let them move between classrooms.  That makes so much sense.  They can do push-ups in the room for gym, do experiments at their desk for science (oops, don’t need no science), and have the same teacher teach all the classes to minimize transmission.  Sounds like a good old 18th century schoolhouse with 10 kids ( grades 1-8) in the same room.  I am sure it will work so well today.

Let’s rename CDC - Trump’s American Propaganda Science (TAPS).  They already have a fitting theme song."
2020-07-24 15:49:20,"Coin shortage? First of all stop distributing pennies. They cost more to produce and distribute them then they are worth. 

The good old market will take care of itself by learning how to round up and down. 

Second do the same with the nickel. Seriously can anyone buy anything with a nickel?  Round everything up/down to the nearest dime. 

Millions will thank you. 

Oh, can someone tell me why the US is the only country that doesn’t show a coin’s value in numbers but gives them names?"
2020-07-24 15:31:39,"This is 1000% political debate. This has zero to do with children. If it had to do with the health of children then we would have to work on making the online learning process better on multiple levels. They talk about students needing to get back to school for mental health reasons?? So keeping them cooped up in a single classroom all day without moving them around the school is going to solve that??

This is a last ditch attempt by the current failed administration to kick start the economy before November. If school opened up in December this year they would not care about any of this... its all about the election."
2020-07-24 15:38:49,"There you have it: definitive proof that a return to school will put the lives of our children at risk. Once this administration sets a position, you can always assume the opposite is true. Such a shame that the CDC must be added to the list of agencies we can no longer afford to trust."
2020-07-24 15:26:07,"Cue the mass resignations of teachers. And who would blame them, as if we don’t already disrespect their profession.

Lord, may we return to health and sanity in 2021."
2020-07-24 15:44:15,"CDC under Robert Redfield has become another Trump tool. It is very sad to see the premier public health agency in the world crumble just like so many other government agencies, formerly guided by facts and critical thinking, to the nation's detriment."
2020-07-24 15:48:45,"Trump can pontificate all he wants.  The CDC can issue all the bogus “recommendations” it wants to. This decision will be made by parents, grandparents, and guardians along with teachers and local school administrators.  The CDC got it right the first time.  NOT this newly revised guidance."
2020-07-24 15:35:03,"As long as things keep going back to normal when things are actually NOT normal, there will continue to be a resurgences where things were under control. Until there's a Vaccine to help with massive Immunity, the Virus will continue to have a huge impact on us all."
2020-07-24 15:35:54,"We're now a country where all federal agencies - including the ones tasked with public health - make it their utmost priority to serve the president's political interests, even at the expense of public safety.

We can no longer trust Covid numbers, given that the Trump WH (and their sycophants in the Texas and Florida capitols) is in charge of the figures.

Remember back in March when Trump officials couldn't stop talking about how China's numbers couldn't be trusted and were manipulated? Turns out they were just projecting."
2020-07-24 15:46:37,"As far as scientists claims of the risks of kids transmitting the disease as being relatively unknown, ask anyone who’s been a teacher around them all day for any length of time and it’s certainly known to them that kids catch, bring and spread everything.  This constant need for scientific data to back up basic common sense is getting ridiculous.  We seem to use the need more now as a crutch for trying to avoid the unavoidable."
2020-07-24 15:24:55,"Regardless of the CDC and trump, Seattle schools will not reopen in the fall, online classes only."
2020-07-24 15:43:53,"CDC has now almost reversed their school opening guidance based on pressure from Trump. Ultimately, its a parent's choice to send their kids to school in these times but all I ll say is this -  These leaders get tested everyday and their families get tested everyday while most of us don't even have that option. All these leaders are millionaires and dont even send their kids to public schools, most of them go to high-end private schools. Dont let these people tell you if your kid's life matters or not. Dont let your decisions be guided by the people who refuse to even ensure safety from gun violence in schools."
2020-07-24 16:03:56,"An ironic aspect - there are people who feel the CDC has folded to pressure in this recommendation, but were glad when the CDC folded to external pressure to require masks earlier.  This is similar to the pressure campaign on the WHO to change their advice about the coronavirus being airborne.

In the end, all of these decisions are political - it's not possible to separate the ""scientific"" aspect from the ""political"" aspect. 

Looking at the campaign for the WHO, a central part of the argument was the precautionary principle"" that advice should be conservative when the science is mixed.  That principle is a political principle, not a scientific one. If such principles are allowed, why not also principles such as ""children are better served by being at school"". 

This is not to say that the new CDC decision is wrong - it's probably better for schools not to reopen, or to reopen in a vastly different way. But funding for those options does not seem to be forthcoming, so the best the CDC can do is give advice for schools that will likely reopen anyway."
2020-07-24 16:05:31,"Amazing - Not one word about 1 child bringing home disease to 2 (on average) parents/caregivers, or the fate of teachers, who will face students 5 days/week.
Children may be less likely to suffer severe symptoms or die from COVID, but those who don’t make terrific vectors."
2020-07-24 16:08:43,"Did the CDC forget that the teachers at the schools are adults? Yes. We know students out of school for extended time is bad. This is why summer breaks are getting shorter and shorter. They literally wrote a great response on why schools should be year round, but did nothing to address, limit, or minutely discuss the safety of the students IN the school..."
2020-07-24 16:14:31,"Upon further review the revised CDC information, the revisions  fail to provide statistics as to the transference of COVID to multi-generational families, who either have parents, other adults, and/or grandparents who either already have other maladies or other illnesses?

How come the CDC did not include these statistics?"
2020-07-24 16:16:13,"Decreasing student enrollment means reducing staff.
If parents don't send their children to school but remain registered the parents are at risk being charged with truancy for failing to provide mandated education.  If they choose to move their child to home schooling then the school will reduce staff accordingly so that when the child returns, the conditions will be worse than before.  The Trump solution? Send the child to school where he can come home with both an education and spread the virus to his family.  Older teachers (who are paid more) can quit and allow younger teachers to replace them.  Reducing education in the long term, for all (especially in cities and blue states) reduces the inflated salaries that educated people get.  Any questions?"
2020-07-24 16:22:42,"The CDC was founded in 1946 (thanks, Google). I guess a 74 year run of being the gold standard for study, prevention, treatment and containment of infectious diseases was a pretty good run. 

Everything Trump touches dies."
2020-07-24 16:27:26,"The CDC guidelines grievously omit safety concerns for adult staff, administrators, and teachers. What about them? Educating students depends on the physical and emotional health of these essential workers. At least, teachers have a voice through their unions. The CDC takes their presence as a given."
2020-07-24 16:29:59,"This Administration politicized the wearing of masks, and we can all see how that turned out. The states that fully embraced a return to normal, even though nothing is normal right now, are paying a hefty price. 

Now they are politicizing the return to school?

I’m actually for kids going back, if, and only if, we can be creative about how it works. If, and only if, they are able to have all the safety precautions they need, which includes PPE for teachers, staff, and maintenance people. If, and only if, local schools can make decisions that work for them. 

Let’s not let our schools become laboratories for what happens when wishful thinking trumps science. Florida can tell you how that works out."
2020-07-24 15:43:21,"I am appalled to learn that the CDC has bowed to political pressure and softened its scientific guidelines, endangering this nation's children. Science is science, not something ""spun"" to align with the re-election needs of an ill-informed president. Where is the CDC's backbone?"
2020-07-24 16:18:37,"The more every person, politician, organization, party compromises its principles because of his bullying or threat, the more he is empowered."
2020-07-24 16:24:48,I am surprised the CDC did a 180 and  refused to stand on its square regarding school openings.  Any trust the public had in the CDC is completely gone now.  Good luck trying to convince the masses to take the rushed Covid-19 vaccine.
2020-07-24 16:03:37,Those American teachers who value their own lives more than the state of the economy or Trump’s career should simply refuse to teach in crowded schools.
2020-07-24 16:25:44,"Now how can we ever trust anything the CDC says?  We cannot be at all sure any of the agency's guidelines are based on science, rather than fear for their jobs.  Trump  has systematically destroyed confidence in the National Weather Service, the Justice Department, the FBI and the Pentagon.  If he can do the same for the national election, we are truly sunk."
2020-07-24 16:34:22,"This CDC document makes a strong case for better funding public schools in normal times. But it’s laughable as COVID guidance: no mention of even basic measures like masks and social distancing; no recognition of teachers, staff, and family members who will be put at risk; and therefore of course no strategies for how to do this safely. 

Instead of draining the swamp, Trump has dragged our most trusted institutions down the drain."
2020-07-24 15:55:22,If Barron’s school isn’t opening then no other school should be forced to open.
2020-07-24 15:57:02,"I mourn for the CDC, which sold its soul to Trump. It now values its institutional survival￼ over the survival of our children.  ￼"
2020-07-24 15:58:14,"The latest NY Times article on Covid-19 transmission says that while children under 10 may have a lower chance of transmitting the virus to adults, those over 10 have the same chance of transmitting the virus to others as adults do. Sounds like a politically motivated change of guidelines by the CDC. So,if the transmission rates go up based on these guidelines, the onus falls on Trump, his administration and the CDC. Shame on all of them."
2020-07-24 16:23:41,"I'll be surprised if this comment gets posted, but here we go.

I was never impressed by Dr. Redfield (CDC director), a sharp contrast to Dr. Fauci in having the spine to stand up to Donald Trump.  The article says ""CDC this, CDC that"" . .  isn't really Dr. Redfield whom we are talking about here?  I doubt the Center can issue directives to the nation without his approval.

So apparently the president has gotten to him, too.  Unless the good doctor does his bidding, out he goes like many others.  And I suspect Dr. Birx is more than ready to replace him."
2020-07-24 15:53:47,"No kid anywhere has given this bug to a teacher.
The flu? Oh, yeah, all over the place.
But this specifically-designed priority lab project? 

No.
The teachers' organizations are told to promote the most damage that they can cause for the election in 100 days BUT we can't wait until Nov. 4th to open schools, the ''eyes on kids'' that report abuse & neglect have been diverted for months too long already. 

But if you really despise everything that makes us America, you should campaign to not open schools for months or years. I'd prefer you just left."
2020-07-24 16:02:53,"The Cuban Missile Crisis was a day at the beach compared to this insanity. With the world on fire, thousands dying, an economy in shambles, and completely incompetent leadership in the White House, this really feels like the end of the world. Bleak."
2020-07-24 16:18:27,It’s great that we can no longer trust the CDC. Another broken governmental institution thanks to Trump and three Republicans.
2020-07-24 15:51:36,"The CDC has fully discredited itself with today’s “full throated” call to reopen schools. Let’s hope that individual school districts will continue to protect their students, teachers and families by refusing to fall for this insanity."
2020-07-24 16:00:33,"Maybe after the schools open for children and staff, we can get a daily tally of how many confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths have occurred broken down by children, teachers and other school workers. Then again, I guess the CDC wouldn’t be tabulating this for public consumption. Shame on the CDC!"
2020-07-24 15:53:10,"The CDC is no longer an independent scientific agency. It is now the voice of Trump, or those in charge get canned.
The kids' 'health' matter to return to public school. Well perhaps maybe the fearless leader should have taken this seriously back in December. 
Under a legitimate administration, the US probably would have been the leader, preventing the virus from spreading like wildfire. But instead, Trump and his supporters are blind as ever, insisting people risk their health to boost a suffering economy, all in an effort to make this fraudulent administration look good. 
We need a full 180 in November to even have a basic of chance of containing this."
2020-07-24 16:04:58,"Now it all makes sense. In the last couple of days, Trump did a 180 degree turn on his attacks against the CDC and moderated his insistence that all schools re-open for universal attendance, now seemingly deferring to the CDC for guidance.  Why, all of a sudden, did he appear to be backing off on his push to get everyone out of their homes and into schools and businesses to make it appear before election day that everything's coming up roses (except, of course, for the bodies piling up in refrigerator trucks)? Did he suddenly see the light? We found out the answer this morning. The CDC folded and has now publicly done a total about-face, fully advocating Trump's position of ""Everybody back to school!""  This is a typical and all-too-obvious bait and switch which still won't get Trump any closer to 4 more years."
2020-07-24 16:14:56,"And now we can add the CDC to the list of government agencies corrupted by Trump and automatically deemed untrustworthy.  And Republicans wonder why trust in government is at an all time low.  

Haven’t we learned anything from opening too soon?  We are not prepared as a nation to open schools across the board.  But Trump is willing to sacrifice lives to gain a few votes. The man has no brains, but also no soul."
2020-07-24 16:21:10,"It's OK for the CDC under Redfield, who is a Trump appointee, to push school children back to a situation where they can bring home the virus to their families. But Trump's kid, like the rest of those that are privileged, is not returning to his school. They are not reopening. Which universe are your children in!"
2020-07-24 16:14:50,"Well at the beginning of this, I advised my church congregation to stay off Facebook and only listen to what the CDC and the WHO said. Now, I’m not listening to the CDC and the WHO isn’t looking so good either. I also advised against cynicism and complacency - both are rampant. Mask up and bunker up, I guess. Time to inventory the cans of beans I have."
2020-07-24 16:01:09,So sad there is no one to trust.    Biden will clean house but not soon enough.
2020-07-24 16:09:10,"Isn’t it sad that we cannot have a rational discussion about schools reopening because President Trump has corrupted the CDC? It’s not surprising - he has corrupted everything he has touched during his term. But it’s still sad, and like so many of his other actions and failures to act, it will cost lives. 

When he ran in 2016 and various people said that he was simply incapable of meeting the demands of the office, I don’t think that they were thinking of this kind of example. But then again, I don’t think that many people could have imagined Trump’s ability to destroy our national institutions. There is literally nothing that he has touched that hasn’t been made worse."
2020-07-24 16:15:53,"Finally, Trump achieved his goal of becoming the King of USA. He has bent every independent institution to his will. It also shows human frailty. The folks in charge of such institutions fail to revolt and defy for fear of losing jobs. They want to hold on to power, whatever it means in this context. The Kitchen Cabinet is back. And we can soon declare ourselves a Banana Republic. Well done, me fellow citizens. True, what Trump has achieved in 3.5 years, no other president has been able to achieve in 200  years."
2020-07-24 16:24:32,"They’re all in cahoots. We are witnessing the end of our country. Just look at all fronts. The cities, the election, the schools. Trump is well on his way to a coup."
2020-07-24 15:54:02,"I wonder if these Oregon residents filing suits to not wear masks due to medical, psychological and political reasons will stick to their beliefs if and when they catch covid and require oxygen (through a mask)."
2020-07-24 16:02:38,"Well, it didn’t take long for the CDC to crater and fall. The so-called scientists and public health experts at the CDC are kowtowing to political pressure in order to keep their jobs, I guess. Everyone in government, it seems, can be bribed. Everyone has his or her price. I for one will not be getting a COVID-19 vaccination. I’m not going to be a guinea pig for Trump. Any vaccine approved by a federal agency nowadays simply will not be safe. Too many billions of dollars are at stake for the approval process to not be corrupted by personal greed. Our lives are worth nothing."

2020-07-24 15:52:53,"We are doomed for at least another generation, or longer. The damage to trust in science and public health experts cannot be downplayed. Our current leaders keep lending aid and comfort to the anti-vaccinators and conspiracy peddlers.

We and future generations will pay a heavy price."
2020-07-24 15:55:33,"The CDC has lost all credibility with Americans. Once a highly respected government agency, the CDC has failed in the largest pandemic in modern history. The very purpose for which it was created. And when the time came for the CDC to go into action, it became a political tool, nothing less. Which begs the question: what can’t Donald Trump politicize? Dr Redfield has proven to be nothing but a Trump sycophant. Science is now secondary in the CDC to political objectives. Which is why the virus has exploded nationwide. A total lack of leadership from the CDC and the President. At this point, they should just disband the CDC and start over."
2020-07-24 16:04:02,"This past week we saw the passing of courageous Civil Rights leaders who in their time, were ready to lay down their lives for a just cause. And many actually paid with their lives. The experts and professionals at CDC are not facing such existential threats, yet they caved in to political pressure and are playing politics with people's lives. 

Later in their careers when trump is long gone (or in prison), they will look back to these times with shame and regret, knowing that they contributed to the deaths of thousands of Americans. 

They will forever live with the knowledge that they were cowards when courage was most needed."
2020-07-24 16:18:50,"Trump erroneously thinks that he can get the economy humming again if he pushes to reopen schools, which will enable the parents of school-aged children to return to work and help him politically. 

What he's ignoring is the fact that if schools reopen without proper safety precautions the virus will spread not only to school staff and their families, but will also infect entire communities where students live, causing an explosion of cases of Covid-19.

Parents and their children are routinely exposed to viruses during the school year, but it's criminally negligent to reopen during a deadly pandemic without taking proper precautions. 

It's obvious that Trump has muzzled the doctors at the CDC. Congress has to step up and intervene."
2020-07-24 15:55:33,"This CDC recommendation on reopening schools reduces their credibility to close to zero. Wait until they start recommending vaccinations - it won't just be the anti-vaxers not getting vaccinated- it will be me and millions of others who no longer trust the CDC. I have a compromised immune system and I am old, but I will wait for the European or China vaccines before following any CDC recommendations. Trump has politicized the CDC and now there is no one we can trust!"
2020-07-24 16:25:31,"This fool could easily get re-elected if he’d just start manufacturing PPE, helping hospitals, and telling people to wear masks (his cult would probably adhere to his recommendations more than anyone else would). No one expects him to cure the virus and the bar is so pathetically low for him (passing a MOCA test, drinking with one hand, not punching the Queen on a visit to the UK, etc) that he could easily do less than the bare minimum and get competitive with Biden within a week. But he’s so broken that this easy path might as well be the peak of Everest to him."

2020-07-24 16:27:51,"The Center for Disease Control is a non-political agency. The actions it takes should be based entirely on health, medical and issues of affordability. The CDC should be run by highly qualified doctors, epidemiologists and competent non-partisan administrators. The function of this agency involves questions and concerns of public health.
The CDC has no business involving itself in electoral issues. Those who administer this agency should RESIST any attempts by elected officials to drag the CDC into political campaigns.

Similarly, the U.S. Dept. of Education and those of the fifty states have a non-political mandate. Educational standards, safety, fairness, etc. Ideally, the education of America’s young prople should NEVER be used as a chip in an election.

Mr. Trump’s attempts to use the CDC and the public schools in his desperate bid for reelection should be repugnant to all fair-minded voters, Republican and Democrat. Let us hope he’s foiled in his twisted scheme."
2020-07-24 16:29:47,"The CDC needs to move into the mandatory budget side with Medicare, social security, and the like.

For this government, the only truth is that being fired by the president is a badge of honor, so the management at the CDC has none. 

It should be obvious that schools, even with reduced class rooms and other feel-good safety measures, are not a good idea at this time. Air sits in rooms, children will not wear masks and will 'forget' to wash their hands. Schools may not have funding to implement required cleaning protocols (or may shrug it off as paranoia). 

Is it worth to play Russian roulette with the lifes of children?Some kids may get seriously sick and, as stated many times, school employees and adults at home may get sick from their children."

The Center has now joined ranks with Donald Trump's will to destroy the health and welfare of Americans no matter their political ideology, no matter their age, no matter their gender.  To play this political game during a lethal pandemic with our kids, our future, is nothing less than criminal.  I do not know what is driving Mr. Trump to play God.  Is it his insatiable ego?  Or greed?  Whatever is part of his DNA, it can be said he is an amoral being.  And the CDC has succumbed to his treacherous ways.   This is a disgrace."

2020-07-24 16:19:16,The CDC has forgotten  that its primary mission  is to be apolitical and to  maintain the highest standards of public health in its recommendations. This shows that this esteemed institution has been corrupted by its association with Trump and his political agenda. What a shame this is for our future in handling appropriately the pandemic!
2020-07-24 15:52:31,No problem in Florida.  Any one can say they home school without any oversight.

Obviously, the New Zealanders are smart people, they did not elect a prime minister like Hoax Don and Republican-like representatives. No wonder they trust the government!

Our country is a mess because we are now paying the price for electing Hoax Don and Republicans, Risk and Reward!

Simple, isn't it?"
2020-07-24 16:06:09,Great.  The CDC has been coerced into becoming a Trump toady.  So much for advocating public health.
2020-07-24 15:50:31,"Do that’s it then. Trump has twisted the soft parts of the intelligence services, the pentagon, the weather services (backing him up on the fake path of a hurricane last year), the National Archives (traditionally a recorder of history but making an exception for this clown by altering pictures that were unflattering), and now the CDC. I’m sure I left fine out in between- there are so many of them.

And as far as people not believing anything anymore, including not jumping for joy at the prospect of mass COVID vaccinations - DO NOT JUDGE. Don’t lump people wary of a COVID vaccine in with your typical antivaccers. The American people have no reason whatsoever to trust anything the CDC says about the safety of a vaccine (manufactured by companies that never produced anything close to ever before)."

Why is this so hard for Americans to understand? We are dealing with a virus that has no cure. The only thing we can do at present is manage the risk through preventative measures. 

People who have chronic diseases understand this. I have relapsing-remitting MS. Thankfully I have learned what triggers relapses, and I do everything within my power to avoid them. Would I love to eat Girl Scout cookies? Yes. Would I love to spend the whole summer outside under the blazing sun? Yes. But both of these things, excess sugar and heat, exacerbate my symptoms. I’d rather not wake up unable to feel my feet. I’d rather not wake up with one eye blurry. I’d rather not experience these debilitating symptoms because that means I have to take steroids, and steroids are the devil. So how do I avoid the devil? I don’t do the things that I know to summon him. 

Wear your masks. Keep social distancing. Don’t send your kids into schools where they are not safe. Heed the science. Minimize your risks by heeding the science. For now, that’s all we can do."

2020-07-24 16:32:23,"Kids need to be in school. The risk of missing a year of education outweighs the risk COVID. Schools should at least give it a try. Despite Trump being a despicable human being, I have to agree with him on this one."

If anything happens to Dr. Fauci, we're all toast."
2020-07-24 16:47:22,Trump's model schools will have neither testing nor science. However he will assign Betsy DeVos to perform the duties of a hall monitor at various urban high schools. I'm sure she can show teachers how to have students maintain social distancing as the students pass from class to class or in out the entrance doors before or after class. Sad!

So now even the CDC is carrying Trump's water?"
2020-07-24 16:34:47,"It is appalling the disregard for science and data this administration has. It is appalling how selfish people are. There is no reliable data of children transmission of covid19, because it is too soon to know that. There are documented cases of children getting covid19 and being gravely ill, some of them died. What about the adults in school? Teachers, paraprofessionals, custodians, cafeteria personnel? They are in contact with numerous children throughout the day. Maybe a parent is thinking only of her own kids (one or maybe two), showing disregard for the rest of the people in their school. Is this really about the wellbeing of their kids or the inconvenience of having them at home all the time? Are these parents urged to send their children to school because they are going back to their jobs or because they will finally work at home in peace? Two or three months ago everybody was praising and validating teacher´s work, how wonderful they are, how can they do that every day, they should be paid much more and so on. Today, after four months with children at home, parents are sneering at teachers and threatening to lower their salaries, calling them lazy and many other names. Why? Because they can not stand their own children 24/7. Do you know why children behave at school? Because teachers set limits and expectations, and they follow through. Those parents who do the same at home know what I am talking about."
2020-07-24 16:35:15,"I’m very perplexed right now at our local government and DOE, who are denying individual schools the option of staying 100% remote learning for the first part of the school year. Why gear up the locations for 5-7 days a month of on-site learning? Stay remote for the first term, until the apparent “bad” fall flu season is over and we’re closer to a vaccine? Come on! De Blasio and Carranza can and should delve deeper into a more creative and smarter solution to this, and it isn’t dragging students and school staff into school buildings, while the actual curriculum suffers as a result. This isn’t a time to rush into something so uncertain, and our community shouldn’t be the testers for such an experiment."

2020-07-24 15:38:20,"Yeah, no thanks.  At a time when real health officials decry the current massive spread of covid being driven largely by young people gathering, the official Trump CDC tells us to gather them in the schools.

It’s time for Dr. Robert Redfield to resign or be impeached. There is or should be no place where one of the nation’s premier public health agencies should abandon its mission to the public health for the political health of Donald Trump. You don’t need to be a physician to not approve reopening public schools in the midst of an out of control deadly epidemic in the Southern tier of the country from California to Florida.

It is true open Schools are essential for a working economy, and very important for the kids. But at the current US virus levels open schools are guaranteed to spread the virus further. The children are not immune and will catch and spread the virus.

Essentially nothing can remain open in the hardest hit areas until they get some control. Ordering adults and kids back to ""normal"" simply won't work. The virus itself will lock down the society and economy. A controlled lock-down is merely acting rationally before the virus rule with chaos. That's what many nations managed in 4-6 weeks of honest lock-down, at much lower costs than the US losses by now.

The GOP senate majority can't agree on what to do, but they do not discuss how to beat the virus, just how to compensate some a bit or not.

The US is effectively rudderless amidst a surging pandemic, left without a functioning government or legislature. It is every state for themselves, and every citizen left to fight the pandemic alone and try to balance health and economical risks for themselves and their kids."

If parents would put as much energy into finding solutions to educate their children via online (excluding parents who have difficulty due to income or lack of resources in their area) then whatever problems which are created by COVID/CDC guidence/Trump adminstration could be tackled. 

Instead, there's been on-going complaints and I bet the parents who are complaining the loudest have kids who can binge watch tv for 8 hours but can't sit still for 45 mins to learn algebra."

I challenge the C.D.C. to ride a bus in a northern climate in late fall and winter with windows open for fresh air. Did they even take into account what would happen during a rainfall? 

If you are a parent living in a large area school district and your children are on buses with students of all ages from all backgrounds for a long ride, you need to advise your school board that opening is a risk not worth taking for your children. Now."

Wishing and hoping, that this national government should have done their jobs months earlier to fight the virus, is a waste of everybody's time. All I've heard from trump is ""what a great job he is doing"" and the ""virus will just go away"". But if you listen closely you may hear something about the virus stuck in between trump-talk about the upcoming elections.   Thanks for nothing.

An event that lasts a few days at most rather than a whole school year.

Why would they care, people like Trump and Moscow Mitch? Their grandchildren probably have Covid-19 tested tutors if they want, and go to exclusive privileged schools that can afford to be safe... Much like the draft back in my day, it wasn't their sons for the most part that got to tramp through the rice paddy's. A few did though, like John F. Kennedy, and that's the kind of president we need now, IMHO."

2020-07-24 17:38:30,"If you don't trust the CDC, look to the European and Canadian counter parts.  Just ignore the unions. 

On Ontario Canada last year, the Teachers Union struck over online learning, so when covid hit, the public system went dark and has basically been home schooling.   The private school I send my kid was able to have 6hrs instruction on Zoom in 1 week. 

For then upcoming school year - NYTimes subscribers types will be opting out of the public system, leaving the middle and lower class kids to fall  behind. I have no trust in the Teaching Industrial Complex."

A generation, taught to think and care only about themselves and no one else, is now expected to care about others, especially the elderly, is ludicrous. Ain't gonna happen, my friend. The chickens have come home to roost.That's why laws requiring masks and distancing need to be made and enforced. Now."
2020-07-24 17:09:20,"This is the thing about the virus that needs to be understood. It's a virus. You can't reason with it. You can't distract it. You can't plead with it. 

The virus doesn't care about your political affiliation. It doesn't care that your knowledge of medicine and science is non-existent. It doesn't care that you're impatient and that you really want the world to go back to the way it was before. 
If you catch Covid-19 and have the right genes and/or pre-existing conditions, you will die. You can't beg for mercy - it has none. This virus will continue to spread through our society until one of three things happens - 1. we completely eradicate it. 2. it completely eradicates us. 3. either we or it mutate enough to be able to effectively fight it. 
In this fight, there is no declaring victory, there's no negotiated surrender. This is like a zombie apocalypse where if even one escapes, the whole mess will start all over again. The answer in those movies was always painfully obvious - why is it so hard in real life?

The virus does two things - infect things and reproduce. Understand that. Internalize that. If the virus has the opportunity to infect you, it will immediately do so, without hesitation and without remorse.  Protect yourselves, your family and your community. 

Your lives actually depend on it."

2020-07-24 17:14:40,"I think it's time for CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield to resign. He has overseen a series of inept responses by the CDC to the pandemic going back to the beginning of the year. The political tone of the agency's latest call for children to return to school even if that results in them getting infected with the coronavirus and spreading it to their families is without precedent, except for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and the much-tested president. For the good of the nation, we need new leadership at the CDC, as well as in the US Senate and the White House."

It’s ok to defund the CDC. The entire country has lost confidence in its leadership and commentary now that it has been politicized. 

Disband the department of justice, too. Or better, make trump pay for the budget from his billions since they are working for him and not the country.

I fact, we don’t need anything but the president. As he said - he, alone, can do it.

2020-07-24 17:56:22,"Education is essential. I am shocked that so many people who are screaming about social justice online are so willing to have poor minority youth left behind. I am disgusted, frankly, that frontline workers are expected to support society but suddenly teachers are too delicate to take on the same risks. 

This article is a joke. The science is as ""settled"" as new science gets - young kids are not likely to get severely ill from COVID. Period. And teachers should mask up and face shield up and wash their hands and do their part like the rest of us. The AAP and CDC have spoken very clearly about how unhealthy it is to leave kids at home. Shame on everyone supporting hysteria and disparity."
2020-07-24 17:35:00,"Every person not vaccinated or immune due to having been exposed may become infected. Most infected will not be seriously ill, so most people will not become seriously ill from this virus. One in ten will be so seriously infected that they will receive medical care, and about one in ten hospitalized will be so sick that they will die. So the odds of dying are small, in terms of rates. 

But apply those rates to vast numbers of people and it becomes a pandemic that makes so many ill that anyone who needs medical care may not be able to receive it and the toll of dead and seriously harmed people just increases far beyond the extent of the pandemic. 

Trump and his supporters are acting ignorantly and it affects everyone."

2020-07-24 17:59:45,"We should care about all needless deaths. Here's a fact: Even if 1,000 people died every day of covid - which is NOT a fact, it would still not even be close to the number of people that die every year because of smoking and secondly from cardiovascular disease - which is caused by the standard american/western diet. (Animal-based foods.) The mass farming, slaughter, and human consumption of animals is causing our human and ecological health more harm every day, world-wide.
Out of 330+ million US citizens, how many deaths are there because of covid - how many people have actually died due to the virus - not counted simply because someone guessed that their death was caused by that?
And masks = less oxygen and fresh air, but plenty of carbon dioxide. I want to be exposed to the virus so my body will learn how to fight it, which is what most of a relatively healthy population is already experiencing with this virus. 
Our world economy and quality of life is being threatened  because of this unreasonable fear of a virus which has a relatively low possibility of death. What has happened to our global mindset? Our behaviors regarding this virus are illogical."
2020-07-24 17:06:15,"How is it acceptable to ANY American to open schools this early? Even with drastic PPE measures, many schools have poor HVAC systems and as long as even 10 students are congregated in any one room, they WILL spread the virus between each other and to their families at home. I find it UNACCEPTABLE that the current administration is playing politics with people's lives. Enough is enough."
2020-07-24 17:10:51,"At the beginning of this pandemic I was upset because the theme of many Republicans was that at 68; I was pretty much expendable. “Oh it is really only fatal for older people, or people with preexisting conditions. I even toyed with the idea that the Republicans were using older people dying as a mechanism to save social security. 
Now I am just angry that as an educational consultant who is actually qualified to understand what Betsy DeVoss has no clue about, no one seems to care about teachers dying. I am equally sick that this whole country is not up in arms about the number of healthcare workers deaths.
I visit many classrooms all over my state every year. There are generally 25 to 35 students in every standard class. Think about cramming that many people in a small corner of a Walmart. Private schools may have lower class sizes because parents are paying anywhere from 7000 to 25000 a year. Lower income people will not have enough to move kids even if public funds follow the child. All Trump is talking about is another form of segregation with the emphasis on keeping poor kids in poor public schools because money will be funneled to partial payment of private tuition.
Please think about the long term. Dead is forever. Educators and staff cannot be sacrificed for Trump’s re-election campaign."
2020-07-24 16:55:20,"What’s most frightening about the CDC’s revised guidelines is that fact the revisions are in response to a political calculus rather than a scientific calculus.

We are living the prequel to 1984."
2020-07-24 17:15:42,"All the benefits of kids being back in school matter nothing if your kid gets sick or brings the disease back home to infect vulnerable family members.  Moreover, teachers are rightfully scared to death to ""take a bullet for the president"" as a columnist put it, on the dangers of viral spread close to the source.

From everything I've read, the key way to stay as healthy as possible is to minimize exposure to others.  Even a modfied two days a week schedule is going to be safer than a full week--for teachers, as well as the kids themselves.

It's sounding more and more like a vaccine will be available in spring of 2021.  The president's insistence on everyone back to ""public"" schools is only to further his election.  Rich folks aren't sending their kids to school but want poor kids to  go so so the president can claim everything is back to normal.

How normal will that be if Covid-19 cases, and deaths, are traced back to the classroom?"

More like political cover."
2020-07-24 16:51:40,"And this is why no one trusts anyone in positions of authority any longer. If an agency tasked with promoting the public health can be turned into nothing more than a mouthpiece for irresponsible politicians with self-serving political ends then we have arrived at a very bad place. 

I’m hardly an anti-vaxxer, and I don’t believe Bill Gates is trying to inoculate all Americans with microchip tracking devices. But I do have very little faith in our now toxically politicized “regulatory” agencies. FDA approval of anything right now, for example, should be suspect, imho. So, I don’t know that I will be signing up to take a Covid vaccine anytime soon, and that’s not good. I should be responsible enough to do my part to bring this pandemic to an end, but I honestly have ZERO trust in our federal government as it currently operates. 

We don’t owe it all to Trump, I suppose. But he has certainly done more than his part in creating and nurturing distrust throughout our society. I’m not looking forward to dying, but I hate to think about what this nation is going to look like in 50 years (when my grandkids are about my age). I really don’t want to imagine America being on the trash heap of history, but sadly, that’s exactly where we’re headed."

2020-07-24 18:09:57,"The issue of returning to schools should not be a political one in any manner, shape or form. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends it, the CDC recommends it and Dr. Fauci ( NAAID) recommends it. Returning to school safely should be a universal goal. In areas where it is not safe remote learning must continue until transmission rates are sufficiently low. Those with pre-existing conditions should have the right to remain at home ( some teachers and fewer children). The caveats that older children may transmit more than younger children does not change the fact that all studies indicate children transmit Covid much less than adults and are less likely to contract it. Those vulnerable people at home have to exercise caution when around children who attend classes. As Dr. Fauci pointed out we may never eradicate Covid, even with a vaccine, so we may have to accept that schools reopen, for some, while we control the virus. Schools cannot remain closed indefinitely."

But those children who come from low income families have a much harder time learning virtually.￼ These children have not benefited from not being in the classroom and the longer this continues the more they will fall behind in learning. This is not fair to our children nor the parents.

2020-07-24 19:08:24,"Most of these purported benefits of in-school learning -- with, as an educator, I agree with -- are nullified by the CDC's own safety guidelines:
1) Social-Emotional: ""In an in-person school environment, children more easily learn how to develop and maintain friendships, how to behave in groups, and how to interact and form relationships with people outside of their family."" How is this possible when students CAN'T work in groups, must face forward at all times, can't even get close enough to converse with their peers? Never mind the psychological harm that could be done by criminalizing hand-holding and hugs.

2) Educational Instruction: Normally, students could benefit from cognitively-sound principals such as collaboration, and use of hands-on manipulatives. But, no groups are sharing are allowed under CDC safety measures. And we teachers could normally give individualized or small-group leveled/differentiated instruction and feedback -- but not if the kids have to stay in their seats and receive whole-group instruction only. 

Ironically, students might be able to have educational and social/emotional needs met better in video conferences than in a classroom restricted by CDC's safety protocols. At least they would be able to interact, socialize, collaborate, and receive small-group/individualized teacher instructional time... unlike an in-person classroom under CDC guidelines.

3) Nutrition: Schools are still providing meals to students, even during distance-learning."

ALL these changes have resulted in negative results. Trump was allowed to do these things because no GOP politicians, except for Mitt Romney, had the guts to stand up to him mainly because they believe his cult will not support them in their re-elections.  This is what happens when an unqualified clown gains control of a political party & the party caves in to dictatorial behavior & actions.  The mess Trump has created will take many years to reverse & Biden's first term will be challenging due to this mess & the totally mismanaged Trump led US response to Covid-19.
The GOP will continue to be irresponsible & try to block Biden's policies so the Dem's must also take control of the Senate.  Defeat as many GOP Senators as possible in the election for their idiotic support of Trump since he became president & his concerted efforts to become a dictator."

How does this help someone with no job, no income?   To the furloughed, the laid off, those waiting for their industries to reopen, it is a cruel joke, a brutal stab in the back.  To trump & co, we are invisible.

How does this address the critical budget shortfalls, added expenses, lost revenue, endemic to all of this?  It digs a deep hole deeper.

Logic tells us that in a classroom at best the size of a single-wide trailer, with 35 children, regardless of their age, is pure folly. Experience tells us that children in school share everything, from pencils to virus and will thus contaminate each other. Science tells us that while much is unknown about this virus, evidence suggests that school children can infect each other, their parents, siblings, grandparents, the bus driver, the cafeteria worker and the teacher.

Our Nation's Report Card indicates that we have dumbed down schools for years, even with five-days a week, in class study with a competent teacher, who must follow federal curricular guidelines. And testing.

It is bad enough that politically-motivated ""experts"" (Betsy?) have created a race to the bottom for students. 

But to have  science experts cave to the will of a leader who can identify an elephant on a cognitive test and boast incessantly about it, can well be sending out children to their graves.

￼Second perhaps American leaders and officials should take a page from the respect of duty and responsibility ingrained in Japanese culture and their politicians. To the extent that any American dies by following the CDC guidelines the individuals who helped publish these guidelines should kill themselves￼ as an act of taking responsibility for the reckless actions and attrition.

The problem with America, and it’s always been a problem, is that people are institutionally insulated from the consequences of their horrific actions.

This contains many declarations that are not experimentally or observationally supported, and indeed not supported in any way. This is not a scientific document. The statement is instead a setback for medical science, returning us to the Dark Ages, when supposition and folklore rather than careful study determined health practices.

The statement refers a few times to the perils of isolating children from public school, leading to ""harms ... on the social, emotional, and behavioral health, economic well-being and academic achievement... in both the short- and long-term, [that] are well known and significant"" without evidential attribution. If such conditions are so harmful, then this would argue to immediately cease home schooling, which has been practiced successfully for decades. Moreover, while kids are least likely to be infected by the virus, they remain at risk as carriers of the microbes, bringing them into the homes of vulnerable adults. 

While I note that other advanced countries have safely reopened public schools, they already had much less prevalence of the disease than here. I urge study in the US to weigh scientifically the risks of opening vs closing the schools, rather than simply dictate education policy by fiat. But such is the practice of the Trump administration, more unscientific idiocy."

>>>As governments around the world look to relax rules put in place to combat the virus, the experiences show how difficult it will be to keep outbreaks at bay. And they reflect, in some places, a weakening public tolerance for restrictions as the pandemic drags on.<<<

It seems that Europe proper does now get the bill for allowing more or less unrestricted travel. Let alone ad hoc public 'parties' of thousands of people in Germany (Frankfurt) e.g. annex the neccessary rioting.

Even those of us who are somewhat older now, have been young once. I remember that I thought 40 yrs ago that I was immortal. I did idiotic and dangerous things. Most of us did.
But somehow my generation had ingrained not to put others in danger.

These are very difficult times. There is no universal common recipe for all countries/counties/states. But it is imho essential that  there is transparence and that set rules are enforced.

The NL had special schools and basic schools opened fairly soon. Not full throttle and with precaution. That did not seem to have effected the infection rate very much. That the numbers are going up again now is due to parents who had to have their holy summerholiday from Turkey to Gdanks at any cost.

I am appalled to see that the so called “well being of youth and children in danger” does not extend to keeping them, teachers and parents alive in the bargain.

My husband and I agonized in the days after the election about leaving. I knew in my bones that it would become a matter of literal safety and survival if this man were in power.  We talked with many friends trying to make the same calculus.  

Another teacher and I talked about the real lessons of the 1930s, of when one knows lives depend on getting out and why so few in Europe did. We realized that part of it is that one risks looking foolish if making the choice too soon, but leave it too late and it's...well...too late. 

This pandemic and our inexcusable, colossal failure in dealing with it rationally have confirmed how appropriate our alarm was.  My family would be appreciably safer if we'd listened to our guts then. I tried to do research but got hung up on how to manage the care of aging parents, find a job, find a place that would take us, etc.

The process of trying simply affirmed for me why I've always considered refugees and immigrants the bravest people in the world. Turns out leaving a country-- even when you know it poses a threat --is much harder than it looks.

Not one word I read by our government trumped knowing China was building a hospital in ten days. My compass was right.

Fauci's guidelines of a month ago called for 1) social distancing 2) masks at all times 3) not staying in the same space for extended periods of time and 4) avoiding venues were speaking, shouting, singing take place. It's an absolute given that schools cannot provide ANY of those safeguards. 

I've listened to Dr. Gupta and a Yale epidemiologist explain this week that sending children back to schools is ""reckless"" and ""dangerous"" and they have no intention of sending their own. I'm keeping my own daughter home from college on all of the above data.

""Scientific studies suggest that COVID-19 transmission among children in schools may be low.  International studies that have assessed how readily COVID-19 spreads in schools also reveal low rates of transmission when community transmission is low.  Based on current data, the rate of infection among younger school children, and from students to teachers, has been low, especially if proper precautions are followed.""

Key phrases: ""Scientific studies suggest...COVID-19 transmission among children in schools MAY be low.""  


""International studies...reveal low rates of transmission WHEN COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IS LOW."" (Apologies for the all-caps.  There's no italic option here.)  It's not unreasonable, then, to suppose that when community transmission is high, as in numerous hotspots here in the U.S., we can most likely assume higher rates of transmission among children.

""...the rate of infection among younger school children, and from students to teachers, has been low, especially if proper precautions are followed.""  Likewise, one can infer that in communities that scoff at the idea of taking basic precautions (masks, handwashing, social distancing) that those rates of infection will be higher.

Perhaps more to the point, what's behind the change in CDC's tone? Did Trump threaten to withhold funding from them as well?"

In my area, just outside San Diego,  we have had 480 cases overall.  None has been  in the 0-19 years of age demographic.
Because of the announcement given by our Governor that schools should not open due to our State's outbreak of new cases,  the local school district has now pushed back the date for any type of schooling to September.... and yet this area has no cases reported in the school age demographic.
Children and youths are out and about everywhere and, if they were as infectious or infected as people say, would they not have spread the virus to their families and friends already been contact traced, tested and shown up in our local figures?
Instead of random,public testing areas with hours of people lining up, there should be a concerted effort to test all school kids and the relevant school staff, quarantine those that have it, and plan to get the others back to school.
Unfortunately, there is just continuous discussions about how to do this, with no actual plan at all. The teacher's unions and administrators seem incapable of action... being fully paid throughout this period does not incentive them."

2020-07-24 20:10:23,"Okay, folks, let's consider the fact that the CDC is embarking on a grand experiment.

Schools in much of the South and Southwest will be opening by mid-August.  And the CDC has recommended ""full reopening"" with kids and teachers in classrooms, cafeteria workers in the kitchens, bus drivers behind the wheel and janitors cleaning up ""after hours"".

In other words, an ""all hands on deck"" approach.

Now, schools in the Northeast and other regions, by and large, do not open until after Labor Day.

So there will be approximately three or four weeks between when schools in the Sun Belt open and those in the North.

Three weeks will give us enough time to see if the infection rates among adults in schools (eg. those teachers et. al.) and the parents, grandparents and other caregivers of those kids contract Covid.

The ""findings"" will help inform school officials and others in the North what they should do.

So let's all thank the CDC for undertaking this ""real time"" experiment.  Turning Sun Belt kids and their educators into lab test subjects is an inspired idea to inform us of correct pandemic response management!"

Lacking the testing and contact tracing of other countries and the better thought out plans based on those resources what are we doing here? Just beginning to take a shot at 500,000 dead, never getting Covid under control, completely ruining the country. Please enlighten me.

Also We are part of the big three, Brazil, India and the U.S. accounting for more than half the worlds cases. Look at the company we keep. Not exactly the most advanced countries in the world but all three run by narcissistic morons with a bent towards authoritarianism."

2020-07-24 20:23:04,"I had the opportunity the other evening to listen in on a school board meeting. It was my daughter's first time as a director of special education. 

It was fascinating to listen. The directors were all sharing their plans to reopen schools. None of them actually promoted anything other than pathways to at least set up a hybrid system if it was possible. However, they also were pointing out that they are developing their plans without any idea of what the Governor was going to do. So the were gearing up for online. 

Special Education is a completely different animal. The laws are pretty rigid when it comes to SPED. I was actually impressed (granted, I am biased) that my daughter had her teams of SPED teachers already developing back in April and May the tools needed to have these children continue their education regardless. With the needs of these children it is apples to oranges in public ed. But she understood back then that communication is key to success. Information Technology plays a big part in all of this with both the SPED kids and the other students. She has to make sure that sightless children can still be online. Or deaf children or those with CP or other motor function issues. Bottom line, SPED kids need SPED tools. IT plays a big part. But most of what I heard was parent involvement. Parents would feel much more in control if they were allow to see as it happens what plans may be. I could go on but the jist of it is online can work. Parents can make it work."

Science tells us that while much is unknown about Covid-19, evidence suggests that school children can infect each other, their parents, siblings, grandparents, the bus driver, the cafeteria worker and the teacher.

Our Nation's Report Card indicates that we have dumbded down schools for years, even with five-days a week, in class instruction with a competent teacher, who must follow federal curricular guidelines. And testing.

It is bad enough that politically-motivated  ""experts"" (Betsy?) have created a race to the bottom for students.

That's assuming unemployment offices can even implement the change. Highly unlikely.

If Republicans really wanted to pursue this course, they could have started updating unemployment offices when the last package was passed. They had six months. Now its too late. The Republican proposal means lapsed benefits for who knows how long. Seeing as the flat benefit took weeks to execute, you can guess the new method will take months before beneficiaries receive a check. That's before we start discussing the ongoing problem of accounting for people in the gig economy.

The suggestion is not only regressive but cruel and absurd. Sounds like standard GOP operating procedure."

The  military academies are small institutions with healthy students because of the physical training demands. The decision to be on line has been presented as better for the students and the way to keep the staff and community safe to avoid overwhelming the local health care system. All academies have mandatory mask policies, wide spread testing, contact tracing systems and extra budgets for janitorial staff.

With the CDC  clearly no longer an objective body recommending public health policy on the basis of medicine and science do we even need it anymore?

Trump and his right-wing minions have succeeded beyond belief in dismantling much of the domestic side of the Federal government.

If kids go back to school the infection rate will climb and more Americans will get the virus and then spread it.  What to do?  

Many teachers are going to refuse to go back to work. Their unions are strong, well funded and not sympathetic to the machinations of the trump WH. Families who depend on schools for child care should be given an option to home school their kids, using an online or public television delivered curriculum and receive federal support to help pay their bills...until we have a vaccine. Perhaps a provision like that is in the $3 trillion House bill that was passed in May.  Americans are creative and imaginative people...this problem is a temporary one that we can deal with until a vaccine is widely available.  The utter failure of the trump administration and the R Senate to address this very serious challenge is another in their long list of failures that have negatively impacted the American people.

How many times must they fail the common conservative before realize the ruse they run? Republicans convinced half the country to hate Obamacare but they still liked the affordable care act — and, despite years of calling it the end of America, they couldn’t repeal and replace it as never came up w another idea. Or, how about sequestration, which led to across the board cuts of the entire gov except the military? Can’t shoot or blow viruses tho. In fact, wasn’t the overblown coverage of the swine flu and Ebola what led many conservatives to disavow CNN? Conservatives were criticized rightfully after calling for closing of borders...that all led to this point. Still unable to do much other than criticize the gov, republicans are now asking for another bailout from dems. And if dems dont, they’ll get blamed. Dems passed a package a month ago. It’s not their fault that reps didn’t even want to talk about another one.

And if someone, as probably most have, permanently lost their job why do Republicans switch the narrative to claim that they are being paid to sit at home?  Maybe it's the Senators who should be looking for new jobs?

With all the horrible actions and statements by the administration on health insurance, even more bizarre during COVID, we shouldn't neglect to see that somehow the administration has produced something correct in  the Trump drive towards price transparency, where the face off is against special interests.

Once-in-the-trenches Times contributor Elizabeth Rosenthal has said so herself:

 (Every little thing from a stint in the hospital appears, like 

""HCPR REPAIR INTERMEDIATE N/H/F/XTRNL GENT 12.6-20 CM"" ,

and costs are list, which no one except perhaps the uninsured, actually pays.)

But if you search the web, it seems the administration has plans to do to-insurer prices, total, for some hospital procedures.  Which could help.

(There have also been plans by the administration, to get drug prices posted, partly to publicly shame drug companies.)

The effect of these is small.  The ACA is still needed if we can't get S. Payer.  

We'll see, if we get Biden, if he follows through, or caves to special interests."
2020-07-24 19:58:10,"This line “That document classified as “highest risk” the full reopening of schools” is very misleading. The document simply says that full reopening is highest risk compared with partial reopening or remaining closed. Not that it is highest risk compared to many other things. 

The way it is presented here implies the internal document states something is highest risk in some larger context and the public version is sending a different message. 

Errors and misleading statements like this are the reasons many right wing opponents of the Times suggest it is biased. This sort of misrepresentation or mistake calls your motives into question."

Yup! Republican corporate servants. And of course lots of money is being invested in corporations anyway, and why? Could it be big business is still exporting jobs and wealth with the current excuse of disease? You know how hard it is to get a new job. The companies likely enjoy all the cash flow without the expense of employees everywhere. And you know, if companies don't hire back, there will be no demand so why is everyone sitting out the trouble in areas where they can get going again? I don't wish to push beyond safe limits, but with all that borrowing, people in safe areas should the take initiative to recover.

Sweden allowed schools to remain open this year for elementary age children and those up to age 15 as well. They closed gymnasium (16-19) and universities. There were no systematic spikes of infections related to schools but there were some infection clusters. But Sweden wasted an historic opportunity to measure the risks scientifically. See article -

All so he can get re-elected to a job he never wanted and for which he is supremely unqualified

Meanwhile Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are trying to force people to return to jobs that no longer exist by withholding unemployment payments.

His handling of the virus is bad enough, but his manipulation of science to confirm with his political messaging and goals will doom the cure. 

There is no doubt the risk of reopening schools is significant.

Don't count me among who think the economy won't come back when the pandemic is over. Real estate in some areas is already rebounding due to people adapting their living spaces to working from home. The Dow is good. There are stores reporting excellent sales. Especially online.

The economy didn't crash. It was intentionally shut down. The fundamentals will still be there. But in the meantime we need to make sure everyone is taken care of. Forcing people to take risks will make the pandemic worse. And without a remedy, that's also dangerous for the economy."

Stop toying with American lives and the States' and Municipalities' abilities to fund critical services and keep them in tact. Fund the Heroes Act! Stop holding Americans and their families hostage to your cynical and frankly extraordinarily corrupt political antics. You and your Republican cabal in the U.S. senate have had two months to review and offer a counter proposal to the Heroes Act passed in the House by an overwhelming majority in May. While you are playing games and pushing false narratives about how extending the $600 UI aid is incentivizing Americans to stop working, thousands of Americans are dying from covid19 and millions are facing homelessness and a loss of healthcare coverage. The only reason it might take WEEKS to pass another aid bill is because YOU are unwillingly to do your job. You prefer gridlock. You prefer giving money and tax breaks to hedge funds, corporations and the wealthy at the expense of our greater common good. That's why Republicans won't re-open access to Obamacare or allow people to enroll early in Medicare.That's why Republicans are pushing to terminate Obamacare in the courts. By separating out a temporary and reduced UI aid package, you are trying to intimidate Pelosi and run roughshod over House Democrats and the Heroes Act they crafted and passed. They did their job. How many more Americans will get crushed before you do yours?"
2020-07-25 00:55:34,"Where to begin???
Don’t want to repeat what so many have said, so I will offer a thought.
Trump & Co. have sacrificed the health and welfare of our country.
The bible fiasco in Lafayette Park, the loss of our military at the hands of Russian “contractors” in Afghanistan, the unmarked cars and unidentifiable militia in Portland.
Trump, his policies and his minions have caused the death of 140,000  of our fellow Americans, due to his refusing to take responsibility for marshaling our resources to combat this virus. They should be charged with 140,000  counts of manslaughter.
ENOUGH!
It is time for our four former presidents to issue a joint statement condemning what Trump has done.
The time for not criticizing a sitting president has long passed.  Trump clearly does not respect his predecessors.
Presidents Carter, Clinton, Bush and Obama need to speak out in defense of our country.

Trump sends his son Barron to a super-expensive private school. It has decided to not re-open its classrooms. That's the way Trump likes it.

They were so proud of themselves, congratulating each other and laughing!
Fast-forward two-and-a-half years and those Republicans can’t quite muster the same enthusiasm for working class Americans battered by a botched pandemic response and a cratered economy.
We might get to it in a few weeks, says McConnell.
But we don’t want you living high off the hog, living it up on $600 in relief, more than your regular job pays you.

None of this is really about your child’s education.  It is about business.  It is about you getting back to work to help the economy, aid Trump’s re-election and make the wealthy even wealthier.  Ask the politicians and the rich how many of their kids and grandkids are returning to the classroom.

Israel tried this tack and learned the hard lesson that re-opening schools is about exposing more people to the virus than is necessary...not just the kids, but their parents when they go back to work.  They had to pull back.

Good economies need support and infrastructure to keep them growing and self sustaining.    We need to think about creating a living wage for workers in the next few years.    

Not just on a state by state basis where in Southern States a worker receives 8.00 an hour at the local subway and in NY 12.00.

Policies that continuously fail to intervene on behalf of workers, leaving housing, healthcare, wages,  childcare, and equitable workplaces up to market forces skirts disaster.   

We need our elected people to protect working people while stimulating business sectors.     These interests are not opposed to one another.

This will require 70  hours of work for myself and each of my pharmacists, week in and week out. When the second wave comes, will we be as lucky as our coworkers, who survived the virus and recovered? 

My friend in the hotel sales industry has not worked a single day and has taken extended out-of-state vacations, art classes, online courses, and got physically fit in his abundant free time, all the while receiving $4000/mo. since mid-March, courtesy of NYS unemployment and the federal subsidy.

Four months ago, we decided to spend three trillion dollars to buy time so we could get the virus under control and reopen the country. We then proceeded to do nothing to get the virus under control. Remember contact tracing? Nationally speaking, didn't happen. Remember flattening the curve? Didn't happen. Remember simple mitigation strategies like wearing masks? Don't get me started.

The rest of the world, with intelligent leadership and people, did what was necessary. They sacrificed temporarily and are now reopening. We preferred magical thinking, and now we find ourselves with a quarter of the world's cases and an infection curve that looks like the price of Tesla stock. 

And what are we doing? Arguing about whether to spend another trillion or three - again - to keep people from economic ruin - again - but nothing - again - to solve the underlying problem that will force us to do it - again - four months from now.  Keep the patient on life support, but don't cure her. Repeat as necessary until someone recognizes reality and pulls the plug. We have become the Terri Schiavo of countries.

We cannot fund the economy forever through government spending. We also cannot reopen the economy, or schools, until we do what almost every other government on the planet has managed to do: control the virus.

Add to this the fact that these schools are rural and poor where they can't afford even the most basic supplies for kids to stay safe, and what do you get?  Schools that have no choice but to open. In rural MN, those that live in areas like this have not had any instruction for their children since March.  Nada. Zip. I ought to know; my great nieces and nephews have done this. So what choice do they have?  They want to open, full throttle, because what else are they going to do?  Add to this our legislature, specifically our Republican 
MN Senate, that won't add money to help, and you've got a recipe for disaster.
Broadband should have been considered critical infrastructure by both Democratic and Republican administrations alike.  We don't have the nationwide access to 4G or 5G that is needed for schools to successfully distance learn. 
Schools need to be federally funded, period, so no district is cash rich and another cash poor.  That no matter where you are, your kids gets the education they need and deserve. We are shooting ourselves in the foot by not fully funding education.  And that includes making sure every district has the broadband they need for kids to learn.

The same group of people do not have much savings and were being hit the hardest during the pandemic. Meanwhile, they can neither understand what the media means by statistically significant, trailing average, etc. and might not be able to understand the risks that they are facing.

It may be too early but it appears that the masking and social distancing strategy is working.

But...

We all need to understand that this does not kill the virus, it simply controls the rate of contagion if we have the discipline to follow the rules long enough.
It will take some time,8-10 weeks typically, for the new case levels to decline to pre-surge levels.

Then...and only then...

Can we talk about reopening.

And.. the reopening must be different. It must be phased and faithfully tuned to early statistical indicators of increased contagion rates.
Then...we must hope and pray for an effective vaccine or effective, efficient therapies.

Talk of opening schools is callous in the extreme regarding the lives of teachers, administrators and other school staff. It must wait until we have contagion rates under control."

2020-07-25 08:12:01,"Now that Trump is recommending masks and taking the virus more seriously, his supporters will be faced with the task of making sense of his turn. Some will adopt his attitude and deny that any change has happened.  But many of his supporters have adopted attitudes about how serious the virus is on the basis of identity politics, and now Trump is asking them to abandon that identity for another.

Until most of the people in Trump states start taking the virus more seriously, the virus will continue to be out of control.  Trump world does not have the sort of discipline of the Stalinist Communist Party, which was able to order its members to turn off opposition to Nazi Germany and then turn it back on.  So Trump states and areas are likely to be bothered and plagued by the virus after blue states have gotten it mostly under control, especially if travel restrictions and quarantines can be enforced.  

In this result, one can see the hand of Divine Providence.

We will see if most Trumpsters can adjust their political ideology to follow the advice of experts without shattering the cult's spell's hold on them.  The alternative is to keep the rejection of masks and see Trump as having yielded to pressure and sold out his ideals.  This, too, will strain and perhaps shatter the cult's spell and its hold on them."

As the virologists and epidemiologists cooperate and share their (developing) knowledge globally, the incomprehensible difference can only be contributed to whether or not the respective administrations and political leaders follow the scientific advice and do their job by organizing an efficient and speedy management of the pandemic - on federal as well as state levels, and irrespective of party lines and political differences. This pandemic has clearly shown that  government, and only (good) government, is   capable of handling and (hopefully) eventually solving a crisis of such a dimension - medically as well as economically and socially.

If we became more fluent in math and sciences, perhaps we could keep this in better perspective. At this rate, the only way out of this is going to be technology/science — a vaccine or treatment.

Similar to how there were multiple duplicitous narratives in the op-eds on COVID, there seems to the same happening around climate change. 

Instead of railing against the ‘techno-industrial system,’ why not center the narrative on hitting the 1.5-2°C goal by any means necessary, including those yet to be devised — even the niche hippie utopia approach.

The result has been a kind of numbness to the sort of things that in times past would've generated widespread outrage and action.

It's as if the entire country has internalized Trump's own inability to focus for more than five minutes on any one thing. It works for him; but it's disastrous for us. The process of trying to attend to it all becomes exhausting and paralyzing.

And now it's escalated to such a degree that we've become inured to the unthinkable.

To date, a reported 148,490 Americans have died from the coronavirus -- yet Trump can brag that he's done a great job without the majority of Americans becoming infuriated and screaming for his removal from office.

If a nuclear device exploded in an American city and killed all its inhabitants, it would be mourned as a horrific catastrophe.

 Do any of the people getting the tests actually know, from day to day what their status is? If a person tests ""negative"" for the virus-that still means they could get it, next week or next month.Eh?
Every one of these ""tests"" may have little meaning as we don't know whether people can reinfect and/or, if people testing negative, may get sick in 6 months.
Somehow, I think we ought to call this a panic-epidemic, as our worst problem seems to be panic from whether we will ever work again, and when enough testing is enough?

Results would be available within hours, as each school district would have testing equipment and supplies, and school nurses would oversee sample collection.

2) Safe distancing indoors 10 feet from each other and 6 feet outdoors.
3) Hygienic practices which would included hand washing whenever anyone or anything thing is touched without disposable gloves. If that is not possible profuse use of hand sanitizers.

Countries like South Korea and certian states in the USA that prematurely assumed the Coronavirus 2 has left the planet or that the summer heat will boot out the virus are likely to see the biggest and remember Mark Twain's quote. The news of the demise of Coronavirus is highly exaggerated. Not until the WHO declares Coronavirus dead all safety precautions should remain in place. The last time the WHO declared any viral disease dead was in 1978 when small pox was declared dead. The WHO may have been defunded by the USA but it is still the equivalent of the famous lady that sings to declare the end of the Mardi gras event. The eradication of small pox took over 200 years after the vaccine was introduced by Edward Jenner. There are several vaccine candidates, the last count was 125 and the US govt has shoveled billions into a couple of chosen few.

IF - the US Educational Systems and US Dept of ED had actually embraced technology as an innovative means to forge a new way of teaching - then we'd not be stuck in this place of it not working so well. 

IF tech was not treated as an expensive ""text-book"", as an apparatus added to the class room. And demanding students and teachers stick to old norms of how teaching should be, but rather a means to create a new border-less classroom, where schooling was done in a brick and mortar setting as well as home - there would not be these problems of non-classroom learning not working now.

We'd have about 3 generations of students, teachers and parents already adjusted to a new normal. To a new paradigm, where students and parents would already be using technology and being more comfortable with non-classroom based learning.

Like most of our absorption of technology, its done very little to improve and fulfill the promises of modernizing how we do most of what we must do in our lives. MUST DO. We must educate our children, but we didn't embrace technology to truly do it better. We dont have to order food delivery.

The increase in infection rate is proportional to the increasing number of tests. We are headed to reach 1 mil test a day. So, we can expect the 73,400 number will larger. According to the CDC, some forecast see an increase over the next four weeks but others predict a slight decrease. Inside of those predictions are a lot of variability. We do know that we have had an increase in hospitalizations in some states. Most of those states have reverse the opening up plans. We also know that other countries, including some that have been praised in the past by news agenesis like the NYT, are having infection numbers rise. It is becoming clear that just staying in place, etc. is not going to wipe out this virus.

2020-07-23 12:59:33,"All of my favorite stores are going bankrupt. I went into Tuesday Morning yesterday, and it was empty. The sales clerk was crying and trying to hide it. She said they were going out of business. People not making it through covid is awful, but the job loss and what is going with it is right up there as well. Very tough times. I don't think the retail sector will be the same after this."

2020-07-23 13:12:37,"Think shopping center owners’ greed helped to bring about the demise of the mall. In addition to the basic rent it chargers, merchants also pay a percentage of their sales. 

In addition the mall owners charge prohibitive parking fees to shoppers. Went to a Simon mall in white plains, NY yesterday. To avoid the parking fee I parked a few blocks away. As such knew my visit would have to be curtailed due to the two hour limit on the street. 

If anything, shoppers should be encouraged to linger not limited by time to save on the prohibitive fees. 

Shortsightedness"

2020-07-23 13:17:47,"The description of their target customer is baffling and seems incorrect. As a mid-fifties professional woman whose job requires business formal attire, I spend a significant amount on work clothes. I have looked but never been interested in purchasing anything at any of these stores.  Their prices were sky high but the quality and style was poor. My professional wardrobe has mainly been purchased from Macy’s which carries Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfilger, Nine West brand suits and work dresses at similar prices."
2020-07-23 13:24:22,"I was the first manager of eCommerce and Online Marketing at Ascena's now-defunct brand Dressbarn at the turn of the millennium.

The ownership and board of directors, in spite of our having exceeded all initial goals for the e-commerce channel, insisted they knew better and that their business model of strip malls and newspaper coupons would last forever.

In a later job search, I was told by friends, colleagues, and the headhunter with whom I was working that my upcoming interview with Ann Taylor would be based as much on personal appearance as on my qualifications.  At the time I was carrying a fair amount of extra weight.  When I got to the interview, the hiring manager claimed to not even know an interview was scheduled.

It is with no small sense of schadenfreude to me that Dressbarn and now Ann Taylor and the rest of the brands acquired during their acquisition spree are now bankrupt.

I feel badly for the thousands of people working in the stores and distribution centers.  The Jaffee family and their minions who ran the whole thing into the ground, not so much."
2020-07-23 13:24:58,"Once upon a time, Ann Taylor had beautiful, well-made clothes. Something changed. The quality went down, but the prices didn't. I used to wear a lot of Ann Taylor, but I haven't bought anything from them in 10+ years. Maybe one of the positive changes from COVID will be the separation of the wheat from the retail chaff."

As long as   the garb is clean, doesn't risk being snagged on some equipment and covers all the right bits, it should make no difference."

More correctly, in the age of the pandemic, the ventilators were needed elsewhere.

One thing all these ""mall stores"" have in common is high debt. They've been financial houses of cards for years. And the more money the banks can loan them, the more they can claim they've increased their profits because they've got more interest income coming in. But there comes a time when the juggler has to put his baseballs or bowling pins down."
2020-07-23 13:45:26,I purchased my first suit at Ann Taylor over 30 years ago. I was a loyal customer for years . I can attest that the quality of the clothes has been on a downward trend for years ! I recently discovered their bi-stretch pants and suiting which remind me of the clothes I used to buy. The denim has been on a decline for years . I take special care of my 3 fav AT jeans which were long discontinued .  Loft  clothes are hit or miss though my daughter loves to shop there.

2020-07-23 14:02:41,Ann Taylor clothes were once uniquely cutting edge & well made. Usually there was a wait to get into a dressing room. Then - the clothes became standard knock-offs of cheaper ubiquitous brands - nothing special. Corporates beware - customers do notice these things!!
2020-07-23 14:10:29,"I don’t consider Ann Taylor, and certainly not Loft, premium high priced. They also always have great sales. Ann Taylor has the classic office clothes, nice accessories, while in Loft you can find some really stylish and trendy pieces. The pants and jeans fit great. I hope they don’t close my nearby store."
2020-07-23 14:11:53,"Speaking an older female American in my seven plus decades of life on planet Earth I have seen women's clothing prices rise to astronomical prices - clothing made by cheap labor offshore with cheap materials.
Cheap labor and materials does not appear to impact prices that as passed along to the American consumer.
I wonder what would happen if wholesalers decided to cut prices down to an affordable level and passed those prices along to the retailers? 
I wonder if it would preserve the tax base and the investor's interests in the retail operations to cut profits - even temporarily?
Of course, that is probably too much to ask that wholesaler's cut their profits so that retailers can remain afloat. 
The easy solution is never one of first choice when it comes to profiteering and avoiding paying taxes.
I'm sorry to see these two stores in financial difficulty. They don't deserve it and neither does the American consumer."

The Circuit City building would be easier since it's a stand alone basically metal structure. I think as the world heats up vertical farming will gain traction.
And those awful asphalt parking lots. Time to look at those and the run-off as well."
2020-07-23 14:25:45,"I still own--and treasure-- some vintage Lane Bryant pieces from the late 1990s.  Those pieces were classics and stood the test of time.  Quality stitching, top-notch fabrics.   Even as I've lost and gained weight (more times than I'd like to share) those pieces could be layered or adapted to fit.  Flash forward to circa to 2010:  Cheap, flimsy fabrics so sheer that everything pretty much required wearing some sort of tank or second shirt underneath (because when I am at work I want to wear a shirt under my shirt under my blazer?).  The tide turned from providing higher-end fashion for a corporate environment to the same disposable clothes  found at Forever XXI or H&M; the difference was Lane Bryant's offerings were still priced as if they were well-crafted from durable materials.  It got to the point that I gave up on Lane Bryant. Even when they expanded to include smaller sizes, which by then I fit, I didn't bother to go because I could get better quality, smaller-sized clothes elsewhere.  

As for Dress Barn, I remember going there in the mid-70s with my sister (as it was based in Stamford, CT). In the '80s pretty much all of my suits came from Dress Barn. I'd still check in from time-to-time but Dress Barn turned into the land of elastic waistlines, no belt loops, all polyester.  Everything was unflattering; garish prints (plus sized section) and matronly.  Very sad to see what were two great retailers go out like that."
2020-07-23 14:32:52,"It is disappointing to see so many retailers fail. Fashion, to many women was and still is a bright spot. The creative use of fabrics, colors, textures that incorporate abstract, ethnic and designs throughout the centuries. I love nothing more than watching a well produced historical movie, and attempt to imagine how difficult it must have been to move through the streets with layers upon layers of fabric. Or the intricate lace patterns that flourished and the time to took to make them by hand. Cleopatra, Gatsby, Doctor Zhivago, The Last Emperor, The Titanic, Memoirs of a Geisha, and many more, gave us a look into different times and cultures and brightened our knowledge of the past. 
Little by little our world is becoming just one culture. The Euro abolished the historical value of many currencies no longer in use. Dialects are also disappearing due to the diaspora of populations. 
How sad it will be to enter a world that leaves our senses flat ruled by Amazon and the Forever 21’s."
2020-07-23 14:36:28,"Well, let's be a little more careful here.

Like many fashion retailers of late, men's and women's, Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant are victims of their own incredibly foolish, not to say bizarre, decisions.

That they can now hop on the plague band wagon and seek forgiveness and additional funding is a distinguishing picture of the American economy and, especially, American politics.

These retailers did themselves in, and deserve to pass on.

Their workers, on the other hand, need and deserve the trillions of dollars Mitch and his gang of elitist robbers hand without conditions to corporations and wealthy individuals.  Trillions of dollars which contribute zero to the economy or the well-being of the nation.

In fact a case may be made, a strong one, that if Republicans had paid more attention to individual needs (all individuals not just ""the unemployed"") many of these traumatic closings would not have occurred.

There's still time to save our economy, as every single other advanced nation on the Earth has done, but our ruling class prefers to find secret and tawdry ways to funnel more and more money up the ladder, where it helps no one.  Not even Ann Taylor."
2020-07-23 14:37:43,"I worked at Ann Inc HQ in NYC for 6  months and decided to leave the company due to its instability. 
The way the company was run was disastrous. 

I feel bad for my former colleagues that are suffering. Some very bad business decisions were made, the merchandising team was very tunnel visioned and could have made better decisions to use liability/inventory fabric or materials- but would often oppose. Some high salary positions but not much output from those people. They let the vps of design go on lavish trips to europe, Japan, etc for “inspiration” blowing budgets....money well spent???

How much inspiration do you really need for when essentially at the end of the day we just copied Anthropologie??"

I started shopping and styling myself with the help of AnnTaylor and got multiple big promotions within a year. Funny thing was as I got into shopping and caring about my style sense, I put maybe 20% less effort into my work, but no one even noticed. They just noticed that I looked like someone that would fit in the Associates table. Ann Taylor helped my career out tremendously but the feeling of participating in the great  ""looksist con"" always made me depressed.

Those who live in the affluent bubbles of New York and Belair are a dwindling market."

2020-07-23 13:49:58,"For many years, Ann Taylor was my go-to store.  They had classic styles.  Then the quality declined.

My girl friend and I continued to visit AT after our monthly lunches.  But we haven't bought anything there is years; about 5 1/2  years ago, we stopped buying primarily because the style of the clothes became absurd.  We'd go in to laugh at the frilly blouses and those stupid bell sleeve shirts (really?  You think a working woman wants those things hanging over her computer?).  We moved on to those tacky blouses with the slit from the shoulder to the elbow. Then came the long, long skirts to be paired with short, short tops.  Lots of clothing that was completely unflattering.  Even all the tee shirts were too thin to be comfortable.

Our trips made us look at each other and say, ""They don't know who their market is.""  It certainly wasn't professional women over 45, and it certainly wasn't the 20-something crowd.  

I'm not one bit surprised they've folded.  But the failure does validate what we were seeing for years."
2020-07-23 13:17:32,"I’ll miss both Ann Taylor and the Loft. They provided me with a reliable stable of work clothes. Nothing too flashy or staid. Just fashionable, reasonably priced, mid quality clothes. This is a shame. Soon women in their 30-50s who don’t want cheap fast fashion will have nowhere to shop."
2020-07-23 12:45:51,Zero sympathy. This is why the fed should halt more large transactions like this. When you keep consolidating the industry through debt financed M&A well stuff like this happens when it goes south before you're prepared. We're seeing how poorly ran Big Corp is amd why they're horrible for economic stability.
2020-07-23 14:51:19,"A lot of folks are commenting here that we can turn these malls into affordable housing. They are ill-informed.

The malls that are closing are not Hudson Yards, Brookfield Place, The Mall at Short Hills, The Galeria, Westfield Century City, Phipps Plaza, Westbury Commons etc. They are not in expensive, housing-starved areas.

Rather, the malls that will close (known in industry-parlance as ""C Malls"" or ""D Malls"") tend to be located in areas where housing is cheap and plentiful, but well-paying jobs few and far between. Those areas also tend not to have meaningful levels of homelessness or housing insecurity. The homeless and housing-insecure tend to be in the highest-income parts of the country, like Venice, CA, Manhattan, San Francisco, or Washington D.C.

So the ""solution"" posed in these comments is not an actionable one to our housing crisis."
2020-07-23 14:10:21,"My sympathies lie with the store workers, warehouse managers and the underpaid people churning out thousands of articles of clothing that are destined for a few wears and then donations/landfill. Like many other brands, the quality has decreased while prices increase (ironically only to be ""slashed' with constant 50% sales).  If a brand doesn't value itself, why should a consumer?  And what was wrong with keeping to a set of consistent styles and cuts of staples like black trousers - so that when one pair wears out I can come back and get the same one and know the quality and fit will be the same? That's how you build repeat customers. Sad all around."

I worked in advertising for the separately-run catalog operation of Lane Bryant before it was acquired by Limited, which became L Group and is now also a casualty of changing trends and poor business decision-making.

Later, I worked for Charming, Inc., which owned once ran Charming Shoppes (gone), Fashion Bug (also gone) and then for Ascena, mainly on the Catherines business. It is sad to see the decline and loss of all these businesses, and I am sorry for my former colleagues, who were, like myself, trying to do our best work while seeing how poorly they were managed and how the product quality sunk ever lower."
2020-07-23 16:08:32,"What amazes me, is that major companies are ""knee deep in depth"".  When a crisis hits, they all fold like dominoes.  Their success was a false front.   They weren't propped up by profits, but by loans.

The millions of dollars CEO's were paid should never have happened. Going through bankruptcy, the salaries of top tier executives should be mandated to a base salary, for a job not well done.   Any company providing their CEO with a bonus, should not be allowed bankruptcy status."

But for these clothing retailers?  Honestly, nobody in my family, nor anybody I know, has shopped at stores like this in 20 years.  They have always been meccas of expensive, non-essential clothing, anchored into places like big malls that are a massive headache to get in and out of.  I am surprised that stores like this have survived this long.  The last time I used malls and brick-and-morter clothing stores was the late 1980s, and I'm not alone.  These companies did not shift to accomodate the obvious changes in peoples' priorities and shopping habits.  Good riddance."
2020-07-23 19:45:03,"I'm glad to see the Catherines brand is being auctioned off, rather than totally shut down. For decades it's been the main retailer focused ONLY on plus sizes.

""the company’s financial troubles preceded the pandemic.

Ascena’s troubles began in 2009, when malls were still in their heyday. The company set out to grab a larger share of the market for specialty stores in malls. 

Under the Ascena umbrella, the company acquired brands focusing on premium fashion (Ann Taylor and LOFT), plus-size clothes (Lane Bryant and Catherines) and girls’ clothes (Justice).

The acquisition of Ann Taylor and LOFT in 2015 was intended to bolster revenue by attracting customers willing to pay higher prices. 

Ann Taylor and LOFT had loyal followings in the past, but Ascena acquired them when young female customers were turning to online retailers and inexpensive fast fashion brands such as Zara or H&M, where they could pay $30 for a work dress instead of $100.

The acquisition stuck the company with more than $1 billion in debt without increasing sales.

The company’s diversification strategy backfired and Ascena ended up with a large portfolio of mall brands when the retail industry was shifting almost entirely online. 

It was this miscalculation that led Ascena down the road to bankruptcy.""

2020-07-24 00:36:48,"When I was a teenager growing up in the mall epicenter of northern NJ, Ann Taylor was to me a very chi-chi aspirational shop, located in a long-gone very upscale mall that had Lord&Taylor and B.Altman as the anchors.  I spent countless hours at that mall with my Mom, most of the other brands and stores also now long gone.  Still, I would occasionally shop at Ann Taylor over 4 more decades, in Ann Arbor where I live now, and elsewhere when I had 30 minutes to kill before a meeting in many US cities.  Even now, there are several pairs of black and navy pants, some sweaters, blouses and camisoles in my closet.  I hear and understand all the gripes about styling, quality, and pricing but, oh, to me it is just a bittersweet end to a long chapter in my shopping history.  RIP."
2020-07-24 00:37:36,"Greedy   Needy = Bankruptcy Speedy.  Don’t blame it on Covid.  Ascena’s acquisition strategy has been akin to the ad agency M&A mania of the 1980s.

Agree with Socrates re: should be a b-school course on How To Go Bankrupt 101, Retail edition.  Although I would probably use stronger language."
2020-07-24 15:08:26,"Bigger often is not better. Conglomerates and very large companies usually fold, and usually for the same reasons- too much debt and no focus on the customers and the products. General Motors and Sears are prime examples as are the myriad mall stores such as these. The dubious advantage of internet stores is that they can focus on particular niches if they are careful not to over expand. I say dubious because the sizing and cuts of clothing are entirely inconsistent, whether for men or women. This results in too much frustration and returns. If the internet vendors could agree on standard sizes and cuts, they would have a huge advantage that brick and mortar could not overcome. The Warby Parker virtual try-on is a first step in that direction."
2020-07-24 19:38:04,"What a shame. Back in the day, no visit to Ann Taylor ended without my purchasing at least one item, usually more! I noticed the decline in quality and style a few years ago but didn't know the reason why. 

Now I know.

2020-07-25 00:23:17,"I recall a full decade when Ann Taylor was an aspirational brand for younger women on their way up the corporate ladder; those who started their buying sprees of fast-fashion at Forever 21, looking to upgrade when they made more money.  Over the years, Ann Taylor had many competitors; from J. Crew, WHBM, Banana Republic to the trendy Kate Spade line. They basically had to change their styles to keep up with and compete with brands that became Instagram #OOTD darlings. Fast forward to 2020, and who even needs “professional” clothing when you’re working from home, staying away from malls, and not even getting close enough to anyone at the grocery store to notice what they’re wearing?  For many, shopping for anything other than basic essentials is a waste of hard-to-come-by money.  Boy, times sure have changed."

2020-07-23 18:24:47,"The rent moratorium is something that's way more complicated than is presented many times.  While large, well capitalized development companies that have dozens to hundreds properties are well able to get through this, the small landlords, especially the owner occupied double deckers of working class neighborhoods across America, even the small landlord who has two or three building and maybe 8 to 10 apartments are entirely different.  Their mortgages, their income, their ability to pay taxes and service their debt even put food on their own tables is directly related to their rent payments.  The large holding companies that own and manage complexes of hundreds of apartments is a whole different critter.  A moratorium without aid to bridge the gap was a disaster in the making."
2020-07-23 18:57:33,"What's the business of evicting a good tenant in a down market? As a landlord, you have to ask where do I get my next tenant from. If job loss in an area is widespread, that property could stay vacant, and rents can push down as well. If you can arrange with your tenant to pay what she can, you can maintain a business relationship with a known quantity and when relief comes recover. I would imagine you could write off unpaid rent. An eviction notice is the beginning of a proceeding that takes time, but culminates with property owner able to have the tenant removed. Is eviction proceeding now a hedge against a later hike in rents? Or, at an industry level, is this a negotiating tactic for property owner debt relief? Under any model, regular people suffer."
2020-07-23 20:39:09,"Since it makes no sense to evict a good tenant now, it strikes me that some of these tenants don't fall into that category.

Rather than reducing taxes many school taxes are going up along with increases in real estate taxes. Will our democrat leaders in NY allow property owners not to have to pay their taxes because of the lockdown? I have yet to hear one democrat leader in NY say they would refuse to get paid for the duration of this crisis. The democrats who run this state and city always want to protect themselves and renters and others who vote for them while placing all the burden on working and middle class property owners--and should I remind democrats in NY that many property owners in Queens, Bronx, Staten Island, Brooklyn are  immigrants along with struggling working families throughout NY state & Long Island.

The positive developments over the past two months demonstrate that people, not the invasive state, taking the appropriate measures - wearing masks, social distancing, keeping out of crowded places and isolating the most vulnerable - mean that we can have measured and rational re-opening that gets society and the economy running again.

Yet, this new trajectory of the pandemic does not support the authoritarian left and their enablers in the MSM since it highlights that their statism and radical agenda are counter to what America believes in. 

Why do you think teachers and their unions are so adamant about not coming up with a rational means of opening schools? By keeping schools closed and keeping parent in lockdown is a not so subtle measure to keep the pandemic as a 'disaster' going in to the November election."

I have lost both state unemployment and the $600 checks because I made less than $100 working part time.  
The $600 has been the only thing that has kept me afloat since the government decided only one job counts for income. Funny how I still have to pay taxes on that money though."

California aside, six reliably red states on Wednesday saw record numbers of cases and deaths. The president, though, continues to whine about appearances. And, of course, this ""Democrat hoax"" is driving his polling numbers into the sea, like an anchor. But, and here's the kicker: ""Watch, on Nov. 4, everything will open up."" That's both ludicrous and ominous.

The cynicism is nation-destroying. He is saying here, that after the elections, what has gone before, in the previous 10 months of his administration, will have been ""fake news,"" made up to satisfy the cravings of those who oppose him. He is not interested in getting involved in dealing with a disease whose numbers defy reason. 

Red state governors and city mayors gloated in the spring when New York City recorded just under 60K hospitalizations. But yesterday, almost as nearly the same amount of Americans were in hospitals on Wednesday.

The presidential ""leadership"" is astonishing. Yesterday he returned to his animus against testing just a day after he grudgingly admitted that Covid-19 attacks will get ""worse before it gets better."" 

I'm betting that the president doesn't care if it"" gets worse"" after Nov. 4, as long as he's still in the saddle. If that's the case, then we're all in trouble. It will never ""get better."""

2020-07-23 12:44:23,"In recent days there has been the renewed criticism of testing for the virus in the US.

One aspect of testing that isn’t being addressed is the process of scheduling tests.

In communities that are offering tests through local government agencies rather than a private entity, having residents call to schedule a test may not be the most effective means to perform as many tests as possible.

Smaller communities and even larger cities should have created a schedule based on databases that the cities and towns already have, such as “addresses”, rather than announce a testing site and tell people to call.

Creating test schedules based on addresses would be less burdensome to administer, and provide information on who has not been tested.

I am sure some communities had the foresight to plan testing in this manner, but when you read about people waiting in lines for hours still, lack of planning is evident.

Furthermore concerning tests, there has not been any reports or news if “air sampling tests” have been created to test and monitor indoor spaces for the virus. I recall who some communities are monitoring waste water at sewage plants to determine if the virus exists in a community, but additional means for monitoring the virus are needed.

Since there are methods to capture other airborne issues like mold spores, by now there should be methods to measure if the virus is present in an indoor space."

First, concerning large corporations (and their smaller LLCs who took most of the first CARES Act) -- nothing - use your taxbreaks and buybacks. legitimately small businesses - yes. Essential employees and those unemployed and suffering - yes. And, like Germany is doing, have events where the (4,000 or so) public agrees to be monitored so we can track the spread, find hotspots, mitigate and flatten the curve. This way, the public gets to enjoy life while assisting to solve the problem.  This false concern that extending enhanced unemployment is a demotivator to return to work is insulting when you consider that these same people, along with the employed, pay for congress's health care, salaries and vacation and inactivity. So, who's is voluntarily not working? It's them! There's not one of them who are not financially secure on our backs.

Millions of us made payroll taxes throughout our lifetime of work, for our subsequent Social Security benefits.  There will be a huge price to pay, and we will not stand for it, if Trump or Mnuchin attempt to do so, by subterfuge again.

The present ""talks and discussions"" occurring in Washington should have taken place in MARCH. There is never any long range planning, vision, or discussion with this group.  It's always after the fact. A deplorable situation has to occur for months BEFORE a discussion on how to address it even begins. But that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone since from the start, there was a shortage of PPE for medical professionals, testing kits and basic supplies for hospitals.

The situation just like you go to see a doctor in the medical office with an illness, but you end up seeing the office manager who makes the diagnosis and treatment recommendation for you.

In the first briefing, Trump presented with a more serious tone and read off the script to recommend mask and social distancing. The second briefing yesterday, Trump began to drift back to his mode of performance with lie and misinformation. He said is up to the governor to decide whether one should wear mask. Trump stated that children have stronger immunity and therefore not to spread the virus easily. The child's immunity is weaker than the adult because of immaturity but still can bring the germs back to the family members.

We deserve to hear the truth from scientists and physicians, not from politician. Going forward, Trump still has not offered a cohesive federal policy to mandate mask, authorize DPA to make PPE, mask, and test in which these equipment are still inadequate 6 months into the pandemic.

US is reaching 4 millions covid cases today and 150,000 deaths by next week. I am very concern if this surge is not contained soon.

This pandemic has exposed archaic and inefficient systems used by state unemployment departments (in their defense, somewhat, they have never had to deal with such staggering numbers of claims at once).

I hope Congress will extend the current $600/week at least as a short-term relief measure. The July 31 end date they passed is actually July 25 based on how unemployment certification weeks run. The virus is still here and sadly many job opportunities are not."
2020-07-23 17:22:27,"Here’s hoping that UNDP report gets more than a bullet point of attention. In a year filled with wake up calls, it’s shocking to see just how close we could be to supporting and lifting up over a billion of the world’s poorest people. 

As the pandemic lays bare the shambling skeletons of the worlds social safety nets, nearly picked clean through decades of quiet cuts and behind the scenes dismantling, perhaps there is a glimmer of hope shining from the other side of the mountain. A sparkle of a world in which humanity chooses to turn their backs on the greed and selfishness the wealthiest elites have spent decades successfully convincing many in the west was in their best interest. A world in which humanity at large chooses to love and support their neighbours and break the cycle of poverty."
2020-07-23 17:23:17,"We are leading the numbers of Covid-19s patients in the world.  And Trump now seems to suggest people should wear a mask and keep social distancing. It is too late that the damages have already been done.

There should be ample reasons why we spent billions of dollars on pharmaceutical companies in aiding and securing faster vaccine developments and dosages.  But any one of them could fail in the final stage. There is no guarantee.

Wouldn't it be easier for Trump to call his buddy, Xi Jinping, for a friendly chat about cooperation for the development and manufacturing of vaccine should China come out first in the final stage.  It may bruise Trump's ego a bit, but to save lives is much more important than his own ego.  Besides if the actual situation turn out to be the case, Trump will win popular support for his wise decision to compromise his personal ego for the sake of American lives. 

And all he has to do is to pick up the phone."
2020-07-23 17:34:12,"I would be good with an elimination of payroll taxes, as long as the bill prohibits - forever - any reduction in SS or Medicare benefits, as always adjusted for general inflation,  health care cost inflation, and cost of living. Those worried about how to pay for it all could always claw back the trillions in tax cuts for the rich that the GOP passed a couple of years ago."
2020-07-23 10:39:03,"143,000 dead and counting.  When will the American people finally wake up?  There are way too many people violating mask and social distancing mandate and worse, there is literally no enforcement of them, at least here in Pennsylvania.  Walmart, Lowes, etc. have announced mandatory masking but enforcement is non-existent.  People freely go in and out of the local stores without masks and social distancing and new occupancy rules.  Well the local Walmart parking lots are packed as full as they were before the pandemic.  There are several local small stores and restaurants that are completely ignoring the any mandate.  There is one small local restaurant that is packed full every morning with so many people that certainly are way beyond any occupancy mandates.

Bottomline, with no enforcement measures whatsoever or a change in the mindset of Americans, Americans are simply going continue to get sick and die in ever larger numbers.  Herr Trump may get his wall, but it will be built by the rest of the world to keep Americans from leaving America."
2020-07-23 12:09:26,"To think it’s only after this many cases that Trump finally says wear a mask is ridiculous. 

It’s how you imagine his bankruptcies going — the executives presented him with data along the way indicating trouble at the casinos, but he ignored it until the data got so bad that he couldn’t ignore it anymore — so he finally says, let’s fix it, but it was too late; they filed for bankruptcy (many times). 

This is how he manages; poorly to say the least — data would probably suggest he is the worst. 

...and so like with his casinos, his “management” of the coronavirus will bankrupt this country.  

If Biden wins, we will be spared total financial ruin, but if trump wins, we will not only be bankrupt, we will be insecure as a nation."

How many are unknown or unconfirmed infections?Lets assume without any real data that it is another 4 million who had the infection but never got tested and never had serious symptoms but still were spreading the Coronavirus. That would mean 2.4% of the US population has the infection. Insufficient to acquire herd immunity and so we need a deployable vaccine fast and we still need to take safety measures.

Let us look at mortality which is a more reliable number because no one can easily die without being noticed. 140,000 deaths in the US or 0.043% of the US population mostly (80%) over 65 years of age possibly all on Medicare for all above 65 have died due to Coronavirus  2, derivied from CDC mortality data. During the same period deaths due all causes other than COVID-19 was 10X of those due to COVD-19 and in excess of 1,336,473. This is after the shutdowns and the lockdown orders of govs. Death is inevitable mostly due to 10 different leading causes of  death among baby boomers . After knowing that persons over the age of 55 is the vulnerable group that needed to stay home and knowing that if everyone wore a proper mask properly, washed their hands with soap every time they touched something or someone and self isolated themselves, the business shut downs, lock downs and panic were totally unnecessary."

It has been said that Trump gets daily briefings by the Medical Taskforce prior to his television stints, therefore, the need to have them present is none, I contest this statement, Donald Trump has the intellect of a flea, the attention span of a frozen pea that rolls to the floor and hits the baseboard, and the lack of scientific and medical knowledge, he does have the gift of gab, as well as the ability to quickly detract, this is not what the American public needs to know, the majority want to know how I can protect myself and my family, why is it spreading so rapidly, is it safe to reopen schools and what is the status of the vaccine, when can we all get it and will it be safe, will we need to take the flu shot at the same time? Though the President is wary of testing and it's results, he feels too many are done, in Medicine the more data you receive the more you are able to understand, contain, and treat. Senator Lamar Alexander agrees more with the Medical Statements, now Trump has just accused the Democrats for not having tax cuts in this new package, yet Mnuchin Secretary of Treasury states it is presently too complicated to attach in this stimulus deal, however, it still does not address the everyday worker who is presently struggling with evictions, mortgages, rent, food, basic utilities, transportation needs, so what seems to be the problem is it typical Trump?"
2020-07-23 16:58:39,"Trump is devastating the United States.  It doesn’t matter that some places have fewer virus carriers than others.  People travel.  It takes only one carrier to start or restart a new round of infections.  While Trump discounts the virus for citizens, he and his staffs and family are tested frequently.  If he says he isn’t, remember, he lies - a lot - every day.

Needed:  Federal to local messaging regarding isolating at home, mask wearing in public, and being in public only as needed and infrequently, handwashing, regular testing and contact tracing.  If we do these things for three months, we can have this virus under control.  At this point, it’s going to take much, much more money to accomplish this goal but we absolutely must.  Waiting for a vaccine is not the answer.  While a vaccine will be wonderful, not everyone will take it and it will take time to get everyone that wants it vaccinated.  Also, efficacy will be a problem for awhile.  

Trump’s allowing this virus to take such a strong hold in this country is a tragedy and a crime of immense proportions.  It didn’t have to happen.  So much death, devastating illness and economic disruption and it means nothing to Trump, absolutely nothing.  If we really, really want to save lives, and the economic health of our country, Trump needs to go right now.  Letting him hang around for six more months will absolutely devastate our country."
2020-07-23 17:12:35,"The new jobless claim rise is unfortunate, though predictable, as businesses that had struggled to hang on can no longer continue.

Our health insurance systems fails to help enough.

This includes the ACA in its current form.  Single Payer has been deemed politically impossible, so we really have to fix the ACA problems.

We have miserable 91% ""coverage"", estimated dropping to 89%-90% with COVID.

Only about 1-2% in the uncovered number is due to 13 red states not expanding Medicaid.

The ACA has quite high premiums for people in common cases.  

I calculated last year a case, owing to the ACA ""subsidy cliff"" and higher age of a couple, a need to pay 40% of income towards premium and maximum copay for the cheapest plans.

(It was Chicago for a couple around 62 a bit over 400% FPL, but the same problem is common occurs in many cases.)

To boot, SERIOUS and IGNORED by most of the press since 2014, and I think by the Times never reported:

In many the states, the roughly 20% of people who get a Medicaid, including ACA expanded Medicaid as their ""coverage"" (income to 138% FPL no asset limit) don't get insurance at all in many states (incl. blue MA, MD,NJ) when they are 55 and over. 

They get just a loan, and their estates are on the line for all medical bills paid out when they die.

(Stunningly now, with the inability of African Americans to accumulate and pass on wealth in the news, and African Americans disproportionately affected, the press continues to ignore it.)"

So if there are 150 million people in the workforce, and 30 million are collecting UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, how can the unemployment rate be the claimed 14.7%, when 30 divided by 150 is 20%?

Oh, wait, … the folks who REPORT the rate of unemployment to the public are Trump appointees.  

Got it.  Mystery solved.  They offer lies, stupid lies, and easily discerned lies.

That also explains why some of us, who did the math based on reported unemployment claims in the aggregate of above 40 million about a month ago, now over 50 million, were puzzled by the asserted 14.7% rate at the time."

Now they are finally realizing that extractive capitalism may actually be killing the hand that feeds them (ie the middle class taxpayers, employees, customers) and the democracy that protects their property and profits.  Hence the Lincoln Project and Republicans Against Trump.

The irony that Republicans, even after all of this, can be stingy with returning middle class tax money back to the middle class in the form of relief dollars, while having no problem using middle class tax money to continually give the wealthy welfare payments (tax breaks and tax avoidance loop homes) boggles the mind."

1. Billions of Federal dollars set aside for ""private"" schools. Doesn't that make them ""public"" schools. I am against public funding for private schools especially while or public schools are in trouble financially. As soon as we get them squared away in terms of providing all the funds they need, then we can consider subsidizing ""private"" schools.
2. No funds provided for State and Local governments...he acknowledges that the Democrats will insist on inclusion of funds in the final package. Clearly McConnell does not care about funding police, fire, teachers, social workers...but he is willing to hide behind Democrats to take whatever blame accrues.
3. Farmers get an unexplained 20 billion dollars. Is this just a continuation of the China trade deal debacle or have farmers incurred special COVID19 expenditures?
4. Any aid to the states can't be spent on pensions and retirement benefits. Since we all know money is frangible, I don't know how you assure that this happens.
5. There are inferences being made as to the solvency of Social Security, Medicaid etc. This is an ominous signal that in the reckoning of the federal deficit after the pandemic the GOP will be looking for cuts to these programs which they have sought for years.

2020-07-23 11:45:04,"As the virus rolls over the US it seems several businesses are hammering nails in the coffin of the US economy.

If millions are evicted the landlords lose rent, if new tenants can't be found. Many landlords have mortgages to pay or are otherwise in debt. The US rental market and owners market might very well collapse if many millions stay unemployed with no or inadequate compensation. The troubles will inevitably spill over to mortgage industries, service providers and local taxation. It's just another downward spiral in the US economy.

This recession is of unprecedented scale in living memory, and the usual US trickle down of disasters won't work. When a society is hit that hard, everyone must take a part of the burden, and that includes the rentiers, the landlords, the banks, the ultra rich etc. 

In these dire times it is not about maximizing individual profits, but about keeping the society running in a sustainable way. If the US can't manage, everyone except a few disaster vultures will lose badly.

In the US you failed to protect jobs and wages. If you fail to protect homes as well, the US will fall apart. What are you going to do with millions of homeless citizens having lost virtually everything?  What about the children? The elderly? The lost spending? Ruined local authorities and states?

The US is not built to endure disasters, you can manage some comparatively minor ones, but when the entire nation is hit the US seems helpless."

Red states will continue to treat the virus casually, and infection rates she deaths will not stop.

2020-07-23 20:41:14,"While New York certainly didn't distinguish itself at the outset of the pandemic, the way we've managed to contain the virus in the New York region has been pretty exemplary in the subsequent months. Our numbers are down considerably and comparable to the numbers in countries that have managed to contain the virus and are beginning to reopen.

This took the effort of government officials (as dysfunctional and corrupt as NY state government is - and it certainly is both of those things - it still must be said that it's a functional and serious-minded government in times of crisis) and, as importantly, the cooperation of a public that was willing and able to think beyond its own individual needs (which kinda goes against the popular stereotype of New Yorkers, but those who live here know the residents pull together in times of crisis).

So the question is, why isn't the rest of the country emulating what is clearly working for us? I know Americans tend to  - sometimes stupidly - eschew looking at foreign countries for guidance, so why not look at the one area within our country that is seemingly getting it right? Is it because the governor has a D next to his name, and the president and governors of the most afflicted states simply cannot be seen to acknowledge that a D-run state may have done something right?"

Most people don't mind working, and actually enjoy being productive citizens. They just don't think it's worth risking their lives-or the lives of loved ones-to do so.

But, I’d like to give equal discredit to some of the governors of the latest hard hit states, because their responses to Trump’s “suggestions” and their desire to cull favor with him have led to the current situation. Refusal to mandate face masks, refusal to mandate social distancing, refusal to slow the opening of their economies and to control their citizens have caused havoc in the south and west with no end in sight. The governor of California, while not a Trump-follower, also opened up to soon, to quickly, and too loosely. So we shouldn’t regard our elected officials as all-knowing, understanding, and working for the common good. In many instances, Texas, Florida, and Arizona to be specific, the governors either didn’t get it, didn’t care, or were too afraid to disagree with Trump and too willing to sacrifice their citizens to the president’s whims. Political party affiliations must not and cannot comprise the reasons for making public health decisions, but apparently the Republicans believe that they should. The Texas lieutenant governor stated that he was not going to listen to Dr. Fauci. so who does he listen to? Chuck Woolery? Ask his fellow Texans how it feels to be infected and whether or not they should have followed the doctor’s orders. Ask them in Florida and Arizona, Georgia, Missouri, and on and on."

And yes, of course the virus will eventually eliminated although I can’t predict the exact date. And yes, of course the economy will start growing again and again I can’t predict the exact date but it will.

2020-07-23 19:39:14,"Dear Trump Republicans, elected and otherwise,

Trump is bringing you to the same place he brought his casinos investors — a dead end of ruin. 

The warning signs were everywhere — but you ignored them as deftly as he ignores data. 

His civilian supporters don’t know any better; they are not only bitter, but uneducated. 

Which is where elected officials are essentially supposed to step in; not actually to represent a constituency that is misinformed — but to honorably inform the constituency, and represent them based on their views of a real data set (and not some crack conspiracy theories).

You think you are doing the country a service by representing the misinformed — but you are only exploiting them because, in most cases, most of you actually know better.

...but you want the discord because you think it will give you power — but that discord, based on divisive lies, does not give the country power. It strips it of such. And it emboldens real enemies that you’ve given a pass to thus far. 

And this is the reason you are considered treasonous to this country — you want to strip it of its power and wealth yet you don’t realize the long lasting consequences it will have on the near and distant future — and if you think you do, you’re delusional about your own place in it. 

I certainly disagree with your views on guns, and other matters. But you have 100 days to abandon Trump if you want to survive. 

And Biden will win anyway — but you might keep your job too."

I felt I needed to express my sincere apologies for such ignorance not that it gives comfort or support, but keep on fighting in order to at least have the one thing that cannot be taken away once given, yes there may be trade-offs but the benefits outweigh them."

This year is no different. And the steady increase of Convid-19 cases within the Gulf Coast counties of Alabama and Florida speak to the absence of governmental leadership.
The various live beach cams along the beaches document that people are disregarding all of the REQUIREMENTS of local governments to wear a mask and to practice safe distancing.
People are gambling with their own lives and the lives of others and are doing it in spite of every effort to educate them.
Governors of Alabama and Florida should institute orders that serve to flatten the curve and that means closing the tourist areas until the cases are flat. Their failure to do this is killing people."

If school opens and even if I am reasonably satisfied with the precautions my child’s school is taking, the question I will be asking myself every morning and which will determine my course of action is, 
“If (when) my child or a student or a teacher or a staff member or ANYONE gets sick, can they get a rapid test, a hospital bed, a ventilator, the medical attention they need without waiting for a week?

There would be no other reason for this malignant narcissist, self absorbed, concerned how he is seen, to put on a mask... you don't tell a person with a God complex just to dress a certain way... you don't tell them to do anything.  If he indeed did take the hydroxycholoroquine and since he already has a bad heart (morbid obesity and fast food diet and well reported drug use), hydroxycholoroquine's side effect is heart failure. Heart Failure.

But even after all of that, since he is incapable of empathy, he pushes for more actions that will unnecessarily expose more people to the virus to include our children."

I had wounded my foot last night badly, from of all things, stubbing my foot on my exercise bike in my living room. Looking at my subcutaneously bleeding toe, I thought to myself, ""Thank God I have Health insurance"", and it pointed up a significant idea; if something can happen suddenly like that, would I want health care insurance to absolve me of the unpredictable predicament of sudden injury? Well, of course I have health insurance, and I will don slippers to venture off to a health care facility to tend to my wounded foot, but another thought occurred to me; if all the Republicans are willing to fight politically for their guns, then it is a given they would need health insurance to pay for the inevitable wounds. Can you imagine how much it would cost were someone to be wounded by a gun as many are now? Get health insurance. 

But more importantly now, with 4 million virus cases with a significant mortality rate, the odds are, even young people would be burdened with many thousands of dollars of hospital and medical bills that would bankrupt them for life, or at least ten years until the bankruptcy was erased. How can you not have health insurance, especially now?

I'm terribly concerned over this disease. It is not a Flu! It is spreading even more virulently in hot weather unlike a Flu that subsides in warm seasons."

If they are we need to understand what will happen next so that we don't get ahead of ourselves and ""reopen"" to soon again.

The process of case number decline starts with a plateau. That may last 2 weeks. It is followed by a long slow but steady decline which may last 8-10 weeks, The whole process, which requires continued mask wearing, social distancing and testing/tracing will thus take months. Deaths will lag cases by 2 to 4 weeks.

It will be late September to October before we can contemplate a phased/monitored reopening.

Out biggest problem will be Donald Trump who is incapable of following a set course for more than a few days. He will try to goad governors into reopening again prematurely. He must be prevented from ding so.

Nevertheless, here in Texas, the battle over masks rages as many legislators misconstrue a medical device as some kind of intrusion to the Bill Of Rights. Perhaps if the naysayers spent one day in my ICU they'd realize there is no reason for their ill advised position. People willingly wear seat belts, use condoms, and drug users are urged not to share needles. It's silly to misconstrue a 50 cent health device as an intrusion to their freedoms, but this is Texas where stubbornness seems to endure beyond all reason. However, Mother Nature will correct this problem as the mask free people & their families get sick and our ICU does not have the capacity to heal them."

Trump doesn't care. He's abdicated all responsibility for leading the country through a tumultuous time. He's ""bored with it."" He'd rather focus his energy on kidnapping citizens off the street in blue state cities.

Republicans don't care. They could pressure or overrule Trump to pass vital legislation. They could, with only a handful of defectors, vote in a new Senate majority leader. Instead, they collude to stop all attempts by Democrats to provide Americans with relief.

They are all happy to watch the implosion from a safe distance. Meanwhile, if Americans elect Biden, a Democratic president will once again have to clean up the economic and environmental fallout left over from a Republican administration."

There's only one way to limit the already severe damage to the US. And it is to get the virus under control. It will take herculean efforts and bipartisan unity, unprecedented in the US for many decades. By now the virus is everywhere, and it is much more difficult than 5 months ago. But it must be done now, never mind the upcoming election. If the US continue the current failure for another 3 months the damage will be irreparable for decades.

It is obvious the Trump administration can't fathom the depth of the crisis they've made. So the House and the Senate must take charge. Even for Republicans saving the nation must be put before defending an inadequate president and his regime.

Otherwise the US is carved up in states taking control of the virus, and those who won't or can't. It means travel restrictions and borders in the US as never before. The new passports will be recent negative tests. It means severe damage to the interstate US supply chain, economy and home market. It has already begun and will only get worse.

There's no way states having fought hard and expensively for control can tolerate open borders with states ignoring the threat and allowing the virus to ravage their states."

Wait! - where's the reporting on the 49 trials that show hydroxychloroquine works very well against C19 to save lives, and kills no one?

You'd think this killer drug has no studies showing it works well against C19.  Only ten people (not thousands) who took the wrong aquarium version died.

It's been on WHO's essential drug list for 65 years.  The major failed studies used near toxic does - up to 2400 mg for ten days.  You only need 200 mg.

Those studies did not use it with Zinc, which is why it works; it transports Zinc - a very potent anti-viral - inside the cell to kill the Virus.  

The countries that use HCQ have deaths per million under 200 (Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia, India, Malaysia).  Those that don't are over 500.

In an international poll of 6,227 doctors in 30 countries, 37% rated the HCQ as “the most effective therapy” for C19.  In Spain, where the drug was used by 72% of doctors, it was rated “the most effective therapy” by 75% of them.

Remember when the doctors all rushed to prescribe HCQ for themselves?  Why?

The protocol that kills no one and cures all: 200 mg of HCQ twice a day, 500 mg of azithromycin once a day and 220 mg of zinc once a day, for five days.  Easy and cheap.

At a 2% daily growth rate of 2% (< recent trend), cases double in 36 days.  At that rate in about 6 months half the country would be infected.  The current nationwide mortality rate is about 3.56%.  If the mortality drops to 1% (< current trend), but half the country gets the virus, the nation’s death toll is > 1,500,000.  According to a study, the virus can live in the body for up to 37 days – see this link:  <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext#back-bib33"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext#back-bib33</a>.  Proper masking and social distancing reduce, but do not eliminate, viral transmission.  Even if masking and social distancing guidelines are completely followed, it is conceivable that the virus could still be spreading.  If the virus is still being spread, and if the virus can live in the body for up to 37 days, then the only way to prevent a massive nationwide death toll from an uncontrolled surge in cases would be to implement a complete lock-down with no exceptions (except for emergency surgery) for at least 37 days, or up to 6 weeks.  A full lock-down would presumably prevent further spread of the virus from infected individuals, and would allow any current cases of the virus to run their course.  This lock-down, to be effective, would require executive action at all levels of government."

You can only unionize by company, so that is not an option, you can’t legally set minimums or rules across job titles, it is illegal collusion, so that is not an option. When people work under 1099, they are the company, so they should be supplying the benefits to themselves, but a self-employed person is not allowed to have a company of one, and take out payroll taxes, workman’s comp, deduct health insurance costs and pay a weekly salary, there needs to be a way to do this without the complications of being a corporation.

Facing a Congress trying its best to justify lowering the federal unemployment enhancement by refusing to accept the reality that individuals are unemployed because an employer laid them off: There are no unemployment benefits. People receive state UIB from the employer who laid them of.

Yet,Republicans (and I suspect Democrats too) are stuck on the lunacy of  $600 per week unemployment benefits being a disincentive to going back to a job that no longer exists. Or  Ohio's Rob Portman's idea of giving a bonus for ""returning"" to work vs ""deciding"" to collect unemployment benefits.

I have no doubt, they understand that millions are unemployed not of their choosing. It really is heartbreaking to witness men (mostly) who themselves are feeding at the public trough- treat $600 per week as if it grieves their souls: Are they willing to tell the soon-to-be laid-off United Airlines Captain, $600 per week is just too much to give?"

I had another Uncle who was dropped from 24 hours to 16 hours at retail job and received $900 a week in benefits. Both my uncles where working these jobs for a little extra cash and to stay busy during their retirement. The unemployment system should be able to more surgically distribute benefits.  It is a foolish waste of money to pay the full $600 a week bonus regardless to how you  Covid affected your paycheck. 

Another racket is VA disability.  I wonder how you collect disability at 31.  My last 3 bosses in the Navy retired as full captains and received  their retirement checks plus $3k per month for being 100% disabled.  One received benefits for back injury, herpes, a knee injury, plants fasciitis and sleep apnea.  By the way, he was making $260k a year as an airline pilot.  Another guy was 100% disabled but water and snow skied regularly and was a marathon runner. He said he was ashamed to tell me that he was a 100 % disables when I asked him what his disability rating was  
when he was retiring.  By the way, it included the 40% for sleep apnea that all 3 of my bosses qualified for. 
The VA’s mandatory benefits portion has grown from $22B in 2001 to $120B in 2020.  I don’t mind paying benefits to the truly wounded but paying real money for maladies we all acquire as we age or are self-induced is a racket."

Uber drivers, DoorDash delivery people, folks working less than 40 hours a week at Target (so they don't qualify for benefits) - all of these people are terribly exposed when the economy takes a dive because no matter how many hours they work, they're not ""benefits eligible"" employees and so the existing (inadequate) safety net can't catch them. We need to build systems - including a health-care system - that is accessible to all, all the time, even if you don't have a full-time, benefits-eligible job. In the meantime we need to educate people that cobbling together a living from multiple ""contractor"" or part-time jobs may offer flexibility, but the primary beneficiaries are megacorporations who don't want to pay for benefits for their employees. Those benefits are what keep people in their homes, feeding their families and alive when they get sick, their family members get sick, or they lose their jobs."

She is extremely well educated and very hard working.  She is trying to earn income through online tutoring, but these are gig jobs, too, so provide no protection. (And many tutoring companies take 2/3 or more of whatever she makes and do not compensate her for the hours she spends preparing lessons.) Every time I hear someone say we are a rich country, I want to scream. No. We have many rich people, but we are not a rich country.

The gig jobs only account for a few hours per week due to the pandemic restrictions. Like Ms. Frodeman, I don't get benefits; I have to pay for everything myself and while one of my main employers treats me as a part-time temp employee, the other considers me a contract worker. I don't qualify for the $600 additional payment, and I still have not received the $1200 stimulus payment. One of my gig employers hasn't paid me since February, even though I still do a few hours a week for her.  (I keep wondering why I keep doing it.) My cobbling of part-time jobs has been ongoing for more than a decade, ever since the last economic depression. I am a baby boomer, and have not been able to find decent work in any of the fields for which I am qualified.

Especially Republicans, who seem to think that everyone can just go out and find a job, like you would pick an apple off a tree. (Thanks, Ivanka, for your advice to just ""find something new"".) And, now these same Republican politicians have the nerve to characterize workers as lazy bums who won't work and just want to sit back and collect government benefits.

Just taking Ms. Frodeman's case, she's one worker taking up two ""jobs"". If a million workers are like her (and there are actually probably more than that), that's 2 million jobs reported, over-inflating the numbers by 100%. And of course no one reports on the average wages paid by all of these ""jobs"".

Our ""free market"" system is rigged to reward a very small minority at the expense of the vast majority. And on top of that, this uber-wealthy minority controls everything, making sure that none of their profits are reduced by having a safety net for workers. It's pure ""Law of the Jungle"", vulture capitalism. While workers in Europe are given 80-90% of their salaries, and have paid healthcare, American workers are tossed on the scrap heap without a thought. That Republicans begrudge their constituents even the paltry ""aid"" to keep them from complete destitution (and failing in many cases), is yet another indictment of their failure to uphold their sworn duty to protect and serve Americans.

Yeah, Bernie Sanders was a radical. SMH! How ""radical"" is it that a society should ensure the well being of its people? Only in ""trickle down economics"" America is that allowed."

2020-07-23 18:42:46,"I'm reading many (righteous) comments proclaiming that a liberal arts education is a cultural necessity because it teaches students how to think and it teaches them about cultural equality.

Well I have trouble with that reasoning. My experience is that (1) most liberal arts colleges these days (even/especially the ivy league college I went to decades ago)  teach you *what* to think, not *how* & (2) you shouldn't need to pay ~$100k to learn about cultural equality."
2020-07-23 18:50:57,"I have a degree, yet I still have to cobble together multiple jobs to make a living.  And thanks to this quirk of unemployment refusing to count all the income I lost, my state UI is a whopping $78/week.  Income I paid self employment taxes on, I might add, for years.  
And my degree is in computer science! Tech refuses to hire anyone over 40, even if you graduated last week & know the same things as the 25 year old next to you."

either her field does not pay much )and the logic would follow that once in it she could not afford her student loans), or her critical thinking skills are so faulty she should never be awarded a graduate degree in anything.

It would be nice to have one singular job with benefits."
2020-07-23 15:44:42,"There’s also a massive hole in the pandemic safety net that people who’ve been long-term unemployed fall through.  That $600/mo aid?  It’s not for you if you already didn’t have a job back in Jan/Feb 2020 or several months or a year before that.  The fact that you were looking for work much or all of that time counts for zero.  You may still be paying certain kinds of federal taxes and certainly state sales tax, but you get nothing. You may have been just about to get the thumbs-up for a new job but not yet had your first day.

It’s a real problem, with sometimes catastrophic outcomes."
2020-07-23 22:08:13,"State unemployment agencies could not recalculate benefits without taking months to do so.  That means little or no money for the vulnerable jobless.

California, like most states, is overwhelmed with the newly jobless.  I had to wait three anxious months for help to start.  No one should have to experience that stress on top of worrying about Covid-19.

Congress cannot torture the unemployed by changing the rules and making our survival more uncertain."
2020-07-24 00:02:01,"Should any individual become disabled while unemployed, and they're not receiving unemployment, for any consecutive quarter of the past five work years, they are automatically ineligible for disability.

If that disabled person is fortunate to meet the five year, consecutive quarters of work requirement, they then have to try to successfully become eligible to receive disability.

An almost impossible task that I've heard and read about here in the US.

These inhumane requirements have existed during our democratic presidential years.

How many of the homeless are essentially disabled/bankrupt/ill and on the street because  they do not ""qualify"" for humane treatment in the US?

The only difference at this point in history is that it is happening to far more people so the media is covering it.

Please continue to do so NYT.

Elizabeth Warren understands what insurance companies and wall street (sometimes both) have done to take from the poor (or soon to be poor) and give to the rich and mega rich.

They pay into the system just like people who work one full-time job.  Unemployment benefits needed and need to extend to them, too."
2020-07-23 23:33:22,"Two key points from this essay: (1) No one should be paid so little that working two or more jobs is necessary for survival, and (2) health care should never be tied to employment. Have you seen the bar graph that's circulating online showing how many people in the industrialized countries have lost their health care during the pandemic? It is ZERO for all but one, the United States, where the number stands at FIVE MILLION and counting. What in heaven's name are we thinking??? And by the way, the ""gig economy"" is a crock, invented by companies that want to keep their labor costs down by not paying their fair share of whatever is left of the social safety net."
2020-07-23 11:44:05,"Most are focused on the unemployment rate as a key indicator of economic health. One needs to dig a bit further to take into account the quality of jobs being created (e.g. full or part time, living wage, benefits). It is painfully obvious now that the strong job performance in the US over the last few years was significantly driven by « low quality » jobs and this has an important social cost."

Even with those credentials, she's still making barely minimum wage and slightly above. Which tells us that in addition to the fissure's caused and exposed by the pandemic, the system as a whole is not working. A college graduate making minimum wage? How's that even okay? What's the point of incurring huge debt to attend college when upon graduation, you're loading bags onto airplanes and changing septic tanks?"

2020-07-23 13:58:59,These stories are so sad. They had all their lives ahead of them. It doesn't have to be this way and it didn't have to be this way. For some people these are just numbers but for families they are broken forever because these sweet people won't grace them again. How will people ever recover from this?  I wish these families peace and I'm so sorry that you have to go through this. No one should be going through this let alone families burying multiple family members.
2020-07-23 14:25:42,"I'm very sorry for this family's tragic loss.

But come.. on..  Obesity and respiratory issues should have been *instant* disqualifiers for either sibling to do much of anything outside of their home, much less venture to Universal Studios(!), masks or not.

May they rest in peace.  May their families find solace in their memories.  And may anyone with underlying medical conditions who is considering going to a theme park (or other densely attended gathering), especially one in a known hot zone for the virus, recognize the mortal danger that going to such places currently represents.  You simply *must not* make that choice."

2020-07-23 13:12:58,"This is horrible, but really. They both had substantial underlying conditions, and not only went out, but to a theme park? Use some common sense."
2020-07-23 14:25:17,"I'm very sorry for this family, I truly am.
I have relatives who treat Covid patients and they all say that almost all of those who are younger than 50 and die from this terrible virus are obese or have diabetes.  They are not healthy.
It needs to be reported.
I realize this is politically incorrect and I want to add that this has nothing to do about race, it's white patients and black patients alike.
I really wish we had breakdowns on those who have tested positive.  Are they sick?  How old are they? Are they hospitalized?  If they are younger than 50 and are sick, do they have underlying conditions, like autoimmune diseases and/or obesity?
I realize the left gets apoplectic when these questions are asked, but as we make decisions about opening schools and businesses they need to be asked, and answered."
2020-07-23 14:03:02,"If society is judged on how we care for the weakest among us then we will be judged harshly for those who died due to their lack of access to a healthcare. The fact that you never know what’ it will cost you keeps millions from seeking care before it is too late.  

No other modern country expects their citizens to live like this but we do, so that the wealthy have the right to unlimited wealth without any personal responsibility- and donating to your pet charities does not absolve you."
2020-07-23 14:02:25,"And yet we have public officials, sucking up to Trump, fighting efforts to have people wear masks in public. Like the governor of Georgia, who is suing the Atlanta mayor for mandating mask-wearing, trying to eliminate the requirement. The governor, on television, sounds like an ignorant, backwoods hick as he makes his carnival barker pitch. Sounds like Trump, as the president fought mask-wearing for the past four months."
2020-07-23 13:45:06,"This is a tragedy for this family for sure. But this story typically focuses on their youth, as if Covid is as deadly in young people. This is categorically false, and the Times knows it, otherwise you wouldn’t wait until the last few sentences to mention that their comorbid conditions include obesity, asthma and COPD as if those are common in 20 something year olds. At least half the deaths are in nursing home patients and the median age of fatalities is 78. Enough of this hysterical reporting."
2020-07-23 13:56:31,"I am not sure what to take away from this article. Am I to tsk-tsk Florida’s leadership for their woeful conduct? Okay, sure. Am I to pooh-pooh theme parks for even opening during a pandemic-ridden summer? Roger that. Yet, like all things, personal responsibility *ahem* trumps all. I know we all want to go outside and enjoy our summer. But when you have severe health issues (asthma!, obesity!, sickle-cell!!!!), and the morbidity rate is so much higher with said issues, why, oh why would you go to the core of the crisis, no matter how much the seats are wiped down on the Terminator roller coaster. I guess I am so weary of these NYT articles (not just COVID-19) where events are happening TO people, but there is no sense of agency or responsibility placed on the actors themselves."
2020-07-23 15:00:22,"This loss is saddening, and in this war against this virus, we will sadly have many more.

But we must note that health issues appear like they run through the family, such as sickle cell anemia. And it is clear from the photos that both victims are obese.

This doesn't take any of the pain away from their deaths. But it should be a warning to the rest of us to exercise and eat healthy. And of course, stay home if we have any health conditions. If you have the financial resources, order delivery or takeout, and don't take a vacation right now."
2020-07-23 15:42:44,"Here is a family who thought they were doing everything right, being extremely cautious and careful, even thinking that Ms. Francis' symptoms were caught right away, they had a good chance she would be alright, and yet, she and her younger brother died within 11 days of each other.

Such needless deaths occurred because state officials lifted restrictions too soon without any safe game plan thought out.

I can honestly feel for that sentiment, ‘Let’s go get the kids out of the house,’” after being cooped up for so many months, but then ""all this happened.”

My heart breaks that this family experienced just how deadly this virus is.  I think Monete Hicks was spot on when she stated ""It’s not fair to bury a loved one because of other people’s ignorance, or insensitivity to this matter.”

Profound condolences to this family and to all who have lost a loved one to this virus."
2020-07-23 15:31:35,"My condolences to the family on the loss of their two beautiful children.  

For the commenters who are repeatedly raising the issue that these two siblings were obese, and therefore should have been staying home and ordering all goods delivered to their house, have you looked at the percentage of Americans who are obese?  According to the CDC, ""The prevalence of obesity was 42.4% in 2017~2018.""  Are we going to be okay with more than 40% of the American population dying because they have an underlying medical issue?  And for those who are wanting the economy to revive, how well is that going to happen if more than 40% of people are required to stay home, regardless of whether they were wearing a mask, like these two individuals did?  

When one goes to the CDC's site and looks at the factors that increase risk of serious illness from Covid-19, there's heart disease, hypertension, diabetes (types I and II), pregnancy, and smoking, among others.  This is not a blame game.  It's time for people to be safe for ALL in our society.  Wear a mask, socially distance, wash your hands, and don't go out if you feel sick."
2020-07-23 19:10:54,"I feel as if I need to write to defend these young people who have died from Covid-19: the hardest part of dealing with all of the information out there is to remain conscious of the risk. Many of us long to become unconscious and go back to the way we lived before the pandemic: eating in crowded restaurants, bar hopping, going to casinos, clubbing, amusement parks, in short, being in the throng of humanity is what makes us human,
My heart goes out to all who have lost loved ones. Stay conscious. Stay aware of risk. Wear a mask. Stay alive."
2020-07-23 22:41:02,"When all of this started, a friend of mine who lives in Puerto Rico said that we should not trust the government for data, reporting or guidance on how to act. His experience with the government's public health reporting during hurricane Maria taught him that.

In so many of these stories, people thought, ""They wouldn't open if it wasn't safe."" But it isn't safe. Just because some place is open doesn't mean it's safe to go there. To be clear, I'm not blaming this lovely family. I'm just saying we need to all recognize that the systems and institutions are not living up to what we have come to expect from them, and we have to behave accordingly."
2020-07-23 16:08:19,"My deepest sympathies to this family. May their tragedy emphasize to others that people with respiratory problems, even those as controllable as asthma, should NOT be going to crowded places, period, especially places where there are people who don't care enough about others to wear masks. And those of us who live with asthmatics (my husband has been one since childhood) need to be equally careful. I disinfect every single bottle, can, box, and bag I buy at the grocery then wash my hands with soap and hot water. Be paranoid. This virus IS out to get is all."
2020-07-23 22:47:22,"It stated in the article that the young man who died didn’t go to Universal but had shopped at Walmart which wasn’t mandating masks at the time.  At least Universal was requiring masks.  Perhaps these siblings would still be alive if Walmart had been requiring masks at the time this family shopped there.  Who knows?  
Perhaps there would be a lot less mortality for obese folks if people would don their masks.
While many Republicans seem to care less about overweight, high-risk people of color, they should want to protect their obese white Southern voter."
2020-07-24 16:42:58,"The young woman was someone who was extremely at risk due to her stated multiple medical issues.   The young man had at least two.  We do not know what the total ""underlying medical issues"" referenced by the author were.  

Their families should have consulted their medical providers before taking this trip.  Almost certainly, they would have been told that they were taking serious risks by going and by their family members returning w/o quarantining.  Since they  and their second cousin were followed medically for asthma and sickle cell, their providers absolutely knew that they were in high risk categories.  

Apparently, they did not know how vulnerable they were, and what to avoid to reduce their risk.

It is too late for them.

It is not too late for other people to ask their medical providers to help them assess their risk."
2020-07-23 11:06:23,"The answer is a vaccine or at the very least a reliable treatment. In the meantime it seems that congress wants to mitigate the pain on the American people. Only concern here is that the last package was pretty leaky with entities of dubious need lining up at the trough and shouldering aside the more needy. The next stimulus needs to be better targeted but so far it doesn’t appear that measures in this respect have been taken.

Finally 
a)tax cut ?  The good senator Mr. Cassidy may be right about altered states at the highest level. Instead, How about a significant increase on the highest marginal rate?

B) the most important things in the mean time are face masks and social distancing. Hospital costs that are high for treating this virus can be avoided if we don’t get sick with it. If you are worried about deficit spending these are the two main things under our control right now."
2020-07-23 11:23:25,"So we hear about people not going back to work because they get more from unemployment. I would like to see actual numbers on this and to what percentage they may be. So the fact that someone could work 80 hours a week at minimum wage $7.25 =$580.00 should tell you something about how pitfall that minimum is. Take away the $600.00 and spending at Amazon will drop like a rock. At this moment that is what is keeping us from a depression, along with the Fed backstopping companies. I have said it before our money problems are not because we pay too much in taxes, they are because companies pay much too little in wages. We the people should not blame government for our money problems but the power brokers who do nothing but advocate for tax decreases. We have to stop subsidizing corporations and demand that they pay a living wage. By doing this our tax obligation would decrease tremendously because the need to help poverty stricken people would decrease."
2020-07-23 10:40:11,Any money for the White House and all funding for the white noise should be contingent on the complete sharing of virus data with the public.  Alll data should all go through house and senate before going to the white house given the trump (lower case  intentional) team has ignored congressional requirements in the past.

True leadership. 
No effect on national debt."
2020-07-23 10:53:07,One can only hope that the Senate Republican revolt will lead to a Democrat Senate majority and defeat of Mitch McConnell in November.
2020-07-23 11:17:47,"In all matters related to government, the Republican party is incapable of leadership. It is the core of their party, the fundamental nature of who they are. Their guiding principal is that government is an obstacle to the market, and anything from DC is inherently bad. They do not have a plan now and they will not have a plan in the future. For anything.

And that's what makes this current situation so unique. It exposes the party for who they are and what they cannot do. They've had months (the virus was on experts radar in December 2019) to develop plans and policy for this, and nothing - absolutely nothing - has been accomplished. Even now the best they can say is re-open everything, but they have no proposal as to how to do it safely, and the best they can muster is A) tax cuts and B) ensure employers can't be held accountable if you get sick and die from coming to work.

America, ""the greatest nation on earth,"" has more cases and more deaths than any other country on the planet. This is by and far one of the single greatest failures of government in the history of the United States, and it 100% comes from the fact that Republican leadership is absent at best, and intentionally blocking life saving measures for political reasons at worst."
2020-07-23 11:18:33,"""Conservatives are apoplectic about its $1 trillion cost.""

2020-07-23 11:24:46,"No more of $600 to unemployed, it dissuades them from looking for a jobs. Give check like last time to all American that was working before the pandemic, not to retiree/disabled that recieving s.s check/homeless people/people that didn't have any job six months before pandemic started in China. Let's say December of 2019, think that's fair. No to peoples currently making more than 75k or couples making more than 110k."
2020-07-23 11:32:44,"A few more $600 per week checks for people in distress due to a pandemic will be much less costly than what the cost will be when more people get Covid-19 and everything closes down again because the Senate and Trump refused to follow the science.

Successful models of how to bend the curve existed...Germany, Italy, France, NY, NJ, CT yet this country's current hot spots failed to follow any of them.  The arrogance of Trump and others in the GOP to ignore the science and success of NY, NJ and CT is killing people.

If the Senate is upset at the cost, then perhaps there should be a tax increase on the 1% who can well afford to ante up.  They got an unrequested financial perk for no good reason other than to give Trump an opportunity to tell them how appreciative they should be.

The Senate should reflect on the bank and corporate bailouts of TARP, the eventual success of the Stimulus Plan, the constant airline bailouts, the dot.com bailout, the generous corporate depreciation opportunities of the Tax Code (not to forget today's 100% accelerated depreciation provided by the  ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018""; accelerated depreciation was to have been zeroed out by now), the more-than-generous Farm Subsidy....on and on...

We all want to get back to normal and people want to get back to their jobs.  However, we cannot starve families or get people kicked out of their rentals in order to coerce a reopening of the economy that will only make everything worse."
2020-07-23 11:31:59,"You know the old saying, 'Nothing succeeds like success'.  This is the opposite.  'Nothing fails like failure'.  All the Republicans have ever been good at is shutting down government functions and leaving them up to market forces.  We are still waiting for their healthcare plan for 10 years running.

Republicans have based their careers on defunding, and reducing the involvement of the federal government.  They basically went to Washington to get rid of Washington, all in the name of personal liberty.

Well, in a pandemic, unlimited personal liberty doesn't get you very far.  By not mandating the personal sacrifice of universal mask wearing and shutting everything down all at once and at the same time, the virus has been allowed to spread to where it is now out of control.

As many have said, we can't reboot the economy until we get rid of the virus.  If we had all cooperated by now, the virus would be essentially gone and we would not be having this conversation.

The slash and burn Republicans are now tasked with something they just do not know how to do, which is set up a big government program.  Not only can they not agree with themselves, they are getting no direction from the White House and are essentially trying to pass legislation that Trump claims he will not accept.  To top it off, none of these proposals will pass the House.

Meanwhile the clock is ticking and the virus is spreading and we are losing over a million jobs a week and the money is about to run out."
2020-07-23 10:53:23,"I never got the first stimulus check, or my tax return check (and I filed in April). Another stimulus check doesn’t seem super helpful to me right now."
2020-07-23 11:04:05,"Conservatives insist on delaying supplemental unemployment benefits, I think to sabotage the election by keeping people poor, homeless, and unable to receive ballots in the mail, but other than that, like Senator Cornyn alluded to; what if we were confronted with a war? And we are in effect! We lost 55,000 of our fellow countrymen in Vietnam. Now we have lost over 140,000 people to the virus. I suggest the Congress save the nation."
2020-07-23 11:39:48,"It's outrageous how Mitch McConnell and Congressional Republicans ignored pandemic economic impacts after  initial relief legislation.   Trump's secretive management of $511 billion, stone-walling House oversight, benefited corporations and individuals Trump favored while failing to help working Americans.   

Trump practically abandoned federal responsibility to manage COVID19 pandemic response, leaving it to the 50 states to determine government response individually.    Mixed messages from Trump were needlessly political and unscientific, contributing to deaths of 143,159 Americans to date.   The death rate has topped 1,000 per day again showing Trump's inability to create a federal pandemic response.  Economically hard hit states spent countless billions from their own coffers to combat a national emergency, and it appears Trump and his Republicans sycophants have no desire to reimburse the states for those outlays.  

The fiscal hypocrisy of Congressional Republicans is outrageous.  After years complaining about national debt under President Obama, in 2018 the Republican led Congress passed a $1.5 Trillion tax giveaway that fails to pay for itself.  Under Trump, the national debt has risen more than $5 billion while Congressional Republicans silently ignore fiscal concerns.  

Trump and Congressional Republicans fail to do what is best for America and Americans.  Instead they are doing everything and anything to benefit their party and financial benefactors."

2020-07-23 11:15:57,"Given how divided the Senate Republicans are, it's difficult to see how anything will get done.  The Senate Democrats should realize that the failure will be in Republicans' lap, so the payroll tax cut, which hurts social security, will be a non-starter. The result will be that Nov. 3 will see a Democratic landslide, but many people will suffer needlessly between now and January because of a dysfunctional Congress and a demagogue. president"
2020-07-23 11:37:12,"Amazing, this new version of Republicans. 

When it was politically expedient (and a Democrat was in the White House) they were outraged at spending money to get the economy moving forward again - every dollar added to the deficit at the time was met with apocalyptic warnings about inflation and devaluation. And if the economic recovery from the greatest financial crisis since 1929 was a bit tepid, then they could easily blame the Democratic administration. And it worked - it won them both houses of Congress and then the White House. 

But now things are a bit different, so of course the rules had to be changed. The national debt wasn't a problem when calling for a $2 trillion tax cut or a $3 trillion giveaway to keep corporate stocks from tanking as a result of this pandemic. And now we have the most delicious irony of all: facing reelection, the ""government IS the problem"" crowd is scrambling to find a way to solve major problems with government spending. And who knows? With major input from Democrats, they may even manage to come up with a few actual solutions. 

Except for those pesky True Believers, that is - the ones who are threatening to ""lay themselves down on the tracks to stop any bill they see as fiscally imprudent."" They might just toss a wrench into any chance to get Republicans reelected - er, I mean to help the American people."
2020-07-23 11:42:32,"Perhaps if the Republican Party hadn't given away a trillion or two to rich corporations and billionaires in 2017, the nation would be in a more comfortable position to help 330 million Americans.

But no, the rich needed more gold in the professional judgement of the Republican Party.

Perhaps if the Republican Party and their blind loyalists had taken the coronavirus and masks seriously, the economy would be in manageable shape.

But no, anti-science and political conspiracies ruled over reality as Trump and his GOP cronies Made Coronavirus Great Again.

Giving corporations with consistent payrolls (only) PPP money for doing nothing (particularly when those corporations are, like most small businesses, entirely comprised of owners as employees) also disincentivizes people from working.

Those businesses that are open literally can't find workers to come back -- we have seen store managers working alone as check-out, customer service and stock clerks because no one will come back. On the other hand, my son who lives frugally in expensive Los Angeles -- and whose entire film industry has been shut down entirely leaving him and his fellow 250,000 union members out of work -- can barely pay his most basic cost of living and food with the $600/week plus state unemployment. As of next week he'll be under water, raiding the small savings he has (thankfully) put aside until that's gone. It's a conundrum, yes. But a pox on our so-called leaders that they can't put aside political vitriol and figure out a phased way to keep our economy from collapsing because millions of unemployed don't have enough money to spend on anything essential.

Well, Mr. Lankford: good stewardship means that you prepare in advance for different kind of scenarios.

But the they did not send a check to people who made 100,000 last year but have now lost their jobs. The money should go to the people who need it now, and these payments should not be based on last's year income.

And calling it ""stimulus"" is clearly a lie. The person who made 100,000 last year but has now lost their job is able to stimulate the economy with that money just as well as anyone else. If Congress wanted to stimulate the economy through increased spending, they would just send the money to everyone.

Let these follows of Trump spend some serious time in the unemployment lines contemplating their humanitarian and financial culpability in the Trump Epidemic.

Instead, the republican plan is remove all safety nets for people and all responsibility for employers so that we are coerced into going back to unsafe work places with no legal recourse against employers who bring us back too early. Not to mention what will happen to an already taxed healthcare system in a country where so many have no or terrible healthcare.

People tend to spend their one-time stimulus payments quickly, while a payroll tax cut increases take home pay on a continuous basis, at least for those who still have jobs. Many poor people never got their stimulus checks at all, either because they don’t have bank accounts or didn’t know how to apply online, or because they are undocumented immigrants. I mean those undocumented immigrants working various supermarket and delivery jobs here in NYC, they have gotten nothing in the stimulus payments, zero, ziltch, nada. But they still have taxes withheld from their paychecks and they get sick with COVID-19 at much higher rates. People are saying that a payroll tax cut won’t help the unemployed but it’s not that simple. Many (probably most) folks who lost jobs are getting support now from family members and relatives who still have jobs. Lots more people are underemployed and are getting occasional or part time jobs now. Of course, the unemployment benefits need to be extended too, and that’s a higher priority.

“I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.

Every protestor has a constitutional right to freedom of expression and to assemble to exercise that right. 

If and when those who violate that oath are brought before a judge and jury the excuse “I was just following orders” won’t hold up."

They must understand that the virus will keep spreading to the point of overwhelming hospitals in locations other than the northeast.  They just can’t be that stupid.  Well, as Trump begins to embrace masks and admits “it will get worse before it gets better” it is now clear that they were that stupid.  Worse, the stupidity continues.  It will not get better if you do nothing to stop the virus.  The virus will relentlessly chew through Republican strongholds in the south and midwest.  It will also continue to decimate the economy.  If Trump continues his fumbling response, by election day, we will be living an almost unimaginable nightmare with infected people dying because there is no capacity to care for them all in a Depression level economic collapse.

Congress should determine the number of such officers being deployed and cut the budgets of these two agencies by an amount requiring the staff cuts.

Simultaneously we change some social practices for at least some people to lower the risk of the most vulnerable.
Some combination of the above is possible over time, for example as long as there is no vaccine the second two bullet points proceed. There will not however be a situation in which there is zero infections and COVID 19 disappears completely. We now have a new human pathogen that is very infectious and quite serious.

They claimed it would be invested in the economy to create more jobs, but the wealthy saved the extra money, and corporations bought back their own stock, increased dividends to shareholders and increased Executive pay.  Simply reverse this tax cut Legislation, which was not needed and was not invested as promised, and, voila!, there you have the $1 Trillion you so desperately feel you need to give aid to Americans who are about to get evicted from their homes, are about to have a drastic reduction in unemployment insurance, and many of whom are worried about how to feed their families."

2020-07-22 12:07:42,"I was recently in a United Airlines flight. Face covering on the plane was NOT enforced. Neither was the empty seat policy the airline has been touting. 
United should change its slogan from ‘Fly the Friendly Skies’ to ‘United Airlines: We Have You Covid.’"
2020-07-22 12:03:09,"After over 142,000 dead and without the COVID task force present, Trump now urges citizens to wear masks. Trump’s glimmer of rational thought will last maybe a day, before he starts blaming others, downplaying the virus and taking credit for non-results which he never achieved. Sorry, too little too late."
2020-07-22 12:17:55,"Go ahead and say what you want about the polls, Republicans. But when it comes time to counting ballots, you had better accept the results - or we're gonna have a big problem."

2020-07-22 11:50:05,"Trump mentioned masks, but in that “low energy” way that says to his base, “now I’m going to say something I don’t believe because politics.”  Trump can’t say the right thing without signaling that he’d much rather do the wrong thing. 

Nobody is going to wear a mask thanks to this clearly dishonest flip flop.  And that is a shame.  1000 dead Americans a day type shame."
2020-07-22 12:25:42,"As the failed United States  continues to break coronavirus records, our proud maskless 'leader' - after months of denial, distraction, deflection and carnage - suddenly claims that masks are terrific.

After the building has burned down, Trump decides it's okay to call the fire department.

The worst American President in history enjoys another day at the Oval Office.

November 3 2020"
2020-07-22 12:43:06,"""When millions of Americans began losing their jobs in March, the federal government stepped in with a life preserver: $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits.""

A ""life preserver"" my foot! More like bribery to increase the unemployment rate. Why should people have been paid MORE than what they would have made if they were at work?"
2020-07-22 12:48:50,"So, now that the horse has left the barn, Trump advises Americans to mask up. This after earlier mocking Biden for wearing a mask on Memorial Day and claiming wearing a mask was a political statement against him. It seems the pandemic isn’t just a few remaining embers to be put out but is now a big fire. Funny how dropping poll numbers change one’s perspective. Still, months into this tragedy, Trump offers no plan. Meanwhile, Republican senators fumble with a financial assistance plan now that they’re back on the job following an extended July 4th break. A Democratic plan was tabled last May. In fairness to the Republican senators, their expertise is limited to SC appointments and tax cuts for their wealthy donors so, delays are fully understandable. Helping ordinary Americans is something beyond their expertise - still waiting for their better than Obamacare proposal after ten years. Yet, with the November vote approaching, the Republicans and their media acolytes report the real threat to America is not the pandemic. It’s radical leftist anarchists in Democratic controlled big cities that only a law and order President can control. Apparently, these ‘anarchists’ have replaced the invading immigrant hordes that threatened the country during the mid-terms - remember them?  

I don’t know about you but, l’m getting tired of all this winning."
2020-07-22 12:45:32,"Trump’s contrition without meaningful actions amounts to crocodile tears. Where is his support for more testing and contact tracing? He insisted that the Republican Senate, believe it or not, cut it out of their current bill. Where is his support for extended unemployment benefits? Also out of the bill to be replaced by a payroll tax cut when millions are off the payroll and unemployed and facing eviction, homelessness, and poverty. And where is Dr. Anthony Fauci to tell us and him what he should be doing to revive the economy? Helping and healing Americans first by mandating the wearing of face masks, ordering a “reset” in Arizona, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and other red states where the  Covid-19 virus is out of control. But he still will do none of that in what amounts to callous,murderous hypocrisy. Trump, the self-anointed “very stable genius” has failed over and over again to realize that if you want a healthy economy you first must have a healthy workforce."
2020-07-22 12:51:38,"After six months of pretending the virus was a hoax and that masking is unnecessary or harmful our president tells us they are beginning to put together a plan.

This was entirely preventable. At every juncture when he could have done something, he chose to do nothing.  That will be Trumps legacy.  What we need to know is why.  How did he profit or protect himself personally with the decision to do nothing while Americans died?"
2020-07-22 12:43:03,"The President of the United States finally conceded coronavirus and mask reality.....on July 21 2020.....four months after the reality-based community in America conceded coronavirus and mask reality.

If you want to know what the definitions of incompetence, malpractice, denialism, ignorance, gross negligence, incuriosity, malignant narcissism and misanthropy are: look up Donald Trump in the political dictionary.

A master performance in humanitarian, intellectual, moral, economic and Presidential failure."
2020-07-22 11:48:08,"It is many, many, many, months too late for donald trump to attempt to claim any credit for action on this virus. It's months too late for many Americans, too."

We've gone to Mars....."
2020-07-22 12:55:23,"Trump still doesn’t have a plan.
He never had a plan
The only plan he had was the hope that the virus would go away so that a plan was unnecessary.

Trump doesn’t have any problem giving tax breaks or federal taxpayer dollars to businesses and tax exempt entities- so why is he against investing in testing and tracing - think of all the jobs it would create? It’s as if he wants to Weaken the US.  If so, that’s the one job he is superbly accomplishing."
2020-07-22 11:53:01,"Over 140,000 dead Americans later; Trump finally tiptoes over to the mask issue and suggests that they be worn. The media bought Trump’s latest ‘somber tone’ schtick hook, line and sinker. Not a single reporter followed up on the Maxwell question and Trump’s long, lurid history with Epstein. Not one reporter asked about Russia paying the Taliban a bounty for killing American troops. Not one reporter asked about Trump Storm Troopers wreaking havoc in Portland and the threats to unleash them in Democratically controlled cities nationwide. It’s all ‘somber tone’ and ‘big shift to wearing masks.’ If the Fourth Estate can’t save us from Trump’s tyranny and autocratic rule, then nothing will save us. It’s too late; America is done. The sickness endures, the tragedy unfolds, and the criminality goes unchecked. What a horrible state of affairs."
2020-07-22 12:00:43,"Do Trump supporters understand that while he was tweeting ""Liberate!"" he was in fact sending them out to make the pandemic worse.

Now he says wear a mask... his supporters are treated like lambs going to slaughter."
2020-07-22 13:03:10,"If these vaccines pan out, this could be the best money spent on the fight.  $2B out of trillions in total pandemic aid....it’s a risk but that could be the fastest track out of this for the lowest cost."
2020-07-22 13:05:02,"The most recent mortality analysis data from Johns Hopkins puts the US in 10th place for deaths from Covid-19.  The US is regarded as a developed nation, yet, of the 165 or so countries on the list, we rank 10th.  The continued assault on science and scientists by the right is so concerning, the American College of Physicians just drafted a statement in support of Dr. Fauci.  It is frustrating to those of us who have been scientists our entire careers to watch this pandemic unfold.  Dr. Fauci's motivation is educating people, and preventing illness and death.  Donald Trump's motivation is power, greed and reelection.  Anyone who believes Donald Trump cares about them, is sadly mistaken, and the country is paying a terrible price for this delusion."
2020-07-22 13:06:41,"For all those who have a slight understanding of this virus, vaccines are dreamland, promising protection, a promise that cannot be kept. What matters is not government support or scheduled FDA release, but the results in patients. Wait and see. This virus will surprise you. What we need is treatment, not immunity. Immunity is dreamland."

2020-07-22 13:11:07,"Our governor Jay Inslee, like many governors, delivers his addresses to the public while wearing a mask. Trump should do the same, period. Millions of Americans already speak with a mask on at work all day and in public, including those who have already had the virus and presumably are neither contagious nor at risk of contracting covid-19. If Trump’s intent is to implore everyone to wear a mask, he should do his imploring through one. We’ll hear him that much better."
2020-07-22 13:13:31,"Congratulations to Pfizer and the other vaccine developers. This kind of public / private partnership is exactly what is needed. The US Gvmt takes the financial risk for manufacturing these vaccines in parallel to the rest of the development. If they fail, it’s not Pfizer’s money. No company could risk that but in this moment it’s ideal for the country to shorten the normal time of delivery. And the price has been set, we don’t know what Pfizer makes but they are not gouging the American people and never would have. As a former employee, I know or knew their leadership and values. This is just what I had expected. Go Blue!"

2020-07-22 13:10:04,"The sad irony is that now that Trump has finally conceded that there is a pandemic and recommended that people wear masks he'll use that flip-flop to campaign for reelection on ""his record""!

And millions of the MAGA base and the rest of the GOP will buy into that revised dialogue.

Viewed in its entirety, a same society would toss Trump out of office based on ""his record"".

Yet it is highly likely to do the opposite.

Four more years of this guy will fully gut American democracy and devastate it society -- perhaps beyond repair.

And yet many seem almost intent on traveling further down this path to oblivion."
2020-07-22 13:13:21,Do I trust a vaccine from a Trump controlled FDA?  Pfizer is not on my list of ethical companies - their production of hormones from perpetually pregnant horses who spend their lives forced to stand in a tiny stall is horrifying. Perhaps I will go the Europe to get vaccinated.
2020-07-22 13:19:36,"And I suppose Trump's supporters are going to line up for this vaccine? Many of them wont accept long-proven vaccines, let alone one rushed out of the lab in record time."
2020-07-22 13:19:58,"Wait.  The Trump administration is giving ANOTHER pharma company $2 BILLION for 600 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and the first 100 million doses by December?

What about Novavax and the $1.6 BILLION awarded to them for manufacturing a vaccine?

Scientists the world over is working a vaccine and Trump honestly thinks one will be not only available by December but will be effective AND safe?

And it will be free to all Americans?

Talk about campaign chutzpah!  This guy is so desperate to win in November, he will say, promise and do ANYTHING to ensure a win.  

The shear ""warp speed"" and hurried attitude of getting something done by December is as frightening as the virus itself.   If developing an effective and safe vaccine was that ""easy"" and ""simple"", one would have been developed MONTHS ago.

Did not think I could become even more leery of this guy than I am already."
2020-07-22 13:24:09,"Who came up with the name “Operation Warp Speed?”

2020-07-22 13:21:26,Unless Dr. Fauci and the Europeans give it their blessing I would not trust this vaccine.  Anything coming out of the Trump Administration is not to be trusted.
2020-07-22 13:20:13,"Personally, I’m more than a little leery of a vaccine that was produced with a deadline meant to swing a presidential election in favor of our so called “president.”"
2020-07-22 13:24:21,This should be making headlines more often. It is disgusting that the government is not taking Covid half as seriously as it should be.

Enough manufacturing moving back to the USA? Enough meddling of Putin in our elections? Enough White House insider $profit taking by Trump and his family? Vote Blue in November.
2020-07-22 13:28:14,The President's latest actions are pure manipulation for campaigning purposes and I am very afraid it will work. He will show up a few times in a mask and his supporters will forget it was him who actively discouraged mask wearing. He will come out and claim that we have a vaccine because of his shrewd financial support for a few pharma companies. And his supporters will buy it all.
2020-07-22 13:29:04,"Man, those Pfizer lobbyists are good. Last time I checked we were all about free market capitalism and Bernie was essentially a Marxist? Oh wait, we take it one step further. You can make obscene profits, price gouge, price rig, be part of the health industrial complex that bankrupts literally thousands of Americans AND we’ll subsidize your business, prepay for an unproven product all the while guaranteeing you a hefty profit not to mention pushing your stock through the roof. Talk about having your cake and eating it too; it’s American capitalism, where we socialize all of the risk and cost but drive all of the profits to a corporation."

2020-07-22 13:30:34,"30% of Americans mistakenly believe these vaccines will prevent their immune system from handling the next outbreak of COVID and so they will not agree to be vaccinated. Russian trolls, complemented by Trump's grossly ineffective management of the crisis, is leading to increased disarray & discord inside the US.  While we are unable to stop the Russians and unable to force common sense into Trump, the majority of Americans will be vaccinated. Therefore, over time, those who reject will have a higher death rate and the problem with ignorance solves itself.

I'm saddened it's come down to this, but logic and reason seems beyond 30% of America. They reject science and believe a man whose failed repeatedly. Therefore, Darwin's theory on Survival of the Fittest will prove itself one more time."
2020-07-22 13:31:17,Already I distrust this vaccine for two reasons:  Trump is probably a yuuuge beneficiary of awarding this contract to Pfizer.  And the government is going to administer the distribution of the vaccine.  So does that mean that the no-go zones like certain Chicago neighborhoods don't get the vaccine?  Probably.  This news should be welcome but leaves a nasty taste in one's mouth.
2020-07-22 13:33:12,So how are the ‘base’ responding? Terribly quiet on this.
2020-07-22 13:45:11,"I'm as pro-vax as they come but Trump has given nearly $4 billion to companies to develop a vaccine just in time for the November election makes me suspicious.  Immunologists/epidemiologists say that the minimum amount to develop a SAFE vaccine is 18 months.

2020-07-22 13:38:15,"It boggles my mind every time I hear today about the scientists recommendations five months ago about not wearing a mask differ from today and being recommended to wear masks for public safety. Science evolves, knowledge is gained. But god forbid learning masks help or PPE more available now,
Let’s stay stuck in this pandemic because we can’t wrap our minds around the evolving corona pandemic."
2020-07-22 13:43:57,A vaccine by December appears to me to be nothing more than another Trump political scheme aimed at winning the election. If anyone believes that their will be a vaccine by the end of the year for  “FREE” just needs to look at well this country has handled COVID-19 in the last four months.
2020-07-22 13:39:50,"$600, folks. That’s what the GOP slighting over because many if not most of them think that 600 bucks is going to make you work-shy, i.e. unready or unwilling to work at whatever job they tell you for whatever pittance they choose to pay you. It’s an old fashioned idea, one of many they entertain. I wonder just how far they think 600 bucks goes? That’s like one round of drinks with their lobbyist pals at some DC steak house. 

I wonder how much those guys playing soldier in Portland get paid an hour, and Chad Wolf."
2020-07-22 13:43:16,"For a guy who did not believe in face coverings, who called the country's leading infectious diseases expert an ""alarmist"", who stated this virus would ""simply disappear"" in warmer weather, we are now supposed to believe much less TRUST him when gives ANOTHER pharmaceutical company nearly $2 billion to develop a vaccine and distribute it by December?

Holy Mackerel with a face mask - how in the world can we trust or believe ANYTHING from someone who is so dang desperate to win in November, he will fast-track and have the FDA give an emergency approval to a vaccine that no one else in the world has been able to develop?

Come on already, enough already.

Frankly, I think I'd rather take my chances with the virus than with this ""warp speed"" vaccine.

The brilliant minds at Oxford have been working on a vaccine for MONTHS and MONTHS.  According to the scientists working on this,  none of the trials has been able to measure results over more than a few weeks, raising questions about the longer term effects of the vaccines.

2020-07-22 13:49:54,"On the relief plan issue:
The NYT has been focusing on the $600 extra unemployment benefit, but ominously silent on what else is in the bill.  Perhaps what is being kept out of view is that the Republicans and Nancy and Chuck are in lockstep regarding the majority of the bill going once again to big business.  I can't wait the the ""we had to act so fast we didn't have time to read it"" excuse again.

On the vaccine issue:
""Before it could be distributed, it would first need at least emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration.""

Thus far his tract record has been strongly urging the promotion of hydroxychloroquine and then there was his suggestion of injecting disinfectant as a treatment to fight this virus.   Oh and of course, he has been flatly against wearing any kind of face protection and held a campaign rally in Tulsa, so much for social distancing.  The list could go on for days . . ."
2020-07-22 14:04:17,"I certainly hope that this vaccine is a success, but I’ll believe it when I see it. Nothing should be taken for granted in the interim, and the timing for the Trump administration could not be more suspicious."

2020-07-22 13:56:38,The fact that United Airlines has to make its own mask policy is ridiculous. Do you mean people are still wandering around airports in this country without masks? I am definitely living in a NY bubble. And happy about it.

It’s true (see many reader comments) that $600 will not go far in coastal blue state metro areas, but in southern, western, or midwestern ‘heartlands’ (ie Trump’s territory) its a non-trivial amount.  Therefore don’t discount the good - and associated political harm - it is doing.
The problem is the use of a dollar amount to define the benefit.  The same problem exists with the idea of a national minimum wage.  Why on earth would it be the same in NYC as in Mobile?
Why not define those benefits by the percentage of wages previously earned (and on which taxes were paid) for example?  And adjust minimum wage by regional cost of living indices?

Trump won’t even wear a mask.  Make him first in line to be vaccinated by the winner of the race for the new COVID vaccine.  

The government is doing nothing more than putting our tax payer money on the line to gamble.  Like a horse race.  Humans will  be  used as guinea pigs to see who is the winner and how long it lasts, and with what ramifications or risks.  As a seasoned registered nurse this makes me very skeptical.

But the promised money infusion will make their stocks go up, in turn boosting the remuneration of their executives and board members, who will likely also earn a juicy bonus for their slick efforts.  All, without any certainty they will be able to deliver anything of value other than a windfall for giving it that good old college try.

2020-07-22 14:25:11,"Whether any of these vaccine candidates of Pfizer becomes deployable vaccine that will actually get administered in the entire population of the US soon enough or not, it is indeed good to know that the US government (WH and Congress) is doing all it can to develop a vaccine against Coronavirus 2 COVID-19. Without a vaccine the total panic madness of lock downs, quarantines and devastation of businesses caused by orders from governors that has caused unemployment of millions will just continue on and on.  

In the 2nd most populated country in the world, India the lock down and quarantines have wrecked livelihood to such an extreme extent that the migrant workers are more likely to die of starvation than of Coronavirus COVID-19. The REMEDY IS WORSE THAN THE DISEASE.

More people are dying in India of all other leading causes of death due to medical care neglect because the care for COVID-19 patients has become a highly lucrative business for doctors and hospitals. Yesterday I received report, doctors are receiving big bribes to discharge patients who recovered from COVID-19 or issue death certificates to families that lost a loved one to COVID-19. 

August 15, 2020 will be India's 73rd independence day. The words of the first PM of India, Nehru ring hollow and so does the sacrifice of the brave men and women who laid down their lives in a nonviolent struggle for independence. India should free its masses from the lock down and restrict quarantines for no more than 3 days."

The perfect quid pro quo is to pump billions into a ""speedy"" vaccine so all those bucks can be poured in return into Donald Trump's campaign for reelection.  By November, all this man's missteps, spins, lies, distractions, diversions, and utter failure in saving lives and livelihoods will suddenly disappear from the minds of his most avid supporters.  He has found the cure in the form of a rushed vaccine approved by an FDA under his control and watchful eyes.  God help us all."

I thought Trump had a bit of the same ""hostage"" look that he had back in mid March when the markets crashed and he felt forced to pretend that he took the pandemic seriously.  I suspect that a lot Trump's cult followers will just assume that Trump was speaking out of political necessity rather than conviction, which is the way it looked to me, and they will have no interest in being sensible about masks or anything else.   They have internalized the idea that their Dear Leader wants them to be indifferent about covid and to snicker at the silly libs who don't understand that the disease is ""just a flu"".  A toxic mix of stupidity and pure nihilism has infected a substantial enough minority of Americans to badly cripple any possibility of effective societal measures to reduce the impact of pandemic.   Because of that the medical aspects of the pandemic will be far worse than need be and the corollary economic consequences will be terrible."

Plus the anti-vaxers are going to have a field day because, for once, they will have a valid point that the vaccine has not been adequately tested. Instead of taking the time to rigorously test new vaccines while suppressing viral transmission through effective public health measures, Americans apparently prefer a quick fix which may confer only limited or temporary immunity."

And the CEOs? They are really grateful for our American tax dollars, especially since they will still own the most valuable thing, with the research already paid for by the American taxpayers, the patent!

Wait. Now that I think of it, I think the taxpayer may have just been thrown under the bus!

And a sincere thanks for the support of mask wearing, which costs the federal government nothing. It may be the most cost effective thing you’ve done during this pandemic. 

Sincerely,

Here’s hoping for the best.

But historically only a third of promising vaccines entering phase 3 trials successfully reach the market. And with well over a hundred vaccines in development, it’s also unlikely the first ones across the line will be the safest or the best.

However, a vaccine doesn’t have to be perfect to be useful during a deadly pandemic. Even 50% efficacy could be huge as long as it’s also safe. I wouldn’t order hundreds of millions of dose out of the gate, but I’d start with the most vulnerable folks plus essential workers. People could be revaccinated when a better one comes along, but only if their titers were too low.

Anyway, I’m glad Republicans feel chastened after denigrating the Obama administration for backing Solyndra among a portfolio of companies receiving stimulus money during the Great Recession.

Covid-19 may be just the warmup act for what is to follow. Climate change is unchartered territory. If a person doesn’t understand the science of virology enough to know the difference between what is and is not the way to protect themselves, they are not likely to have the motivation and discipline to do what must be done. 

Maybe there will be one geographic country where people wear face masks, practise social distancing and wash their hands appropriately, a country where people have a prospect of living and working within specific limitations till people, working together, find a way to safely live in the world that is coming.

The other country will be a more “fun” place with lots of socializing the way it used to be, going to the pub, having a few drinks, up on the packed dance floor.

Meanwhile, the rest of us blokes will be left to pay $$ for our vaccinations (if even available) or see our insurance premiums rise as those companies are charged.

And who is behind this devil-may-care attitude of who-cares-about-the-little people, i.e., us?

Meanwhile, millions continue to be unemployed and could face utter calamity if their benefits are not extended.

The only reason Republicans suddenly care about their unemployed constituents is because it is an election year for many of them.  They figure a few bucks and crumbs tossed to the masses will save them on November 3rd.

I’m not saying things are great in California, but it should amaze people more that they’ve held it together for as long as they have given the density of areas like LA. 

Seriously, 10 million people in one county! 

I imagine social distancing is a lot easier in most of the US than it is there. We should all be cheering for California for making it this far and encouraging its residents to keep up the hard work they have been at since mid-March when the first stay-at-home orders were put in place.

We are making great progress with this approach as the mortality rate has decreased significantly.  The fact that many people are still contracting the virus, and many more will, is somewhat related to our ability to wash our hands, socially distance, and wear a mask; not attributable to any shut-down that might have or might not have been dictated or even supported by a governor, mayor, or even a president; but is very much attributable to the nature of this virus.

2020-07-22 22:30:40,"NYT - your reporting on the rise in cases relative to the rise in testing is misleading.

1) in order to confirm a case of CV19, there must be a test.

2) the number of confirmed cases that result based on the testing depends on the prevalence of infections in the sampled population.

If the entire sample population is infected, increased testing will result in a one-for-one rise in confirmed cases. If no one is infected in the sample population, no new cases will be revealed. It is impossible for confirmed cases to exceed the number of tests.

I think what the article is trying to say is that the prevalence rate (e.g. proportion of infected individuals in the population) seems to be growing, which would indicate an increase in infections within the communities sampled.

The article’s tone is tying to debunk the theory that the case rise is only attributable to increased testing, and not a new an intense second wave. But had the entire population been already infected, the observed case rise would indeed be a uniform function of increased testing.

Indeed, we are witnessing a second wave. But our statistics are reflecting both increased testing and a growing prevalence rate.

This was in the press about two weeks ago; Canada and UK were joiners. The US was said to be conspicuously absent although Bill Gates was mentioned as a private contributor. I could not find updates on this issue today on the web.

If the EU collaboration goes through, we need to know how that affects the reported purchase of potential vaccines from Pfizer (a German company) by Trump, aka the US government.

As to how Trump would distribute any vaccines under his control, let's recall Hogan's (Governor of Maryland) account of ordering PPE from S. Korea. Hogan's wife is of Korean descent and was instrumental in getting PPE from S. Korea this Spring, when states were bidding against each other for PPE and the Federal government was whisking supplies as they were flown in before states could claim them. Consequently, Gov Hogan said he met the shipment as they landed and carried off the supplies just before the federal government appeared. 

Knowing Trump as we do, I wonder how equitably Trump would distribute vaccines and would he understand that the most vulnerable and the essential workers must have priority.

When New York was raging out of control back in March & April as the initial Coronavirus hot spot, and leading the nation until today in total positive tested cases; Trump refused to enact, (as still through today); ""The Defense Production Act.""
 
Neither was he willing to have his Federal Government help NY Governor Andrew Cuomo acquire the medical supplies of sudden shortage needed in NY City overcrowded hospitals, in which their heroic employees likely felt it was Times Square filled with millions on New Years Eve up through 2019.

His reason besides ""I refuse to accept any responsibility"":
""New York didn't treat me fairly when I was there.""

And a lot of differences between the states concerning when the virus really took hold, the ability to distance etc. There's no way to compare central New York to rural Texas or shielded rentier ghettos in Florida.

But still there are facts:

The traditional defense with isolation and distancing works. Basic sanitary precautions ( avoiding crowds, washing hands, wearing masks, avoid touching things in public spaces, avoid touching your face, etc.) works. Keeping track of the spread with fast testing and tracing works. 

The traditional methods only works if the vast majority agree, and can afford to agree. It is certainly a problem in the US, where you seem to enjoy blaming each other instead of cooperating, and your collective funds are not exactly spent fairly or even with a rational aim. 

But the traditional way is how many nations beat the virus, at least for a while.

We can all fantasize and burn billions on imagined miracle cures, unsure herd immunity or vaccines, but until they are proven and real the traditional methods are all we have.

In the US you blew your first lock-down many places, and Dr. Fauci is right. You need to take a hard look at yourself, face the challenge and unite your efforts. One state cannot succeed alone, the US can't succeed without a global effort.

Here is why most Democrats are full of it.  95% of them haven’t gotten sick. 2/3 of them don’t even know anyone who has gotten sick. Most of them put lots of faith in science even thought most scientists admit that all the emergency research that has been done does not conform to best practices, so that a lot of accepted wisdom, including masks, will remain iffy until better experiments are done. And one more thing, these Democrats often distort the truth about Trump. For example, when he called for less testing context reveals that he was actually complaining about inaccurate tests. 

I find my fellow Democrats to be very emotional about the virus and not nearly as knowledgeable as they think. And what they most want out of this thing is to embarrass Trump.  If you need to get sick to further that goal, thank you for taking one for the team."

The inaction during the current epidemic relates to the Freudian concept of the 'death drive'. This drive is so obvious that people cannot observe this elephant anymore.

The drive might have to do with tax returns, Ponzi schemes, or with Ghislain Maxwell, who I just yesterday saw being wished, not once, but twice, 'all the best'. This wishing the best is overt interference with a witness.

Why would we drop from 18,000-20,000 + tests processed per day down to 15,000, 10,000 and then 8,000 when we have a huge backlog?

To me, this makes no sense.  What is up?

It seems like we may have stabilized some, since it seems like new hospitalizations may be down, but deaths are way up and may be the reason for more available ICU beds, but we really have no clear picture here.  There are also shorter lines at testing sites - but what about the backlog?

My guess is that the mask mandates imposed by mayors and the closing of bars has helped.

But why can't we get a real picture of things?"
2020-07-23 09:53:14,"The analysis of ""expected"" positive test results is a little bizarre, because people aren't being tested randomly. Those receiving tests include people who decide they want a test; may or may not have symptoms or have been exposed; live in hot spots or mildly affected areas; are willing to wait in long lines; have been requested or required to be tested; can tolerate long delays for results. All of these affect the number of expected positive tests, and they don't stay constant or vary consistently. It's comforting to have some numbers, but like so much else about our response to the virus, we really don't have a clear statistical picture."
2020-07-23 10:38:30,"The percentage testing positive on a given day is not necessarily a good estimate of the percentage of the population with the virus.  In fact it would likely be an overstatement.

Assume 10% of the population has the virus and 1% of those show up for that day’s test, assume 90% does not have the virus and 0.5% of those show up for that day’s test.  Then the percent positive for the day’s test will be:

.01•.1 / (.01•.1 + .005•.9) = 
.001 / (.001 + .0045) =
.001 / .0055 =
18% roughly,

which overstates the 10% positivity for the  population in the example.

Different values for the percentages that show up for the test would yield different results.  But it seems quite likely that the percentage that show up for the test that do not have the virus would typically be smaller than the percentage that show up that do have the virus.  In this case the positivity percent for the test would overstate the positivity percent for the population."

The next question will be how to get it into every corner of our country - and the world, where access is extremely important.  This is a world catastrophe.

The final question will be whether Americans will agree to get the vaccine, so that we can truly put this behind us.  

I look forward to the day when I can attend a performing arts or sports event, when teachers and students and workers can again engage for the greater good.  And when we can reflect on so much that this pandemic is teaching us - about what is important and how we can forge a progressive future for the next generations - in public health, climate, racial equity, food, the importance of democratic practice - and so much more."

It will be Trumps failure to pretend there is no problem when there is one and he will be stuck. Now millions will not believe him.
2020-07-22 20:55:24,"Two months of testing seems inadequate to me. The vaccine may work sufficiently well to ward off infection for a few months, but does the immunity last? Wouldn't we need to test antibody titres in patients for several more months to make sure that it's effective over a longer period. I am very hopeful that this vaccine works, but I am concerned that anti-vaxers will be keeping a sharp eye our for any story of significant side-effects, or of vaccinated people contracting the virus.

2020-07-22 21:43:36,"Well, the fact that they get close to $2,000,000,000 when delivered, combined with the fact that ""regulatory"" is blasphemy in the Trump administration, I don't have much confidence in the safety of a vaccine produced under these conditions.

This is an election ploy, not anything designed to help Americans.  Somebody wants to say there's a vaccine coming.

Nobody cares that it's safe.  Big Pharma wants their money at all costs, Trump wants the election at all costs.  Human lives, the lives of American citizens,  mean nothing to either entity. 

I'll pass on the vaccine."
2020-07-22 23:43:09,"I am not sure that this will work. Until they work satisfactorily, there is no way to know who will develop the vaccine, first. Awarding contracts to minimize delays in delivery is an aspiration but it must involve creating production facilities that may never be used. The government is incurring costs that may turn into difficult to pay debts."
2020-07-23 00:15:46,"Given that the Coronavirus is costing us upwards of $100B per month in lost economic activity and government stimulus payments, as well as unmeasured damage to our mental and physical health, manufacturing vaccines that may not be approved makes mathematical sense.  If we manufacture all of the promising vaccines at scale even though several of them will not be approved the total costs incurred will pale in comparison to the cost we pay each month for the status quo."

And the cash only supplies doses for a third of the population.
Instead of protecting “proprietary” research and indicting Chinese students for seeking information to save lives there, the process for making s working vaccine should be made public, allowing all the vaccine labs not making other necessary products - like ramping up for the next flu season - to produce 300 million doses for the US alone, and letting other nations use their facilities to supply their regions, with a collective supply for hard-hit areas lacking them.
Oh, but that’s “socialism” - the US only devotes socialist economics to sending troops and federal cops to big cities run by Democrats to scare us into believing they are needed to stop “violent anarchists” at peaceful protests against Trump’s racist and more dictatorial daily regime.
Amazing - feds come in, firing tear gas at peaceful protestors just before Trump Re-election campaign spends $20 million on law and order ads - that’s Donald “I can shoot someone on 5th Avenue in broad daylight and not be indicted” Trump."
2020-07-23 02:29:51,"One of the things I'm not understanding about this arrangement: what happens if Pfizer's vaccine doesn't work, isn't safe, or isn't out by the end of the year? Apparently, they don't get the $2 billion dollars - or so we are led to believe. 

But the company is going to have ramped up production of the vaccine anyway? It's hard to imagine a company putting that much into creating a product that may be a total loss, e.g. if their vaccine doesn't work and another company beats them to it. 

It would be great to have the government ensure that production is rapid and the vaccine is free. But something doesn't smell right. Is there something in the works to guarantee Pfizer's vaccine being approved, ready or not? That would be typical of how Trump does things - so forgive me for not trusting the process. If he really is doing something right, I'm glad to acknowledge it. Once we know that it IS right."
2020-07-23 10:40:37,"I wonder if there is a clause, hidden in the details of the deal,  that states Pfizer will not be held accountable, and will have no financial liability, for any deaths caused as a result of receiving the vaccine (i.e., people receiving the vaccine cannot sue Pfizer if they have adverse reactions to the virus)."
2020-07-23 13:56:05,"I understand the urgent need in finding a vaccine but with the hyper-political desperation involved with this administration...it makes for a frightening outcome. If all pharmaceutical companies working on vaccines agree to taking full responsibility for negative serious/dangerous reactions (not issues like a temporary rash etc.) then I'd feel a bit better about it. If only we had paid attention and had a cohesive federal policy months ago, this almost manic rush for a vaccine wouldn't be as severe and desperate."
2020-07-23 14:04:04,"I think that all articles on a coronavirus vaccine need to note (1) federal law generally makes vaccine manufacturers immune from liability for injury or death caused by the vaccine, see 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-22(b)(1); Bruesewitz v. Wyeth llC, 562 US 223 (2011); (2) because science has yet to establish that infection with COVID 19 gives one immunity, especially since the disease has only been around for about 7 months, the efficacy of any vaccine is questionable; and (3) emergency authorization for a vaccine does not mean it's safe, as that would require longer term safety testing."
2020-07-23 03:36:00,"A billion here, a few billion there, to big pharma for nothing yet developed, nor proven safe or effective.  Plus over a billion dollars handed over to a company that has never even brought a vaccine to market.  Such largesse!

I can't wait to see him try and sell the country this one. 

The failures of this administration are astounding. Whether the vaccine works or not - the die is set. This will be just one more expensive disaster."
2020-07-23 15:26:35,"I hope the $1.95 Billion is given to Pfizer in installments or 2 use the French word tranches based on milestones met. What if there are problems along the way? Big pharma does not normally like to get involved in the vaccine business and so I can understand incentives by shoveling billions but if the vaccine surfaces when the pandemic tapers out then it is a waste of tax payer dollars. 

During the 2009 swine flu pandemic also there was a vaccine that became available well after the peak period when the vaccine became abundantly available. Millions including myself acquired immunity against the flu virus,  the old fashioned ancient way by enduring the infection for a week because the vaccine was not timely. For the Coronavirus 2, now would be a good time to have the 600 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Come end of the year it will make little difference. Time is of the essence. The virus multiplies fast, each cell in the respiratory tract of an infected person can spit out as many as a 1000 progeny virus particles. We have heard all kinds of statistics, guess how many Coronaviruses 2 on our planet?  Zillions, Bazillions, Gazillions?
Until every Corona is neutralized the chance of spread will persist. Only a timely vaccine can achieve that. The way Corona is spreading and the panic that follows along with the business shutdowns we are going to see the worst economic disaster since the great depression. The $10 billion spent at attempts at a timely vaccine is worthwhile."

More reason for skepticism is Novavax, that has never brought a product to market in 33 years, being handed $1.6 billion under “Warp Speed” to develop a coronavirus vaccine.

No one had ever treated my agent as she did, nor made the demands she made on the work I did. In 30 years I had never had such a client be so... rude, egotistical, and uncaring.

An artist is fawned over in the media and builds a reputation and following based on what appears to be a highly successful and profitable product, but there’s actually a mountain of family money that’s just out of sight or considered to be somehow irrelevant to discuss. Young and emerging artists—especially those who do not have access to such wealth—need to be informed about this reality. Influencers and leaders with family wealth are often the most vocal proponents of empty slogans (eg follow your dreams!) and they help convince struggling practitioners and the general public that anything is possible if you just work hard enough. It’s not true. It’s a mirage.

Luxury retailers like DVF have always had a limited market and appeal yet they act as if they are Starbucks and want to open up shop on every corner and surely banks would never give a small business owner loans to do such things.  Because of their high profile status these retailers are given advantages beyond what is fiscally rational.  Who pays the price?  Always the same people, employees, small vendors, independent contractors, and suppliers to whom the loss is incalculable and from which they might never recover unlike DVF who can sail off on a yacht into the sunset.

It’s evidence of a cultural refocus where designer brands may end up in general to have less significance for the general population than has been customary.

Let's say that the Dillers/von Furstenbergs  are worth  $200 million, with $50 million of it liquid. After expanding the DVF retail, they start losing money.  As DVF tries to regroup, COVID hits, compounding losses.  By June 2020, DVF is losing $10 million a month,

Should the family spend the $50 million to pay creditors, rents, salaries, etc. over the next few months. No, it should not, because not only will this fail to save the company, but the family will rapidly burn through their cash.

Owners of businesses, no matter their wealth, have to run their companies based on a sound business model. The only thing that prolonged DVF is Mr. Diller's funding of a business that should have reorganized earlier. 

I do think the DVF folks should pay their creditors through a certain period. Pathetic that the florist has not been paid.  And I think they should provide severance packages to everyone who's been laid off.

But the family is not obligated to do more than that. People who are not wealthy have businesses that go bankrupt, with unsecured creditors and employees.  This is the American system, and to create different standards based on the wealth of company owners is not a sound legal proposition."

2020-07-22 15:06:01,"So Ms. Von Furstenberg owes $20,000 to the florist and only declares that she may pay such debt when she remembers that she needs to plug her next book. These people are indeed pathetic."

2020-07-22 14:41:36,"The rich get richer.  Can she ""afford"" to pay her staff?  She is rich as Croesus. Honor your commitments, Diane."
2020-07-22 14:24:20,"It appears that Diane (I will not grace my comment with her full name) built her company and the launch of her granddaughter’s brand using the goodwill and money of suppliers, vendors and employees. Apparently had no other skin in the game other than her reputation and “name”. 

Despite having personal wealth and being married to great wealth she felt no obligation to treat employees and “small people” with anything other than a cursory dismissal. It appears the servants and serfs were only kept long enough to prop up the nobility. 

Sadly the majority of her friends and fashion colleagues are likely aghast and feel “sad” for poor poor Diane. I’m sure they’re looking into their cocktails and wondering how they can help her when she starts to rise again! Perhaps there’s a humanitarian award she can win or a foundation she can start to rehabilitate her reputation. Nothing helps rehabilitation like a little good PR. 

What you should have done Diane is transferred enough of your personal wealth to pay all your suppliers and severance for your employees. Signed over creative rights of your legacy to your granddaughter so she could build something based on her skills and called it a day. Be the designer who left with their head held high and reputation intact. 

Sad you let your hubris dictate your actions. But then again … your actions kinda sum up America right now."
2020-07-22 14:34:34,"Barry must love her? It seems his wealth was underpinning her fashion empire. How deep are his pockets and his love? Clearly not deep enough to finance a graceful exit to her “ego fueled empire”. How long before the divorce lawyers are called in if not already.   Her comment about the “smaller” people is truly disgraceful. The“smaller people”have proven their worth during this crisis meanwhile DVF was a one trick pony, the wrap dress. Thank you to the poster for contributing their personal interaction with DVF. The French should ask for the medal to be returned."
2020-07-22 14:57:47,"The “little people” comment reminded me of when Leona Helmsley (another entitled piece of work), infamously stated “Only the little people pay taxes”.

2020-07-22 14:36:56,Why even write about her at all?  Sounds to me like an advertisement to drum up business she has no business being in.  Clearly her management skills were left at the door.  It's a shame that nowhere in this article did she even hint at trying to pay her struggling employees or vendors.  I will never buy anything with the DVF logo on it.
2020-07-22 15:09:46,"Gosh I love her reference to “the smaller people”

To give her the benefit of the doubt I assume she means small business owners

She said she will pay them - when?  They are struggling now.  Her mis-management of her company is not their problem, except that it is.

And to let employees go with no safety net at all?

But hey! Let ‘em eat cake!"
2020-07-22 15:16:31,"Ordinarily I value Ms. Friedman’s expertise and coverage of the fashion industry, but I find the entire tone of this article insulting to the intelligence of people who have seen this coming for the Diane Von Furstenberg brand well before Covid.  The context and content seem to speak to those who have no clue how the fashion industry actually works, or who have little memory of how and when Ms. DVF’s fairy tale began, i.e., us Boomers who ogled her on the cover of newsmagazines as the “It Girl” of the 1970s.  When she married Diller, a lot of wags speculated then that her company was in trouble, given Diller’s wealth.  Also, every article at that time reverently deferred to DVF that, since her company was private, “sales figures are not readily available” - further promulgating her myth. The reality is that this brand, while led by an accomplished woman that deserves to be called a legend, is well past its prime.  Cheap knockoffs of DVF’s signature wrap dress have been available by the millions over the past fifty years.  Plus the style is not conducive to many women (young or not) who rebel against body-shaming decrees required to maintain a figure for the DVF wrap.  Lastly, perhaps the brand should heed the advice that if we are old enough to remember wearing a particular style decades ago, then perhaps we are too old to wear it now.  The DVF brand is that kind of anachronism."
2020-07-22 15:18:38,"Why not just pay those you owe?  That is a great business model.

Now I know why sometimes my life has felt tied down and mundane. And here I thought that reading Betty Freidan and de Beauvoir as a young teenager had shown me the path from a dreary 50's Yonkers upbringing to a life I chose for myself. 

Alas, I never shopped DVF. This pandemic has me down. And now it's too late, gasp."
2020-07-22 16:02:53,"Thank you, NYT, for running this informative and illuminating article. DVF seems like an entitled, clueless person who deserves every bit of the reality check the comments section is providing. 

I would like to request many more articles like this that focus on public figures who are hiding behind corporate shields to avoid responsibility. There is no question she could instantly pay all of her debts. She simply doesn’t choose to do so.

Shaming those who have acted in brazen self interest is a valid way of expressing disapproval. Had DVF not been so convinced of her self-perceived victim/legend status she would have paid every last bill the moment the call from the NYT came in saying that a story was in the works."
2020-07-22 16:09:48,"DVF, began furloughing her employees in March, which entitled them to the extra $600.00 per week once the 'Care Act' was passed. DVF, could not have picked a better time to let people go. I'm sure many of her employees, made more on unemployment than they did from their actual salary; of course, DVF can't come out and say that. Most important, they were allowed to stay home and isolate and stay safe...   rather than be forced to go to work and risk their lives. I believe DVF, needs to be given the credit for picking the perfect time to downsize...  for everyone's sake."

Now that we know clothing is made for pennies on the dollar, designers still want to charge outrageous pricing for their designs.  (That's why they're so rich).  Unfortunately (or fortunately), the curtain has been pulled back on the luxury brand industry as a whole.

Every one of these young socialites' sole ambition is to be a model. Somehow being used by labels like Dolce & Gabanna in their runway shows was something to covet instead of being recognized for the banality it really conveyed. TVF took a spot at Georgetown and then dropped it for independent study at NYU for what? To bring more cheap flower dresses into the world. They weren't exactly the solution to turning an ailing business around. Her billionaire mother makes plastic table accessories, her aunt makes children's clothes, her cousin is a ""model"".  With all that wealth, power, and access you would think they could dream bigger and achieve more than just another clothing/cosmetic/accessories line. DVF is held up as a business icon, yet all she really was was a socialite who married two wealthy bisexual men that funded her business. I'm more impressed with her work for the Highline and the Statue of Liberty - they had an impact. Maybe the pandemic will bring a halt to the socialite vanity projects and bring them back to helping those less fortunate in being born lucky."

Oh, and her sense of humor and brutal honesty (a breath of fresh air in our fake culture)...

By that late date, internet retail was extremely well developed and there were many existing successful retail templates from which to choose. Even halving the expansion - half brick and mortar and half internet would have softened the blow.

It a commonplace that the visionary, the entrepreneur, does not understand the business end and runs to the end of their expertise. But surely someone in that constellation of visionaries and big money had some sense. 

I believe there's still a market out there for snappy, easy to wear dresses and tunics and such. I really hope they can pull off a successful transition. I feel she has the survivor gene."

The young since the 1980's are growing up in a society where surface is everything.   I don't have much pity for families like the Furstenbergs, although I think in today's United States I am probably supposed to.

On what planet does she live that allows her to ignore ""the smaller people,"" as she calls them, while talking about being ""as fair as we possibly can"" in paying them what they are owed? She isn't bankrupt. Her husband is a BILLIONAIRE. Yet she put her employees on furlough without a dime in a country that, as usual, gave billions of dollars to rich corporations and individuals who didn't need it, while ignoring 90% of small businesses owned by women and people of colour. She could have ""borrowed"" money from her husband to take care of the people who have worked so hard for her. What is a few million to a billionaire? It is such a tiny percentage he wouldn't even notice it (e.g. $2 million is .05% of $4 billion). Clearly, when you're rich, being ""as fair as we possibly can"" means doing the same thing you did to get so rich: ripping off honest, hard-working Americans."

If Diller and DVF really loved NYC and it's people it would set benches on green grass facing the water under trees. Young people who work in floral and dress shops and don't make a lot of money love free spaces to just sit and see a pretty view. They bring sandwiches, soda, a date, they hug and kiss. Diller could put a sign with his name on it. People would love him and DVF every time they sat there for a hour and chatted. Diller fought tooth and nail against enviormental studies stating how much the natural river world would be displaced for aged rockers to perform and pollute the air with loud sounds selling tickets at astronomical prices in an ugly unnatural structure. Diller live in California. DVF and family live all around the world not just NYC.

Americans, including NYT readers, have proven with their buying habits that they will always choose the lower priced item provided quality and delivery are reasonably equal. 

Americans, unlike citizens of other countries, have very little concern for who makes their product.   We punished companies that paid the wages and benefits in favor of those that can import from China and other low cost countries. We favored companies that don’t pay the social security, Medicare or state and local taxes.

2020-07-22 14:10:40,"Always puzzled when I read articles about the state of manufacturing that fail to discuss American education. Why is China such a growth market? Because China does not educate everyone equally like we do. They have a constant class of educated consumers and a constant class of low-wage manufacturing workers. A kid at 7 knows exactly what job he will be doing 10-20 years down the road. 

“Still, more companies leaving China does not necessarily represent a win for American workers. Like La-Z-Boy, many companies that are moving some facilities out of China — including Samsung, Hasbro, Apple, Nintendo and GoPro — are relocating to countries where wages are even lower... If you want to hedge your risks, you need to stay global.”

We cannot compete with China, Taiwan etc. because America gives people the choice to be and do whatever they want to be and do. And even though the minimum wage in America is too low, we still pay more than the sweat shops. 

That said, we could close the gap by doing what we’ve long needed to do: revamp our K-12 curriculum. It’s time to bring back Career Tech opportunities starting in 5th or 6th grade to give students exposure to technical career paths that don’t require a 4-year degree. One reason I left K-12 was because I felt like the curriculum was not preparing non-college-bound kids for anything beyond a job at McDonalds. It’s upsetting to have to teach a kid how to analyze a Shakespearean sonnet when you know he doesn’t need that skill."

The corporates and their management are market and profit driven; they are not driven by ideological. If anyone think its trade policy in general would lead to companies to relocate to the states, try to answer the following questions:

1) Four months in to the pandemic in the U.S., where do we get most of our masks and other PPE from now?

2) How many cars GM, Ford and Tesla produce in China annually and of which, how may are imported to the US?

3) Before the pandemic, what was the unemployment rate in the U.S.? Assuming people planning for new factories to produce things made overseas, where would they be able to get qualified workers?"

In manufacturing this usually means a factory, and the lag is much longer than with, say, a bank or an advertising agency.  Something like two years is likely a good estimate of the average.  Hence, no surprise to read that:

""Foreign-owned companies invested about half as much in the United States in 2019 as they did in 2016, the year before Mr. Trump took office. After increasing in the first two years of Mr. Trump’s presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs flatlined last year.""

Trillions in debt, infested with COVID-19, circling the drain with a destructive small minority of predatory rent-seeking elites in their gated castles, skimming whatever pathetic scraps of wealth remain in the hands of an opioid- and TV-addicted semiliterate population that tried electing a narcissistic game show host as President and now—when not denying reality outright—wonders why things are even worse than before. Meanwhile, it’s time to drive past the shuttered small town stores to the sprawling Wal-Mart built on an abandoned small farm where one can cash this month’s pittance from the government or minimum wage service job and pick up a new privacy-invading Smart TV and some plastic junk made in China, some beer and fatty corn snacks provided by a handful of Big Ag and brewing companies, and maybe some exposure to a dangerous virus, as the trade deficit, national debt, and reported COVID-19 cases continue their relentless march upwards.

2020-07-22 15:32:13,"Having worked in both corporate site selection and US economic development for a quarter century, there are two significant problems with this reporting.  First, manufacturing site selection projects are typically an 18 - 36 month effort from beginning of analysis to start of production.  It is far too early to draw conclusions based upon a pandemic that only began to impact supply chains four or five months ago.  Second, there has been a years long trend to concentrate manufacturing on a per continent basis, i.e., manufacture in Europe for the European market, North America for the North American market, etc., rather than shipping components and finished goods all around the world.  One thing that is painfully clear is that markets have drastically underpriced the risks inherent in these far flung supply chains.  When the dust settles several years from now, I predict that the U.S. will claim its fair share of manufacturing moved out of China, especially if the Biden Administration wisely provides targeted incentives and infrastructure support to encourage such."
2020-07-22 15:40:03,"I’ll be happy to never see another product made with materials from or made in part or whole in China. We’ve gone out of our way to avoid Made in China products since American companies started offshoring to that country en masse, but it has become increasingly difficult — even in Scandinavia/ EU. In America the market is so saturated with cheap, faulty, low quality, harmful Chinese craproducts that it’s nearly impossible to find anything not made there. The fact that China controls the supply chain (medical, tech, PPE, disinfectants, masks) has been one of the reasons America is in turmoil during this pandemic."
2020-07-22 15:41:15,"It doesn’t make sense to build more factories in the USA when we have an uncontrolled outbreak that requires factories to close down so that workers don’t infect each other.

It also doesn’t make sense to blame the shortages we saw earlier this year on global supply chains as opposed to sudden unexpected explosions in demand for certain products. Toilet paper is all made in the USA but there were still shortages of toilet paper for months.

Focus on controlling the virus first and the economy and manufacturing will come back naturally. The Trump administration’s statement to look on the bright side of the virus because it would bring jobs back to North America could not have been more wrong."

out its mfg. base. Once the skill is lost
it is hard to recover. Asian countries have become cost competitive to lure
the jobs away not only in manufacturing but in services too. India has large number of jobs located in IT, call centers, accounting, audit, taxes, legal and medical work. Low wages and fewer benefits drive the outsourcing of jobs. IBM shifted jobs to India to reduce the cost and report higher earnings despite declining sales.
The culprit is high healthcare cost in USA and tied to employment. It and huge bonuses to top management
drive American cost to very high level.
CEOs have found a recipe to report
higher earnings, drive the share prices
up and cash out on their stock options.
Worry not only about manufacturing but service jobs too. What  is needed is
transformation of health care and its
disconnect with the employment. Hourly wages are competitive because American worker is probably more productive than its Asian counterpart 
to keep labor unit cost close to Asian counterpart."

Looking further to the future, we should expect manufacturing to move to low-wage regions such as Latin America, Africa, and South Asia.

China will move toward high-end manufacturing such as cars, planes, and computers.

The US will retain strengths in entertainment and information technology.

Contrary to Trump, we need to plan for the 2050s, not the 1950s."
2020-07-22 19:14:09,"Expecting massive change in that direction already, in the midst of the major financial mess and uncertainty we find ourselves in, is frankly, bizarre.

Based on the myopia evident in this piece, I have serious doubts.

Lucky for Americans the Fed can print as much money as it desires, provide it to banks, corporations and eventually the consumers to pay for Chinese made goods. That's why the Chinese are forced to buy a huge amount of US Treasury bond. There is nowhere else for China to park a large amount of US$ they get for payment. And so the circular movement continues.

It is also very likely an issue in our pseudo-military government groups like the mystery thugs now being deployed to incite riots in American cities like Minneapolis.  Those transported to the cities are said to have come from border patrol duties where there is a very high virus rate. No doubt some carry the virus along with their pepper-spray. 

While the relative youth and health of our military means unit effectiveness is likely to remain, the threat of our military to the citizens in countries that have controlled the virus risks limits their value and increases their cost to every location where they are deployed."

2020-07-22 18:51:23,"This is not surprising to me. 

My active-duty-Army wife was recently transferred to a military unit that manages the care of seriously ill and injured soldiers. They have demanded that my wife show up in person several times to fill out paperwork that we could easily (and safely) have filled out at home and scanned back to them. These requirements were made despite the threat of coronavirus. Despite the fact that medical professionals staff the unit. Despite the fact the unit's purpose is to manage soldiers who are almost universally at higher risk from covid19 complications. (Her social worker even tried to guilt her into coming in person into her office so that she could put a face to the name. I suppose she has never heard of pictures or WebX.)

While my main concern is about the unnecessary risk my wife and other ill and injured soldiers are subjected to, I am also worried about what this inability to adapt to the virus will do to our readiness. And to the well-being of our forces and their loved ones.

For a military that prides itself on its resourcefulness, its agility, and its flexibility, it seems unable to adapt to the new (temporary) reality."

Many of them are violating not only the state and county health orders, but the Navy orders by not staying at home and continuing to visit with people outside of their households. It has been shocking to see the men that love to tell their tales of sacrifice and struggles while deployed refuse to put a piece of cloth on their faces to protect their nearest and dearest."
2020-07-22 23:51:49,"Having a simple mind, the virus has been around for more than two weeks.  A few months ago a military commander was relieved of his duties when the men of His ship were becoming infected. No one would listen to him . He sounded the alarm and the powers to be argued about process.

A high brass person came to the ship and demeaned the commander after he was forced out of his position because he cared about his crew 
This high brass was relieved of his duties once the insulting speech was leaked to the press ignorance has no end.  The ships original commander was never reinstated even though he was attempting to do the right thing by his crew.  The crew became a petri fish for the virus

Are we living in a world of yes men and women?can we not think critically or are we all just in a movie. The medical community has spoken endlessly about virus transmission and still we dither.

Where have the people in charge been? This is a pandemic you can’t wish it away.  The military needs to take a very long hard look at there own accountability. It’s ridiculous that in July with 143k dead we can do no better

Why   are we so ready to  enter a nuclear war  at the  drop of a dime?Are we supposed  to  feel more  secure because a  guy like Trump can  threaten ""fire and  fury like  the world has never seen""? The military command  obviously CANNOT manage its  overseas manpower on  land or  sea or  here. The corona  virus  is showing  us a lot  of  deficits in  the  way we run  our  country.
We better make a point  of  doing  better if  we want to have a decent  country with obvious  challenges like  the  corona  virus, like income   inequality, like  education, like health care if  we  want to  survive."
2020-07-23 03:05:37,"No surprise - a major transmission vector of COVID-19 is shared living spaces.  I do wonder how much of the virus is being spread by the National Guard units that have been pressed into service distributing food/equipment, etc.

To keep things in perspective, though, if it is happening here, it is happening in other countries (especially China & Russia)."
2020-07-23 12:57:45,"If Trump and his toddies could think beyond getting him re-elected and getting the British Open to his golf club in Scotland, we might have an answer to a massive problem. This is a national defense issue, and our opponents know it. All movement of military personnel should be stopped; all personnel confined to their bases - civilian dependents included, and then work on eradicate the virus inside those boundaries. The military, like China, has the authority to do this."
2020-07-22 13:16:20,"It should be noted that Trump has blown his chance to lead. “Arizonaidiots” have managed to get Covid-19 out of control because in the first three months of the pandemic Trump consistently and continually denied the deadly seriousness of the virus and undermined scientific authorities in the issue. He is directly responsible for the death of every person in this country who has rejected a mask and insisted on non existent “constitutional rights” to potentially spread the virus. There is NO national strategy. There is NO national plan. He has emboldened ignorant people not to wear a mask and not to social distance.
Trump has our blood on his hands and it is not possible for him to wash it off no matter how hard he tries."
2020-07-22 13:12:08,"Thanks for finally telling the country what we already know. It's clear he's only doing this now to try and fix his eroding numbers. He doesn't care about the people in this country. He only cares about re-election. Why, I don't know. It's obvious he hates this job. He only likes the power that comes with it. Please vote."
2020-07-22 13:16:36,"Too little, too late. Is there anyone who doesn’t see right through this con?"
2020-07-22 13:05:23,Those of us who have not yet been sickened by the Covid-19 virus are suffering from motion sickness trying to follow  Trump's  bizarre responses to this pandemic.  Will this Trump clown act ever end?
2020-07-22 13:18:41,"Even if Trump now really believes anything he said Tuesday about the reality of the pandemic and mitigation, it's about 6-7 months too late.  If he had embraced that mentality back in January-February and behaved like an actual leader, we would not be in this quagmire. He had plenty of opportunities this winter and into the spring to develop and enact a strategy.  Instead he has still managed to log days on the golf course while people die from, get sick from, and generally have their lives upended by coronavirus.  This whole act now is the essence of playing armchair quarterback.

In case anyone from the Trump administration reads these comments: If you are going to have briefings, for the sake of the country, headline them with medical and public health professionals!!!!  And for that matter, maybe headline your coronavirus task force with them too. Stop using Drs. Fauci and Birx just as political footballs."
2020-07-22 13:07:01,"Who is He kidding? He closed too late, opened too soon and now is stuck because He cannot close again. He finally found a bigger bully, and it is going to beat Him and Us up."
2020-07-22 13:09:13,"His administration has done a wonderful job even if he has not.
The Vaccine program Warp Speed will have every American 
Vaccinated in months, not years, this is Nobel worthy, and
Re-election as well"
2020-07-22 13:11:17,"Trump failed to acknowledge that his failure to act and his ""leading"" the U.S. in the wrong direction has been -- and continues to be -- the principle cause of over 3 million infections and 140,000 Americans dead.

Trump begrudgingly reading off a teleprompter to acknowledge -- months into the pandemic -- that ""things will get worse before it gets better,"" with no solutions in sight from the WH, does not signal a ""shift."""
2020-07-22 13:19:36,"It is sad that he now recognizes that it will get worse, because his failure to acknowledge its severit has brought us to this cliff.
The amazing thing is also that the trumpsters still don't take it serious.
It's too bad he politicized the virus, which will kill millions of Americans of all ages and political party."
2020-07-22 13:17:32,"I am glad the president has finally acknowledged the severity of the situation and acknowledged the benefits of masks. It is troubling he went on to suggest the virus will somehow disappear. 

It is incumbent we not let the president and his handlers rewrite history. Donald Trump's response to the pandemic has contributed greatly to unnecessary death and unnecessary economic decline in the US. If recent history is any indication, we will soon be hearing Trump say ""I was always for wearing masks"". He is already claiming his actions have saved millions and is attempting to throw Dr. Fauci under the bus.  We, the public, need to remember his anemic and impotent response to this tragedy."
2020-07-22 13:18:32,"No. Trump did not say the virus will get worse. That’s a lie. He READ OUT LOUD the virus will get worse. That’s different than he said what’s in his mind, which came a few minutes later without reading - the virus will disappear."
2020-07-22 13:19:01,"But he didn't shift. He went to his hotel the same night without wearing a mask, while he mingled with the throngs. Why does the media do this? Why does the media continue to elevate anything he does or says?"
2020-07-22 13:18:20,"While there has been very little Mr. Trump has said while in office that I find credible, I do agree with his assessment that the virus will eventually disappear. For as an adage in the medical profession goes, all bleeding stops."
2020-07-22 13:30:35,"Listening to Trump, I was surprised until it was clear to me that the polls made him sound concerned by others, as you pointed out. But even then, when asked, he did not take individual responsibility which is probably the only non-individual thing in him.

I feel comfortable predicting that this shift will not last long. We will be his own self soon enough to slip further behind Biden. I will be able to predict more when I finish reading his niece's book."
2020-07-22 13:22:47,The virus will get worse because the president has specific plans to make it worse. Never forget how many countries already have it under control. And we make ourselves the se facto laboratory for any mutations to come by hosting it so graciously... why not just end it instead?
2020-07-22 13:22:54,It’s far too late. The use of masks and social distancing are derided by conservatives as an affront to freedom. Trump fed that narrative for too long. Many conservatives will not believe that Trump means what he says on this
2020-07-22 13:26:27,"A better way to describe this is that Trump's staff prevailed on him to read a script, which he did very reluctantly. His behavior has not changed. As far as anyone knows, he is still insisting on zeroing out money for testing in the next recovery bill, presumably to reduce the number of reported cases in order to make himself look better."
2020-07-22 13:27:01,"Don't be fooled by Trump's ""New! Improved!"" coronavirus briefings. He still likes to abuse superlatives (""relentlessly""); his message should have come back in March, where even if he still sounded like a 4th Grader reading a book report to the class, it at least would've carried a hint of gravitas. 
Yet, this is more about Trump trying to salvage whatever chances he has left at reelection, than about sending a message; one that is like closing the corral after the horses ran away.
If Biden's handlers are smart, they should stop at nothing to keep voters memories of this, the economy, BLM, and now federal agents in camo, rounding up protesters like cattle; along with the push for schools to open on time, as well as his conflating of patriotism, from fading. And, there's that pointlessly insincere nod to Ghislaine Maxwell."
2020-07-22 13:27:22,"I am glad Trump has come around to the truth, but it is too late for the thousands of Americans who have died while he denied it.  And thousands more will die if he does not mandate masks and social distancing.  Trump's political career is over, but he can still do the right thing for America."
2020-07-22 13:29:52,"Is this another one of his sarcastic comments? How do we tell?
Trump has indicated before that he has joked about the state of America’s health. As if only he had the license to joke about a national crisis. 
Why should we trust him now?"
2020-07-22 13:28:38,Once again the truth backs Donald into a corner.   You cannot gaslight a virus.
2020-07-22 13:27:51,"A day late, and a dollar short. Is slow boat trump finally able to see the dawn of reality? Nope. trump...what conservatives get when they pick the dullest tool in the shed. You all have made your bed, now lay in it! And go away. Time for the adults to clean up your mess. Such is life."
2020-07-22 13:24:46,Wow! Such seriousness. And masks? Genius. Who could ever think of that? Very presidential stuff. Bold. Decisive. I'm so impressed. He's obviously changed. In complete command. Ratings through the roof. Covid will be gone in no time. America is saved!!!!!!
2020-07-22 13:26:56,It looked like a hostage video: he so clearly did not want to be there reading from that script. Before the end of the week he'll be back to his usual incoherent ranting.
2020-07-22 13:21:42,"If the president is tested so frequently, having that swab up so deep, so often, could help explain the inanity of his thinking."
2020-07-22 13:25:58,"It's way too late for this pathetic stunt.  Trump can't pretend the last six+ months just never happened, and that he didn't blatantly ignore, dismiss, and lie about the pandemic instead of taking charge and protecting the country, like his job requires.  He's failed America for the last time."
2020-07-22 13:29:48,"Let’s stop praising the president for doing his job. The story should be that he still doesn’t care. He could barely muster what he said and keeps his eyes down towards his piece of paper the whole time. The story should be how many deaths this president is responsible for. And I’m sorry, but those reporters don’t question him well. He keeps saying this thing implying, ‘well, I’m president, people stay 6 feet away, I get tested everyday, everyone around me gets tested, so there’s a time and place for masks.’ Hammer him for this! This is such an elitist rich man point of view. The reporters in the room need to do a better time questioning him real time on his false narratives. And you, NYTimes need to do better at not falling for these “oh trump did something good for once let’s praise him” type of stories. He’s playing you. Why are you not hammering him and Congress about his repeated impeachable offenses? The Roger Stone pardon is an impeachable offense. I only heard one TV reporter ask Pelosi and she deflected the question and the reporter didn’t dog her on it. How is this terrible response also not an impeachable offense? Ten counts of obstruction? Asking to move the British Open is the same thing he did with Ukraine! Why should the president get some kind of “impeachment immunity” in an election year?? He knows this and knows you won’t question him because you don’t want to upset the poll numbers. He’s playing you."
2020-07-22 13:23:52,Trump telling the American people how bad the pandemic is. That it will not disappeared.  Do you believed in miracle?
2020-07-22 13:33:54,Trump was about six months late with that speech.
2020-07-22 13:35:05,I wish him well.
2020-07-22 13:36:11,"Once again, trump did a poor job of reading somebody else’s words yesterday at the press conference..  His affect when he’s forced to rely on other’s words - usually Stephen Miller’s - is one of boredom and disinterest in the topic.  He’s not up there caring about the American people and giving critical information on the scope of the virus, no, he’s just trying this new approach to campaigning for his re-election.  Don’t watch!  Get him out of there!  Vote!  Vote!  Vote!"
2020-07-22 13:30:33,"I took the bait and decided to watch yesterday’s briefing. My first thought - what did they slip into his Coke to make him calmer? (Joke)  

The Republican options for additional financial relief, once again, will benefit the wrong people. Providing liability protection for businesses?  How about providing protection for the workers at those companies - either financially or health wise?  Testing will be key to getting this virus under control."
2020-07-22 13:35:40,"Too little, way too late.

Where were the scientists yesterday? 

This was just another publicity stunt for a sad and lonely man."
2020-07-22 13:38:43,"ridiculous performance.

Question for the reporter:  didn't trump first wear a mask during a tour of a manufacturing plant?  this article says he first wore the mask at Walter Reed"
2020-07-22 13:42:30,"which way is the wind blowing today?
how were the ratings? (i didn't watch)

in my opinion, the most important comment had nothing to do with the pandemic. trump had supportive words for ghislaine maxwell - a person alleged to have been involved in underage child sex trafficking. it will be up to a jury to rule, but there's a lot of smoke there. she isn't somebody i would want to be associated with and it's upsetting to see and hear the president give support. then again, he pardons and commutes the sentences of war criminals, political felons, and other bottom feeders.

the commentary is not surprising - 

now he likes masks
now it's going to be worse before it's better

but he's doing a fantastic job."
2020-07-22 13:43:43,"He waited 5 MONTHS--causing 140,000 deaths. Of Americans. Think about it..."
2020-07-22 13:48:26,How odd. Why would Trump wish for the well-being of a sex trafficker who provided underage girls to Jeffrey Epstein and other rich and powerful men?
2020-07-22 14:23:00,Cognitive testing worked.
2020-07-22 14:02:03,Did not watch. Time is precious and listening to a group of liars is just not worth it. Vote them out.
2020-07-22 14:18:47,Only 3 months and tens of thousand unnecessary deaths late!  He's definitely starting to get the hang of this thing.
2020-07-22 14:18:54,"So it only took Trump five months to take the ""Democrat Hoax"" and the ""Fake News"" seriously.  I thought Trump was lying when he implied that he had aced his dementia test, but maybe this proves he did."
2020-07-22 14:20:45,"Yesterday we read that if Dr. Fauci is too strong in his opinions, we won’t hear from him for a while. Today we get coverage of yet another inane White House press conference without our public health representatives.

Question: isn’t it up to Journalism to decide who we hear from? Why are we getting so much coverage of nonsense? NYT doesn’t work for the White House. Other journalists, professionals, and entertainers are speaking with Dr. Fauci.

NYT should keep the public health message at the front - forget the drama, just keep repeating the message. If the president utters absolute nonsense again, I don’t need the details. It isn’t front page-worthy. Stop shining the spotlight on this man until he starts to give us information. 

At the moment, I have to go to Khan Academy to hear Dr. Fauci discuss re-opening schools safely. Shouldn’t NYT be doing that? (Thanks to Sal Khan, Dr. Fauci, and others for stepping up!)"
2020-07-22 14:28:08,Too little too late.
2020-07-22 14:28:23,"There will be another pivot.

Because Trump can’t help himself—he is a hater and his hatred will always come out.

It is already too late for Trump to behave like an adult."
2020-07-22 14:00:47,"""we have embers and fire and big fires"" So maybe if we tell Trump that he failed to ""clean the forest properly"" as he told Calif. during the brush fires, he might grasp the gravity and reality  of the situation. When Smokey says, ""only you can prevent forest fires', he is talking to you too, Mr Pres.

"" anything that could help and can potentially help is a good thing""  Gee, Mr Pres. so how is bleach and hydroychloroquine a 'good thing' and your desire to cut funding for more testing and tracing not 'a good thing'?

""wearing a mask is  a patriotic thing""... Trump doesn't  wear a mask, so we must assume he is not really patriotic....seems to fit the narrative.

McEnany states "" not urgent for President to wear a mask since he is tested regularly"".  Which must mean that every American should wait until they have been tested 'positive' before they need to start wearing a mask..... makes perfect sense, especially if you work in the WH or you are 'patriotic.'

And so it goes....."
2020-07-22 14:28:40,Trump's comment on Ghislaine Maxwell was perplexing. Unless of course he's making a strong pitch for the child sex trafficking demographic.
2020-07-22 13:54:24,Total lack of leadership of the federal administration during this pandemic.
2020-07-22 13:57:11,"WORST and will be more severe because trump-pence-mcconnell & the gOP fired the CDC pandemic experts and lied to our citizens from the start. US citizens who trusted them were infected and died. Minimally criminal negligence.

Countries like Taiwan who followed the Obama's pandemic playbook have returned to normal. Countries like Canada who followed the basics… masks, distancing and washing, have 1/10 our infection and death RATE.

What leadership!"
2020-07-22 14:17:17,He talked about Ghislaine Maxwell during his Coronavirus briefing?!  Stated that he knows her and wishes her well?? This is a red flag to all of us not in Donald Trump's cult that she knows something about him.
2020-07-22 14:23:29,I’m sure his sagging poll numbers brought about this epiphany. He should be held to account for willfully misleading the American public from the onset.  He should publicly apologize for ever referring to the coronavirus as a  “hoax”. He’d wait until your house burned to the ground before he’d concede there was a fire.
2020-07-22 13:46:10,"Now, nearly half a year and 143,000 deaths later, Trump finally acknowledges that coronavirus is not a ""hoax"" and urges Americans to wear masks. Guess this leaves DeSantis swinging in the wind. His Red State MAGA sycophants will not be happy — if they're not already on a ventilator."

	1.	We really don’t care where the virus came from and just want it gone from our country.			

	2.	You need to have your people speak with Andrew Cuomo’s people about how to use graphics properly during a press conference. 

	3.	You continue to misrepresent the statistics and continue to lie.

	4.  	You should definitely keep holding the press conferences going forward for the benefit of the future of our country.

	P.S. 	You should be very worried about the British Open and Epstein scandals.

		I wish you well."
2020-07-22 13:56:48,"The next time Trump says in an interview or press conference regarding one of any problems that he “doesn’t believe it,” I hope some journalist has the sense to ask the follow-up question, “Sir [we know he loves to be called “sir”], you said you didn’t believe in masks for 6 months during the pandemic. Your view on masks played a significant role in devastating our economy and resulted in a death toll that will near 200,000. Why should we believe you this time?”"
2020-07-22 14:18:13,How is that his comments wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well are buried in the bottom of an article that basically says he’s doing this for political reasons and the little he said was non substantive and useless from a public health perspective?
2020-07-22 14:06:13,Trump sounded like a Professor at Trump University giving a lecture in his Revisionist History Class.
2020-07-22 13:52:22,Trump's approval poll numbers are tanking.  That's why the about face on issues like masks and the pandemic.   Believe NOTHING he says.  And where was Dr. Fauci?.  I heard he was not invited to this briefing

2020-07-22 14:16:00,"Religious conservatives obsessed with forcing women to carry unwanted fetuses to term elected this man and the party that has shielded him throughout his disastrous tenure.

2020-07-22 14:20:22,"Over 140,000 Americans are dead. Millions infected. We've had 1,000 deaths per day this week. All because of the utter failure of the Trump administration, and his obedient Republicans in office both in Washington and nationally. I don't say this lightly, but the Republican party has caused more damage and killed more Americans than Al Qaeda ever did or could. Not only have they failed to keep us safe, or to enact rational, nation-wide policies to help, they are actively working to sabotage our health, our government, our rule of law, and are looting our treasury while they do it. They are without a doubt the greatest threat we face to our future health and our national existence."
2020-07-22 14:30:30,"Where is Trump's apology to the American people?  Now he says, masks work.  What about all the needless deaths and illnesses, the jobs and housing lost, due to the failing economy that he caused by not acknowledging early on that the virus is NOT a hoax and is NOT going to just go away on its own?

Where is his apology????  If we had tackled this earlier in the ways the experts recommended, coivd-19 would not be out of control in so many areas and our kids would be looking forward to going back to school!"
2020-07-22 14:00:50,"So Donald Trump finally admitted to the very presence of a pandemic in yesterday's robotic and phlegmatic ""news conference"", prophetically declaring that matters would get worse before they got better! Wow!  A seven year-old could have predicted that back in April.   But after all, this self-proclaimed ""stable genius""  DID manage to ace a basic mental status test which is administered to rule out dementia, only to brag about his performance to Chris Wallace on Fox.  While Mr. Trump has rightfully  earned the scorn of the American public, in light of his rapid and severe mental decline, he also deserves our pity."
2020-07-22 14:19:51,"Big deal.

20,000 lies and counting means Trump has ZERO credibility about anything.  A cardboard cutout has more sincerity and empathy."
2020-07-22 13:59:41,Who ARE these people who make up the 51% who think he's handling the virus well? It's like believing that water runs uphill despite all evidence to the contrary. Who are these people??
2020-07-22 14:08:06,It took him five months to figure this out. Are we sure he didn’t cheat on that cognitive test?
2020-07-22 14:10:23,Previously Trump said people who wore masks did it to show their dislike of him.  Now Trump says wearing a mask is patriotic.  What will it take for his supporters to turn?  Does the President have to the accuse the Army of being a communist organization?

2020-07-22 14:17:37,"The only reason trump is changing his tune is because Mr. Biden is trouncing him in the polls. I will not forget trump's ineptitude and outright bumbling and bungling the response to this pandemic. I will not forget his anti-science, anti- mask, anti-Fauci, anti anything that has to do with responsibility and caring for people. I will hope that all of the republicans and anyone who put a dollar above a life in this time of crisis lose their positions in government."

What a wonderful thing it would have been to have had competent leadership in our hour of need.

Now look."
2020-07-22 14:16:57,Trump replaced his campaign manager and his tactics have changed. That is all.
2020-07-22 14:19:28,"The president again insisted the virus would “disappear” but conceded that it remained serious. “We have embers and fires, and we have big fires, and unfortunately now Florida is in a little tough or in a big tough position,” he said.

A little tough or big tough position?

In all seriousness, the toddlers we know speak more coherently than this guy."
2020-07-22 13:54:15,"As with all con artists, Trump works hard to get us to focus on what he says, not what he does. Misdirection is his forte... say one thing ""Wearing a mask is patriotic... I have no problem with masks... I carry it... I wear it..."", do something completely different, deny any contradiction.

The only reliable thing about his renewed briefings is that sooner or later he's going to cram his own foot into his own mouth and continue to confirm for everyone watching that he is unstable and unfit for office."
2020-07-22 14:07:38,"“But even after posting a Twitter message on Monday urging masks, the president was spotted that night at his Washington hotel mingling with guests without wearing one.”

This is the important thing to take away from Mr. Baker’s report.  The press briefing was staged at the urging of desperate aides who read polls.  The NYT should and could do better than continue to translate for this incoherent president, but if you must continue to do that at least expose it for what it is.

After the uncomfortable charade of attempting to appear to care, he goes to a fundraiser with his kind of people, all of whom no doubt have ready access to testing so they can hobnob freely with worrying about getting sick.   All while the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves and hope we are safe.   Those already sickened  are not his concern."
2020-07-22 14:16:40,Agree with the many commentators saying this is too little too late and done only as a political ploy due to sagging poll numbers. I also wonder how long he will be able to keep up the relatively disciplined messaging before descending into his usual self-indulgent rambling. It's not going to be long coming.
2020-07-22 14:00:06,"He does realize that testing is not a vaccine against Covid 19, doesn't he?  That it doesn't matter if he gets  tested twice a day or once every two days (he might not understand the difference) it won't prevent him from getting Covid 19?"
2020-07-22 14:09:09,"The norm today: Trump is consistently late in his recognition of a problem. Trump has never ""acted appropriately.""
Trump has yet to take a role in a resolution for this pandemic.  Instead he creates crisis after crisis. He does not have the ability. All we know is how he can recognize and name a camel from his cognitive test.

Strange that Trump is the 'most tested' when the average citizen cannot be tested and if tested, has to wait some 10 days for the results, be in long lines.

I can only hope this next election will be the test that really matters. Americans need desperately for change and a real path to recovery. Unfortunately, many more will die from the lack of attention."
2020-07-22 14:14:06,"If I know something will get worse, I think I will do something positive to prevent it from getting that worse. Even more, to do my effort to possibly make it better."
2020-07-22 13:45:44,"Like many  I want to listen to White House press conferences so I am an informed citizen. So yesterday I watched President Trump speak about covid-19 until he told the first lie. Then I turned it off. ""... he again congratulated himself on his handling of the pandemic, admitted no missteps and made a number of specious claims...""  The President refuses to get out of the way and let the experts deal with this. We can't change what's already happened, but we can influence what will happen. Let's focus on easing the suffering.  President Trump, please step aside."

What has stopped this from happening?  Months of denial from an incompetent president.  He cannot undo that now, with a daily briefing, tweets, campaign ads or anything else.


So many have died unnecessarily.  This will be his legacy."

2020-07-22 14:30:49,"The office of the presidency changes every individual that occupies it. Like winning the lottery, it also magnifies the character flaws that already existed.

It is much too late to put ""New and Improved!"" on this box of cereal."
2020-07-22 14:17:08,"I live in a hopping part of Vermont - a vacation destination. Yesterday, while parked on the street and waiting for my husband to retrieve take-out from our favorite Indian restaurant, I saw a huge number of tourists, families mostly, walking up and down the street. I noticed that a large number of fathers/adult males in these families were not wearing masks, even when their partners and children were. There seems to be an underlying issue of men, in particular, refusing to wear masks, despite familial norms to the contrary. I don't understand. I've seen it so much that it's not just a fluke. It's everywhere - women and children with the masks, accompanying men without. Is this a machismo thing? Is it not manly to survive and prevent the spread of a deadly virus to vulnerable people? 

Isn't wearing a mask and defending the vulnerable the MOST manly thing a person can do? 

I don't get it. I don't see a lot of articles about gender influence on mask-wearing...but I'm curious (as well as enraged) about it. Anyone else experiencing this in their neck of the woods?"
2020-07-22 13:14:08,"Another notch on trump's comedy belt!

It is welcomed advice, but a little too little, too late. Too many have suffered and too many have died.

This political announcement is nothing more than the vast  what majority of Americans already knew. 

But, perhaps it will do some good by opening the eyes of those who have blindly followed trump's previous bravado and have effectively been the vectors of disease leading America into this current mess."
2020-07-22 13:09:36,"Let’s be clear where the blame rests: squarely at the president’s feet. He insisted on reopening, unchecked pandemic aside. He encouraged people to storm state capitals. He didn’t wear a mask until last week. He downplayed the virus at every turn and patted himself in the back for a job well done as the number of cases soared. Media, forever grading him on a curve, are focused more on his tone (and doling praise for it) rather than his incompetence and the fact that, six months in, he still has no plan. None of this had to be inevitable. Other developed countries have managed far better—even Italy, which was the worst hit European country."
2020-07-22 14:03:20,"here's the truth: the president didn't really give a darn when the ""liberal"" states that didn't go for him in the election OR states controlled by democrats were being ravaged by Covid-19. 

in fact, he did his best to undermine those states' efforts,  calling to ""LIBERATE"" them from their necessary closures and eschewing masking at every opportunity. he seemed to even take pleasure at times when those governors pleaded for ventilators and a national plan of action.

now, the states he ""loves"" are suffering -- florida, texas, georgia -- and so now he is more moved to take some, even if limited, actions. 

yet, we should never forget that when the refrigerated trucks were called in to house the bodies of our dead in NYC, he seemed more interested in needling Cuomo than lifting a finger to help us here in ""liberal"" America."
2020-07-22 15:02:41,Trump was reading all of this off a piece of paper. He never can speak from the heart. The only reason he said what he said is because he is behind in the polls. Trump needs to realize that all his words do not erase the past. None of what he said changes my vote. I am for America first. That is not what Trump represents.

At this point, that is probably all we can hope for from a very broken and dangerously powerful guy."
2020-07-22 14:35:36,"Trump's change is not a ""shift"". Before this week the Cowering Inferno was making fun of mask wearing. To call his change of attitude toward mask wearing a ""shift"" is a gross distortion of reality.
On the Ghislane Maxwell matter, it is obvious that Trump was inviting Maxwell to dummy up and she could hope for a presidential pardon. Now why would he be doing that? Even a stupid Republican should be able to figure that out."

America is terrified.

What kind of monster ignores the enormity of such pain, suffering and traumatizing loss and offers no plan or strategy to stop the spread?

But in fact calls for actions that actually help spread the virus and increase the deaths.

Why did Donald Trump, who himself gets tested often several times a day, withhhold $7-8 Billion in congressional allocated for testing, shut down many needed federal lab sites, demand a test slow down and now is calling for defunding the critical testing needed to save lives.

What kind of insane creature makes it a point during a coronavirus briefing to extend his ""well wishes"" (twice) to his good friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of sex trafficking underage girls.

In the mean time we have more than 145,000 death of Americans and 3.5 millions affected with virus. Now is the time Trump has to take the responsibility for all these deaths and sufferings. He owes apology to Americans. He is very slow learner. When the FOX Pundits will learn the truth and speak the truth? Please do not misguide the ordinary viewers and increase their sufferings."

If his Cabinet was patriotic and cared about Americans, they would invoke the 25th Amendment and find Trump incapable of fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of his office.  Failing that Congress should initiate legislation to appoint a group of people to rule on his fitness for office, also as provided for in the 25th Amendment.

Trumps's actions - or failure to act - goes beyond gross negligence and reckless disregard.  He should be convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of over 100,000 Americans - allowing that a few were outside his control.  And he should be held civilly liable for trillions of dollars in damages."

   Misinformation. We do not have the ""best"" mortality rate. Our testing program is not the greatest. * hour waits to get a test, 7 to 10 day delays to get results, these are not the sign of a 'great system, the envy of the world."" His constant gaslighting is giving people a false sense of security, thus making the problem worse.

All the facts are out there. All the evidence is out there. All the shenanigans are out there. If you are inapt enough to acknowledge that then you deserve what you get. 

The November results will portray to the  rest of the world the mindset, aptitude and mental fitness of the American diaspora. ""Maybe America was never great enough"". ""Or maybe America is not so great after all"". It may expose the greatest hoax that ever was.

To be born an American is easy. To be a real American in heart and soul is entirely another matter. It requires a lot of hard work, constant soul searching, reflection and above all unconditional patriotism. What is good for America is good for me. Not what is good for me is good for America.

2020-07-22 14:45:00,"It's so otherworldly bizarre that Trump said ""I wish her well"" TO Ghislaine Maxwell. He was in code telling her to do a Roger Stone. No public health officials, short talk. All about a pardon."

This change in messaging appears to be designed to set Trump up to claim, in an attempt at an October surprise, that he rescued us from the ""big fires"" 

Most of us know by now that the ""big fires"" were caused by Trump's incompetence, inattention and arrogance in early January ---and even earlier getting rid of the CDC's epidemiology office in China--, extending through the present, now trying to hide case numbers and pretend he is doing something about the shocking lack of attention to the very testing and tracing that could have saved tens of thousands of lives if started aggressively as soon as the virus RNA sequence was available in January.

With this new ""I care"" strategy, will Trump, Putin and Fox be able to fool enough people in October?"

2020-07-22 14:57:05,Trumps statement “It will get a lot worse before it gets better” is not born out of a late blooming revelation of the true course of the pandemic.

His endorsement of wearing a face mask yet neither he nor the gentleman in the photo wore one reinforces what so many of his supporters continue to believe - if Trump ain't wearing one, either am I.  If wearing one was really that important, Trump would be wearing one.

Classic Trump - conflicting and mixed messages - now on live prime time."

South Korea set up robust testing and tracing programs and promoted universal mask wearing. The US did not do any of those things. In fact, Trump left it up to the states to fight amongst themselves for PPE and testing supplies.

Yesterday, South Korea -- with an overall population of 51 million -- had 45 new cases.

Yesterday, the US -- with an overall population of 330 million -- had over 65,000 new cases.

Is this psychotic delusion? Pathological arrogance? What can possibly explain a belief that this incurable, highly contagious disease, which has swept through the entire world, might just ""go away""? 

Trump and his supporters have always found it easy to deny facts and doubt basic realities that don't match their agenda. (By now it's a Republican tradition: ""'We create our own reality,"" an aide to George W. Bush famously claimed.) But this is something more. This is some kind of urge to mass murder. 

More and more, Trump and his team sound like the insane Roman Emperor Caligula, who wished that he could ""reduce the entire world to a single neck destined for the axe."" Trump's narcissism is so extreme that he seems ready to go down in history as a rival to Hitler, Stalin, or Mao for his sheer destructiveness. If he's reelected, it now looks like he's aiming to start a war with China. Yes, he would be willing to do that merely to distract from his own failures.

This idea of ""you'll hear more about (fill in the blank) in two weeks"" is a blatant dodge. Herr Trump is incapable of followthrough on anything. He doesn't know how and neither does anybody in his administration.

July 2, 2020  Ghislaine Maxwell is arrested and will be tried by the Brooklyn federal prosecutor.  She asserts that she has evidence of all of the people who have had sex with underage girls and will use that information to get a lighter sentence.

July 10, 2020 Trump and Barr replace the Brooklyn federal prosecutor with a flunky.  

July 21, 2020 Trump publicly announces his support for  Ghislaine Maxwell, similarly as he did for others of his friends and cronies who were under investigation or prosecution, to show them that if they kept their mouth shut he'd have their backs.  And then has shown that that he will follow through.  

This is not a coincidence.  It is his playbook.  He does it in public.  We just continue to not be able to comprehend the depth of his corruption and depravity and just can't bring ourselves as a country to accept that it is true.

Anyone who doesn't think she has information on him and that their now prosecutor won't offer her a sweet deal in exchange for that information not coming out has not been paying attention."

Oh, wait a minute - it was a woman, a Democrat, Janet Reno, who did the right thing - immediately - and said “the buck stops with me” about the Waco disaster.  Wake up!  

Never could Trump, even in anyone’s imagination, request to have a buck stop with him.  Asking people now to wear a mask?  He’s got his fingers crossed below the podium.  Don't kid yourself.    He’s probably been partially anesthetized by his pals to blurt that out.  He couldn’t care less if anyone wears a mask."

Trump's lame press briefing displayed a man reading in monotone off a prepared script, totally detached from the horrors of this pandemic. He was pained to admit things will get worse, not pained for the suffering of people but pained that it hurts his chances for reelection. When asked why his health experts were not present his answer was Dr. Birx is outside, so as to not interfere with his having the podium alone. At this point, after all his failures to properly address this crisis, daily press briefings are futile, and it is just a question of time before Trump feels he is being boxed in to tell the truth and he will go off script, most likely to spout false optimism in a sea of trouble."

He is a sham actor, reading his lines and then going back to his real self. Kinda of like the failed businessman  with 7 bankruptcies playing a successful one on TV.

He jumps the gun more often than not, and then comes back later, without any remote penance, and does some sort of course correction. Not endorsing the importance of ''mask'' was one of his follies, to say the least. 

Consequently, the current US government makes quite a few yearn for the past, not too dissimilar to the feelings of a French Novelist Marcel Proust whose nostalgia, perhaps, was a driving force for his book ''la recherche du temps perdu''. Those were the days, when Clinton, Bush, and Obama can be construed as do-gooders, vis-e-vis DJT. 

His administration has been casting aspersions on some of the top bigwigs in the public health arena. Anthony Fauci is the current bête noire, among many others, not to mention Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia probe. He also has been oppugning even common sense, and more pathetic it could not have been. Somebody ought to deliver a sockdolager to Trump's gibberish. As a consequence of the jiggery-pokery from Trump's acolytes, the status of the US as a just superpower is at the cusp of encountering a degringolade.

We've ignored everything Trump has had to say about this catastrophe. 
Please don't tell us Trump has had a ""shift"" just because he was forced to read some stuff off a teleprompter in public yesterday.
We all know what he is, and what he is not. 
He is obsolete, out of touch and out of time.
We do not want to see his name in anymore headlines, until he is dragged out of the White House for incompetence."
2020-07-22 15:11:52,"He and he alone is to blame for the thousands of needless deaths because of his ignorant attitude at the onset of this Pandemic.   Now he wants to look like a hero.  Much too late.   He's just not the hero type.   Of course his naive supporters will cheer him on as his ratings keep dropping.   Cases are still surging; yesterday 1000 deaths.   He read a little speech written for him, but he could barely read it and without any feeling.   I'll stick with Dr. Fauci, he tells us what to expect, while trump keeps saying it will go away.   I wish he would go away.  His legacy will read, ""blood on his hands""."
2020-07-22 15:14:57,"""President Trump acknowledged on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic was growing more severe in the United States and endorsed mask wearing in a shift after weeks of playing down the seriousness of the crisis that has killed more than 140,000 Americans.""

Correction: Trump hasn't been playing down the seriousness of the virus for ""weeks,"" he's been doing it for more than 6 months.   If you recall, on January 22 of this year, Trump said, “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”"
2020-07-22 15:23:21,"Trump is the magic slate president.  If a previous tremendously  avowed stance becomes politically untenable, it's abandoned with no acknowledgment that he had been mistaken. Thus--in the latest egregious example--the virus which had been fading away to zero is suddenly going to get worse and masks that ""cause problems"" are now ""patriotic"" to wear. Of course magic slates can't have consciences, while Trump lacks one."
2020-07-22 15:35:01,This should remind everyone of just how deeply concerned Donald Trump is about the welfare of Donald Trump.
2020-07-22 15:07:07,"Trump also needs to pivot towards speaking proper English and standing upright.

And yes, walking down a ramp."
2020-07-22 15:37:38,"If I can touch my iPhone and it recognizes me by my fingerprint I just don’t know why it isn’t able to do the same and tell me as well if I have coronavirus.  Listening to all the grumbling, this was the first thing Trump should have ordered Apple and Google to come up with way back in March since testing is so easy and he blew it.  Now it’s just a political football and I’m still stuck wearing a mask and not leaving the house."
2020-07-22 15:39:01,Of course it will get worse.  We've still got Trump as president for at least 6 more month.  Either he'll be gone then or we all might as well plan on dying.
2020-07-22 15:47:02,Trump's shifting and incoherent response to the coronavirus threat only suggests his lack of control over the situation and also a nervousness before the elections.
2020-07-22 15:10:52,"These new ""coronavirus briefings"" are just campaign events for Trump. They take the place of his rallies and are simply so  he can continue to congratulate himself, talk about how great he is and whine about how poorly  he's treated. I don't think that it's ever really sunk in at all with him that we are real people, scared about about our futures and our families. Many of us have lost our jobs permanently. We don't care if Trump thinks he's great. He just sees people as numbers on a chart--how many voted for me? How many came to my rallies? How many watched me on TV? He doesn't have a clue about how we feel or what we think, and what's worse, he doesn't care at all. He is absolutely unable to connect with other human beings. For him, it's just Trump, all the time."
2020-07-22 15:16:54,Trump is desperate to stay in office lest he be shackled and taken to prison in January. So telling us to wear masks and be ready for it getting worse before it gets better may be the message playback in his mind for his own lifestyle heading for a huge drop in the riches he has undeservedly enjoyed all his life.
2020-07-22 15:17:54,"Perhaps if everyone apologized to Trump and told him I love you man, then he would actually do something meaningful to help with the virus.

Does he still intend to fight to cut funding for testing?

I for one turn the TV channel, or DVR the news so I don't have to listen to his narcissistic drivel.  

And BTW, Trump didn't endorse masks.  

He merely said the words."
2020-07-22 15:22:17,"Too little too late.  Trump has proven himself to be inadequate to the tasks involved in being a leader during a crisis.  All he does is bluster, lie, intimidate, and make himself the injured party.  What about the nearly 140K Americans who have died?  What about their families, friends, and co-workers?  What about the people who have lost their jobs, access to health care, are going to be or have been evicted, whose stress levels are through the roof because of his negligence?  

Donald Trump and the GOP own this entire fiasco, lock, stock and barrel.  They decided to ignore it.  They decided not to provide sufficient aid.  They decided, in the states with GOP governors, not to enforce any quarantine rules or let mayors decide that their residents had to wear a mask in public.  They are the ones with the attitude problems.  

All of them should be removed from office.  Trump should be impeached again for betraying his oath of office.  So too should the rest of his cabinet, McConnell, and the remaining GOP leadership who have remained silent while Trump ruined the economy, our health, etc.  As Obama said, elections have consequences.  2016 is having consequences far more disastrous than anyone could have conceived.  

The only benefit now for Trump wearing a mask is its ability to muffle some of his more outrageous lies.  I doubt his supporters will."
2020-07-22 15:12:16,"I think the reality of his poll numbers has finally hit him on that hairdo of his.  Consequently, he is going to try a new tactic.  It's all about his re-election.  It has nothing to do with leading by example."
2020-07-22 15:31:10,"There was no shift. Trump, watching his hopes for re-election fading, is desperately trying to reverse the trend through media manipulation and pandering to his shrinking base. 
Even while claiming to reverse course, he couldn’t bring himself to take wearing a mask seriously, sending signals to those who still support him that it’s ok to avoid it and other life savings measures that would slow down the pandemic spreading fire."
2020-07-22 15:05:35,"That Trump has the option of unlimited tests, and instant ones at that, only points up the disparity in the harnessing of this pandemic. The rest of the country has to wait and battle to get tested, and on top of that, wait days for the results.  An asymptotic person could be spreading this virus in that time, making their tests useless. This is a prime example of the noblesse oblige privilege that has always imbued his attitude toward others, and unfortunately, this country has become a captive of the results of that."
2020-07-22 15:12:57,"Looking beyond the ""surface reactions"" to the briefing yesterday, this man is clearly mentally ill. Wish there was more attention given to the underlying medical symptoms also on display."
2020-07-22 15:52:40,"Now that trump admits this pandemic is going to get worse, don't you feel comfortable spending a few billion more on a vaccine that may or may not work ?
  Bring out your dead ."
2020-07-22 15:54:41,"Trump says, ""he wishes her well"", in response to a reporter's question at the faux coronavirus ""briefing"", regardingJeffrey Epstein associate and suspected sex trafficker, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Trump no doubt signaling to Maxwell that he will take care of her legal problems, ala Roger Stone, as long as she doesn't implicate him as a participant in Epstein's heinous activities."
2020-07-22 16:06:14,"What is the point in Trump being tested daily, or weekly? 
What will he do if he tests positive- double up on his hydroxychloroquine and gargle with bleach?  Maybe he is afraid of infecting Mike Pence, and then they would both be out of commission and Nancy Pelosi would be running the country."
2020-07-22 16:13:45,"It took over 6 months for the “stable genius” to read a prepared statement that there is a pandemic in the country he’s supposed to lead.

Neither stable nor genius. He aced his ability to read, he failed miserably in his ability to comprehend."
2020-07-22 15:56:03,"Trump has surrendered the US to every whim, faction, dictator, disease, disaster, attack anywhere in the universe. He will survive no matter how many of our lives he will recklessly, thoughtlessly and gleefully destroy. He will never be caught, never suffer and never feel one electron of guilt or remorse."
2020-07-22 16:04:37,"The Emperor has his new set of clothes, yet still no mask."
2020-07-22 15:51:06,"Trump is nothing more than a weather vane. Who knows which side of the coronavirus mask debate he will be on by dinnertime.   He is till giving big business heaps of money with no strings attached, other than to vote for him."
2020-07-22 15:51:56,now let's watch desantis and Kemp follow his lead as usual.. than all of a sudden everybody should wear masks.
2020-07-22 15:53:35,"Trump’s failure to deal with the COVID crisis is quite simply spectacular. He really only had this one thing to do during his term in office. The economy was handed to him on a silver platter by his predecessor. His party controlled the Senate, so there was no real struggle there in terms of getting conservative judges on the bench. Republicans don’t legislate, so there was  nothing much to do there, either. Seen in that light, all the golfing and tweeting is almost understandable. He must have wondered what all the fuss about being president was over. This job is easy!

Then along came an actual challenge. Along came an opportunity for Trump to show us just how remarkable he claims to be. An opportunity for him to flex that genius mind of his and to show us once and for all that no one knows better about (fill-in-the-blank) than Donald Trump. And the result? Dead Americans. Lots of them. And the economy in ruin. It is difficult to find another instance in American history in which the chief executive has wrought this sort of destruction upon our nation. For no one knows more about failure than Donald Trump.

I hope that there are enough “undecided” folks out there to realize the depth of this failure. This is beyond partisanship. Beyond abortion or conservative judges or whatever your pet issue is. This profoundly incompetent dumpster fire has the blood of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens on his hands. If you are OK with that then we have truly lost this democracy."
2020-07-22 16:00:37,"I think Trump's analogy of the COVID-19 virus to""embers"" and ""big fires"" is in particularly very poor taste with much of the West, Northwest and Southwest at the front door of the 2020 fire season.  

Thankfully, there have not been any full blown blazes as of yet, but it's only late July and the hot and dry summer has a long ways to go before the season ends."
2020-07-22 16:26:50,"Let's not heap praise on Caligula for his sudden spasm of theatrical near-competence. Everything this gangster does is a stunt. He's not ""shifting"" anything. he's pandering. How about a headline reflecting that?"
2020-07-22 16:46:07,"Oh dear. Trump may not meet or speak with Dr. Fauci, but as they passed in the hall, Dr. Fauci slipped Trump a note with a big number on it. Like International Criminal Court tribunal genocide/crimes against humanity-type numbers."
2020-07-22 17:01:14,"“It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he resumed the televised coronavirus briefings that he had called off in late April. “Something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is. It’s what we have.”  No  Donald, you misspoke, you left out a word, facilitated i.e.- It’s what we have facilitated.
   What a spectacle America is making of it’s self, what a horrific tragedy the Trump Administration and the Republican Party has facilitated and I add unfortunately Congress continues to facilitate - the GOP is far from grand anymore.
   This pestilence has spread all over the globe, some are dealing with it more successfully than others as the data shows. 
   Publicly announcing something that the entire world already knows is not a sign of a genius, rather, it demonstrates abject obtuseness. 
   Good Luck America, it is many times quite painful and labourious to critically examine self and debunk the delusions, but the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks. 
Best Regards"
2020-07-22 17:04:28,"Let Mr. Trump be under no illusion that people are too stupid not to know what caused the change in his characterization of the pandemic from “embers” to “big fires.” It's obvious that the change is driven by one thing and one thing only: The fear of losing the presidency to the presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Going by all the polls conducted on the way he handled the crisis, the most serious since WWII, one can say that the vast majority in the country ae unlikely to re-elect him.

A word about why he and his minions did not invite Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx to the White House briefing. What Mr. Trump announced now was what Dr. Fauci has been telling him and the country all along. Decency would demand that Trump apologize to Fauci for all the mean things he and his minions said about Fauci's assessment of the pandemic. But the whole world knows that apologizing for his blunders is the last thing one can expect form Mr. Trump.

Why was Dr. Birx not present at the briefing? My guess is that she requested to be excused from it. It has been reported that Mr. Trump’s belittling of the coronavirus crisis and his impatience to lift all restrictions imposed in its wake were based on the charts-driven advice Dr. Birx gave him. It seems, to her, telling her boss what he wants to hear is more important than honoring the Hippocratic Oath she took as a medical doctor. She didn't want to embarrass herself standing by his side and watch him discard her advice."
2020-07-22 17:12:38,"Yes, President Know it all.  Just think if you had just a minuscule amount of concern for the health of your loyal voters.  You would have stepped aside and supported medical recommendations as an good example.
But now there are more than 139 thousand dead due to your great concern to be reelection rather than the well being of the population.  Yes we would have lost some,  but your bungling has cost the majority.  Your chances to be elected are not so good, but if you get out of the way your chances might improve."
2020-07-22 17:27:42,His staff of sycophants finally had the courage to tell him if you dont say this to the country you will loose the election.  They had to push him into it.  A transparent play.
2020-07-22 17:44:29,"""Kayleigh McEnany... told reporters that it was not as urgent for the president to wear one since he was tested regularly for the virus"" ignoring the issue of those surrounding him not wearing masks who may have it.  Or that test results can lag.

This administration never misses an opportunity to display their lunacy, stupidity and inconsistency."
2020-07-22 17:45:14,"Tomorrow's headline:

Trump, in a shift, unendorses masks and says virus will get better and that yesterday's NYTimes news article with the title ""Trump, in a Shift, Endorses Masks and Says Virus Will Get Worse"" is fake news."

Gotta hand it to those Ivy Leaguers. They do know all the best words."
2020-07-22 18:53:42,Thank you for covering his 'briefings' and summarizing them.  I can't bear listening to Trump's voice unless he's being ridiculed in a Sarah Cooper video.
2020-07-22 19:59:30,He doesn’t actually believe this in his deluded reality. He’s just saying this because his new campaign manager told him to.
2020-07-22 20:31:53,"It’s one thing to report on this press conference, another to watch it live. Trump was obviously reading off a script he hadn’t bothered to digest. The monotone, the misplaced inflections, the stumbles — even when he shows us he can read he doesn’t know what he is saying. Hence the contradictions between the script and his ‘real world’ pronouncements.  To think this performance represents a shift in his thinking or attitude is ludicrous. Who are you going to believe on that, Trump’s sympathizers or your lying eyes?"
2020-07-22 14:06:03,A pathetic performance.  He has mishandled this whole thing from  the start.  He cares about no one yet then he wishes Ghislaine Maxwell (charged in a pedophile ring) well.  Sad reflection of his character.  This cannot end soon enough.
2020-07-22 21:44:54,"One need to only ask mask-resistant individuals scheduled to have surgery if they would proceed knowing their surgeon would not be wearing a mask? Mr. Trump's political conversion on the issue is as fallacious as his argument was against it. This is the same as his posturing against COVID-19 testing, wherein he absurdly implies increased testing causes the disease and wants it reduced and/or eliminated for the general population. Why if such is the case, have not our elected representatives and/or journalists directly challenged the president on  the hypocrisy of he and Mr. Pence being tested every day? What's good for the goose......."
2020-07-22 22:16:09,"On April 3, when the CDC first advised Americans to wear masks, there were 5784 dead from #Covid_19. There are now more than 144K."
2020-07-21 11:07:00,"Usually crisis accelerate what was already undergoing. This time will be no different. 

Working from home already expanded before the pandemic. Yet it may be efficient a few days per week but if done for a long time it is not sustainable. Unless ... your job is already like a job for amazon mechanical turk. And there are many white collar jobs (not the ones that pays most) which are like this. So these ""middle class"" white collar jobs will go on ""work from home"" mode. Then, the boss will realize he can outsource that, either abroad, or locally and you'll have the ""uber model"" for low end white collar jobs. These people don't get paid enough to live in the city and they live it. It was already undergoing. The top still need social interaction and will get it in the city. In the city will remain the elite and the low end service jobs. So yet a lot of people will leave. 

In the name of ecology we may create parks instead of them. We will have less cars in the street so we will commute faster with electric cars. 

In the name of ""too much tourism"" and ""ecology"" we will make sure going on a trip is expensive so the rich can continue travelling while globally we reduce CO2 emissions. In the end the rift between the city and countryside will become what it was in 19th century europe."
2020-07-21 11:21:11,"IF, the cities can create a more conducive environment where the car is no longer king, where public transport works, quietly, unobtrusively, where green spaces and light are given priority over bland boring towers that casts shadows over the street and surrounding buildings and create an even worse wind-tunnel effect, IF all that can be done, only then will NY-style city living be appealing. IMHO."
2020-07-21 11:22:04,"As I sit in my Manhattan apartment, where I comfortably work from home, I can see the fear, that cities will lose the luster as valid, but then again, I see the opposite as well. Enough people are warning of the losses, the budget constraints, the loss of opportunity, of network effects on innovation, and the hardship on others, so...

- There is an energy in the city, something one couldn't find anywhere else, except in another city. Some people want the energy, the vitality, the possibilities, that urban density can bring. People are social beings.

- I hate crowds, and fewer people vying for a space in Manhattan would mean more space for others, greater freedom to enjoy its architecture, its museums, its parks, and its culture.

- Walking, one of the pleasures of NYC would only become easier, even if more necessary.

The downsides I don't see reported on in the major press:

- Increases in carbon footprints, as people drive even more, as systems are spread out even further.

- Although it is mentioned that NYC might become more equal, it could become worse, as only those that can afford to opt out of failing infrastructure live well, as well as use Manhattan as an asset store, or as a stopover from their other homes."
2020-07-21 11:26:47,"This time will certainly be different. When COID-19 is behind us and the masks settle to the floor, there is a new way to do business. The need for square footage is going to shrink and with that the number of daily commuters into the Downtowns of cities everywhere. Perhaps that is a good thing.
The stress on systems of transit, utilities, water, electricity, etc will lessen. 
We are on the brink of overbuilding, already exceeding environmental standards, Here is the opportunity to relieve that. I have faith in the changes to come."
2020-07-21 11:35:04,"So, what can we hope for?

- A greener more sustainable city with fewer cars

- A healthier city, with less pollution, more walking, more bikes

- Even more singles than before flocking to cities, as a place 
to meet

- Fewer authoritarian police (we can't afford them)

- Density but more tolerable

- More effort put into diversifying away from finance, into tourism, education, and technology

- More money coming back from the Fed, as opposed to us subsidizing red America

- Less inequality"
2020-07-21 11:37:51,"Cities like New York, San Francisco and other high tech hubs will survive the pandemic, but will their landscapes become many pockets of empty office buildings and closed store fronts, not because of the pandemic, but because the reduction of city services like mass transit, police budget cuts and additional debt burdens with tax revenues falling and the potential of even further tax revenues shrinking if more people who commuted into a city to work before the pandemic permanently work from their homes outside the city?

For example, how can the city of New York still collect city income tax from a person who once worked in the city and lives in NJ but now works from their NJ residence and will continue to do so on a permanent basis? There would not be any justification for NYC to do so, since that person is not using any other the city’s services. The city may try to collect these taxes from the person’s employer, but that will be a hard sell.

So as these cities create more open spaces and turn streets into pedestrian only zones and bike only roads for people with enough income or trust funds or other sources of financial means to remain in these cities, the supporting casts (lower wage earners) will have a much more difficult time to continue to work in the city to serve those more financially better off ...."

2020-07-21 11:51:30,"Social changes moves in waves. The first time I went to New York City was 1981. It was a war zone. People told me to ""look down"" and ""avoid eye contact."" People warned me to avoid the side streets for fear of being mugged. Boston was the same; homeless everywhere, fear of crime everywhere. Last time I was in NYC was just before the Pandemic. It was vibrant. It was safe. It was rich. The pendulum is swinging back, and (ironically) the suburbs and the suburban lifestyle are rising from the ashes. Not just with crime but so too with economic activity. Prepare yourselves for the coming bankruptcy or near bankruptcy of America's large Leftist cities who have had it so good for so long they have forgotten what it's like to struggle."

2020-07-21 11:58:44,"The pandemic is pushing society to ask hard questions and to finally capture the full value of the internet.  Why do people have to spend the extraordinary time and money to drive to a large building in a metropolis when one can roll out of bed, recognize the children's existence, and hop on a zoom call. You can walk the dog and get some exercise while on a conference call.  You can also optimize, hopefully your  work space while avoiding your  cubicle neighbor's loud calls and annoying radio.  Cities are unmistakably more productive than smaller cities but can the loss of productivity be made up by more use of internet connectivity and better peace of mind?  It will interesting to see."

I had moved to the inner suburbs from the outer suburbs to be closer to NYC, however when I switched from the train to bus it was about the same commute time 1.5 hrs each way.  I found another office job about 30min west of my home. After a few years we decided to move in 2019 from east of my suburban office to 1 hr west after I was allowed to work from home 4 days a week. We have a larger home, more property and fresh air with less expense. If we ever needed to go into the city, by car its between 1h and 1.5hr drive. So we get the best of both worlds."

Human  mega cities now have populations >20 million and air that is  the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. US cities have 10s of thousands of homeless people and no solution in sight. More is not always better, or at this stage, possible. Human kind has not learned that infinite growth  whether on a planet or a city is not possible or good.

What we are doing is not sustainable. Not in cities or anywhere else. Cities just highlight the best and worst of our “civilization “."
2020-07-21 12:39:26,"Since the NYT sees fit to speculate, let me take out my crystal ball too.  The kinds of people who are attracted to the rhythm and dynamism of major cities will stay.  If you thrive on arts and culture, global cuisine, and a cosmopolitan community of citizens you won't want to settle for suburbia or small town America.  Tourists will continue to flock to cities when it becomes safe.  Students will repopulate urban campuses.  Having said that, the population will probably diminish somewhat.  There's always a contingent of people who move to places like NYC because of a job. They don't hate it but don't really have a special desire to live in a big city.  If the job moves or a better opportunity presents itself they will leave.  Will it be an economic disaster?  I hope not.  It may even rebalance our great cities.  Dare I dream of more affordable housing?  It might even be nice to go to Sunday brunch and not spend 2.5 hours on a wait list."
2020-07-21 12:40:13,"It’s not a surprise that remote working can increase productivity but early data is showing it’s introverts that benefit from quiet and likely driving the total increase. The extroverts are suffering most and zoom is not an end-all-be-all substitute. Modern office design has assumed that jamming crowds of people into big spaces without privacy or quiet is good for all; that it leads to more and better innovation and that special rooms for quiet are enough. Innovation studies show ideas can come from groups but groups are best for improving ideas, especially done with techniques like design thinking and working with consumers and customers. Most ideas  still come from moments of quiet, and from individuals. And that they are sparked by exposure to all kinds of unrelated stimuli. There’s no substitute for the great cities in driving that kind of inspiration. But now we have another technique to add to our options for interaction and provide flexibility. Hurray for that. The best cities with all they offer will still be magnets for people. We will adjust as we always do."

If it takes several years to bounce back, will they have enough time to wait it out? How will they survive in the meantime?"
2020-07-21 12:49:43,"I like the vision put forward at the end of this article.  Many of us have been complaining for years about rents rocketing in Manhattan and elsewhere, the our city being taken over by exclusive stores, luxury skyscrapers and becoming too expensive, overcrowded and unlivable.  This may be our best opportunity to escape that.  

And I agree with another commenter who wrote that young people of talent and energy will still want to come here, and perhaps all the more as the rents drop and the city becomes cheaper.  The universities, schools, museums, cultural centers will/are likely to remain here.  

We are much, much more than a center of commerce and wealth.  Our great city (maybe the greatest city the world has ever seen) will bounce back, and maybe be better than before, veering off a trend line that was threatening to strangle it."

In the medium to long term it makes no sense. Why would anyone want to work remotely from NJ when you can do the same from ... i don't know a variety of places with lower COL, higher QOL and no/lower taxes? More importantly, why would any *employer* want to maintain such a status quo? If they are not having the benefit of having their workers in the offcie available for in-person interactions, may as well locate them in Nashville or Ashville or any other -Ville and pay them 30% less? 

If anything, this covid crisis in the long-run spells more doom and gloom for expensive suburbs of expensive cities, and a promise of more influx to small, livable towns with character and some sense of community. Oh. And NYC will always be in the league of its own. It is the only european-like city in the U.S. and will always attract certain people.

Of course, living in cities has its advantages, and especially if rents were cheaper it would be even more favourable to live there.  Even if lawyers and so on decided to move to the suburbs, it would create a sort of ""5-star ghetto"".

This will have enormous negative consequences not just for restaurant-glutted cities like New York and San Francisco but also for smaller ""comeback"" cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. In these places, restaurants are the urban pioneers that renew blighted neighborhoods and revitalize downtowns. They give employment to struggling artists, students and entrepreneurs. They encourage empty-nesters to downsize from suburban upkeep and engage with the more culturally varied urban core. They provide after-work networking hubs and settings for special celebrations. They are prime tourist attractions. They are the glue that pulls together disparate parts of the metropolitan community. As a distinguished urbanologist once said to me, ""As restaurants go, so goes the city."""
2020-07-21 13:05:58,"I’m curious about the idea that with increasing WFH people will want to move away from cities. 

People may want to move away from expensive places, but with more WFH your lifestyle is even more isolated. How are you supposed to meet people and make friends? The density of cities helps even more and makes them even more attractive with increasing WFH. 

The problem in the US is that cities are more expensive to live in, even if they should, by all rights, be cheaper, since so many costs are reduced and shared. 

And the simple reason behind this is that being the economic powerhouses of the country, cities have been subsidizing the rest of the country by actually paying their way, sending money to rural areas directly, sending money to the rural poor, sending money to build rural infrastructure. 

The only area that makes city more expensive is property costs, but if WFH is the future, that opens up drastically more space for housing people making apartment costs cheaper. 

It’s about time cities recognize that they are inherently cheaper than non cities, and start building upon those strengths by demanding equality in terms of tax and other treatment."
2020-07-21 13:06:29,"""Supporting the urban lifestyle"" sounds like you get to do lots of fun things with the big money you make. But the reality in New York is that you are paying $5,000 in monthly rent (even these ""rich"" workers have no prayer of buying their own place unless they get outside help) and $50,000 per child for private school. And for the 10% income tax rate and 9% sales tax, you get a crumbling infrastructure that is about to get worse. 

Many of these cities are for the truly and independently wealthy. For everyone else, there are other options."

I am afraid that my new home will be overrun with escapees. 
That said, I think a large segment of people love city life and would hate it here."
2020-07-21 13:16:36,"Have been amazed how my suburban office park 30-40 min outside of Boston has been at maybe 30 percent capacity.  It begs the question of how many office/knowledge workers really need to work in person?  With hours of wasted commute times and especially those that work in dense urban cores and prefer to live outside the city. 

I live and work outside Boston about 30-40 minutes commute.  My laboratory has been deemed essential and have been working at our company in person for the entire pandemic.  Our area has been severely impacted although the number of covid 19 cases have been drastically reduced recently.  The local suburban office park has been maybe 40 percent capacity.  Will it make sense for companies to really spend so much on real estate and offices after the pandemic especially those in the most expensive real estate markets like Cambridge and Boston.  

One problem though with be the availability of housing outside the city.  Building restrictions do not allow for massive building projects at least in the greater Boston area.  

I do think there will be a rethink as to how essential it will be to be in the most expensive and dense areas to be successful as a business.  I have always been amazed at the real estate prices in Boston/Cambridge and amount of commute time wasted by workers to get to those jobs for those that do not wish to live in the most dense and expensive places.  Living and working on top of you neighbor should be a choice not an obligation."

Unlike in Europe, where it's easy to get around cities on well-developed and maintained systems of public transportation, here it's a misery. 

Besides, how interesting are cities anymore? Chain stores dominate them, and you can find the same businesses in places that are easier to get to. As for restaurants, sure, there are (were?) more of those, but is the occasional meal in an interesting restaurant worth budget-breaking rents and punishing daily commutes?"

2020-07-21 13:29:10,"One key problem with working from home and moving out of cities:  property taxes in suburban and rural areas are often much higher than taxes in urban areas.  And the opportunities for kids are much diminished.

When my kids were born, we moved to a suburb because the housing was cheaper.  When the kids became school aged, we moved right back to the city.

By moving back to the city, our property taxes were cut in half and our kids were going to much better funded schools. The diversity and transportation benefits were important too.

I agree with the basic tenet of the this argument. Certainly the observation that ""New York was turning into a paradise for the rich"" is correct. But I remain concerned that a MESSIER city may not be all that good news. Without enough tax and rental revenues from those big corporations, the city may face huge financially challenges. The line between messiness and decaying  is thin."
2020-07-21 13:08:34,"A lot of the problems dense urban cities are facing with covid both economically and with the virus itself are being manifested in smaller cities just as dramatically, and they have much less leverage to attain resources to recover. When this is all over, I think the distribution of which urban areas are desirable may change some, but the desirability of urban areas generally will probably not change much. Everyone I know who’s working remotely seems pretty over it.

I understood this narrative when it was mainly New York and Milan facing disaster and the suburbs seemed like an escape, but it’s everywhere now and the link between density and infection has been falling apart. 

The suburbs don’t seem like an escape anymore. And for me, a move to the suburbs would mean getting a car. Any cost savings would be more than wiped out by all the expenses that go along with that."

Urban parks are not a good substitute. As people realize they are not forced by circumstances to endure urban living conditions simply to earn a good living they will trickle out into less crowded more livable communities. Businesses will benefit as they realize they can cut costs dramatically when they limit the amount of real estate needed and be able to pay far lower wages because employees will not be forced into paying exorbitantly inflated rents for minimal housing. A decreased tax base will further limit services making city living even less desirable.
2020-07-21 13:57:02,"The pandemic was the third strike - strikes #1 and #2 were the nationwide roll-out of superfast internet and the SALT tax limitation that took effect January 1, 2018.  The top 10% pay over 70% of all Federal income tax, plus the lion's share of state and local tax in high tax 'blue' states (most notably: CT, NY, MA, IL, NJ and CA).  Now that the pandemic has proven to these workers and their employers, that WFH is effective (courtesy of superfast internet), there is no incentive to WFH in a high tax location.  Indeed, there is an enormous financial incentive for this group to migrate to states and localities that do not impose (largely nondeductible) state and local income taxes, and that have small local government footprints (so no need to resort to high property taxes).  The higher earners will in fact migrate, in droves; they will have no financial alternative.  Affected blue states, with enormous local government infrastructure and immense  municipal workforces and pension obligations, will try and drive the tax burdens lower and lower down the income scale, triggering further taxpayer flight.  The future of NY, Chicago, Boston, LA, San Francisco etc. is Detroit (i.e. depopulation followed by default).  Just a question of which city gets there first."
2020-07-21 14:00:26,"Interesting article, but it misses completely the long term trend toward density as a mitigant for global warming. While remote work might alleviate the need for commuting daily, people are not going to simply sit in their homes living their lives online. The net result will be more cars, more sprawl, and a greater share of the population living in free-standing, energy intensive structures - in effect a return to the postwar dream which, while not the sole factor, certainly has contributed substantially to the climate crisis."
2020-07-21 14:01:32,"I think people will still find cities attractive - but there may very well be a shift in the way space is allocated.  Condos might get bigger to include dedicated work spaces.  They may be more expensive as a result, but this would correspond with less square footage allocated to dedicated office space.  And employers could reallocate money currently spent renting dedicated spaces to providing employees with an office space subsidy.  The point is that city life is still terrific - it just would be a lot better without all the commuting."

Trump is not occupying cities or declaring war on Americans; he is sending a few hundred federal  personnel to restore order in cities where state and local authorities are not able—or willing—to quell the violence, arson, looting, etc., and provide a safe environment for residents, visitors and businesses.

By the way, I am a lifelong Democratic and am working to ensure Trump is not elected in November. However, with all these idiotic governors and mayors who think law and order are not necessary components of modern life, I think we are at some risk of seeing a second term for you-know-who."

We've had no actual antitrust enforcement in the United States for years, and this is the logical outcome. Everyone now wants the one in a million chance to be the next ""unicorn"" that will make a billion dollars in six months, driving out the competition and using open anti-competitive measures to do so. Everyone else will get to work for these potential ""unicorns"". 

In the 1980s, the predictions were that high-technology would make the world ""placeless"" - we would have computer programmers living in Lincoln, Nebraska working for Microsoft in Washington. This prediction didn't take into account the ""winner-take-all""/anti-competitive industrial infrastructure the U.S. was moving toward.

I think of European cities occupied and/or often practically destroyed during World War II: London, Paris, Rome, Prague and many more. Every one of them survived incredible hardship, major humanitarian and cultural crises, for years. They suffered for much longer than we will probably have to. And every one of them rebounded, such was the hunger to return to civilization.  Major structures were rebuilt, the arts came back, people strolled, ate and relaxed outside, and life went on.  And we’ll come back too."
2020-07-21 14:14:57,"It seems unlikely that cities like New York will fully recover to the glory they enjoyed in the recent past.

Today, there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a vaccine, though this is far from certain. If there is a vaccine, the current restrictions can end. But the risk of another pandemic will still be there - the root causes, such as widespread air travel and global overpopulation still exist, and the risks of disease in densely populated cities will still be with us.

Urban crime will be a much more dominant concern. In most large cities recent protests degenerated into rioting, and the progressive response has been to defund law enforcement.  While this will please some, it is persuading many to leave large cities for safer suburbs and smaller, and safer, urban areas.

The costs of urban living, already high, is increasing dramatically. This is due to taxation and regulation, and the costs of population density. The overall cost of living in NYC is dramatically higher than in most smaller cities. It often takes longer to travel short distances in NYC than to drive between cities in the midwest.

During the pandemic, we have learned how to interact and work remotely. In many ways this is not the same as the interactions possible in cities, but in other ways it is better.  Not having to commute is a great time saver.

Megacities like New York will continue, but they will not grow as they once did, and indeed it is likely that smaller, more livable towns will thrive."

Naturally we think that things will get worse; in this instance (again), cities will decline as we adjust to working remotely and congregating less.  But this bucks history and our nature to congregate, build, restore and socialize.  So, we’ll go through a time of urban flight (did that) and disinvestment (did that), but countervailing forces - including the inherent inefficiencies of low density living and carbon intensity of transportation systems - will push us back to cities.

Where distance education shines is in higher ed for non traditional working students —which is the new majority of higher ed students.

It’s rural, semi-urban life that needs rejuvenation—and perhaps now has some greater chance, some hope.  After the second world war some of the most striking descriptions of the environment of Germany and other devastated countries concerned the utter destruction of cities and the relative vibrancy and liveliness of rural areas.

Funny thing, our great cities compared to global mega-cities are sort of modest in size. Nonetheless, it is time to reboot, recapitalize and modernize their operations. You are right, New York was staring at a dead end. It was becoming an amusement park for the wealthy and tourists. It was pricing out its own citizens from its housing, theater, zoos, restaurants, gardens, museums, etc. It’s time to rethink and reorganize its transit, roads and highways, schools, housing, policing, healthcare, cultural and governmental services, etc. in a more comprehensive, fairer and responsive manner. Our politicians talk a lot about equity but they have not created a pathway to achieve this goal. A massive open-ended comprehensive public brainstorming exercise is required. I would suggest that it be spearheaded by the Public Advocates office with a mandate to develop a blueprint for change based on facilitated community inputs (I’ve been impressed with EDC’s community outreach and this could be a model) and be put to the voters as the policy makers for a change."

No one who cares about their career ""casually chats"" about their high-tech work with outsiders in a face-to-face chat. Such conversations can happen at a  university, 
but there are lots of  universities. Protecting intellectual property is simply  a much bigger priority than alleged ""creative exchanges"".

We do not need ""superstar"" cities. There are many cities big enough to have what desirable employees want - an airport, big hospitals, good schools, universities and entertainment such as sports, parks, zoos, museums,  etc. As a society, giving a few cities a quasi-monopoly will only limit national cohesion, introduce risk and hurt competitiveness.

The country  is not ""full"" despite what the so-called president claims. Our future success  will depend on successfully assimilating far more immigrants than we do now or that any enthically-defined country ever could. Cramming as much of our economy and population into a handful of cities has almost no chance to scale well enough to get us where we need to go to lead the next century."
2020-07-21 14:39:49,"This will be bad news for the urban poor. While gentrification and higher rents have been hurtful, the taxes and jobs lost if these people decamp will put many of these cities back in the 1970s and 1980s. Local income and property taxes help fund schools and services that benefit the low income. 

The loss of transit jobs, restaurant, parking attendants, security and others hurt working class people if no alternative is created. 

Worse yet, it will recreate that (white suburb) (poor black city) dynamic that led to many of the problems we deal with today. 

Finally, if rural and ex-urban America is to be the new place of commerce, they need to make themselves more welcoming to the immigrant (Asian and Indian) skilled professionals that will have to move there."
2020-07-21 14:38:00,"I really hope this will push out the people who were subarbanizing NY with their affinity for chains and super sterile establishments 

This will make people who never wanted to be in a big city leave while making the city affordable for people who love global cuisine, cultures, diversity, nightlife, public transit, happenstance encounter, random hook ups etc 

This is win win. Such folks can leave as weren’t happy here anyways and attract more people that make NY amazing and will only make it even more dynamic and stop the descent into banality by all these folks who never wanted to be here. 

Great opportunity for everyone. We must avail it to rethink affordability and cultural offerings and mass transit/walkability"

2020-07-21 14:40:08,"Another great piece from Porter.

A big chunk of stimulation for techonological, scientific and other areas of innovation comes and has almost always come from ""close"" physical social interaction, collaboration and dialogue, whether in a garage, a college dorm, a lab or a classroom. Developing the very cure for this current pandemic is an example. 
Those environments flourish best not in zoom meetings or when we are all scattered in a suburb.  
With some exceptions, we are probably more likely to have an Eureka moment while interacting with other peers in person, than with your significant other or your kids discussing chores and dinner options in the next room or right behind you.  
Cities will eventually rise back, and if post-pandemic they do not in the US, the urban appeal will drag people and their talent to other megalopolis like Seoul or Berlin, or London or Mexico City."
2020-07-21 13:43:43,"Rather than a declaration in a photo caption, I’d like to see the source of the data that proves NYC Metro (pop. 18 million) is a bigger economy in output than Australia (25 million) or Spain (47 million)."
2020-07-21 14:47:40,"I live in the Mission District, in San Francisco, and few places are on the market, but those that are are going for over asking price. Maybe what will happen is that people will flock to cities and move to enclaves, like Bend, Oregon, and Vail, Colorado, rendering the far-away suburbs less desirable."
2020-07-21 14:48:18,"Wrong. Cities have found that technology can indeed allow enterprises to function generally well. But they haven't ""replicated"" their pre pandemic performance. They are not thriving, they are surviving. Only fully functioning cities will guarantee high performance."
2020-07-21 15:03:45,I spent my single years (from the mid 80s to the mid 90s) in NYC and Boston. NYC wasn't a great fit for me; Boston was. Kids are now off to college and we are ready to return to the city. But the city we left is less desirable in many ways. Expensive and increasingly sterile (the Seaport is truly anyplace USA). We are trying to figure out where we will land next. It will need to have some level of affordability and culture. Hard to find that anymore in the US.
2020-07-21 15:05:57,"They say the four most dangerous words on Wall Street are ""This time it's different.""   What we have here is just another serving of the same idea, and it will prove just as wrong.

Working at home is nowhere near a substitute for the chance encounters at work, with former coworkers, with friends who have a friend with them that might lead to something.  

"" Over one-half of large businesses and over one-third of small ones didn’t detect any productivity loss. "" was good for a chuckle.  Who really expected things to fall apart in three or four months?  For now people just keep on doing what they were doing before, projects can be tweaked and variants on the older ones launched.

The role of cities in boosting business doesn't play out in a time period measured in months, it's the long-term accumulation of small improvements and of meetings leading to new ideas and businesses.  Pausing it for a few months is not the same as doing away with it forever."
2020-07-21 15:06:15,"""Moreover, the researchers found that about four in 10 companies expect that 40 percent of their employees who switched to remote work during the pandemic will keep doing so after the crisis, at least in part.""

That little phrase at the end - ""at least in part"" - is huge. Working remote ""in part"" essentially does nothing in terms of allowing the employee to live somewhere cheaper. If I have to go into my company in Manhattan every other week, I'm not going to move more than a couple hours from the city. And at that point the COL isn't so much lower that the company can in good faith lower salaries."
2020-07-21 15:07:13,"Medieval cities survived the Bubonic Plagues that killed half or more of their populations.

2020-07-21 15:09:06,"Are those per capita incomes for the major metro areas means or medians?  If the former then it’s not great news that cities produce lots of little oligarchs.
And how do those incomes look when adjusted for local cost of living indices?  One of the reasons people live elsewhere than in coastal cities is because they have far more disposable income, and can have a higher standard of living.
Those who practice the ‘dismal science’ often lose sight of the whole purpose of human society (improving the quality of life for everyone) in their excitement over performance of their preferred metrics (eg GDP).  These are not the same thing."
2020-07-21 15:10:39,"Last week, we moved to North Carolina after 10+ years in NYC. We won’t save much money, but our house is huge, there is a ton of access to nature, and I couldn’t be more excited to vote here. Our 20 year old daughter stayed behind in Manhattan, as the math was different to her: even though classes will be all online, she’s happy to bike everywhere and enjoy masked walks and picnics with friends. (I’m curious how that math works when the weather turns cold and dreary.) I think we’ll go back to NYC someday, but the number one thing that pushed me out was the noise—the pandemic merely accelerated the move. We’re calling the move a “pandemic experiment” — giving it a few years to see if we like it or not. TBD, I guess."
2020-07-21 15:13:08,"I miss gritty NYC, or so I argued over the last 20 years. Looks like it's coming back. Now that that's real, I'm equal parts excited and worried. But I'll never leave. I'll ride out whatever comes next. This is my home."
2020-07-21 15:17:26,I find this claim odd in the day and age of the Internet where information is available 7x24 and at your command. Especially now that basically ALL of the white collar corporate world is basically working remotely (including most of Silicon Valley).

  I shall return, Seattle. I dream about you often, daydreams and the very realistic nighttime, sleeping versions.
   Stay strong."
2020-07-21 15:20:43,"Of course cities will thrive again. None of the pre-Covid dynamics have changed, and the vaccines are coming. 
The main reason why working from home proved so effective is that teams went in with fully functional relationships, in person and sometimes developed over several years.
Working from home will surely happen more, but don’t expect to be able to do your job from just anywhere unless it’s only about producing documents or code. 
In fact, when it’s safe again to go to ball games and concerts, expect cities to be alive like never before."
2020-07-21 15:21:40,"We are living in very fluid, but consequential  times.  Nothing will ever be the same as it was and none of us have any say in what transpires along this journey.  Our world even before this pandemic was changing right before our eyes...dramatically in an individuals own lifetime.  I feel that this pandemic is a test for our planet.  How quickly we react to upcoming and massive changes in our planet will determine not only how cities survive, but how humanity and civilization survive.  Think about this next decade as being the most important in our recorded history."
2020-07-21 15:23:15,This dynamic now in operation may serve to further aggrandize the status of America as an elitist nation. Much to consider about how it may all shake out to stay once the pandemic is over. Could it be...? Many of those in the traditional office environment professions and in tech will be afforded a new freedom of mobility allowing them to live in areas that please them rather than accommodate job necessity. Urban areas will have more and more transitioned into residential areas for low wage workers/service workers and those whose jobs require face to face interaction. Urban centers may still serve as prime spots for entertainment and cultural life but those taking advantage of these offerings will be commuting in from outside the city boundaries. A future America where those that live in big cities are in greater proportion the population of America’s have nots.
2020-07-21 15:30:51,"Last year, the Times had an article on the nation's struggling middle section and what to do about it.  Comments from residents of ""superstar"" cities sported a dismissive and cavalier attitude. Many repeated the same sentiment, ""Why should I care?"" 

Well, flash forward to the pandemic period and, while tables haven't yet turned, some reversal of fortune looks eminent, as though--based on this article--that would be a bad thing. Yes, New York's economy is larger than some nations, but that's because it's the banking & commercial center that administrates and profits from the productivity of the rest of the nation. 

The U.S. economy has always been symbiotic though our ""superstar"" cities often forget that. Agriculture, mining, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and countless other industries from around the USA feed the maw of major city economies.  At the same time, American consumers embrace the brands and technology from those cities. 

So, don't exaggerate sharing the whole nation's wealth with the rest of us as your demise. Out here in the places that don't count, we have struggling cities, towns and rural stretches with opportunity to spare.  All of these are places deserving of a piece of the pie to which we contribute. 

I won't echo the sentiments aimed at us last year. I do care what happens to NYC, San Francisco, et al. But there’s plenty to go around because its creation comes from all around. I am surprised by how self-proclaimed liberal cities forget that."
2020-07-21 15:32:20,"Here in the Bay Area (unlike New York), rents are not lower. Luxury lofts are still going up. Vacancy is a word that doesn’t not yet seem to exist for housing in Oakland. As for the end of cities, I’m just not seeing it."
2020-07-21 15:33:03,"The pandemic is a temporary phenomenon, and will not have a lasting impact on agglomeration of educated professionals. Young, educated people want to be in cities. They want to raise their children in cities (or, at the least, major metropolitan areas). And permanent remote work isn't practical for the vast majority of professions.

Once there's a vaccine, pre-Covid preferences will resume. It isn't like people no longer value eating out, culture or social interaction. As we saw after 9-11, the Great Recession, and other ""game changers"", nothing actually changed once the crisis passed."
2020-07-21 15:34:45,"Why do so many people and articles like this assume that this is a permanent state of affairs? It's hard to believe that, toward the end of this year, theaters, museums, bars, etc. won't be reopening. Besides living in New York is more than amenities. Every time I take my dogs for a walk here, it's full of interesting things to look at and interesting (good and bad, but interesting!) interactions. When was recently visiting my mother in a mid-sized Florida city, when I took long walks, it just felt dead and deadening."
2020-07-21 15:54:36,"I remember in the 1990s a story about lifestyle coveted Boulder, Colorado where one secretary there said you need a master's degreed just to get a job as an administrative assistant in Boulder.  Point being that people will do anything to live in Boulder.

I live in Boston, the Silicon Valley of Biotech, and what I have noticed is in the last 20 years here is that the best and brightest biotech minds from all over the world want to come to Boston to work in this environment.  Not live, like in Boulder, but instead in Boston they come to work, and work, and work.  I have noticed this in the other 10 tech cities as well, and I do not believe the pandemic will change this dynamic,

Yes, life will change for us in these high tech cities, but many of us are here to work first, and live, second, and I do not see our bio-scientists who are working for biotech start ups or pharmacuetical firms while collaborating with Harvard or MIT scientists on research leaving Boston anytime soon...pandemic or no pandemic.  No offense intended, but this work will not be outsourced to Salina, Kansas for example to get lower labor costs and lower rent."

These are going to take time, they will take both social and familial sacrifices and adjustments, are we, as a populace willing to change our habits in order to return to some form of semblance of what once was, this will need reflection."
2020-07-21 15:57:37,"The current government of NYC is openly hostile to capital and investment.  The changes to rent stabilization eliminated all incentive to invest in and improve multifamily properties, especially for smaller landlords.

On the upside, Seattle, at least for a while, will not have thousands of cars pouring in every day, cluttering up the streets, adding immeasurably to air pollution.  Seattle has seen these ups and downs in its real estate cycle.  We have gone through periods of empty towers, although in the 2007-2008 crisis these were mostly residential towers.

""By shifting to remote work, 'they can dramatically widen their labor pool and evade the labor-wage trap that they are in.'""

This is code for: Companies can pay you less. So for all of those who think working from home is the greatest thing since the wheel, beware; you will eventually make less money. Also, since you're not really a human being anymore, but a face on a zoomcall, you will also be more disposable, and at last, what a great way for the bigwigs to make even more money than not only paying YOU less, but they don't even have to pay for office space anymore. Since they can use yours for free. 

And as for all of those who have left New York to greener pastures in the country, buh-bye. You're obviously not a real New Yorker. Which is okay.

My guess though is you are going to need the cities to remain dominant for those who seek better career fortunes.

When working from home, it’s hard to expand your network, it’s hard to see what others are doing and what other kind of role you’ll do better at and be compensated higher.  It’s hard to evaluate how well you’re performing relative others in the same job.  Additionally it’s harder to make yourself standout with regard to merit.  How else will younger workers be trained in a variety of industries as well as learn soft skills that come with working on a team?

For these reasons, cities as hubs of employment will lways be needed.  Unless everyone is fine with their role, salary, and responsibilities that they’re content working in their own bubble til retirement, my guess is the lure of advancement will bring people back."

2020-07-21 16:16:45,"I believe the article leaves out one important fact:  While a city like NYC offers a great deal, has a large number of positives, it also has a huge number of negatives.  When disaster strikes, it usually hits NYC, isn't far off the mark.  The 3 major disasters of this century centered in NYC (9-11, the great recession, covid) -- so if given a choice of having to live in NYC to be close to your crowded office, being forced to use mass transit (regardless of CV-19 when I worked in NYC I caught a cold or flu twice a year like clockwork), living in cramped space -- OR -- moving deep into upstate NY, CT NJ or Pennslyvania where you can occasionally commute in for fun or profit, but can work at home whenever you want -- good schools, good restaurants, good open spaces -- vs  -- not only the crush of humanity but when riots hit and crime goes up -- where are people going to choose to live?  

Let's face it, NYC is overrated.  Sure, musical theater was great back in the day -- but now what do you have -- musicals crafted from pop songs that aren't very good (Abba?  seriously?), restaurants that are so so.  I've lived in cities far away from NY and you can find a great restaurants in lots of localities -- but try to find real BBQ or Tex-Mex in NYC.  I once ordered a chicken fried steak in a downtown restaurant that claimed to serve southern cuisine.  It came with no cream gravy.  An insult, sir.  And yes, Carnegie Hall is great, but there are great symphonies everywhere."

2020-07-21 16:29:08,"Here are some other questions. Will droves of city-dwellers rediscover the discreet charm of the shopping mall, big-box retail and other hallmarks of American monoculture? Will young Americans in great numbers reverse the decades-long trend of urbanization due to a singular event whose effects are now nationally distributed? With literally trillions of dollars at stake, will the real estate ownership class and their political allies helplessly and idly watch this imagined exodus occur? Will legions of urbanites discover a newfound tolerance for the political and racial attitudes of their new suburban neighbors?"
2020-07-21 16:35:03,"Fascinating article. Yes, we are seeing dramatic changes to the city right now. Vacancy rates are starting to go up, and monthly rents have got to be trending down as a result. The value of living in the city goes way down if you can work from anywhere and if so many of the amenities you enjoy—restaurants, bars, performing arts spaces, and museums—are shut down. I have lived for years in the suburban-feeling (read: “boring”) west side of town, and it has seemed to be moving towards less boring for the past few years—because, relatively speaking, it became one of the more affordable areas in San Francisco —so: more students, young people, families with young children, and the businesses that cater to them. Covid-19 has accelerated the attraction of this quiet, foggy area because of its proximity to the ocean and Golden Gate Park—places where you can be outside, walk, run, bicycle, or safely congregate* (*in small groups, socially distanced, etc.).

On another point, I read here the specious statement we keep hearing this summer, that “remote education has proved inferior”—usually to justify sending teachers and students back into classrooms. As a former teacher who just retired from a field that prays the watchword “data”, I have not seen any studies or references to support the claim."

It’s not urban/suburban/rural, it’s just smaller city life. 

They have the some benefits of cultural/culinary/social life of larger cities, but are relatively affordable. While they rely less on public transportation, they are small, and the cities operate as very dense suburbs - where you can bike or often walk to work. 

Buffalo/Cleveland/Pittsburgh/etc., have jobs and other opportunities, while maintaining a higher and more affordable quality of life than SF/NYC."

The Bay Area and New York may in fact be the driving economic places with all these patents, tech, financial services, and highly educated people.  What they are not compared to fifty years ago is power spots that are sharing things that cannot be measured by micoeconomics.   Artists and most creative people who are in traditional fields cannot afford to live there.  A place like Greenwich Village as we knew it cannot exist in these places.   Our future is not just on how many apps we can patent or the fact that we have doubled the size of financial services over the last 40 years.
At a point, the only reason for many to go to someplace like New York it for financial reasons in this current state of affairs.  Many actual human beings have no place in them or even want to visit."

Unfortunate for those who wish to downsize in their own communities, there is nowhere to go. For those fleeing NYC, there are now few choices. It’s crazy.

Our local school reportedly has 34 new families enrolled this fall. The multitude of well-known private schools are full. These are small schools with nowhere to expand...and they won’t.

Our new residents are all New Yorkers. They are not going back...financial folks, lawyers, musicians, restaurateurs,techies, bankers, teachers, nurses...you name it. The quality of life here is high with many cultural/sports/outdoor options in the area. Our kids are safe....

We saw this after 9-11. Many, many people relocating from the city. 

I doubt many of these people will return to NYC...many are able to work from home. And reverse commute if need be.

Metro North is 20 minutes away. Two hours from the city with none of the hassles. Good schools, lower taxes, lots of philanthropic activities and peace of mind.

When we are forced to return to our offices on Park Avenue in Midtown East we will commute in as little as possible from somewhere north of the city in our own car. Rents will never be allowed to fall if the landlords have anything to say about it, and the rents being too high is only one piece of the horrible economic puzzle for lower and middle income folks trying to make a sustainable life in NYC. Owning decent property is woefully out of reach for most of us. The public schools are poor quality. The MTA is a death trap. The list goes on and on. Somehow having fewer affluent people and less tax receipts is going to make things better? Very suspect thinking in my view. Hey, maybe all these superstar businesses you speak of should pay a little bit more in taxes to help make our cities the best in the world? I for one won’t be holding my breath and am sending you all my best wishes from the woods. If NYC produces as much economically as Spain does then why does NYC compare so unfavorably to Madrid or Barcelona in terms of sustainable quality of life, for instance ?

Also working from home will increase the gig economy where benefits are not provided.

I was required to work at home before the pandemic because my multinational corporation did not have an office in the city where I  lived. It was before the popularity and proliferation of Zoom meetings and teleconferences. I hated it. I hated being alone in my small apartment. I hated not being able to collaborate with my colleagues face to face. I hated not being able to go out with many of them who had become friends for drinks after work to laugh, cry and gossip. I hated having to discipline my naturally undisciplined self to work for eight hours without breaking up the day for lunch with clients. 
There were a few good benefits like the luxury of not having to get up early, putting on anything but sweats and having a superclean apartment from all my days of procrastination and distraction. I hated working during that year and resigned. I can't imagine having to learn to love working at home post Covid.

The effect on wages paid by city based employers could be dramatic (decline) due to work-from-home 1-3 days per week driving more people into lower cost, non-city living areas. This would translate directly into real estate values declining over long periods in cities and the opposite in other areas. The effect on municipal revenues could be huge, causing a further decline in city attractiveness.

The article doesn't mention the fundamental, underlying causes for the shift, which are advances in network capacity and computer processing speed.

The latter are people who only want to live in the city for a bit before they decamp to the suburbs where they can regale their neighbors and kids with tales of once living in the city. 
The more recent extreme abundance of money has made the transient ones stick around a bit longer than in previous times. They’ve staved off the push toward the suburbs with palatial apartments and helicopters to the beach. But make no mistake, they’re only here because of inertia and because they’ve managed to shut most of the city out. Just look at the malls that have followed them here. They don’t enjoy traversing the city in search of goods like the rest of us. They want it all in one place, with people who look like them, like in suburbia. Not surprisingly, the minute their comfy life is compromised, they split. 
Everyone worries that the departure of the transient ones heralds the death of the city but the truth is they they were never really “of the city” to begin with and they will be replaced by the next wave of transient ones. This is just a much-needed rebalancing and a de-suburbanization of the city: fewer cars, fewer malls, less of the obnoxious excess. And I, for one, am just fine with that."

2020-07-21 22:59:45,"In the short term -- reduced demand for both urban office space and apartments will of course occur.  NYC was in the midsts of an over-building frenzy -- particularly in the Manhattan, LIC and Greenpoint codo markets.

This short-term negative impact  will stress some building owners -- particularly the highly-leveraged and require a considerable level of real estate workouts.  Fortunately, with historically low interest rates many such workouts will be successful via refi's that will reduce cash flow demands for debt repayment both by lower interest rates and lengthened maturities.

This will thus enable building owners to reduce rents on vacant space.  That, in turn, will attract both existing and new tenants to occupy that space.

In other words, the market will adjust and over time the current glut of vacant space will be reduced.

As to NYC specifically.  Expect to see a continuation and probable acceleration of the shift in office space usage from finance to tech.  Already, in the pre-Covid era tech companies were becoming major office tenants as financial firms reduced their footprints.

In the end, the City will not die.  It will be disrupted and then realign and adjust to a new reality.

Its streets are grossly congested, as is its public transportation, its parks overrun with people, restaurants crowded and jammed with tables on top of one another, its grocery store experience disheartening...try waiting in line for a half hour just to get into Whole Foods or Trader Joe's...the waterfront, except for small spots here and there, inaccessible.

From Wired regarding the four largest Chinese hacks:

""The OPM breach exposed the personnel records of effectively every civilian employee of the US government, some 21 million people; they included not just key identifiers like names and Social Security numbers but also the comprehensive forms known as SF-86s, which are used in the process of granting employees security clearance and can contain all manner of sensitive information, from drug use and debts to foreign travel. Anthem reported that nearly 80 million people had their insurance information stolen. Marriott’s final accounting of the intrusion into its Starwood subsidiary ended up just shy of 400 million individual records stolen, including as many as 5 million passport numbers. Equifax saw the theft of personal identifiable information regarding 147 million people—effectively the entire adult population of the United States—including drivers’ license numbers of at least 10 million of them.""

Not to mention they stole plans to the F-35 fighter, THAAD missile defense system, Patriot missile, Global Hawk drone, Black Hawk Helicopter, Littoral Combat Ship, W-88 thermonuclear warhead, etc. 

The fact that we let China do this is deplorable."

We should welcome China and help them steal....take stuff, as they will mass produce the vaccine and first try it on their rather helpless populace. That would be the best way to test for safety and efficiency of any vaccine. Then please let's find a way to produce the same right here in the US so we can have a vaccine that is now proven. If the vaccine does not confer immunity or worse have side effects, we just need to read the tea leaves across the ocean to know it's a bad investment. The same for Russia. I say let folks take data.

I won't defend China's actions, but isn't it time we stop playing domestic politics with other nations?

So it appears that American taxpayers are being asked to fund vaccine research where much is uncertain other than pharma's profits. We no doubt will also be responsible for any production, distribution and administration costs, but will have no recourse if such vaccines prove to be toxic. With this story we see that under the Trump kleptocracy, profits are more important than international efforts to promote herd immunity through vaccines, as the Justice Department uses even more tax proceeds to defend pharma, further destroy relations with the world's 2nd largest economy, and indirectly work against American's health should China develop effective vaccines and choose not to allocate them to the U.S."

Of course proof of US intelligence operations is exceedingly difficult to obtain."
2020-07-21 21:44:50,"While it is tempting to criticize every move that Trump administration makes by giving one or the other reason, we should not forget that this hacking is a part of years of behavior by Communist China to steal our technology and then based on that develop their own and profit from it. This time it’s vaccine, before that it was computers, defense, microchips, semiconductors, space research, and the list etc. we may criticize the administration by claiming that Vaccine development should not be secretive or something like that but we should remember that our appeasement emboldens China to grab more territory, enslave and dominate more people in Asia, capture more markets and drive more American workers out of jobs. While some blame of enriching and emboldening Chinese communist dictatorship lies with our leaders and corporations, We too are guilty as being buyers and consumers of such products. Like drugs, cheap products is a demand driven market and as consumers we are responsible for driving manufacturing jobs out of the US and to countries like China.

If China were advancing on a successful coronavirus vaccine, why would they need to steal the product of research in foreign countries? 

So, either this story is not true... or it is true, revealing China is desperate and has little confidence in a domestic breakthrough... or thieves have misread the tea leaves and may steal others’ work and then find Chinese officials don’t need it or want to buy it.

For a nation committed to moving to the very top of the world order, not a good look for China no matter how it shakes out."

Four years later, after a Trade war (that I support) and sanctions, China has lost and will lose trillions of dollars. Companies are relocating. Japan is paying its companies to leave China.

China has learned from the Russians. It's cheaper to use some hackers and deny any involvement later. 

Since Republicans have turned foreign adversary hacking into a partisan issue to help Trump, how would they be reacting to a Chinese attack that favors a Democrat candidate?

Russia and China will be using it to achieve their goals. Does anyone believe that China or Russia or any US adversary is not working hard to influence the November elections? 

It costed Putin and Russia less than $10 million to influence the 2016 election. All US adversaries took notice. And Republicans made it easier for them, by turning it into a partisan issue."
2020-07-21 20:43:56,"Notice the wording ""tried"", ""investigate"" etc in describing the efforts by the two hackers. If they are in the indictment, it seems that the US government does not have very solid ground to indict them NOW. After all, the pair have done similar hacking since 2017, according to the report. Why now? The three recent attempts--none seem to have succeeded-- are all bit weird. China is the country that first released the gene mapping of the coronavirus on Jan 10, so all the scientists in the world including those in this country to start working on the vaccines.  China now has two vaccines that have started the late stage human trial. So it leads the world in vaccine development. So why would they try to steal vaccine info from the US? Surely these two guys are hackers and may be supported by the Chinese government agencies. But even the indictment seems to suggest that they have motivation to make money. To me, this sounds like a case to fit Trump's attempt to shift blame of the pandemic in this country.  After all, it is the CHINESE (whoever they are, individuals and government, all included) who have done it. This is a dangerous slope..."

China is a dysfunctional undemocratic centralized society and economy that is managed by a dictatorial leadership that is using and bleeding its population of poor workers to earn wealth at any price for the benefit and wealth of its monolithic leaders and its minority of wealthy mercantilists.

China’s industries are built on the theft of intellectual property that has been ongoing for many decades.

According to the Intellectual Property Commission’s Report on China of 2017:
<a href=""http://ipcommission.org/report/IP_Commission_Report_Update_2017.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://ipcommission.org/report/IP_Commission_Report_Update_2017.pdf</a>

“IP theft pervades international trade in goods and services due to lack of legal enforcement and national industrial policies that encourage IP theft by public, quasi-private, and private entities. … Since 2013, at the release of the IP Commission Report, U.S. policy mechanisms have been markedly enhanced but gone largely unused. We estimate that the ANNUAL cost to the U.S. economy continues to exceed $225 billion in counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets and could be as high as $600 billion. It is important to note that both the low- and high-end figures do not incorporate the full cost of patent infringement—an area sorely in need of greater research.”

At the center, Chinese families are struggling … in poverty. WHY ???"

We are a global community. America is not an island."

I don't see how the Van Hollen - Sasse bill would accomplish anything. Sanctioning hackers who may never leave China is pointless. And since the hackers are not employed by Chinese companies, sanctioning companies also seems useless. 

A more aggressive approach would be to calculate the economic value of the theft and, under the Administration's greater latitude given to the CIA in cyberwarfare, inflict equivalent economic damage on the Chinese economy, perhaps focusing on disrupting Chinese banking and finance.

Yes, vaccine information should be shared with rest of the world and so should the information about the virus when the country of it’s origin first detect its outbreak. Clearly China hid that formation and let people travel back and forth around the world, Essentially spreading the virus. And now they are trying to take advantage of the economically weaker world to further their territorial and economic ambitions. Why not ask China these questions?"
2020-07-22 04:57:00,"A lot of commenters think vaccine research should be some kind of united open source effort. Im sorry to say, but this isn't Linux, this is a vaccine. Do you think that if China developed a vaccine its going to give it to us at the same it gives it to its own citizens? Do you think China and Russia and Germany and the US are going to set aside their differences and share in the development of anything? The answer to both of those questions is no. The world isn't kumbaya. Russia and China would like nothing better than to develope their own vaccine, inoculate their own citizens and then sell it to everyone else at an inflated price. Like it or not. nationalism and tribalism is what has run the world since the dawn of mankind, and everyone needs to take care of their own right now. That means we should be incredibly angry that China unleashed a virus on the world and then tries to steal the vaccine the US and private companies are spending billions of  dollars on. Instead, we get comments asking why we can't all just get along. Sorry, but the world just doesn't work that way."

2020-07-22 01:08:34,"More surprised that china hasn’t filed charges against american hackers… if you have been following the COVID vaccine developments from the beginning you would know its Oxford/Cansino in 1st place for the COVID vaccine race (only guys so far to publish peer-reviewed PH II results) with Sinopharm and Sinovac close 2nd with Ph III trials in UAE and Brazil.

Moderna and BNT/Pfizer (the US front-runners) are just a bit further behind, but may start PH III trials by late July. Other allegations like hacking into trade secrets for tech and defense are likely true but the idea that China hacked into US data for COVID vaccines doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. They had the outbreak first so they actually had a leg-up on vaccine development which EU has been catching up and lately the Americans. Remember China sequenced and published the genome for COVID-19 back on January 11th, so have likely been working on it since then. EU didn’t start working on this till February and America not until March.

Trump is in a bind, basically the earliest to announce even preliminary results for Moderna or BNT/Pfizer will take about 3 months of Ph III data, so Trump may have to wait until late October to announce promising results to hopefully influence the elections."

She spoke with a subtle excitement of the “Great Reordering,” which is exactly what you probably think it is. I don’t doubt that we’re in a tailspin at the moment and they seem to be ascendant. But I couldn’t resist pointing out that China’s rise is due in no small part to their constant thievery of our innovations. If/when China takes over, we’ll no doubt guard our secrets closer, and probably there may even calls to severely restrict our ties with them. So if they can’t steal from us or attend our universities, how will they stay on top? My date was incredulous at the notion that her country steals anything, which raised another point in my mind but before I could get there, I asked for the check."

China has engaged in a pattern of aggressive and dangerous behavior that has no place in the world. The problem is that the Trump Administration is using China as a campaign hot button issue to get reelected. This is very dangerous because Trump and his minions are incompetent imbeciles who act without thinking strategically and utilize poor short term tactics. This will only cause more problems between the countries."

Once there, its impossible for us to do anything. I am not against an organic growth of China. Their growth is completely fueled by sell out politicians and corrupt capitalists that sold our future out for cheap products. Of course there is the element of Chinese IP theft.  Scary times we live in and its even scary that only Trump ever took any action against China."
