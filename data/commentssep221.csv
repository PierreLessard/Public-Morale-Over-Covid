2021-09-22 11:09:25,"Does Microsoft, Amazon,GM or a host of other companies donate their products to other nations? Why is the pharmaceutical industry singled out? True, everyone on the planet needs to be immunized, but companies also have a right to get remunerated for their efforts and products. The drug companies are the heroes of this story, not the villains."
2021-09-22 11:15:07,"I am not sure why people think Moderna has to share both its technology and scale process for the vaccine with others. It's a superior product that they deserve to control even though they received government funding. Moreover Moderna is not 'big pharma"" as is Pfizer.  Perhaps it would be a lot more useful for them to ship the ingredients to key countries that can then complete the end production process which Moderna would pay for.  Or ask them to spend substantial sums expanding production for export in the US."
2021-09-22 11:23:37,I wonder if sharing the Moderna formulation  would be similar to sharing  a recipe with  a less experienced chef?     Same recipe in new hands tastes different.    How can we trust the final product from another company?
2021-09-22 11:36:46,"The AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines are easier to produce, easier to transport, easier to store, cheaper, and as effective as the mRNA products. AZ is already being produced in India and Korea. There is no reason to emulate the expense and technological problems of mRNA products to meet the goal of universal immunization.  Why does the story not mention the obvious alternatives?"
2021-09-22 11:41:06,"I can understand the reluctance of these companies to share their work. They spent a lot of time, effort and money to develop their vaccines and deserve their reward. But even more importantly their reputation and that of their product is at state. But more importantly, when they are the sole producer of their vaccine, they are responsible for and can control the quality of their vaccine. If a licensed second  company is producing their vaccine and a bad batch is released that causes injury or is ineffective, the reputation of that vaccine is ruined and nobody will want it anymore regardless of whose factory produced it. It is understandable that these companies would want to continue to be the sole producers of their products to control the quality of the vaccine they developed."
2021-09-22 11:52:52,"I sometimes wonder whether Hillary could have been as effective in creating the vaccines as Donald was with Operation Warp Speed.  When I see how Joe has denigrated intellectual property rights, and now that the Dems seem to be supporting forced licensing of the formula, I think the answer is ""NO"".  In addition, there are issues of liability.  I think the Dems would still be arguing about how large a damage award should be allowed for medical problems resulting from the vaccine.

I don't think we would have made it at that rate."
2021-09-22 11:55:37,"I wonder if there is another important issue.  By sharing the state of the art RNA messenger technology needed for the vaccines...it would essentially allow China to leapfrog the time, money and effort needed for their biotech industry to catch up in a general area of biotech development separate from the production of the current vaccines.  Given the current world wide crisis including the interconnectedness of world populations e.g. possible contagion...we need to proceed with the sharing of this technology."
2021-09-22 11:37:16,"I don't remember other nations, the W.H.O. and hectoring international ""activists"" having nearly the same fervor about sharing  development costs of the vaccines as they are about having virtually free access to the results."
2021-09-22 11:37:22,"No, they should not have to share. America is always held to a standard no other country is  and still dragged through the mud, often by our own citizens.

They make it look like the money was the key ingredient in MRNA technology development, no it wasn't. Moderna worked for over a decade to develop this technology and they now want the company to simply give it away. With this effort they are basically asking Moderna to disclose their entire know-how, take a bow and sing kumbaya. For profit medical development is why the U.S. has 3 vaccines available. If there there is no incentive to develop or if IP are forcefully taken away, expect no company to spend their hard earned money and talent on future developments."
2021-09-22 11:50:38,"Moderna's offer to collaborate post the pandemic is akin to bolting the barn door after the horses have left. First, the American taxpayer paid billions to develop a vaccine, including $2.5 billion to Moderna. Now taxpayers are covering the cost  of treatment for Covid patients who refuse to take the vaccine. It's time we held companies and people accountable for plain decency.

2021-09-22 11:30:26,"The market rules, which republicans worship above all things, are hurting the human race. There should be a legal mechanism to expropriate IP that is critical to the nation's wellbeing.

To begin with, the USA partially financed the vaccines. If we gave Moderna and Pfizer so many billions of dollars so that they could make even more billions of dollars, shouldn't WE have a say on it? What would have happened if we didn't have the money to pump into the development of those vaccines? Should we just leave the population to die, sacrificed at the altar of private enterprise and market rules?

Capitalism is a set of construct and ideas that we live by but it is not the end-all bearer of truth nor the resolution to all the problems (Like the GOP's response to every problem the world faces: Tax cuts!). We should at one point be able to distinguish when the rules need bending. This lack of flexibility makes us non-competitive (China and Russia have the legal tools to do it but also have invested billions in government research and development. They do believe that there is a place for government in healthcare, unlike us, who fear everything that is not private) but it also makes us weak. Literally.

If the USA doesn't evolve in way that allows us to compete against China and Russia (who make HEAVY public investments in healthcare) we won't survive the next pandemics. We just won't."
2021-09-22 11:12:47,"It is reasonable for pharmaceutical companies to want to be able to profit of their research. This has been an area that has been hard to profit off of. There are high risks of no results being produced by the research and their efforts being in vain. They should be rewarded for such efforts.

That being said, Moderna and Pfizer have already profited a great deal. The money they have made will ensure the competitiveness of the US pharmaceutical industry in the years to come. They can afford to “stand up a competitor” when they are so far ahead of the competiton. Also, competition is good for the economy. 

Without actually using the Defense Powers act, President Biden should threaten to use it (credibly) to force Moderna to negotiate."
2021-09-22 11:38:03,"The world needs solar power. Please, could China just set us up with a few production lines so we won’t have to spend time figuring out how to produce at scale?

The drug companies didn’t arrive at successful vaccines on their own, that’s true. For example, they got the modified rna sequence from a us government vaccinologist. But they have been developing the basic technology for 15 years. Giving it away is unreasonable. Instead, let them manufacture at cost or remove their licensing for the sequence."
2021-09-22 11:41:19,"It's not fully clear from article, but if you transfer know how about a new mRNA vaccine platform for COVID-19, aren't they also giving away the know how for their entire platform and thus business pipeline for years to come? And once the info is out, it can be replicated by who knows how many competitors. There are other solutions to manufacturing and dispensing the COVID-19 vaccine than giving away tech and know how and years of research and IP in all but name. Also, the mRNA vaccines need much more storage than J&J vaccine. Why are we focused on complex vaccine tech when we have a suitable option with less handling complications from J&J for low income nations?"
2021-09-22 11:41:45,"The value of how to make these vaccines is beyond covid for Moderna.  MRNA manufacturing is a platform from which many other treatments can be spun.  Once others learn the secrets, Moderna becomes less valuable. Since the value of the vaccine is so high, the world should be willing to pay Moderna a price commensurate with the risk of sharing technology. Guarantee them $100 per dose plus revenue from derivative products and watch how fast production gets ramped.  This cost will end up being minuscule compared to the benefit to humanity and the signal to makers of life saving treatments will be clear.  More such innovations will follow."
2021-09-22 11:52:45,"Is this about improving the health of developing nations or using the government to get a jump on the competition?

US companies aren't the only ones with a Covid vaccine. China has two companies manufacturing a vaccine using more conventional biotechnology.

Then there's Russia's Sputnik vaccine, India has a vaccine as does Cuba. There may be others as well.

We never hear any reports on their technology or their efficacy and safety. But these countries all have medical oversight systems similar to our FDA. Why not share that data?

What may differ is simply our manufacturing scale. Because China and Russia are starting to export their vaccine, this may just be a rush to capture as much of the foreign market as possible.

Cuba's predicament is different. Their small but highly effective biotech industry has created two covid vaccines. 

But because of our continuing embargo, which also affects Cuba's ability to get foreign loans, they are unable to fully treat their own population or effectively export their product.

If we are really concerned about worldwide health and stopping the spread of covid, this is one more reason to end the blockade against Cuba."
2021-09-22 11:57:32,It appears that the quickest way to get the vaccines into arms is to increase production at all of the existing sites and continuously ship to nations in need. Companies that relied on US government money and technology need to sell at cost or near cost. Setting up production in 18 months or 36 months in another country is too long. Produce massive amounts and give them away for little or no profit as quickly as possible.
2021-09-22 11:44:30,"Moderna is cooperating in the manufacture and distribution of its products overseas. I do not believe that humanitarian concerns are the only motive that its competitors have in demanding Moderna’s formula and manufacturing methods. There are billions of dollars at stake care, including any benefits to be earned from future mRNA vaccines.

Political and economic motives are driving these demands. Moreover, it’s likely that Moderna’s overseas competitors do not have the expertise to manufacture this  vaccine. We add to the mix that this vaccine is likely more effective, for longer, then the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. Regardless of who financed manufacture of the vaccine, so long as Moderna is responsible in supplying the world and is willing to do so for nothing, I don’t see why the company has any obligation to share its intellectual property.

There are those who believe that all medical intellectual property should be shared. That is a political position  that proponents are exploiting the pandemic to push. I would like to see Moderna and Pfizer, with the cooperation of the G7 nations, donate vaccines and also aid in distribution of vaccines abroad. I see no reason, just excuses, as to why they should give up their intellectual property rights."
2021-09-22 11:56:46,"If the government wanted these companies to not only share their IP but to assist direct competitors to set up competing manufacturing facilities then they should have made the donation/investment contingent on that WRITTEN agreement.

They clearly did not - Moderna should instruct them to go pound salt.

There re many conventional Covid vaccine recipes that can be manufactured without totally destroying a company's competitive advantage."
2021-09-22 11:46:26,"Any day now a highly contagious, highly deadly, vaccine-resistant variant will emerge out of one of the undervaccinated areas of the world and we will all be back to where we were in early 2020. Or worse. 

The billions in taxpayer money that helped develop the vaccines should have come with the condition of sharing it everywhere as quickly as possible. The cost of not doing so could prove catastrophic."
2021-09-22 12:05:21,"I don’t think it’s relevant that Moderna benefitted from federal funding.  It was an extraordinary challenge to develop these vaccines at such speed.  The hard truth is that these biotech (or any tech) companies may not exist without enforcement of their intellectual property rights.  Unless we want our government to permanently fund innovation in biotechnology, much more than it does now, do not force companies to transfer proprietary technology."
2021-09-22 12:07:22,"It seems suspicious to me that no mention is made of all of the other vaccines available around the world. The Russian, Chinese, J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines all come quickly to mind. It seems pretty clear that some of the people pressing Moderna and Pfizer for complete tech transfers (not just of their formulas, but of the entire manufacturing process--including seeking help for acquiring and building proprietary equipment) have some ulterior motives. 

It's completely unreasonable to expect either company to stand up a competitor. And that's exactly what some of the people quoted in this article seem to be requesting. They are donating hundreds of millions of doses and selling hundreds of millions more at cost. And even if they gave away the technology to everyone who wants it, there aren't enough people with this sort of advanced manufacturing expertise to be able to produce the mRNA vaccines in places like Malawi. Moreover, the mRNA vaccines are not just the most difficult to produce (by far), they are also the most difficult to store, most difficult to transfer and therefore most difficult to administer (by far). 

It makes little sense to pursue mRNA vaccine production and distribution in the portions of the world which don't have the manufacturing know-how, storage capabilities or even transportation networks to be able to administer those vaccines. Most of Africa, South & Central America and Central Asia need J&J or AZ, not mRNA, so this all seems a bit suspicious."
2021-09-22 11:20:00,"Of course we must share our vaccine technology! Dr. Salk famously never considered anything but sharing his polio vaccine with the world. The very question, that it should need to be asked, is shocking. The answer we've been given so far is a crime against humanity. Where's an angry god when it's needed? Someone needs some smiting."
2021-09-22 11:43:25,Why would BioNTech and Moderna give up their patents so that competitors get a hold on their intellectual property?
2021-09-22 11:48:58,We have seen this before:share the recipe and manufacturing processes and then watch the Chinese scoop up the entire market.  And the article fails to mention the cold chain requirements for these mRNA vaccines which will be a challenge in Third World and developing nations.  All those do-gooders have little to no understanding of economics and competitive advantages.  If they are so concerned how about seeking reparations from the Asian country responsible for this disaster?

2021-09-22 12:03:41,No! They get nothing. We are splitting hundreds of millions of vaccines to poorer countries. It's enough.
2021-09-22 11:27:47,BioNTech announced today that it will donate another 500 million doses at not-for-profit prices and will continue to donate. They are obviously very willing to help but not by giving up their business plan and intellectual property.
2021-09-22 11:31:00,Don’t do it.   Just have the companies pans in those countries if needed
2021-09-22 12:10:42,"Thank goodness that Moderna and Pfizer are acting to safeguard our biotechnology. Licensing a brand new technology will lead to theft of trade secrets, and could even encourage development of new bioweapons if countries know that they can pre-produce effective vaccines. 

Pfizer did the right thing by agreeing to rap up production. Even if it and Moderna wanted to license technology to developing markets, that would be a huge undertaking and take many months to ramp up. The manufacturing of mRNA vaccines requires a high degree to precision and cold-chain storage that the large majority of countries don't have. 

World leaders should press all major vaccine manufacturers to supply vaccines cheaply, and yes, that includes Astra that is highly effective at preventing serious covid.

Technology transfer would be an unmitigated disaster and serve only to help strategic adversaries."

Take note that Pfizer developed the same type of vaccine in the same time frame with only 100 million dollars from the German government. 

Moderna took 20 times more money to do the same thing in the same amount of time??? 

The execs at Moderna have already lined their own pockets with the additional 2.4 billion dollars. 

We need to jail the people in our government that gave them that much money, get the excess money back from Moderna and force them to give up their tech for the benefit of humanity."
2021-09-22 12:05:49,"As a US taxpayer I would love my government to pay Moderna to increase its production capacity and immunize the world against COVID. I would not even mind if it shifted the entire defense budget to achieve that. However, I totally loath the idea of forcing the company to give away its technology to other countries. 

The US government encouraged American manufacturing to shift its operations to Asia without insisting on worker protections that labor has fought for here. Now it wants to squash its nascent biotech industry?

Infuriating."
2021-09-22 12:07:06,"I see this as a unique situation. This is a global pandemic. World distribution of the vaccines is a matter of saving millions of lives and preventing even more millions of people from lifetimes of sever illness. It's apparent that the current manufacturing and distribution methods are not keeping up with the pace of worldwide need. And the status quo grossly favors the rich nations over the poor. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccinations are not comparable to the products by the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and GM. Vaccines are not a luxury item. This is a matter of life and death. There are times when we must put the life and welfare of our fellow humans above profit. Even if we were to approach this dire situation in purely selfish terms, vaccinating the entire world is the only way to make my the rich nations safe from Covid. The virus doesn't care about political borders. We save ourselves and our humanity by helping other humans."
2021-09-22 12:03:49,"My understanding is that both Pfizer and Moderna were willing to license their covid vaccines at no (or low) cost to third world countries, but they wanted control over production in order to avoid a situation in which a poorly made vaccine killed people and discredited the vaccine brand. That seemed like a reasonable position. The article didn't discuss this. Or, perhaps my understanding is incorrect?"
2021-09-22 12:04:49,"When the first person experiences complications from an American vaccine manufactured abroad by a less experienced 3rd party, where will the fingers be pointed? Who will prevent inferior batches from being dumped around the world to unsuspecting buyers? Hmmmm. 

We have already seen the same debate play out numerous times. IP sharing may sound like a quick fix but is extremely risky, will solve nothing in the short run, and primarily benefits American competitors. The originators of these products will ultimately provide the needed quantities for worldwide use, and they are in the best position to do so. Let them get it done right."
2021-09-22 12:22:13,"The Moderna vaccine requires highly sophisticated machinery, equipment and plants. Even if the technology were to be shared, the plants have to be built and operated properly and that would be challenging for these countries."
2021-09-22 12:29:32,"Yes, Moderna received federal funds but it is better described as a commitment by the government to buy a successfully developed vaccine, not for research.  The government agreed to buy the first successful batches of vaccine.  Additionally we know that Pfizer funded its own development of vaccines spending $2 billion of its own funds, not federal government funds.  And we also know that this research began more than 20 years ago with searches for vaccines to protect against the SARS virus. Operation Warp Speed may have cut red tape for approval but it did not provide funding for research and development.  
For those reasons portraying the drug development companies as murderous entities that simply will not share the formula is greatly misleading. Large scale chemistry to produce massive amounts of vaccines is not chemistry 101.  The equipment for large scale vaccine production is not off the shelf hardware.  There is no way to simply build a production facility and expect that handing over the formula would enable immediate, successful manufacturing of massive amounts of a safe vaccine. 
Licensing a vaccine production process sounds easy. But transferring technology, equipment and expertise is not.  Protecting intellectual property is only one element of this process.  Pressuring pharmaceutical companies to literally give away the goose that lays the golden egg makes no sense.  Future research and American technology infrastructure  is being imperiled."
2021-09-22 12:35:34,The facts are that these RNA machines are not easier to make and the developing countries are already struggling to produce the easier ones which they can alrady license to make in the needed quantities.
2021-09-22 12:36:37,"Emergent BioSolutions offers a cautionary tale about the complexity of outsourcing vaccine production.  They failed spectacularly to produce both the Johnson & Johnson and Astrazeneca vaccines, and they were located in Baltimore, where J&J could have closely supervise their production practices.

The J&J vaccine is much more conventional than Moderna and much easier to produce.  If Emergent BioSolutions couldn’t produce J&J in Baltimore, what makes anyone think that Moderna could be produced in India on the other side of the World?  

Vaccine production is not the same thing as consumer electronics.  The Moderna vaccine technology is revolutionary and billions of doses will be injected into humans.  A defective cell phone is unlikely to kill anybody, but a defective vaccine could cause catastrophic harm or fail to provide protection from COVID-19.

It's hard to blame Moderna for being reluctant to donate their technology when they don't have established partners with a proven track records."
2021-09-22 12:38:01,"The companies stated, they are going to have enough production for worldwide demand by middle of next year. Later advocates for sharing state it would take 18 months with the IP shared to set up manufacturing.

2021-09-22 12:46:56,"The number one vaccine-producing country in the world is not in the West - it is in India.  Which is also either the number one or number two maker of pharmaceuticals.  So when one hears that mRNA vaccine technology is ""so complex"" that these middle-income and other developing countries cannot handle it only leads to one conclusion - protection of massive profits, already backstopped by the largesse of the US taxpayer.  Maybe it's worth looking into the entire palette of steps the all-powerful federal government can take for the benefit of the world - march-in licensing rights are always there as a last resort.  I for one want o see whether the Biden administration can walk the talk."
2021-09-22 12:47:28,"It's way past time to realize that the solution is for the U.S. government to directly develop pharmaceuticals as an alternative to being tied to only relying on profit incentivized corporations.  Does anyone doubt the U.S. could have hired scientists to do what the Moderna or Pfizer scientists did?  It might take some time to ramp up, but its way past time.  Instead of giving handouts to private businesses to develop drugs that are based on a lot of federally financed research in the first place, the government could target health problems that are not being addressed adequately (or affordably) by the private sector and develop the drugs directly.  They would not need to be involved in manufacture, but could simply make the drugs available for manufacture by private sector, without patent restrictions, the way generics are manufactured.  It would not need to be a 'takeover' of the pharmaceutical industry to start making a moderating influence on prices.  After all, why are we so afraid of a little more competition?"
2021-09-22 12:48:06,"What is missing from the discussion is that this same technology is the future of the pharmaceutical industry. While giving it away for a vaccine seems harmless and necessary enough, there is at least one country (not mentioned in article) that knows how to use it to dominate global medicine for the rest of the century."
2021-09-22 12:23:48,"This is ridiculous to place pressure for this company to give up their technology for other countries. All of us end up footing the bill as we pay full price for research and development, then others swoop in and manufacture for pennies on the dollar."

The Times reported in January Pfizer said its vaccine was not engaging enough T-cell response.  Further, it's empirically clear that current vaccines are presenting as insufficient to deal with the Delta.

So why are these ""officials"" and so many others who could begin a search for solutions other than the mRNA tweaked 20th century antibody platforms so closed off to finding other solutions - like a vaccine that specifically harnesses the T-cell side of our immune system, and not cling to tunnel vision on the anti-body side?

Has anyone ever looked into Moderna's track record of losses for the past 10 years and continuing ability to promote rather than an inability to develop efficacious drugs.  Because it is a window into a basic lack of integrity at the top.

Further, how simple is it to deploy vaccines that must be kept at temps from -32 to -92 degrees and then inject them quickly before they degrade?  And what are the real all in costs to make and deploy these vaccines?

The NIH has numerous articles written by prominent  MD scientists and bio scientists about the need to elicit a strong T-cell response to defeat SARS-CoV-2 -- but where is the putsch to find this solution?

With Covid, we have restricted access to the vaccine technology, allowing variants to grow and the disease to become endemic — not to mention an untold count of millions of deaths. Big pharma will make a bonanza out of this, developing and selling medications for years to come. At the very least, they need to share the vaccine tech so it can be manufactured and distributed worldwide."
2021-09-22 12:22:18,"As long as the rest of the world remains unvaccinated, the hope of Americans that the US can open up and resume pre-pandemic life is a pipe dream. All of the virus variants we know of originated abroad, and closed borders do not stop their arrival, as we have seen. Once in, they ravage, and new variants may continue to ravage the country because a high percentage of the population will never accept getting vaccinated. Our best hope then is vaccinating the world with the highest quality vaccines available, which means getting Pfizer and Moderna licensed for production out there. Moderna got to develop its vaccine on the public dime? I'm a taxpayer and would like to see the technology I helped pay for sent abroad. No one is safe anywhere until everyone everywhere is vaccinated."
2021-09-22 12:22:59,"Let’s put morality above the profit motive for once.

Ridding the world of COVID should be a common goal.

After all, success against this virus stands to benefit all humanity.

On the other hand, the longer that COVID lingers, there will be an ongoing need for more and more profit generating vaccine production."
2021-09-22 12:18:54,"We are caught in an impasse between a public good and private benefit. Any company that secured public funding for vaccine development has more than an ethical responsibility to the nation providing those funds. They have a legal responsibility to the will of the people that government represents. They are also caught up in a responsibility to their owners, the shareholders who invested in them.

Our world is shrinking daily and the old rules are giving us a sour taste. These biotech companies need to be more than scientifically creative too, to serve the people they mention in their corporate mission statements. So do our political leaders.

Unless we can square this circle, we will foster more than hard feelings---there will be a lot of dead bodies."
2021-09-22 12:21:19,"The Moderna investment could have been structured from the as an equity investment by the government, not as a “grant”. We should develop a model that enables more funding for possible drugs e.g. vaccines for diseases that are not yet at crisis levels but could become so. We know Zika and Dengue and encephalitises are in North America but are not yet major threats. At some point they could be. A SARS vaccine was prototyped in 2005. 
More investment in vaccine and medical research for rare disease treatments should be funded by public money, with some view to recapturing the investment if the product is ever scaled up. These fundings don’t have to be looked at as free money, at least not for specific drugs or treatments what could later be sold at a profit. 
If and when the drug is needed and production is ramped up, the pharma manufacturer gets to keep the manufacturing revenue but there should be a payback to the investor, in this case the public money. If the company wants to sell licenses overseas, that’s fine; it was widely done during WWII for certain technologies. If when a occasion of great need arises it is then decided that the government is going to foot the bill, let that be a separate decision made at the time and based on need or other current circumstances. 
Funding could easily come from special purpose, government issued, low interest bonds. Treasury could hold the bonds, or could sell them privately."
2021-09-22 12:20:39,"These are some of the most complex molecules ever to be produced, distributed and dosed in humans.  This is not “off the shelf” chemistry (like for small molecule drugs).  Even sharing the technology won’t help if the countries receiving it have none of the technology infrastructure to produce them.  The reason Pfizer, Moderna and JNJ were able to produce their vaccines so quickly, was that all of the background research and infrastructure was already available.  Essentially, they dropped the COVID gene into the pre-developed system and were off to the races."
2021-09-22 12:48:30,Most truly novel pharmaceutical products begin as the product of research funded by taxpayer money - usually through the NIH in the United Stated. Then the researchers sells the rights to the products without the government having any interest. That should change so the government retains an interest proportional to its financial contribution towards the initial development of such products that can then be used to support the cost of a single payer universal health care system.
2021-09-22 12:29:17,"Yet the republican criminals (or manchin) refuse to allow the US government to negotiate with big pharma.

disgusting."
2021-09-22 12:46:11,"Clarification of sub-headline:

 Moderna accepted $2.5 billion of “U.S.” taxpayer money.  

Other governments had the opportunity to subsidize a vaccine drug maker, yet failed to do so."
2021-09-22 12:42:03,The Oxford Astra Zenica vaccine is sold not for profit which is presumably why it is bieng used in 182 countries but has not received US approval.  Too socialist by far.
2021-09-22 13:01:34,"It's not really 'Pfizer's' vaccine - it was developed by BioNTech in Europe and is made by them there. My two shots were German manufactured - there was not a mention of Pfizer anywhere on the packaging or the documentation.

BioNTech seems to have a good deal of leeway as a 'partner' - they licenced the technology to a CHINESE manufacturer last month. I think the relationship between BioNTech and Pfizer is a bit more nuanced than is implied in the article.

And, no mention of the Astra-Zeneca - the world's workhorse vaccine? Now the shroud-waving about almost non-existent (and likely, contrived) 'safety concerns' has died away, it's being used in just about every country in the world - except the US. The reason? Not only is it cheap, AZ have issued manufacturing licenses to just about anyone who wants one.

Once the pandemic is past, the history books will NOT be recording that it was Pfizer and Moderna that 'saved the world'."
2021-09-22 12:43:09,"These countries can neither build nor fund the technology needed to provide vaccines in a timely fashion.  Therefore, donating vaccines to them with our hard earned tax dollars makes more sense to save lives and improve the world economy.  Additionally, buying services from private companies does not entitle the government to own the production or intellectual capital.  The government buys stuff from the private sector because they can't efficiently deliver or even produce those good.  Example, CoVid testing kits created by the CDC.  This is not a Marxist society and barring decades of leftist Democrat administrations it never will be.   NYT editors and writers should read history and see the problems with communism and centralized control of production and stop acting like it should be."
2021-09-22 12:43:37,"I really don’t understand this need. According to the NYT’s world map on Covid, the USA has the most cases per 100,000. Is the reporting suspect? If not, it would seem to me that our own Country is in bigger need than the remainder of the world. So why share vaccines, if they are all in better shape."
2021-09-22 12:59:39,If we give away our tech the next pandemic we wont have a vaccine. We can provide vaccines for the world.
2021-09-22 12:35:40,It should be the law to share discoveries that eradicate disease.
2021-09-22 12:55:54,"My guess is that individuals responsible for the development of COVID vaccines are being handsomely, financially rewarded.  And they deserve to be.  Especially when so much of taxpayer money was doled out to develop them.

It's never enough in the USA.

After you're rich enough to buy--or make--a rocket ship co. that can put you in orbit for a couple hours or days, then what?

Donald's Uncle Scrooge used to pile his money up in a huge room, climb onto a diving board, and jump into the middle of it.  

What's the point of amassing wealth, especially when one alternative is to save billions of lives.  You'd be a hero.  And probably still fabulously rich."
2021-09-22 12:50:10,And we wonder why rest of the world hates us - endless pursuit of profits at any cost!
2021-09-22 12:50:19,"Many of the fundamental discoveries about nRNA over the past 30 years did not come from the Federal Government, as seen in the assorted prizes granted to scientists for the work outside the NIH.  Perhaps more importantly, the lipid nano-technology required for the vaccines came exclusively from the private sector, as did the manufacturing expertise.  The mRNA vaccines are unique, and the comment from the WHO that “they know vaccines” is like someone riding a bicycle saying they can fly a jet.  Further, given what we know about the WHO and it’s obeisance to China, it would seen guaranteed that trade secrets would be stolen as soon as the technology was licensed.  Moderna and Pfizer are being understandably cautious."
2021-09-22 13:00:46,"Another attempt at open borders. This is another attack on our sovereign rights and no different than the attack on our southern borders. All brought by the same people who think the world should be one big commune with some people contributing way more than others. It doesn't make the world better, it just builds more resentment towards the takers."
2021-09-22 12:55:21,"I can  already hear the complaints after we give this to them , Then they will want us to build the manufacturing and pay for all associated costs. All these countries act like they are one of our states. It's just more foreign welfare and it needs to end.  We need to take care of home and they need to stop begging. Take care of your own problems anf figure out your own solutions."
2021-09-22 12:34:21,"The J & J vaccine manufactured by Janssen, had many manufacturing hiccups, and does not seem to be mentioned in the article.
Similarly, no mention is made of the vaccines provided by China and Russia. While not distributed in North America, they are both providing many doses.
The US does not need to ""save"" the world every time. Afghanistan comes to mind."
2021-09-22 12:42:56,"Until the rest of the world is vaccinated, mutant strains will continue to emerge there, and we'll never fully emerge from this disease here. We need to look at the bottom line for humanity, rather than sacrifice our own health and humanity for the sake of the profits of corporations, because if we leave our own humanity behind, we lose everything."
2021-09-22 12:45:55,"These vaccines are complicated to make and it is best that they be made by the existing companies. They can scale up to meet demand by next year, and right now the constraint is in all the materials that are needed. The govt should be focused on other things e.g. not handing out free money to everyone forcing shortages, not buying all the vaccine doses that are produced and letting so much go to waste (leave it to the more efficient private sector). Pfizer and BioNTech are already giving 1 billion doses at a not for profit price - a giveaway of more than $10 billion to the US govt and world. Gilead gave away the rights to manufacture remdesivir at a heavy cost to shareholders and they have got nothing in return. Does anyone thank them? Does anyone recognize what the company did? No, the people daft or indoctrinated enough to pillory drug companies will keep doing it no matter what."
2021-09-22 12:36:46,"We should help others, but the formulae etc. should remain the property of the companies.  We also need to be honest and consistent with booster doses here in the U.S. when many other advanced nations are advocating for them.

Finally, these vaccines have very tight storage requirements.  What guarantee do we have that they won't be contaminated before being injected thereby becoming useless.  This needs careful thought."
2021-09-22 12:36:48,So we can transfer nuclear submarine technology but not vaccine technology?
2021-09-22 12:57:41,"I do not think for one nanosecond that either Moderna or Pfizer should license their technology to other nations, especially those where Russia, China and other malevolent state actors have influence and a presence and for whom the race to destroy the American and Western way of life is an enduring passion. 

Vaccines can be provided to low- and middle-income countries without joint ventures.  Just manufacture the serum, and ship it abroad.

Let NGOs handle the logistics."
2021-09-22 12:36:12,"Considering that much, if not most of the fundamental research into mRNA was carried out in NIH, Defense Department and other federally-funded laboratories, it would appear that the US has a claim to some degree of ownership of the patents in question.  It may have chosen not to exercise its patent rights but could certainly do so in future for all products based on US-funded research.  A rather heavy stick to wave at big pharma and other beneficiaries of US government-funded research, including GM drugs resulting from the Human Genome Project."
2021-09-22 12:42:50,"I'm not sure I understand this point of view that seems designed to push a narrative here. Of course, it would be good to have more global vaccinations. However...recently China claimed that it had crossed the 1 billion vaccinations mark (SinoVac). Russia and India have their own vaccines. UK has the AstraZeneca vaccine that is quite a different mechanism than the Moderna/Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 
Why isnt there a clarion call for all the countries to share their vaccines and technology?"
2021-09-22 12:53:44,"Companies closely guard propriatory technologies zealously.  But there's a larger value here than stock price and executive bonuses.  These biotech firms have a moral imperative to ""save the world"".  Literally!  They will continue to make plenty of money."
2021-09-22 12:37:01,"""Upstart"", really? Any company receives a deposit on future work. Perhaps they aren't as large as Pfizer, which I think is a good thing: Less bureaucracy (and Remora-like entanglements) but Moderna has delivered."
2021-09-22 13:14:01,"Private backing for innovative therapeutics will evaporate if intellectual property isn't protected, and publicly funded basic research is not directed at large scale production.   Wealthy countries need to step up and pay for, or subsidize, commercially produced vaccines for the developing world.  The US and EU should negotiate with Moderna and Pfizer to take a hit on profits on these vaccines, but let then hold on to the intellectual property they have spent years developing."
2021-09-22 13:15:03,"My interpretation of the WHO stance is that they are trying to access the mRNA technology, less for Covid 19 than for possible future applications. There are several more traditional Covid 19 vaccines that are effective and easier to manufacture (e.g., J and J, Astra Zeneca, ...) that could be developed much faster at multiple locations throughout the world. Moderna and BioNTech have a unique technology, and would like to see them (and American pharma manufacturing for Moderna ) maintain their technology edge. In my opinion, the best outcome would be for Pfizer and Moderna to make as much vaccine as possible and ship around the world, and for the more traditional vaccine be produced in as many countries as possible."
2021-09-22 13:39:38,"As always, there are competing public interests here.  To encourage development of future medications, we should want Moderna to be fully compensated for the value of its intellectual property and expertise.  On the other hand, world-wide vaccination against covid helps not just developing countries, but also the developed world.  Maybe the U.S. should buy Moderna (current market cap = $175B), retain the covid intellectual property and refloat the balance of the company.  We have spent $5 trillion or so in the past 18 months and are looking at another $4.5 trillion under consideration now, so the net cost of getting the covid vaccine intellectual property/expertise would be relatively tolerable.  This approach would encourage future development while also dealing with worldwide covid vaccination issues.  [The $2.5B the U.S. funded is a red herring.  If the government wanted a call on the vaccine technology as a price for the $2.5B, it should have said so at the time.  Had the U.S. made that demand, my guess is that Moderna would have gone to private equity for the funding.  The PE funding would have been expensive, but much cheaper than giving up its intellectual property in perpetuity.]"
2021-09-22 13:43:46,"As much as big pharma is the true devil, I side with them. Yes, they accepted the money. It was practically thrown at them. Everyone who signed the contract presumably understood the terms and conditions. It is - and I really cannot believe I am saying this - not fair to expect them to give away their formula and processes just because other countries are less advanced. Apply that logic to everything and you end up with a second rate watered down country that will soon be in that same position of begging for charity. No thanks."
2021-09-22 14:00:52,The commentators are angry at Pfizer and Moderna for only being interested in profits. But the commentators  are implicitly only interested in not paying more taxes. The US government could pay these drug companies for their vaccines to be made available for use in foreign countries  just as the US government did for its own citizens.  It is wonderful that these vaccines have been developed by a combination of  inputs by government and industry. It is amazing that so many readers of  the NYT would be bashing these companies at this time.
2021-09-22 13:38:54,"Assuming the U.S. is a Christian nation -- which many claim it is -- we have a moral obligation to help the poor nations.  The Evangelical Party should be pushing to help any nation that needs it.  
Moderna is the only company that did not use taxpayer money to create its vaccine.  Accordingly, Moderna is the only company that should be allowed to retain legal rights to its vaccine."
2021-09-22 14:04:17,"Sharing the 'health pie' more equitably is plain justice, given that Big Pharma took advantage of public funds as well. Besides, in a world health crisis that may boomerang back to us, it would be foolisn not to distribute the ability to produce vaccines....so to put an end (if that's possible) to Covid. Besides, its the right thing to do morally. In this case a human right that must be made accessible even to the least among us!"

It is well past time for Biden to declare a national emergency. This is the worst emergency, in terms of citizens dying, this country has faced since maybe the civil war. We went to war when 3000 people were killed at Pearl Harbor
and again on 9/11. The vaccine companies are the worst enemies the world faces.
And the government financed Moderna's research, adding insult to injury. Their suggestion that they would release their secrets after the pandemic is wanton cruelty."
2021-09-22 13:06:10,"So why do we give billions to organizations like WHO and the UN? Where's all the money and what exactly have they done during this pandemic except issue demands on the United States? I think  over the years we have given them enough to develope, manufacture and vaccinate  the entire planet  multiple times."
2021-09-22 13:30:53,"When the US Govt funded, with our tax dollars, these vaccine developments, how was there not a contractual agreement on the intellectual property?  I believe there was and the USG failed to acquire ownership. Blame that on the Trump administration. 
Moderna et al are trying to protect their future developments of vaccines.  Blame that on greed over altruism."
2021-09-22 13:33:55,"Licensing patent knowledge out is common in pharma, but we have to guard against enemy states like Russia and China, the latter of whom has already stolen tens of billions in technology from the US.

2021-09-22 13:06:01,"Why didn’t we make licensing a precondition for providing the original funding? Who was President when this deal was made? Oh... never mind.

I think a way forward would be to issue an additional contract for the vaccines the US wants to acquire. It would be an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) with a provision that if the contractor cannot guarantee the t will be able to fill any order on time, it must license.  This should cover us ion the near term and if any unexpected surge arises."

2021-09-22 13:26:43,"Another take on this is to offer Moderna $100 billion or more to build plants and capacity themselves around the world with governments assisting with supply chain and logistics.  Governments would bear the bulk of the costs and if Moderna profits by 100 billion, 200 billion or more, the world would benefit by TRILLIONS of dollars in economic benefit and millions of saved lives.  We need to get past this idea that the goal is to keep pharma companies from making money when such a valuable product has been created."
2021-09-22 13:40:02,"Perhaps yet another ""fantastic deal"" made by the greatest dealmaker of our lifetimes, Donald Trump.  Why was the support and knowledge given to Moderna done without contractual agreements to reimburse the US in the form of patent licensing when the deal was struck?
Pfizer did this all on it's own, similar to Ford back in 2008, when GM and Chrysler got bailouts.  So Trump and his minions take credit for creating the vaccines, and yet all production and distribution is being paid for by our tax dollars, and no recourse to get vaccines into other parts of the world where the virus will continue to spread back to us without world-wide distribution.
The art of the deal indeed!"
2021-09-22 13:15:28,Free market with honest profit motive is the best way to distribute vaccines to the world. The technology should not be given away. Governments should not take away private property. Government money was not given with the understanding that it's government property. Capitalism is the best way to make things work.

2021-09-22 14:11:18,"Like any other patent-holder, the companies that developed these ""novel"" vaccines deserve to be reimbursed for the money and effort they invested to develop their product. But they don't need to be greedy. In a pandemic with no time to spare the companies should help poorer nations deliver the vaccine to all their populations and eliminate this international scourge and move on to other pressing health issues. The companies like Moderna have the tech expertise to devise vaccines against other pressing diseases. They should let other less tech advanced companies do the routine manufacturing while they devise the latest strategy for fighting other disease still ravaging populations and those yet to arise."
2021-09-22 14:25:46,"As I understand it, the biggest bottleneck is in vaccine components, especially the polar lipids, which are complicated to manufacture.  If the technology were released to the world, then Pfizer's and Moderna's would be brought to a crawl, as they would have to compete for access to reagents.  In the end, it wouldn't really do much to increase the rate of vaccine manufacture.  It might even slow it down.  What we need is more reagents."
2021-09-22 14:28:10,"Okay, I'm a chemical engineer with 40 yrs. experience so let me make this plain:


You can't pass technology to other countries. You might as well ask Rembrandt to teach you how to paint. Patents involving process technology are nearly impossible to license, especially when they involve new technology.


Second, why should the good money taxpayers spent developing this technology go to competing countries who will under-cut us?


Alternatively, let's mass-produce the vaccine here. Let us create a facility that can be used to develop future vaccines for future viruses  for the whole world to share."

2021-09-22 14:16:30,"For US companies, e.g Moderna, even during the worst and most deadly pandemic in history, it is all about greed.

What this article doesn't mention is that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was not, repeat not, getting one single penny from  Tump's Operation Warp Speed, but that the German company which developed the vaccine was subsidized with $445 million by German tax payers.

Before the pandemic, BioNTech, a company of then about 50 employees was founded by a married couple of Turkish origin. Since its founding,  BioNTech was researching new cancer treatments, trying to find out which different treatments would have more positive outcome than the present ones.

Early last year BioNTech started concentrated  on developing  their Covid-19 vaccine. while dropping the former research."

These mRNA vaccines are a logistical nightmare, not just because they must be produces at frigid temperatures. You need a lot of supplier, that can keep up to the delivery chain, you need experts to operate the production.
We should rather focus on fast worldwide delivery. We have six day from production to injection. Meeting that objective sounds more feasible to me."

Big pharma is entitled to make profits, technology transfer cannot happen, we must protect the IP.

Let's not forget one thing: developing an IP requires a lot of 'capital'. There is no example in the modern world where tech IP was created without sufficient backing of wealthy investors. 

I am not saying that pharma companies should give away everything for free. I am merely pointing out the hypocrisy of many Americans. They never stop complaining about American businessmen hoarding wealth in the US but immediately become their advocates when it comes to sharing wealth/knowledge with the rest of the world."
2021-09-22 14:15:13,"I’m not sure I understand the narrative behind pharma companies being compelled to donate expertise and resources that would put them at a competitive disadvantage despite having been given tax breaks and other advantages from the government. It wasn’t that long ago that the US bailed out Wall Street banks due to a self-caused crisis that gravely impacted the world. What are those banks doing today to help countries suffering from Covid— offering low interest development loans? What about the massive auto bailout? Are Ford and GM helping to set up automation factories in other countries that have been devastated by Covid? My point is that pharma companies are just as capitalistic as all the others and they should not be called in to do special duty that companies from other industries are never called to make. The way to do it would be to set up a non-profit vaccine company, one that would produce Covid vaccines but also to develop medications (vaccines and antibiotics) for countries that can’t afford to pay for those coming from private for-profit firms."

Then it would seem the fastest route to vaccine distribution would be for governments to assist in the expeditious construction of Moderna and Pfizer plants worldwide for the production of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, under the direct control of Moderna and Pfizer.  Rather than to take the trade secrets away from them, just help them to scale up production.  That approach would not require new clinical trials."

Just another big lie that the “republicans” swallow hook, line & sinker and squawk like parrots.

The J&J vaccine is superior to the mRNA vaccines for use in most of the Third World because, unlike mRNA vaccines, it does not require ultra low freezer temperatures for storage. It only requires simple refrigeration which is available in most of the world, even in remote corners. J&J set about designing such a vaccine because it realized that undemanding storage requirements would be necessary to reach beyond advanced economies to deal with this pandemic.

Several African countries have returned mRNA vaccines because they could not comply with the storage requirements. Stories like this are prompted by self proclaimed “internationalists” and organizations like the WHO that have an agenda removed from control of this pandemic. Because they do not explain their agenda, they leave it to the rest of us to surmise what it might be."
2021-09-22 15:00:38,"Everyone yammering about how much the zUS government ""gave"" Moderna is missing the point.  The idea for mRNA vaccines is over ten years old and has been widely discussed in medical literature.  The concept is fairly obvious, given our current understanding of virus-cell interaction.

Yes, much of that current understanding came from university research, often though not universally funded by various government agencies here, in Europe and in East Asia.

But actually MAKING a vaccine that was able to get the mRNA snippets into the cell has taken a decade for Moderna and BioNTech to perfect.  They worked on the task largely using venture capital and foundation funding.  If governments now take their intellectual tual property and give it to the rest of the world, the foundation funding may continue, but the larger stream from venture capital will cease.

At the next pandemic there is likely to be no 90% ready body of work by which to respond to the organism.  None of the vaccines using older technologies comes close to the efficacy of the mRNA shots, and all shown somewhat higher incidencies of complications.  Moderna and BioNTech did the hard work to prove what was only a tantalizing theory.  They deserve the massive profits they'll make.

If governments want to help, they can build Boeing-sized manufacturing facilities and charge the companies a reasonable rent to use them with the agreement that the products will be profit limited."

2.  Does it make sense to target the vaccine tech for the most complicated, difficult to transport & administer vaccines instead of the more traditional ones?  There are parts of THIS country - my parents in TX - that couldn’t get pfizer vaccine until it was shown to be fridge stable, but now it’s the best option for Benin? Conspicuously missing in this discussion are J&J, AZ, Serum Institute of India, SinoVac, who all make simpler, easier to administer, often as effective vaccines. 

3. If manufacturing complicated vaccines was possible/easy/sustainable in developing countries, wouldn’t it be happening already?  Setting aside mRNA tech, tech for conjugated, lyophilized, nano-particle and/or complex subunit vaccines has been around for ages & used to make vaccines for significant diseases in these regions. MPP, the Tech Transfer Hub, MSF have had ample opportunity to get these platforms up & running, & yet there are very few companies capable of doing any of these (if any at all). Emergent, in BALTIMORE, screwed up the much simpler J&J shot!

￼Aside from the debate about breakthrough infections, there also is global concern from a public health perspective about the delta variant’s ability to lower the efficacy of current vaccines. The marvel of mRNA is that it can almost instantly be reprogrammed to optimally immunize against nasty new variants, so next year’s covid booster shot should be able to block delta and more. 

I’m glad that Biden is calling for a global set-aside or relaxation of patents on covid vaccines. In fact he can exert muscle of the fact that our NIH co-owns the patent on mRNA itself, which presumably they’ve licensed to bioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna for their own patented vaccines. Both of these firms have profited massively from their success, particularly Moderna which leveraged this protected mRNA technology off billions in taxpayer dosh.

Specific to Moderna, though. They were an unproven company at the time that they entered into agreements with the Federal government to provide this vaccine. An enormous risk was taken on them. It can't be denied that our investment put their company on the map. They have now proven some exciting new technology that's been developed in recent decades. 

All kinds of doors are now open to them to take their profits from this big win, and plow those into vaccines for all kinds of other diseases. 

Again, we helped put them on the map. Their future is bright. But we have a need. The world is still mired in this pandemic, and across most of the world they don't even have the supply yet to reveal who their anti-vax nutjobs are. 

We need to get as many shots out there as we can to return to a near-normal and have the world economy healed and moving forward again. This is actually a major humanitarian issue.

It makes sense to concentrate vaccines on the part of the world which has the most serious current problems.  The US still has 2000 deaths per day and ER's in much of the US are shutting their doors because of the excess of COVID patients.

In the midst of this, two companies, Moderna in the US and Biontech in Germany developed a new technology that seems to be better than the old vaccine technology.  It is based upon putting a small piece of messenger RNA in a lipid nanoparticle which is then delivered to the patient.

This technology seems to have better efficacy than the old technology, which has been used by most pharma companies in the past.  That includes J&J for example and many pharma companies in Europe, in Russia, in China and India.

Biden wants to hobble the US biotech industry by giving this advance away to third world countries?  Which means of course to the other pharma companies that produce vaccines.

This makes no sense.  We need to CONTINUE developing the new technology because the virus is evolving.  That means we need companies like Moderna and Biontech to develop NEW VACCINES with the speed with which they developed the first vaccine.

2021-09-22 16:31:46,"The limiting factor is likely to be the expertise to manufacture the vaccine.   Moderna is a small company.   How many employees do they have with the necessary expertise?   How many of them are working on the next generation of vaccines?   How many would be willing to relocate to some distant, dangerous, third-world country to help set up a vaccine plant there?"
2021-09-22 16:22:06,"If the US had taken equity in Moderna for the $2.5B R&D grant, that equity would be worth several tens of billions now.  Grant-making Institutions like the NIH, NSF, DARPA, US DOE, etc.  need to get more commercial about the terms they extract for the money they give away.  There is doubtless a social benefit to this process, but given the vast private fortunes that are being created from the work that is being funded, there is also clearly much money being left on the table that the taxpayer could also benefit from. 

For example, Moderna, which took money from the Govt, has seen its stock zoom by >3000% since then. How much more good could $75B have done the Federal Govt had they taken equity from Moderna? 

It’s not like there isn’t a precedent for this - after all, the Feds did take warrants from the big banks and AIG after the 2008 crisis, and did well with them.  If only they had also taken warrants in the airlines last year in exchange for the bailouts, there would probably be a few more hundreds of billions of bucks available. 

There’s civilian welfare where Govt redistributes largesse to those in need so they don’t live hand-to-mouth … and then there’s corporate welfare, American-style, where the Govt just gives away money so venture capitalists and corporate executives can live large on the public dole."

More recently, millions of doses of Covid vaccine had to be tossed for the same reason. And anyway, none of it is as simple as sharing an interesting tray bake recipe.

Go to China or India for help, they are supposed to be  manufacturing giants, vaccine makers to the world and oh so smart. Get help from them. 

Even if we were to give this to them there would still be complaints and they would just demand more.  We fight the wars to protect them, help them  during natural disasters,  feed their overpopulated countries, send them free medicine that Americans have to pay high prices for, give them jobs, give them our manufacturing, educate many of them, take in many of their unskilled or unedcuated and now they want even more.

It should be a hint that the vaccine was not produced by NIH but by a company that has been public for many years.  Prior to SARS-CoV2 Moderna thought it was an anti-cancer company. So no, the US federal government provided fees for service to produce a customized vaccine for SARS-CoV2.  It did not pay for the entire company to freely distribute all future products produced by Moderna. 
Let's be clear -- most of the costs of developing the basic technology were paid by Moderna.
Finally, there is simply no way that WHO officials can certify that a company is prepared to produce an mRNA vaccine, since those WHO officials are not privy to the proprietary methods used.

     They wanted to substitute a word with a respectable connotation, “property,” for a word that had an unpleasant ring, “privilege.” [They] knew that there was no hope of saving the institution of patent privileges except under an acceptable theory … and in deliberate insincerity “construed the artificial theory of the property rights of the inventor” as a part of the rights of man.»

This is unbelievably complicated technology, the manufacturing is extremely complex, and it's not even that - it's access to the MATERIALS required not only to make the vaccines, but to store and transport them. If Moderna (and others) simply gave away the technology, that would cause a global race for the raw materials, and make these vaccines more difficult to get rather than less! And that's not even mentioning, what happens when the first licensee messes up a batch? How would we know? When ""vaccinated"" people start catching covid?

Great for humanity; very bad for Moderna.

Yes, the giant South African and Indian drug manufacturers, which generally copy US and European drugs and don't do their own R&D, would be delighted if the UN (and US progressives) are able to shame Moderna into agreeing to a no-cost, ""full tech transfer"" of the entire mRNA platform -- research, development and manufacturing processes.

These are Moderna's family jewels, a breakthrough platform developed at great cost and scientific effort over more than a decade.  The mRNA platform holds huge promise for developing many treatments, and paying off shareholders over many decades.

President Biden must find a way to split this baby -- continue to incentivize pioneering firms like Moderna, while making the fruits of their efforts widely available at low cost to humanity.  To date, US vaccine efforts have been halting, tardy and ineffective.  We waste our time squabbling about boosters while ignoring carnage in Africa.

C'Mon Joe, you can do better."

2021-09-22 18:02:26,"Sorry, rest-of-world - our mRNA, even our closer-to-traditional vaccines cannot and should not be sent to any location not equipped with guaranteed 24-7-360/“9 9s” (thats 99.9999999 percent of the time guaranteed power) and ultra-freezers. To do otherwise is an unspeakable waste.
Many relatively poor countries have facilities already to manufacture less effective against SARS-COVID-2 virus but more stable traditional modified/“killed”/partial virus vaccines brewed in eggs, stabilized with HgCl formula and instructions already available from moderately poor nations.
Without guarantees that you have power to keep vaccines at dry-ice temps, sending them to you is a waste for both nations and people.
Yes, in cities with stable power, the millions of doses shipped by US and CE can be effective, but they would turn bad if sent to communities without the proper facilities.
China, India and Russia have vaccines that do not require low-temperature storage, and I hate telling you to make do with less-effective vaccines you can even make yourself - or your neighbors can.
But, this is the best for everyone - wasting vaccine is a crime. If you can guarantee a line of recipients for a planeload of single-shots needing only almost-regular fridge temps, either US or CE/UK will send J&J or A-Z. If you cannot, get directions through WHO and start cooking.
Single-shots are probably best if you can’t guarantee second round, the US can’t even get 10 percent of its vaxed to get 2nd!"

As soon as they succeed, they will waste no time to flood the US and world market with cheaper versions, and use it as a diplomatic tool to buy out influence in developing countries. Biotechnology is about the only advanced technology that the US is left to have an edge over our adversary countries. If we give it up, we have nothing left. In case of a bio-attack, what are we left to defend ourselves?

Moderna’s mRNA platform can be plugged into many, many applications, and creates imminent possibilities in vaccines and medical treatments. Therefore, if Moderna gives out its covid-vaccine technology, it means giving up its whole mRNA technology. The US government should help to guard the Moderna technology as our top bio-defense asset.

Moderna was a tiny start-up founded by a few nerd professors from MIT and Harvard, joined by a group of young scientists. Together they have created a higher caliber of mRNA technology, the best in the world. It’s able to pack a larger dose in one delivery, can be stored in normal freezer temperature, less-waning over time, and a much lower rate of severe allergic reaction. These days almost all the big pharma want to jump into the mRNA market. I am sure they would love to have you egg on Moderna until it reveals all its trade secrets. Do you want to be a supporter of big pharma and authoritative states? The choice is yours!"

With respect, you have no clue what you are talking about. No one is forcing Moderna or anyone else to give anything away. Moderna would be paid a royalty under any license agreement.

In some ways though the genie is out of the box already. Biontech has transferred their technology to Fosun pharma in China because China forces everyone to transfer technology to advance their domestic industry. But why force Moderna to do the same?

Just like what has happened in software, electronics and other industries. 10 years from now we will read an article about how Moderna and Pfizer have outsourced US production of all medicines to South Africa and China so that they can focus on R&D.

I am talking about India, China, USA, Canada, Israel, UK, EU, Russia, Switzerland, and more.   That is a solid step.

That said, no doubt more can be done, and more  vaccines can be distributed, but we should also include the vaccines that already exist, and those on the launching pad.

The slower approach is building that capacity in South Africa and elsewhere.

That slower approach is not a problem for the W.H.O., because its long game is the development of sophisticated pharmaceutical capability in South Africa and other developing nations. The Covid-19 pandemic presents an opportunity.

The same with the patents. While Moderna got a lot of U.S. funding, it is none of WHO business. Mind you, Moderna is for profit company even if it is partly funded by the U.S. taxpayers but not the WHO or COVAX. It is at the U.S. government discretion, not someone else"

2021-09-23 14:27:06,"Pressure is growing on American drug companies…”

Can I ask the obvious? Was this stipulation to license the technology, should its development be successful, not part of the Trump Administration “deal” to fund the R&D at Moderna?
Apparently not. So now, the world wants to ""persuade"" Moderna to essentially give away their process, equipment, tribal knowledge and its formula which will be used to develop myriad new vaccines in the future. 
Good luck with that."
2021-09-23 14:33:50,"I spent my career in researching and developing novel medicines.  On several occasions, part of my job was to manage situations involving the manufacture of a medicine at new/different manufacturing facility.  In two cases, the facility was purchased and repurposed for manufacturing more of a medicine (we needed more capacity).  The timelines were much, much longer than originally assumed and, in one case, the project was abandoned.  In other cases, there was a full tech transfer to another company and the medicine that they manufactured turned out slightly differently than the original, necessitating additional clinical studies (FDA requirement), and this was using the same cell line and raw materials.  Based upon my experience and in my opinion, the fastest timeline to achieve the end goal of vaccinating everyone in the world, is to pay the existing manufacturers to make the vaccine.

Also, manufacturing a small molecule medicine is difficult enough and many aren't exactly the same as the original.  A novel technology that is challenging well beyond the skill level required for small molecules could lead to disaster.  Imagine just using a tech transfer to get manufacturing of the mRNA vaccines going at another facility (no clinical trial) but the  resulting vaccines aren't exactly the same.  What then?  We would have millions of people vaccinated with something that may not work.  <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/opinion/drug-market-prescription-generic.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/opinion/drug-market-prescription-generic.html</a>"

Why should the government pay the $2,400 plus the cost of infusion to treat those who would not get vaccinated?  At least base it on the ability to pay for the unvaccinated, maybe with an added tax to help reduce the cost of providing treatment to the vaccinated who acted responsibly but still go infected because of all the unvaccinated carriers.

Why does the drug cost $2,400 a dose?  How much profit are the drug companies making off each does?  With its volume purchases, the government should negotiate better prices."

These occur in far -- by orders of magnitude -- higher percentages than we see for adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines.

Finally, for those who say that the technology for creation of monoclonal antibodies has been around longer than that for the Pfizer of Moderna mRNA vaccines, they are correct, but the technology for the JJ vaccines has been around much, much longer than for monoclonal antibodies.  Oh, for those who say that the vaccines utilized fetal cells during development, well, the same is true for vaccines.  The bottom line, if someone is willing to take one of the monoclonal antibody treatments, there is no reason to refuse any of the vaccines, unless, of course, you are making a political statement and don't really care if the country beats the pandemic and returns to a semblance of normality.

Nobody is suppressing this treatment that has been proven effective to a certain extent.  But this treatment is less tested than vaccines, it costs the government and insurance thousands of dollars instead of the government buying a vaccines for a few dollars, it doesn’t work as well as vaccines, and now there are shortages and so it’s being rationed.  (Fortunately, there are only shortages in the South, and well-vaccinated states have surplus supplies.) Also, for profit hospitals are shunning the treatment for-profit hospitals are shunning the treatment because it’s a ""hassle,"" ""doesn’t scale.”   The treatment also involves many hours or days of hospitalization and needles, and of course you have caught this deadly virus and gotten sick instead of halted it before it makes you sick.

Though, Eli Lilly stopped donations to 1/6/21 Insurrectionist supporting Republican politicians and Regeneron's CEO donates democrat, so it may take a real investigative journalist to find out...Or maybe it is just the desire to be saved from the consequences of bad decisions about health (made as part of a reflex social-political posture) and pulled back from the brink of death, something we do for our patients all the time.  Kind of a monoclonal ""Indulgence"" for those stuck in the medieval mindset.

Be well and stay safe,

2021-09-18 17:29:46,And the infusions do nothing to slow the emergence of new variants.  My remedy would be to make vaccination a prerequisite of infusion.
2021-09-18 17:30:06,"Aren't the lies regarding the dangers of the covid vaccines being constantly spread by ""conservative"" talk show hosts the equivalent of yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded movie theater.  

And aren't these widespread lies even more dangerous than shouting ""Fire!"", as they not only result in the taking of many more lives, but also clog up hospitals, run up healthcare costs for everyone, prevent the economy from fully recovering, and continue to put us all at greater risk.

The US Supreme Court has clearly ruled more than once that speech that is dangerous and false is not protected, as opposed to speech that is dangerous but also true.

Why are the deadly lies spread all over the public airwaves and cable television networks by these right-wing hacks considered protected speech?  That goes against all judicial precedent."
2021-09-18 17:31:02,"Some conservative radio hosts and/or conservative influencers need to just tell the anti-vaccine crowd to self medicate at home with a big handful of ivermectin washed down with a nice cold glass of bleach.  Problem solved.  Too harsh, I know, but am so fed up with these people.  Progressives are just too darn accommodating."
2021-09-18 17:31:35,"While the expense of the treatment and the continued contagion are important issues, the diversion of personnel and resources away from those with urgent needs due to unpreventable conditions (trauma, cancer, heart disease...) is unconscionable. Regeneron developed the antibody treatment method prior to the development of the vaccine - there should be no need for it any longer. Suppose that there finally is a vaccine that prevents cancer. Will the same folks who refuse the COVID vaccine opt for chemotherapy  instead?"
2021-09-18 17:32:00,So the conservatives are making bad life decisions and relying on socialized medicine to save them from the consequences?
2021-09-18 17:32:08,"Well, it's nice that Republicans are finally backing a treatment that actually works, even if it is by accident.  But if you want antibodies that fight Sars-Cov-2, guess what, a vaccine gets your body to make its own antibodies, and you don't have to get sick first.  ""Don't get vaccinated, get treated later,"" makes no sense, especially when the majority of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are still unvaccinated.  All this to what, avoid giving Biden a win?  I will never get it."
2021-09-18 17:32:26,"It is clear that these people who are worried about vaccines, but will take the infusion in a heart beat - are living in a universe of disinformation.  They refuse to trust the information from people who actually know stuff (like their doctors); yet gobble up lies from Faux news (or worse) that have provided incorrect information again and again.  For those of us who don't live in the Faux news disinformation universe, it is mind-blowing.  

It is not like these antibodies are that effective.  Sure a lot of people who got them have recovered quickly - but so have a lot of people who didn't get them.  They are close to useless for hospitalized patients, of very limited help for vaccinated people (who already have antibodies) and somewhat helpful for unvaccinated people if given before serious symptoms."
2021-09-18 17:32:50,"Tell me again why the federal government is paying for this? Especially in those Southern states who supposedly disdain federal ""handouts""."
2021-09-18 17:32:53,"It must be wonderful to be able to rationalize contradictions so easily. Vaccine bad, antibody good. Do they believe that antibodies are free of risk? Created by their god instead of in a lab? Far more effective than a vaccine? 

Half of Americans live in some new dark age."
2021-09-18 17:33:22,Individuals who refuse vaccination and get Covid should get the antibody treatment to lessen the risk of severe infection and hospitalization--but they should have to pay! They refused vaccination because they calculated their personal risk to be non-existent and not worth the falsely perceived risk of vaccination. Now they want free  more expensive treatments. Vaccinated individuals who get breakthrough infection are another matter as they deserve the treatment at not cost. Another issue is that the government should reserve this treatment to first determine if the patient will recover without it which is likely to be the case as most who get Covid have mild symptoms. The un-vaccinated are fearful of getting really sick so they rush to a clinic but they should be charged. Their folly in refusing vaccination should not be on the taxpayers
2021-09-18 17:33:24,Why am I being forced to pay for a treatment for these anti vaxxers!? Let them pay for it. They claim to love their freedom. Freedom is never free.
2021-09-18 17:35:18,Further proof that refusing the vaccine has nothing to do with religious convictions or medical concerns.  It's just a way to show absolute fealty to Donald J. Trump.  Anti-vaxxers are just one of more dangerous manifestations of the Trump personality cult.
2021-09-18 17:36:06,"From the article, “The people you love, you trust, nobody said anything negative about it,” Mr. Jones said of the antibody treatment. “And I’ve heard nothing but negative things about the side effects of the vaccine and how quickly it was developed.”
Mr. Jones is the perfect example of why we are such dire straights in this pandemic. The thing is, I know, in his heart of hearts, he truly believes what he said. 
The Republicans, right wing and social media, are controlling the message."
2021-09-18 17:36:30,The interesting thing is that research on vaccines has been ongoing for decades.  Monoclonal antibodies according to the column is new.  Anti vaxers should be informed of this.
2021-09-18 17:39:53,"This makes me profoundly angry. If you have shunned the vaccine and get Covid, you do NOT deserve ANY help, treatment or hospital resources and beds. I’m tired of these ignorant adults acting like selfish children throwing a 2-years long temper tantrum. 

How many innocent people have these unvaccinated humans infected and possibly killed due to their ignorant defiance? How many people have they infected during their non-symptomatic phase; how many new and worse vaccine-resistant variants are they incubating in their unvaccinated bodies?

They should stay home and suffer the consequences of their individual rights and freedoms. If they don’t want to behave like responsible rational members of society, then they do NOT deserve the benefits of a society. Stay home and bootstrap it!"
2021-09-18 17:42:46,"Why are taxpayers paying $2100 for an infusion that only helps the recipient when a $20 vaccination protects the recipient and others?

Additionally, why should the infusions be largely given to red states like Florida who are anti-vaxxer and anti-maskers?

Let them pay for their own Cadillac treatments.  Anti-vaxxers should not be rewarded."
2021-09-18 17:43:51,New rule: They can't have the antibody treatment a second time unless they get the vaccine first.
2021-09-18 17:44:06,"All you need to know about the story (digested):
""monoclonal antibodies, a year-old, laboratory-created drug no less experimental than the vaccine... The federal government...covering the cost of the treatment — currently about $2,100 per dose ... seven Southern states accounting for 70 percent of orders...their governors, who have made the antibody treatment central to their strategy for enduring a catastrophic wave of the Delta variant... vaccine is $20 and could prevent almost all of that..."""
2021-09-18 17:45:22,"Another example of the absence of thinking skills in the USA. Another example of the deep political hatred that many in conservatives have for the left that makes the very future of the country questionable. 

The anti-bodies are recent science. The anti-bodies are synthetic. The anti bodies are not considered “political”. The people like the therapy because Trump took it. They like the therapy because Facebook said it’s ok. - vaccine shot is $20. This therapy is $2,000. 

Give me a break."
2021-09-18 17:46:27,"Monoclonal antibodies are not a wonder drug.  Data shows you need to treat 35-40 infected patients to prevent 1 hospitalization (this is a better way of looking at it than saying in the article ""70% reduction in hospitalization"" -- that is a relative risk reduction, not an absolute risk reduction.  The absolute risk reduction is around 3%).  

Realistically it takes at least 4 hours to get an infusion: two hours to get an assessment and results on a COVID test, then a 21-60min infusion, then another hour of observation, plus all the time in between to get registered, get an IV placed, get the IV removed, etc.

4hrs x 40 patients = 160 hrs of bed time, that's almost 1 week.  While COVID hospitalizations can be prolonged, many patients have about 1 week length of stay.  So it might not be worth it for a health system to invest 160hrs of staffing resources in treating 40 patients to prevent 1 hospitalization -- better to use those resources on the inpatient unit delivering care to truly ill patients.

Also while monoclonal antibodies appear to be safe, they are more experimental than vaccines -- much less research and no formal FDA approval, they are all under an EUA.  I wish there were some way to hold right wing media and social media companies liable the same way we hold physicians liable when bad things happen to patients.  Why can't we sue negligent media for malpractice?"
2021-09-18 17:46:32,"Amazing. No scientist here, but from what I've read it seems monoclonal antibodies are lab created proteins, kind of like the lab created messenger RNA vaccines.  Neither are products of Mother Nature.  And who's to say they both can't contain the same 'chip?'  Or whatever absurdities the anti-vaxers have come up with.

The mRNA vaccine messenger RNA degrades quickly in the body and disappears in a few days.  Monoclonal antibodies hang around for maybe a month or more, considerably longer than the vaccine RNA.

Until last month these treatments were being used under an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA, kind of like the vaccines.  Now we have a fully approved mRNA vaccine, but that seems to have had less than anticipated impact on the anti-vaxers.  

This treatment is quite a bit more expensive than the vaccines.  So of course the Trumpians want them.  Why pay less for prevention when you could pay more for treatment.  The American medical industry in a nutshell, pun intended."
2021-09-18 17:46:36,Americans who don't want to prevent disease but what a quick fix when they do get sick?
2021-09-18 17:49:38,"As always, the “personal freedom” gang will tout the virtues of independent thinking while gobbling up shared resources at the first sign of distress. In this case, these selfish individuals are taking up precious ICU beds and an EUA approved treatment that will course through their bloodstream by way of IV for over an hour and costs magnitudes more than the fully approved vaccine. 

I believe hospitals should start rationing care for the unvaccinated in favor of people who have actually done the right thing. Personal freedom comes with implications and consequences. It’s time for those implications to be more fully apparent."
2021-09-18 17:50:23,Federal funding should cease for monoclonal antibodies treatment. Certainly shouldn't be giving it to the southern states since they don't like anything about the federal government. These people clamoring for monoclonal antibodies treatment need to put their money where there mouth is - they are all about freedom. Then pay! Health care is all about the most effective on the widest scale. That architect who wants to do the monoclonal antibody treatment again if he gets Covid is displaying ridiculous thinking. Go for prevention not treatment - he should be able to afford it without heaven forbid - relying on socialism.
2021-09-18 17:50:45,"This is enraging. Of course we should have treatment available to those who need it but this is like everything wrong with US healthcare provision and our overall culture in a nutshell. Every person for the themself? Who cares about anyone else! Where is there any semblance of collective care?? I don’t understand the logic of being anti-vaccine but having faith in other equally new treatments. How can there be no concern for overall resources, prevention, and life?"
2021-09-18 17:50:48,"The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission should investigate who has significantly invested in companies that manufacturer and distribute monoclonal antibodies in the last 18 months...

If a criminal threatened us, or our family's safety with a weapon what would you do? And yet every time the vector leaves the confines of it's home, they pose a danger to all of us with their weapon-their breath. Its time to mandate the vaccines for all and for those who don't want to ""eat their peas,"" have THEM be the ones who stay in a quarantine purgatory and release the rest of us hostages from the shackles of their ignorance and selfishness."

2021-09-18 18:05:12,"This does rather seem like closing the barn door after the horses have fled.  If your government only funded the vaccine and made those who chose to get sick, (and then sicken everyone else) have to pay for treatment after the fact, perhaps it would encourage more to get the preventative vaccine.  Perhaps not, but providing this treatment free appears to give a ‘get out of jail’ card to those who are clogging up your hospitals and in essence, prolonging the pandemic."

2021-09-18 18:10:46,"The focus on monoclonal antibodies often ignores certain reasons why this will never be the answer to the COVID pandemic. Most basically, this treatment is appropriate for only a small percentage of those infected with the corona virus.

 As this article reminds us, the infusions must be given within 10 days of the onset of symptoms; they are unhelpful to most hospitalized patients; receiving the antibodies once does not keep people from becoming seriously ill if they catch the virus again later. In other words, there is a short window of time during which they may help, but they are not indicated for very seriously ill patients, & they won't prevent symptoms if you contract the virus in the future.  All things considered, they are destined to give brief & limited help to a tiny percentage of COVID cases, but are of no use to the vast majority of people who are infected. 

 In contrast, a vaccination enables any person to reduce their risk of serious symptoms (or death) from COVID by close to 99%, in much less time,  with much smaller risk, & at a much lower cost.  Obviously, it makes more sense to get vaccinated than to pin your hopes on monoclonal antibodies.
Hear that, vaccine refuseniks?"

So those of us who are vaccinated, who may become infected by someone not vaccinated, may not have access to the monoclonal antibodies because the selfish anti-vaxers are using it all? And while they are clogging up the hospitals getting their cocktail and exposing essential workers to even more illness, people having a heart attack or needing cancer treatments are being turned away from hospitals. These ridiculous people no longer deserve to benefit from our sense of fairness, and should be dealt with punitively by forcing them to pay for their own treatment. The sooner the better.

I will never forget sitting in the Freeman Coliseum, (where I went to receive the treatment here in San Antonio), and looking at an entire side of empty partitions while listening to the nurses express their wishes that more people would avail themselves of this amazing treatment. They had seen the horrors of overcrowded hospitals and knew the physical and emotional pain of extreme exhaustion.  

As the entire process takes about 3 hours, there is ample time to visit.  

My neighbor, (a cancer survivor), said she was ashamed to be there. I was astonished and asked her why. Her reply: “Due to past medical problems, my doctor has told me I cannot get the vaccine. I have had so many angry people say unkind things,—I just feel ashamed.” She had an anxiety attack during her infusion.  

I told her COVID has come for the vaccinated & unvaccinated,—and while I had planned to nap through my treatment, I ended up talking her through it.

2021-09-18 18:36:22,"Emergency approval is based on an evaluation of the adverse event risks vs benefits.  The vaccines are essentially risk free and have huge documented benefits.  The monoclonal antibodies have documented some benefits to people in early stages of Covid-19, with a much higher (thought still acceptable) risk of adverse events than the vaccine.  There is no scientific rationale for refusing the vaccine, yet accepting these infusions."

Even more aggravating is that many of these folks decry the social safety net when it is truly helping those in need but seem not to realize how much they benefit from it themselves. As an aside, what is up with the spineless politicians who won’t vote for our national health programs to negotiate lower drug prices? Any other big purchaser would be able to use its purchasing power to secure better deals from big pharma. Good grief."

Why couldn’t there be information sent home with the patient educating on how monoclonal antibodies work, how and when they were developed and include the immunizations as well!  Surely some are bound to take it in and share it. 
One of the frustrating things about this article is the patient. He is obviously a smart, educated man to be in his position. He has the ability, as we all do, to do his own research instead of listening to “trusted advisers” that are not scientists.

Hoarders like Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg and Google's parent company took and continue to take advantage of these people for no other reason than to make a buck. To do this they show them (and you) the content that will keep eyeballs on the screen scrolling YouTube.

 Whether that content incites insurrection, handicaps the vaccine rollout, or calls our most sacred institutions into question doesn't matter. All that matters is the dollar. Even Donald Trump is only tangentially responsible for this.

The riches egoistes are the responsible party. Save your contempt for them rather than poor people whose basic social instincts are being taken advantage of to satisfy the hoarders. Algorithmic content curation in the hands of these people and companies and subject only to the profit motive is the source of our current epistemology crisis.

Sorry but there is something wrong with this picture. Many  ""antivaccers"" may have no insurance and the government has to fork out $2,100 per dose while it would only cost $20 for the vaccine which the government would happily pay.

Monoclonal antibodies are fantastic but there are other early treatments out there too. Normally with an outbreak of disease many different treatments are tried. But in this case all we had was people being sent home with Tylenol until they were deathly ill and came back to be put on a respirator. I find the whole situation entirely weird and I’m waiting for things to clear out so we can get a better picture of what was really going on here with such an unusual standard of (non) care.

People presenting with heart attacks, strokes, or appendicitis, etc are apparently being denied care in hospitals with a full ICU ward. Is this really so? Doctors are saying that their triage process favors those most likely to survive. Is an unvaccinated person who has been on a ventilator for weeks more likely to survive than a  person suffering a heart attack—assuming the heart attack patient gets immediate care? I never thought I would think such a thing, much less write it in a NYT’s comment, but If it’s true that patients with true emergency care needs are sent away—why not just pull the plug on an unvaccinated patient tying up an ICU bed for weeks or months? Perhaps, if the vaccine hesitant understood they weren’t guaranteed ICU care, they would get their shots! (And, by the way, it would be helpful if journalists would stop using the term “elective” care for life-saving treatments that just aren’t for Covid.) I would be grateful if someone with legit info would tell me I’m wrong about the triage process—it would be a great relief."

2021-09-18 19:41:02,Monoclonal antibodies and Regeneron are only approved for emergency use and have not be thoroughly reviewed. No proof that they really prevent severe infection without double blind study like any other treatment. Nobody knows if there will be long term adverse effects from these treatments. No one knows if they will affect fertility in the future either. You have to get sick to try them and still could end up with complications from covid 19 and will not prevent you from getting reinfected in a few months. Will not prevent ARDS the condition that is killing most people. The vaccines can prevent infection and serious illness and death.

3.) *Lacked* full FDA approval
4.) Were hastily produced

Embrace the anybody treatment:
1.) Are proteins manufactured industrially, en masse
2.) Still don't have full FDA approval
3.) Radically novel, when compared to centuries old vaccine know-how
4.) Are exponentially more expensive up produce and administer

Given the facts, the anti-vaccine movement has no logical legs to stand upon, besides the age old tropes of libertarian hogwash.

The government and the economy are collective endeavors meant to promote collective prosperity of a people. Safe guarding individual rights is one of the key mandates for such collectives as there is no guaranteed propagation of such systems without individual rights. What constitutes such rights isn't the freedom to anything and everything one pleases.

We mandate traffic laws for greater good of the collective and we should mandate vaccinations as long as they are safe... and we already do. I think vaccine mandates are long due unless we're okay with upending the age of historically unparalleled human prosperity for the masses. Any future decline will not be limited to any categorical groups. Everyone will suffer, some more than the others, but there will be a price up be paid."

Mistrust like that is emotional,  so no logical reasons like the fact that both the vaccine and the treatment he believes in are both extraordinarily new. Even the more traditional J&J vaccine suffers because it is not fully approved (I don't think the monoclonal treatment is yet fully approved). There is no emotional dissonance. 

Why? I'm going with our social media bubbles driven by tribal politics in combination with an educational system that doesn't do a good job producing independent thinkers.

2021-09-18 20:35:47,It's very confusing to learn they are willing to take an experimental drug that was created using fetal cells.  I think that the government should not pay for this treatment if  unvaccinated people catch covid more than once.

2021-09-18 20:40:23,"Those who shun the vaccine should look up how monoclonal antibodies are produced in the lab:

""Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are produced by introducing an antigen to a mouse and then fusing polyclonal B cells from the mouse's spleen to myeloma cells. The resulting hybridoma cells are cultured and continue to produce antibodies to the antigen.""

""Such a hybrid cell is called a hybridoma. Artificial production of monoclonal antibodiesThe technique involves fusing certain myeloma cells (cancerous B cells), which can multiply indefinitely but cannot produce antibodies, with plasma cells (noncancerous B cells), which are short-lived but produce a desired antibody.""

How does that sound safer than a vaccine?
And are you the same people that complain that the government spends too much and taxes you for it?  Apparently monoclonal antibodies cost more than one hundred times as much as a vaccine, so just get the vaccine!  It's safe!

Of course if you aren't vaccinated, I don't think that you should be able to get monoclonal antibody treatment instead.  I don't think any one sick with Covid should even be allowed into the hospital without proof of a vaccine and should stay home to get better by yourself or die which ever you prefer."

Nevertheless, the federal government is paying 100 times as much for each of these treatments as for a single dose, and an individual like Mr. Jones is clearly able to pay for his own infusion. If he continues to refuse vaccination and relies on monoclonal antibodies as his first line of defense, he should pay the full cost.

As supplies run short, infusion centers should prioritize those most likely to be hospitalized--those over 65 and those with comorbidities. This prioritization may be necessary to avoid overwhelming ICUs."

His doctor was pushing for the shot, he said. But the monoclonal antibodies had worked so well that he was tempted to simply return for another infusion if he caught Covid-19 again.
“If I can go get an infusion and feel as good as I do right now, man, I’d rather not take a vaccine that has just been developed,” he said. “That makes me nervous, still.”
What an ignorant, self centered person. And apparently very proud of himself for it. I’m just gonna do the infusion as many times as I need and not do anything to prevent the need. American taxpayers are footing the bill for either the vaccine at $20 per dose with months of protection from disease or $2100 per dose for monoclonal antibodies that resolve one infection with no future protection against disease.
Self centered entitlement babies should not get free treatment. Anyone who refuses to be vaccinated and comes begging for monoclonal antibody treatment should be required to pay full price out of pocket. I am sick of footing the bill for the lazy American who thinks they are entitled to do whatever they want at the expense of everyone else. Financially and with regard to public health. All future treatments, full price, out of pocket."

No, vaccines are all different and the science is not the same as monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that are infused into the vein to soak up virus. A vaccine recruits your bodies intracellular ribosomes and at times nucleus to synthesize proteins to which your immune system reacts and sometimes over reacts. Things went sideways when people who had a hard time pronouncing new (to them) medical terms yet were voicing their opinions on the science and were being interviewed on TV. It all went bad including the politicization from wearing masks are a democrat thing to conducting an in-depth investigation of where the virus originated is a republican thing.

And it fits a related strategem of the GOP, not just at the individual level: It serves their goal of ""limited government"" just fine to find every means available of draining federal revenue for themselves so that there's no money left for programs to serve as not just ""safety nets"" but fundamental basics of life - safe water, food, education, health - they don't want those things for every American, only for themselves - and then, like the self-blinding hubris of a Clarence Thomas: ignore the federal help you got along the way, tell yourself you raised yourself by your own bootstraps, and then cut off the ladder below you so no one else can climb it as you did."

Together, they have opened dozens of state-sponsored sites where monoclonal antibody therapy is offered, holding regular news conferences to endorse the potentially lifesaving benefits, while continuing to resist wider public health measures such as mask mandates and vaccine passports.

Meanwhile, I've just gotten the answer to one of my many questions regarding MAB's and Covid.  So it's true, you CAN get Covid more than once !!  But other questions remain. How long is the protection from Covid using MAB's and are you still contagious after administration of MAB's ? Good to know it's great for treating the symptoms of a Covid infection.
I believe using MAB's instead of a vaccine is shortsighted at best. However, the downside to this, is the short  window of opportunity to use this treatment and the fact that hospitalized patients already on O2 cannot receive it.

Most doctors are not virologists or on top of what vaccines do and what masks do and if such doctors are giving advice then they are doing a great disservice. As far as the conservative radio hosts they don't know what they are talking about. 

What has been missing in the extreme politicization of the COVID pandemic is clear articulation of pros and cons of vaccines and why vaccines are the best option for those who have never been vaccinated before and never recovered from a severe COVID infection and acquired a robust immunity that could provide long-term protection. 

Monoclonal antibodies are to be administered only after a person has been infected or presumed exposed and they certainly could serve as a prophylaxis as opposed to prevention of severe infection. It is not as simple a procedure to deliver monoclonals as is a vaccine. The key difference is the possibility of adverse reaction will be fairly low with monoclonals than with a vaccine dose. An important difference of consequences is that monoclonals after a month of infusion are no longer effective where as vaccines could elicit an immune response that is longer lasting  and could be boosted if the levels fall off due to age or other immunodeficiencies."

2021-09-18 21:50:40,The government should be paying only for the infusions for people who are “hospitalized” the government should not be paying for an infusion for someone who does not have Covid. If someone wants an infusion and they do not have Covid they should be declined but if they are not they should have to pay cash.
2021-09-18 19:27:41,"There is a new monoclonal antibody currently being tested in the quantum leap iSpy Covid trials that could save the lives of intubated and desperately ill Covid patients.￼

It is called Narsoplimab, it was developed by Omeros Corp., and will most likely be approved for another indication within the next four weeks. It stops the runaway cytokine storm and blood clotting caused by Covid, and increased survival by quite a large percentage in smaller trials. It works by binding to and disabling￼ MASP2, the effector enzyme of the Lectin Pathway of Complement, which enables the cytokine storm that kills many Covid patients in the ICU. Hopefully everyone will know about it soon￼."
2021-09-18 21:52:48,"So many commenters treating science as a religion. Science in its purest form is about debate and controversy, rather than shut down concerns or worse, make fun of people. Vaccines are unfortunately not the panacea of ""solving"" COVID, so please don't act like it is. Yes, they have helped immensely in stemming severe disease and yes, they of course are effective most of the time in preventing disease in the first place, but no, they are not 100%. Even if 100% of the population were inoculated, it is impossible to get COVID under control unless people stop treating the vaccine as some sort of scientific deity. Wear masks, wash hands, avoiding massive gatherings, among other preventative steps  still have to be practiced, if we want to get to 0 cases as Taiwan has after an outbreak. Let's be humble and take steps to prevent COVID, much like how it is much better to drive defensively despite the many bad drivers out there."

Monoclonals cost the taxpayer at least $2,100/dose, while the vaccine costs us about $40. One has to actually GET Covid before they get Monoclonal treatment, if they are even eligible for the treatment. 

The ONLY reasons that these people are  not getting vaccinated are 2:
1. Pure ignorance, (see Niki Minage's cousin's friend)
2. Hatred of anything Democrats support and an overwhelming desire to ruin anything that helps the American people, unless they wear Red Hats.

They are taking a handout with the hard earned dollars of others when they didn’t lift their sleeve for a vaccine. 

They are receiving a welfare handout. 

And what they are receiving, at no cost to themselves, is a form of socialized medicine. 

They are benefitting from the willingness of their fellow Americans to care for one another while demonstrating the depths of their selfishness in the face of a public health crisis. 

So I say, from here on out, if you didn’t get a vaccine when you could have gotten one, the taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for your treatment of COVID. You are sick because you shunned science. You and your insurance company can figure out how to pay for your care. 

You didn’t sacrifice anything for the common good. You can start paying for your selfishness."

I suspect far, far fewer have gotten the antibodies, but yet the vaccine is somehow more experimental? Also, what trials did this therapy go through and for how long? Do we know the long term side effects of this new, lab-grown treatment? Finally, since the antibodies are most effective at a certain time, how many people received them and still died? Or wanted them and weren't eligible and died? Plus, the astronomical cost difference. Good Lord! How does THIS make more sense than a vaccine??"

2021-09-18 22:10:33,"When the autopsy of this pandemic is done, years from now, one of the great tragedies that will be made clear is all the lives that could have been saved had monoclonal antibodies been used to their fullest potential, before vaccines were generally available  last spring.   For nearly a year now, monoclonals have had an EUA.  Since then, they have been available to people over the age 65 and people over the age of 12 who are at high risk and who have tested positive, but have not been admitted to the hospital.   These treatments might well have saved Trump's live.  Trump, however, received them while he was hospitalized, unlike regular people.  The people who have gotten these treatments are those who knew to seek them out.

Why Trump didn't make these more available is a real shame.  Why DeSantis didn't see the light on monoclonals last fall and start the push to use them, then, is also a shame.  Why didn't Fauci do more to encourage the use of monoclonals?  Of all the really tragic and frustrating things that have occurred during this pandemic, this is one of the worst.  DeSantis is doing now what should have been done last fall by all of those in power.  Tens of millions of these doses should have already been made and used before the vaccines were widely available."

Monoclonal antibodies are a booming niche for pharma. They can be very effective, BUT MANY PATIENTS MAKE ANTIBODIES TO TARGET THE INFUSED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES. 
I made antibodies to medication I received. During my second infusion I developed chest tightness and difficulty breathing. I was then tested to see if I had made antibodies to the monoclonal antibodies. 
This happens so often that tests are already created to see if patients have created antibodies to the antibodies.

Is their objective to create division and hate? Also in this article two important points are missed. First, being vaccinated reduces but does not prevent you spreading the virus. The dominant benefit of the vaccine is that significantly reduces the chance the vaccinated person from getting severely ill and thus being hospitalized by a factor of eight or more depending on the study. Monoclonal antibodies are given early in the Covid infection to prevent severe illness which will aldo reduce hospitalization. So in terms of reducing the number of Covid hospital patients both vaccines and monoclonal antibodies work.

I swear to you: we are living in the world of the triumph of insanity.  

Let's see, now.

The monoclonal antibody drugs are _just as experimental_ as the vaccine drugs.  The monoclonal antibody drugs have saved a few tens of thousands of lives?  Perhaps a hundred thousand lives?  There is a limited window for administrating the monoclonal antibody drugs once a patient becomes infected.  The treatment resolves the condition of the one patient it is administered to.  Each dose is at least 10 times as expensive as a dose of the vaccine.  The drug confers no immunity to the disease in the patients it is used to treat.  But it does work well for the patients to whom it is administered.

Meanwhile millions of persons have been vaccinated fully and the number of adverse side effects or adverse occurrences arising from vaccination are so few as to be almost unnoticeable.  The vaccines are far cheaper per dose, and confers long-lasting immunity.  Each vaccinated person protects not just himself, but all others with whom he comes into contact.

There is _far more_ data on the vaccines (simply as a result of the sheer number of doses administered) than on the monoclonal antibodies.  Yet people don't trust the vaccines!?!?

Jeez, man.  GET THE VACCINE ALREADY!"

But now that these same minority groups are STILL being hospitalized at a higher rates than whites, AFTER the vaccines have been out for months, we are supposed to ignore percentages and instead switch over to looking at total hospital beds because to do otherwise would highlight an inconvenient weakness to your argument.

Got it.

Or: you can sit under an IV stand, and have short-lived antibodies designed to work best with the particular human cells that made them, and receive something you’re already hospitalized with COVID, in most cases because you didn’t bother vaxing. Treatment might just, if you lucky keep you from dying of a preventable disease.
At a cost of a hospital stay, because you’re going downhill.
Monoclonals are a potential damper for COVID that carry assorted risks of allergies to the chemicals used in their manufacture and transportation (they must be used quickly, or they die).
Made from a soup of undifferentiated cells, generally obtained a decade ago from cells from an aborted embryo,  in growth media that turns them into antibody-producing cells. Then they’re programed  with about the same mRNA used in COVID vaccine.
The cells in the soup produce generalized human COVID antibodies; the one the vax would have programmed your own cells to make would have been tuned to your body, not the “generic human” cells in the soup, filtered, concentrated and delivered with a liter of saline.

Intravenous infusions of monoclonal antibodies are not risk-free. So I would like to remind people like Mr. Jones, who are considering forgoing the vaccine &, instead, just drop in for a government-paid-for $2000 monoclonal antibody infusion every time they are exposed to Covid-19:
1.Vaccines are completely FDA approved
2.Vaccines are more effective at preventing Covid-19 disease, & especially severe disease, than monoclonal antibodies are at treating it
3.Monoclonal antibodies help you & only you, contributing nothing to the safety of your neighbors or family members
4.Vaccines protect you & your community
5.Your risk of contracting Covid-19 after being vaccinated is tremendously reduced
6.Your risk of contracting Covid-19 after receiving monoclonal antibodies is probably the same as the risk for an unvaccinated person contracting Covid-19, & is probably greater than the risk for someone who recovered from it naturally
7. Each monoclonal antibody infusion carries the risk of potentially life-threatening complications, & may not even be effective when used repeatedly

The truth is that monoclonal antibodies are safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19, but there is not enough available for everyone who could benefit from it.  I am vaccinated (and believe vaccination is also safe) and qualify for monoclonal antibodies if I were to contract COVID-19 because I am immune-compromised.

What is scandalous here is that we’ve had this life-saving treatment for covid since last fall, yet it has been hush-hush with doctors refusing to prescribe it and hundreds of thousands of people being told to go home and just take Tylenol. They just let people die all winter when the monoclonal antibodies were sitting on shelves. It was kept secret that this life-saving medicine exists, and someone has to be truthful and say it straight: the point is that Régénéron brings covid mortality to ZERO, not that it reduces hospitalizations by 70 percent. The outrageous thing is not that some stupid people didn’t get the vaccine. The outrageous thing is that doctors and hospitals refused for months to administer this life-saving treatment, and essentially let so many people die, when the data was already out there that monoclonal antibodies work."
2021-09-19 04:50:57,"There are no cures for Covid. Get vaccinated now to be prepared. Monoclonal antibodies may help if you get Covid and belong to a high-risk group, but it's still best to have been fully vaccinated in advance, even if your state prioritizes the unvaccinated for scarce monoclonal antibody treatments as Utah does. Vaccines reduce hospitalization and death rates by a larger factor; they are better protection and there's no uncertainty about being able to get them."
2021-09-19 04:54:50,"I find it despicable that a third or so of the US population refuse to get a safe, effective, vaccine, doing great harm to all of us, prolonging and worsening the pandemic, straining hospitals and causing breakthrough infections in the vaccinated elderly and then feel entitled to a $2,000 treatment at public expense. And that governors and other Republican leaders push it as a substitute for the vaccine. This is the height of selfishness and irresponsibility.  The monoclonal antibodies should be reserved primarily for the vaccinated elderly and others at risk who got breakthrough infections through no fault of their own. The treatment is no safer than the vaccines and arguably less effective, and unlike vaccination helps only the individual."
2021-09-19 08:07:46,"Over here in Singapore, in Asia, 90% of the population over the age of 12 has been fully vaccinated, almost all with the Pfizer vaccine. Mask wearing is both mandatory and ubiquitous, with handwashing being scrupulously followed.

Yet, as of today, daily infections are approaching an all time high and still rising rapidly. 

80% of those infected are fully vaccinated. 

We'll soon match the United States and the UK in per capita infections, two of the worst affected large populations.

The only saving grace, and lesson for all of you over there is that vaccinated victims of Covid-19 are hospitalized at about one-tenth the rate of the unvaccinated.

Get your shots over there, folks."
2021-09-19 08:22:16,"It's hard to understand, to even fathom really, that getting infected and hoping for a therapeutic cure makes more sense to people than preventive medicine.

And the ignorance - there is really no other word for it - of people like Mr. Jones who can say something so irrational as:

“The people you love, you trust, nobody said anything negative about it,” Mr. Jones said of the antibody treatment. “And I’ve heard nothing but negative things about the side effects of the vaccine and how quickly it was developed.”

If he opened his ears, and listened to a healthcare provider, he might have actually heard a lot about the adverse events and risks involved in the infusion therapy.  BTW did he ask about how quickly the monoclonal Ab was developed and that (I think) it's being given under an EUA.  I guess he thinks the vaccine was developed by ""Big Pharma"" but the monoclonal Ab came from the Keebler elves.

From what I know, giving someone  2 vaccinations cost the U.S. Govt. (us)  from  $40-$60. The article says the infusion doses are more like $ 2100 and that doesn't take into account that more than one dose might be given or that the actual treatment cost way exceeds that when you take into account the staffing, procedure room, and all the other charges that get billed. 

This NYT article would be a whole lot better if it also laid out the quantitative reality, in dollars and cents, the cost of  the prevention (vaccine) versus the therapeutic intervention approach."

2021-09-19 10:39:58,"One thing the article didn't report: Some people with chronic conditions unrelated to Covid, for example certain autoimmune diseases, have been getting periodic MAB infusions for years to manage their diseases.  Because of the sudden demand for these medications to treat seriously ill Covid patients--almost all of them unvaccinated--these meds are in short supply and are disrupting treatment for others who have depended on them for years. 

In my case, a medication (tocilizumab) that I have taken by infusion every month for eleven years, became unavailable.   The good news: My rheumatologist found an effective alternative that I self-inject at home.  The bad news: While my monthly infusion was covered 100% by Medicare in combination with my supplemental private insurance plan, the ""workaround"" treatment comes with a monthly copay of $1,244.  

While we are all affected by anti-vaxers' selfish refusal to do their part to help tamp down Covid, some of us are hit squarely in the pocketbook.  Grrrr."

If we are going to stop this pandemic, people have to get vaccinated. Ameliorating the impact of the illness is not enough. 
It's not really about the cost. The key is that we need communities of immunized people to act as barriers to the spread of COVID and opportunities for the virus to evolve. 
If people refuse to get vaccinated, they should be required to isolate themselves. That's only a temporary barrier to COVID, but it would help stop community spread. 
Unfortunately, the crazies have taken over. No masks. (Unmask our children!) Freedom!!! to go to bars, churches, stores and other public venues.

No. Just no.

You are spending $2100/dose of our tax dollars to treat unvaccinated individuals with monoclonal antibodies, but you control the distribution of antibody treatment?

Please turn off the faucet.  I have absolutely no training in medicine and very little in science, but I do know a waste of money when I see it.  Monoclonal antibody treatment may have a place in treating those with the virus, but it should be reserved for those who are already fully vaccinated unless they have some underlying condition which medically prevents them from doing so, as opposed to a 'belief' that vaccinations are unsafe.    

Apparently, this might be the hammer that would knock some sense into those who choose to believe the internet over every doctor with basic competency."
2021-09-19 12:26:43,"More of the typical hypocrisy that we put up with from the Conservatives/Republicans.

If you refused to be civically responsible and get vaccinated, you should be denied insurance coverage for treatments for covid.

If you refused to be civically responsible and get vaccinated, you should be placed at the bottom of waiting lists for treatments, so that other people with life-threatening illnesses aren't denied accesss to hospitals and doctors.

States should be paying for expensive covid treatments, not the federal government.  I'm tired of my elitist blue-state tax dollars saving the lives of people who openly profess hatred for me."

DeSantis doesn't care because he is fully vaccinated.  Donald Trump doesn't care because he received both the vaccine and the monoclonal antibodies treatment.   On the home front, my niece's live in boy friend (50 years old) and receiving on-going treatment for cancer, adamantly refused to be vaccinated stating ""I don't believe the vaccine works,"" ""it's all a hoax,"" and "" I am not a lab rat,"" among other fabricated rationalizations, did get Covid and had no problem heading straight to the emergency room to receive the monoclonal treatment, fully paid for by the State of Florida and the US taxpayers.

2021-09-19 12:42:32,"The coronavirus vaccinations have been given to hundreds of millions of people so how are they experimental.

Monoclonal antibodies are more experimental and are costing the taxpayers more.

Giving the monoclonal antibodies are also causing vaccinated people to be discriminated against. The antibodies are given at the beginning of contracting the coronavirus; therefore hospitals are reluctant to give them to vaccinated people because they don’t  expect their symptoms to worsen.  So by taking precautions in getting vaccinated, you are denied the most beneficial treatment for those who failed to get vaccinated."

The shingrix shots hurts so can I take an anti-body treatment at the government's expense.  Stop catering to the it's not fda approved, has been tested long enough, was made too fast, I will get a stroke, heart attack and more from a vaccine.

I needed prostate surgery that was preventing me from using the restroom. The problem was solved through putting a catheter in my bladder. The doctor informed me that my surgery could be delayed due to the coronavirus patients. The doctor explained that I could live the rest of my life with a catheter which to him made prostate removal an elective surgery. 

Fortunately, a bed opened up because I wanted a return to normal not walking around with a tube in my bladder.

I wonder how many more people with serious ailments are being denied surgery because the ailment/condition can be put off with a temporary measure while vaccination deniers are treated as emergency cases."

And the drunk anti-vaxxers, the Lanson Joneses amongst us, make their choice knowing that someone else, some other group, will have to clean up their mess after they end up in a hospital and maybe an ICU. Or pay for their costly and time- and facility-consuming antibody treatment (from insurance pools or government handouts). It’s a kind of health welfare for people who refuse to or can’t make rational choices about healthcare, and in their solipsistic fog can’t recognize that Covid is a public health issue. No one lives in a bubble."

These people apparently hate me so much that the GOP had to appease them by lowering my SALT deduction because they shouldn’t subsidize my ‘elaborate lifestyle’ in my blue state.  Who cares that my blue state subsidizes them. 

So here we are yet again reading about the anti-vaxxers.  What are they thinking? What can we do to change their minds?  They’re taking up hospital beds and ERs.  Costing us millions through Medicare and Medicaid payments and eventually through higher insurance premiums.  I am so tired of this!  Three cheers for Delta Airlines for surcharging the unvaccinated on insurance premiums.

At what point can ‘society’ move on without those who refuse to participate in society?  In most places non-smokers do not have to be subjected to the health risks from second hand smoke anymore.  No smoking inside in public places.   This seems to be a good model to protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated.  Pay for your own crack pot therapies and stay home."

He needs to pay, out of pocket for all of this. If he gets sick again he needs to be at the back of the line for a bed if the hospitals are full. The lack of critical thinking is exhausting and infuriating. Almost 160 million people have been vaccinated - explain how this is experimental any more.

2021-09-19 14:07:55,"First of all, our taxes are paying for this $2100.00 Regeneron or Lilly infusion given to people who refuse to be vaxed. Another excuse to not get vaxed.

The other part of this equation is if you are unvaxed, then get this EXPENSIVE treatment, you are protected from re-infection maybe a month. AND if you were unvaxed, got this treatment, you cannot receive the vaccinations for 90 days after completion of infusion or the 4 shot subQ. 

So, hey America, we will still have these unvaxed zombies roaming among us. How to stop this excuse to not get vaxed? 

1.Require they sign a contract that they will get the vax once they reach the 90 days and agree to follow-up tracing that they do get the vax. 

2. Charge THEM a fee for using hospital or out patient resources that can be used for those elective procedures which are starting to be canceled due to overwhelmed hospitals.

3. Even though government is paying for the drug, in most cases the administration/labor to administer it is charged to insurance companies which increases everyone's health care insurance.

4. Regeneron and Lilly need to back off of their pricing and provide it free on a compassionate type use. OUR TAXES ARE PAYING FOR THE UNVAXED TO HAVE AN EXCUSE.

5. Call Dr. Death DiSantis to get the treatment since one of his biggest money backers has lots of stock in Regeneron. Am sure he will kowtow to your request for treatment.

There are few studies exploring the risk of antibodies to  healthy volunteers, which vary from 1:425 adverse events to a low of 1:100,000. Risk for COVID 19 vaccines appear to be about 2-5 adverse events per million, perhaps less. A sore arm is not an adverse event, someone can also become sore from playing softball with the kids or carrying groceries. Taking the COVID vaccine is less risky than ordinary life. Monoclonal antibodies are not an over the counter vitamin, but a drug that can also kill. The media needs to tell the truth about monoclonal antibodies push and back against disinformation."

They accept the benefits of other people's wise and civic-minded behavior while feeling no compunction to reciprocate.

More on topic, nobody seems to focus on a common risk of monoclonal antibody treatment, that of IV infection and bacteremia. That happened to me and it's no fun.

They might consider that the Pfizer vaccine has been approved not only by our own FDA, but also by the World Health Organization and drug approval agencies in advanced countries around the world."
2021-09-19 16:58:16,"So covidiots are scrambling for a hugely-subsidized (and new) technology that benefits only them, and reject a long-developed (but recently distributed) vaccine that has been ""tested"" on hundreds of millions of people, is free, easy to get, and protects the individual AND society at large. 

Naked narcissism shouldn't be rewarded with a free pharma ride. If covidiots want to treat expensive MCAs like over-counter cold remedies they should pay the shot. And if they are in short supply, they should be reserved only for vaxxed people with breakthrough infections."
2021-09-19 17:00:08,So vanity turns out to be one of the reasons people don't vaccinate for COVID. I'm sure these suckers for disease feel even smugger when they receive a $2K experimental treatment that could've been prevented with a $20 fully authorized vaccine.
2021-09-19 17:00:58,The simple solution is to deny free treatment to anyone who has refused vaccine.  Society can no longer condone and pay for their antisocial behavior.
2021-09-19 17:03:24,"One thing is clear, there is absolutely no miracle drug that can fix the irony in how people, like Mr Jones, make decisions.  As a nurse (now retired) some of my family and friends used to respect my advice. Now they listen to the internet experts that they find on their social pages. 

I heard one today that almost had me convinced vaccines were interfering in the immunological process. But I vaguely remembered some schooling that made me seek out the 'institute' the video originated from and I found that the clip had been taken totally out of context and mischaracterized in the introduction.  

My nursing logic was proven correct.  So, I posted my finding on the comment page but I've learned one major thing during this pandemic, that there's no miracle cure for wilful ignorance."
2021-09-19 17:04:57,"Two things I'd love to see:

1. With the exception of those who can't be vaccinated or for whom vaccinations provide little protection - like the immunocompromised - patients receiving the antibody treatments should pay a substantial part of the $2,100 cost. Why should taxpayers have to foot the bill for those who refused the $20 vaccines?

2. Develop an mRNA therapy that codes for the antibodies so that the recipients' own cells produce the antibodies. Perhaps that way the antibodies can be introduced via one or more standard injections rather than expensive infusions. Of course the development/testing timeline would likely make this approach impractical for this pandemic - but it sure would put those irrationally opposed to mRNA vaccines in a twist."
2021-09-19 17:13:42,"Does Jones ask his doctor for architectural engineering advice? Then what's with him not getting vaccinated as recommended by his doctor (and the CDC)?? Having received help in combatting COVID with foreign antibodies, he can't say his immune system was fully challenged. And his immune system is likely now programmed to combat the Regeneron antibodies, which might reduce their effectiveness and make him sicker in a different way--on top of having COVID again. Even if he doesn't feel sick the next time he gets COVID, he'll be more likely to spread it to others if he's not vaccinated. This guy is a walking disaster."
2021-09-19 17:22:56,"Whenever these drugs are described at length, as in this article, it should be noted that during testing, researchers at Regeneron used a cell line that was ""derived in 1973 from the kidney of an aborted human embryo of unknown parenthood,"" according to the original research publication. This is research many of the people who are demanding these drugs would have banned entirely. That fact is essential context to any full discussion of the issue."
2021-09-20 11:00:20,"Covid will not be eradicated. We will transition from pandemic to endemic (like all Covid or flu viruses). We were able to eradicate Smallpox through vaccines (well after, not during that pandemic) because that virus had no animal hosts. By vaccinating during a pandemic, we’re prolonging the transition to endemic. We’ll be in this pandemic through the end of 2023, at which point natural immunity will reach critical mass (herd immunity). Between now and then we’ll be chasing variants (and votes) with boosters and mandates."

2021-09-20 11:47:08,As much as I want a booster shot I understand the importance of getting vaccines to places that have little or no supplies of them like Africa which has the potential of spinning out new more deadly variants if vaccination levels remain low there.

Now Biden is trying to pressure India to resume exports even though less than 50% of its population has not gotten the vaccine. At the same time, Biden is not allowing any exports of vaccines that are stockpiled in the US. The CDC reports that the US has 82 MILLION doses stockpiled. This number doesn't even include doses sent to the states. We're still making AstraZeneca shots that won't even be used. Before Biden tries to act as a world leader, maybe he should lead by example. Very dissapointed in his foreign policy."
2021-09-20 10:46:39,"Two points:
1. Manufacturing is a first, critical path step. Overlooked in this article is distribution, AKA getting the vaccine into arms. 
2. The world needs to boycott the EU in particular & the US for dragging out approval for relaxing patent protections for vaccine manufacturers. 
It is so very clear that the Covid pandemic is a global threat to humankind and it is equally clear that global leaders and their populations are feckless when it comes to dealing with global issues that threaten everyone’s survival. Climate change activities give us little reason for optimism on cooperation on any level but verbal posturing. 

Looks like it will be a very sad century."
2021-09-20 10:53:52,"The idea that vaccinating the whole world will stop the virus is very misleading.  The statement in this article that the rampant spread of the Delta variant and potentially thousands of others that are on the rise point to the futility of trying to vaccinate the entire world.  To think that variants will some how be just stopped in their tracks thru widespread vaccination is fantastical thinking.  Already, break through cases infecting the vaccinated illustrate just how difficult it is to stop the spread and replication of the corona virus.  People point to the success of stopping the polio virus but this comparison is erroneous as the polio virus is not the corona virus.  In addition, corona viruses infect the animals we eat which also serve as a reservoir for mutant viruses to jump species and enter the human population.  Some scientists feel vaccinations could lead to a trajectory of more virulent viruses taking hold,  as the corona viruses natural evolution properties will eventually evade any vaccine many can devise."

2021-09-20 11:59:25,"It should be clear at this point that there is little chance of herd immunity.  

Delta has proven that, beyond any doubt, as breakthrough cases and asymptomatic transmission are too large to ignore.  What we can do with global vaccination is to significantly reduce the burden on the world's medical systems and the death toll of Covid 19. 

Two things that are not clear are whether Covid 19 mutations will continue to dominate the future course of the disease and whether Long Haul Covid will remain a prominent and permanent aspect of its impact on the domestic and global populations.

2021-09-20 11:26:49,"As usual in an advocacy piece, the elephant in the room was completely ignored.  Vaccine hesitancy is far higher in the developing world than even the South of the US.  I have friends who got the vaccine in Armenia where they are throwing away doses despite the fact that less than 1/4 of the population is vaccinated.  Moreover, shouldn't the issue at hand be fatality rates and not income levels.  The US is losing 2,000 persons a day because of our health demographics, we are not being greedy but putting doses where they are needed."

But the Delta variant has made that Bode choice even more negatively impacting 

Biden CDC head Rochelle Walensky is as corrupt and cowardly as Trump era CDC head Robert Redfield. Rochelle should resign or be fired.

2021-09-20 12:14:35,"President Biden and other world leaders must prevent intellectual property rights to vaccine production from interfering with ending this pandemic. Enable other counties to produce the vaccines they and world need.

2021-09-20 12:22:54,"""The push....will test Mr. Biden’s doctrine of furthering American interests by building global coalitions.""

Are we talking about jingoism or about ending the pandemic and global health inequity?   If we actually care about the health of people in the poorer countries, we would work WITH China and Russia to vastly increase global production and distribution.  A partnership between China, Russia, the EU, and the US/UK -- combining our vaccine technological know-how (and Russia's too) with China's immense manufacturing capacity -- would be the way to actually solve the problem.  

The term ""vaccine diplomacy"" is a euphemistic way of saying we should use vaccines as a weapon to further our geopolitical advantage, which is morally bankrupt and counterproductive to the goal of ending this scourge."
2021-09-20 13:13:04,"I had my doubts about Joe, but turns out that he has the makings of a great president. An international push on vaccine production is exactly what's needed. It's a humanitarian action with a great benefit, it's a non-military international action that may restore some faith in the US, and it will help the US by ensuring that world markets don't collapse.

The US should go further by building excess vaccine manufacturing capability. As Scott Gottlieb suggested on Face the Nation, the US was caught short on manufacturing capability, and this is unlikely to be the last pandemic.

Biden deserves credit for not wavering on his decision to leave Afghanistan in the face of pressure. He's pushing to increase our efforts against climate change and, hopefully, we'll see an infrastructure package and maybe a voting rights bill. 

The real test is whether he can avoid conflict with China. There will be increasing pressure to take a more active role in the defense of Taiwan, particularly from Tony Blinken who is a China hawk. Any assistance we give to Taiwan will be met by responses from China, escalating the situation. China appears willing to leave Taiwan alone as long as Taiwan doesn't push on the issue of sovereignty. If this delicate balance is disturbed, then the US will have an increasing presence in Taiwan. The status quo is fine for now. We don't need to be embroiled in a new war."
2021-09-20 13:16:43,"We’re on the verge of the most dangerous phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMO.

The longer that the global pandemic drags on, the more likely it will be that a variant will develop that bypasses the immunity that results from past infections or vaccination.  At that point, the vaccines will have to be redesigned and the vaccination campaign will have to be started over.  

In the early stages of the pandemic, natural selection favored variants that could spread more rapidly through non-immune populations.  With mixed populations that include both immune and non-immune people, we now face the nightmare scenario of variants generated in the non-immune population that can bypass the immunity that resulted from vaccination or infection by the original virus or its variants.  If we can get to global herd immunity before that happens, there will be much less viral replication since most people will be immune, suppressing formation of vaccine-resistant variants.  And, with global travel, the immune and non-immune populations don’t even have to be in the same place.

It’s essential that we get to global herd immunity quickly or we’re likely to be starting over."
2021-09-20 12:23:31,"COVID isn’t over, in the US or the world.
It’s killed 674K so far in the US, with another 2K every day.
It’s likely to get worse this winter, and the total number could reach 1M.
If it’s not defeated abroad, a new variant is likely to evolve, which may come back to infect the US.
President Biden’s #1 focus should be on defeating COVID, both in the US and abroad."
2021-09-20 12:45:06,"Biden needs to  try taking care of business in America before trying to be president of the world.  We sent all our manufacturing, including pharmaceuticals, to foreign countries which gave them jobs and money. Yet we still have to take of them? What happened to India being the vaccine maker to the world? 

We still don't have a universal healthcare or  a public option yet  workers are told to get back to work without a booster because WHO thinks we should give the vaccine to other countries. Workers are afraid to go to certain jobs because if they get sick they will get hit with huge copays and deductibles. Outbreaks at schools are spiraling and more workers have to stay home and quartintine with their kids which means more problems.

Yet Biden who deosn't have the guts to implement full vaccination without some lame get tested option somehow wants to preside over the world. Biden has one job, to be president of the United States, and he needs to do that right before worrying about other countries."
2021-09-20 12:59:12,"For months president Biden forbid the export of products needed to manufacture vaccins.

How hypocrite can one be."

Imagine that a European country is so desperate that it needs to get vaccines from a developing country with unsafe hygienic condition.
Uklraine should have already been helped.
There is also China, India, and Russia enjoying the view from their permanent seats at the UN and they are awash with vaccines. These countries should help Africa.
I hope that generosity is not only something expected from US, UK, and EU.

It will be at least a functional even if a manageable problem for years to come and the sooner everyone embraces that notion the sooner we can establish a new normal within it.

Continents like Africa will line up and it won't be to protest.
2021-09-20 15:18:12,"In a latest development, India has lifted the ban on vaccine exports. Of course, their government which faced a lot of criticism from domestic and foreign media for exporting vaccines before meeting domestic needs will have to balance their needs with how Much they can export. Ironically, developed countries are now pushing for booster shots while pressuring countries like India to open exports before fully vaccinating their population. But that’s how the global politics works. “America is back” only after “America First”."
2021-09-20 14:50:43,"One aspect about ""share the vaccines""  that is rarely if ever taken into account is the infrastructure needed to successfully do so, especially the need for very deep temperature storage (at or below -70 C) for the mRNA vaccines, the main type we use in the US and other highly industrialized countries. That very cold storage can either be short-term by dry ice (for transportation) or in so-called ultrafreezers, which are much colder than any freezer we might have at home. Many of the countries that don't have enough vaccine don't have enough of those setups, and even if we would ship several thousand of these machines to them, these ultrafreezers also need highly reliable power (electricity); again not a given in many (most?) of these places. Plus, ultrafreezers don't work well or for long if the room they are operated in isn't climate controlled.  Thus, all these ""experts"" who complain about us not sharing our vaccines are either ignorant of these requirements, or chose not to talk about them.  The notion of making sure the entire world has access to vaccines is spot on, but the devil is indeed in the details. I have yet to hear a single one of these ""experts"" speak about those, which makes me put them in quotation marks."

2021-09-20 16:59:58,"Is it a NYT rule that our withdrawal from Afghanistan must be decried in every NYT article that mentions Biden?  Our withdrawal from Afghanistan was overwhelmingly supported by the American people.  We carried out the largest airlift in history, evacuating over 120 thousand  people.  Calling this accomplishment ""calamitous"" in an article about global vaccination makes me suspect that even if we exceed our highest goals in vaccinating the world, the press will call it a failure.

This piece treats global vaccination as our problem to fix (I agree we should take the lead, as we are), paired with a consistent denigration of our will and ability to do so.  President Biden supports intellectual property waivers, but unnamed ""advocates"" are said to feel he is not supporting hard enough.  The article fails to mention that, waiver or no waiver, very few facilities in the world have the ability to manufacture mRNA vaccines.  

The logistical problems of scaling up manufacturing capacity are immense.  Millions of doses have been ruined even in this country by a Trump-chosen contractor.  Tens of millions of doses have been ruined globally by facilities merely packaging manufactured vaccine into vials.   This is a hard problem to fix.  The distribution of doses is another problem that many countries are ill-equipped to handle.   I am glad we have a functioning, capable Biden-Harris administration willing and able to take on this challenge."

In particular I give credit to Biden for getting more spending into the economy than I expected he would (especially given the opposition to doing good that is highly prevalent in the GOP and Manchin - that's probably redundant), and he got us out of Afghanistan. Hooray for something real and not political and that will benefit the people, the real people. 

The deniers of reality have their Trump cult and we know they show up to comment on how bad Biden is, but I will judge him on issues I think are important.

Trump gets an F for failure, and Biden a solid B+, which is better than I would have predicted he would. I hope he continues to prove me wrong."
2021-09-20 10:30:00,"My comments are based on having lived, worked and traveled extensively in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world.

Unfortunately the fact of the matter is that if the developed (rich) nations succumb to Covid-19 and its variants, the developing (poor) nations are lost, medically and economically, because they are so dependent on aid from and commerce with the developed nations.

Therefore it is critically important that the developed nations take all steps possible, and in a timely manner, to fully inoculate their populations, which includes booster shots for vulnerable groups and, as necessary, their entire populations. 

At the same time the US has already given more vaccine doses than any other nation to Africa and other needy areas, and more is in the pipeline.

And then there is the problem of the UN trying to tell developed nations what to do and what their public health priorities should be, interference that no sovereign government can or will tolerate."

These are not friends we've been around recently. However, it seems to be only a matter of time (since so many Americans won't get vaccinated) that covid may reach us. If so, we hope that is after our grandson can get vaccinated."

The schools should mandate vaccination, public and private, just as they do for the standard childhood diseases.  In fact schools should sponsor vaccination clinics.  Bring the shots to the schools.  Pediatricians should launch a nationwide publicity campaign.  They should contact all patients and tell them to come in and get the shot.  The massive healthcare industry should do the same.  They can afford it.  

We must protect our children from the adults who refuse to get the shot.  The disease is going to continue to tear through the low vaccination areas until it uses up all its fuel.  But at least, we can now protect the children."
2021-09-20 13:00:16,"Awesome news. For families with small children like myself getting the kids inoculated and knowing they’re protected from worst case outcomes is the path back to some normalcy.

The US federal government is to be commended for delivering free shots safely and, after some startup glitches, really quite swiftly. 

A pox, literally in this case, on politicians, pundits, and twitterists who used their influence to thwart the saving of thousands of lives during this fraught phase of the pandemic. Their deadly suicide pact with the Delta variant has caused a tributary pandemic all by itself. We don't know yet the full impact of packed football stadiums and maskless schools, but early signs are depressing.

We live in a country where the task keeping our loved ones alive is abetted by the marvelous professionals in the health and pharma sectors while it is being actively undermined by those who profiteer from gullibility and ignorance.

2021-09-20 13:23:44,"Why is Pfizer dictating the safety and reliability of their vaccine?  Shouldn't the process be that they conduct controlled studies, collect data and provide that data to the FDA, who should then critically review the data for completeness and accuracy before deciding to recommend the vaccine?   After all, Pfizer is conflicted with an enormous profit motive.  But hey, it's so rare for corporations to put their interest ahead of the public good.  Right?

Reminds me of Boeing's TCAS system, where the regulator allowed Boeing to test and affirm on the safety of that system, only to find out later, after two tragic crashes, that system was incredibly flawed."
2021-09-20 13:26:29,"We have received three Moderna shots, the two basic shots and a booster. We are happy to have gotten Moderna, which based on current data may be more affected than Pfizer at preventing breakthrough infections. I do not understand why final approval of the Moderna vaccine has been delayed for so long. Millions of Americans have been given Moderna and are fine.

Anecdotally, my family in Texas contracted Moderna. Somehow, despite the family’s best efforts, the 10-year-old was exposed during the week before school opened. That’s what happens when you live in a state that cares nothing about public health. 

Two grandparents, both parents and five children were exposed. The parents and grandparents were all fully vaccinated. Both parents, who had been given Pfizer and J&J, respectively, contracted Covid and needed monoclonal antibodies. 

The grandparents, both of whom had been given Moderna, slept in the same bed as the first infected kid before anyone knew his fever was caused by Covid. Neither of the grandparents tested positive, over a two-week period during which they were repeatedly tested.

Thankfully, everyone has now recovered. Because his mom had been vaccinated while pregnant, the 3-month old was least affected; he had her antibodies. I continue to wonder why, when Moderna appears so successful at preventing breakthroughs, it still has not been given final FDA approval. We head “data” - but really, how much more data do you need? Is there politics involved?"
2021-09-20 13:27:24,The picture has me wanting to remind my fellow parents to pay attention to your child and not your phone.

2021-09-20 13:36:18,"It should be noted that BARDA recently has developed an oral vaccine for two influenza viruses (<a href=""https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/newsroom/2021/usbiologic"" target=""_blank"">https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/newsroom/2021/usbiologic</a>/ ).  Although their approach is to give the immunogen (viral protein) encapsulated in a proprietary carrier, it also should be possible to insert the gene that codes for Covid-19 spike protein into a harmless bacterium found in food (Lactobacilli plantarum). By so doing, abundant amounts of spike protein would be produced by such a bacterial construct in the gut where it then can stimulate a protective antibody response by the host mucosal immune system -- the largest concentration of lymphoid cells in the body. Such an oral vaccine easily can be manufactured and delivered -- throughout the world-- in the form of a temperature stable, probiotic pill, for practically pennies!  This would be a perfect way to address a raging pandemic where the appearance of new variants in one part of the world is a risk to the public health of all. Should variants emerge, as is anticipated to happen with time, it would be a simple matter to add a new bacterial construct to the probiotic pill. Also, since the bacterial construct would remain as part of the intestinal flora indefinitely, the consequent prolonged stimulation of the host immune system would ensure maintenance of a high level of immunity for a long period of time, obviating the needed for a booster.

We surely have the knowledge, talent and resources to make this happen."

In Dec,2020, US Media blandly reported Trump’s Chief of Staff curt ‘We are not going to control Covid-19’ & Trump’s hands-off declaration ‘Giving vaccinations is the job of the States’. In a Democracy, people get only what they ask."
2021-09-20 13:55:24,"Hearing the FDA discussion of this data will be interesting.  I keep hearing the ""kids are not small adults"" justification for why pediatric vaccine development takes longer...but it seems like the strategy has been to give a smaller dose and then compare antibody levels to that of adults?  Kind of like they are 1/3 an adult...which size-wise is probably not that far off.  One of the interesting questions asked by the booster panel advisory committee was at what level (of antibodies) do we see a continued protective effect in adults? So far, apparently no firm level has emerged or been studied, otherwise we would have some useful way of titering people to know who is protected.   I'm hopeful that the level of  antibodies that work for adults will work for kids, too...but I'd love to hear about how many kids tested positive for Covid, etc., after their innoculation."

Vaccinations for children have been around for quite a while now, which puzzles many of us 're' reluctance of so many anti-vaxxers in contributing to control such a voraciously contagious, and potentially lethal, Covid...by getting vaccinated as well. Too bad that, in spite of vaccine's proven safety and efficacy, malevolous liars and conspiracionists continue with their disinformation. This, in a supposedly well educated country, proclaiming their highest standards to the world. This ought to be a reminder that we, human beings, are driven not so much by reason and common sense...but by emotions, as opportunistic demagogue Trump recognized and exploited to his devious benefit.

Getting vaccinated is an act of civil responsibility to protect the whole nation. It isn't just about the individual."
2021-09-20 14:18:40,"If children were not knowingly exposed to someone with active Covid19 infection, how can we conclude they the vaccine is effective for them?  Maybe the kids just didn’t come in close contact with virus during the trial period."

Exactly. Covid is not a disease of childhood. The percentage of kids with Covid who get seriously ill, not just have a positive test, has remained constant since last December through Delta over the summer. The absolute number of kids increases in undervaxxed area but the percentage remains the same. That's how percentages work. The real answer is to vaccinate everyone 12 and up. That's why in heavily vaxxed areas, like where I love, finding a stick kids with Covid is almost impossible. That being said, I'd still give the vaccine to my little kids because it can't hurt and society has decided that you don't get a life unless you are vaccinated. Fine. But Covid is not a disease of childhood. Not even close."

Your pediatrician is familiar with the American Academy of Pediatrics data, studies, and recommendations.  
Although more children are testing positive for COVID-19, actual hospitalization and mortality rates remain extreme low.  
A positive test result does not mean that the child is experiencing symptoms. It means that the child’s body has been exposed to the virus and that the body is reacting to the virus and also shedding the virus. This is what happens with all viruses that our bodies encounter. 
Hospitalization and mortality for COVID-19 in children remain extremely low.

This was always going to be the problem with kids. You might need thirty thousand of them to tell if the vaccine actually reduces infection or hospitalization. 

Antibodies have been a good marker for protection in past so it is likely that this will reduce hospitalization and death, but our emotional response here (""finally we can breathe!"") is based on an amplified sense of the risk to under-12's and an idealized sense of the benefit of the vaccine to them. Especially given that unvaccinated parents are unlikely to vaccinate their kids so that the type of thing that we're seeing in the Southeast will continue in COVID- and vaccine- denying populations..."
2021-09-20 15:44:27,"Myself and all adults in my family are vax'd.  However, we will not be rushing to give this vaccine to our children.   There needs to be long term studies on any unintended or unknown effects, particularly because children's bodies are still developing and the fact that they are not at statistical risk from covid.   

Per the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics, of confirmed cases, there is a 99.99% survival rate and 99.9% chance of no hospitalization for children under 18 years of age - each less risk than the flu.  This is based upon confirmed cases, so the actual risk is likely even lower since many cases are not even reported since children have such mild cases or asymptomatic, on average.

Medical literature is riddled with drugs that were once ""safe"" but turned out not to be the case.  Some famous ones: Thalidomide, Phen/Fen, Zantac, ect..

The long term effects of this vaccine are simply unknown and need to be studied for years before giving to children.  Adults and at-risk children likely has a positive risk-reward to taking the vaccine.  However, I don't know why any parent would consider this for their otherwise healthy children, unless they are uninformed as to covid risk for them."

We've had two shots, plus a full-dose booster (we are seniors; our MDs authorized the boosters).  Looking at the data, we are relieved to have gotten Moderna. 

Pfizer is being pushed; Moderna does not have final approval, even for adults.

""Careful analysis,"" or bureaucratic stenosis? Bureaucratic stenosis, or Pfizer has more money and a better lobbyist?"
2021-09-20 16:12:24,"""But children are as likely as adults to transmit the virus to others, and more likely to do so than adults older than 60, according to a recent review of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""
I went to the reference in the CDC announcement, but did not come away with the impression that the cited article demonstrated this claim.  It is a letter reviewed a wide range of issues.  At best, it mentions that levels of detectable virus in the children comparable to adults have been detected, but the scale of the study was absent.  Keep in mind the PCR test only detects the presence of a piece of DNA, but it does not say whether this belongs to a live virus.  My impression listening to experts is that is remains rare for ""young"" children to pass on the virus to adults, and most children get COVID from adults."
2021-09-20 16:13:02,"The educated, the blue states and the pragmatic will get their kids jabbed and republicans will continue to get sick and live (or die) in denial while we all get stuck with their medical bills.

I really have had quite enough of this and can’t wait to vote in the next election."
2021-09-20 16:15:27,"When you talk with your pediatrician or your physician about COVID-19 vaccination, please leave your Red or Blue assumptions and biases outside the doctors office door. 

You should discuss this vaccine, and all vaccines, with your doctor. Your doctor is familiar with research and recommendations, and is guided by ethical standards.  Your doctor may be a parent who has weighed the benefits and risks of each available vaccine for her own children. 

Vaccination decisions are not easy. Many parental decisions are not easy, especially in this pandemic. Parents are under enormous stress. Take good care of yourselves. 

Talk with your doctor.  Yes, doctors are pro vaccination. Doctors are also trained to analyze data and research, and try to remain impartial and honest about important questions. Talk with your doctor."
2021-09-20 16:15:53,"I remember the Summer of 1955. I hated my parents. Polio was moving through the Chicago area and the horrible parents in the neighborhood were keeping their children away from each other. My brother and I along with all our friends could not play together. The parents were terrified. The Salk vaccine was beginning to get distributed but not quite to our area yet. June, July, August cooped up in our yard and the house. A lifetime sentence for a little kid. Then my dad put us in the car, we went to the school cafeteria. The nurse began explaining about the shot, no sugar cube for us. It was those huge needles. One boy asked "" Does this mean we can go out and play again"" YES was the answer. Every kid got in line pushing forward to get that shot. To this day I cannot recall even one child in that room crying. It was freedom.
To this day I believe in vaccines, simply because they work. Are they perfect, no. Nothing humans invent is perfect. But they are dam good. As they say those that forget the past are doomed to repeat it. 
Those against vaccines really have no idea the meaning of freedom. Every kid in that cafeteria does.
I do not hate the anti-vax crowd. Because they have never tasted freedom from fear, so they have no idea what true freedom tastes like."
2021-09-20 16:16:36,I expect the vaccination rates for kids will roughly mirror the rates for adults. The anti-vaxxers will become even more vocal as they portray themselves as defending children from the evildoers seeking to inject us with microchips/etc. But millions of kids will in fact get vaccinated. We will be better off than before. Then we can resume the long game of convincing the reluctant to get their shots. This is good news.
2021-09-20 16:17:53,"I do hope the CDC, FDA and scientists spend some time crafting a clear response listing the pros and cons of vaccinating very young children. Certainly very young children have not been part of hospitalization statistics that are alarming, and that is a good thing. But on the other hand, some children have developed the deadly Multi system failure due to an exaggerated immune response. What differentiates these children from the rest of the  population is as yet unknown. The other terrifying thought is, with even more novel variants of covid, could it be a matter of time before the children also fall seriously ill? Plus it’s awful to have a segment of the population become reservoirs for viral mutations, endangering the population at large. Honestly, as a parent, I’d take the risk with the vaccine for my child. My faith in the bright front line doctors battling this disease is immense. I’m sure they are working feverishly to figure out a pathway to help children with adverse reactions to the vaccine. To heal our nation and keep our freedom, we need to walk the vaccine walk together as a whole nation."
2021-09-20 16:22:28,"This is very good news to start the week.  Once more, a large segment of the population - children ages 5 thru 11 - will be eligible for the Pfizer vaccine.  Once fully vaccinated they will be protected from serious illness, hospitalization and death, and prevent Covid’s spread to vulnerable individuals.

This should help lessen the stress and anxiety among parents of sending children to school, and also of teachers and staff at schools interacting with those students."
2021-09-20 16:23:52,"I've heard some highly educated adults relate some wildly off-base misinformation about the vaccine for teens and adults, so I wonder what will convince the considerable number of anti-vaccination parents out there to safeguard their children? With millions of adults still refusing to be vaccinated, I admire the faith of those who think this attitude is suddenly going to change."
2021-09-20 16:32:13,"So, will Republican governors like Texas Governor Abbott, Florida Governor DeSantis, South Dakota Governor Noem and Mississippi Governor Reeves be against state Covid vaccine mandates for children 5 thru 11 to attend school, and if so, how would they justify their opposition in view of state-imposed vaccine requirements against measles, rubella, mumps, polio, etc.?"
2021-09-20 16:08:55,This is great news!
2021-09-20 16:47:14,"I've been waiting for this - with the long term effects of COVID, I'm not sending my child to school unvaccinated. 

I feel sorry for the kids whose parents do not wish to vaccinate them, but all I can do is ensure that my kids are vaccinated and take all reasonable precautions."

2021-09-20 16:52:05,"I wish this article can be clearer in stating scientific issue to be determined now- with everyone holding their breath pondering:

1) the issue now is whether the numbers /percentage of children NOT vaccinated ending up with hospitalization/long covid is significantly larger than the significant side effects (the myocarditis) in vaccinated kids at trial. 

If the dangers of serious illness (again what is an acceptable threshold to a parent) or MIS if unvaccinated is significantly more than dangers of significant vaccination side effects (myocarditis), than of course vaccination wins.

Numbers are important. I hope future Vaccination PR  messages will lay this out clearly. Some of us like details and numbers."
2021-09-20 17:01:55,"We still have a long way to go.  Meanwhile, the amount of effort to implement mandatory testing in schools is huge so most districts are not doing it.  This would be the single most effective deterrent to spread by asymptomatic children. Followed closely by adequate ventilation and classes large enough to provide appropriate distance between students.   

Districts have yet to face the onslaught of parents unwilling to vaccinate their children.  FDA approval will sway many but not all.  The US offers free public education and some won't vaccinate their children (free healthcare) to take advantage of it?   So there has to be a line in the sand if we are ever going to make the pandemic fade."
2021-09-20 17:02:57,"The CDC reports 46 hospitalized Covid patients in the country now between 5 and 17 years old.  Seems a bit worse for 0-4 year olds at 34.  While that's not many, if it were me deciding, I would get them vaccinated as the vaccine is far less dangerous and there are the issues of spreading and mutating the virus, a new more deadly variant, potential for long Covid.  The mRNA vaccines are so clean that you need to invoke magical thinking to believe they'll cause any harm that the virus itself would not.  It would be best to avoid both but that is unlikely."
2021-09-20 17:04:57,"Of course the Covid vaccines works for children too. But don’t be surprised if ultra liberals argue that it is immoral to give vaccinations to children in this country, who are much less at risk for serious illness, when there are millions of adults around the world who remain unvaccinated. (I’m not one of them and I don’t subscribe to that kind of reasoning - even with regard to booster shots)."
2021-09-20 17:09:23,Before we make sure that those who are of childhood age get vaccinated we need to make sure that adults who have the maturity and intelligence of children are vaccinated first.
2021-09-20 17:10:00,"I just wanted to thank the scientists, engineers and business professionals who developed and made this vaccine possible. Even though Republicans don’t like you and are trying to undermine your hard work, we thank you and support you."
2021-09-20 17:12:05,"This is absurd and selfish. Kids under age 12 get bad or fatal cases of Covid-19 at a trivial rate compared to those over age 65. We should be sending every single vaccine we manufacture to Malawi, Tajikistan, Laos, Honduras, and any other nation that needs it, to inoculate adults. Once adults around the world are vaxxed, we can talk about the young children. This is also how we prevent worse variants from emerging."
2021-09-20 17:16:28,"I got Pfizer, but won’t vaccinate my kids atleast for now. I know many “educated” folks who also won’t vaccinate their little ones for covid - as the risk benefit ratio is low. You will see this data reflected in kids vaccination rates in coming months. 

Question: If you are okay with this (no mandate for kids), why are you not okay with a 22 year healthy federal employee not taking vaccine? Don’t paint all vaccine decliners as some jerks. Now those who are about to reply that covid is contagious, it is contiguous even if you took vaccine and will be even more as the vaccine induced immunity wanes."
2021-09-20 17:27:30,"""The children who got the vaccine produced a strong immune response, comparable to the levels of antibodies seen in the earlier trials of participants aged 16 to 25 years. But children in the 5- to 11-year-old group achieved this response with 10 micrograms of the vaccine, a third of the dose given to older children and adults.""

Why it was important to wait and let the scientists figure this out. Correct dosage for smaller bodies important!"
2021-09-20 17:36:06,"I don't let the noise of controversy affect me one bit. Three kids, 10, 7 and 5. Would have them vaccinated today, if I could.

2021-09-20 17:41:07,"I want to get my two year old a shot as soon as it’s available. The school closures, quarantines, cancelled play dates, and constant negotiations about covid risk with friends and family is just exhausting. I’m burnt out.  It might not be medically necessary to get her a shot but it is socially necessary to protect her from the harms that covid safety measures cause. 

I hope we get rid of the mask mandates, travel restrictions, testing requirements, etc., and just go back to the old normal sometime in 2022."
2021-09-20 17:44:11,"I remember how indescribably happy my parents were when I got my polio vaccine. They were from the generation where one case of polio could close schools and all other public facilities for children, and confine every child to home for miles for months. Better that than a withered limb, iron lung, leg braces or death for perpetuity. 

I also have a very old smallpox vaccination scar. My Chicken Pox scars disappeared decades ago. I was one of the first kids to get The Mumps vaccine, but I remember being deathly ill with Red Measles and later, Scarlet Fever. I’m not a parent, but I know if I was, barring some special sensitivity, my kid would be vaccinated the very first minute I was able to get them jabbed. 

While I can understand suspicions when it comes to Big Pharma as well as Government, Vaccine Technology is over two centuries old. The Covid vaccines have helped millions of us cheat death. Getting everyone vaccinated bring us ever closer to banishing this virus and its variants from the human race. Do it!"

Many of the middle class work two jobs. We have witnessed long delays in approval to review data. That might be acceptable in ordinary times but not in this pandemic. It should be done thoroughly and quickly. Also it should be noted that these agencies should have monitored and expedited clinical trials like other nations, notably Israel."
2021-09-20 17:54:12,"A key issue that this article fails to address is how none of this actually solves the long-term global pandemic which could become much worse with emergent strains. 
 
The Covid-19 vaccines are necessary and useful, yes, but they function as a recurring stop-gap. Even if every American is re-vaccinated every year, the ever-mutating coronavirus extant across the globe will still be far deadlier every year than the seasonal flu. What does that mean for the future of our society? Remember, this was the very concern raised by the Israeli Ministry of Health in their latest reports.
   
The current generation of Covid-19 vaccines temporarily protects us from succumbing to Covid by priming our immune systems to fight the virus, but they neither stop us from spreading the virus to others nor do they eradicate the omni-prevalence of the ever-mutating virus. 
 
According to both the W.H.O. and The New York Times' previous reporting, asymptomatic vaccinated people are carrying the same viral load as unvaccinated people. Worse, the virus is slowly mutating inside both vaccinated and unvaccinated host organisms across the globe. 
 
Every month, new Covid-19 strains slowly become more resistant to the current generation of vaccines. Think about the implications of these premises. At what point do we stop pretending that the current generation of vaccines will solve this pandemic? As Pfizer admitted a month ago: We must develop better vaccines to end this pandemic.
 
It ain't going away."
2021-09-20 17:55:52,"Frustrating that there's no conclusion regarding the vaccines' ability to lower the risk of getting sick.  I'd like to know that I'm actually helping my kids by vaccinating them, not just that it's safe to do so, although that is important too.

I'll wait to see what the fda says.  At the moment, I'm kind of frustrated to have waited for these results, only to find they don't answer my biggest question."
2021-09-20 17:59:00,"""Given how rarely children become severely ill, the trial was not big enough to draw meaningful conclusions about the vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid or hospitalization.

Pfizer: children do not get sick enough for us to test the efficacy of our Covid vaccine.

NY Times: all children, quite simply, face an existential threat from Covid, thank god they can be vaccinated."
2021-09-20 13:24:37,"The recent studies simply didn’t include enough boys.  

The incidence of myocarditis is between 1 in 3000 and 1 in 6000 teen boys (the Israeli study). These were not the  quantities looked at in these latest studies that showed “no risk of myocarditis”. 

Further, myocarditis continues to be brushed off as a small risk, but untreated can lead to permanent damage to the heart. 

If we proceed with mass vaccination of children, parents need to understand the risks and the presentation of myocarditis so that they can get the children immediate treatment if symptoms present.

We know that Covid itself is a very low risk for children. Let's focus on where the real risk is - the adults."
2021-09-20 18:00:41,"What kinds of incentives could be put in place to help convince parents who would otherwise sit on the fence to get their kids vaccinated?

For example, how about a $500 tax credit for each child vaccinated? 

What other approaches might work?

Otherwise we could find ourselves in March 2022 with only 50% of eligible kids vaccinated. Dreadfully unfair to kids blocked from getting their vaccine, and terrible for society."
2021-09-20 12:53:59,"It’s perplexing how other countries (UK) can conduct similar trials on children and come to the conclusion that vaccines are only useful for children who are high risk, not children generally. Why is the US different here?"

""Their analysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with Covid over a four-month period""
This study is not peer-reviewed. And we have other countries that have said no to vaccinating teenagers let alone 5 to 12.
We are personally vaccinated but how can anyone state with any certainty at this point that this is a good idea for a 5-year-old?"

2021-09-20 18:26:00,"As a mother of seven, my children have been vaccinated since birth.  The first two years of their life is well visit after well visit for shots.  I had flu shots and whopping cough vaccines while pregnant.  Why this vaccine is suddenly scaring everyone is beyond logic. 

I trust vaccine technology. Only 4 out of seven are vaccinated.  With this news I will rush to get the rest vaxxed.  People, look at pictures of small pox.  That was eradicated.  You don’t want this. What happened to common sense.

This underscores how absurd it is to worry about the health of virtually all children from COVID. The risk of serious illness to kids is so low that they can't even do a typical study.  Low base rate! So why the media hysteria to make parents worry about the health of their kids?! Granted, if your child is immunocompromised, a vaccine is important to protect their health.  And granted, it's nice that lower infections in kids will protect vulnerable adults.  But as to the need to worry about the health of most kids - I just don't get it."

We have been watching horror unfold in children's hospitals in the Southern states, and worrying about when the same scenes may play out here: our regional schools seem like a daily game of Russian roulette as children and teachers are quarantined with COVID.

When the polio vaccine was developed, parents vaccinated their kids against a dreadful disease. They didn't argue that ""99.5% of children are just fine, only 1 in 200 is irreversibly paralyzed!"" I hope that each parent is able to understand that they owe child every possible chance to not become one of the rare and tragic cases of a child being hospitalized or even killed by a pandemic, whose continuation in this country is due solely to the selfishness and ignorance of adults."

2021-09-20 18:57:22,"I am a happily vaccinated healthcare worker. It's clear that benefits of vaccination outweigh any miniscule risks of the vaccine for an adult my age. 

However, when it comes to my 7 year old son, I need research that very clearly outlines and compares the risk vs. benefit of vaccination for him. I want this to be based on deaths and serious COVID related disease outcomes. It should not be based on the generic children's COVID hospitalizations number as research done by Stanford Medicine indicates that as many as 45 percent of children's COVID hospitalizations are incidental (admitted for a different reason and happen to test positive). Lay this information out for me, show me the risk vs. benefit analysis, and I will vaccinate my son as long as it shows risk of COVID still exceeds risk of vaccination specific to his age."
2021-09-20 18:57:50,"I confess that I am a bit uncomfortable each time the press splashes a headline about what one of the vaccine companies releases. Then in the actual story you read that the studies are not peer-reviewed, are not yet published in any scientific journal, and that the releases included no detailed data. So what are getting here? A press release by a company with a self-interest in promoting the effectiveness of its vaccine.  I'm all for the latter, but is this really responsible journalism? Since when do pharmaceutical company press releases about their products deserve front page headlines? Can't we ever wait for solid corroboration of some sort, or must we always skip the wait and go for the scoop?"

2021-09-20 20:00:59,"I have felt for a couple of months now that they should have planned this better, so that kids were vaccinated before the school year started. Thankfully I live in an area where the politics aligns strongly with science (imagine that!) but I cannot imagine my frustration if I lived in some mask-fearing vaccine-hesitant medieval gerrymandria.

The kids vaccine authorization has been dragging on for some time now.

I am convinced somewhere along the way the FDA, CDC etc decided to prioritize adult booster shots over kids, even though it is clear to me instinctively that unvaccinated kids going to school in vaccine-hesitant areas is higher risk than un-boostered but fully vaccinated vulnerable adults staying home in the same areas.

I don't know why though."
2021-09-20 17:56:11,"This is an important development as Antelope and Syracuse Elementaries go on “test to stay” and a big reason for vaccinating the kiddies—if the FDA decides it’s safe to do so—goes unmentioned. They may become less likely to serve as unwitting vectors ferrying the virus to Uncle John, who can’t get a booster right now because he’s only 64 and doesn’t live in Jerusalem. Almost half of Utah cases in the school-age (5 to 17) population are being linked to schools, with over 3000 students and 140 teachers infected in the last two weeks. Roughly one pediatric hospitalization occurs each day on average. We can’t have masks, either, thanks to the 2021 Legislature’s “pandemic endgame bill.”

But even if the game is still in the first quarter, the dreaded MIS-C remains uncommon, 89 children under 15 among the 78,000 total cases reported in that age group since the pandemic began. The total is probably an undercount of actual infections, and this along with our tiny handful of school-aged mortalities should help keep our parents from unneeded fear. I’m anxious the authorization review not get sucked into the fights and pressure groups which have dogged every step in our battle with Covid when Paul Alexander, Mike Caputo and Scott Atlas have all been off the scene a year. Fear has had a way of spilling over to the vaccines, you know; and we want our kids out playing, not in bed with an isolation order and risk of complications."
2021-09-20 20:23:00,"This would be wonderful news, except that it isn't actually news. The mRNA vaccines induce strong neutralizing antibody responses in 18+ year olds, in 12-18 year olds, and (now) in 5-11 year olds, and the sun did in fact rise this morning. All Pfizer has done (at the FDA's insistence) is confirm the obvious. Yes, kid's immune systems are different and the dose was 10 micrograms instead of 30, but kid's immune systems aren't that different, and they are better, so this was completely, utterly, head-bangingly predictable. Shall we now run a study in left-handed people born on Tuesdays? The safety data and absence of myocarditis is what matters, but the kicker is this was also NOT news to the FDA: safety events are reported to the agency within days of their occurrence, all through the conduct of the trial, so the FDA already knew what Pfizer would report! 

To those of us who want to protect our kids, and who anticipated the consequences of putting the 100% un-vaccinated under-12 population in close proximity in schools and doing a vast masks-vs-delta epidemiology experiment on humans, this is all fiddling while Rome burns. We are wasting time confirming what we already know. FDA, please approve the vaccine already."

I’m fine with vaccine approval for kids and kids getting the vaccine. But this one sentence buried in this article shows just how ridiculous our response to covid has been for children. Out of over 2,000 children the chance of severe illness is so remote that statistically they can’t even really evaluate the vaccine. Yet we’re shutting down schools, quarantining children, isolating children, telling them they can’t hug their friends…. Shame.

2021-09-20 20:30:27,"To me, performing a medical procedure on someone else's body requires you to first conclude the potential benefits FOR THEM outweigh the risks. Otherwise, all kinds of unethical research could be justified by the potential for collective benefit at the individuals' expense.

That's why Pfizer needs to show that vaccinating children has a clinically meaningful effect for the individual that outweighs its risks. 

This is not just an academic issue.  It could be that vaccination is only meaningfully beneficial for children with preexisting health conditions."
2021-09-20 20:30:45,"I don't understand.  These Covid vaccines were created to reduce the risk of serious illness resulting in hospitalization or death.  As Children very rarely have to go t the hospital from Covid, what is the purpose of introducing an unheeded drug into children's bodies?

Some of you will retort that the vaccine is ""safe"" and so doesn't matter.  But safe is relative.  Does the fact that you don't fall over and die from a shot mean the drug is safe?

There have been untold number of dugs that appeared to be ""safe"" but years later it was discovered that they caused heart problems, cancer, birth deformities or other maladies.  

Just the other day, Pfizer's heavily advertised Chantix drug, used to help stop smoking, was pulled from the market after discovering that it contained a substance that was a known carcinogen.

NO drug is ever 100% safe, which is why each drug is accompanied by a long list of potential side-effects.  Drugs should not be taken unless they are absolutely necessary."
2021-09-20 20:38:33,This is positive development and hope FDA moves quickly with approval. That said I have great concern about the current vaccine given the loss of efficacy over 6 months and failure to achieve herd immunity through vaccination. Vaccine efficacy is the big elephant in the room that no one is talking about!

2021-09-20 20:57:34,"(CNN)Despite all the scientific and medical advances of the past 103 years, the Covid-19 pandemic has now killed more Americans than the 1918 flu pandemic did.

More than 675,000 people in the United States have died from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. That surpasses the estimated US death toll from the deadliest pandemic of the 20th century.

Further proof that a large segment of our population still lives in the Dark Ages where voodoo queens are the source of medial information."
2021-09-20 13:03:32,"The FDA has a history of exercising extreme caution in cerifying drugs for children. Let's hope they continue that prudent path.

Several months ago there were calls from the pharmaceutical companies to vaccinate pregnant women and children. Many in the media echoed this call.

At that time there were no double blind, placebo controlled  clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine on children or the developing fetus.

So far we only have a company press release, which has not been peer reviewed by an independent panel, which is the normal process for FDA approval.

We know that children have a more robust immune system than adults and the data from the alpha variant showed children to be at very low risk.

While the delta variant is more contagious, so far it seems to be less pathogenic.

Finally the data coming in from Israel 84% vaccinated, Iceland 95%, Gibraltar 99%–strongly indicates that the  vaccine does not protect against the delta Covid infection.

This was recently confirmed by the CDC.

In July Israel had 3,038 case of covid among the unvaccinated but 15,634 new case from the fully vaccinated.

So why are we seeking to vaccinate our children when the data indicates it won't protect them from the delta variant and quite possibly other new variants?

 If the risks are similar to the adult vaccine there are real and possible as high as 2.62% for injury, while the benefits appear negligible.

This is a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist."
2021-09-20 17:38:54,"Unbelievable. Children are at statistically ZERO risk from this virus. They are at risk from the vaccine though, and for what? What kind of coward wants to use children as human shields?

Not only that, it won't even work, since the vaccines do not prevent transmission. 

It would be nice if there were one ethical journalist left in the world who would report the truth, that since these vaccines DON'T prevent infection in the upper respiratory tract - only the lower lungs - that vaccinated people are the ones who are more likely to spread it. Because their symptoms are suppressed, they don't even know they're sick and contagious and they don't stay home."

2021-09-21 00:26:11,"This trial is to small.  To many possible cohorts and rate of severe disease for this population from the virus is low as well.  I don't see how you can objectively approve a vaccine on this trial size no matter the results.  Some of the better known severe vaccine side effects are at very low rates.  I don't have a solution but the numbers are going to be murky regardless.  Maybe emergency approve it let those who want it, go ahead.  Others can wait and see. I'm not an anti-vaxxer by any means.

2021-09-21 05:45:59,"Pfizer has not released subject data as to their research which asserts the possible presence of antibodies, but without a control group.  There are no hypothesis test standards.  Therefore the statistical inference is the null hypothesis."
2021-09-21 08:18:19,"The ideal vaccine against covid is a dead-virus vaccine that you sniff in your nose. Dead virus vaccines offer the widest range of protection and are as a consequence the best approach for rapidly modifying viruses. And as the virus enters the body via the throat blocking this port of entrance gives the best result at the lowest cost.

Pfizer is far from this ideal. As a consequence it has a lot of side effects and its protection lasts only for a rather short time."

Today, it is obvious that I live in a bubble.  The disinformation is mind boggling.   Where or where is all of this coming from?   I shudder to think. 

We KNOW the vaccines work-we KNOW we have lost so many to this virus-mostly those NOT VACCINATED.  Those floating numbers around make no sense.  Just look at those who are still alive who are VACCINATED and those who are dead that were not.   Dead bodies speak volumes to me.

Come on people, get a grip and get vaccinated for heaven's sake!!!!"
2021-09-21 11:25:16,"Natural immunity remains the elephant in the room.  How many children have already been exposed to the virus?  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA head, believes the estimates are too low.

2021-09-21 11:49:27,"This fits the profile of SARSCoV2 coronavirus thus far, the younger the person, the stronger the immune response. From a risk perspective, MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) is far more dangerous than myocarditis"
2021-09-21 11:55:08,"There are two issues being conflated in these comments.  Contagion vs. illness.  First, the vaccine no longer prevents your becoming infected with Delta. Second, a vaccine does prevent your getting very sick if you become infected, and it reduces the length of time the Delta heavy viral load exists in your system.

The upshot:  Delta has changed contagion significantly.  The vaccine still prevents the worst of what happens after becoming infected. 

As for variants if billions of people around the world are unvaccinated, variants are going to exist.  Delta came from India."
2021-09-30 10:36:02,"Sitting in Singapore and reading about the controversy surrounding vaccine mandates in the US is very alien to me. I just can't relate to many of the cultural wars in the US - be it the controversies over masks, vaccines, gun control or even universal healthcare. There shouldn't be any ""controversy"" on these issues."
2021-09-30 10:43:47,"It's good to hear this positive news from Asia which is based on people's observations of facts and reality. In the US, the fact that the vast politicization of this issue is traced to one irresponsible (and vaccinated) person is even more frightening than the pandemic, itself. We hope that reality wins, but any success comes with a loss of life and gain of chronic illness."

2021-09-30 10:55:40,"It is indeed a good news that many Asian countries including China did good in vaccination of their population.  People can go back to normal and enjoy life.

Unfortunately, Vietnam is not one of them, where our Christmas supply of apparel and footwear depends on it. According to NY Times, our government even asked the Vietnamese government to prioritize shots among factory workers but still failed due to Delta variant exploded there.

Asia in general is fragmented with many nations with different characteristics. It is very difficult to deal with each individually.  And it is very hard to move our supply chains from there to here."
2021-09-30 11:14:20,"Living in Hong Kong and reading / watching the US’s haphazard response to covid, and its cultural wars on vaccines, masks et al, I just wonder to myself - do people in the US really care that almost 700,000 people have died in that country? Has the culture really morphed so much such that ‘selfishness’ rules the day? 

Case in point - Hong Kong has a similar population to the US state of Arizona, although of course HK is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, while AZ is the exact opposite (desert, rural, suburban, etc).  

HK’s Govt and citizens joined forces to combat the virus, and as of today there have been about 12,000 positive cases and 200 deaths in the City, and as of now no significant outbreak of Delta (fingers crossed).  AZ in contrast has seen 1 million cases and 20,000 fatalities.

And Hong Kong’s restaurants and shops have remained open for the past 18 months. 

It is possible to combat the virus and minimise fatalities. But many in the US seem not to care."
2021-09-30 11:18:39,"“pre-Covid, the discussion around immunization had always been mixed in Asia because of some skepticism about the safety”

The anti-vax movement was alive and well before Covid-19 here in the U.S. that has now taken on a life of its own. Even the former guy who initially down played every aspect of the pandemic is powerless to get the hesitant off the sidelines and get the jab was summarily booed by his own followers for suggesting it. 

I’ve spoken with a few anti-vaxers who have recovered from the virus said safety is not the only aspect. Distrust in government, conspiracy theories, along with personal autonomy are also key drivers. 

I’m betting it will take mandates as a basis for continued employment in all fields and all social activities for us to achieve the successes touted in Asia."
2021-09-30 11:21:42,"In countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, there was some initial hesitancy in Muslim communities - was it halal?  But the imams stepped up to the plate.  While much variation in Asia, a continent w/ more than half the world's people, in general, people are pragmatic, younger people are more considerate of older ones, trust in science - at least on this issue - is relatively high, there is less disinformation floating around the social media, and except India, less federalism, although in the city of Tokyo, each ward had its own separate rules and procedures causing initial chaos.  The delta variant played in big role in jolting governments into action."
2021-09-30 11:24:46,"According to the vaccine map on this page 75% of >12 Americans have had at least one dose. It is a reasonable assumption that they will get the second on schedule at the same time more Americans will get vaccinated. That will put the US at close 80% by November as well. Where is the dramatic difference you cite?
Also you should probably start thinking about referring to three doses as ""fully vaccinated"" if that is even still a legitimate term."
2021-09-30 11:27:32,"Just to be clear, in the U.S., vaccine hesitancy and opposition is almost entirely a Republican phenomenon."
2021-09-30 11:29:10,"No mention of China? Is it that painful to acknowledge that they have managed the pandemic a hundred times better than us?

And no mention of India, either, which is slogging on and  vaccinating about 0.5% of its population a day.

Odd, how leaving out the two most populous countries in the continent still makes this an article about Asia."
2021-09-30 11:34:24,"I live in South Korea and had my second Moderna shot today. And having personally taken that last step I can envisage this country and hopefully soon Japan, Taiwan, etc incrementally gravitating back to near normalcy. 

I'll follow with interest the numbers elsewhere including in the United States (on this website). The thing is, at some point new daily infection numbers are going to be right down in some places (in the 10s to low 100s), and in other places (countries/states) higher numbers are still going to persist. Some places are going to be seeing a negligible impact from Covid 19 and will be formulating an end game, and in other places Covid is going to be dragging on wearing everyone down.

I hope the United States as a whole figures out a way to just apply common sense to this situation and get completely on top of the pandemic. Better to do it sooner than later. It's kind of surreal observing a country with so much capacity to lead the way, being held back on this front by a pervasive lack of common sense."
2021-09-30 11:40:54,Education and common sense - unavailable to many Americans- as well as an organized vaccination campaign seem to make all the difference.
2021-09-30 11:58:12,"The key here is that the people of Asia are prepared to put their individual feelings aside and act for the good of the community. In many Western states, that feeling of social obligation is much weaker. In the US, of course, it is a mark of political conviction on the part of many people to be as selfish as possible. Putting individual ""rights"" ahead of any sense of obligations or duties to the rest of society is quintessentially American. Unfortunately, that kind of thinking has a contaminating effect. Here in Canada, more than 80% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated. However, there are holdouts and places where covid 19 is truly wreaking havoc. In the Western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the healthcare systems are teetering on the edge of collapse because the covid sick are filling up the hospitals. In those places, overall vaccination rates are just over 70%, but it is not enough. Alberta likes to think of itself as the ""Texas of Canada"" and now it is truly proving the accuracy of that sentiment. Here in New Brunswick, our eligible full vaccination rate is just below 80%, but the province has now declared we need to get to 90% to protect against Delta. The healthcare system here, too, is straining as we experience the worst covid outbreak of the pandemic. About 40-50 people are currently in hospital with the disease. Here, though, if and when a hard lockdown becomes necessary, I think the government will do it. But the anti-vaxxers are a real problem"
2021-09-30 12:05:49,"What is more shocking is the fact that even the poorer nations in Asia have higher vaccination rates than the USA.  For example, my brother lives in a small village in Cambodia, he and all adults in the village were vaccinated months ago and recently he sent me a photo of the children being vaccinated.  The average income in Cambodia is $1,550 (US); 65% of the people are fully vaccinated and 14% partly.  The US is 55%, 9%, respectively for full and partial vaccination rate.  The median income in the US is almost $69,000 (US).  As most of us likely already know, wealth does not  make one more intelligent."

It will go down in the history books that even with his obvious failures, flaws, and malevolence towards the US Constitution, the lasting legacy of Donald Trump will be the mass of Covid deaths in the US, the true American carnage.

Are Indian people still dying at the same rate? Did COVID eventually become endemic and the death rate dropped?

Deficit spending is no problem for them, until a Democratic President is at the helm.   Then they suddenly revert to the deficit hawk stance.  Eg after deregulating us into a housing crash/ near depression.   And again now.   Vaccines are wonderful (""Operation Warp Speed"") until a Democratic President tries to put them to use.   Then they ""turn you into magnets"", ""inject you with micro chips"", ""are not proven"" and all other sorts of nonsense.

We will not recover economically until the virus is conquered.

Instead, many in those positions of leadership, respect and infludence for their own benefit stayed silent or chose to play into their admirers' and followers' fears, grievances, and uninformed/misinformed views on the science related to Covid and Covid vaccines, at the expense of people's health and lives, the economy and more cohesive society.

In India, vaccine hesitancy practically vanished after the outbreak in April and after Whatsapp started to crack down on some of the disinformation floating around. 

Our neighbors to the north have done a stellar job too with Canada having taken the lead and expected to further expand the gap between us.

Even a brief internet search including just a looking at Washington Post will show you that the Chinese vaccination rates are significantly higher than that of the US.   Seems to me in praising the progress made in Asia, the authors unfortunately do not want to give due diligence and due respect to progress made in China.  It is unfortunate that what should be a non-political article becomes tinged with increasingly ubiquitous trend to downplay anything positive about China."

2021-09-30 14:14:49,"Americans have everything material at their disposal.  Compared to many in Asian countries even the poorest home dweller lives in a palace compared to those of poor Asians.  Supposedly we also have as much spiritual guidance at our disposal as our Asian counterparts.  Education is free and its quality can be enhanced and enriched by our many libraries and somewhat through the internet.  Everything necessary to be thoughtful and educated is available in the US, even in southern states, although admittedly harder to acquire there.  

So why are Americans stupid to the point of choosing self destruction not only for themselves but often their children?  How do these vaccine hesitant think they know so much?  Not only do they kill people but they are also wasting incredible amounts of money that must be spent on their care and for expensive treatments.  This money could have gone to cure children with cancer or any number of other much more worthwhile life saving projects.  

Instead of being ashamed for creating a selfish, violent culture, their leaders - Republican politicians - continue to lie, or even worst, won’t say anything.  Weeks before Trump was elected, I ran across an old saying that a lying leader kills his people or country (I should have written it down, can’t remember).  I didn’t know how that would apply to Trump, but I do now."

2021-09-30 14:35:59,Our governor Greg Ghoulanforte has not only made vaccine mandates illegal and is suing the Biden administration over mandates but because of him and the Republican state legislature it is illegal in Montana for an employer to ask an employee if they have been vaccinated.

2021-09-30 14:41:05,"Would be nice if we actually knew all the factors, cultural or otherwise, behind the international differences in Covid-related statistics. From the beginning, our media loved comparing countries head-to-head as if it were baseball, except it was empathy, reverence for science, or putting the common good above oneself that made other nations better than the US, when to me it looks like it’s how quickly they closed their borders and got up their contact-tracing efforts. And this year it’s how quickly they’re getting people to the clinic for their shots.

The existence of Rohingya Muslims, Uighurs and Burakumin argues against East Asians possessing special human qualities Americans don’t have. They’re perfectly capable of excluding disfavored minorities from community participation, offering fewer civil rights guarantees than we do. But they are better at separating the public health from the politics, with compliance expected once a decision is made even if that’s nominally voluntary as for vaccines. The US filters everything through its 50 state-level systems with a fight over the issue every step of the way. We’re simply too slow. Our vaccination rates will catch up to the leaders again, if only months or years and hundreds of thousands of deaths later."

If that were to happen to Canada or America, we all know what we will see on the news. I have to blame the media for their mostly negative coverage too. Bad news sells. 
I’m not an expert on anything, but after what I saw in the aftermath of the tsunami, I told many of my friends that if there were a pandemic that can wipe out the human race, my bet is on countries like Japan, Singapore, S Korea to stand a chance."
2021-09-30 14:50:22,"The reason vaccinations are occurring is that they have come to realize that they are the supply chain and will lose enormous value in money and economy if the populations of Asia can't work due to Covid.

2021-09-30 14:54:06,"We need to move on from Covid.  Conservatives and some minority groups are willing to risk death due to their fears or concerns over the vaccine...or their politics.  I don't live in those areas and I was fortunate to have a choice where to live.  Its exhausting and unhealthy to worry about people that aren't worried for themselves.

Every society has values and beliefs.  Ours is an extreme level of individualism coupled with a belief that every person is only accountable to themselves and their immediate surroundings.  The American people willingly elect enough politicians who hold this view on society.

America will never score well on anything requiring cooperation and delayed gratification.  That why our infrastructure has degraded and we have a weak safety net.

Furthermore, we are one of the most uninformed populations in the world.  Large segments of our society do not value formal education.

We were destined to have more infection and death from this.  Just like we are destined to have poor health outcomes, higher murder rates and more violence.

Its time to realize that this is who we are.

Now we derive some benefits from such a free wheeling and chaotic society.  Innovation is higher here since the victor gets the spoils and doesn't have to share.  There is a lot more risk taking.  There are also a lot more people willing to work very, very hard....even to the detriment of their health and well-being.....because the victor keeps the spoils"

Vaccines do not kill but the virus kill. To understand this truth, you do not have to be a rocket scientist. The vaccines are not unknown to Americans. They were vaccinated in their childhood against measles, polio, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, pneumonia etc.  Why they are misguided against COVID-19 vaccines?

They have been administering Sinovac, Sinopharm, J&J, Aztrazeneca, and private hospitals and clinice aer looking to purchase Pfizer and Moderna. Why is Cambodia never mentioned in any of these articles. It's WAY ahead of all the countries mentioned here.  Cambodia has one of the highest vaccination rates, second only to Singapore and ahead of France, China, U.K., U.S and neighboring Vietnam and Thailand."

My parents have healthcare nurses calling to check on them regularly and just got their Pfizer booster shot yesterday. They also have Universal healthcare, so my mom's recent hospital bill for a major surgery was....zero.   

Being so far away, I'll always worry about them but at least I trust the Singapore govt and know that my family is always be treated safety and with respect.

But the Republican Party is now dragging us down into the category of a third world country. Ever since the election of Donald Trump and the current Republican leadership in both house of Congress we have been spiraling downhill.  American research and pharmaceutical organization developed the mRNA vaccines in record and ""unprecedented"" time. And then Republican politicians and ""conservative"" talking heads actually helped to spread the pandemic in America by challenging the validity of the vaccine effectiveness and safety and other pandemic mitigating recommendations, all for some bizarre political strategy. How could so many Americans have refused to get vaccinated based on the idiotic rants of self-serving talking heads and self-serving politicians???"

Does the author of this article know how to do math? The US has vaccinated the majority of its population, therefore the pace of vaccination has naturally slowed down, if viewed only as the number of people being vaccinated without further context. If you took the number of people being vaccinated as a percentage relative to the number of unvaccinated, I'm pretty confident in guessing that our vaccination rate is still miles ahead of the other countries mentioned in the article.

I know from personal experience that Japan remains a laggard regarding vaccinations. This being the case, I'm not quite sure of the author's intent with this article. The writer seems to be implying that the US is falling behind? That's certainly not right. That Asia is picking up the pace? Sure, good for them.

Of course, now that they are more broadly available in Asian countries, they are pulling and going to pull ahead of us, because these are countries not filled with angry, twisted people susceptible of being roused by cynical political and media opportunists into using a slow-moving death pact as a proxy for white nationalism. There are other resistances and circumstances, to be sure, but, in aggregate, the NYTimes COVID hotspot map since the emergence of the Delta variant tells the story of a virus moving from one state and rural area to another, burning over some to move on to others, in search of Trump voters, with collateral damage along the way. It should be called the MAGA variant."
2021-09-30 15:44:30,These countries have a running start. They don’t have a Republican Party.
2021-09-30 16:14:09,"When addressing vaccine hesitancy why do the readers of the New York Times always￼ assume it is only Republicans and Trump followers who are the main hold outs? There has been plenty of documentation that people of color and others who are concerned about the speed of the development of the vaccine are hesitant as well. I really think for the good of the country these people, who dump on those who are hesitant to take the vaccine, should understand this is a country founded on personal liberty (Which they applaud in abortion￼￼) and people have a right to think for themselves. I would like to see all of my progressive friends in the future when a guy like Trump mandates vaccinations."

I would only add that the distrust of government can be traced to Reagan's mantra that government is not the answer; it is the problem. In the intervening 40 years, this proved to be a self fulfilling prophecy; what trust is there after the lies of the  Vietnam war, Watergate, the blunder of four presidents in Afghanistan, WWMD and then Trump. 

I would like to believe we can rebuild a government we've torn down for the past 40 years. So far, I don't see this happening and I am filled with despair at the massive problems facing our nation and our world."

2021-09-24 10:33:25,"Thank you for including the comment that the current problem is not the lack of booster availability, but the unvaccinated population. Boosters will undoubtedly marginally decrease infection rates and hospitalizations, but it is the ongoing resistance to any vaccination that is killing so many and overwhelming our system. Concentrating so much attention on boosters is a bit like preaching to the converted. It is the non-converted who need the attention, and the raucous debate going on at the FDA and CDC will do nothing to help that cause."
2021-09-24 10:33:48,"I am so relieved for all those workers who work in jobs that create high risk of contact with the virus.

2021-09-24 10:34:39,There are a lot of people who are emotionally invested in getting this booster.  The question whether they actually need it has been overridden.  Not surprised since fear has driven our policymaking as much as studies.
2021-09-24 10:37:30,"I would like to have confidence in these decisions but my faith in Dr. Walensky evaporated in May when I heard her during NPR interview defend her decision to tell vaccinated people they no longer had to wear masks. See where that got us…

Also, I feel for my J&J friends right now—with boosters only being available to people who got Pfizer, how is that fair to others? They should have coordinated this rollout better."
2021-09-24 10:45:37,Can I express how much I appreciate the doctor’s leadership and expertise? She has been a breath of fresh air and is a standout in her ability to communicate information with calm and credibility.
2021-09-24 10:47:23,"Dr. Walensky did the right thing.  This was an advisory committee.  She didn't ""reverse a move"" by agency advisers as the subheadline asserts;   she listened to the advisors but disagreed with one of the recommendations.  What's ""highly unusual"" isn't the fact that she disagreed with one of the recommendations, but the fact that we are in the midst of a historic pandemic that requires bold and decisive leadership.   It's not a time for business as usual by a bureaucracy that's been failing on so many of the key decisions.  Thank goodness the CDC director finally exercised her authority to right the ship."
2021-09-24 10:49:23,"This decision seems political and thus will continue to drive distrust. Our scientists need to be scientists and make science based decisions, not reverse science based decisions to align with policy. And we wonder why there is a “war on science”. As a country we’ve given people a reason to stop believing in fact by turning vehicles of science into vehicles of confusion."
2021-09-24 10:50:46,"The initial advice from everyone in healthcare and government was to get whatever vaccine was available. But the follow on period has shown that those who take Pfizer are getting early booster shots while those who took Moderna and J&J are placed in a limbo. If Moderna was ready in few days or a week, would have been better to coordinate the approvals. Also CDC should have taken a proactive approach in asking for booster efficacy data and not rely on companies to make their own decisions, like half dose strength Moderna is pursuing which further delays the process. Pandemic is not new anymore and there should not be asymmetric surprises anymore on these decisions, which reduces trust in CDC and FDA."
2021-09-24 10:51:56,"Following the science has become a tiresome catchphrase, but I make an effort to do this. We know the effectiveness of the vaccines wane. Why should our country, with the highest number of Covid deaths in the world, not provide boosters to those who need them? This is the rational path. Those living in a highly vaccinated region, good for you. Millions of us who are fully vaccinated are not. When will Moderna and J&J offer boosters? I would like to hear more about this than about how much (more) the U.S. owes the world. Read some of the current books about our stint in Afghanistan if you want to know about the trillion or so we pumped into that  doomed 13th Century country."
2021-09-24 10:54:03,"Senior here.   I'd rather wait several month for my booster and keep our teachers and other essential workers safe.  

Of course EVERYONE should get vaccinated but that's not going to happen.  Yesterday a workman came to our apartment who wasn't vaccinated, I wouldn't let him in our apartment but I was appalled he was even allowed in our doorman building."
2021-09-24 10:59:37,"Advisory committees are, really, only meant to ADVISE. They do not issue fiats or commands. As a physician who has been in the drug development business for 30 years, I have distinct memories of an FDA advisory committee that voted to advise not to approve a new drug for HIV, way back in the 1990s. The FDA approved it anyway, and, in doing so, made life better for millions of patients with HIV. Dr. Walensky, thank you for thinking independently and making eligible all those in high-risk jobs."
2021-09-24 11:00:17,"Yes, Dr. Walensky did the right thing -- I didn't hear one argument by the ""advisers"" that really made any sense. Even if this might be a ""slippery slope,"" as one of them put it, regarding who is an ""emergency"" worker, so what? A few more people who may not necessarily be ""at risk employees"" get vaccinated?  My suspicion is that there are those at the FDA and CDC who agree with WHO that we should not be giving third  doses to Americans until the rest of the world is vaccinated first. But right now, the US is in a state of chaos in many places because of COVID (I realize they almost exclusively are the unvaccinated), and we obviously need to protect our health care and front-line workers lest the whole country devolve into chaos. This is not selfishness. We can't help to lead the world out of this pandemic unless we ourselves are strong, in terms of both our physical and economic health. I think the proper analogy for America is to an oxygen mask in an airplane emergency -- wrap it around yourself before you put it on your kids."
2021-09-24 11:01:42,"My primary care physician has followed vaccine efficacy results closely. His opinion is that the Pfizer vaccine is less effective than both the Moderna and Jensen. He received the Moderna and is not getting a booster if/when offered. 
.
He told me he has seen over 200 patients, 6 of them have had breakthrough infections, and they all were vaccinated with the Pfizer. One woman had even gotten a Pfizer booster already.
.
We mused about why the Moderna and Jensen vaccines are still not formally approved by FDA. Pfizer’s lobbyists appear to be doing their job well, better than the other two. And I’m sure they would rather be getting revenue from boosters here than selling their vaccines to poor countries who cannot pay as much. 
.
The American health care system is nothing but politics tied to money as referenced by this decision by Walensky.  I no longer put much trust in the CDC and have never trusted the FDA. And yes I was vaccinated with the Moderna but won’t be getting a booster."
2021-09-24 11:12:14,"I read this to say it is a tough call on whether one should get a booster (regardless of company).  Tough calls are the easiest.  They are cases where the difference between the cost and the benefit are close.  So, flip a coin."
2021-09-24 11:14:19,"Excellent decision, Dr. Walensky.  I am constantly at risk for infection, interacting with active COVID patients in the ICU.  The panel's decision was an affront to my own occupational safety."
2021-09-24 11:15:43,"Dr. Walensky made the right decision. Essential workers deserve all the protection they can get—including preventing infection if possible. The CDC appears to focus only on hospitalization and death, and minimize the effects of breakthrough infections and transmitting the virus to those under age 12—which working parents are desperately trying to avoid.  Vaccinated people are not causing this surge and they should be allowed to protect themselves from it."
2021-09-24 11:20:01,"I worry Dr. Walensky's overruling the CDC's advisory panel and the handling of the booster shot issue to date in general will only result in sowing more seeds of confusion and distrust regarding the  vaccine among those who continue to refuse to get vaccinated and continue to pose the greatest risk to our society. 
In the meantime, I have come across individuals who have received a Pfizer booster shot already, over a month ago."
2021-09-24 11:20:17,"I received my second dose of Pfizer six months ago yesterday. I am in my 60s and work in a high risk environment as a professor at a university that will not mandate masks, vaccination, or distancing. This had led to a substantial percentage of my students becoming ill or having to quarantine. I just happened to schedule my annual physical for later today and will ask for my booster shot. Timing is everything I suppose."
2021-09-24 11:22:39,"This was a good choice. However, which workers will be included? I hope grocery store workers will be. They are deemed essential and have no option to work from home. There is no way to get away from maskless patrons, and no way to know who is vaccinated. These workers deserve extra protection if they desire it."
2021-09-24 11:23:17,"This is obviously the correct decision. There is ample direct evidence from observation that the initial viral dose is important. Health care workers directly exposed early in the pandemic, before the dire need for PPE was well known, clearly shows that a high initial dose, for example from a sneeze in the face when examining a patient, can kill a healthy young nurse or physician. Health care workers are at elevated risk of getting a  large initial dose when working with an ill patient. By extension health care workers are at elevated risk of a serious breakthrough infection that at the least can remove them from the workforce for a period of time and we need to avoid that given the shortage of trained personnel. She obviously has superior medical judgement compared to some of her advisers."
2021-09-24 11:24:56,"I commented in these pages last night, soon after the article appeared, that the recommendation was sure to cause trouble.  I am not surprised that Dr. Walensky did the obvious to avoid further muddying the waters. The main significance of this, to my mind, is that it highlights the incredible bureaucratic missteps that have plagued the fight against the pandemic from the beginning. Add those who choose ""freedom"" ( to get the virus) over vaccination and you have the perfect storm which is precisely what we have."
2021-09-24 11:27:03,"As a HCW, I applaud this move to overrule the vaccine panel. We are 21 months into this. I wear a mask to work every day, all day. I'm vaccinated, but every day, I see and treat unvaccinated patients. The data from Israel is very clear. Roughly, a third shot of the Pfizer reduces the chances of hospitalization 10x over two shots. The FDA/CDC owes this extra protection to those of us who remain in harm's way. 
The pandemic has changed dramatically. The CDC is right. The hospitals are full of unvaccinated patients. These are people who have been inherently suspicious of science and medicine. That's why they're refused the easiest vaccine to get in US history. So, when they are forced to rely on the same medical establishment they've actively denigrated, they are hostile, suspicious, and argumentative. The patients and families in the pre vaccine pandemic were grateful; post vaccine patients and families (chosen unvaccinated and usually antimaskers) have been the exact opposite.
I'm glad Dr. Wallensky has chosen to do this. It's time to start rewarding those who have done the right things all along: distancing, masking, and getting vaccinated. If you want to raise vaccine rates, the only thing that will work is a ban on domestic air travel for the unvaccinated."
2021-09-24 11:27:28,"I wish the CDC/FDA came together and formed a marketing team that heavily promoted/marketed the use of vaccines.

Bring some of the Hollywood stars and sports stars and let them advocate the use of vaccines on TV/radio. Make a documentary   in Netflix/amazon which focusses on how rigorously vaccines are made, tested and approved by FDA. FD A approval is great, but lay people do not know what it means. Teach people about the scientific process

As someone said, the major issue will be the 10 million unvaccinated and not the people who didn't get boosters."
2021-09-24 11:27:45,"While this is the right decision, the confusion and lack of coordination at the USG health agencies is painful to watch, especially as this only applies to one vaccine.  With a surplus of vaccine now available, the logical choice here is to make a suggestion and allow doctors and patients to make their own decisions.  

At this point, the confusion coming from DC does little to help clarify the situation.  We have enough vaccine -- let adults who want the booster get it (because they will, by hook or by crook), and focus on reaching more of the unvaccinated."
2021-09-24 11:08:10,"Leadership often involves decisions that may be contrary to what advice has been given by others.  Let’s portray this as what it is, a rationale decision by a knowledgeable leader, Dr Walensky."
2021-09-24 10:37:19,"Dr. Walensky’s decision was correct and follows the science and data to best protect the majority of Americans who have done the right thing, gotten vaccinated, and will help to best protect all of us who are vaccinated and work in high risk jobs."
2021-09-24 11:31:02,"What an ineffective display of leadership for all involved. This will just add to the public's confusion, cynicism, and rejection of expertise.  We need our federal agencies to resolve disagreements among themselves first, and then speak to the public with a single voice."
2021-09-24 11:32:57,Good for her! I was disheartened to hear the CDC panel’s recommendation the other day and worried it would lead to yet another wave as immunity began to wane. Grateful she stepped up and did what was right for millions of at-risk workers and took steps to crush this pandemic.
2021-09-24 11:34:21,"Bravo. 
CDC and FDA recommended boosters for the elderly and compromised so clearly the safety of boosters is not in doubt. So, if boosters are safe, what would be the basis to restrict them at all?"
2021-09-24 11:36:09,"Once again, nothing for J&J recipients. Millions of Americans received this vaccine. We were told to take the first one offered to you. The efficacy numbers for J&J have always been significantly lower than Pfizer or Moderna. I feel relieved to have followed the path of some well known physicians and virologists in taking it upon myself to get a Pfizer booster in August. Had I not, I would not have felt comfortable sending my too young to be vaccinated kid to school nor going back to in-person work myself at a university. My husband is immunocompromised and I’ll do whatever I have to in order to protect him."
2021-09-24 11:38:46,"The CDC panel recommendation made no sense. FDA clearance and the clear evidence that a booster offers very robust protection made it clear people in high risk professions should get boosters. 

Now do Moderna. I am more than ready. There is plenty of vaccine available and I want as much protection as possible from those who have singled out this vaccine as one they refuse to get, after already getting vaccinated for a dozen or more diseases as children. As long as that 1/4 of adults continues to act the way they are endangering their health and ours, the 3/4 of us who are doing the right thing need as much protection from them as possible"
2021-09-24 11:40:25,"I think the decision to override the panel was a good one!!! I am very sure the risk is much higher for breakthrough then we aware.  Information of breakthrough cases only includes hospitalization.  I don't have a large circle of friends and family but know 7 people with breakthrough(tested positive for Covid).  
3 have been very ill but not hospitalized. Only one was high risk. The others young and healthy.  The frontline workers should have been the first group vaccinated when this started.  Our economy depends on them."
2021-09-24 11:42:07,"I believe the committee voted 10-5 against the recommendation, which isn’t exactly “close” as one source says in this piece, but the more striking things about this situation seem to be the ACIP’s discussion that this recommendation would have allowed anyone to assess their own risk of exposure and get a third dose of they wanted to, and their decision to not endorse such a recommendation. It makes me wonder whether in practice it matters? 

People can walk into a pharmacy and ask for a dose. They don’t need to prove they have a certain job or condition. They don’t need to prove they received Pfizer before. 

My larger worry is that all of these recommendations - whether from the ACIP or CDC director herself are empty because some number of people will do whatever they want and go get more doses and some other number of people will continue to get no doses, and while another group under 12 can’t get any doses. And so the pandemic goes on."
2021-09-24 11:42:20,"Many posters seem to be cheering this decision on, but there is much confusion here, and above all, the neglect of the actual scientific data.  The advisory board (based on published literature) saw a lack of evidence that boosters are required for most healthy vaccinated or recovered people - that is the state of knoweldge at this point.  There is also conflation here about what we previously considered ""front-line"" (those with a higher likelihood of being exposed to the virus) and people (such as hospital workers) that are likely exposed to higher viral loads - the former are becoming slowly irrelevant if they are vaccinated or recovered - as they are most likely immune, the latter  may be nonetheless at risk because high viral loads matter might overide immunity.  I strongly feel that a blanket push for millions of boosters to people that do not require them is reckless and reaks of politics as well as neglect of developing countries that are in more need of the vaccinations."
2021-09-24 11:43:54,"The last thing we need right now is for our health care workers, already exhausted, to worry about waning resistance to the virus.  As a health care worker who was vaccinated in December, I am quite relieved.  I can only imagine the relief for workers in the ED and the ICU's. 

As far as generating confusion in the general populace, I have only been able to have one rational discussion with a patient who was eager for my opinion and changed his mind about getting vaccinated.  With the staunch anti-vaxxers I receive a cold stare and a curt, ""not interested"".  These people aren't remotely interested in following CDC guidelines whatever they may  be."
2021-09-24 11:44:07,"Everyone might be better off if federal agencies stayed within their lanes.  I have always understood that the role of the FDA is to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective.  If a booster is safe and effective for a 65 year old, then I cannot imagine that it is not safe and effective for a 60 year old, or a 40 year old. I would think that the decision to provide a booster to someone under 65 would be made by medical professionals. Decisions whether or not to administer treatments are made thousands of times daily by doctors and patients based on an assessment of risks and benefits.  We are not in a situation where rationing is required and even if we were, it would not be for the FDA to determine.

The CDC's concern about vaccine brand equity is similar.  The CDC should determine whether public health is served in general by administering a third dose of an FDA approved vaccine. Surely from a public health perspective it is better to administer a third dose to some than to none. 

This is not to say that the issues raised by the FDA and CDC are not important. They are very important, but they are policy decisions that go beyond the scope of those agencies.  Too many people in government are feeling free to express policy related decisions that are outside the scope of their employment, which is one of the reasons so many Americans are confused or even skeptical about vaccination generally. That plus, of course, the nihilism of the Republican Party."
2021-09-24 11:45:13,This is disastrous. There is a reason there is vaccine hesitancy and many people do not need a booster and it is potentially unsafe for them to get one. I watched The whole cdc briefing and they voted against that for very specific and credible reasons.
2021-09-24 11:35:09,Ms Walensky’s decision was purely political snd the American people know it. Remember—Biden had already announced what he was going to do before the scientists determined what was scientifically appropriate. The advisers followed the science and Walensky followed her boss.
2021-09-24 10:55:20,So much for not putting politics ahead of the science
2021-09-24 10:40:53,"I love you so much, Dr. Walensky."
2021-09-24 10:50:07,"See, it’s not a booster. It’s actually a 3 jab primary vax

Yeah; that’s right."
2021-09-24 11:49:17,For those who have never worked in a position to be involved in decision making this article is greatly misleading.  There are advisors who do just that-provide advice.  There are decision makers who do just that--make decisions.  It is not possible for a decision maker to overrule an advisor.
2021-09-24 10:39:10,Healthy frontliner here. Super confusing. Vaccinate the world first.  I don’t need a booster.
2021-09-24 11:51:36,"I am a bit biased, as I am an older frontline physician in the hospital, but not yet 65.

That said, I have already seen the cost to my partners. If a group of nurses or doctors were to develop breakthrough infections, it would put an enormous strain on already burdened staff to close up the 10 day absence of that worker. Given how dutiful staff is, invariably some worker will come to work a “ little sick”, and inadvertently spread Covid to still others

So while  I understand the original CDC decision a little, I also applaud the practicality of Dr. Walensky overruling her committee.

There is a real shortage of staff now, and I think it is underreported. Nurses and frontline physician are burned out and leaving careers. And that has nothing to do with vaccine mandates, which by and large caused a blip"
2021-09-24 11:52:08,"Intuitively, the CDC Director's decision makes sense to me. Without access to all of the research data, it's impossible for me or almost anybody else to know. These are subjective judgements - using the same information, we'll conclude different things. Freedom to express differences of opinion is invaluable - what I'm now wondering is who is going to synthesize all of these views and communicate the actual policy to the public. Some egos may be bruised, however, the richness of reflection and analysis is an asset."
2021-09-24 11:52:09,"“Dr. Walensky’s decision revealed the continuing divisions and confusion among federal regulators and outside advisers” Exactly my reaction to this article! Our leaders have confused us to the point of inaction. Am I in this group or that one, do I qualify or not? Of course the medical science is important but let’s also think about clear and concise communications."
2021-09-24 11:52:24,Having all these agencies coming up with different recommendations is just confusing.  They need to be consistent in their recommendations.
2021-09-24 11:52:36,"Kudos to Dr. Walensky for her decision to protect front-line health care workers, teachers, and all others at risk.

Please remember: the manufacturer of the vaccine - Pfizer - stated a month ago that a third jab is needed.

Thousands of Pfizer vaccines are being thrown out and destroyed every week because they aren't being used.

But, here we are, bickering about whether or not we should give nurses a third jab."
2021-09-24 11:53:50,"Why are these advisers and staff so concerned about opening the door for more people to get boosters?  I haven't seen any data or opinion that the boosters are UNsafe.  If they're safe to give, who cares?  Per the article, there's a surplus of supply this year.  If there's plenty of supply and it won't actually HURT people to get a booster, I don't get all the ruckus.  And to people who comment that we should focus on the rest of the world who need first doses, that analysis is not the FDA or the CDC's job.  Their job is just to determine if a drug or dose is safe and effective.  But we're in a pandemic and have been for 2 years.  At this point, and after knowing how ""effective"" the vaccine is in general, does it really matter if there's ""insufficient"" evidence that the booster is also ""effective"" in otherwise healthy persons if we know it's safe?  Just give it anyway."
2021-09-24 11:55:04,"We've been told to ""trust the science"" but the scientists of the advisory committee said that there was insufficient scientific evidence that young healthy vaccinated teachers need booster shots.

Now it seems we're instead being told we need to trust the democratic party."
2021-09-24 11:32:21,"Isn't this just going to be a replay of last spring? Why fuss over the priority list? After the first round of pushing and shoving for (what we are pretending are) limited resources, after a few weeks it will turn out that many people who were eligible for them didn't want them anyway, and there will be plenty.

Last spring, I was all on my soapbox about playing by the rules, waiting my turn, the importance of protecting the most vulnerable, etc. This time? I will show up and roll up my sleeve as soon as I'm offered one, whether it's ""my turn"" or not.

Sorry but my fellow citizens en masse informed me that they didn't really care whether I lived or died, so I'll look out for myself this time."
2021-09-24 11:13:59,"This level of confusion on boosters is unfortunate.
It also appears that decision making has been tainted by political policy concerns and not science driven as the public is entitled to expect. This is the same type of hogwash that got us where we are today - as in poor results for public health.
Those of us trained in science are finding all of this a bit much.
There are too many chefs in the kitchen!"
2021-09-24 11:48:07,"“Committee members also expressed concern on Thursday that some recommendations — particularly that certain younger Americans be allowed booster shots after an assessment of individual risks — would mean that only the wealthy and educated would gain access to additional shots”
Who is in this “certain younger Americans” category? This is an incredibly confusing paragraph that chums the water for identity-based arguments that cause further division. The primary focus of the article was balancing resources and protecting those whose medical conditions or employment put them at higher risk.  
If there was more information to make this section clear, it should have been inserted."
2021-09-24 11:56:51,"It makes entire sense. If booster are beneficial per se then extending them to front line workers as well as those with health issues or the over 60's is clearly desirable. The only people ""confused"" by any of this are those that want to be confused for whatever reasons."
2021-09-24 11:05:25,"Thank you, Dr. Walensky!  It's becoming clear that the Pfizer jab isn't as long-term effective. Perhaps that's why so many people were touting how the pain at injection site wasn't as bad as Moderna's earlier in the vaccination rotation. It sound like it was just a weaker dose. Let's get all workers get vaccinated, especially those working in close contact with the public in health care and schools."
2021-09-24 11:15:07,"This administration isn’t serious about the viru; they refuse to allow production of generics. So most of humanity has no vaccine. 

What we are witnessing is the global triage of humanity. Some are able to shelter and greatly reduce exposure. Most can not shelter and reduce risk for many reasons: lack of shelter, lack of income and provisions, imprisonment, state pressure to work under threat of eliminating unemployment insurance, lack of access to vaccines…

There are two types of crises: periodic which are resolved within the established framework, and the fundamental crisis which affects the framework itself…

In view of the prolonged structural crisis, unfolding in historical time in an epochal and not episodic sense, it is the  interrelationship of the whole that decides the issue, even under the false appearance of “normality.” because in the structural crisis everything is at stake, the limits of the given order of which there cannot be a “paradigmatic” particular instance.

The civilizational crisis of our age is defined by capitalism’s inability to generate incomes for the majority of humanity, to provide jobs and meaningful social roles, end fossil fuel emissions, and translate revolutionary biological advances into public health. These are convergent crises, inseparable and must be seen in their complex ensemble, not as separate issues. The super-capitalism of today is an absolute fetter on the development of the productive forces necessary for species survival."
2021-09-24 11:48:12,Imagine if the previous administration overruled expert advice like this for solely optical reasons. The world would (and did) rightfully freak out. If it’s wrong to politicize science in one administration it’s wrong to do so in another. An actual return to normalcy involves deferring to experts.
2021-09-24 11:50:52,"It makes perfect sense to me that front-line workers should get the booster shot.  It's not worth taking a chance that these people might be off from work from infection at a time when a  full staff is at its greatest need.  I predict in time whether 1-3 years from now, the vaccine booster will be opened to the general public after the poor countries are well on their way to majority vaccination status."
2021-09-24 10:51:43,"Sure, why listen to your own panel of experts when you have political face to save? 

Could the vast swaths of Americans stand to distrust the CDC even more than they already do? With an act like this, the answer is certainly yes."
2021-09-24 10:36:40,"Get vaccinated.  Period.  Abide by common sense rules to reduce transmission.  We don't know enough about this disease to already be advocating boosters.

I'm levelheaded and support this Administration but the mixed messages are mucking up the works.  The anti-vax wonks will have a field day with this."
2021-09-24 11:38:48,"As always, the devil’s in the details. In this case the CDC director preferred the policy unanimously endorsed by the independent advisory board of FDA scientists and the FDA as a whole over one hotly contested and eventually very narrowly *recommended* by her own *advisory* board. Clearly this is not “overruling” anything, nor is it going “against science”, where manifestly no scientific consensus exists (and quite possibly the majority opinion is with her!). Nor is this “politicization” by any fair assessment. What it is is showing some brave *leadership* in a time of crisis, prioritizing what she believes is the good of the country- and willing to take the responsibility and heat for it-  over simply keeping her head down, rubber stamping the process, and later shifting the blame to others. If some more people- especially in the public health field- acted likewise more often perhaps more lives could have been saved!"
2021-09-24 11:57:57,"The underlying problem the CDC is experiencing is the meme we all carry around in our heads is that all science is true and certain and the reality that all science is a house of hypotheses and experimentation---which always has the possibility to collapse like a house of cards. So, for many, who are calling for the CDC to get their act together, I respond, the act of science is messy."
2021-09-24 11:53:44,"""But the C.D.C.’s advisers disagreed that the doses were needed by so many healthy people"".  Not sure if I have ever heard a more ridiculous statement, pandemics infect previously healthy people too. And then we have more vectors for disease, and exponential opportunities for variants - some of which will prove deadly for ""healthy people"",

Too bad advisors may be upset, Dr. Walensky is concerned about saving lives."
2021-09-24 12:00:27,"Here's some perspective from a healthcare worker: we lost all faith in the CDC when they advised us to go see patients protected by a bandana
The advisory committee decision to exclude healthcare workers from boosters was a slap in the face of everyone who has been giving it 110% for the past 18+ months. Not to mention from a purely practical standpoint, it would make sense to try to keep staff from calling out sick by giving them the best protection possible. 
Dr Walensky made the right call."
2021-09-24 12:00:36,"Thank goodness for this. As a frontline worker with daily close exposure I need to be boosted to I can “be there”. Here our frontline workers have been sickened to the point that we need to close faculties that care for patients as so many staff are on quarantine. An avoided breakthrough infection is another doc that can be at work to provide patient care, and not stuck at home with a preventable infection. Thank you Dr W!"
2021-09-24 11:21:12,"This article fails to address the two most important issues:

1) What exactly is the research regarding the safety and effectiveness of a Pfizer booster shot? As stated here, the research is ""scant"" raising the question of what are these decisions actually based on?

2) Which takes us to the second neglected issue in this article: the overwhelming political pressure to align any decision with the president. No one seems willing to say it but if it quacks, it's a duck. Good luck America."
2021-09-24 11:56:22,"The experts zig and zag, and then presto come out with a ""decision."" It looks like political pressure, and then they wonder ""why"" the average people do not trust them. What a mess of poor messaging from the Biden Administration!"

2021-09-24 11:19:42,"My feelings are mixed here but i celebrate for my sister who has worked at Walmart throughout this disaster. Now let’s get all the boosters approved and get them into waiting arms. 

While the policy waffling is not a good look at a time like this, the value of boosters has been needlessly increased by the dangerous anti-vax cult in America."
2021-09-24 12:03:41,"This was the correct decision. Protect health care workers, teachers and others at risk.  No brainer.  If the Trumpies don't want their dose, we will happily take it."
2021-09-24 12:05:30,"In the end, no ""data"" will be able to capture the social and mental cost of this medical crisis to the nation and the world. In addition to monetary costs, stress related to the risk of contracting the disease, fear of losing a loved one, deaths of millions, trauma of front-line workers who feel helpless and are exhausted, divisions sowed by conspiracy theories and misinformation, AND strife amongst politicians—let alone the experts who we are supposed to trust—have forced transformation of the world as we know it and plunged us into uncertainty about the future. The PTSD resulting from this crisis is beginning to push through the surface as therapists are inundated with people who can no longer cope with the onslaught. What I don’t understand is that everybody—vaxxers and anti-vaxxers—are affected in one way or another. What is really going on here? I feel like the world has shifted into some twilight zone."

2021-09-24 12:07:17,"I applaud Walensky's decision to extend booster eligibility to health care workers. It may be impossible now to efficiently assess the immune status of a population dealing with stress, fatigue, multiple exposures to Covid-19. Better to boost than not, particularly as health-care staffing shortages become acute."
2021-09-24 12:07:48,"I’m conflicted here!

When the FDA flew in the face of a unanimous recommendation by its advisory panel to deny approval of an Alzheimer’s drug costing thousands of dollars per year per patient (and a total absence of evidence that the drug is at all effective in any measurable way), I was outraged.

In THIS case, I cannot fathom the refusal of  the advisory panel to recommend boosters for healthcare workers and I applaud Dr. Walensky’s decision to override. Her decision just makes good sense!

Erring on the side of caution - in the face of Covid 19 and its seemingly endless mutations - particularly considering the relatively moderate costs involved - strikes me as ludicrous.

EVIDENCE from Israel’s experience with booster shots (See recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.) is really undeniable and I have to question the EGOS in this country who find any basis to hesitate. (See the OPINION piece in recent issue of The Lancet.)"
2021-09-24 12:08:23,"Absolutely the right thing to do. If any people are eligible for third shots front line workers should be, any other decision is simply not logical. I couldn't understand how the panel could resist supporting it."

2021-09-24 10:48:27,"I am fully vaccinated and will get a booster shot when it is recommended for my age group, but this was a purely political decision.

Too many bosses.  Too many messages.  Just get the shot.   Next month, I reach six months and will get the booster.  Everyone at risk should be able to get the booster.   Family physicians should have the option of giving the booster to any of their patients that are at risk.  

Stop micromanaging.  Stop overthinking this.  We know that at six months, immunity begins to decline.  Let people protect themselves.  There is no downside to the third shot.  There is no risk.  Let's crush Delta before it turns into something much worse."

We are NINETEEN months into a pandemic with a tricky virus that continues to mutate and kill people. 

Let's not take any risks and ERR on side of caution ! And protect those who are keeping us alive, our students taught and food on our tables !

I understand that we do not want to find ourselves in a situation by overusing the vaccine . We have found out the hard way with antibiotics  and antifungal meds not being as effective due to overuse and misuse. 

But, again NINETEEN months and heading into winter?????

Thank you again Dr. Walensky for doing your job as CDC director !"
2021-09-24 11:18:26,This is the head of the CDC not listening to the scientists. Perfect example of a scientist being bought/politicized.
2021-09-24 12:11:04,"From the person who shocked and dismayed many of us by recommending everyone could stop wearing masks in May, as the delta variant was ramping up!?  This seems like is another political decision appealing to emotion."
2021-09-24 10:44:21,Another federal agency without any credibility.  They just appease the White House; not much different than Trump's White House.   We should be concerned.
2021-09-24 10:45:16,"Rochelle Walensky has done more, and more quickly, to erode confidence in our public health system than any CDC director in history.  Every decision that she makes is so obviously political."
2021-09-24 12:05:28,Yet another example of political considerations trumping the science.  This was probably designed to boost Biden’s sagging approval ratings and/or urged by healthcare unions.
2021-09-24 11:02:31,16-2 decision based on science is over ruled by politics and we wonder why people are skeptical about Covid and information given out by our government.
2021-09-24 11:57:27,"It’s a policy decision, whether to use boosters for HCW or save the doses for other priority.  Don’t have a problem with this decision at all."
2021-09-24 11:21:56,It’s about time. Unvaxxed and Delta equals time for more protection.
2021-09-24 11:04:07,"Have yet to hear a single compelling reason to not authorize boosters.  “Confusing?” “Not everyone can get them?” “They don’t 100% stop all transmission and may need to be given quarterly?”  None of these are reasons from a public health standpoint not to authorize shots, which in themselves do 0 harm and at least a bit of good.  Arguably a good reason would be supply shortage: that the shots are needed for unvaxxed children and/or internationally, but the feds are dragging their feet on approving the former as well, and realistically no nation has shown any interest in zeroing out its own inventory to achieve the latter.  Now just debating why they want me to pretend to be obese or work in a frontline job in order to get what should be simple and free for all."
2021-09-24 11:14:23,"This is disappointing that she overruled her own organization. It’s very political. 
Healthcare workers were exposed to covid from March 2020 till December 2020 without a covid vaccine and spent hours at the bedside unvaccinated, fortunate not to have gotten severely ill. Having been vaccinated and given there’s less severity of illness and less contagion this will have to serve.  Don’t want to get sick again from the vaccine “booster” and will focus on other areas of health."
2021-09-24 11:12:51,"On behalf of teachers: thank you Dr. Walensky.
Many schools and colleges are requiring us to teach in classrooms where covid is rampant and where, by order of murderous governors, masks are optional."
2021-09-24 12:00:38,"Ms Walensky did not just make this decision—Joe Biden made it and had already announced it a week ago. That is politics, not science. If Trump had done this, the reaction in the MSM would be totally different."
2021-09-24 11:15:34,"Well, duh.
The data out of Israel, where Pfizer was administered broadly, clearly show declining efficacy. The data also show that boosters can be effective in bolstering immune response.
That the CDC would ignore this reality and not initially include high risk, frontline workers in its panel recommendations is shameful, nothing short of treating these Americans as cannon fodder for inevitable breakthrough infections. And let's keep in mind that even ""mild"" Covid infections lead to Long Covid for a significant percentage of victims.
The CDC continues to abase itself with tone deaf, muddled public communication throughout this pandemic. It's good that Wollensky intervened, but it should never be this precarious."
2021-09-24 12:12:52,"I'm of the mind that so long as the booster shot does not take away from folks getting their initial shot I'm OK with it.  Why should those at more risk have to wait for those who refuse to get vaccinated.   

The CDC panel seemed more interested and driven by politics rather than hard science.  To the doctor who says wait until all the brands of vaccines can give the booster is like the ER doctor saying ""lets wait until all of a disaster patients come into the ER before we start treating""   Again doctors and maybe the panelists are trying to be fair but there is nothing fair about Covid-19"
2021-09-24 11:03:45,"You never know the politics behind the vote. Director Walensky made the correct decision to protect the American citizen first, as she is supposed to do."
2021-09-24 11:35:49,Ok but what about stronger wording mandating masks in schools? She really dropped the ball on the whole masking thing a few months ago…
2021-09-24 11:41:43,Health care workers and others who face increased COVID-19 exposure risk should have booster shot access. Thank you Dr. Walensky.
2021-09-24 11:49:00,"Is “overrule” the correct word to use in this case? The advisory panel put forth recommendations and the director went forth with 3 of their 4 recommendations. She weighed the 4th recommendation against other  evidence and made the decision she has the authority and ultimate responsibility to make. To say she “overruled” is misleading and designed to sell newspapers. I have been part of advisory committees and when the authority we are advising doesn’t go along with our recommendations, we don’t view it as being overruled."
2021-09-24 11:53:27,"So a political appointee overrides the science experts. 

Remind me again how this administration differs from the last?"
2021-09-24 11:40:26,"Only in America can you make a simple matter complicated and be sure to sow further hesitancy and dissensions.  Good job, CDC, FDA and Biden Admin."
2021-09-24 11:28:31,"The problem is that “follow the science” has become a hollow slogan for much of the country.  Ands no wonder.  Politicians of every ilk have used the virus for their own ends.  Just give us the boosters for heaven’s sake and stop the polemics, stop treating us like malleable children."
2021-09-24 12:14:22,"Experts in other publications indicate that after achieving maximum benefit of regular 2 shot pfizer dose, immunity falls off at a rate of about 6 percent per month, on average. My understanding is that among the experts involved here, this is well known.

Yet this is not mentioned in the article, and there are many comments by readers that claim ""a lack of evidence"" about the (ultimate - eventual) need for ""boosters"", which is not true.

One commenter has it right - the experts are saying that what they are finding now is that the best immunity can be achieved through a 3 dose regular protocol, and that therefore these third doses are not going to be viewed as ""boosters.""  With hepatitis and other vaccines its a 3 dose protocol."
2021-09-24 12:14:55,Thank you Dr. Walensky. The combination of science and common sense gives hope. If only this had been handled differently from the very start but we need to move forward.
2021-09-24 12:16:46,"As someone who’s been on the front line battling this pandemic since the beginning, both experiencing the elation of being able to administer the first round of miraculous vaccine in December 2020 as well as the incredulity when so many did not want it, I have no understanding or patience for the argument against boosters because “not everyone is vaccinated yet”￼. 

The two have nothing to do with one another. In the beginning we were told to vaccinate the willing. Even now that’s all we can do: vaccinate the willing. The unwilling I still try to convince every day, at least 50 times a day, as I’ve been doing since last December. But at this point my conversion rate is very low. Most of the willing in my area have been vaccinated. I won’t quit trying, but I refuse to believe that we shouldn’t offer the willing boosters if they want them￼ ￼and it’s safe for them to receive one —When we have so many doses that will go to waste if we don’t use them.￼

I understand the argument that boosters should wait because so much the world has yet to be vaccinated. It’s a moral truth but a pragmatic non-starter. It doesn’t change the fact that the doses we have in storage now at our local pharmacies and clinics can’t be distributed to the world. It’s just not possible logistically and unused they go to waste, not helping anyone anywhere

Vaccines are safe for adults, this has been proven hundreds of millions of times. Let’s vaccinate the willing and continue to help all we can"
2021-09-24 12:17:28,"Pretend for a moment that a Trump CDC director overrode the recommendations of a panel.  The (rightful) angst and concern that would soon fill these comments would be plentiful and portend the end of the CDC as we know it.

I'm not a doctor, so I'm not smart enough to know what the right answer here is.  But I do know enough to know that one individual overruling a panel whose job it is to make these decisions is poor governance.  I'm just glad Mike Pence didn't make the same choice to ignore the advice he received."
2021-09-24 12:17:42,"Good. Not only are these people at risk of the disease, they can spread it to others, including some who can't receive the vaccine.

In a case when you have a disease that is known to be harmful and a vaccine known to be virtually harmless, caution does *not* lie in waiting for the last word in scientific evidence.

This is doubly true when the FDA has already approved the medication for this use!"
2021-09-24 12:17:55,Pfizer successfully used a media and public pressure campaign to get their boosters through instead of providing actual data. That’s a problem.
2021-09-24 12:18:11,"I will not be affected by this decision since I received the Moderna vaccination and since I am 73 years old.  But this action by the CDC is another decision based upon politics, not science.

A CDC panel finally did something regarding vaccination that was science based and not morally wrong.  But then the political appointee CDC head acts politically, reverses their moral recommendation, and commands an immoral course of action not based upon science.

It is immoral to deny health protection to some people based upon their occupation.  The basis for the CDC panel's authorization or denial of booster shots was whether the persons were at risk of severe symptoms, hospitalization, and death.  They specifically chose not to authorize boosters for protection of persons from mild illness and non-symptomatic infection. (I disagreed with that recommendation as I thought everyone vaccinated with the Pfizer should get a booster at 6 months after their 2nd shot)

Then comes the political boss of the CDC who acts immorally by declaring that the health of younger persons in certain occupations should be protected while the health of younger persons in other occupations is forbidden to be protected.

This is just another action confirming that the CDC and the FDA does not deserve the trust or confidence of the public."
2021-09-24 12:18:36,"Now it is completely politicized with access to the booster shots metered out to selected classes. Couldn't have done a worse job of handling this. The booster is beneficial and ""safe"" or it is not. If boosters should be distributed incrementally by risk level say so now with a schedule. Honestly this just undermines confidence in the agencies and in the vaccine."
2021-09-24 12:19:44,"Give front line health care workers the booster- agree. Health care providers  (particularly those caring for covid patients) who got a vaccine 6-8 months ago now have waning immunity. It's going to be harder and harder to keep people working on the front line if they are not adequately protected. This is a sign of respect and concern for us, rather than feeling like we're being throw to the wolves."
2021-09-24 12:22:26,"With so much talk about booster shots, we forget about the longer term outlook. After everyone who should get such a shot does get it, then what? How often will people need booster shots out into the future? Is this just a one-time thing, or are we in this like we are for annual flu shots? 

Where's the end?"
2021-09-24 12:22:32,"It's nice that CDC Director decided to side with Biden administration and the rest of us, people who didn't spend their science classes in detention or shoveling snow. This move partially makes up for the disastrous and totally anti-scientific social engineering experiment, when CDC advised that vaccinated people didn't have to wear masks. As we know now it didn't really had the intended effect of spurring holdouts to vaccinate, but precipitated the quite expected surge in infections. Now thanks to this welcome moment of lucidity on CDC I was able to schedule my booster shot at work about 7:30 in the a.m. Here is to NYC medical research centers making MyChart preparations in advance. Cheers."
2021-09-24 12:24:03,"As an infectious diseases clinician who sees Covid patients on a regular basis, I completely agree with Dr. Walensky's decision.  We do not know if the booster shot will prevent more infections in these individuals, but there does not seem to be a down side.  We have an ample supply of vaccine, which has been demonstrated to be extremely safe.  Why take chances with our health care providers and educators?  These individuals do not have to get boosters if they don't want to do so.  

We need to send a unified message to the public.  Having the CDC and the FDA on the same page is essential in our internet-driven society."
2021-09-24 12:24:06,"Let’s take a step back and look at the bigger picture here and remove politics and optics. This is about protecting at risk people, which includes the people who put their own health and safety at risk to help others and keep things moving (ie doctors, teachers, etc.). Since a lot of people are not vaccinated they are at risk. There is no down side in providing extended protection which allows them. For drs, The flip side is that hospitals not only be one over run but there no dr’s to attend to patients, etc."
2021-09-24 12:24:45,"If the booster is safe and even possibly increases a person's level of protection, why would an an intelligent and sane person not get a booster? And why would the government prevent one from getting it? Anything that reduces the number of cases helps. Boosters at least reduce the risk of more mutations that might be deadlier or vaccine-resistant. I want all the protection I can reasonably get from people who believe that they have a Constitutional right to threaten my health and life. And there are a lot of them in Florida including the so-called Governor."
2021-09-24 12:18:00,Great job by Dr. Walensky. She did made a powerful reversal.
2021-09-24 12:14:07,"It’s a good thing the administration is just following the science and no politics is coming in to play. It should disturb everyone when one political appointee overrules her own panel of scientific advisors. 
That same panel of experts was also sharply critical of the lack of safety data being presented when making their determination
But I’m sure the administration and phizer would never downplay the risk of side effects of the vaccine.."
2021-09-24 12:14:11,"Finally - common sense.   And clarity.

The panel's decision not to offer boosters to workers at risk was baffling in the extreme.  These very workers are exposed every hour that they work.

Scientists?  Hah.  Those voting against offer the booster sounded far more like opinionated politicians."
2021-09-24 12:23:08,"Of course front line workers should get an extra jab.  The CDC is saving vaccine appointments for the unvaccinated and children.  There is enough to go around.  Get the county sites up and going and vaccinate everyone you can and let’s get through winter safely.

All of this political posturing makes the CDC look incompetent- jab everyone should be the mantra."
2021-09-24 12:22:21,So the politician in charge of the CDC overrode their advisors and set policy based on politics????  I read this as for boosters which are not clearly needed and which are in high demand outside the USA.  Didnt this happen under the last president too?
2021-09-24 12:18:20,"Already, there are negative voices on these comments, and surely in the news media, claiming this to be a face-saving tactic for the administration. To those, I ask, do you have a loved one on the front lines? I do. My daughter, a nurse practitioner, worked in a NYC hospital throughout the pandemic, walking past the tractor trailer “morgue trucks”  every day, on her way into work. We worried non-stop. Among the first to receive the Pfizer vaccine, her immunity is surely waning. 

From a grateful parent, thank you, Dr. Walensky, for making front-liners a priority."
2021-09-24 12:15:23,Competency is not known to be one of this woman's high points. Before we jump on the bandwagon and congratulate her let's see if the CDC was right in wanting a few more tests.
2021-09-24 12:19:31,Oh… so it was a political decision but science based …
2021-09-24 12:17:09,"Whew.  I work at a hospital.  Thanks, Director Walensky."
2021-09-24 12:21:32,"Of course teachers and healthcare workers should be allowed boosters?  

Shame, shame, shame on the CDC panel!  We were relying on them for fairness and getting rid of COVID as much as possible.  

Thank you, Walensky!"
2021-09-24 12:27:17,"Where is the evidence that teachers face higher risk than other workers? I am an educator, and every study I've seen on the topic indicates that we don't face higher risk than other professions."
2021-09-24 12:27:45,"The press tends to focus on contention, drama not the important underlying points.

Booster shots for frontline workers are where preventing the spread of infection (as opposed to just preventing hospitalization and death) to customers, patients, school children makes good policy. Think of teachers, whose protection against Delta has been dropping (as low as 39% according to a study from Israel) infects students who take it home to their parents and grandparents.

CDC’s advisory committee was rightly concerned about the paucity and lack of consistency of research about Delta. But they strayed from medical advice to policy when they based their decision in good part on the belief that opening up boosters to frontline workers would allow too many people to get boosters.

 Dr. Walensky made the appropriate policy decision, as is her role.
Protect front line workers to protect much of the rest of the population from hospitalization and death. If more people get boosters than really need them now, they can anyway at local pharmacies."
2021-09-24 12:31:00,"Thank you to Dr Walensky. As Early Childhood Educators work with children all day who are unvaccinated they face perhaps the biggest risks after immunocompromised, elderly, and health care workers. Why wait another few months so that all teachers can get exposed and drive up the numbers? I had a breakthrough covid infection and am still after over a month experiencing symptoms. I know other vaccinated teachers that had breakthroughs as well. Don’t put teachers at risk."
2021-09-24 12:31:30,"The vaccine appears safe, studies have shown boosters are safe, and going into the fall and winter with more people together in enclosed spaces it seems like a rational thing to do to allow adults to get boosters.  One hopes the agencies will set aside whatever is causing this seeming disarray if it is based in politics or egos or some misread of their role in dealing with the psyche of the U.S. masses.

And, please speed up the vaccine for those under 12 years of age.  Covid cases in this age group as a percentage of the total in our area has doubled since school started, and this is with windows open and a lot of time spent outdoors.  One can imagine what the fall and winter will bring."
2021-09-24 12:34:28,"I am not sure what I would do if the data are not clear, but common sense has no role in decisions based on science. Otherwise, we would all still be convinced that the earth is flat.  Sure looks like it is out my window. If the data are not convincing, then no decision can be made."
2021-09-24 12:35:02,"Not a smart move.  You do not want to leave the impression that recommendations are influenced by politics.  

In reality the data and science made this a close call that legitimately could go either way.  The boosters will not do much harm, and they could do some good.  With insufficient data to make a ""95% sure decision"" some will want to wait for more data, others think we should take the risk and make a ""90% sure decision"".  Scientists tend to be conservative with focus on individuals risk, whereas public health officials may legitimately want to take a little more risk in order to control an epidemic.

The expansion to those ""extra"" groups will have some positive effects on Covid in the US.  The negative is that the world as a whole will be misallocating doses to populations with minimal effects - away from poor countries where they still have a lot of unvaccinated people.  Not a smart move in the fight against a global pandemic."
2021-09-24 12:38:06,"Science is beautiful, but it is also a contentious process full of passionate debate over different views.  So, using the phrase ""Follow the science"" to support one's policy agenda is kind of an empty statement.   Dr. Walensky, a respected ID specialist, made a gutsy decision, good or bad (""good"" in my opinion).  She acted like a leader."
2021-09-24 12:40:26,"At least the inconsistency is consistent. Hardly the way to convince people to take the vaccination when every health authority in the country comes up with a different plan. Once Biden committed they should have stayed on course unless the evidence found the booster was harmful. The reality is is is not harmful and very like will save folks. They are squabbling because there is insufficient proof it is needed. Who cares, stay on message. Give it if it might help and not harm. You don’t not give it because it won’t harm but might not be helpful enough."
2021-09-24 12:41:21,"Dr. Walensky made the right decision.

As we head into Fall and Winter, the better protected those who accept vaccines are, the better off the country will be. The bump from the booster may wear off after another few months, but by then we'll be in the Spring and the situation is likely to have improved.

Bottom Line: Allow anyone who wants a booster to get one and hurry up with the approval of J&J and Moderna full approval and boosters."
2021-09-24 12:47:16,"I'm a healthcare worker immunized early on and actually have zero urgency or desire to get a booster right now. While I'm not shocked Dr. Walensky  overrode the advisory panel, I'm disappointed that she did - the science just doesn't support boosters for us at this time. We should be focusing on the first doses for those that haven't gotten any, and increasing access to vaccine worldwide."
2021-09-24 12:50:50,"I don’t think that people realize the main reason to give boosters to frontline workers in health care is not to prevent trivial infection for its own sake, but to keep people at work who work with patients and those who support them.  Absences from break through infections are forcing closure of hospital beds, shortened clinical hours, difficulty scheduling appointments in a timely manner.  The strain on those at work and the unimaginable 80–100 hours a week for some nurses and techs to keep things going seems to be lost in the conversation."
2021-09-24 12:51:13,"It makes perfect sense to give booster shots to front line workers such as health care workers and teachers and I applaud Dr. Walensky’s overruling of the panel. I am mystified at the initial vote. 

In regards to The NY Times article itself: Perhaps I am misinterpreting, but it seems that the author’s of this article are implying that Dr. Walensky has made this move for  political reasons to protect the administration and stating that “The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.“ They also speak of “confusion” of the decision process which in fact has been healthy discussions based clinical data so that conclusions can be drawn. The alteration in conclusions simply reflects the evolution of the pandemic and current data. 

Dr, Walensky is a highly accomplished infectious disease expert and I am certain her decision is solely based on medical considerations."
2021-09-24 12:54:18,"I'm glad Dr. Walensky made this decision, as I think offering boosters to front line workers is the right thing to do (so did several members of the advisory panel). I'm ignoring all the nay-sayers because there would have been just as much criticism if she had followed the advisory panel's recommendation and denied booster for front line workers, it would just be coming from a different quarter."
2021-09-24 12:55:43,"The majority of breakthrough cases are occurring in people with other risk factors.  Age is the leading factor.  Other Americans are having relatively minor breakthrough cases.  We should be working backwards from there, not starting with the fears of people who are already vaccinated."
2021-09-24 12:57:06,"I think that there's far too much focus on boosters and not enough on measures that let vaccinated people get on with their lives, while feeling secure, and put pressure on stragglers to get vaccinated.

Several major European countries have implemented vaccination passes. Now Canadian provinces covering 95% of the country's population have also done so. The Canadian passes are required for non-essential activities like going to restaurants, gyms, cinemas and sports events. The passes protect vaccinated people and prevent unvaccinated people from infecting one-another.

The European experience, and early Canadian data, says that they will result in a significant increase in the number of 18-39 year olds, who are socially active and lagging on vaccination, who get onboard with vaccination.

So far, only New York City and San Francisco have adopted passes here. In New York State, the Excelsior Pass, which we have had since March, could have been used the same way as the European and Canadian passes. Instead, Bill de Blasio has sidelined the Excelsior Pass, and introduced a watered-down version, requiring proof that can easily be fabricated, called the Key to NY City Pass.

We are so obsessed with boosters that we are ignoring obvious ways to reduce infections and get vaccination up."
2021-09-24 12:59:51,"So we are supposed to follow the science.  But apparently it depends on which science.  We are supposed to follow the CDC.  But apparently it depends on who in the CDC.  We were told by many during the Trump administration that they were politicizing the CDC and that is wrong.  Now the Biden administration is politicizing the CDC and now it is ok.

We have a CDC head and Biden administration that in the past month has ignored the Constitution and the Supreme Court and then the scientists that are asked to make non-partisan decisions but are led by a partisan boss.  And apparently as long as the people in power say it is ok then the laws of the land by darned as well as a structure of decision making at the CDC that has been in place for decades.

And not a single example of this decision reversal has been given for having happened in the past.  Why even have the CDC then if the head is simply going to make her own decisions?

There will be many who support this decision (and for me I was fine either way). but none of them will see what is happening for what it really is - an erosion of the acceptance of checks and balances that is there to ensure that power does not become concentrated in the hands of a few.  As long as you favor the decision you say ""Hooray for us, we agree so it must be right!"" 

Remember your actions when the other side comes to power because inevitably that will happen."
2021-09-24 13:01:00,"Many commenters are comparing ""the science' with political decisions. Medicine is in part an art, two intelligent doctors can make different recommendations, and both can be correct. We use science and statistics to determine what measures would lead to our desired outcomes, we can even model, but there are nuances and outside factors that can't be completely measured, that's where the medicine, art, based on experience comes in."
2021-09-24 13:02:57,"The physicians opposing Dr.Walensky’s decision are being too clinical! They may not have every bit of scientific data they need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that boosters are needed but they cannot ignore the facts on the ground- that schools need to reopen this year and cannot do that if there is a teacher shortage and that hospitals are overwhelmed and cannot function without staff.We expect the CDC to honor science but when science is not definitive,then the well being of the population should take precedence!"
2021-09-24 12:45:06,"So basically, there was a mishmash of data.  And the FDA panel wanted clearer proof versus a bunch of conflicting data. That makes sense. 

We need to think deeper about the real-world trade-offs. Because people who are on the front lines need to be heard too.  Our healthy ER Doc son and dentist daughter got vaccinated in January while their immunity is waning by the month.  Like it or not, they take care of the careless (unvaccinated).  Now think for a moment before some people assume it is all politics... Would YOU want to increase your odds of getting (long haul) COVID which is at least 25 times more likely than dying, risk exposing your family and friends to the disease, or lose out on a massive amount of income?

Was their politics involved?  Yea! But at the end of the day, if you are upset at Dr Walensky, she had to make a tough call.  And if you were all on the frontlines, I suspect you might appreciate her decision."
2021-09-24 13:01:16,"Currently your protection (hospitalization and death) from the original jab(s) is still extremely high.  There are still strong numbers of elderly in Israel who have received the booster, contracting the virus and dying.  Of the vaccinated this number is almost roughly the same as before receiving the third jab. 
There should be more time to study Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE).  With MRNA you are receiving a vaccine that is trying to invoke a resemblance to a virus in your antibodies whereas with a flu vaccine you receive a slightly live or dead virus. 
As expected the antibodies in an elderly person are not as strong as a younger person.  As you age some antibodies are weaker than others.  What is the reaction to the weaker antibodies when the vaccine invades?  Million dollar question.  Does it make you more susceptible to contracting virus or less.  Most vaccines that do fail is because they have the opposite effect.  mRNA has only been tested on animals, we are the Guinea pigs so to speak.  What  I have researched is that the animal groups have not been tested/observed by age for proper term limits because of the rush to get vaccine to market.  I am not against vaccines, I have been faxed, but maybe we are approaching this wrong.  The elderly are for the most part being exposed to non vaccinated health care workers ( there are many).  The workers should be vaccinated. Are we making some elderly more susceptible by giving them a third jab?"
2021-09-24 12:58:12,"In New Jersey, you don't have to show proof of your immunocompromised status. That's means a booster is available to whomever wants one, as supply is not an issue. I would like to think this was behind her decision."
2021-09-24 12:31:02,"Yesterday, my doctor told me he had removed his son from the public school in nyc and put him in a school that requires vaccinations.  It seemed like the chaos sown by politics has not unlike the 1950's targeting the public sector undermining the well being of all Americans."
2021-09-24 12:51:18,"Good.  I am vaccinated, and my private college has excellent policies including a vaccine mandate or weekly testing as well as masking.  But my classroom is small.  There is extremely high Covid in this area with few ICU rooms available and no masks in sight except where I work.

I have medical vulnerabilities and am back in cautious mode.  Kemp and the boards of trustees of state universities would rather have deaths and illnesses rather than mask or vaccine mandates.

I will wait for the Moderna booster but am happy it is on the horizon.

For red states screaming that they are pro life, they sure don’t act like it.  My state isn’t completely insane like Florida and Texas but not very good.  I hope the extremist governors and trustees get sued or charged with reckless endangerment when they are so indifferent to actual lives."
2021-09-24 12:45:35,Of course teachers should get a booster shot!  This was a wise decision.
2021-09-24 13:07:09,"The vast majority of commenters here don't even know what science is.

They also have no idea about committee dysfunction in the biomedical academic community.  Both the FDA and the CDC advisory committees are excellent examples of that.

I was critical of Rochelle Walensky in the past and I continue to be so, but she has earned my respect with this decision.  It took guts and it was the obvious correct one."
2021-09-24 12:37:21,"why in the world would they NOT recommend boosters for health care workers, etc?"
2021-09-24 12:43:40,"In an interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN on Aug. 5, 2021, the director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, MD, said that, while she believed the COVID vaccines “work well” with the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus “with regard to severe illness and death,” they are no longer able to “prevent transmission” of the virus.

Let's emphasize that last phrase, the vaccines no longer prevent the spread or transmission of the virus.

By ""approving"" the booster under conditions of the administration's mandate, Dr. Walensky is in effect mandating the booster for all health care workers.

In an earlier survey by the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons less than half of doctors surveyed had taken the vaccine.

The reason given was simple. The safety data on the clinical studies will not be fully available until 2023.

Normally, there are lab simulations, animal studies, adjustments from those studies, human clinical trials and sometimes adjustments from those trials before a product is certified as safe and effective.

The FDA skipped animal testing and went right to human clinical trials. All this is being done under Emergency Use Authorization rules.

That means that we are all the human clinical trial, it's just that we don't know it. But those doctors in the survey do.

There are no well designed clinical trials on the effects of taking multiple shots. And according to the CDC Director, they still won't stop the spread of the virus.

Does the benefit outweigh the risk?"
2021-09-24 12:29:41,"If the experts give mix signals to one another, how are the American people suppose to react?!"
2021-09-24 13:08:12,"Both me and my wife are in our 60s but below 65. My wife retired early this year. She was not yet eligible for a shot and her work wanted IT workers to come in for solidarity with manufacturing workers. She resigned and decided to retire. I lecture in class of 50+ University students and was appalled that the ACIP would have no qualms in waiting for more vaccinated Americans to die before finding ""evidence"". Thanks Dr. Walensky. I can look forward to many more years of being a productive citizen. I will be eligible for a vaccine like my counter parts in Germany, UK, Israel, UAE, Chile etc. Both the FDA and CDC politically appointed leadership have righted their ships. Thanks President Biden and Dr. Fauci."
2021-09-24 12:59:43,"Please stop calling Dr. Walensky's decision ""overruling"" anything. Using the word ""overrule"" not only misrepresents the facts, but it also stokes the fire of the tiresome anti-vaxxers who imperil our lives and our long-term health, to say nothing of the economy.
Dr. Walensky was given a ""recommendation,"" but the ""decision"" was hers to make. I, for one, think it was the right decision. The country's frontline workers, especially healthcare workers, are already overburdened. They deserve to be as well-protected as possible. To those who object to them getting a booster, I would say you would be up a creek without a paddle if enough healthcare workers fell ill - or quit. Now, let's get a decision on Moderna and J&J boosters ASAP."
2021-09-24 12:58:46,Thank goodness someone with common sense. I already know many who have received illicit boosters thanks to the admin dragging its heels on this decision.
2021-09-24 13:10:37,"Now, this is a mensch.
Retired RN"
2021-09-24 13:10:47,"Lets not forget that on this specific question the FDA experts supported the decision of Dr. Walensky and the CDC advisory panel was divided although a small majority recommended against.  So this is not like banning mask mandates, where a ""decider"" goes against all expert advice, for their own political gain."
2021-09-24 13:11:14,"Pfizer was first to call for boosters but the FDA pushed back. Then the FDA got on board w/ the idea as did the Biden administration. And now, against the advice of its own advisory panel, the CDC director is endorsing the idea, but only for Pfizer.
Under the Trump administration most would see this as dirty dealing but now under the Biden administration it's good policy. Go figure...."
2021-09-24 13:13:09,"I agree with Dr. Walensky. However, I disagree with the CDC  overall incremental approach to boosters and the indiscriminate use/overuse of the the vaccine as boosters. There is data now showing the correlation of low spike protein antibody levels with low neutralizing antibody levels, that was used in the original studies and theincreased risk of break through infections with low antibody levels. Every person over 65 and every at risk healthcare worker does not need a booster now. Spike protein antibodies that have been used to define the immunocompromised patients at risk can also be used for everyone else. 72% of the patients in my primary care practice had maximal detectable antibodies on the initial Spike protein antibody test and do not need boosters now. This is a cohort of over 650+ patients tested so far and confirms the robust response from the mRNA vaccines. But my data also shows waning immunity and confirms the need for boosters. We need an objective way to define those who should be a priority for boosters and I disagree with the CDC for not using this type of data rather than their broad and unquantifiable severity of illness index."
2021-09-24 13:13:43,"The rationale of ""you don't need a booster because the odds are you won't get seriously ill or die"" offers minimal reassurance for those who actually are doing everything they can to avoid contracting COVID. 
Not everyone works for a company with paid medical leave and health insurance. Some people are self-employed in businesses where not working means no income. Not working for more than several weeks due to a sickness that's debilitating but not life-threatening may result in losing customers and needed income. The possibility of long COVID has its own terrifying consequences for the self employed.
When this country starts providing a safety net equivalent to those provided in most other affluent nations, then the advisory panel's rationale would be easier to swallow."
2021-09-24 13:14:07,The brave people in this story are the scientist that followed the science and provided their scientific opinion against the wishes of the politicians.  I have seen this many times. Management announces something before the engineers or scientists reached conclusions as a way to coerce the scientists to reach a particularly desired conclusion.  I see the White House announcement getting ahead of the scientific recommendations as a way to signal the FDA and CDC about the desired outcome of the recommendations.  And we wonder why we have lost trust in government and the scientific community.  Trust is earned and it is like a fine vase: it takes a long time to build but seconds to shatter.
2021-09-24 13:14:16,Good decision! I work with the public and definitely want a booster.
2021-09-24 13:14:53,She is the Boss. She got advice from within her company and advice from scientific recommendations outside her company then announced her decision. Pretty standard practice in most organizations.
2021-09-24 13:15:31,"I worry that before you know it this recommendation will become instead become mandatory. That make sense.  I don’t understand why people are being advised to get a third shot of Phizer, when an article just a couple of days ago said the Moderna vaccine might be longer lasting. Wouldn’t it make more sense that people get the Moderna booster instead or a vaccine that was made to counteract the latest variant, like they do with the flu.  Also public health officials think that the virus will not be brought under control more people in other parts of the world are vaccinated at least once, including people here. Some people might not even need a booster yet at all. Why give them a shot they don’t even need, particularly after just six months. Why isn’t more testing being done to see who might actually need the vaccine. It might not be just based on age.

I know the data isn’t there yet to determine all this, but certainly there should be some data available by now. If people want the Phizer booster, then by all means it should be available to them no matter their age. But please don’t make it mandatory until more data about the need for this booster in particular has been done."
2021-09-24 13:16:19,"Completely agree with the decision and think it should have been broader. I believe the decisions by the committees were political ones not science based. All the data shows immunity is waning for infection for everyone. While that not mean severe disease or hospitalization for most people, it can still mean getting a breakthrough infection which means isolation  (at the minimum) and sick in bed for days or even a week. Everyone I know who had a breakthrough infection it was the latter and residual symptoms for days. At the minimum that means not working, and for many people that means not getting paid or taking care of family. 

The scientists are living in an ideal world, were they think the country should be focused on the unvaccinated.  What do they has been happening everyday for months — at every level. Unfortunately, a wall has been hit. The US has already committed billions of dose to underdeveloped countries — making their decision doesn’t mean more doses are going to sent. I get a flu vaccine every year — I don’t take it because I think I’ll go into the hospital if I don’t. I get it (as most people do) because I don’t want catch a nasty bout of the flu. That’s the same for many many vaccines and medications. The citizens of the US paid for the vaccines and if another shot will prevent us from getting sick, then I say yes. All the studies have shown there is no adverse effects."
2021-09-24 13:23:19,"Advisors advise. Leaders decide. Good decision on her part to look at the bigger picture which brings in a range of factors: public sentiment, what the White House wants, what different groups of stakeholders (teachers and health care workers) want. Those who argue the decision should only take into account ""the science,"" assert the practitioners of ""the science"" have a firm grip on ground truth and don't allow for the level of uncertainty that actually exists.

This entire FDA and CDC process needs to be rethought and reordered once we get past this pandemic. I love them all, but the confused public messaging alone is a major problem."
2021-09-24 13:14:14,"3,000 deaths from COVID yesterday, but still no reporting of how many of those 3,000 were from breakthrough infections.  Instead of continuing to just tell us that the vaccinated are protected, give us the data."
2021-09-24 13:17:38,A bureaucrat overruling a nearly unanimous ruling by the FDA does not inspire confidence
2021-09-24 13:26:02,"And Canada mixes vaccine types with no better reason than they don't have enough supply to give people the same type twice. This isn't science, it's politics. Just like the CDC reversing its guidance on K-12 masks two days after the teacher's unions complained."
2021-09-24 13:13:02,"My husband is an ER physician in an overly
busy metropolitan hospital— one that has been loaded with Covid patients since the start of the pandemic.
Unless you’ve seen what he has seen or been in a critical situation regarding Covid yourself please don’t peddle platitudes.

Unvaccinated patients are pouring in and nurses and aides are walking off the job rather than agreeing to vaccine mandates. All the while, and surprisingly, hospital administrators are high on profitability margins and add all sorts of new marketing tasks to the doctors’ 
responsibilities to the extent where if you close one eye you might confuse the ER waiting room
with a counter at your favorite retail store — and that seems to be what administration wants. 
The cognitive dissonance is outstanding, as is the lack of empathy for what is happening in the
world. 

Come on people everywhere, our healthcare workers are exhausted. Please stop quibbling.  Please, let's all just
get vaccinated. Get booster shots. Let’s get this done!"

2021-09-24 13:16:33,I read who was on the committee. A good number were experts in pediatrics not in immunology or infectious diseases. That explains  the reasoning behind the decision to essentially conduct the largest uncontrolled experiment on American adults ever to see whether there are enough adult breakthrough deaths to warrant a booster. Why are there no gerontologists and infectious disease experts on the panel? Our family lost a vibrant aunt to Covid breakthrough. I see the handwriting on the wall. They are culling the herd.
2021-09-24 13:17:13,This is a war on  CVID-19.  Dr. Walensky is an on-field commander at this war.  One can not win a war without protecting the troops.  Dr. Walensky made the right decision. She deserves all the support is needed to win this war for humanity.
2021-09-24 13:23:17,"One more risible decision-making cycle, where acknowledging science taking a back seat to accommodating politics...

For once, the CDC seemed to be shaping policy based on what'd been demographically obvious within 3 months of onset:

> For whatever reason, under-40 mortality rates drastically lower than those older.  Currently, the number of under-40 US deaths ~5-6% of the overall COVID fatality count

> Of under-40’s who died, more than 90% had one/more significant underlying health conditions

Recall, this is the same CDC that flubbed everything from detection/testing early on, by substituting their (wrong) test for a correct one developed in Germany – after being gifted the full genomic sequence of the virus and early variants…

For a year, the Credulous Deep Clinic appeared at least as focused on bringing Trump down, as COVID…

Recall Warren bashing Slaoui gratuitously at a hearing – while circumspect (6/23/21 letter to Wyden) re a contorted FDA approval of an Alzheimer’s drug from a home-state biotech…

Along the way, we’ve had 0, 1, and 2 masks recommended – indoors, outdoors, vaxxed, unvaxxed, either/both…

More subtly, the epidemiology ecosystem – professing profound ignorance at the onset re susceptibility and spread, excusing all sorts of over-reaching over-politicized actions – recently has all sorts of insights on all sorts of variants…

Which magically seem to justify a path of chronic dysfunction/disruption – and gravy train HC and “stimulus” spending…"
2021-09-24 13:14:37,"I think it is a good decision, but keep in mind that this is the same CDC Director who “emotionally”  announced in March her feeling of “impending doom” for us all."
2021-09-24 13:21:40,Why do you have to get a booster of the same vaccine?  Wouldn't be better to get a booster of a vaccine that you did not get?  I had the J&J vaccine and maybe I should get a Pfizer booster.
2021-09-24 13:25:06,"too much hair splitting on the CDC panel. if boosters are justified, front line workers need to have access. Keep it simple."
2021-09-24 13:24:12,"And so goes the ineptitude of the CDC.  Poor communication in July on the efficacy of the vaccine followed up by this blunder.

""Following the science"" isn't as simple as President Biden made it seem."
2021-09-24 13:26:19,"The recommendation  at this point  should be to offer boosters to all Americans who have been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.

Healthy, vaccinated teachers and grocery store workers should not be given priority  over other Americans.

Parents are  exposed at closer range to  children under twelve, who are being exposed to other children at school. 

The reality is that every American who wants a booster can can walk into CVS, Walgreens or any number of pharmacies and obtain a booster shot, and millions have done so.

Israel has proven that the immunity from the Pfizer vaccine wanes over time ,and has been offering boosters to all Israelis who are old enough to have been vaccinated.  Other countries have been boosting their citizens.

These contradictory conclusions of the C.D.C. and F.D.A. , and 
Dr. Wolensky's  having reversed the move of the  C.D.C.'s  advisors  erodes the credibility of the C.D.C.  & F.D.A. and of American public health officials further.

American public health ""experts""  have given Americans no reason to trust the ""experts.""

I knew that public health experts were lying when they said that masks did not protect the wearer.

Those who lie prove that they can't be trusted.

I've have received a booster sooner if I were not in an unfamiliar area and had a car. I'm not willing to expose myself to an Uber driver IF Uber exists at my location.

I'm trying to figure out how to get a booster before I head back to civilization."
2021-09-24 13:26:38,"This kind of infighting is not a good look for the CDC and is only going to give more ammunition to anti-vaxxers that believe the government is making it up as they go along.

Many comments on this article endorsing the CDC chief's overruling seem hypocritical to me and go against the idea of ""trusting the science"" given the CDC advisers (apparently valid) concerns over conflicting published research regarding boosters."
2021-09-24 13:13:39,"What happened to ""It's all about the Science?""  Looks like that should read ""It's all about the Politics."""
2021-09-24 13:17:12,"Both parties can play the ""let's ignore science"" game."
2021-09-24 13:28:26,"The US has the highest (measured) number of deaths from COVID, and the highest number and rate of COVID vaccinations. We know vaccination efficacy, especially Pfizer's, decreases to below-acceptable threshold levels after six months (and for those over age 50 or 60, nothing magic about the US' attachment to ""over 65"") How many more studies do we need? Boosters ARE safe, why else would they be permitted, even encouraged, for the most frail? President Biden had it right the first time. Until and unless we actually do not have enough doses to serve the trickle of previously unvaccinated Americans (and would-be migrants) we should allow and even encourage all those willing to do so, to get booster shots.  The doses sitting and expiring in pharmacies across the country are not going to be redistributed to the rest of the world."
2021-09-24 13:28:39,"Considering that so many doses are being held in reserve for people who will never accept them before it is necessary to discard the vaccine, I see no problem with throwing open the doors for mix-and-match boosters for everyone.  I have already accepted that the US is incapable of beating this pandemic because of political idiocy.  Our public health goal should shift towards providing the best possible protection for those who believe in modern medicine, so that they are not killed by the willfully reckless.  Natural selection will deal with the latter."
2021-09-24 13:33:22,"It's amazing how many commenters here opine that the decision by Dr. Walensky about booster shots for those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech is blatantly political.

In my opinion it is science based on the constantly changing Covid-19 virus, especially the up to now most infectious Delta variant. 

Do we have to go through the whole Greek alphabet before boosters are available?

I was lucky having been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech early February, but followed the data that it is losing its formerly very high efficacy quite a bit, and will receive my booster next week.

Other advanced nations with much lower per capita hospitalizations and deaths had started booster shots already. It was about time that the supposedly greatest country in the world would do the same.

The problem on our shores is having an extraordinary large percentage of anti-vaxxers, many of them basing their decisions on conspiracy theories on arch-right wing propaganda."
2021-09-24 13:33:28,"I find it interesting that this article is written in a way that emphasizes that this gives a boost to President Biden’s plans to make booster shots available ahead of all the other reasons behind the decision.

It may be natural for reporters to imply politics are the primary driver of this decision (certainly that was always the case in the previous administration), but it reinforces how the pandemic has been politicized beyond all reason.

There’s a couple of points that need to be considered here. One is that it puts the CDC in line with the FDA, providing consistent policy for the public.

Two is that it correctly - in my opinion - prioritizes the risks and benefits of the booster shot. Waiting to see more evidence that this helps people at high risk means waiting to see how many will get sick and die without it. 

Getting a booster shot doesn’t create additional risk to them. If it proves to make no difference, no harm has been done to them. If it does make a difference, that should become clear relatively quickly.

A number of people remain unvaccinated - but that’s not a matter of supply constraints as much as willful refusal. There are shots available - let’s use them where they might make a critical difference.

Framing it as unfair to give some booster shots while others wait for their vaccines to be approved is arguing to leave people at risk simply because the way events have unfolded have given them a temporary advantage.

Just do it."
2021-09-24 13:34:02,"I am mystified by what appears to be preliminary scientific consensus that what salient data we have indicates that people age 60 and over who have received the Pfizer vaccine are more likely to be experiencing a faster ebbing of protection, but that the official advice and it would seem now CDC direction regarding that only targets by age those 65 and over. And there's no direct addressing of this disparity. One is left to surmise a reason, such as this is a gesture towards not hogging doses so that more of the unwilling Americans or people outside the USA will get those ""saved"" doses allocated to them."
2021-09-24 13:33:56,"Thank you, Dr. Walensky. Finally, someone at CDC with common sense. Frontline workers face heavy exposure to Covid daily. Should be first in line. Thanks again."
2021-09-24 13:34:40,Finally there is an adult in the room. The FDA and CDC  advisory committees are just that advisory. During the hearing they sounded like people divorced from reality with their heads in the air. They should be required to go work in covid units before being allowed to be voting members of the CDC and FDA advisory committees. It is just unbelievable that the CDC committee voted down providing boosters to healthcare workers. Dr. Walensky showed the necessary leadership for the chaos caused by the CDC advisory committee. These committees need to be disbanded. A new structure is needed. The committees do not work in pandemic situations.
2021-09-24 13:38:43,"Good.  Data from the UK and Israel seem quite clear proving boosters are needed 5-6 months later.  Why this became a problem makes no sense, except for perhaps an issue with supply/production/WHO wanting doses to instead go to other countries.  Breakthrough cases are rising as people are further from their two doses.  The implications for high health care costs due to allowing people to get Covid vs the cost of the vaccine are obvious and predictable. 

The largest issue that seems to always be glossed over is only focusing on severe disease and death, which thankfully the vaccines offer such protection.  However, the goal should be protection from getting Covid in the first place.  Period.  Between longhaulers and the potential long term damage to organs from even asymptomatic to mild cases, we should follow Israel and boost as many as possible.  Moreover, although there is fatigue out there, the only thing that will allow us all hopefully to move past this one day is vaccines plus masks and social distancing,  All  three are necessary.  However, the politicization of masks and vaccines seems to have doomed us, tragically."
2021-09-24 13:38:59,"Lots of tempests in lots of teapots. The end result is a sensible policy focused on prioritizing the most vulnerable and boosting the morale of health care workers, as well as their resistance to disease. 

We have a crisis among health care workers. They are suffering from burnout due not only to the disease but to living in a society that fails to do what we know works to respond to it. (See Florida, Texas, etc.) Leaving them out of the first round of boosters would have made it even worse."
2021-09-24 13:40:18,An obviously political decision. Science is not so conveniently reversed.
2021-09-24 13:40:42,"The right answer is to vaccinate and revaccinate as many people (and even zoo animals!) as possible, to reduce everyone’s exposure to this virus.  It is an actual emergency and has to be treated as such.  It’s astonishing that advisory panels and experts don’t grasp the risk of doing nothing when inaction can cost lives."
2021-09-24 13:43:10,Whether or not Dr. Walensky made the correct medical decision in rejecting the recommendations of her advisors (I have already received a Moderna booster prescribed by my doctor and I’m not in any of the groups who are booster eligible or who were even being considered for such eligibility) the fact that she departed from the long standing practice of the CDC director adopting the recommendations of his/her advisors will cause many to reasonably conclude that her decision was based more on politics than on medicine.
2021-09-24 13:43:34,"Framing this as overruling a vote fundamentally mischaracterizes the roles of Dr. Walensky (authorized and responsible to make a decision) and the advisory committee. These advisory committees are not democratic, representative bodies, they are panels constituted with diverse expertise intended to get all the issues on the table and to expose the points of uncertainty or debate and, when possible, identify points of scientific consensus. The vote count in a closely divided group is literally meaningless, and “following” such a recommendation wouldn’t have absolved Dr. Walensky of her responsibility for the decision."
2021-09-24 13:44:45,"The CDC press release distinguishes between those who SHOULD and those who MAY get the Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot. I’m in the SHOULD category, and am thrilled to be eligible today.

Thankfully Dr. Walensky made the right call. Well done! Her quote from the 9/24 release:

“As CDC Director, it is my job to recognize where our actions can have the greatest impact. At CDC, we are tasked with analyzing complex, often imperfect data to make concrete recommendations that optimize health. In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good.“"
2021-09-24 13:47:47,"Actually, the CDC Director thankfully did her job and the FDA did their job of what they are supposed to do.

It is the media that likes to accentuate the controversy between the two.  They both have different jobs and objectives."
2021-09-24 13:52:01,"Good for her.   This is either a public health emergency or not and if it is, we need boosters.   I tune out scientists and ""medical experts""  when they talk about the pandemic impact in general terms and if boosters will help.     My emphasis is the individual.  To be very blunt - I want my protection."
2021-09-24 13:56:22,"Boosters for those willing to do the dangerous work of caring for patients?  This seems obvious. Not to support those who put their lives at risk to help others?  It is like telling them their work does not matter. 
I am so glad of this ruling. I am so grateful for healthcare workers dedication despite personal danger."
2021-09-24 13:58:44,"I've been on the fence about Dr. Walensky, and I'm still not convinced she's a very good communicator -- but kudos to her for this decision."
2021-09-24 14:01:00,"For those questioning the seemingly arbitrary age of 65 for boosters even though some recommend starting at 60 or younger, I have the answer: Medicare.
It's easy to promise coverage for an additional medical expense when you control the purse strings. Government forcing private insurance companies to pay for boosters could be much trickier politically, even if they end up being reimbursed for the cost of the shot."
2021-09-24 14:05:08,"THANK YOU, Dr. Walensky. As a teacher in an overcrowded NYC public school, my vaccinated colleagues, their families, and I are beyond grateful. A few years ago, during the Bloomberg years, our union gave out pins that said, ""Ask a teacher."" I wish someone would ask us how we are feeling now, particularly those of us who teach in schools that are well over capacity and unable to socially distance, never mind the students and staff who choose not to mask or mask properly. Here are some words I've heard only this morning: scared, depressed, frustrated, angry, resigned, disgusted. Nobody asked me, but there you have it."
2021-09-24 13:51:31,Good for Dr Wollensky. It is the first truly smart thing she’s done - publicly.
2021-09-24 13:56:23,"Dr. Walensky did the right thing. It's disappointing to hear the specious arguments about boosters for essential workers and projects  entitled physicians and scientists who do not have to endure forced interaction with hundreds of unvaccinated and infected Americans. The data from other countries needs to be reviewed through the lens of the broken, divided and fractured US. Most countries reporting essential and timely researcher not dealing with huge populations of vax deniers and delusional sociopaths. Does their evidence include the thousands of schools facing infections, shut downs, return to remote learning, teacher shortages, medical worker shortages, and unmasked and infected students, parents and patients?"
2021-09-24 14:03:16,"We follow the science, not like Trump who made political decisions…oh wait the Biden White House wants it? Well then ahem, gee then maybe experts can be wrong and there are Grey areas and some data is conflicting. 

Doesn’t anyone have the integrity to point out that  “following the science” always has a political component. There is no strict following the science."
2021-09-24 13:44:53,"We need to send more doses to other countries, as soon as possible.   Doses are limited, and the more boosters we give out, the longer people in other countries will wait for their first dose.  Sadly, your “peace of mind”, “play it safe” booster comes at the cost of possible death for someone else."
2021-09-24 13:51:38,"Walensky showed some basic common sense absent from the committee of experts that was willing to hang overworked and stressed hospital workers out to dry. Further proving how committees of experts are often blinded by data and forget real world experiences. 

Is it really any wonder that many Americans with a casual understanding of anything are losing faith in experts?"
2021-09-24 13:57:39,"This is a incredible lesson about science and society. For all the high-minded talk about ""The Science"", in fact in many important situations, uncertainty and differences in perspectives implies that in many cases that well-intentioned and highly-experienced and informed parties will disagree about the proper course of action.   

We elect officials to sort though all this and make a decision.  Folks, your vote counts. It's either this guy or the guy suggesting you drink bleach."
2021-09-24 14:05:20,"So politics over science.

Let's hope it works out."
2021-09-24 14:08:29,"If, because of waning effectiveness, you are going to give booster shots to the elderly and those with pre existing conditions at any age, why wouldn't you give boosters to those who are in occupations that risk repeated exposure to unmasked and unvaccinated individuals?  Why wait for evidence of occupational exposure risk, when commonsense says there is a risk?"
2021-09-24 14:09:13,"Well done, Dr. Walensky!  Thank you for using your discretion to logically add groups that arguably have among the highest exposures to Covid-19 and, in turn, had the greatest capacity to infect others despite their best efforts."
2021-09-24 13:55:22,"With the most competent and beloved president and vicepresident in the history of this country, any hurdles will be easily cleared. Soon they will have a more than deserved 99% approval rating. Go USA!"
2021-09-24 13:53:39,She's obviously playing politics (with us) to please her boss. If Trump was still President the media would have demanded her resignation.
2021-09-24 13:48:07,It seems to weaken the confidence in a two-dose vaccination. Do we have data on breakthrough infections of the fully vaccinated? Dr. Walensky appears to be in panic mode.
2021-09-24 14:03:00,"People: stop.  This is not about politics. Consider who we are talking about here. Dr. Walensky has spent about 98 percent of her career as a leading physician-scientist in world-class academic settings, and about 2 percent as, yes, a political appointee who was appointed BECAUSE of the breadth and depth of that experience. She is not a political hack who is ignoring the voice of “real” scientists.  She probably has more credentials than everyone on that advisory panel put together.  She deserves credit for leveraging that experience and judgment to ensure the safety of clinicians and patients.  Advisory committees are just that — advisory."
2021-09-24 13:53:53,"The Biden administration ""follows the science"" until the science doesn't agree with their own political objectives.  This includes masks, vaccines and shutdowns.  What a joke."
2021-09-24 14:12:00,"For those who agree with the decision, bold leadership.  For those who don't, the decision is sullied by politics.  But, each party acted legitimately and consistent with their assigned role.  The Committee evaluated and recommended. The Director decided.  And, given that the Committee's recommendation was not unanimous, neither decision would have been completely unreasonable.  Further, there is no direct evidence of untoward political interference or pressure, which cannot be said during the first half of the pandemic."
2021-09-24 14:13:27,"This is absurd. Not offering boosters to vaccinated people at risk because the real solution is to vaccinate people who refuse to be vaccinated is like saying there's no reason to put air bags in cars because there are people who refuse to wear seat belts.

Dr. Walensky did the right thing, but it's this kind of thing --- the head of the CDC overruling the CDC's advisory panel --- that fuels the skeptics who say the government doesn't know what it's doing.

It's all well and good to continue trying to convince the refuseniks to get vaccinated, but I'm not going to stand around and wait for them to finally get on board before taking every precaution I can to protect myself from their reckless irresponsibility. In fact, the very fact that so many people refuse to get vaccinated makes it even more necessary to do everything possible.

Aside from that, the advisory committee's recommendations seem to be detached from reality. Excluding teachers, health care and frontline workers because so many of them are healthy? No boosters for at-risk people who got the Moderna or J&J shot, even though a Pfizer booster would work? Fears that giving protective booster shots would tax a health care system overburdened by people who won't get vaccinated? Worries that a broad recommendation would throw open the doors? Of course, by all means, let's make it as difficult and restrictive as possible!

Thank you, Dr. Wallensky."
2021-09-24 14:14:24,"I do not understand how the CDC panel decided that medical workers and teachers, etc would not be at risk of contracting covid, despite having a relatively high level of exposure. Once the false claim of rare breakthrough infections from Delta was debunked, we learned that those already vaccinated could indeed contract covid. The chances were much reduced, and the chances of hospitalization even less, but they do exist. If there were any evidence of health risks from getting a booster, then they would have had to weigh which choice would lead to the better net outcome. But there was no such evidence. Congratulations to the director for actually considering the evidence and not just being a rubber stamp."
2021-09-24 14:15:47,"It would have made much more sense to keep the deliberations of the advisory panels private, for the heads of the FDA and CDC to meet regarding any differences in their own views, and for someone (whether one of them or the president) to speak for the federal government with one voice.  It does not promote confidence to have so many experts publicly disagreeing with each other."
2021-09-24 14:17:03,"CDC decision makes a lot of sense. I do not understand why a committee designated for public health could vote against it.
Everyone should be able to take the 3rd dose, if they need to enhance their protection according to their personal circumstances and considering the waning occurs after 6-8 months. I can only mention the personnel of a nursing home as an example. Especially before the cold months ahead and the more time soent indoors. It is better to avoid any mild breakthrough infection. It is the only chance we have  to tame and hopefully cancel covid for good."
2021-09-24 14:14:09,"I was skeptical of dr walenski before but now i'm convinced she's just another political hack.
the real problem is the unvaccinated and this is only going to make that situation worse. it makes the government look inept and the anti-vaxers are going to have a field day. besides, we'll always have colds and flu and minor illnesses and all we need is enough protection  to clear out our hospitals"
2021-09-24 14:11:55,"All about the politics not science, as shown here. Nothing new there."
2021-09-24 14:13:49,I am retired so do not have to be out and about. I support boosters for bus drivers and grocery store workers who have to be exposed to fools who refuse to get vaccinated.
2021-09-24 14:23:26,"We are in the middle of a pandemic.  More than 650,000 people in the US have died.  Yet here we are, slicing and dicing the population to see who's more worthy of extra help.

All willing adults should be able to get booster shots.

387 million shots have been administered in the US, with  enormous benefits and almost no serious side effects.  The benefit to risk ratio for all individuals is positive and greater in some.  I'm not aware of any adult groups where the risks outweigh the benefits.

The UK has announced boosters for everyone over 50 and Israel is rolling it out for all adults.  Both of these countries appear to have much better surveillance and public heath systems than the US.

It seems that the advisors, scientists and bureaucrats are missing the forest for the trees.  Their risk aversion--given the most extensive rollout of a vaccine in history, with great benefits and very few risks--seems completely at variance with the needs created by the pandemic."
2021-09-24 14:29:46,"Remember the convoluted logic behind the ""don't wear a mask, it won't protect you"" advice in February and March 2020? That wearing a mask could actually make you less safe by giving you a false sense of security? That was motivated by considerations of global PPE shortages, NOT personal safety. It is exactly the same situation now, authorities taking a stance ""for the greater (global) good"", not considering the risk reduction for individuals. I can make decisions for only one individual, me, and that individual decided to get a booster.

Masks do in fact protect against COVID, but the authorities didn't want individuals buying up limited supplies. I didn't wear the mask I owned flying back from Asia end of February 2020 because of that advice. Guess what? I got a prolonged upper respiratory infection, and some weeks later completely lost my sense of smell, and have still not recovered. No COVID tests available then unless you were needing acute medical care. I have been fully vaccinated with Pfizer as of about six months ago. Did I wait for Mother May I to get a booster? Not on my life."
2021-09-24 14:32:01,"I'm a critical care nurse and from what little was said, I'd support Walensky. A  stressed overworked ICU is at much higher risk of exposure and breakthrough infection. Statistics may not be reflecting that yet. You have no idea how easy it is to have small breaks of protection when you’re running from alarming patient to patient to code. I've always joked that we must have a super immune system to survive. We’d appreciate if you all would leave the political bias remarks behind and just deal with medical reality."
2021-09-24 14:33:25,"Looking more and more like the Rham Emmanuel dictum; "" use a crisis to advantage to implement non related political goals"".
 This reeks of politics and should be resisted. Democrats give lip service to science but just can't resist accumulating political power above all."
2021-09-24 14:33:48,"This is leadership.  

I listened to the ACIP meeting streaming, and was dismayed by the frequency of comments from advisors that were irrelevant or orthogonal to the discussion.  They might vote against the recommendation because it ignores other people vaccinated with J&J or Moderna?  The real solution is to vaccinate the unvaccinated?  Healthcare workers already have PPE, so therefore don't need protection? Mild infection (where you can still transmit to others) is not that big of an issue?

Sometimes advisory panels give great advice, sometimes their advice is simply mostly good, and sometimes it is terrible.  With its current organizational structure, the ultimate decision about how to interpret that advice lies squarely on the shoulders of the leader of the institution.   

Dr. Walensky appropriately considered the data, advice, and greater context of this recommendation.  She then appropriately made a well thought out decision.  I am grateful that she is in this position."
2021-09-24 14:35:42,"The key point is that there isn’t overwhelming evidence that a booster will significantly help. The argument is “Why do something if maybe it isn’t helpful.” vs “Why not if it isn’t harmful.”
I like the latter as it drives home the fact that the vaccines are safe. (and we have extra doses that are going to waste)
Meanwhile, while we parse and agonize over the minutiae of the booster benefits of possibly reducing 2,000 hospitalizations per million vaccinated people,
2,000 unvaccinated Americans are dying every day.
Does the focus on boosters indicate that we’ve given up on them?"
2021-09-24 14:35:45,"The discussion on this has been hard to parse.

They recommend boosters for part of the vaccinated population which indicates they believe the boosters can help people and the positive effects outweigh the negative.

But then they don't want to recommend for younger, healthier, but highly exposed people because -- the data is not robust enough to publish? Figuring out messaging difficulties? Questions about global equity?

These questions are important but it is also important to remember we are still in a deep emergency. I am concerned about getting more people vaccinated, but people who followed guidance early on, stayed cautious, and got vaccinated early deserve some consideration as well instead of being delayed from intervention that may help them because panel members worry about sending ""bad messages"" to people who remain willfully unvaccinated."
2021-09-24 14:36:15,"Language matters. This isn't overruling or reversing - its expanding. The panel was split when making this decision, its not Walensky vs a unanimous board ruling."
2021-09-24 14:38:23,"Many police, firefighters, EMTs, nurses and doctors are thankful for this decision. Our extended family includes members of all these professions. 
We accepted our vaccinations as soon as possible, some of us in December 2020. 
We are frustrated with anti vaxers of all types, but will continue to respond and to provide care to everyone possible, regardless of vaccination status or political views. 
We have endured over a year of public distrust and even hatred, and many threats to us personally.  Conspiracy theories on the right and the left.  Please think carefully, and be careful about inflammatory rhetoric.  It does not help, and some unstable people do act on the outrage and carry out their threats.  Be careful."
2021-09-24 14:26:17,"The hospital census is high, and we can barely find enough staff to cover our patient load as it is, and that's with offering $1000 daily bonuses. It is not a matter of bonus pay; there are just not enough available doctors in the community who are willing to pick up extra shifts. If one of us picks up even a mild case of breakthrough COVID, it would be catastrophic to our ability to adequately take care of our patients. And God forbid that breakthrough case turns into multiple breakthrough cases. Give us what it takes to stay as safe as possible so that staffing can stay at safe levels for our patients.

For what it's worth, I'm supportive of universal boosters for everyone, regardless of occupation."
2021-09-24 14:27:42,"I think she was absolutely right. I mean I understand how science works and how data-driven it has to be. But common sense says that people who are repeatedly exposed to the virus because it's their job to treat people who had the virus, and all who are repeatedly exposed to folks who are notorious for transmitting illness, children, should definitely be eligible for a booster shot. children will literally wipe their snotty faces on your clothes. And think nothing of it. The data isn't there because we haven't been at it long enough. But we've all been human long enough to know how these things work. By now it's pretty clear that people who are unvaccinated aren't going to get vaccinated until after they suffer through this terrible disease, if at all. We can't help them any more than we already have. It's time to focus on people who actually want to stay healthy."
2021-09-24 14:35:55,"Trust  in government is a key in fighting Covid

Nor does  ""A highly unusual decision"""
2021-09-24 14:21:24,A political decision to help Biden save face for foolishly saying EVERYONE should get the booster. Looks like even SANE politicians can get tempted to make decisions before the science is settled.
2021-09-24 14:39:48,I don’t understand why these agencies can’t get their act together.  Is anyone in charge?
2021-09-24 14:23:43,"What is at stake here? 
People who are above 65 and those with medical conditions are advised to take the booster shots. 
It is better to be safe than reject taking the shot for this age group. 
Keep in mind most Americans at this age are unfit and obese which is the fact of life. 
We all have been taking booster shots all our lives this is no different to prevent people from dying  or occupy  ICU unnecessarily."
2021-09-24 14:30:44,"Why s there no reporting on why Moderna and J&J are lagging behind Pfizer?
Why is there no reporting on the status of vaccine manufacturing capacity?
Why is there no reporting on efforts to ramp up production?

I think the answer is that it's too much work.  Far easier to write news stories like this one."
2021-09-24 14:41:05,"The practical aspect of this approach is lost. Showing one's work papers or badge at a vaccination site is not a thing. 
Walensky effectively opened up third shots for everyone but children. 

Taking into account the Israeli experience and our continued high  exposure due to our tolerance of anti-vaxxers I think third shots for everyone is the right approach. I would like to see more data on mixing and matching vaccines though. Maybe giving most people a different shot from what they had before is more effective."
2021-09-24 14:46:56,"Thank you dr. Walensky! Thank you.
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices should change its name to Advisory Committee on Immunization Policies.
Their recommendation was not based on science. Data is not science, waiting for more data when people die is not science, expectation that vaccine knows that is good for adults of specific age but might not be necessary to those under that age is downright anti-science. This is not the first time that ACIP recommendation is specifically listing adult age discrimination that is not based on medical or any other science. It might be because of finances, but they never showed any figures for that. Compare the HPV vaccine age limitations. As if they knew that virus knows and follows its victim's date of birth."
2021-09-24 14:49:17,"Good decision, definitely smarter than lifting indoor masking in May. 

So when will the vaccine be added to the required childhood vaccinations? At least for age 16 and above as the vaccine is now fully authorized."
2021-09-24 14:49:35,"It's hard to keep up. First the administrations flip flops on the booster shots. We need them now? My county has their own requirements which until this decision made it easier to get a booster shot. I'll have to wait and see for my turn.

I don't believe Biden and Trump were unaware of these complications in the CDC. How do you deal with contradictory information?  Who do they believe?  Both President's had pressure from poorer countries with little access to the vaccine and the need to distribute it to them. Which played a part in the booster decision.

Biden announced 500 million shots to be distributed but that's far from enough. And they're still trying not to charge  the patents to make it more affordable for poor countries.

I think if you looked at it both Presidents did the best they  could do and if you look at it their response similar. They had the same advisors. People have been trying to make it black and white. Nothing ever is."
2021-09-24 14:46:14,"Why do we have so many different entities considering the same issue?  Maybe we should make a few more groups to have a real pea soup of government and give them advisory groups and then absolutely no one can know what's safe, advised or anything.  I supervise a small work team that (unlike me) has not gotten vaccinated and has significant repeated contact with people (they do in person job training).  I tell them regularly go get vaccinated for your own and your families sake, but they don't.  They are scared.  When this sort of gobbledy goop comes out, they say, ""see nobody knows what to do and we are going to find out in a few years time that vaccines give us strokes or whatever...many people in healthcare aren't vaccinated, etc...etc.""  The vaccine deniers are speaking in very clear straight forward language:  Vaccine bad.  We need to not be going back and forward and doubling over ourselves."
2021-09-24 14:46:45,"Frontline health care workers and teachers deserve everything we can give them in terms of protection. And the US alone is sending 300 million vaccine doses abroad before year's end so domestic boosters will not prevent us helping the rest of the world.  It should be very possible to verify the age, occupation and vaccine status of those presenting to get a booster.   And this boost in immunity will make breakthrough infections (including hard to detect asymptomatic ones) much less common. Bravo Walensky and Biden! Smart move."
2021-09-24 14:50:10,"What is of concern to me is the criteria used by this panel in their deliberations on who should get a booster shot. Was it the additional protection to individuals and if so how much protection and at what risk to those individuals or did it include larger systemic issues. I am thinking these might have included the impact on the healthcare system to the provision of these shots or the morality of providing boosters when much of the world hasn’t been vaccinated.

As the article pointed out there appears to be a surfeit of vaccines that will be available for the rest of the year and they should be sent abroad. I don’t see where it would unduly stress the healthcare system to offer boosters to anyone who chooses, if that person after being presented with the risks, decides that they want one. Persons who have previously chosen to be vaccinated have done their part and this should be honored by offering the additional jab. Especially if this additional jab reduces the incidence of breakthrough infections in the population."
2021-09-24 14:45:54,"A disgraceful decision, blurring the health risk message of the CDC's pwm advisors for purely political reasons. No wonder trust in the CDC is low. This will lower it further. We deserve better."
2021-09-24 14:35:54,"Either we're going to follow the science or we're not and it looks like the Biden administration is not going to follow the promise he ran on.  The idea is to get everyone vaccinated against Covid, but when Biden couldn't get that to happen he started rolling out mandates and then it came to vaccinating children and boosters he ran us down yet another rabbit hole slicing up who should and should not receive the jab.  Now it's come to a point where even medical professionals don't agree on the science so the Biden administration is ignoring them and going their own way.

Here's the deal, the Covid-19 virus doesn't care about the politics, the science, the age or profession of the individual, we're all fair game.  Joe Biden and his administration ineptness at handling evolving crises whether they be military, immigration, political or medical is a stellar example of kakistocracy."
2021-09-24 14:32:04,"Data I've seen is that highest risk workers are categories like bakers and food workers.   

These are left out of news stories that focus on ""health care workers and teachers.""  

This is very similar to ""missing white women syndrome.""   If the #1 issue is bakery and kitchen workers and #2 issue is grocery store workers then upper class white media will lead with ""teachers and health workers"".   Bad."
2021-09-24 14:32:23,"As II am reading this, Dr. Walensky is acting as the head of the Venter for Disease Control so she is trying to control disease spread and is extending those protections to at-risk essential workers. 

She is not the head of the Center for Fixing Dysfunctional Government and Self-Centered Deluded People Who Recklessly Endanger Others. That is Congress and Executive and Supreme Court. 

Oh yes,, she is not head of Center for Fixing a Terminally Dysfunctional Healthcare System or the Center for Dangerously Deranged Military Spendng Priorities.

Unfortunately she is not head of the Center for Addressing Health Inequities on a Global Scale.

Maybe I just don’t get it.  Seems like she is just doing her job in a de-politicized way."
2021-09-24 14:52:08,"I no longer have any trust for the CDC, they have earned my lowest grade for their mishandling of our health in a time if crisis.

It has been obvious from the beginning of the pandemic that vaccines were needed to combat the virus and that they would be needed immediately. Their ""emergency"" approval was timey but it took them forever for final approval. Did anyone think that they would eventually NOT approve the vaccines after 60% of the population had been vaccinated? The delay in approval feed into the reluctance of some to accept the shots which resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths. 

Like the vaccines, the need for boosters was equally obvious. Amongst a world full of data, the CDC choose to ignore the collective experience and particularly data from Israel that serves as an ideal model for our country. 

Their decision on booster shots was incredibly myopic.  Everyone knows that boosters are inevitable for all and to not state that in their ""analysis"" is beyond irresponsible. Those at high risk should have been strongly encouraged to get the booster immediately. I'm a high risk person due to lung damage but I did not qualify for the early booster shot because of the limited scope they begrudgingly approved. 

The CDC needs to be recast so that it is capable of addressing the immediate needs of the country in an emergency. To do so, they would have to establish new procedures and also take advantage of data and information from other trusted countries."
2021-09-24 14:52:20,"This is a terrible idea. It shows that CDC executives are willing to bow to political pressure instead of following a deliberative, independent scientific process in evaluating the risks and benefits of large scale public health actions."
2021-09-24 15:01:13,Well played and well done Director Walensky. This family of health care providers are grateful to you!
2021-09-24 15:02:26,"People who say the panel's recommenation is scientific, and Dr. Wardell's isn't, are mistaken.
There's no evidence to suggest the booster will be less effective for people with a high occupational exposure, than for the elderly and immunocompromised.
The panel's recommendation, like Dr. Wardell's, are just one of many legitimate opinions on how to best deploy the booster."
2021-09-24 15:05:23,"Boosters should be available for all. The cost could be covered by paring back federal funding for the states whose governments resist taking reasonable precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, such as refusing to enact mask mandates for schools and sometimes even forbidding school districts from enacting them. Since they are so much in love with the Corona virus, let them pay for the need for boosters. We might not need them if everyone who could be vaccinated was."
2021-09-24 15:06:25,"The disagreements illustrated by the article and many of the comments are natural and expected, given that we don’t yet have truly long term experience with the vaccine and COVID-19 infections.

It may be interesting to reread the comments years and decades from now.  

However, the advisors and decision makers have to act in the moment without this knowledge.

My thanks go to them for their efforts to promote the best possible outcomes.  It “ain’t” easy.

2021-09-24 15:07:42,"I think the use of the word ""booster"" is confusing.  As a physician, I got my first shot in December 2019!  Second shot in 1/21.  I don't need a ""booster.""  I just need another shot like I need a flu vaccine every year.  As for people who think giving out ""booster"" shots will diminish the supply for those unvaccinated, have they talked to the unvaccinated?  Those who still aren't vaccinated will not change their minds about the vaccine, even as they gasp for air.  This is very unfortunate for the hospitals because ""booster"" shots will not lessen the number of COVID patients they have to continue to treat."
2021-09-24 15:08:05,"Very good to know that Dr. Walensky made the right decision by endorsing booster vaccines for health care workers. Now she just has to get it past the right wing Montana legislature which passed a bill earlier this year which says employers cannot require their employees to be vaccinated against anything, not even health care workers. Yes, you read that right."
2021-09-24 15:08:51,Who is leading the fight against the pandemic?  Seems like the vaccine makers have undue influence somehow.  When will a real lasting vaccine become available or are the present vaccine makers blocking it so they can have a monopoly and make zillions for their stockholders?
2021-09-24 15:10:50,"What's all this about politics interfering with the science?  Didn't the FDA panel recommended boosters for 18-64 year olds who work in institutional settings that put them at frequent risk of exposure? In a close vote, the CDC panel didn't make that recommendation.  Both sides have scientific support and Walensky went with the FDA approach, erring on the side of more protection.  That sounds perfectly reasonable and a-political."
2021-09-24 15:12:55,"This is an unfortunate decision that is getting ahead of the data. We have not yet identified a correlate of protection and the data regarding the time course of waning immunity are confounded by the emergence of delta and the relaxation of nonpharmaceutical interventions like masking and indoor dining restrictions. The vaccines are very safe but their administration always carries some degree of risk just like any other product; given that the relative risks and benefits of an additional dose remain unclear for immunocompetent individuals under the age of 65, it would have been wise for the Dr. Walensky to simply say “we do not have a recommendation yet at this time.” Given the insane magnifying glass under which they are operating, more consistent messaging by and coordination between the agencies would have been nice."
2021-09-24 15:19:24,"Good decision, especially for frontline workers at high risk of exposure due to occupational hazards (healthcare)."
2021-09-24 15:20:13,"I don't think this is a terrible idea, or a bad decision.  This CDC is far better than the last one under the past administration, so be thankful for that.  Walensky is simply extending the agreement/recommendation to include front line workers.  There's far too much hair splitting over all this.  I agree, Biden shouldn't have assumed anything on boosters until his regulatory branches decided.  But remember, front line workers like the people who've been trying to save covid patients non stop for almost 2 years should not be dismissed."
2021-09-24 15:22:17,Please do not imply that her decision is political. I would hope it's a scientific decision that we will judge based on evidence in the future.
2021-09-24 15:22:41,"The Pfizer studies showing waning have been available for months. These data were the basis of studies for boosting. FDA, CDC staffs and the public have had access to these studies to analyze in the run up to approval. The advisory panels for these organizations are just that—citizen input mechanisms without decision making powers. While it is important to advocate for equity, withholding effective vaccines in the face of a pandemic is bad policy. I applaud Dr. Walensky for taking a strong leadership position. 

Moderna will come up next. Their data is available and convincing. It should be noted that the Moderna boosting studies included 3 dosing levels, and that the selected 1/2 dose booster was about as effective as the full dose. More bang for the buck, and not an arbitrary choice."
2021-09-24 15:24:39,"I am a physician in NYC and many of my vaccination resistant patients say the same thing: the ""experts"" don't seem to know and can't agree on whether the vaccine is safe. While few experts question the efficacy and safety of the vaccinations, the inability to arrive at uniform and consistent recommendations from the executive administration, FDA, and CDC erode patient trust in COVID vaccination. It creates the perception that decisions are politically motivated and that the science is a guessing game."
2021-09-24 15:24:58,"I can only assume that this decision by Walensky is politically motivated because it is certainly not evidence-based.  Studies show that infections among teachers and health care workers are associated with community exposures NOT occupational transmission (Jacob et al March 2021 JAMA and Fenton et al BMJ Aug 2021).  Anecdotally, I'm a physician working with employee health for a large health care system and participate in contact tracing, quarantining and isolation of our employees.  We are mostly seeing employees getting infected from community exposures. If employees are exposed at work, it has usually been linked to eating lunch in together in break rooms or carpooling together.  A small fraction of our occupational transmission have been related to exposure to patients when employees do not wear recommended PPE.  There are no reports of increased hospitalizations among younger and healthy vaccinated workers that support this decision. It stirs anxiety among workers such as teachers just returning to in-person teaching.  It makes those who received Moderna or J and J anxious.  This is not the right step, CDC."
2021-09-24 15:35:44,"Our ICU is overflowing with unvaccinated Covid patients.  We continue to delay needed surgeries because there is no room for them.  Several of my double vaccinated physician colleagues have had breakthrough Covid with one progressing to Covid pneumonia.  Thank you Dr Walensky for this very sane correct decision for our respiratory therapists, nurses, physicians, and other health workers who are still very much in the thick of the pandemic!"
2021-09-24 15:36:40,"My daughter is a grocery store manager. She and her staff have been serving the food needs of the public since the pandemic began. They constantly face customers who resist mask wearing. I thank Dr. Walensky for allowing my daughter and every front line worker (and especially in health care), to get a booster shot to avoid breakthrough infections, or reduce their seriousness."
2021-09-24 15:38:42,"The deliberation yesterday did not instill a lot of confidence. We need more in-depth information on the CDC and FDA advisory committees. Some of the suggestions, like withholding boosters for Pfizer because Moderna wasn't reviewed yet, do not seem to have public health as the goal. Why are there so many pediatricians as members? If this decision is based on waning immunity, how will those who were vaccinated the earliest be ensured of getting boosters quickly?"
2021-09-24 15:42:07,"Good decision. I have already had a third booster shot because I am over 50 with genetic underlying conditions, and there must be doses otherwise going unused in my area. It’s the socially just thing to do to make boosters available to all front line workers, many of whom are underpaid and under-respected. Plus, vaccinating front line workers helps keep everyone safer, especially people who are chronically ill or disabled, as we usually need more personal assistance from others and have a lot more contact with the medical system."
2021-09-24 15:42:56,I agree with Dr. Walensky who has the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The advisory committee's decision seems unreasonable and puts healthcare workers and others at risk.
2021-09-24 15:02:26,"Never mind Dr. Wolensky.

What does DR. FAUCI recommend ?

Any American who  wants a booster  can get one by walking into
CVS, Walgreens, etc."
2021-09-24 15:03:20,"I fail to see the scandal in the CDC director overruling the advisory panel to authorize booster shots for a few more groups at risk. Eventually, boosters likely will need to be authorized for all, the way unscrupulous Republican politicians and Trumpist numbskulls have been dragging out this pandemic by refusing vaccinations and masks. The scandal would have been a CDC director overruling an advisory panel to authorize boosters for fewer groups at risk."
2021-09-24 15:13:20,"The real story here is not whether or not another shot is warranted. The real story is the CDC Director not following her own advisory panel.  What happened to we will follow the science. Please imagine the outrage that would have ensued if this were a Trump appointee who over ruled their own committee. All this does is further move the country to not believe the experts. If the CDC is going to be a political arm of the Adminstion, the NYT should treat it as such."
2021-09-24 14:53:17,"This confusion over the booster shots is a good example of why so many US citizens are suspicious of the whole process, and contribute just as much towards vaccine hesitancy as any kind of misinformation.  After all, if the federal authorities can't make up their minds, why should they be believed?  This whole booster discussion is a bit besides the point anyway because Americans who believe in the Covid vaccine and want boosters just need to go into a clinic and get one.  I went into one in a grocery store where the workers were just sitting around with nothing to do, and they were happy to oblige me with a 'jab'."
2021-09-24 14:53:33,"From CDC website:

1. ""The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) includes 15 voting members""

2. ""Fourteen of the members have expertise in vaccinology, immunology, pediatrics, internal medicine, nursing, family medicine, virology, public health, infectious diseases, and/or preventive medicine""

Conclusion: Walensky is ignoring the advice from scientists and experts in vaccinology, immunology, etc.

So much for ""following the science"".

This is 'Politics Trumps Science'."
2021-09-24 14:58:40,"This makes no sense to me. The public health establishment has  been underselling the vaccines and their TOTAL AMAZINGNESS for month now. It's doing really harm to efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated (because they think ""How many times am I going to have to do this? Do they even work?""); and it's also turning the vaccinated into total neurotics. Almost every adult I know is vaccinated, and the ones who don't read the news closely have no idea how well they are protected. A number of people in my highly vaccinated community are returning to semi-lockdown hermitic conditions because they don't understand how well they're protected from a breakthrough and wrongly believe that a breakthrough might kill them. Not to mention the implication for school openings by suggesting that two-dose-vaxxed teachers aren't robustly protected!!! This decision -- made by overruling the government's OWN EXPERTS -- is just awful on every dimension of public health."
2021-09-24 15:01:13,Thank you Dr.Walensky for expanding the panel’s decision to cover more peoples.
2021-09-24 15:24:34,I keep seeing a hole in the age brackets.  OVER 65 leaves out 65-year-olds.  Okay.  But compromised folks ages 50 to 64 ALSO leaves out 65-year-olds.  Why are they not at least included in the compromised group?
2021-09-24 15:11:41,Dr. Walensky finally makes a good decision.  Why would the panel make such a decision- looks like they have to justify their positions/ egos ? We now have enough vaccines to give boosters to all who want them.  What is going on here.  Only gives more ammunition /confusion for the public especially the ones that refuse to get vaccinated.   I am disgusted by everything at this point as time passes - this is not living.
2021-09-24 15:20:32,"Admittedly, I am not a scientist, but I struggle to understand the advisory committee's recommendation to NOT give boosters to frontline workers when we have data that the initial vaccines's efficacy wanes and boosters help.  Yes, send vaccines to poor countries, but you also need to provide the roll out for those vaccines; they're no good until they're in arms.  It's my understanding that vaccines are being discarded daily because they pass their expiration date.  Why not use them on people willing to have a booster?
And what's with the delay in approving Moderna and J&J?  I hope folks in charge aren't on vacation and taking weekends off.  Sorry, but sometimes burning the candle at both ends is what's called for."
2021-09-24 15:26:54,"This is the perfect example that ""The Science"" (capital T capital S stands for the politicization of science, not actual science) is about picking the study or report you agree with, ignoring science you disagree with, then using that agreeable science to justify your decision and then say it was based on The Science.

Of course everyone will applaud the decision because the outcome is what people wanted and The Science is about the outcome and not science."
2021-09-24 15:17:30,"This comes under the category ""it's better to be safe, not sorry"".

Besides, I have yet to see any account of anyone having suffered harm as a result of a vaccine overdose."
2021-09-24 15:00:28,"Where, exactly, is the high drama here?  What Dr. Walensky did is known as an executive decision, and sometimes executive decisions don't align with a certain consensus.  That's it."
2021-09-24 15:46:45,"Thank you Dr Walensky. 

Last week I had a very high risk exposure doing my job as a GI doc. Patient had a negative test Monday and a colonoscopy Wednesday. Hours after the procedure he developed high fevers. He was admitted 2 days later with Covid pneumonia. I had 2 days of fatigue and headache but tested negative. All 7 of us who were exposed were absolutely terrified. Our patient was at max infectiousness.  All of us were vaccinated and double masked, but with Delta anything is possible, especially 9 months after vaccinations.

If Dr Walensky had not overturned the CDC recommendation, I and 10 million other health care workers would have shown up at CVS and lied about our vaccination status in order to get a booster. Many others would have simply quit."
2021-09-24 15:22:05,"I can’t keep up, this is a case study in poor messaging and PR."
2021-09-24 15:46:30,"Of course they're pushing this through.  More money for Pfizer and everyone in the gov't who is on their payroll or has stock.  Why aren't we looking at what they've accomplished in Uttar Pradesh, India where in a population of close to 200 million they are down to 194 active cases of Covid as of Sept. 21st.  What are they doing?  Giving Ivermectin, a drug that has been used in people for YEARS safely, prophylatically and to those sick.  daily test positivity rate in the state has dipped to less to less than 
194 cases.  OUT OF 200 million!  Daily positivity rate has dipped to less than .001% -- from a high of 16.84% in April.  How about following the science?????  Something's working and something's NOT."
2021-09-24 15:04:58,"Note: The official CDC statement is vague and doesn't specifically reference particular occupations such as ""teachers"":

""people aged 18-64 years who are at increased risk for COVID-19 exposure and transmission because of occupational or institutional setting may receive a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine at least 6 months after their Pfizer-BioNTech primary series, based on their individual benefits and risks.""

2021-09-24 15:26:21,"Biden made a huge mistake announcing boosters would be available for all in mid September. He made that announcement as a political calculation at the time to show he was ""doing something"" to address the Delta surge and in doing so he dared the FDA and CDC to disagree with him. Well, that happened when both agencies rejected boosters for all adults. Walensky made this decision to allow boosters for people in certain occupations to provide political cover to Biden so he can spin it as a ""win"" in the media. This decision by Walensky is an example of why many people view her as mainly a political animal who is no different than the typical blowhard in Congress."
2021-09-24 15:03:15,Politics overrules science. Period.
2021-09-24 15:46:49,"So I hope there are lots of howls about the death of voting and democracy, since once again, a ""chief"" rejects ""votes"" and just ""mandates"" from the hip for political posturing.  Great nation we've destroyed here....

The reason is that the vaccine works well for those with better immune systems, not whether you are exposed or not.  If you are exposed, you need a good immune response, that which the vaccine provides unless you are old and have a poor immune system.

So all her over-ruling has done is make it CLEAR that the vaccine DOES NOT WORK WELL....as if you are only protected if you are already healthy and aren't exposed to the virus. Some CDC message..."
2021-09-24 15:04:38,History has shown it is best to wait a few days after Walensky makes a major statement to see whether CDC staff walk it back or let it stand as is.
2021-09-24 15:21:47,"""at risk"" is a slippery slope."
2021-09-24 15:30:25,"Why is the information in the following NPR article about the possible continued future immunity from the vaccine not being discussed by the CDC, FDA or the media?

2021-09-24 15:58:48,"In Israel, most of the serious breakthrough cases are in people over 60 with chronic illness.  Many were bedridden.   This remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated and ""at risk"" vaccinated.  

People who are not in these high risk categories have convinced themselves they are at risk and/or entitled to a booster because they come into contact with unvaccinated people.  Neither of these positions are supported by the data at this point."
2021-09-24 16:00:01,"Without a booster, there will be a higher rate of exposure to and transmission by infected individuals to workers having to make close contact with them. That is a fact and it is unethical to wait for more data to convince decision makers. We do not need a single healthcare worker disabled or destroyed by Covid-19 who could have been protected by a booster shot."
2021-09-24 16:00:33,"This is my problem with the vaccines.  Recommendations are made and then they are side stepped, because they don't meet with the current political agenda. (I voted for Biden).

The FDA's approval of the vaccine was also rushed through so that people would feel comfortable in getting vaccinated.  However, when the normal process is disregarded for a quick approval, the FDA's ruling feels manipulated and false.  The FDA's approval carries little weight or comfort for those who are hesitant about being vaccinated.

Why bother to ask for a CDC guideline on administering vaccines if you aren't going to follow their guidelines?  How much money was wasted creating the guideline. which the CDC director decided to circumvent to her own wishes?  This is why the lack of credibility with the vaccines and our vaccine authorities exists."
2021-09-24 16:01:54,"Completely outrageous and morally reprehensible.  More evidence that science does not matter and this pandemic is now just about politics and fear.

The CDC, FDA and WHO scientific panels say a booster is not needed for healthy adults because the scientific evidence supports that recommendation.

Meanwhile, billions of people in the world do not have access to a single shot and millions of at-risk individuals throughout the world are at risk of dying so a healthy person in the US gets an unnecessary 3rd shot, not to mention all of the shots given to children who are at less risk than the flu per the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics.

This is an epic moral failure on behalf of the U.S, enabled by the U.S. corporate media."
2021-09-24 15:48:09,"And the downside of recommending a booster shot is?  The article fails to clearly answer this question.

(I welcome any clarification on this point.)"
2021-09-24 16:09:06,"When a political appointee overrules her professional staff, you can bet that the appointee is doing the bidding of the President who appointed her rather than following the science. That is as true today as it was during the Trump administration."
2021-09-24 16:09:47,"My SIL, who is fully vaccinated, is a preschool teacher at a church-own school in the Central Valley. The kids are not required to wear masks. There was an outbreak of COVID-19 at the school.  My SIL and her husband both are diligent about wearing surgical masks.  She caught COVID, then he did.  She is asthmatic and currently in hospital with COVID. The local hospital is at 150% capacity to date.  I sure wish she'd had the booster shot!"
2021-09-24 15:56:20,"Follow the scientists and science, right?"
2021-09-24 15:58:02,"I believe the FDA later this fall will do a 180. Early studies show boosters work, and are going to be needed. Why the FDA is in complete denial after the recent studies out of Israel to other countries basically realizing a booster will be needed is asinine. 

I understand they want to focus on higher risk people first, but that should include front line workers too. And honestly after the 8 month period should include everyone. 

I normally don't question the FDA or CDC during the pandemic, but this was really dumb on their part. Horrible communication, seems to deny actual studies and science, and why let people get less protected over time? Pure stupidity."
2021-09-24 16:03:31,I would think the times would be embarrassed at how different they are approaching this administration compared to how these headlines would be if this were Trump. So this Director think she knows more than over a dozen other medical doctors who actually specialize in this field? So what if a young person does take the booster based on her advisement and has a reaction? Maybes impaired or even dies? Is She individually responsible. Why is this OK?
2021-09-24 15:58:58,"What does “at risk” mean? My wife works in an ER. If she’s “at risk”, am I? And if the definition is based on close contact with the public, what about retail workers? Restaurant staff? 

This convoluted approach will result in more confusion, at a time when we can least afford it."
2021-09-24 15:59:45,"This smells like a political decision by a political appointee to save Biden's face for declaring boosters for everybody ahead of the regulatory process. Otherwise, there is no good reason to overrule the career professionals."
2021-09-24 16:05:32,It seems Dr. Wolensky swallowed some lumps after her premature declaration to go unmasked indoors if vaccinated back in May. This is an excellent decision. Thank you Dr. Wolensky.
2021-09-24 16:08:09,"With hospitalizations recently approaching capacity limits in many states and with total hospitalizations at 90,688 as per today's NY Times ( 09/24/2021), the data regarding the booster's ability to reduce hospitalizations seem very pertinent. With a population of about  332.8 million, with the fully vaccinated rate at 55%, and if ""the additional shots could prevent more than 2,000 hospitalizations for every million doses given."" then overall about 366,080 hospitalizations could be avoided if  boosters are given to all of the fully vaccinated. Or, with about 50% of total vaccinations, about 183,040 hospitalizations could be prevented, using only the Phizer data.

[55%(% fully vac)   x    332.8 million (US pop)   x    2,000/1,000,000 (boost hosp eff)] =
366,080 hosp preventions
 
And, recently the median length of hospital stay for survivors was 10-13 days.

2021-09-24 16:19:23,"The blame should not be directed at Dr Walensky  who is sticking her neck out to keep vital health care workers safe but to the irresponsible millions of Americans who refuse to get vaccinated !
It is the anti vaxxers who are directly responsible for prolonging the pandemic recovery."
2021-09-24 16:19:33,"For all the people who've been complaining about Rochelle Walensky, this! Good work.

Time to stop looking for somebody to blame and work together to solve problems."
2021-09-24 16:23:14,"Probably the right thing to do considering that the ""infectors"" are now mostly crazy & dangerous. It does look political but I would side with those who think they need a booster because of their employment. I'm not one of them."
2021-09-24 16:08:32,Good for you Doctor!  I admire your courage and your cute too!
2021-09-24 16:21:44,"In Dec 2020 the FDA and CDC waited for the completion of the RCT in the first series of vaccines. Currently, there are ongoing RCT for booster doses! It would have been better to wait for class 1 data that booster doses actually work (there are data from RCT to support boosters for immunocompromised). We don't know if the VE for symptomatic infection is waning or will wane in all peoples, if giving a third dose of current vaccines will affect delta transmission, or if a third dose will actually do anything for pubic or individual health. After listening to the FDA Advisory meetings and the ACIP meeting, it is clear that the members are doing their best to act on a question that has been prematurely asked of them without class 1 scientific data. For males under the age of 50, the risk may outweigh the benefits. It is good that the CDC is not mandating booster doses but it would be better if the political situation was less adversarial toward the science. Finally, the POTUS announcement in August likely did more damage to the US pandemic response than the boosters can help. At the same time that the FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine, many Americans heard that vaccines no longer work. The original course of vaccines are still working and preventing thousands of hospitalizations and deaths! We need to forcefully and consistently state that the first course of vaccines still work amazingly well and nearly all data still points to high vaccine efficacy (H/T Chise)!"
2021-09-24 16:23:10,"Why are academic - and hence consultative - politics so vicious?  Because there’s only ego at stake. 
Manifestly the head of the CDC did the right thing. Uncertain what defenses the Committee has for ignoring what every layman instinctively knew was the correct call."
2021-09-24 16:24:09,"I was on a regular COVID update call today.  The hosts made it clear that this was a heavily White House driven decision, despite the science.    Say it ain't so, Joe.    

I guess Walensky wanted to avoid being seen as ineffectual as Mayorkas."
2021-09-24 16:25:38,"Great! Even if those at risk are healthy, give them the option of getting a booster. I would like to see further steps taken by the government to back up nurses, doctors, and other frontline employees. Give these people a ticker tape parade and a $1,000 tax bonus. I don't care—they deserve WAY more from their fellow citizens."
2021-09-24 16:27:07,"Walensky is in fact a scientist, so saying she's going against the science makes no sense. She's making an executive decision, which is why she's the chief."
2021-09-24 16:27:33,The only good mark here is that Biden is clearly trying to get booster shots to all Americans who want them. There is obvious constant political and professional in-fighting within these two health organizations and it makes neither the CDC or FDA look good.  Neither has looked good since the pandemic began.
2021-09-24 16:36:11,"I notice a commonality among the 'high risk' workers now recommended to take a third does of vaccine. They disproportionally work in buildings that are over 100 year old. Most of them have no ventilation system. There is a one-pipe steam heating system and that's it. Everything else is retro-fit. A/c is supplied by window units. Fresh air is obtained by opening a window. 

People who work in these facilities are in a super-spreader event every day. People who use these facilities attend a super-spreader event every time they enter. 

From a contagion standpoint it makes sense that they be next in line for a third shot, following those with comorbidities or are immunocomprimized. 

The unvaccinated aren't going to change their minds so they should be discounted for the purposes of this discussion."
2021-09-24 16:32:53,In Huntsville one just self certifies that you qualify.
2021-09-24 16:32:50,Dr. Walensky is what a leader looks like who can take charge and save American lives.  We finally have someone at the CDC who is taking charge.
2021-09-24 16:42:25,"Yes. Lets face it...these panel experts did not last year, or this recognize who was on the front lines and most exposed outside of medical personnel.  Retail workers got stiffed,  but were deemed ""essential workers"" out of the gate. But bodega workers were included. Which was fine, but what makes other public facing retail workers, in big or small store less at risk? Especially when you look at how much shopping the public was doing in the alleged lockdown. 

Lowes, Home Depot, and other home improvement outlets set sales records, saw day after day of long socially distanced lines out into their parking lots last year. And thousands of their employees got sick. And when the vaccine came out, they were trumped on the qualification metrics by bodega workers. What? 

Any public facing retail or service employees must be at the top of this booster list. 

We were told how important we are...but apparently these panel experts were not listening. Or more likely, dont care because they are clueless as to who is at risk of variant exposure."
2021-09-24 16:54:52,"In an ideal world we wouldn't be arguing over booster shots but continuing to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. But since there is a substantial subset of the population that flat out refuses to get vaccinated then you should let those that are willing to be vaccinated to get as much protection as they want. If certain members of our society can choose to not protect themselves for whatever reason then everyone else should be able to make the choice to get a booster if they feel it necessary.

I'm a healthcare worker who was one of the first vaccinated over 8 months ago. I also have a 13 month old at home who can't get vaccinated. A situation that seemed lost on the CDC panel. A high risk worker who takes care of an individual that simply can't get vaccinated. I, for one, will do whatever it takes to make sure my child is protected. I was getting ready to find my own vaccination site and lie about my vaccination status just to get the Pfizer booster if the CDC didn't approve it."
2021-09-24 16:56:08,"Perhaps they should have staggered this change in eligibility in one fashion or another. Such as 65 plus and immune compromised as of the 25th, frontline medical workers three weeks later, teachers and whoever, six weeks etc. It looks like that might have been what they were thinking but the public is never great at reading between the lines.

As it is now, lets see how crazy it becomes next week to arrange a booster shot if tens of millions suddenly want to join the booster queue. Hopefully it won't resemble initial confusion this past winter.

People were already pushing to the front of the line. I know an older couple who filled out the form at the pharmacy and checked off immune compromised. One was theoretically immune compromised (she believed) having had Lyme disease twenty years ago and persistent allergies. The other  lives with her and said, what the heck.

Perhaps the authorities are confident that there won't be a repeat of the confusion and chaos of this past winter. We've had almost 9 months of practice. Hopefully they've considered that possibility."
2021-09-24 16:58:41,"There’s a difference between medical necessity and public health policy. 

Are boosters for fully vaccinated health care workers medically necessary? Probably not. 

Do we need to prevent even mild infections in frontline healthcare workers to keep them out of quarantine so that they can go to work? Absolutely yes."
2021-09-24 16:59:30,"If there is some dispute among scientists about the necessity of the booster among generally healthier populations, when the consequences of the decision are either more protection agains death or less protection against death, erring on the side of the more conservative course of action is the better public policy."
2021-09-24 17:01:53,So much for instilling confidence in science when our head agencies can't agree with each other or internally.
2021-09-24 17:14:20,"Good. Keeping workers healthy should have been a top priority from the start and I am glad the head of the CDC is showing leadership here 

This policy will help protect our teachers and it is the right thing to do."
2021-09-24 17:20:28,"who to be included is fine but WHY are we being forced back into the hunger games where millions compete at once why are we incapable of having a national system and schedule.
We could say week one over 65 only., week 2, add front line workers, week 3 under 65 with underlying conditions only. Whatever! but something
If we miss our week then we enter the hunger games. 
Bet dictators have a system it might be a corrupt system but a system. 
Nobody in Washington seems to understand, accept or address  the trauma of the hunger games approach and leaving it to the states is no help, too late for that given they could not figure it out last time. 
I cannot believe we have the hunger games all over again, I am trying to support you Joe but sometimes you do not make it easy."

why shouldn't people be allowed to receive the Boosters ?

Really, three panels have to go over the same data and arrive at a conclusion independently??? Really? Sadly, this is typical of governmental approach to just about anything. We have overseers overseeing the overseers! I would suspect that in the near future, we will probably want to add another panel to this mixture approving drugs! 

Yes, yes, I know it is for safety of the public. Gee, we would not want a ""thalidomide"" drug to get out. But what would happen if we had a deadly outbreak virus, one that was a ""slate-wiper""?

But the evidence doesn't NOT support boosters for healthcare workers.  So, err on the side of caution, and make sure that healthcare workers who even have a ""mild"" case of COVID are still able to report to work.

2021-09-24 17:50:38,"This is much simpler than where they were headed. The reasons for complicating who can get what booster and when are trivial, costly and confusing. As usual CDC advisors did give enough weight to those factors."
2021-09-24 17:57:55,"I am concerned that Dr. Walensky might not be following the science in overruling the CDC panel that did not recommend Covid-19 booster shots for specific occupations.
I listened to much of the panel's debate about booster shots &, unless I am mistaken, the following factors figured into its recommendations:
1. Booster shots provide a clear-cut increase in immunity in certain groups of people: the elderly, those with certain underlying medical conditions, & nursing home residents because their immunity has been shown to diminish over time
2. Booster shots do not provide a clear-cut increase in immunity in people whose occupations (like teachers, health care providers, front line workers) put them in frequent contact with others because their immunity has not been shown to significantly diminish over time unless they are in one of the groups in 1., above who ARE eligible for boosters
*Because of 1., above, the panel recommended boosters for the elderly, people with certain medical conditions, & people in nursing homes because their risk of infection & severe disease will likely be decreased with the booster
*Because of 2., above, & the fact that the booster will not increase the immunity of vaccinated people outside the groups in 1., above, boosters given to people in specific occupations would NOT IMPROVE their ability to avoid Covid-19 or severe disease
*These people (and all of us) need to decrease our EXPOSURE risk: Vaccinate the unvaccinated. Wear a mask. Social distance."
2021-09-24 17:58:29,"I never understood the business about how vaccinated people are supposed to wear a mask everywhere to protect against mild cases, but getting another shot to avoid the need to wear the masks in the first place is not ok. Unless there's real safety concerns with 3rd shots, this feels inconsistent.

If the risk of a breakthrough is enough to justify masking, it should be enough to justify a booster shot."
2021-09-24 18:01:32,"As someone nearing 75 but with 5 unvaccinated grandchildren under 12, I am cheering efforts to protect both members of the medical profession and those put at risk by their jobs as clerks, and shopkeepers. With one political party determined to infect as many as possible, we need to allow those who ARE interested in both self-protection and protection of others the opportunity to do so. 

We had a scare earlier this week. Two of our grandchildren were riding in a car with a third child who later tested positive for coronavirus. Fortunately, our two have so far tested negative. Still, close calls and infections in schools will continue until vaccines are available for children. 

The CDC has focused exclusively on ""serious"" illness and death, ignoring long-term symptoms from COVID in their recommendations. So called ""long-COVID"" hits 10 to 30% of everyone who gets COVID, even if they have a mild case. ""Brian-fog"" is a very common long-term result of a COVID infection, as is extreme lethargy. It is hard to imagine a worst infliction for a child to have and still maintain their schooling. I have yet to see reports suggesting recovery from ""brain-fog"" unlike the recovery from loss of taste or smell. 

Blithely ignoring the ability to function effectively in a classroom for 10 to 30% of our school-age children in the decisions about the urgency of getting children protected (as they are for every other childhood disease) by a vaccine is a grave error."
2021-09-24 18:19:16,"I think the problem is that the jabs would do more good for people overseas who would take it but haven't had a chance but CDC and the Administration is charged with serving Americans.  Some have tried to make the case that new variants from overseas are a threat to us here, and that's true of course, but personally, I think not doing boosters increases the threat of new variants arising here and I don't think it's realistic that we can make any dent in the overseas threat by not doing boosters.  So I agree with the Administration and Dr. Walensky that we should do the boosters and do our best with charitable giving of jabs overseas."
2021-09-24 19:11:01,"CDC's advisory panel (ACIP) made the correct medical recommendation.  Then Dr. Walensky made the best policy decision.

The ACIP's role is to make recommendations based upon the medical evidence.  The medical experts did not agree but a majority voted against boosters for frontline workers because the U.S. based evidence was too weak to justify boosters.

Dr. Walensky's role is to take the medical advice and make a policy decision.  The FDA's advisory panel and the FDA executives recommended booster shots for frontline workers.  The ACIP vote was mixed, the U.S. data was merely insufficient to justify boosters, not contradictory to boosters. The ACIP opined that younger, frontline workers were still well protected from hospitalization and death.  

Dr. Walensky probably went beyond that thinking to consider that protection against infection has been waning (very significantly according to a study from Israel), the Pfizer booster brings protection against infection back up to the level of protection one month after the initial two doses (i.e., 95%+).  Dr. Walensky probably thought it important to protect frontline workers such as teachers, for example, so they do not infect students who would bring it home to family members who might become infected, be hospitalized or die.
She made the correct policy decision."
2021-09-24 19:14:41,"Regardless of whether this was the right decision or not, not following the advisory panel and using real data to inform the decision means the CDC has further undermined its credibility. Which in turn feeds the anti-vax propaganda machine. Which in turn leads to less people getting vaccinated. Which in turn means that the pandemic will rage on."
2021-09-24 19:19:45,"I'm a 62 year old high school teacher who shares the air in a windowless classroom with over 100 teenagers every day for 7 hours per day.  I've already had one COVID-positive student come to my class while symptomatic (he had lost all taste and smell). The next day he was sent home to quarantine, but I wasn't considered a ""close contact"" because I hadn't been within 6 feet of him for at least 15 minutes.  I'd actually been within 8 feet of him for 55 minutes!  

So on Wednesday afternoon when the FDA recommended that teachers and other frontline workers would be eligible to receive Pfizer booster shots, I trotted myself over to my neighborhood pharmacy and got one.  I'd had my last dose of Pfizer vaccine over six months prior, on March 11th.  

Then, on Thursday, the CDC panel inexplicably omitted front-line workers from their recommendation for booster eligibility.  I was so happy I'd gotten mine the day before!  

I'm stunned that the CDC seems to think that the human immune system remains youthfully robust right up until one's 65th birthday, when it inexplicably and instantly deteriorates to the point where one needs a booster shot to keep it going.  I posit that the immune system, just like every other organ system in the aging human body, starts a slow downward slide from about the age of 35 - and I'm much closer to bottoming out on that slope.  The difference between my immune system and that of a 65 year old is negligible.  I'm very glad Dr. Walensky realizes that."
2021-09-24 19:30:00,"The CDC really needs a crash course in communication. They need to be clear about the why. In the case of teachers and hospital workers I believe there are 2 why's that were not identified but are quite important. The fact is, most ""healthy"" individuals will be reasonably protected from serious illness and hospitalization with the 2 doses, however, there are cases where you want people to avoid contracting COVID all together. First, since teachers and hospital workers come in close contact with many people, they are not only at higher risk of catching covid, but of spreading it. Secondly, as case numbers soar in parts of the country, and hospital staff is stretched thin, how many people do you want calling out sick? Same for teachers, if you want kids in school, you need teachers to teach them. Which means they can't be home sick with covid. Not dying is great, but there are some people we need to keep healthy. Why the CDC can't just say that is beyond me."
2021-09-24 19:42:10,"I know the media thrives on conflict, but I have been on advisory panels at an academic medical university, and that is what we were--""advisory."" If the people receiving the panel's advice chose it accept it or reject our advice, they were the final arbiters of the decision, which they would need to defend. 

This was a far better report than I read in the Washington Post covering the same issue, because this article gave the reasons why the advisory panel did not believe there would be that much benefit by providing boosters for health care workers, teachers, etc. because of their younger age.

But I would not assume that just because someone is younger than 65 or even 50 that their immune systems are strong (especially with the junk food diet, lack of exercise, and stressful lifestyles so many Americans lead). 

Since so many U.S. jobs are in the service industries, then the people under 65 in these jobs are likely exposed to lots of people, who may or may not be vaccinated and may or may not wear masks. They need the protection--noting that wages are also often low in the service fields. So, they aren't worth a booster shot??

By erring on the side of caution and inclusiveness, Dr. Wilensky made the better decision--for the common good. But that she made such a decision is not rife with conflict drama."
2021-09-24 19:55:40,"""But some members of the committee said there was little evidence to suggest that vaccinated teachers, and even health care workers, were at risk of repeated exposure to the virus.""

Really? Those committee members must not have been following the news from Tennessee, Florida, Texas, among other places.

Dr. Walensky has made a perfectly reasonable decision. Booster shots are available, and the cost of administering them is minuscule. If just one out of 100 administered booster shots prevents a hospitalization that would have occurred without it, the measure has already paid off. And that is just the monetary side of it..."
2021-09-24 20:00:09,"I think that there are many ways to look at this change of position. I would suggest that the change comes from a difference of scope.  The charter of the Director of the CDC is, I am pretty certain, more general than the charter of the agency advisory panel.  It sounds like the panel made an at least defensible decision about the strictly medical aspects of the problem.  
However, their recommendation would have had two bad effects at the larger issue of the US society.  First, it would have been a real kick in the teeth to a key segment of the workforce, a segment that has been performing wonders for this country. Second, it would have encouraged massive lying and evasion for these people to get the protection that they needed.  If you set up a law, you need to be certain that you can enforce it."

2021-09-24 18:06:21,"Horay for Dr. Walenski! How could the panel exclude front line healthcare workers, grocery clerks that stock the shelves and other people whose work puts them at high rick of exposure to Covid? That is the most nonsensical boneheaded recommendation thus far. I am so GLAD Dr. Walenski overruled that stupid recommendation. Hip, hip, horay!"

It would have been a constant drumbeat of anger and fear directed at the Biden administration and the CDC.  And in the end they would have probably gotten boosters anyway, since there is no way at this time to really track who is getting boosters.  Walensky did the right thing and the political thing.

2021-09-24 18:37:53,"This pediatric hospitalist and his partners applaud Dr Walensky for overruling the ACIP and authorizing booster doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for physicians like myself and other health care professionals who are caring for patients with COVID-19, especially unvaccinated teenagers with COVID-19 pneumonia who are highly infectious. Several of my medical and dental hospital based colleagues have fallen ill with breakthrough COVID-19, as we were amongst the first to be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and there is clear evidence of waning immunity with time and decreased effectiveness of the vaccines against the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Although it is true that the risk of severe disease in fully vaccinated persons, including those in high risk professions, is still low, we need to protect these essential employees, especially overworked front line physicians, nurses, and others who are saving lives of seriously and critically ill hospitalized patients in the face of a severe nursing shortage when one or two sick staff members can be highly disruptive and compromise patient care. The data has clearly shown that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections can easily transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, so providing them with additional protection will also decrease of the spread of the virus to others who cannot be protected, such as children 0-11 yo, those with compromised immune systems, and the elderly, especially those in our households."
2021-09-24 18:39:29,"So once again:  I’m 72, got the Moderna, can I get a Pfizer booster?  I have to fly to Florida next month, and would feel safer with a booster.  What difference does it make which one you got?  Moderna doesn’t even have an approved booster yet, when they do, it apparently will be a half dose. I have not yet seen one article where they’re making this clear, has anyone?  Sure, it would be great if everyone got the initial vaccine, but don’t penalize the rest of us who are doing everything we can not to get Covid!  It appears we have plenty of the vaccine, it’s even being thrown away.  I’m going to try to get a booster, will see what happens."
2021-09-24 19:10:04,"Mandatory boosters coming, all causing the virus to mutate even further in the vaccinated to evade the vaccines, as has already happened. We’re fighting Delta with a vaccine for Alpha. Blaming the unvaxxed for mutations might feel good to the pitchfork-carrying mobs but it’s anti-science and goes against basic evolutionary biology."
2021-09-24 17:56:49,It would be refreshing to read an article that talks about Covid and vaccines and the CDC and public health policies and entities without automatically relating it to whether it boosts Republicans or Democrats.

2021-09-24 18:17:09,"I am a sommelier and restaurant manager (laid off due to Covid) with 20  years in the industry. It is infuriating to me that restaurant workers, who have to interact with maskless people day in & day out, are continually left out of this grouping of people with “occupational risk”. Just another slap in the face to this devalued and degraded yet huge part of the American work force. It is truly no wonder that there has been such a dearth of restaurant workers during this recovery. The media and general population have seemed so surprised that restaurant workers have been unwilling to put their lives at risk to slang burgers to entitled people for low pay. I have to say, this is very much NOT shocking to industry insiders. The reality is that the restaurant business model and culture have been long overdue for a reckoning and reworking but the main obstacle is that consumers are so ignorant of what actually goes into operational costs for a restaurant and what it would take to offer workers more security and livable wages while still making any profit. I feel like restaurant economics should be a mandatory class in every high school. Maybe then people would be willing to pay what are realistic and fair prices."

2021-09-24 18:03:58,"Nurses, docs, hospital janitors, teachers, bus drivers, anyone who has direct contact or close contact should get a booster. Nurses are some of the workers that have the most direct contact once that pt is intubated."

2021-09-24 19:01:23,"Boosters are not just to decrease risk of former endpoints of moderate or severe disease or hospitalization, but to decrease the risk of mild or asymptomatic infection, transmissibility, proliferation of variants, and ""Long Covid""."
2021-09-24 20:03:56,"Time to focus on getting our children and grandchildren vaccinated. With urgency. 

Time also to get booster shots for all three of the vaccines. (and it is not at all clear why extensive tests are needed) The J&J vaccine appears to be less effective than either of the two mRNA vaccines, but still highly effective. Still, its efficiency declines with time, and testing so far shows that a second shot provides mRNA level resistance.

Time to increase production (globally) and get the supply chains going so the world can be vaccinated -- as was done for smallpox. 

But most of all, time to start really penalizing those who chose to stay unvaccinated. For one thing, their health insurance must be changed to bear full cost of the infections they statistically cause, along with their own treatments. Also, because their wounds are self-induced, they must not be admitted to any hospital that is nearing ICU capacity with any COVID related ailment, because doing so endangers those who might need that service and who do not suffer self-induced damage. There is no reason to coddle those who deliberately put others at risk. Let them pay the full price for the damage they do others."
2021-09-24 20:09:15,This is unfortunately going to exacerbate the work shortage in these industries if this turns into a mandate.  There are many who were good and ready to get a vaccine for the good of the country and the world but many of those people- especially young people- are going to be rightly hesitant to get a booster.
2021-09-24 20:09:49,"Good. Ms. Walensky was tougher than Messrs. No, and people who have to work near other people can protect themselves from people who are ignoring America’s great call for Immunity. The vaccine has gone up and down like Chrysler before Lee Iacocca. It went up the ramp and hit a bear market. Then it looked like it was about to rally, and now it’s slumping again. It seems we should have enough to give boosters and make deliveries to nations without local supply, as both steps are needed."
2021-09-24 20:20:45,"Breakthrough infections in vaccinated teachers are already happening, healthcare workers, too. This puts the individual and their families at risk. Waiting until these infections number in the hundreds of thousands before allowing boosters would have been a terrible decision. 
Big thanks to Dr. Walensky for doing the right thing."
2021-09-24 20:28:50,"If I must get a booster, will I still have to wear a mask? If the booster  dramatically increases protection against transmission and infection, then someone-using scientific facts please- tell me why I would still have to wear a mask. If I pose no threat to myself or anyone else, then the only reason I can figure out is optics, to set an example, or to make unvaccinated people feel better. I am done with all that. If I get the third shot I will have done anything and everything necessary for my own safety and that of others. On the other hand, if the third shot is still not enough to drastically increase protection and reduce risk, then why am I getting it?
At some point, you can't have it both ways. 
Regardless, I expect that some people are so tightly committed to masking, that, for no logical reason, they will deem me selfish and irresponsible.
And if the reason is that, somehow, maybe, no matter how remote or unlikely, I might still transmit a virus, then I guess we are just masked up for life.
If someone has a contrary opinion, please base it on objective facts that you have verified, not just heard from a third source- and definitely not from any of the three cable ""news"" stations."
2021-09-24 21:03:43,"Given that we know the vaccine is perfectly safe, we have all been part of a mass experiment over the course of the spring and summer, why not make booster shots available for all adults who want them. Why ration them for the over 65s who generally don’t work?"
2021-09-24 21:05:51,Having infections in previously vaccinated people is a prescription for having the virus develop resistance to that vaccine because individual virus with some resistance will out compete the less resistant.  So we need to boost to minimize the decline in vaccine effectiveness.  We won't be doing people overseas any favors if we generate a resistant variant here.
2021-09-24 21:16:00,"Thank Goodness for Dr. Walensky’s decision injecting a modicum of sanity into this process.  Still, it is too little too late.  The CDC and FDA are broken.  A functioning health agency would already be working on boosters for the variants we already know about like Gamma, Mu, etc. and have them in the pipeline rather than still debating whether yesterday’s version of the vaccine still works against a variant that has already ravaged the country.  Only from such incompetent agencies could there be any confusion over what is already known - unless you want to force Americans to suffer needless disease and downtime, risk of long COVID, and expose their unvaccinated children because of breakthrough infections, then most if not all Americans should be getting boosters now.  Well, actually, it should have been done months ago. And there is zero data suggesting any real health downside/risk beyond pure speculation. Other countries have already ACTED to protect their citizens with boosters.  The CDC and FDA have repeatedly gotten it wrong and been behind the curve. They are not learning from their past mistakes. Biden should  take matters in hand.  It should be made clear that the goal is to prevent DISEASE, prevent INFECTION, prevent transmission, not merely keep people from dying or going to the hospital. How dare the CDC presume to condemn us to suffer needless illness though preventable breakthrough infections with a still unknown disease when a safe, effective solution exists."
2021-09-24 21:21:12,"People are arguing about the wrong thing when it comes to boosters.

The science does say boosters work.

Ethics might say we should send the shots to the less fortunate because boosters will only save a few lives here and prevent sickness that is non-lethal.  

Epidemiology might say protecting more people abroad will keep the disease from spreading as much and might in the end save lives here as well.

Science can accurately say many things, but public policy is not simply about science.  Science lends useful information, but then people need to decide what the ""best"" thing to do is."
2021-09-24 21:40:55,"Dr. Walensky made the right decision. As long as there are kids who are too young to be vaccinated, teachers need to be safe.  There is too much covid going around in elementary and high schools. We need our kids in schoo and our teachers teaching. Teachers need to be vaccinated. I am glad she overruled the CDC advisory committee."
2021-09-24 21:52:46,"The CDC and FDA are conditioned to a more deliberative pace, making decisions based on plenty of data, and perfectly happy to wait for as much data as is needed to avoid making a costly mistake.  The problem is that in a pandemic response, the cost of delay also becomes enormous, with the result that the country would be better served by a body able to make strategic best judgments with very limited data. Obviously you want them to be cautious, but what we are experiencing now seems to be advisory groups utterly oblivious of the risk of doing nothing. It seems clear to me that some different group of advisors should be in place to make strategic decisions in the event of pandemic.  

Early vaccinations and boosters for ""frontline"" workers seems like one of those issues that does not get proper weight in the current advisory groups: at least among those with jobs interfacing with the public (retail workers, for example), one worker is a common contact for enormous numbers of people, not only putting them at elevated risk for getting sick, but also making the likely source for large numbers of infections once they themselves are infected.  IMHO they should have been expedited to the front of the line with the original rollout as well as for boosters.  Prophylaxis among frontline workers, hardening them against becoming sources of infection, just seems like smart pandemic thinking."
2021-09-24 21:12:54,"Good for Dr. Walensky! Every time a doctor, nurse, or other health care provider tests positive, they are required to isolate for 10 days. That's 10 days when the clinic or hospital has to manage without their services. Even if that person is 30 years old and symptom-free, it's a blow to the workplace struggling to save the lives of seriously ill COVID patients. Everything we can do to reduce their risk of infection is a boon to the patients as well as the rest of the overworked staff."
2021-09-24 20:36:13,"The CDC approving boosters for workers-at-risk demonstrates a willingness to care about those workers.

I hope it's an, albeit small, indication of a changing attitude in our country and sends a message of: We see you, and we value your contribution to our economy and society at large.

Or is it actually a reveal of: Oh, crimminy!  We'd better keep these folks working or our economy will collapse, and what will make the most impact for the least amount of effort and money?

Because a booster program targeting at-risk workers is not a trivial thing but a project that will require investments of time and money, and because it is a right-minded propping up of the essential struts of our society, I hope this move is somewhere in between honest service to the greater good, and cynical capitalism."
2021-09-24 20:17:01,"There seems to be some confusion about which immune systems require assistance in the form of a booster.  In Israel only the elderly with other serious risk factors are being hospitalized with breakthrough infections after vaccination.  Most breakthroughs are not serious.

And they haven't suddenly gotten more serious now just because there's a booster available."
2021-09-24 20:17:17,Good for her! She acted in the best interests of the USA and its citizens. The people she serves!
2021-09-24 13:21:56,"Are people treating breakthrough cases as if they are the same as cases in March 2020 when no one was vaccinated?  As if they are automatically deadly?  In fact, they are only dangerous to those with other risk factors, mostly particularly age.  

A lot of the early beliefs about vaccines are still held today -- ex., that a vaccine stops contagion -- despite the fact that contagion has changed dramatically due to Delta.

The booster should be for those who cannot get sick because of other risk factors, not for those who don't want to get sick."
2021-09-24 22:18:24,"As a person trained in detection theory, I’m dismayed by the poor critical thinking by the so-called ‘scientists’ at the CDC.  Makes me glad my primary GP was trained as an engineer first, rather than some soft science discipline."
2021-09-24 22:25:57,"Well, I'm grateful that as a teacher I qualify for a booster shot; currently my last shot can't be more than 277 days in the past to be permitted to enter Europe, and I plan to go next June.  

I know that a lot of people will complain that Americans will be eligible for a third shot while millions in other countries are waiting for their first; but as long as we DO have easy access to the vaccines, I'm going to go right ahead and get my third."
2021-09-24 22:34:11,"Thank you Dr. Walensky! Although I have no doubt that the panel who made the original recommendation are highly intelligent medical professionals, the majority are pediatric specialists. I believe a more varied panel should have been consulted. I serve patients their food across 11 floors, and many different units in a large hospital. I am in close direct contact with each patient. Although not on every unit every day, I often bring up ""late"" trays, to several different floors, one after another. Imagine if, as my immunity wanes, I contract asymptomatic Covid. I could conceivably infect entire wings of already ill and injured patients. Anything to help that Not happen, Should happen! 💉💉_💉 My 2nd Pfizer shot was in mid April, so I'm coming up on six months in a few weeks. Did the panel not conceive of front line workers like me and my colleagues?"
2021-09-24 22:20:22,"An immoral decision based upon politics, not science

Unlike the priorities dictated by the CDC when vaccination began, this decision was NOT setting priority to receive vaccination booster shots

This decision was DENIAL of vaccine to certain younger persons based solely on whether or not they worked for favored types of organizations

I favor everyone getting booster shots.  But the CDC advisory panel recommended only persons over 65 or younger persons vulnerable due to complicating medical conditions.  Their stated criterion for boosters was to protect against hospitalization and death, not to protect against all infections.  

But the political boss at CDC overruled and dictated that younger people employed by schools, medical organizations and grocery stores get access to boosters to protect them from mild or asymptomatic infections.  She DENIED boosters to all other younger people, intentionally leaving them exposed to infections while protecting the younger people she discriminated in favor of

Furthermore, the CDC political boss declared she also wanted to give protection from disease to persons who were the minorities that she favored.  She explained that her favored minority populations were disproportionately represented in the favored groups and she wanted to give privileged protection to their health while denying that protection to persons not her favored group

Walensky is unfit to head the CDC or any position of responsibility in government"
2021-09-24 22:17:47,"CDC, yet again archaic and preposterously slow. Brilliant scientists but on a different planet regarding practicality. Thankfully the chief has common sense. Kudos to her!"
2021-09-24 20:52:18,I would very much like to know who the ACIP members are and how many are appointees through Trumps HHS department. It might help us realize why the CDC cannot rely on its advisory committee for sane advice.
2021-09-24 20:56:35,"Well then, it appears that the CDC Director has decided that politics  - namely, approval from her boss Joe Biden - trump's science (again). This is just the latest example that much of the rhetoric about ""follow the science"" is really a politician finding a ""scientist"" that agrees with him or her, then stoking the partisan flames via friendly media to put the stamp of approval on a their new ""policy.""

Just ask noted science followers Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsome, Lori Lightfoot, London Breed and a roster of others on the crank keft that have been caught red handed not following their own pandemic lockdown rules while insisting that lesser beings do so.

This is more like ""follow the sceance"" as it is definitely not science."
2021-09-24 20:57:20,"This was a big duh. If front line workers were first in line for the initial rollout, why wouldn’t they be so for the booster?"
2021-09-24 20:46:14,"Nice try, but...

You talk like non-union frontline workers not even in the room...

Same way Obama and his proxy used to talk about non-union GM workers – as they saved the company for future explosive EV market growth…

Sooo – these folks should have the option to jump the line…

Or not even have to stand in it in the first place, if they don’t see fit…

PS

Perhaps you should consider giving retail workers 3/5 of a dose…"
2021-09-24 21:39:01,Rite Aid got the CDC memo.  Walked in and asked. Got my 3rd dose of Pfizer.
2021-09-24 22:20:06,"Because politics, not science."
2021-09-24 23:41:41,"The CDC is so confusing, contradictory and slow in the end people are left to decide for themselves on the basis of no solid information. It's no wonder so many look to vitamin salesmen, politicians and religious websites which have a clear agenda and clear messaging- even if they're completely ignorant and self concerned. The CDC has lost most of its credibility already over their N95/KN95 misinformation/disinformation campaign, the political decisions whether/not to call it ""airborne"" or ""transmitted by the asymptomatic"", persisting in their obsessive hand washing, ""testing testing testing"", contact tracing, quarantining- even when everyone-including them- knows it's ineffective... there's not much more left to lose over the vaccines and the boosters. They should admit what they did, clean house, get all new people from Stanford, Johns Hopkins, UW-people who know what they're doing, people who know how to design and interpret research, get rid of the political patronage and make enough N95 masks so even the anti-vaxxers can protect themselves. I'm fed up with the politicization of science, especially when it's epidemiology during a pandemic. That didn't change with regime-change, either. We have an epidemic of ignorance and corruption- and a half-million needless American deaths and millions of lifetime disabilities as the result."
2021-09-25 00:19:25,"Thank you, Dr. Walensky. The idea of limiting booster shots to the old and those at high risk for Covid but not for frontline workers is at complete odds with common sense.  Frontline workers ARE at high risk for Covid by the very nature of what they do. They must interact with people who are unvaccinated; children and adults  who might be carriers of the disease, people who have raging cases of the disease, and with everyone in between, by the very nature of they do. We need these people to keep our entire country functioning, and above all, they deserve to be protected. The sacrifices they make are our lifeline to the future."
2021-09-25 02:21:46,"I am in full agreement with Dr. Walensky. There are front line workers everywhere. Those working at the grocery stores, salons, restaurants, schools, universities, healthcare clinics and in almost most locations where there is business activity. As work places prepare to re-open, it is prudent to provide the vaccine/booster to as many people as possible. The overall objective is to get all those in the acceptable age group to be vaccinated."
2021-09-25 00:37:22,what we need is vaccine mandates and share the vaccines with African and Caribbean countries!
2021-09-25 03:40:44,"Bureaucrats at the CDC and others seem to have missed the class on decision theory. We have a vaccine with essentially no known bad effects, breakthrough infections on the rise, and lots of vaccine available. When you multiply the effects of doing boosters by the costs and compare against the costs and effects of not, it is clear that you have everybody who has had two Pfizer shots more than six months ago get a third shot. Dr. Walensky needs to push further."
2021-09-24 03:31:36,"Great. Well, it will be easy to conclude that if three doses is not safe, two can't be that good. What a mess."
2021-09-24 03:40:15,"I’m certainly no anti vaxxer but the mixed and confusing messaging is not helping. FDA says one thing, and CDC says something else the next day. Get on the same page folks…the confusion and contradictions are not helping."
2021-09-24 03:41:37,"As a healthcare worker 8.5 months out from my second dose, I'm feeling outraged.  I was in the very first week of vaccinations and now I feel like they're hanging us early adopters out to dry.  It's outrageous and wrong."
2021-09-24 03:51:22,"I no longer rely on the CDC to make health decisions for me or my family.  I now base my decisions on my own research based on actual studies done by competent groups of researchers.  The government has let us all down, what a mess."
2021-09-24 04:00:10,"I'm an ER doctor.  I will follow recommendations as always.  That said, it is disappointing that the CDC does not assign any apparent weight to the intensity and frequency of exposure we face."
2021-09-24 04:02:59,"Everybody take a deep breathe and relax. The simple fact is all three vaccines work well at preventing hospitalization and death, even without boosters. That's why there is so much debate as to whether boosters are necessary - because they don't add much. And yes, I'm a health care worker who got my second shot Jan. 5. If the CDC ends up recommending a booster for me I will take it. Otherwise I am not too worried."
2021-09-24 04:08:11,"In line with one of the quotes in this article, I think that there's too much focus on boosters and not enough on measures that let vaccinated people get on with their lives, while feeling secure, and put pressure on stragglers to get vaccinated.

Several major European countries have implemented vaccination passes. Canadian provinces covering 95% of the country's population have also done so. The Canadian passes are required for non-essential activities like going to restaurants, gyms, cinemas and sports events. The passes protect vaccinated people and prevent unvaccinated people from infecting one-another.

The European experience, and early Canadian data, says that they will result in a significant increase in the number of 18-39 year olds, who are socially active and lagging on vaccination, who get onboard with vaccination.

So far, only New York City and San Francisco have adopted passes here. In New York State, the Excelsior Pass, which we have had since March, could have been used the same way as the European and Canadian passes. Instead, Bill de Blasio has sidelined the Excelsior Pass, and introduced a watered-down version, requiring proof that can easily be fabricated, called the Key to NY City Pass.

We are so obsessed with boosters that we are ignoring obvious ways to reduce infections and get vaccination up."
2021-09-24 04:16:09,"Thankfully nobody is keeping track of anything anywhere.  There is no central database, no vaccine passports.  Go get a booster shot.  Tell them it's your first shot.  How would they know otherwise?"
2021-09-24 04:23:53,"1. Establish a vaccination pass. Proof of no infection will not be a substitute unless the person has been excused by his doctor from receiving a vaccine for legitimate medical reasons (a tiny percentage of all people).

2. Make the vaccination pass mandatory for all federal workers (including all military), all forms of interstate travel, and all companies that do business with or receive any funds from the US government. Make all states impose the same obligation for all those within state lines, failing which they will forfeit all federal benefits (the Biden Administration has adopted very weak versions of these measures).

3.  Offer booster shots to all Americans age 30 and older and all those who otherwise have risk factors.

4.  Fund a further 2 billion doses for the rest of the world and require pharmaceuticals doing business with the US to license their vaccines to major generic manufacturers worldwide that can make them safely.

5. Thank the heads of the CDC and the FDA for their service and replace them with leaders who can act decisively and provide clarity to a confused public, as their counterparts have done in various other countries."
2021-09-24 04:27:31,"Even with boosters everyone needs to be careful.   It seems the CDC is waiting for numbers of infections to point the way.  I do think that is the wrong approach and boosters should be based on time since second shot, or in the case of J&J, as soon as possible.  I understand the need for caution and not wanting to put one’s body into a vaccine exhaustion mode if a variant that isn’t responsive to current vaccines suddenly pops up.  With the number of unvaccinated in the US, anything is possible.  I also think the longer time frame between shots allows more vaccines to be shared around the world quickly.  At some point the US will have the highest percentage of unvaccinated and the rest of the world will be safe.  I hope that happens quickly."
2021-09-24 04:36:08,"If you haven’t realized that our social fabric has been shredded and all of our most established and critical institutions are hanging by a thread, you haven’t been paying attention. 

Folks, we are on our own and must fend for ourselves. Many of our friends and neighbors refuse all reason and decency and daily endanger us all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed. Many of our so called leaders actively campaign against public health and safety. Misinformation is everywhere. Our experts are more mired in pettiness, political calculations, and punditry than they are dedicated to protecting people’s lives. Our doctors and public health officials feel fine with us all contracting a novel virus that attacks various vital organs and has serious long-term effects because at least most of us won’t be dead. And the people riding out the chaos still trying to do the right thing are being denied access to a medical intervention that is readily available, has already been purchased, and could prevent significant illness and possible disability. And we’re being told the solution to our dysfunction is to try harder to get the antivaxxers vaxed, to think more about Africa, and to stop being so selfish. Gaslighting at its finest.

I’ve done what I’ve had to do to protect myself because I live in a society where protecting others isn’t done. I got my shot in August. I lied. I recommend it. Either that or roll the dice daily as efficacy drops and experts wait for data they aren’t collecting."
2021-09-24 04:39:44,I got my third Pfizer jab in August at a Vons grocery pharmacy
2021-09-24 04:40:15,"Israel’s agency says boost everyone; the Brits and French say boost many more than FDA says. And this comes down to goals - the FDA’s are modest, to avoid hospitalization; peer agencies have a much lower bar. The informed should follow go the agency whose data driven goals align with their own. It’s a free world."
2021-09-24 04:47:22,We’ll keep on following the developments because they’re so important. But I would like to see undeveloped countries be able to vaccinate more people. We’re high risk group but we know how to protect ourselves and our families. And they know how to protect us punto.
2021-09-24 04:59:07,"As a 76 year old man with pre-diabetes and and an auto-immune condition requiring some heavy duty medication, I would gladly give up my booster dose and stay at home to see life saving medical workers have at least a small safety net while trying to save the lives of anti-vaccers who ask them to sacrifice their lives for for their delusional paranoia.  

With millions of people foregoing the vaccine, there should be plenty of doses for people risking their lives for the 95% of cases coming to hospitals because they refuse the vaccine."
2021-09-24 05:45:41,"It's time to wipe out Covid once and for all.  Booster shoots for any vaccine, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson are a good idea and make good old fashioned common sense.   There should never have been a debate about this in the first place. The US has a surplus of vaccine, and many individuals are still unwilling to get their first dose. 

If we ever have a chance of developing herd immunity booster shots are the answer  I got a Moderna (the name comes from ""modern Rna"") shot back in April by pure dumb luck, but I intend to get a booster as soon as it's available.  

The CDC is hesitating because they don't want to take vaccine from many parts of the rest of the world because they have never got their first or second vaccinations. 

The US needs to do what it should do to protect our nation.  We need to make the US virtually ""bulletproof"" against Covid and prevent it from mutating.  The only way to do that is to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate.  Get as many people as possible to get their first and second shots Then give those who have had their first round of injections a booster as soon as possible."
2021-09-24 05:48:33,"Hmm… back in March, everyone was clamoring for a Pfizer shot because, well, it’s Pfizer. I had little choice but to get Moderna. Who knew tables would turn so fast in a couple of months"
2021-09-24 06:01:11,"“But some members of the committee [ the C.D.C. panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ] said there was little evidence to suggest that vaccinated teachers, and even health care workers, were at risk of repeated exposure to the virus.”

Really?  This conflicts with the reality we are all living with:  schools dealing with repeated quarantines and hospitals in crisis mode with Covid patients."
2021-09-24 09:29:40,"This is the proverbial ""too many cooks spoil a meal!""

Ultimately, offering a booster to the healthcare or even frontline workers without making it mandatory should satisfy everyone except those with a supersized ego or some other agendas.

To be honest, pitting the FDA against the CDC is the invention of the mass media who are eager to find a story angle. These folks have the own agenda. And don't get me started with the likes of Fox and Newsmax"
2021-09-24 10:37:26,"Am surprised that the CDC thinks that nearly anyone who has not gotten vaccinated by now will get vaccinated in the future without a nationwide mandate and a vaccination passport. I know too many people who out of ignorance refuse to be vaccinated. As recently reported in the NYT even people who have had Covid and received monoclonal antibodies are still refusing a vaccine. 

Take care of the vulnerable, aged and front line workers like teachers and medical workers now - on a voluntary basis. When the obvious presents itself to the bickering agencies they can revisit the subject."
2021-09-24 11:40:00,"A good friend of mine and his wife in Seattle, who are both  over 70 years old, already got their booster shots couple weeks ago. They are active and going to places that they don't want to take any unnecessary risks. I want to do the same.  Right now I am trapped at home and go nowhere except grocery stores.  This is depressing.

I want my shot ASAP."
2021-09-24 12:07:08,"The guidance and the media coverage of the guidance has been poorly communicated. manipulative, incomplete, and straight out dishonest from the start.

Masks not necessary, then necessary, then a life or death decision. Reasoning: masks will help but if everyone buys one there will not be enough for health care workers and first responders. Effectiveness? Depends, on type, fit, environment, and uniformity of use. Mostly has been a badge of inclusiveness with functionality secondary.

Vaccine is totally safe and effective. No risk, compete protection. Some risk high protection. Maybe riskier for some and protection falls off over time. Maybe protection falls off pretty rapidly and there is more risk.
Sure there is uncertainty and the best response is being worked out in real time. But that has not been how the process has been communicated. One declaration has been replaced with another conflicting one, and then another.
The uncertainty, the fact the vaccine has a small risk, less than the risk the virus posses, but still some, should have been more clearly communicated. Then it would be obvious to everyone now why there is a risk from a third dose of the vaccine to be weighed against the risk of the virus. Why for children and young people the small risk from the vaccine may not be worth it to reduce the equally small risk of serious illness from the virus."
2021-09-24 12:23:45,"It really is difficult to figure all this out.  I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine which I understand maintains its efficacy at 8 months.  And it is based on the same technology as the Ebola vaccine which has been shown in some studies to maintain efficacy for three years.  
And the pandemic won't wane for about another 18 months I believe if we look historically at pandemics.  
So in the meanwhile- vaccinate the world."
2021-09-24 12:29:33,"Why are we saving so many doses for people that don’t want them?  You can just walk into pretty much any grocery store or pharmacy and get a jab without an appointment around here.  The demand for first/second doses has dried up, and will continue unless there are mandates or vaccine passes required for travel and sporting events.   So why not let teachers, doctors and health care workers, bus drivers, flight attendants, and others who regularly face exposure risks get a third?"
2021-09-24 13:23:59,"This ridiculous hand wringing over a booster shot continues. Why?  Why are people being told by narrow minded ""experts"" that they don't need one?  What's the harm? Even if the motive of Big Pharma is more profit, who cares?  From my viewpoint, they should be rewarded for coming up with a life-saving vaccine in record time.  I got my booster last week at my local Walgreens and was happy to get it.

And don't get me started on anti-vaxxers.  If a vaccine had been available at the time of the Spanish flu in 1918, everyone would have received a dose, happily.  Same with smallpox, measles, mumps and of course  polio in the 1950's.  We didn't have this ""medical freedom"" utter nonsense when polio was ravaging children in the 1950's. How did we come to a place where people treat vaccination as a civil rights issue?  It is a public health emergency that trumps everything for the common good.  One selfish person cannot threaten the health of many. Mandatory vaccination for everyone, whether they like it or not."
2021-09-24 14:11:32,"CDC vs. FDA. I hope this isn’t like Spy vs. Spy, the Tony Prohias cartoon of the 1960s where the white spy and the black spy took turns blowing each other up in a devious game of stalemate. If the folks at my clinic don’t need a booster right now, that’s fine. If the 64-year olds don’t need it, fine. Getting the booster does mean risking an extra public exposure; that’s how the Covid era is, every trip to the corner store being evaluated for necessity. But the FDA says health workers should have a booster. And Public Health England says you should have it if you’re over 50. Those 15 years between 50 and 65 are long, much longer than the gap between 35 and 50 because the aging process accelerates as you go along.

J&J and Moderna are scratching their heads of course. Once convinced it’s time, I guess we’ll get our boosters the way Spy does, by sneaking into a pharmacy under pretense. And then they’ll be talking about putting a guard there."
2021-09-24 05:39:58,"The CDC and FDA are broken.  Only from such incompetent agencies could there be any confusion over what is already factually known - unless you want to force Americans to suffer needless disease and downtime, risk of long COVID, and expose their unvaccinated children because of breakthrough infections, then most if not all Americans  should be getting boosters now.  Well, actually, it should have been done months ago.  And there is zero data suggesting any real health downside/risk beyond pure speculation. That's why the UK, France, Germany, Israel, and other countries have already ACTED to protect their citizens and started giving boosters.  Starting with its failed approach to testing and continuing through slow roll out of vaccinates for children and now boosters, the CDC and FDA have repeatedly gotten it wrong and been behind the curve.  And they are not learning from their past mistakes, rather their decision on boosters today is more of the same.  Biden snd Congress need to demand the resignation of the heads of both the CDC and FDA and take matters in hand.  It should also be made clear that the goal is to prevent DISEASE, prevent INFECTION, prevent transmission, not merely keep people from dying or going to the hospital. How dare the CDC presume to condemn us to suffer needless illness though preventable breakthrough infections with a still unknown disease when a safe, effective solution exists.

2021-09-24 04:45:40,"Once again, CDC dropped the ball by not authorizing boosters for health workers and teachers. I have completely lost confidence in CDC under Walensky’s leadership. First, the masking recommendation. Now this. Enough! Fire her already!"
2021-09-24 04:57:11,I’m confused.
2021-09-24 06:19:23,Can the CDC even muster up the courage and decency to provide a clear explanation as to why boosters to US citizens are being painstakingly rationed to begin with? Are the rations in place because of a safety concern of booster vaccine side effects OR because vaccines should be shipped to poor countries that need the vaccine more then the US needs boosters OR are they concerned that a mass booster campaign in the US would tax our health care system?  A combination?  Pathetic that we (US citizens) are left guessing.

Long overdue!"

How can folks have the kind of clarity and certainty that is required if you are going to mandate shots for employment and entertainment if those in charge are neither clear nor consistent in any aspect of the drug.  The agencies, the scientists and a President who wishes to inject himself into the debate must speak with a clear, concise and singular voice and direction.  Otherwise confusion and anti-vaxers will reign."
2021-09-22 23:53:33,We will now enter another period of waiting while shots expire and are discarded.  Ceaseless parsing out groups for vaccination is pointless and counterproductive.  If it is ok for people at high risk of occupational exposure a booster is good for all.
2021-09-23 00:02:53,"I think it would be simpler if they offered a booster to anyone who wanted one. Probably young, very healthy people would not want a booster. Why would they? A lot of young people don't even wear masks in public. Many people who are old or vulnerable (and would thus be eligible for a booster) are declining to get even *first* dose because of fears about the vaccines.

So the FDA is making things unnecessarily complicated. If they make the vaccine available to those who want it, the people who will take up the offer will be people who are old or vulnerable to Covid."

2021-09-23 00:15:41,"Pfizer Covid immunizations seem to need a booster.  Recent college cases show super-spreading among a community of fully Pfizer-vaccinated young adults.  

I hope they make this available to people with asthma, autoimmune illnesses, any of the second string conditions that could create serious illness.   Obviously the first doses should go to more severe cases such as people who are immunocompromised or have cancer, or just elderly folks whose immune responses are reduced overall.   If there is no shortage of US vaccines, I would love to see these doses more widely available to people who need or want them.   

The breakthrough cases definitely seem to be more prevalent in people with Pfizer shots, and I think (based on anecdotal evidence) they are underreported in the data."
2021-09-23 00:27:50,"From a practical standpoint, rather than trying to micromanage exactly which medical conditions and jobs are/are not eligible for boosters, just offer it to everyone after 6 months, but with the recommendation that only people at risk of severe COVID 19 take it. Then, let people use their judgements.

It's effectively like that anyway, since anyone can go in, pretending that their 3rd dose is their first. I would not at all be surprised if half the first doses issued the past week are actually 3rd doses."
2021-09-23 00:30:21,"My first two shots through LA County Health in the +65 category were easy once I made the first appointment online, they even sent me the second follow up appointment in two weeks automatically.  It would be great if the third booster was automatically roboscheduled."

2021-09-23 00:19:49,"I'm very disappointed with this decision. As someone who doesn't fall into either category but who got my second Pfizer shot in April, I feel vulnerable because of its waning protectiveness.

Also, with all the studies coming out, including one today that talked about the brain damage this virus can cause, even if you have a mild case (which accounts for the brain fog some people get). So getting a mild case isn't necessarily just a 'mild cold."" It can be potentially devasting.  And according to the studies in Israel, Pfizer only has 39% effectiveness after 6 months. Where does that leave people like me?

They should give a booster to anyone who wants one."

An incredibly safe vaccine booster, likely to dramatically reduce symptomatic disease even if not subjected to the ideal clinical trial.

FDA's response: ""We enjoy watching people die while we wait for perfect data.  We giggle at the many survivors of symptomatic disease who have permanent scarring in their lungs.  Who's bringing Krispy Kreme to the next meeting?"""
2021-09-23 00:24:35,"The  granular Israeli studies were definitive in proving vaccination protection wanes and that boosters mitigate this for at least 3 months. In our country, in April the CDC made a conscious decision not to track  non-hospitalized breakthrough cases. They were caught out in July by independent investigators after massive breakthrough in Provincetown with some significant morbidity.
Currently, in the US thousands of doses are thrown out every day while serious breakthrough cases- mostly in compromised but also is some younger have been underreported by the Government and media.
The refusal of the FDA to approve boosters for all who want them- and mRNA boosters for those who received the less effective Johnson & Johnson- is somewhat related to a false “equity” argument that Boosters take away from the effort to inoculate the unvaccinated and provide vaccine to low and middle income countries."

Your imagary is negative, couterproductive and harmful."
2021-09-23 00:35:35,These folks could not be good used car salesman. Just open the boosters up to everybody and take it from there. Next week they will be debating should they give it to people whose dominant hand is their left hand. No Mask-Mask - Vaccine No Mask - Vaccine and Mask. people need a score card to keep up with this circus. If the formulation of the booster was different from the first two shots people would understand all the twist and turns. BUT! Since the booster is the same as the first two shots why all the contortions. If it was safe to take the first two shots and the third shot is the same as the first????
2021-09-23 00:39:58,"It was known already that the formerly very high efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech would go down over time.

I got my second Pfizer-BioNTech shot on February 3. Ergo I am already overdue for the booster, and nothing will keep me from getting my third shot of their vaccine.

Two weeks ago I started wearing a mask again outdoors, observed social distancing,  because none other advanced country has as many anti-vaxxer per capita than the good ol' US of A.

2021-09-23 00:44:34,"The delay and refusal of the FDA and CDC to roll out boosters to everyone is outrageous. Only from such an incompetent agency could there be any confusion over what is already known - unless you want to force Americans to suffer needless disease and downtime, risk of long COVID, and expose their unvaccinated children because of breakthrough infections, then everyone should be getting boosters now.  Well, actually, it should have been done months ago.  And there is zero data suggesting any real health downside/risk beyond pure speculation.  That's why the UK, France, Germany, Israel, and other countries have already ACTED to protect their citizens and started giving boosters.  Biden should demand the resignation of the heads of both the CDC and FDA and take matters in hand.  He should also make clear that the goal is to prevent disease, prevent infection, prevent transmission, not merely keep people from going to the hospital or dying.  How dare the FDA presume to condemn us to needless illness when a safe, effective solution exists."
2021-09-23 00:46:51,"A booster shot for those who are not immune compromised or will benefit from a booster is just plain selfishness of those who take a third shot unnecessarily. They care not for anyone but themselves. Call them the 'narcissist's movement'

The US Government is supposed to purchase 500 million Pfizer shots to give to those countries in need of shots; in America we have shots available now that can be distributed around the globe, that we are afraid will go to waste by December due to not being used by Americans. Let these people use them in countries where shots are difficult to acquire.

Take away patent rights, and allow others to tap into vaccines for distribution around the world, for all people. It is a Pandemic not a local virus. Know the difference. What is happening in America is happening all around the globe. We all want opened economies...if so, then come together to make it happen, not, not happen like we are doing today. 

This program is even worse than the ACA, which was an attempt to offer health care in America; in 2022 will your health insurance policy cover your covid virus infection?

Do Americans really know and realize how bad this virus is, how bad the program is and how bad we really don't know what to really do about it. We are constantly reading what an agenda is telling us about this. But do they even know? No.

Is it better today for you ,family, friends ...than in 2020? It is not. And if you think it is? What and why do you feel this way."

Data support giving it to everybody. Not a single member of the advisory board raised any science-based contr-arguments.
The only arguments raised were based on population or economics and not on medicine.
Oh, I forgot, there was one that wished to have more data.
FDA and CDC are administrative pannels that rule based on unscientific administrative laws passed by unscientific congress.
Everybody should get the 3rd dose for the simple reason that is more dangerous and more expensive to draw your blood and test it to see if you have enough immunity. By the way, no insurance is willing to pay for the full testing of COVID-19 immunity. Just evaluating if you have antibodies is not enough."
2021-09-23 00:50:29,"I like how now it takes three separate jabs to be ""safe."" I got Covid once and have been perfectly safe ever since. That was over a year and a half ago now since I got Covid and Im just fine. Just got back from a long vacation and didnt get sick at all. In fact, since I got Covid I havent gotten sick from anything, my immune system seems to be kicked into overdrive. And my Covid experience was like two days of a cold followed by feeling just fine. I dont understand why naturally immune people need three separate jabs from vaccines that dont seem to do anything (I mean, the vaccinated still are wearing masks and social distancing, if the vaccine worked why would that or a booster be so necessary?). Id pay out of my own pocket for an antibody test. If my antibodies are still good, why do I need a vaccine? If not, Im fine with getting a vaccine to get my antibodies up to par. It seems pretty logical to me, I dont get why thats not allowed."

…that cites studies suggesting the Moderna shot provides greater levels of protection for longer than the Pfizer-BioNTech.

How long until someone answers the obvious question these two articles pose: Is it safe and effective for people who received the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech regimen to get a booster of the Moderna instead?"
2021-09-23 00:59:22,"It's not rocket science.   Israel's medical establishment deemed   people who were really sick with Covid to be  seriously ill and then took steps to prevent this.

The US health system knows many things, but the Israeli health system knows one big thing."
2021-09-23 01:11:10,Quantity of antibodies alone are insufficient. Boosters not only increase quantity but also quality of antibodies. A higher quality antibodies bind viral antigens better.
2021-09-23 01:11:24,"The President is the chief administrator. He could and should declare that anyone who wants a booster 6 months after their second Moderna or Pfizer vaccination WILL NOT have any administration regulation that PREVENTS their doing so. 
That is different from telling folks they ought to or that they have to; just we (FDA, CDC) won't stand in their path."
2021-09-23 01:11:25,"From  the start, immunologists have been saying that a month between doses doesn't provide optimum protection. One month between doses was correctly administered  to  get people adequate immunity, quickly, during the height of the pandemic.  The evidence is overwhelming that a third dose causes a dramatic increase in immune response.  Fauci agrees. Now, everyone who wants a booster should be able to walk in a get one of Pfizer, Modern, or J and J.

What is going on with the CDC and FDA restricting access to boosters is theater having to do with the WHO telling countries not to give boosters until the planet is vaccinated and the notion that giving boosters will have a negative effect on people getting their first shot.  The problem with countries around the world not being able to get a first shot is money.   Biden has committed hundreds of $millions to vaccinate the world when tens of $billions are needed, from the US and from other nations as well.  The Americans who have made the decision not to get vaccinated will not change their minds, no matter what.  In fact, efforts to get them vaccinated only hardens their resolve.   

There are millions of doses about to expire in the US right now, and doses are wasted everyday with half-used vials being throw away.   The slow moving bureaucrats in the FDA, CDC, and NIH have not be the heroes of this pandemic.  The best time open up boosters to everyone was two months ago.  The second best time is now."

2021-09-23 01:19:33,"No one really knows the full extent of side effects of these vaccines because they haven’t been studied as long as normal vaccines would have been.  Given the pandemic crisis, we are basically saying that as long as there are no significant side effects, we should take the vaccine.  Fair enough for the initial vaccine but I am not so sure about the booster.  The body’s long-term immune system is now already aware and can react to the virus albeit with a bit of a delay.  There must be another driving consideration for pushing boosters and it could well be not to create panic of increasing cases and deaths in part because we may start running out of hospital beds again.  The optics would be awful if that were to happen.  Let’s hope the booster doesn’t have unwelcome side effects for those who take it."
2021-09-23 01:20:36,"I'm five months in.  I will be getting that booster in 30 days.  I'll take a cue from the Republicans, personal responsibility.  Take every opportunity to protect yourself because half the country won't get the shot.  The fewer of them that don't get the shot means there will be more shots available for the rest of us that do want them.

Now, if we can just get all the kids vaccinated, this nightmare will be over, at least for half of us, the ones that employ personal responsibility."

I am sure there are people who have died because these images terrify them and they may fear great pain, even though modern needles cause little pain.

As far as I'm concerned I'm fully vaccinated. If the shot is not effective enough to last more than a few months, I'm certainly not going to elbow my way into line to get another one. Show me evidence from neutral parties that have no monetary stake in the outcome that it has long lasting effects and that it's effective against current variants. Otherwise, I'll pass on shots every 6 months."
2021-09-23 01:34:19,"The FDA essentially has declared it's every man (woman/child) for himself. Sensing the bureaucratic confusion and analysis paralysis at the FDA, I went ahead and scheduled a 3rd Moderna shot in early September.  No questions asked by the local pharmacy. The side-effects were noticeably milder than the second dose. My wife is scheduled for her booster next week. I am allowing myself the first optimistic feelings since Delta emerged.  We, the vaccinated and the super-vaccinated, are the backbone to defeating this scourge.  Get the booster and give yourself a psychological break as well. You deserve it. It is the patriotic thing to do."

2021-09-23 01:51:45,"Can anyone please do math?  Because the most basic things about these vaccines, after time, are clear.

Phizer is an amazing product.  Even one shot, if we can get everyone to take it would remove the risk

A third dose is even better.  So even if outside the fda risk group, if in a dense city, lie and get another first dose

I lucked into moderna.i may get another booster."

We made our decisions regarding boosters based on the best information we have, and based on what we know about our own personal health risks.  

Realistically, in the last year and a half, the CDC has not been a consistent source of sound advice.    That’s an observation, and not a condemnation of science."
2021-09-23 01:56:26,"It appears these people will actually be Guinea pigs since the booster shoots have only been tested on a very small group!

2021-09-23 01:58:34,"I too am very disappointed in the FDA’s decision. I’m 57 and received my second Pfizer shot in April, so I’m coming on 6 months. I’m pretty healthy, but I’ve had several family members of different ages who got Covid this past year, at least two who were vaccinated and they were hospitalized. 

Fortunately my 65 year-old SO will qualify and maybe his kids who work in high risk occupations, but we have several grandchildren under 12 who are not yet vaccinated. My SO also has a condition that puts him at risk for severe Covid. As his partner and primary caregiver, I feel at the very least I ought to be eligible as well so he can have all the protection he can get, plus I really don’t even want to get so-called “mild” Covid and risk long haul Covid. And we live in Texas, and in a rural county that has 48% of the population full vaccinated. 

Both the Israeli report and CDC report from last week were not reassuring. If Pfizer effectiveness against hospitalization wanes at 4 months to 77%, what is it at 6 or 8 months? 50%? 39% (per the Israelis)? Not good enough. Are they going to wait until people younger than 65 are hospitalized and/or die? I’m hoping that maybe the CDC will come to the conclusion that the general population can get boosters, but who knows?"
2021-09-23 01:59:44,This is total garbage.  We have a nation full of morons who refuse to get even one shot.  Those of us with a functioning brain should be able to get a booster---regardless of age.
2021-09-23 02:02:09,"Given the dismal uptake of vaccines so far, if they opened boosters up to anyone who wanted one, with guidance on categories of higher vs. lower risk, I would bet money that half or less of the already vaccinated would get one.  I’m just not at all convinced that allowing boosters to everyone who wants one would make a significant dent in the world’s vaccine supply.  It’s one thing when the anti-vaxers don’t trust the CDC.  It’s frightening when people who have full faith in science decide they have to go rogue to protect themselves because the regulatory agencies aren’t looking out for them."
2021-09-23 02:06:34,"I got the J & J vaccine back in March.  Then 2 rounds of Pfizer in May.  Then another shot of J & J at my CVS MinuteClinic a few weeks ago.  I was asked if I had been vaccinated in the past two weeks each time after being initially vaccinated.  So I never was required to lie.  And I'm glad I did do all of that- because I worked with an elderly immunocompromised person and on the front lines.  I pay attention to the news, the science... and then make the choice in my best interest for myself and those around me."
2021-09-23 02:08:11,This is a sensible F.D.A. authorization of a choice of a Pfizer booster for 65+ people who were previously vaccinated and presumed to be fully vaccinated. It also makes sense that a booster will be allowed for those at a high risk for Covid-19 due to genetic or acquired immunodeficiency and had previously received vaccines but are below 65. I met a lady who said due to her medical condition that places her in high risk group that her doctor also recommended getting the booster. When in doubt consult your doctor before making any decisions on booster.
2021-09-23 02:18:54,"So, as someone with a risky health condition under 65, but not in a dangerous job it seems like what the FDA is saying is I might need and benefit from a booster. A healthy 35 year old first responder might need one. So there's a need. But I can't have one because... I guess I don't really know why?"
2021-09-23 02:17:42,"All these people complaining. This stuff takes time to sort out as it is constantly changing. Yes we have gotten conflicting information and it will continue as it is a fluid situation with a lot of moving parts and billions of people wanting immediate answers from the people wodking on the problem. Shut up already, you are so lucky to basically be the amongst the first in line to recieve this miracle drug when entire continents have barely gotten a shipment. 
 We Americans are a selfish, ugly lot."
2021-09-23 02:17:45,"“Millions of Americans who received the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are still waiting to learn whether they, too, can get boosters. The F.D.A. is expected to take up the question of boosters for them in short order.”

So tired of this silly pretense that you “can’t” get a third shot until the FDA says you qualify. Yes, you can. Just go get one; several million Americans already have done so, as have my spouse and I, as have our friends; no one we know has been turned away. We went to our county health department offices, where we were asked only whether our doctors had recommended that we get a third dose (they had).  

The local health departments and millions of Americans are simply ignoring the stenotic, politically divided bureaucracy that is the FDA. So is CVS, from what I’ve heard. The FDA has yet to provide final approval for the Moderna vaccine, which millions of Americans (including we) got months ago. Our third shot was also Moderna. 

Caution is good; sufficient, reliable data is essential. With breakthrough cases mounting, however, mounting data suggestions that virtually everyone will need a third dose, and clear evidence from both Israel and the UK that the third shot is the charm, FDA policy has passed the boundary between the scientific and insane.

Ask your doctor; if she says you will need a third shot, then get that shot now. You do not have to wait."
2021-09-23 02:20:54,"While the Americans are debating who, among their population, must be given the third (booster) shot, a major part of the rest of the world is scrounging around to get doses to give at least the first shot to their people.  This is what it would be with all the best intentions in the world. After all, as everyone knows, self-preservation (apart from sex, of course) is the  foremost basic instinct of all living organisms.  Human beings,  particularly those living in the oldest democracy in the world, who have endowed themselves with the constitutional right to bear arms to protect themselves and their kith and kin and not have to  rely on the state to give that protection, cannot be exempt from the working of that basic instinct!"
2021-09-23 02:25:25,The anti-vaccination people will now be up to three shots behind!
2021-09-23 02:26:22,The FDA approval cycle time is usually 10 years.
2021-09-23 02:30:11,"The US is giving booster shots to over 65s , The UK is giving booster shots to over 50s , they are each basing it on the same information , or you would think so , should they not be talking to each other and come to the same conclusion ."
2021-09-23 02:36:25,What about J&J. My fear is they will only authorize boosters for at risks groups. J&J is not as good as mRNA.
2021-09-23 02:54:46,"A start - how about for everyone after 6 months, and emergency authorization for 5-11 year-olds in addition to a presidential mandate everyone 5 and up be vaccinated within (howeverlong it takes to make enough supply) and everyone go masked in public - if not that at least vax and mask if taking any interstate transportation, especially aircrafts, proceeding next to automobiles, even if privately owned? And a mandate anyone with 1 shot of mRNA, who failed to show up within 5 weeks for a second, receive a second and a booster a month later
Mr. President, our patience wearing thin with deliberately ignorant or misinformed Americans who refuse to behave patriotically, that is, take a minor step at a risk approaching zero to save the nation."
2021-09-23 03:02:36,"I am a 61 year old teacher who got vaccinated as soon as I could. My second dose was March 17th. I have been watching the news closely since the Biden administration announced booster shots would be coming this week. I have 40 students per class, many of whom are not vaccinated. Release the boosters to those who want them. The data shows that the efficacy of the vaccines start to wane after 5 or 6 months. Dr. Fauci has said on many news channels in the last week that they have always considered the vaccines to require 3 doses. There are “fully vaccinated”people who have died from Covid 19."
2021-09-23 03:07:58,"I think that there's too much focus on boosters and not enough on measures that let vaccinated people get on with their lives, while feeling secure, and put pressure on stragglers to get vaccinated.

Several major European countries have implemented vaccination passes. As of today, Canadian provinces covering 95% of the country's population have also done so. The Canadian passes are required for non-essential activities like going to restaurants, gyms, cinemas and sports events.

The passes protect vaccinated people and prevent unvaccinated people from infecting one-another. The European experience, and early Canadian data, says that they will result in a significant increase in the number of 18-39 year olds, who are socially active and lagging on vaccination, who get onboard with vaccination.

So far, only New York City and San Francisco have adopted passes here. In New York State, the Excelsior Pass, which we have had since March, could have been used the same way as the European and Canadian passes. Instead, Bill de Blasio has sidelined the Excelsior Pass, and introduced a watered-down version, requiring proof that can easily be fabricated, called the Key to NY City Pass.

We are so obsessed with vaccines and boosters that we are ignoring obvious ways to reduce infections and get vaccination up."
2021-09-23 03:14:03,"Okay, I get it. After 6 months, the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine drops off a bit. It still seems to protect against serious illness and death, but it’s less effective against contracting the virus. This seems like a good reason to recommend it for people over 65. And for other vulnerable groups.

But shouldn’t the real question be: is it better to give a booster to a person who already has a good amount of protection (especially against serious illness and death) OR to give the shot to someone else who has NO PROTECTION?

We’re really sending mixed messages to the world. On the one hand, Biden says we should give more vaccines to the rest of the world. But on the other hand, we want to give boosters to our own citizens who already have significant protection. Seems like it would be better to send more doses to other countries than to start administering millions of boosters to our own people.

The sooner we can immunize the whole world, the sooner we will stop the growth and mutation of this virus. We don’t live on an isolated island. The virus mutations from other countries will find a way into this country. It’s already happened and it will happen again."
2021-09-23 04:09:24,"I am in my 60s, but not above 65 as yet and my job teaching in a class room with no windows to 50+ young University students put me at high risk of catching Covid-19. Unlike FDA and CDC experts, I worry about falling sick and taking a week off, even if I am not hospitalized or intubated (""severe"" disease). I am appalled that these regulatory bodies only care for hospital capacity and death, not the suffering that comes without being hospitalized.  I always wear an N-95 mask and do not drink or eat at work for fear of catching Covid-19. I am  very disappointed that FDA did not approve booster doses for a more broader group of Americans."
2021-09-23 04:31:00,"Newcastle England a medium sized city with 2 universities right downtown , its freshers week and from photos in the local evening chronicle newspaper everyone of those students is out on the town , the city is packed and students are standing in huge lineups to get in clubs and bars , and Newcastle is famous for its nightlife and the amount of drinking establishments , so while the over 50s are learning about booster shots the young students are saying pandemic what pandemic , and those 25 to 50 are probably saying what about me . Its a strange old world isn't it ."
2021-09-23 05:01:47,"I would like to know whether or not it is actually true that there are millions of doses of the vaccine near expiration. Is this a verifiable fact, what would be the source of that information? And the reason I ask is because, normally, I go pretty closely along with whatever Dr. Fouchi has to say, but if this was the case, then I think that people of all ages ought to be able to request a booster.  Because some may feel that they are not as strong and healthy as as it may appear. I am over 70, so I'm not saying this for my own benefit. I can get the booster."
2021-09-23 05:09:23,"I'm all for ""booster shots""; I don't want to be on a ventilator spending a long vacation in Club ICU-Med or Club Dead, either. 

But isn't the big invisible elephant in the room: booster for what? Will the booster shots address such emerging mutations as Lambda which I seem to have read may largely be immune to our ""old"" Covid-19 vaccines? Are we putting out boosters for a game that is almost over, not for adversaries that are yet to take the field? People can't be given endless ""boosters"", so shouldn't we measure twice before we cut once?"
2021-09-23 05:48:29,"I want my freedom, too… to decide for myself whether I should get a booster.  While there may be some disagreement about whether a booster would be helpful for everyone, none of these medical experts have ever shown that a booster would be harmful.  So if I decide that I want to get a booster shot in order to further protect myself against those unvaccinated people clamoring for their freedom, I should also have the freedom to do what I want."
2021-09-23 07:25:52,"I am all for ""booster shots""; with a few rare cases of the vaccine completely unable to stop the mutations and different variants, boosters should either be mandatory or at least highly encouraged. I believe everyone would rather deal with a needle than having to be on a ventilator or stuck in the ICU."
2021-09-23 04:58:38,"Meanwhile, as an historical political circus around ‘freedom’ rages on, the virus will mutate and become worse…and then what? What if this becomes even more deadly than a virus capable of killing 1 out of 500 Americans? What part of science and reasoning has left our collective conscious?"
2021-09-23 05:56:08,Worldwide Covid deaths are down by 13 percent and cases are down as well! This is good news. Before everyone jumps on boosters maybe some emphasis on treatments and overall health can finally take precedence?
2021-09-23 05:29:13,"While I know buried in all of this is the fact that booster shots for those who received the Moderna vaccine or later, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be up for approval at some point, the booster announcements that are coming out now are as if almost everyone has been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.That is not the case. There should be some kind of cohesive schedule so that people know when their vaccine may be available as a booster. I also think it it is highly likely that if a winter surge hits, then boosters will be available to all--after the fact.  I wish more attention would be paid to Israel; they are giving boosters to everyone over the age of 12."
2021-09-23 07:49:07,The number of people suggesting boosters should be available despite lack of medical evidence is astounding. I guess they only believe in science when it backs up their emotionally-driven opinions.
2021-09-23 03:56:42,"I’m thinking that Biden et al. are not serious about getting this virus under control. Biden was blaming the continued evolution of the virus on people who refuse a vaccine. 
If they were serious they would have allowed production of vaccine generics months ago. But instead they blame those who hesitate or refuse vaccination. 
Humanity can not reach herd immunity by making it more difficult for people to get a vaccine."
2021-09-23 09:06:43,"It’s interesting that booster shots are approved for people who got the Pfizer vaccine, because its efficacy has dropped to the level of the J&J vaccine.
I’m all in favor of booster shots if they will help to protect individual and public health. Yet I remain concerned about the level of protection the J&J vaccine has provided to me. How cautious *should* I be, beyond wearing a face mask indoors and avoiding crowds?"
2021-09-23 09:56:28,"In parts of the world people can’t get even one vaccine shot. In late October I will get my third shot. I am grateful to all the scientists involved in the making of these wonderful vaccines. The world needs more, why can’t we produce or share the information on the production. People are dying unnecessarily it can’t be all about the money at this point. We always have money for war. Let’s go to war against covid 19."
2021-09-23 04:32:40,"So I’m in the senior age group, but my initial shot was the Johnson  & Johnson. Do I wait til their booster gets approved or go with Pfizer?"
2021-09-23 05:40:21,"Public Health a matter of vigilance and implementation:
High risk occupations deserve utmost respect and attention staying healthy..."
2021-09-23 09:36:50,"I just learned a friend already got his booster shot yesterday. He is 60. So this sentence in the story is important because boosters are already being given: “As a practical matter, since the F.D.A. fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as a two-dose regimen last month, physicians have had broad latitude to prescribe a third dose to people they deemed in need of one.”"
2021-09-23 04:09:02,The FDA jumped the gun on this one. Fauci was/is right. Multiple studies now showing a drop-off in efficacy over time across the board (not just elderly) between Pfizer and Moderna. And no wonder: The original Moderna vaccine used more than 3x the amount of mrna than Pfizer. Why didn’t they just wait a few days until they had more data (one study came in literally a day before the advisory board meeting). The Biden administration likely based their rollout plan based on what Pfizer knew already. Another botched decision which will need to be modified soon.
2021-09-23 07:17:18,"After a slow, chaotic start at the beginning of the pandemic, France is now 71% fully vaccinated compared to 54% in US. As of last week anyone over 65 vaccinated for at least six months is eligible for booster. My husband and I received our booster last week, and although we still wear masks in many places, as per requirements, the relative peace of mind is priceless. The French can be a cantankerous and stubborn lot, who will bridle at anything they perceive as unjustified government infringement on their “liberté.” There are still some vaccine resisters here fueled by conspiracy theories and medical misinformation on the Web, but there is no Fox News (and now Newsmax) here, stoking constant fear of the vaccine and loathing of the government, and that, along with the “pass sanitaire” has certainly made a difference in vaccine take up compared to Red States in the US."

2021-09-23 11:05:52,"There will be the rise of another variant that may make Delta look tame by comparison. As many people as possible must be vaccinated worldwide - or, we need a newer more powerful vaccine. Will boosters really help? For a while, maybe. If only first-world nations are fully vaccinated it won't help."
2021-09-23 12:38:12,"As a moderately liberal Democrat, a Moderna recipient now 7 months fully vaccinated,  I am disgusted by the confusion our current administration has created that has been caused by this booster question. Many of my friends have rushed to get an additional shot of Pfizer or Moderna, faking (yes that is the word) immunity deficiencies to “qualify” as they consider this to be a life or death issue.  On medical advice, our family physicians are advising waiting even though we will be age qualified, as it is not clear if the booster will have a different formulation, or will just be another shot. And why the delay on Moderna, and, even more important, childhood vaccinations for my grandchildren? 
I am sick of hearing about the need to review the data submitted. Those responsible for doing that should be working 24/7 to complete this task. In my former corporate years, excuses in priority matters would not be tolerated, and lead to the firing of these individuals. THIS is a pandemic—not just business as usual—and delay of any kind is inexcusable."

2021-09-23 16:29:57,"I wonder if J&J's vaccine had been just a touch lower in efficacy if it would have been rolled out as a two-shot regimen as well, and would have joined the ranks of >90% efficacious vaccines."
2021-09-22 23:53:49,"55, obese and seven months past my second Pfizer dose.  I’ve locked back down again in anticipation of getting a booster.  They are so worried about hospitalizations and deaths but completely ignore the fact that even mild cases have led to a huge number of chronic long Covid cases that pose an even larger long-term health care disaster.  And plenty of people seem to be getting hit with “breakthrough” cases and ending up in the hospital.  I had no reaction to either Pfizer shot and have no idea how protected I am now.  If more people stopped listening to conservative media and just got vaccinated, we would be out of this already.  As it stands, it looks likely that this pandemic will last for years.  Those who want boosters to protect themselves from the morons who refuse to be vaccinated should be able to get them.  Until then, I will continue to stay on lockdown."
2021-09-23 00:27:51,"People should be aware that many of the “experts” who have spoken out against booster shots are showing a gross indifference concerning your health. There is zero evidence that it is a threat, and much evidence that it is a benefit. They simply want to take those doses and export them. I am surprised that they have not spoken out against authorizing the vaccines for children. After all, children are at lower risk from covid than adults in Africa. Same exact logic."

2021-09-23 10:40:37,"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't one of the most important responsibilities of a parent the protection of their child? So WHY are so many parents fighting for the ""right"" to endanger their child? Masks and mask mandates protect children from Covid-19 which is a deadly virus."
2021-09-23 10:43:37,"Our daughter has down syndrome. She was supposed to start school this year but didn’t due to the risk. Our older kids are not in school either. We’re homeschooling them due to the risk to their sister. It’s been hard on everyone. 

We’re a military family and have no choice in where we live. We’re from a New England state where things are under control. Here in the deep south it’s bedlam. Nobody wears masks. We rarely leave the house and when we do we wear n95 masks. We don’t leave the base, our house within the gates of the installation. Masks are technically required here but only some people wear them correctly and keep them on. Just shopping for groceries at the commissary is terrifying. 

Yesterday was the first time I had left the base in weeks. I took one of the kids to the dentist. Nobody in the waiting room was wearing a mask and more kept coming in. I had to request to wait in a separate room and deal with the eye rolls. Then they refused to keep the door of the treatment room closed. Nobody here takes it seriously and all I can do is pray my husband is reassigned to a state or overseas base where sanity prevails."

2021-09-23 10:41:58,"The obvious solution for anti mask mandate Republican Govenots is to divide kids up into two separated groups, one for masked students and one for unmasked. This way EVERY parent gets what they want.

So why haven’t the Republican Govenots instituted such a policy? Because they know exactly what would happen. The unmasked pods of kids would end up having much higher case rates for covid and they (the anti-mask Republican Govenots) would be proven to be wrong. So children have to continue to suffer.

I feel bad for anyone living under the insanity of Republican control during this pandemic."
2021-09-23 10:50:05,This goes both ways. In schools with mask mandates kids with disabilities who can’t tolerate masks are not allowed to come in. And I wish the author had tried to find out what the experiences of deaf children who lipread have been.
2021-09-23 10:51:46,"I live in a neighboring county. We saw a huge spike in cases within the school system, and it still took until mid-September for them to institute an opt-out-able mask mandate. It’s unsettling how many people are willing to sacrifice others for their own convenience or selfish reasons."
2021-09-23 11:12:27,"There should not be a blanket guideline for districts that vary widely in needs. Areas with high infection rates need mask mandates. Areas of relative low infection rates should be able to have the option.

Mandating masks or not is an important decision that should rest on the needs of the districts, and those needs are not all the same."
2021-09-23 11:32:25,"If people want to opt out of masks, then there are a few ways to keep kids safe:
1. Daily required rapid Covid testing for each person entering the school
2. High levels of ventilations with HEPA filtering and open windows, making the indoor air as fresh as outdoor air
3. Vaccine requirement for every person who is eligible.
All of these are less onerous than masks, and masks aren’t expensive or onerous. 
Guess what these same school districts are going to do, though?"
2021-09-23 11:35:39,"I don’t really believe that masks affect children emotional and physical health.  Maybe in some especial cases.  But it’s 
mostly the approach and the conduct, WE as adults, take in front of our children that affect them.
 
Positive experiences in childhood can provide a foundation for creating better health in adulthood. So, knowing that most children adopt the beliefs of their surroundings; a more thoughtful approach about masks can make a big difference.  

Children learn by modeling, not through politics– they observe the words and behaviors of those around them, especially from parents and replicate them. 

Looking at the parents’ behavior in the video clip, reinforces the fact to why do we always go back to our childhood when in therapy????

 This is definitely not about the safety of our children.  It’s about being right no matter what."
2021-09-23 11:39:20,"It is very difficult to read this story.  I am a doctor.  Wearing a mask does not impair breathing; we do it all day in surgery.  Oxygen is exchanged through the mask.  Claiming that wearing a mask is bad for children makes zero sense.  There may be a medical condition where the masks can obstruct breathing but those would be very rare. 

It is common sense that wearing a mask prevents transmission of airborn  viruses.  Colleagues who wear PPE do not get infected at work.  

My son has a disability and homeschooling was academic regression.  I am not a special education teacher, a speech therapist, an occupational therapist.  He needs to be with his educators in person.  I feel he is safe because everyone masks and he is vaccinated, as well as his teachers.

I recently was infected by a family member, at home with masks off.   Because I am vaccinated, my illness will likely be short.  I will not go to work to minimize the risk to patients.  

This is not complicated.  Wear masks to protect others."

And if they get COVID and are not vaccinated they should be low priority in the overrun hospitals.
Why are we so weak in enacting mandates for the public good?"
2021-09-23 10:49:05,"A total lack of leadership. From governors on down to school board members, there is a level of buck-passing that is nauseating, cowardly and unjust.

Is “survival of the fittest”, “survival of the most open to internet conspiracy theories” the best we can do? I really and truly hope lawyers begin to look at how the lack of mask mandates infringes on student’s rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act."
2021-09-23 11:24:09,"As a person who was born and grew up very near Franklin, I can tell you that the quiet slow life you gained by moving to the area may not be worth putting up with the mindset of the people in the area.  The Franklin I knew had livestock auctions by Colonel Beasley and paraded cows down the side streets.   While the cows are gone, and the old high school that burned down is forgotten except for a marker, nothing has changed.  It's still a southern bible belt area, with a lot of religious people.  Like most southern towns, schools, churches, and local sports are their life.  Nothing wrong with that except they are particularly gullible to the idea that they are going to lose something.  Nothing makes people crazy than the idea they might lose something.  The people who ignore Covid, don't mask, and won't vaccinate are a large vocal minority, but let me repeat, they are VOCAL.  Churches in the south have become immersed in politics.  Preachers tell people who to vote for from the pulpit.  Good jobs are wired.  If I sound bitter, yes, I am.  I am a son of the south, yet I could not find a job, simply because I did not attend the right church.  I had to leave my home state.  I still love Tennessee, but I could not live there with the mindset of many of the people, especially the elected ones. The quiet sedate appearance of the south is a facade.  Those of you who realized that Tennessee wasn't a good fit, pass the word along to others.  I am so sorry you may be in the wrong place."

Some special needs students have a provision that exempts them from wearing a mask. 

We really haven’t had a big problem with other students not wearing a mask. Most of them are thrilled to be back in school, and they really don’t want to return to virtual learning.

A public health denying parent who puts forward a specious argument about personal freedom yet puts their child at risk for an infection that may expand into a horrifically bad one is not putting their child's interests ahead of their own ego.  In the face of preventable disease, who will take responsibility should any child suffer long-haul symptoms, death, or infection of others if their child is found to have infected anyone?  Will these foolish parents take that responsibility and pay for the adverse health consequences caused by their callous attitude toward members of their community?

By any sane measure masks have a single purpose.  To protect kids from spreading Covid.  The masks in question are nowhere near N95 standards.  There are no standards of what a mask ought to be, as long as a kid has any thin cloth or paper in front of their nose it’s good enough.  Drinking soft drinks is far more harmful to kids than masks and we are perfectly fine with it.  The real issue is masks and vaccines have been put on the Democrat side of the ledger and parents are worried that once their kid puts on a mask they will turn into liberals.  Fighting mask mandates is their way of trying to keep their children where they belong and Republican governors couldn’t agree more."

And guess what?  I turn to the whiteboard to write something down, and when I turn back to face the room, I see, in a class of 14 students, 4 full faces (mask pulled down to chin) and another half dozen noses (mask pulled down below nose).  If I tell them to pull up the mask, it stays up for a few minutes, then next time I turn around, it goes down again.  It's a losing battle, and I have no heart to be policing these kids' mask usage when I'm trying to teach them how to factor quadratic equations.

These are affluent, bright, well-educated and well-mannered (for the most part) teens.  They're not being defiant; they are seeking their own comfort.  I can't imagine that mask mandates are implemented effectively at any school in America.  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but if the students in this article have conditions which make it dangerous for them to be around unmasked children, then every school in America is dangerous for them.

My guess is that the states that have made masks optional are at least in part bowing to this reality - it's unworkable and even somewhat dishonest to require conduct that half or more of children will simply not adhere to.

This was the policy throughout the pandemic, even when those communities experienced similar or higher surges than we did last year. Kids with disabilities were given their services at school. There was no ""remote option.""  Now Europe is continuing this policy with greater reassurance through the combination of high rates of adult vaccination and regular testing.

 It feels like we will be mired in the mask debate forever, rather than focusing on the measures that make the most difference: adult vaccination and widely available, regular testing. Biden allocated billions for schools to perform testing. Where is it?"

My daughter (vaccinated) got covid from them and was sent home for 10 days to quarantine and missed class her first week of school as a freshman. The unvaccinated students got to stay in school because they refused to get tested.

If anti-mask and anti-vaccine fervor is coming from the pulpit along with a steady stream of politics, it's about time we recognize that religion needs to be regulated and taxed more than it already is.

Before balking at this suggestion, recognize that we already do regulate religion to some degree. We would not allow people to perform human sacrifice because it is their religious beliefs. In effect, that is exactly what is happening if churches a leading the anti mask and vaccination charge. 

And, if a church is using most of its influence and time campaigning for various politicians, it should be deemed a political organization taxed and regulated accordingly. Allowing churches to act as political organizations violates the essence of the establishment clause.  Just imagine how many of these people would react if a Mosque preaching Islam starting holding political rallies in their towns?

At least I understand one thing about these right wing people. Freedom for them means and has always meant oppression of others. That, apparently, will not change until the rest of us have had enough. I, for one, am already there."

What is the relationship between being a person with a handicap and COVID, down syndrome and autism in particular, since the boy was trotted out in the article.

This former mild-mannered nurse went off on how she opted her children out of wearing masks, how no one was going to tell her what to do, and that kids who tested positive had been asymptomatic.  It was zero to psycho in less than 2 seconds. I have never seen the anger, the venom that the simple task of mask wearing provokes.  Common sense is not common anymore and civility has been replaced with something I'm not willing to tolerate.

I’m with the mother who will never be able to look at some of her neighbors the same way again.

Why the press is ignoring this is journalistic malpractice. If the Republican Party was refusing to enforce drunk driving laws, arguing that the government was intruding on people’s personal freedom to choose what goes into their bodies while hypocritically calling on people to ‘act responsibly’, there would be outrage. 

The Republican Party effectively has press permission to behave badly. It’s a big part of the reason we are where we are today. It’s not just democracy that dies in darkness; we have a body count here measured in the hundreds of thousands.

Advocate for vaccines, test regularly, protect the vulnerable (by homeschooling, if the community spread rate is high), but don't think masks are a panacea, or act like they are. They aren't."
2021-09-23 13:40:22,"Excuse me for going of the tracks, but while this article is about masking in schools it brushes upon another issue that has puzzled me since my kid was in public school years ago.

Ms Hart moved with her special needs son from Cincinnati to a quiet suburb of Nashville to get her son into a school that would better meet his needs. Now this school district and its taxpayers are responsible for the additional costs of educating her son. For some special needs children these costs are substantial.  And she is quoted in the story stating “I’m used to arguing with a district to get my kid what he needs.” 

In my New Jersey school district we pay substantial property taxes and a lot of the money goes to take care of our special needs students. Parents of special needs students across the country know this and move in to my district and others like it so that their kids can get the best education possible for them. 

I don’t blame the parents for doing what is best for their kids and their kids certainly deserve an education that meets their special needs, but it is unfair to generous and overburdened taxpayers to move a kid into the district just because of that generosity. And when more special needs children move into a district, because of its reputation of spending money on those kids, the costs go up. It's an impossible circle to break.  

There has got to be a better way to handle this on a national level."

That wearing masks does not prevent her children from breathing oxygen?

That air is actually mostly nitrogen, not oxygen?

Republicans 'are angry at someone (elites, liberals, the gov't, the establishment) for telling them how they ought to live. Trump might not have materially improved their positions, but he was willing to stick it to those groups—and if that requires antidemocratic means, so be it. The current countermajoritarian resistance to masks and vaccine mandates emanates from the same feeling. Many conservatives are tired of being told how to live by the majority, and they want to live exactly as they please, even if that means they may die—and even if that means making other people sick along the way.'"

We have become a nation of “I” and “Me”.  We no longer value what’s good for the community. My 5 year old nephew who was recently diagnosed with autism is able to wear a mask.  Children can wear masks, it’s only when their parents tell them they can’t or don’t have to that they have difficulty. What are we teaching our children today? That if something is inconvenient for them they don’t have to do it? Whatever happened to accepting responsibility for ourselves and caring about how our actions affect others?"

Think 30% opt-out rate is bad? Try 80% in my daughter's classroom, at a ""masking optional"" district. Needless to say, we yanked her. The staff is barely 50% vaccinated but we don't really know the true numbers, as the superintendent (who just got a nice raise) is so incompetent, he can't even be bothered to insist on seeing shot cards.

This pandemic will simmer down eventually but I'm guessing the unvaccinated numbers where I am (rural Maine) will remain around 25%, making public school truly a dangerous place for at least the next year."

Masks at school have never been compulsory. I asked my son the other day and he said 'maybe two or three kids' wear them. Testing is required twice per week and free tests are sent home with the kids. If a kid tests positive he stays home but everyone else carries on as normal. 

When I read that some American school districts were completely shut down for in person learning for over a year I was shocked. I'm also shocked to read that people wear masks OUTDOORS? Throughout the pandemic I have rarely seen anyone over here wear a mask outdoors."

Yet there are families in our school district in a rural part of the state that just don't care to abide by the mask mandate and as a classroom teacher basically my only tool is reminding students to put their masks back on.  My administrators have not responded to my request for help with consequences, and other teachers and coaches wear their masks incorrectly.  I have a child under 12 and an older vaccinated child - who despite being an athlete and musician with a 4.0 has has epilepsy and in the eyes of COVID-deniers, her life is obviously worth less to them... as she would be, ""But she has underlying conditions.""  They say about our elderly in our county who have died that 1-""They are old,"" or 2-""They died WITH COVID,"" or 3-""They were diagnosed a long time ago, but they died of a heart attack, everything's COVID now.""  We started back to full time in person school and the only mitigation strategy really is masks since the majority of families have chosen not to vaccinate their teens.  Many of my colleagues (who care about the mask mandate) feel a lack of support and lack of empathy from the community and some have said really cynical things like, ""Nothing's going to happen until a school board member dies,"" or ""They won't care until it's one of our star athletes whose lungs are ruined.""

It’s always good to meet your opponents’ chief argument and then you might see it’s not all bad faith on the other side.

As for the states, namely Tennessee where I’m from, it’s very difficult for parents. My granddaughter had a slight cold with a cough so instead of sending her to school my son took her, as he should, for a Covid test. Meanwhile her brother also necessarily needed to stay out of school while they were waiting on the results (which were negative)￼. Somehow word got around that she was being tested for Covid. She was shamed when she returned, no fever, no covid, no runny nose, only a little tickle in her throat that made her cough. She’s in 2nd grade. So, my son missed a day of work to stay out with the kids (his wife is an art teacher). ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼It seems that instead of empathy and understanding for one another - we are really all in this together,￼ people jump in and out of strong emotion depending on their situation. If you or your kids had a cold, what would you do? Not everyone can stay home from work, my son is lucky in that – and what about so many who don’t have this option? Who will keep the kids while waiting on results?￼ Last year in the US￼ I was in the classroom a couple of times and saw masks on chins, on desks,￼ and kids throwing them on the playground then picking them up before they went inside. What to do? Let’s think."
2021-09-23 14:35:45,"At what point did the demands/beliefs of the individual take precedence over the well-being of the larger community?
We have mandated vaccines for Polio, Tetanus, MMR, Smallpox, etc. as a requirement to attend public schools. Why is/should a vaccine/mask mandate be any different?

As a child growing up in Nassau County on Long Island in the 1960’s, I recall that even though I went to the
Catholic school in the local parish, I received the polio vaccine by standing in line at the local public school. I assume my mother had to provide our address. What I do recall was that many years later my mother conveyed to me how grateful she and other parents were at the time to have finally been able to protect their children from polio, which has been a scourge for so long… nobody had friends or family who had been untouched.
We must respect the views of parents who do not wish their children to wear masks BUT since masks are a proven deterrent to the spread of Covid, those parents must understand that their children cannot attend classes and will have to learn on-line."
2021-09-23 14:36:35,"I read this differently. What about the rights of students with disabilities (speech/language/hearing) to appropriate education, for whom masks make it impossible to learn? 

The (close to zero) risks of Covid for this age group, as well as the (close to zero) benefits of cloth masks make a school mask mandate policy nothing but safety theater driven by hysteria, while other kids with language and hearing disabilities are being tangibly harmed. That is the real dystopia we are living in."
2021-09-23 13:49:55,"As an infectious diseases physician the politicization of common sense public health measures has been one of the most frustrating aspects of this pandemic. Until we have this under control wash hands, wear a mask and get a shot is all that is needed. New England by having very high immunization rates and general compliance with masking and other science driven measures, has entered  a new phase of the pandemic where despite many cases in the community the hospitalization and death rates are very very low. Things are moving more towards normalcy. I find it unfathomable that every governor would not want this for their constituents.

In terms of school masks they work to reduce spread in the school and spill over spread into households. The data on this are very clear. And the myth that kids don't get sick is simply not true. Yes the rate of severe illness is much less than elderly. But many kids do end up in the hospital and a small number die. Just look at the children's hospitals in the southern states who have had many pediatric covid hospitalizations. Obviously masking in school should be a stop gap measure until immunization is widely available to children--there is bright light at the end of that tunnel. 

If only we could change the discussion from what is my personal rights to what will end this pandemic as quickly as possible for all of us."

A society based on individualism and individual rights is destined to fail."
2021-09-23 13:25:43,"This article is written as though kids inconsistently wearing paper and t-shirt cloth masks under mandate create some sort of sterile environment for at-risk kids.  They don't.  They may reduce transmission somewhat but kids who are at serious risk of infection (like my daughter was for the first year of COVID while having chemo) need their own, real protection in the form of their own N95 masks or respiratory protection. We are so entrenched in masks as a symbolic culture war that we are not able to think clearly about various settings and populations and what makes sense in each.  Yes, masks make a lot of sense in crowded places where we encounter lots of strangers, especially when hospitals are full.  No, masks aren't going to turn a classroom into an isolation room for sick kids and in fact may make their risk higher if people wearing substandard masks take more risks because they think the mask is going to protect them."
2021-09-23 14:36:17,"Welcome to the south. I live in Edmonson County, Kentucky. We've had a mask mandate here. But the Principle of one of our elementary schools has decided that her mesh mask meets the definition of ""mask"" and so that's what she wears to work every day. With our kids that are too young to even get vaccinated. I just don't understand what someone who obviously does not care about our children's health and education is doing in a leadership role, in charge of our children's education and safety while they're at school. But this is the rural south. Public positions here are achieved by WHO you know, not what. So to take this to the school board and get the principle written up for insubordination, a person must have photographic proof. But inside a public school is considered private property and is rightly difficult to gain access to. So, almost impossible for an appalled and concerned parent to get photographic proof. I'm worried and frustrated by the obvious selfishness and ignorance displayed by the principle of an elementary school."
2021-09-23 13:45:48,"Important article. As this paper has documented so well, the schools where there is good ventilation, desks spread apart 6 feet, and mask mandates, they have been very good at slowing transmission. My county, which includes the huge city of San Jose, is down to just 11 people per 100,000 testing positive, and our school district has had zeros cases! That compares to over 90  per 100,000 testing positive in Tennessee, and kids coming home with it. Now that they are about to open up the vaccine to kids,
I think I can finally see the day when we can send them back without masking. Maybe after the holidays! Meanwhile, Tennessee will be dealing with this thing for another year plus. Who is more “free” then? Certainly not these good families of children living with disabilities, trying to do their part. Shame on the rest."

Tennessee has some of the highest rates of COVID cases and deaths in the county, yet Lee only cares about amassing a huge rainy day fund, turning away expanded Federal unemployment support to encourage people to take minimum-wage jobs, and signing a permit less carry bill into law.

2021-09-23 13:49:32,"Frankly, most parents wouldn't pack a loaded gun into their kids lunchbox, but think nothing of packing off to school a kid potentially loaded with COVID mask less.  My daughter who teaches was exposed to a kid with the Delta variant.  Days later she got sick and had to stay home and isolate.  Thankfully a COVID test was negative.  When asked, she said parents routinely send their kids to school with minor fevers and sniffles (most likely because employers stingily dole out sick leave if at all).  Masking reflects the tensions in a society that more frequently eschews collective health and welfare --  a commonwealth -- for notions of individualism and freedom without any restraint.

2021-09-23 13:53:11,"I think when you boil it down, Americans in general  really don’t care about other people.

So I’ll make my kids’ education decisions, my 401K decisions, my healthcare decisions, my vaccine decisions, my personal protection decisions.  America is a one man country.  I hope we see through Covid that this is an impossible burden.  One person can’t be an expert in so many things.  Now everyone is an epidemiologist?  

As a response to this self reliance, many Americans are asking for less government.  Which is the opposite of what they should be asking.  We should be asking for BETTER government instead and reorganize to work not as individuals but as groups.  If you believe in evolution then humans got to where they are today by working in groups, alone we got eaten by beasts.  If you believe in God, then God didn’t just make Adam and called it good.

This is why I stopped teaching in K-12 and have no plans of ever going back to K-12 though I am a fully certified, highly qualified educator. Parents of children with disabilities *should* be worried about their kids because the ugly truth is that schools are often led by administrators who have no respect for special education. I worked for a principal, we’ll call him “Dumb Don,” who bragged to teachers about “getting away with” never implementing accommodations and modifications for special education students while he was (briefly) a teacher. So of course he did not understand or care about the needs of the special education department. Why did he become a principal? Because becoming a principal is far too easy! They just need warm bodies, and most schools prefer white male warm bodies. 

I would remind parents of special education students that federal law is on their side, that schools are REQUIRED to provide accommodations and modifications by law, regardless of how incompetent their principal happens to be, and that they should file lawsuits left and right to keep their kids safe! Trust me, the teachers are upset about it too and so many times, their hands are tied due to the ignorant decisions made by school boards and school administration."

2021-09-23 15:41:09,"I keep saying it: Thankful to live in CA. Doubly thankful that my young grand nephews do too! BTW, anti mask parents, the boys, 7 and 11 years, have been masking up in public for oh, 18 months now. No ""harmful effects"". Including the one who has ADD and high functioning autism."
2021-09-23 15:43:56,"I live in Santa Monica, California, and my elderly parents live in Raleigh, NC. I have been back home three times in the last two months. It was astonishing to me to be in grocery stores or Starbucks with people not wearing masks. They smile and say “Have a Blessed Day,” yet they are putting my life in danger. I don’t understand how they claim to love their neighbors while basically at the same time possibly killing them."
2021-09-23 15:43:23,"What troubles me is the negative impact this has on the kids in these areas of the south. Not only are they put at risk for getting COVID, but the sight of their parents arguing against science encourages a whole generation of non-believers. Couple that with the home-school mentality for religious reasons, these young minds are doomed. Hopefully, as they grow someone will help them see the light past the misguided parenting."
2021-09-23 15:37:09,"I had the opposite true for my family and many of our friends in the special needs community. The mask mandate proved difficult for children who are unable to keep their masks on or wear them correctly. My child is nonverbal and we had to file complaints to remedy the situation. It took months.

As a vaccinated person I’m tired of mask mandate (anti science) folks that want to force them on people who are vaxed. I’m tired of watching award shows, the Met Gala and big city mayors ignore their own mandates. I can’t stand anti vax anti masks people who would rather spread germs and harm people than get a simple shot."
2021-09-23 15:41:12,School choice vouchers would resolve the conflict.  I think parents would accept public school mask mandates if they could opt out and send children to private schools aligned with their worldview.
2021-09-23 16:42:19,"I'm interested to hear from an attorney with expertise in ADA/504/IDEA on the merits, as its investigation seems to be kind of a novel use of the federal educational civil rights statutes. OCR seems to be implying the law demands more than an individual accommodation for individual students (the familiar IDEA/ADA approach), and instead a blanket state-level policy that all students must follow to protect particular students with particular disabilities. Would OCR have to demonstrate the evidentiary merits of the heightened risk from covid disability-by-disability? And then would only schools that educate children with that disability be required by federal civil rights law to mandate masks for their student population? And just the classmates of the affected student with the higher-risk disability? Additionally, might there be other disabled children who can only access a free appropriate public education if they are granted a mask exemption due to a cognitive or communication disability? And how will this play out in the future for kids whose disability puts them at greater medical risk from the flu or RSV in future respiratory viral seasons? I'm fascinated to watch this unfold, and I would love to hear a more expert attorney explain the merits of this investigation."
2021-09-23 15:50:29,"If I can refrain from sending my child to school with a peanut-butter sandwich to protect your child, you can send yours to school with a mask to protect my child.  The inconvenience is about the same."
2021-09-23 16:17:24,I'm grateful that I do not personally have children in school and have to face the tough decision to send my child to a school where masks are not mandatory. When the pandemic is over and we look back at America's response to the pandemic we will have to hang our heads in shame. Just how many people will have died as a result of politics and selfishness but I doubt that the anti-vaxxer anti-maskers will feel one once of remorse but there will be fewer of them around.
2021-09-23 16:51:42,"We have a similar situation in another suburb of a Southern city with a similar demographic to Franklin, TN. One of our children is in a special needs class full-time. The school started without a mask mandate, adopted one for a couple of weeks, and then dropped it again. Every other district in the metro area has a mask mandate, as do most of the districts in the state. Fortunately, we were able to get our child full vaccinated when adolescents were approved and the teacher and aides in the special needs class are still wearing masks. The students generally are not because they won’t keep them on. That applies to our child as well. I would feel better if the school had a mandate, but between the vaccine, separation from the rest of the school (including for lunch due to COVID), and the students and aides being masked, we have with some concerns decided to keep our child in school.

If the schools weren’t some of the best in the state in general and for special needs, we’d consider moving to a different district. We are very disappointed in the vocal minority who have brow beaten the school board to cave to their demands to defy science and reject shared community sacrifice for the good of all."
2021-09-23 15:55:35,"I see our little grandchildren wear them easily and without any difficulty. Our children moved out of Tennessee to a safer northern community. Smart, educated parents prepare their children for this ongoing and dangerous pandemic. Organized playtime with children that have same minded parents will keep them from being “traumatized”."
2021-09-23 16:01:45,"Freedom? What a weak argument. The same people who are arguing for their personal choices should think about all the freedoms they give up when they buckle a seatbelt, place their children in car seats, stop at traffics lights, register their cars, and more. Do they understand what happens when this country goes to war and has a draft of young people? Do they understand that people who want to be doctors, electricians lawyers, nurses, teachers, plumbers, counselors aren’t free to just practice those professions? There are laws governing those professions. Do they think they are free to just build a house? There are construction laws. Do they think they are free to take food out of a grocery store without paying? Not only does the store have rules but local laws cover that action. Do they think they are free to blare loud music and run around their neighborhood screaming? No. There are noise ordinances. Some communities tell you what your fence has to look like, the colors you can paint your home and the kind of mailbox you put up. 
When you live in a civil society their are rules and laws everyone must adhere to for that society to work. People work together for the betterment of society. We agree to do things even when we don’t want to do them. Freedom has never meant you can do whatever you want to do. Yes, you have the freedom not to follow society but there are consequences for that. 
Freedom doesn’t mean you can sicken children, the elderly, the disabled, the vulnerable."
2021-09-23 15:47:42,"What's sadly apparent is that ""pro-life"" Republicans care intensely about the disabled only while they're in the womb.

These ""Christians"" have lost all of their moral authority. All of it."
2021-09-23 16:55:16,"To the parents of toddlers who gladly wear masks - how do you do it? 

I have a 2.5 yr old, who attends school where masks are required for 3yo and above. 

We put a mask on her when we go places, because we are worried about her catching the virus and because we want to be respectful of other people’s health. Her dad and I wear masks all the time when leaving the house. 

If she puts it on, she won’t keep it on longer than 15 minutes. We put it in again, same thing happens. In a public place, if there’s tears and tantrums about the mask, which there often are, we remove her and basically take her home to play in the yard. 

I’m starting to think that after she can get the vaccine, she should be able to go maskless in public places, or… other people are better parents with better behaved children."
2021-09-23 16:56:42,"Three of the five documents that Leigh-Allyn Baker cited as ""guarantee[ing her] freedom"" don't guarantee anyone anything.

2021-09-23 17:33:03,"I live in TN with a governor who doesn't know what he is talking about much of the time. When did facts, including scientific facts become up for debate? Opinions are one things, facts are another. Children who can't be vaccinated yet need to be protected - by adults around them (family and teachers) who are vaxxed and by masks and some distancing. Simple. Do it. Save a life. Stop thinking it's about choice. It's about the public good."
2021-09-23 17:39:30,"Based on an ""unscientific study"" - a conversation with my son - most kids don't really care that much about the mask requirements or the vaccines, they just want to be in school together again.  The pressure on the kids is coming from their anti-mask/vax parents who want them to toe the Red party line."

Now that N95/KF94/etc high-filtration masks are widely available, I don't understand why people at high risk can't just wear their own highly-protective masks, and stop worrying about what others are doing. ""My mask protects me"" is all that is needed today."

Everyone had masks on except for the couple minutes or so per photo. 

And the staff told me that they have no issues at all getting the kids to wear masks. ""They're better than most adults,"" I was told.

And these are kids that can't talk, have debilitating autism, or other various issues. No complaints, no problems, they wear masks and get on with the day like it isn't a big deal. Which it should not be."

2021-09-23 18:08:30,"A story,
If you were the unvaccinated parent of a child with a food allergy perhaps to peanuts and you informed the teacher of this as well as called all of the parents of  the children in your child's class and let them know about your child's allergy that could result is serious illness or death if your child was exposed to any food containing peanuts. Suppose again that one of the parents  told you that their child loved peanut butter and it was their ""constitutional right"" and freedom to give their child food containing peanuts and they really did not care what happened to your child. Their right supersedes your child's well being even if it means your child's death.   

Think about it."
2021-09-23 18:10:36,"We were told that once fully vaccinated we did not need to wear masks.  I did it and Im done.  The pandemic may not be done, but I am done with the pandemic.

There is only one type of mask that is effective:  N95

All other masks are useless, including the Chinese standard K95.

An N95, by definition, stops 95% (not 100%) of particulates.  Actually, for the 100 nanometer diameter of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the mask has been show to be closer to 99%.

2021-09-23 18:25:11,"I think this generation of parents is going to be like the depression era; who hoarded   food long after it was necessary. It will be hard to get  parents to feel ‘ safe ’ Again without masks.  Not sure what it would take, and no sarcastic replies needed. ‘ zero covid ‘  is  not happening. We must learn to live with it and accept some risk, and no, mask wearing the rest of life is not reasonable ."
2021-09-23 19:49:37,"What would the Silent Generation (those who went through the Great Depression) say, what would the Greatest Generation (those who fought and won WWII) say if told about these parents and these communities?  That they cannot even wear a mask to protect the most vulnerable in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed over 600k Americans?

I'm guessing they would ask:  what ever happened to looking out for your neighbor?  For sacrificing for the common good of the community?  If you're not even willing to take the simplest step to save a life, how are you not the most selfish generation?  When did such selfishness, such narcissism and self-aggrandizement become the epitomy of virtue?

2021-09-23 17:53:27,"By the way and despite all the lying, the fact of the matter is that a lot of European schoolkids do indeedy wear masks to school this fall: France, for example, mandates it.

Other countries work things differently, especially for very young kids: England, for example, relies more on a LOT of testing and quarantining. 

And if were were to say, okay, K-4 kids are pretty young to handle masks, so we’ll keep the windows open, crank the air, test&isolate as needed—it’s a safe bet that the same yahoos who’re screaming about masking would still refuse vaccines, and scream about how little Jimmy wasn’t a-gonna do no tyrannocal gub’mint tests and you better close them windows.

And then the rest of the article argues we should keep doing the same NPI that didn’t work? Cognitive dissonance much? 

As a parent of a special needs kid, I thought the article would be about the struggle to have them WEAR masks for 6 hours a day. I have a hard time with that."
2021-09-23 23:19:34,"In the 60s/70s, the protests were about how the government was drafting young men to put them in harm's way in Vietnam. Now, the protesters oppose the government, or in this case the school board, for trying to keep people safe. 

The article mentions how some pastors are telling people to believe in God rather than masks. Part of the tension here is that science eats away at the purview some would like to reserve for God. And if people look to government and science for answers, the pastors get worried that people will stop looking to God. Why not say that science is a way of understanding how God works? The saying, ""God helps those who help themselves,"" can be extended to ""God helps nations that help themselves."" In this way, God can be thought of as being on the side of those who use science and good government to deal with threats like the pandemic and human-caused climate change. But then, the pastors might lose some of their parishioners.

It is the pastors, then, who are controlled by fear and self-interest--a fear of losing audience if people see that science and government can help solve problems. 

I think, too, that some people--pastors, conservative radio and TV personalities--need an enemy to hold their audience. For them, the idea of working together to solve problems using the best available methods poses, in fact, a threat to their livelihoods. The polarization we are experiencing is artificial--manufactured to sustain audience and a failed ideology."
2021-09-23 23:48:00,The solution to this is fairly straightforward.  Stop sending your children to school where they refuse to follow best medical advise and require masking and vaccination.  Most of the non complinant schools are in red states who don't care about education and only teach what the most conservative pastor approves.  Since the schools in those areas don't really teach anything if you keep the kids home and fairly safe the school district looses a lot of funding

I am a believer in masks and science. I have truly come to appreciate, if not love , my mask for what it has done. 

It is really hard to teach phonemes with a mask on. It is hard to be heard with a mask on. It is sad that when my students take it off outside I don’t recognize them because I only know the top half of their face. All of our males get wet and need changed throughout the day. It is necessary, and we do it but we look forward to the day we don’t need to do this. When this is no longer a pandemic, mask use needs to be entirely optional. Yes some Asian countries wear them all the time. We celebrate our  differences and that’s what makes us unique. Perhaps some want to live in a country where it is a cultural norm to wear them all the time? I cannot wait to get back to not wearing them and seeing my students full beautiful  faces when this is no longer a pandemic.

However- there have been times when that hasn't been the case. I use a sharpie to write a Big letter on the top to help me. But for those with multiple prescriptions or similar pills?  Yeah- it's a real issue.

2021-09-20 21:15:44,"Nothing about the land border with Canada, eh?

There are over 100 border crossings between the US and Canada, and there were 95 million crossings by individuals in both directions in 2019, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics -- excluding train travelers and commercial transport vehicles.

Only people traveling from the US to Canada have been able to make the crossing since August 9; Canadians, who are overall better vaccinated as a percentage of population, still can't cross into the US and don't know when they'll be able to.

We assume the Biden administration is more worried about unvaccinated people coming over the southern border with Mexico and doesn't feel it can show favour to Canada, as the three countries are bound by the sensitive USMCA trade agreement.

Fair enough, but given how many Canadians visit the US (and spend lots of money there) and that we've had one of the world's most open borders, the Times could at least spend a sentence or two on it. After all, it published a snarky op-ed by one of its own editorial board members in early summer complaining  about Canada keeping him away from his Canadian summer cottage. If you let us in again, we promise not to track any snow across the border. Honest."
2021-09-20 21:17:10,"This move by the Biden administration is far past overdue, and welcome.  The ongoing extensions of it were absolutely maddening in their pointlessness and insipidness, and a sort of nationalistic selfishness (we could go there, but they couldn't come here).

A vaccinated international visitor with a negative COVID test presents far, far, far less of a danger to our country than some unvaccinated dude on a domestic flight.

It would be nice to know what the plan is for reopening our northern land border to Canadian visitors, thereby reciprocating Canada's opening of its land border in early August.  Because the status quo is that Canadians can fly to the U.S., but not drive to the U.S., and apparently that's ""science"".

And I remain baffled as to why we can't open all countries to inbound travel for passengers who are vaccinated and can show a negative COVID test.  Eligibility should be based on the person, not on the country."

2021-09-20 21:25:27,"The vaccinated are this month's red herring because we assume they cannot  be infected or transmit.  They can!

Frequent, reliable testing, contact tracing / quarantining and masking are a surer way to tamp down infections.

In Massachusetts, breakthrough infections (BTI's) on September 7th were 0.53% and a week later it was 0.61% of the total number of 4.5 million vaccinated residents.  

Since July 31st –– when the Delta variant became fully dominant, the rate of increase (r.o.i.) for BTI’s as a percent of the vaccinated has ranged btw 20% and 26%, the lone aberration coming last week when the r.o.i. was 15%.

<a href=""https://tinyurl.com/2jyc34p4"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/2jyc34p4</a>

For the  following calculations, I used the formula F = P (1.0 + r)^t      Present percent = 0.61%; r = .22; t = number of weeks and F = future infections.

In 15 weeks from 9-14-2021 to 12-28-2021, the percent of vaccinated individuals with BTI’s will have increased from 0.61% to 12% if r.o.i. remains at 22% and the number of vaccinated does not increase tremendously.

In an additional 10 weeks –– 12-28-2021 thru March 8, all things remaining the same, the percent of  vaccinated individuals with BTI’s will have increased from 12% to 87%.

On the Ides of March, the percent of  vaccinated individuals with BTI’s will have increased from 87% to 107%, or every vaccinated person in MA, if lackadaisical human behavior remains constant and state and local governments do not impose restrictions. 

The vaccinated must also be tested."

2021-09-20 21:27:04,"Unfortunately it is the same in the US as over here and many other countries. Most people do not even think about children and families. 

The only country (I know of right now) where they find responsible and good rules for children and families is Austria and it is still easy to feel safe there."

2021-09-20 21:41:33,About time.  It is only fair that the vaccinated stop having all aspects of their lives held back by those who won’t.  And as to all the comments that suggest banning domestic flights to the unvaccinated I agree.
2021-09-20 21:31:41,What about children who are too young for vaccination? Still banned?
2021-09-20 21:45:15,"If someone in the Biden Administration had used Google, they would know that the US has been a no-go zone for almost all member states of the EU for roughly the last five weeks.  Also, vacations to other continents generally take time to plan, so even after this ban is lifted, there may not be great demand for travel to North America because summer break is over and the weather is turning cooler.  But the Biden Administration need not worry as this is the kind of thing 5th graders have no trouble figuring out."

2021-09-20 21:50:30,"Bringing Covid/Delta Virus to USA?
It’s much more likely that Europeans catch the virus here (eg Florida) and bring it home to Europe. 
We need the same rules here on domestic flights."
2021-09-20 21:54:03,Note that Unvaccinated Americans will be able to fly back with a negative test day prior to flight. This does not exclude infection. Ideally this group should be physically isolated from other travellers. At least the vaccinated should be warned …
2021-09-20 21:59:58,This is greta news and I am thankful for it. I am an American resident in South Korea and have been fully vaccinated since early summer. Those vaccinated in Korea are not subject to quarantine upon returning to this country. However those vaccinated in the US with the same vaccines used in Korea aree forced to endure 14 days of quarantine even after having a negative test upon arrival. With President Moon in NY now (not subject to quarantine) can someone make him understand the blatant unfairness of this?

2021-09-20 22:15:14,The article says foreign travelers will need to show proof of jabs but unvaccinated Americans will not. The latter will only have stricter testing requirements? So wrong! What makes us believe that whatever contract tracing system we set up for unvaccinated Americans will work and that the required email and phone numbers will be real. We're going to have more unvaccinated people running around JFK and other international arrival points? Good luck controlling this epidemic. No un-jabbed people should be allowed into the US period.
2021-09-20 22:22:47,"Overdue and should be extended to domestic flights with no ""out"" for testing negative. This should NOT be couched as a vaccination mandate. It IS a travel safety mandate with little difference from those for seatbelts, firearms and similar air travel requirements."

Although all of them are vaccinated, they were not allowed to come to US.  
Closed or restricted borders have proven to be permeable by viruses, over and over again.  
Closed borders affect and separate families. Borders should not be closed lightly.  Our oldest family members remember the Iron Curtain and the Soviet bloc isolation."

2. Canadian travelers *flying* in for non-essential purposes with proof of vaccination and a negative COVID test = OK
3. Canadian travelers *driving* in or taking *ferry* for non-essential purposes with proof of vaccination and a negative COVID test = No Way

The present situation is at least one control the US has over Mexican ingress, and Canadians are penalized because of it. What a great way to treat your closest ally."
2021-09-20 22:43:50,Great. But now we need a travel ban for unvaccinated Americans. I'm not flying until that happens. Two trips to NY and I was nervous the whole time.

2021-09-20 22:52:29,"Very sad that the border between Canada and the U.S. remains closed. As a fully vaccinated Canadian, it is a slap in the face that we cannot drive across, even though our vaccinated American friends have that opportunity. I used to cross the border several times a month…for shopping, sightseeing and visiting. Disappointed for sure."
2021-09-20 23:01:20,"Is there any information on exactly when these new rules become effective? Something more specific than ""early November?"" November 1?"
2021-09-20 23:01:23,"Finally...had heard that Biden was rejecting this move...then I would be very disappointed in someone I trusted to get America out of the nasty era of Trump, which sadly seems to continue, by the same crowd who dislike being vaccinated as well.  It is time to realize that many from these countries unlike many Americans do not reject Science or Vaccination, and frankly their ridiculous reasons are hampering us all.  A Doctor recently said ""100,000 have died from this in America thanks to their denial, and the total dead are more than in 1918, when people died because there was no vaccine.  More and more I blame the parents who have led their children to believe it is their ""right to be so self-centered."""

Canadians should be happy to be out of this limelight, however, given that their incidence of COVID on a population adjusted basis is about one-third that of the US and the rate of fully vaccinated eligible people is now in the range of 80%, while the US remains in the high 50s. It is almost a blessing in disguise to continue being the butt of restrictions."
2021-09-20 23:15:43,"Someone, please explain why the same set of restrictions should not apply to land border crossings as do for air travel? Is the Covid virus afraid to fly or something? 

Seriously, how are greater restrictions for travel by car, train, or bus over air travel justifiable?"
2021-09-20 23:28:50,"I agree it's time to open up to vaccinated and tested travelers. Let's hope implementing this goes smoothy. My employer, a large company with a multinational workforce is now implementing a vaccination requirement to return to work. Internal discussions reveal a long list of problems, including some having technical difficulties with the apps used to register, people who got their vaccination in other countries, poorly or incompletely filled out CDC cards, some with stickers covering information, people who lost their cards (my state doesn't issue replacements), but have other records from a pharmacy or other vaccinator, people who volunteered to be early vaccine test subjects, slow response by the verification service,  etc. My company rejected many CDC cards for not having the date of birth filled in, but didn't make clear this was why. Other travel documents, such as airline ticket and passport require an exact name match, but my CDC card doesn't have my middle name. This exact match requirement has already been a problem for travelers coming from countries whose alphabets contain more than the 26 in English, and whose name may have been anglicized to the English alphabet on some documents. Are we going to accept proof where the name doesn't match exactly? So far there's no internationally accepted proof of vaccination, so we'll likely have to deal with all sorts of different records from other countries. At least Europe has pretty much standardized their Green Pass."
2021-09-20 23:29:15,"Yet more staggering ineptitude.  

Do government officials actually believe that ‘vaccine cards’ can’t be faked and forged?  There are likely a multitude of shops now specializing in ‘Vaccine Cards for US Customs’. 

How did COVID get here in the first place?  International travelers. Bingo!

Great news for the American citizenry: more COVID coming our way."

I am a home owner in Florida and I pay property taxes there, as well as employ a property manager to look after my home and pay on going services for my home there. My American friends could come to Canada to visit their second properties as of Aug 9. Why can’t I drive across the border to visit my property? Because Biden wants to look tough and if he opens the northern border he would have to open the southern border with Mexico, and Republicans would say he is soft on border control. Yet many of those very same Republicans own luxury properties in Canada.

Barring China, when the proven vaccines of ASTRA ZENICA  by Oxford university (Covishield in India) & messenger-RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna are available for Americans abroad, the reason for travelling to USA as the unvaccinated is a subject of interest in our battle against Covid.

How will the government track and follow up to ensure the post-entry test is completed and valid?

If the purpose is to promote the growth of our economy, to pass legislation that will flow $trillions to promote the ""social safety net"" why go to such extremes to enforce wearing masks, requiring vaccinations, promoting taking the booster shot, and rushing to offer a vaccine to our kids 5+ years old. I think Biden's pandemic policy should be called ""we want our cake and eat it too."" I say we should spend our time creating a national pandemic policy all states will follow, is clear to all our citizens.

Can understand a 'lose 'of $500 billion of an anticipation of earnings, but expenditures?

 How much have they received from the Care Act and subsequent aid?

India knows why but doesn't understand why they cannot increase production to give to poorer countries and other in dire need of vaccinations. They say it's because of contracts the bigger companies like J&J own and won't allow it to happen, similar to like patent rights for say Pfizer Moderna.

A family member just took a cross-country flight.  The woman in the opposite aisle seat said to a traveling companion something like ""the flight attendant isn't going to be happy with me because I'm not going to wear my mask.""

When my family member asked the woman to wear the mask, she pulled it up to cover her mouth, but not her nose.

This is utter nonsense.  

The people who refuse to comply with the mask rule are likely to be the people who refuse to get vaccinated.

The 1918 pandemic was an influenze pandemic and just fizzled out by itself.
This isn't influenza and is a virus that seems to be evolving into other variants like Delta and can be passed on even though vaccinated and therefore shows us that this contagion is just going to keep on circulating in society forever because there is no better vaccine to stop it from spreading. 
All those people who don't wear masks and won't get vaccinated will eventually get it and it will kill them as they age, if a better vaccine is not invented. 
I blame Trump for this situation as he said it was just another flu. No way is it like an influenza as it's a contagion that is evolving."
2021-09-21 04:31:33,"Unless 90% of the worlds whole population gets vaccinated this parasitic virus is going to keep spreading and causing hospital systems to collapse world wide. This virus can spread even if you're vaccinated and will keep spreading as long as it has a host to latch onto. Wear your masks because the more people travelling worldwide the more chance it has of spreading.
I honestly don't know how we are going to cope psychologically in NZ when we open our borders and all the people with fake vaccination certificates travel here and cause our hospital system to collapse. The rest of the world has been living with covid-19 and we have not. Most of our population would be freaked out if we get an outbreak of covid in the community.
These are strange times!"
2021-09-21 09:55:17,I cancelled a recent trip abroad because of the mandatory testing required of fully vaccinated Americans 3 days before returning home that is required by our own government. A friend was forced to quarantine abroad and had to extend a trip for 3 weeks a great expense until testing results for her family all cleared. Are foreign visitors who are fully vaccinated exempt from this requirement or will we be changing it for Americans so that vaccinated US citizens are treated equally?
2021-09-21 10:33:06,"It's right that universal air travel should resume ​- but at a price high enough to ensure that volumes don't return to previous levels and with the clear proviso that tighter restrictions might be re-imposed.

Long distance flights are the perfect environment for aerosol virus transmission and if long haul flights had not been so common, or if effective restrictions had been imposed in good time, we might well have avoided the delta variant ever occurring in the first place. In fact there might not have been a global pandemic.

In the future, a levy on long haul air travel should be imposed to fund a completely upgraded and reconstituted World Health Organisation 2.0 and help redress the CO2 release to which aviation is also such a major contributor."
2021-09-21 10:47:57,"Great, now that the US has a high incidence, that despite that there are no mask mandates in most places, we will be allowed in when temperatures will be low and outdoor dining no longer an option. 
I had plans to visit my son in DC in September and had to cancel those,  but since he was able to visit me in Paris in June because he has dual citizenship, I will wait till I'm eligible for a booster shot and the numbers go down in the States before traveling there.
I'm very happy though for all the people who haven't had a chance to see their family in eighteen months.

Daughter marries on October 3rd in Mary Esther FL (to her American fiancé) and my wife and me will not be able to attend the wedding!
Frankly speaking we found this at least humiliating as a treatment from a country we consider(ed?) as sister.

The substantial ban to all visitors/immigrants etc etc affected also the K1 Visa process.
Process started in November 2019 and our daughter has been interviewed only in April 2021 just because we “forced” the procedure asking the National Interest Exception (she is a MD, working also in Covid hospitals) that was granted in 36 hours after request and K1 was granted in 48 hrs after interview which means things could have been done much earlier bur were preposterously delayed for no substantial reason.
Still the real reason of such a long lasting ban is not clear; people coming from most of the other countries in the world, with much worse Covid situations than Italy/Europe, were allowed to enter; not to mention that just staying 14 days e.g. in Mexico you could just get in the US with no problem.
Sorry to say but this was and is a bad way to treat people coming from countries not only “allied” but also with a much better vaccination situation. 
Just one daughter, one wedding and we maybe will be able to watch on a Zoom meeting….what should we say?"

2021-09-21 08:01:33,In other words: families with kids under the age of 12 are still not allowed to travel to the U.S. Thank you so much!
2021-09-21 07:56:13,"I wonder if Americans will be indignant when other countries label the US an extreme risk, to be avoided except for necessary travel."
2021-09-21 10:06:43,I am fully vaccinated and frustrated with those who are not but I now know 4 people who were also fully vaccinated that have gotten covid.  The vaccines are not perfect.  Would like to know if people with antibodies are better off.
2021-09-21 10:11:46,"Knowing that NYC now requires proof of vaccination to eat in restaurants, I hope de Blasio will work to educate front of house workers on the fact that Europeans have QR code’s on their phones (very difficult to forge, despite some of the hysteria of commentators below), so this form of proof can be recognized when they are asked to show proof of vaccination to have a meal.   I just returned from a couple of months in Europe, my CDC card was thankfully accepted everywhere, almost everytime people checking for the second shot. I hope we have a similar plan in place to welcome visitors back to NYC."
2021-09-21 04:17:05,"If we’re going to open football stadiums to unvaccinated Americans, why not welcome fully vaxxed foreigners? Penn State’s Beaver stadium had 110,000 people crammed into it on Saturday. I thought you “Yankees” were supposed or have sense."
2021-09-21 08:01:17,"""The U.S. lifts its travel ban on unvaccinated visitors""
Huh?"
2021-09-21 05:36:43,"I voted for Biden because there was no alternative and I truly believed that he would restore some sanity to foreign policy and the handling of the cornavirus crisis. I am deeply disappointed One failed foreign policy blunder after another; alienating historic allies like France; dirty dealing with the Australians over submarine contracts; barring Europeans from the US, when they have gotten their numbers under control. Letting in others who have not.  Incoherent, incompetent and stupid. No longer a supporter of Biden and the arrogant (blip, blip) Blinken, whom he has put in charge of foreign policy. I am ashamed of this president and vice president and ashamed that I voted for them.  Republicans are out of the question of course, but I despair.  Whst is Biden going to say at the UN tomorrow. The whole world should laugh derisively, as the did at Trump. At this point, I don't see much difference between them in foreign policy. USA uber alles."
2021-09-21 11:37:54,This decision should have been delayed until the U.S. has more people vaccinated. Will this become yet another example of premature decision-making by our government?
2021-09-21 11:51:59,"Agreeing with Dr Scott Gottlieb, border containment is relatively ineffective in the era of delta variant. However, making foreign visitors show vaccination status is far more beneficial globally. A win-win strategy!"
2021-09-21 12:32:49,"We welcome every vaccinated person who wants to come to the US, to visit especially here in NYC. We've missed you! And, while you might be tempted to fly around and see the rest of the country while you're here, be warned that you fly within this country at your own risk until we also put in place a vaccine mandate for domestic flights. Why doesn't this happen?"
2021-09-21 12:04:15,"It is terrible that the land border is not being opened. Money always wins and I guess they don't make enough off those driving in? This is hurting border states, and people with properties in the US who want to drive there. Rather than be able to go alone, in a car, and not have any Covid exposure people now have to spend hours in airports, on a plane with others and probably rent a car to see family and friends, the cost is prohibitive to many. COME ON! This is a terrible carryover of trying to keep illegal immigrants at bay, stop mascarading it as a ""health precaution"" because it makes absolutely no sense scientifically. Make them be tested, make them be vaccinated, just let them in like you are the rest of the world!"
2021-09-21 11:54:27,"Because so many people in the United States remain unvaccinated, why is that rapid testing is not available here? Is it, as usual, about money? The pharmaceutical industry needs to do the right thing: step forward and make testing absolutely free. But will they? Of course not. They'd turn to their Republican minders in Congress to prevent such a travesty."
2021-09-21 13:19:40,"Mr. Willie Walsh of the IATA is correct. Testing should focus only on the unvaccinated. It is beyond absurd to require a negative Covid test for the fully vaccinated. The risk of being a “carrier” is minimal, and the risk to vaccinated Americans is even lower. Vaccination should be the goal. Testing should be the punishment for those who refuse. In rare cases of true medical reasons for not being vaccinated, testing is an unfortunate but necessary evil."
2021-09-21 13:20:33,Finally ! Great news! I don’t see a date yet? What is early job? Nov 1 or Nov 10? Any pointers
2021-09-21 13:53:23,"Good news, but too late for some! None of our European relatives and friends could come for my daughter's wedding this summer.

There is one popular misconception that should be corrected though, among authorities, public, and media. The impression one receives is that when the number of infectious people is down it is okay to resume normal contacts. An epidemic is driven by the reproduction factor of the virus; the reproduction factor is determined by the number of contacts, and their intensity which is affected mainly by  time and social distancing (much less by other environmental factors). Thus, even when the number of infectious people is down, the factors listed above need to be kept in check. Travel will not affect them."
2021-09-21 13:55:28,I may have missed this in my several readings of this article but what about vaccinated Americans? Do they have to get tested 3 days before or one day before leaving?
2021-09-21 15:19:41,"It's about time. In fact, it's past time. Europeans are still letting Americans in although they have Covid under better control than we."
2021-09-21 19:42:26,"Great! Thank you, Joe. Finally I can reconnect with my family and friends. After more than a year!"
2021-09-21 16:48:05,"What's also really strange is that Biden just announced on Monday that the US border would remain closed to Canadians a further month, until October 21st, for land crossings - despite that nearly 80% of Canadians over 12 are fully vaccinated (two shots).  

This is also very difficult on many US border towns that depend on the tourist dollars from Canada."
2021-09-16 11:17:42,"While I have some scientific background, I would hardly describe myself as a natural scientist. In fact, I don't have a great deal of respect for most ""scientists"" as I think of them as technicians or administrators at best.

I see myself as a social scientist, not that I don't recognize psychology as a natural science, working in the real world, the boweries of popuations where humanity thrives and dies.

We don't have lifetimes long enough for monthly changes in qualifications for booster shots. I thought I would soon qualify by age 74 to schedule for a Pfizer booster shot. But now I am told that the wait period is 8 months, not six months as we had been intimated recently. So we remain in lockdown, which is our status quo, but there are folks who continue to be treated negatively because they wear the mask, etc.

So, privately, I tell myself I should prepare to be found here no longer alive. Our grandparents would have come home from work, scrubbed their floors and in the morning or afternoon, 
scrubbed their bodies and put on clean clothes and laid themselves down. We no longer have concern for niceties."
2021-09-16 11:22:33,"The evidence clearly shows that protection against symptomatic infection has significantly declined.   Protection against symptomatic covid was the basis for approval of both the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines.  Now, the anti-booster health folk have turned things around and claimed that the narrow purpose (as if there is only one) of the vaccine is to prevent hospitalization/death amongst the vaccinated and since they still seem to be basically working on that front for most age groups, no need to boost.  But they are willfully ignoring the fact that there is a ton of utility in preventing ""mild"" covid and that preventing any symptoms was the basis for approving the vax.  They have their agenda, which is a valid and very principled agenda, of ensuring that folks in other countries have their chance at first doses before we boost.  But they're not advocating for that agenda in an honest way."
2021-09-16 10:51:05,"Now scientists and the White House in on the Coronavirus confusion around boosters. Mask or no mask? Lab or market? Vaccinate those under 12 or wait? Coronavirus here to stay or herd immunity? There CDC was confused throughout. Whatever happens with boosters, I certainly hope we get a handle on future pandemics in a less confusing manner."
2021-09-16 11:08:45,"The FDA is like a fire department that lets a building burn because it hasn't been established that the new fire truck is capable of putting out fires.

The vaccine is safe, Covid-19 is not.

There is evidence that booster shots restore antibody levels and some evidence that they reduce the chance of contracting the Delta variant.

By waiting for the scientific certainty before authorizing boosters, the FDA is taking the reckless approach rather than the conservative one."
2021-09-16 11:07:04,"This underscores the polticization of a complex problem that cannot be addressed wthout transparency and intellectual integrity. Unfortunately, we can expect continued politicization and infighting from politicians, corporate interests, scientists, and cultural warriors."
2021-09-16 11:45:26,"Not a scientist myself.That said,  it stands to reason that over time a vaccines effectiveness declines. How much, how fast, are the questions. The general sense one gets from reading about break through cases is that there is some increased risk after six or eight months. We also know that rolling out a nationwide vaccine is a months long intense logistical exercise.  To date, adverse effects beyond mild reactions on the day after the injection are virtually non existent.  The squabble among scientists is right and proper in understanding what available data really describes.  However. I am a little concerned this squabble has the appearance of interagency academic squabbling over the fine points of data analysis. The public health policy questions,  how many will die, get sick, seems to be taking a back seat  while the debate rages if vaccines are 84 or 89 percent effective after six months .  The  questions loom larger if one wonders if the vaccines will be only 60 percent effective after a  year and it will take five months to get everyone that third shot."
2021-09-16 11:46:28,"Granted, my only background in science are courses in high school and one introductory course in college. However, what I did take away from those courses, is not the certainties that the media seems to be promoting, but, rather the uncertainties of the experimental process. All these debates surrounding who, what, when, of vaccinations, I view as just part of that scientific process of achieving a full understanding of covid and developing a vaccination regime that will keep the public safe. Presently, scientists do not have a full understanding of this virus, and, thus, will continue the messy process of making sense out of how to best combat the spread of this disease. The same uncertainties were associated with all other diseases, from smallpox to polio. I wish the media would offer a more balanced understanding of how science works, instead of promoting the image of a politicized science community."
2021-09-16 11:37:35,The booster shot debate aside the real worrisome thing today is that children infected with Covid are flooding into hospitals and dying there. The way to reverse this dangerous trend is with a firm hand and that is to charge parents who refuse to mask or vaccinate their children  with criminal child abuse. That will give these cultists a wake up call.
2021-09-16 11:53:33,"I'm at the point where I'd rather wait.  In my 30's, fit and healthy, received the J&J vaccine.  Living in rural NY, I only have two regular contacts and consider my risk level low.  There are things I have questions about, such as the overall mortality rate of covid with and without vaccination that I never see mentioned in this paper.  My understanding was that the rate was very low even before the vaccines, in the single digits percentage-wise.  I believe at one point the mortality rate of Ebola Sudan was at one point around 90%, the plague that hit London in 1665 killed around a hundred thousand in a city of about half a million to put it in perspective.  I'm sure most people have been more affected by this pandemic than I have; I don't know anyone who's been seriously ill and the only people I know of who've died weren't taking care of themselves to begin with, but I would like to see a little more certainty on this issue before I go pumping myself full of more vaccines.  Also, have never seen any discussion of potential risks of overvaccination with these vaccines in this paper, guessing it's because they don't really know yet but would like to at least see some acknowledgment of this."
2021-09-16 11:36:17,"I am healthy and under 65.  I got my shot last spring and was glad to do it.  However, the hysteria around COVID-19 has been a big turn-off.  It seems our public health officials are no longer driven by data but by optics.  I have no intention of getting a booster until the evidence is all in that it is necessary."
2021-09-16 11:25:57,"We need agreement on the goals.  The continuum spans Illness, Hospitalization and Death.  Is the goal less hospitalization and death only?  It seems there are some in government that believe that is the objective and 2 doses continues to provide that threshold level of protection.  

Personally, I don't want to get ill and I think many in the US believe that is an attainable and reasonable objective if 3 doses can safely prevent communicable illness more than 2 doses.  

If we know the threshold of protection continues to drop and a 3rd dose is safe and effective, I'm not clear on the virtue of waiting anyway regardless of the whether the goal is only less hospitalization and death.  Death and hospitalization are lagging indicators.  If we wait until those go up, we are already late to the party.  The data and policy from Israel seems pretty compelling.  Don't wait."
2021-09-16 11:34:45,"I’ve lived by the book with the COVID pandemic. Isolated, at 73 years old, lived through two pacemaker implants, I went without seeing loved ones or anyone but my husband for months and months. Holidays and everything else came and went, we did it solo.  Masked and masked and masked everywhere we went.  Attended meetings virtually. Watched our neighbors isolated, and we just waved. Our grandkids were stuck at home from school,  too. We missed them. 

We also watched day after day the infected in the news.  The ventilators, the semis lined up for bodies. The funerals. We read obituaries and saw the photos of those who passed.  

Then we got the COVID vaccine as fast as we could, even though we had to wait for the availability - but we did it - to protect ourselves and others - so maybe we could live, even carefully in the time we have left. 

Now all I want is a third COVID vaccination because my Pfizer is waning, according to the experts. Other countries are getting theirs after six months. And their scientists say it’s helping to get a COVID booster at six months - not eight.  

We’ve played by the rules, not like those who refuse to vaccinate.

Now certain individuals are getting in our way by their interpretation of COVID and vaccines?  The FDA? The CDC? Shame on them!  So confused! 

My dad, father in law, husband fought for this country. I served as a registered nurse for years. 

Now - all I want is that 3rd vaccination. Give it to us now at six months!"
2021-09-16 11:43:15,"This scientific disagreement over boosters, (valid in my opinion, though I’m not a scientist), just feeds into conspiracy theories that somehow COVID is just about politics and profit. I feel for the sake of our country, and world’s health, and survival, Biden should call for a delay to his booster plan. And appoint the top scientists to a panel (including the Field’s preeminent experts, CDC and FDA experts, and including the two “dissenters”) to review all relevant data, so that the soundest scientific decision  on boosters will prevail."
2021-09-16 10:39:07,"Of course there is alway room for legitimate doubt, but if there is any doubt about the need for a third shot after eight months, the pandemic is so sever and unpredictable, that if we are going to err, we should err on the side of caution: approve the booster  for people with immune dysfunction, and seniors over 65."
2021-09-16 11:04:40,"Please do not forget that the first to call for booster shots was Pfizer, which stands to make a fortune from it.  The science is cloudy but the profit motive is crystal clear.  That is a problem for anyone who still thinks that public trust matters."
2021-09-16 10:56:29,"So far this discussion is completely devoid of any evaluation of long term immunity or immunological memory. That levels of circulating antibody decline over time is not a bug, it is a feature of the immune system. The question that needs answering is how well does an immune system respond to a second challenge after many months. That people get sick is not surprising, How sick and what the mortality rate is, are key questions that we have only anecdotal information about. We need data. It is mostly likely that an additional vaccine will not be harmful, but what is the true benefit?"
2021-09-16 11:35:11,"In Maryland, the booster is already being provided to anyone who says they are immunocompromised (proof not required). Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccine shots were made available last weekend at a street fair in Frederick, Maryland.  Governor Hogan is pushing the public to get the boosters.  So, the White House clearly got out over its science skis too soon and the public, convinced these shots will be beneficial, is eager to get additional protection against the Delta variant."
2021-09-16 11:10:55,"U.S. booster Policy is in Flux because it is based on results of selective studies. My observational study using an approach to determine what to consider as a ""gold standard"" for protection to determine if and when a booster could be considered was followed by a large well designed Israeli study which basically confirmed that those who acquired immunity to COVID following infection is better than those who were vaccinated and considered fully immunized with the Pfizer vaccine. 

There is mounting evidence 40 million surviving US residents who cleared COVID after acquiring robust immunity should be excluded from U.S. booster policy. Subjecting this population to a booster without first checking their immune status could have dangerous untold consequences.

Vaccine mandates will prove to be useless because they are based on selective science and do not represent the whole truth. Yesterdays WSJ reports FDA Says Covid Vaccines Remain Effective Without Boosters. A person who previously had COVID does not need a single vaccine shot which certainly could boost immunity but it is unclear whether such boost is essential for protection to remain effective. It is about time CDC, FDA and NIAID come to an agreement that 40 million surviving US residents previously confirmed positive COVID individuals henceforth are not required to get a single COVID vaccine shot unless there is a valid reason that such individuals are likely to get reinfected due to genetic or acquired immunodeficiency."
2021-09-16 11:38:39,"It is not that difficult

It should be recommended, but not required for ""vaccination status"" for now.
Since there are about 25% still trying to avoid the inevitable of getting their inoculation there is plenty available. Those of us who want that extra degree of protection for ourselves and families should get it to protect us from those who continue to try to infect us.

Require the first two shots for everyone who wants to participate in society, but until we drag those too childish to do it themselves into doing what is their patriotic civic duty, let us get the added shield against them if we want to."
2021-09-16 11:20:24,"Every year we are told over and over again that we need a new booster for flu because new variants of the flu virus circulate. 

But the heads of the FDA, seeing a new highly infectious variant of SARS-CoV2 causing dramatic surges in the UK and Israel, both more highly vaccinated countries, decline Pfizers offer to reconfigure its vaccine to include the Delta sequence. It is *unbelievably* BAD judgement on their part. 

The data says in real life says that this vaccine is NOT ENOUGH in itself to provide the level of protection required to resume normal life. That is 100% clear. The numbers coming out the UK show that without masks the levels of infection in vaccinated (as a % of the vaccinated population) and unvaccinated (as a % of the unvaccinated population) are THE SAME. This is consistent with the Israeli data - without masks, there is NO protection against infection from the current vaccine.  

There is some, but not dramatic levels, protection against hospitalization and more against death. But NOT ENOUGH to prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed if all precautions are lifted. This was seen in Israel, this was seen in Iceland, with 60% and 75% population level vaccination. 

The arguments against all rely on in vitro antibody binding assays being pushed by high profile scientists who are seeking attention for themselves. Why is ANYONE still relying on neutralizing antibody assays when the in vivo data is clear?

Bring out Delta specific boosters."
2021-09-16 11:22:36,Just seems another confusing chapter in the history of misinformation and dueling viewpoints since this pandemic began. The CDC was highly unclear. I have an autoimmune issue so have been hesitant to get a booster though I am sure it’s coming eventually.
2021-09-16 11:42:17,"A critical question is what antibody titer is adequate to provide protection? That can vary to some extent with individuals even within a group, although it is well known that the titer drops with time in everyone. We have neither the information available in various populations nor the numbers of individuals in any given population to provide it, yet. However, we are in somewhat of a crisis situation so we have to use historical and population norms for other diseases and vaccines.

What are the negatives in giving boosters, soreness, mild fever for a day or so? These beat the heck out of ending up in the hospital or dying."
2021-09-16 11:15:26,I keep reading these stories about a booster looking for what the harm of a third shot might be and can't find it. Is there potential physical harm in getting another dose or is it just a placebo to soothe anxious minds?
2021-09-16 10:59:17,"Everyone I know wants their booster.  They want to do whatever they have to do to live their lives safely.

Vaccine passports are the way to go."
2021-09-16 11:21:03,"If they cannot decide whether a third shot of the vaccine is needed, then let individuals decide for themselves whether they should get a third shot.  I received the Pfizer vaccine this spring.  I want a third shot now."
2021-09-16 11:53:13,"Kind of a moot discussion since millions have already gotten their booster shots.  No one is waiting for scientist or administration decisions.  Like masks and vaccines, they're doing it on their own.  Everyone is just exhausted by all this.  I know I am."
2021-09-16 11:53:19,"I fully expect the Administration to cave and scale back the booster initiative in an act of political expediency.  This further convinces me to do as Israel does and not as the CDC says.  We are swimming in unused vaccine.  Millions of doses going to waste.  We still haven't vaccinated our youngest cohort of kids.   We are back to losing 2,000 Americans per day, and still we haven't learned the lesson that we are in a war against a ruthless and shifting enemy.  On the battlefield you adapt to circumstances because the risks of doing nothing are catastrophic.  Welcome to analysis paralysis."
2021-09-16 11:31:35,I anticipate that this good faith disagreement on data interpretation by well-intentioned experts (who may focus on different aspects of “public health”) will be quickly politically weaponized by those whose intentions and focus are on themselves and their party. Am I wrong…?
2021-09-16 10:51:37,Time for leadership to step in. In an abundance of caution just provide the boosters now for immune deficient and those over 65. Come on FDA/CDC. The shot is safe so move along please.
2021-09-16 11:47:55,"Every other day it seems one article in this paper reports on evidence that goes one way, then the other.  David Leonhardt sends out and email answering questions which always has some caveat to findings pointing in a certain direction.  Biden means well.  He's also using this as a political win for himself as being the tough, rational science man that is putting his foot down to contain the coronavirus.  The polls show the majority of people approve of these actions.  He needs a political plus to offset the events of the Afghanistan withdrawal.  The downside is, he may be too anxious to jump ahead of solid evidence that a booster makes sense at this time.  He gets more egg on his face by the scientific debate over the effectiveness after he's announced a decision.  There's also a good deal of debate whether the booster is ethical without solid empirical evidence if it makes a difference when so much of the world population has not received any vaccination.  Biden should either direct the booster to those segments of the population most at risk or just give it to everyone saying the virus has been plaguing us too long and he'd rather err on too much than too little.  It's   already being done in the Czech Republic, Germany, France and Israel.  At the same time, Biden needs to keep production up or increase it to vaccinate the poor countries,"
2021-09-16 11:46:19,"My new booster policy is to avoid reading articles about booster shots. It has become much too frustrating, especially since I got the J&J vaccine. I think the J&J vaccine should have been approved only for emergency use in areas lacking adequate refrigeration. You know, like the areas in the United States that shamefully lack clean water and electricity.

And virologist Moore might reconsider referring to booster shots as “cake”. Cake is a treat. What we need to know is whether a booster shot program will help preserve public health, save lives, and enable society to return to normalcy."
2021-09-16 11:03:58,"Make the boosters available and allow people to decide if they want another jab. Consider that many American adults, their politics aside, do have the capabilities to make these kinds of decisions about their health. The elderly and those with pre-existing conditions should be first on the list. Most of us are weary of vaccine debates. In the meantime, I’m fully vaccinated but wear masks in public. I live in a small southern Trumpie town where a lot of good old boys and girls still smoke, eat their fried foods, love their guns and are yet to get their first Covid shot. Covid cases continue to rise here. Yes, I want a booster. 

And is the FDA still the gold-standard in pronouncements about what Americans need to stay healthy? They are a bureaucratic bunch always dragging  their feet in approving worthwhile drugs."
2021-09-16 11:10:46,"This is not rocket science.  Keep vaccinated people healthy, especially in the south.  Booster shots all around."
2021-09-16 11:09:26,I am waiting for my booster shot. I am 73 and diabetic. My Pfizer vaccines is nit that effective after 8 months. Israel and some European countries have already started administering booster shot. I want my booster shot without delay.
2021-09-16 11:02:46,"We got rid of one president who didn’t understand science and had a high risk tolerance, and replaced him with another president who doesn’t understand science and has a lower risk tolerance."
2021-09-16 11:05:58,The reality is that Pfizer and moderna are the main drivers of Recommending boosters. Talk about a conflict of interest.
2021-09-16 12:01:39,"I am a pro-science Democrat, and am embarrassed at how convinced our “side” has become, throughout the pandemic, that maximum interventions are always the best interventions. 

Science has consistently indicated that it’s not so simple, but we cannot see the nuances because we defensive against the Republican position of minimizing the virus.

Personally, I read the research studies and follow scientists who aren’t afraid to challenge this orthodoxy. I feel great knowing I am protected by the 2-dose vaccine and even welcome a “breakthrough” infection so I can start building more robust immunity as covid becomes endemic. I am in no rush to get a booster."
2021-09-16 11:47:17,I'm ashamed to be a citizen of a country that would even consider offering booster shots when much of the world remains unvaccinated.
2021-09-16 11:56:48,Use POTUS power to influence our pharma to share the process for producing the vaccines. Give a man a fish...
2021-09-16 11:59:43,"Bless all of you insightful enough to begin with “I am not a scientist” or some variation. 

Waiting to hear what Dr Fauci thinks. 

Have been listening to his opinions for over thirty years. When he doesn’t know, he’ll say so. Unpopular opinion, doesn’t matter. When he does have an opinion, he has the necessary knowledge and experience. He can explain why he thinks what he does and cite sources.

Paging Dr Fauci, please."
2021-09-16 12:03:24,crazy. so many people are walking into CVS and getting the booster shots. easy. more undecipherable communication and mis management from government. ugh.
2021-09-16 12:08:31,"Since Biden did not fire most of the Upper Crust of the CDC, NIH, and FDA he is getting the same junk science from so-called experts that Trump received. Since Biden is not science literate, we are seeing him get steam rolled by the same people that steam rolled trump.

Listen to the real SARS-COV-2 experts along with the expert who designed, developed, and manufacture the vaccines. Use your own eyes to read studies from other countries."
2021-09-16 12:08:42,"“It’s much better for them to say, ‘Here’s how we looked at the data, here are the conclusions we made from the data, and here’s why we’re making the conclusions.’”

And here's the America people: 'Snooooooze'.

If Dr. Sharfstein actually lived in the United States - which apparently he does not - he would know that any 'This seems to show this, but on the other hand...'  is deadly.

 Most Americans (including me) just want to know, given my circumstance, what would should I do? Any perceived confusion will  A. make already vaccine hesitant  people more hesitant, and B. will be exploited by the Right for political reasons.

My advice? Drop the mic."
2021-09-16 12:09:25,"The federal government has failed us so miserably by 1) mixed messaging in the beginning on masks, contagion, risk and prevention; 2) mixed messaging in the middle on masks and preventative measures and allowable activities for the vaccinated. Even quarantine guidance for the vaccinated who have been exposed appears to be utterly inaccurate and unreliable in that the CDC guidance that if vaccinated and exposed there is no need to quarantine unless you exhibit symptoms. But aren’t you contagious two days before symptoms and wasn’t that guidance based on a false premise that the vaccinated were not contagious ? and; 3) eternal never ending mixed messaging on vaccines,  boosters, masks, quarantine and everything COVID. 

There is a lesson here about transparency, honesty, integrity that will evade us because COVID will either kill us  before we learn it or if we survive, it will only be for so long because our stubborn unwillingness to own our mistakes and missteps will keep COVID very much alive to finish us off - which is where we are now. Herd immunity you say? not really , in light of reinfection by mutated virus. This is a war and we have not won a war since WWII - apparently we have forgotten how to win wars. We are losing this one."
2021-09-16 12:09:27,"Quit complaining that Biden doesn't understand science. He has to keep the messaging simple because Americans' scientific literacy is abysmal. We want simple answers, and we want them now. That, of course, is now how science works, but if Biden were to delay decisions, people would just complain he's dragging his feet. It's a no-win situation. The real answer is getting every eligible American vaccinated, but then our abysmal scientific literacy precludes that outcome. Catch-22."
2021-09-16 11:59:43,"""And in The Lancet this week, an article written by two of the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine scientists, among others, argued that there was no credible evidence that the vaccines’ potency against severe disease declined substantially over time. The two scientists had announced that they would leave the agency this fall, but their public opposition to the administration’s plan caught the F.D.A.’s top leaders by surprise and forced the White House on the defensive.""

One should read this Lancet opinion piece that offers no new findings-but only an argument that the world should be vaccinated before boosters.  The politicization is from the two FDA members-not the Biden administration.  The paper was prepared for a WHO event of the paper's title.  I don't mind supporting underprivileged countries, but not at the expense of American lives."
2021-09-16 12:06:42,"The Lancet article, authored by the exFDA execs and representatives from the WHO, was politics not science.  It states clearly that saving vaccines for the third world is a priority.  That has nothing to do with booster efficacy and everything to do with how the article cherry-picked data.  The NEJM article from Israel is pretty clear the third shot works, and as a physician, I can say most of my colleagues agree.  Biden (and I am a Republican) is completely correct on boosters.  But he needs to do his job and appoint a qualified head of the FDA who can run that shop, fix the CDC, and not know-tow to politics trying to find someone acceptable to both Manchin and Sanders."
2021-09-16 12:21:05,"Having well-controlled studies and an accumulation of data is vitally important, but we are in the middle of a pandemic that is constantly shifting.  We went through this in the early days of the HIV epidemic when those in the trenches could not wait for all the data to be collected but had to make our best guesses at what might work.  Those objecting to booster shots fear side effects like Guillain-Barre, seen in a vanishingly small number of people who got adenovirus vaccine like the J&J.  They also cite the need to get vaccine to poorer countries. These are valid points.  If they really wanted to get more vaccine to the world, though, they would activate compulsory licensing and force Pfizer and Moderna to share their technology with the rest of the world in order to allow countries to build their own vaccine production capabilities.  Letting these companies hold vital technology hostage is everything that is wrong with the way we develop drugs.  As others have said, though, millions of us are speaking up by sticking out our arms for the third shot.  Every other doctor I know has gotten one.  So dither all you want ivory-tower talking heads.  I'll take an antibody boost as long as I have to live around the virulent anti-vaxxers in Florida and I'll be first in line when the next iteration of the vaccine comes out that works better against new variants."
2021-09-16 12:21:26,"The variation in the incidence of cases between both groups seems insignificant. Also the number of hospitalizations, three, and deaths, two in the older group is so small as not to lead to any conclusions. 

Also Moderna did not say it but seems obvious that there were differences in the composition of the two groups as the older one was comprised of volunteers and the newer group came from the general population. The FDA needs to review this more deeply before making any recommendations."
2021-09-16 12:23:20,"So, do we have to go to Israel to get a booster?"
2021-09-16 12:37:02,"I’m not an epidemiologist but I have read that the effectiveness of the vaccines is dependent on the length of time between doses as well. In Israel, they administered Pfizer 3 weeks apart, but in the UK where they administered doses up to 8 weeks apart and mixed different vaccines, the effectiveness of vaccination has remained higher. I took Moderna 4 weeks apart and from what I understand, Moderna seems to be somewhat more effective against Delta. Perhaps this is why, or part of why. It seems to me that we need to compare apples to apples. Israel may not be a perfect example for us. And since breakthrough infections appear to be pretty mild and confer far higher immunity than just vaccination, maybe we shouldn’t be super worried about protecting against infection in healthy vaccinated people. Personally I’m far more worried about most of the world remaining unvaccinated and the consequent likelihood of much worse variants than Delta."
2021-09-16 12:38:13,"Approving boosters for 65 and over, as well as at-risk people, will do fine for right now until they analyze more data. In fact, anyone over 65 can get a booster today at one of these participating drugstore clinics. The medical community is just a nose distance behind this virus and data is continually being absorbed. It's not easy to find 100% agreement, we do our best."
2021-09-16 12:21:24,"The Lancet article was a Commentary; essentially an opinion piece. The NEJM article was an actual study. The NYT frames these as ""dueling""...if so, it's a sword versus a butter knife.

The evidence is clear: boosters help. The narrative that vulnerable elderly in the USA should wait for the rest of the world is nonsense."
2021-09-16 12:15:57,"There is an insidious campaign worldwide that is now in high gear, especially in the US and Europe. This campaign was started by the World Health Organization and has been joined by politically motivated medical people and their supporters in Europe and the US, including some within the FDA itself. The campaign is really very cold, cruel, and crude, but it is being promoted with humanitarian lipstick on the filthy pig underneath.

Stated bluntly, the WHO and its supporters want to sacrifice the lives of Americans by denying them vaccine booster shots so those shots can be donated at Americans' expense to protect more persons in the third world (they are not satisfied that, as of August 3, the US had already donated over 110 million doses of vaccine to 65 countries...and you can be sure that those countries directed the doses we gave them to politicians and other well-connected people, not to the regular population).

Fortunately for Americans, Biden himself publicly promised booster shots for every American. Many on his political team probably are upset that he did so personally and publicly because that will make it more difficult for Biden to go back on his word by withholding booster shots for many Americans. But Biden's ""progressive"" supporters have great influence over him, so it remains a substantial possibility.  You can see by the silence of Biden, that the Biden team is already preparing him to go back on his promise to Americans."
2021-09-16 12:15:03,"What we are not being told is whether there is a downside to a third shot, such as the possibility of creating a vaccine-resistant mutation?

In the meantime, other first world countries such as Israel and the Uk are charging ahead with boosters.  Psst - winter is a’coming!"
2021-09-16 12:26:46,Let us hope that science dictates policy and not political correctness.
2021-09-16 12:31:23,"I am baffled why journalists turn to officials and selected authorities and leave out some of the most important sources of information, such as Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic etc.  That's where people should be going for information, not to selected individuals and officials."
2021-09-16 12:33:32,"A serious problem with this article, in my opinion, is that the writers present information about people's reaction to the information from Israel and elsewhere before they present the information itself.  This just fuels controversy ahead of providing readers with the bases to increase their understanding of the issues.  The issues themselves are not 100% clear cut - but what issues are?
 I, for one, am not helped by quotations like the one about cake, which is  a simply hostile pronouncement from a person who has no responsibility for policy. (Might as well have found someone to say that Biden is a fool, which he is not despite however many people might be found to say as much.)

I wonder whether journalists might serve themselves (and us readers) more effectively by putting actual information first, and then the opinions of those they deem experts."
2021-09-16 12:21:39,"How about studying who is getting COVID in the schools?  The vaccinated or unvaccinated kids?  Kids from families which have been vaccinated or from the non vaccinated?  What about the teachers?  

A group of marchers here, opposed to getting vaccinated, dragged their little kids along in the protest.  The group included our County Sheriff, leading the group, mind you, and some registered nurses who oppose vaccination.  

It made me sick."
2021-09-16 12:29:53,"Not only did I receive the vaccine in January but I have received a booster. Just went to CVS and got it. What is the big deal here? Cost of offering it for free aside, is there any harm to getting a booster?  Even if you're unsure about the necessity, why not get it just in case it does provide extra protection?  Likewise with the unvaccinated, even if you think you won't get sick and it's all a hoax, couldn't you just do it anyway on the off chance it isn't or just to help relieve the worry that the rest of us feel?"
2021-09-16 12:34:13,"One shouldn't lump together actual studies, which measure titres of neutralizing antibodies as they decline post-vaccination, or report on protection from symptomatic disease or hospitalization after vaccination, and opinion piece/commentary that appeared in Lancet. The bulk of research data strongly indicates that a) protection against Covid-19 decreases with time post-vaccination and can not only be restored but augmented with booster dose; b) despite hypervigilant overreaction to rare instances of neurological, cardiac, and cerebral thrombosis events these ""side effects"" are not correlated with vaccinations when evaluated using robust and complete oranges-to-same-oranges comparisons (e.g. the same 4 million Brits before and after vaccination instead of comparing vaccinated population to some expected (conjectural) frequency of these events). 
Lancet opinion piece is a hack job, overstating the danger of side-effects, neglecting the actual longitudinal research on vaccination efficiency, and pretending that lapses in vaccinations worldwide have to do with Americans wanting boosters instead of regional policies and profiteering by big pharma (e.g. Pfizer agreeing to sell some doses of its vaccine to US for 3$ to be donated to third world countries, while charging in excess of 20$ per dose to be distributed in US and EU)."
2021-09-16 12:21:43,"I am shocked and dismayed by the virulent rage directed at anyone who questions the Biden administration’s booster agenda. I am 37, healthy, and have had the first two Moderna shots. I do not want the booster. The dissent described above is enough for me to want to wait until evidence is more conclusive. And yet in expressing this concern to people around me (naturally people of the progressive persuasion), I have been met with strident derision. I will make my own decision for my own body— once the evidence is more conclusive. And I will never apologize for using my brain, intuition, and natural skepticism in making choices for my health."
2021-09-16 12:33:00,"I'm waiting for the day when the availability and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines is similar to that of the seasonal flu. As there will always be antivaxxers out there, the combination of readily available vaccines and mandatory testing (as appropriate) may represent how we will evolve out of this pandemic."
2021-09-16 12:20:15,"What is/are the specific risk/s to health (not avoidance of potential harm) of receiving a 3rd Pfizer ""booster"" shot?  If any, are they new risks or of a different risk harm than the initial Pfizer vaccination?"
2021-09-16 12:25:44,"Political motivation became dominant at the CDC at least as early as during the Obama administration. It was obvious under Trump and continues obvious under Biden.  Now the FDA reveals itself also politically motivated.

The FDA staff gave a reason for its refusal to take a position on Covid boosters. They said that there was no evidence that a booster is needed (they just completely dismiss the Israeli data). But the FDA is supposed to judge the efficacy and safety of drugs, not whether a drug is ""necessary"". When the FDA acts (or refuses to act) based upon a drug being ""necessary"", it is being political. For example, suppose there are some existing drugs which effectively treat some condition, then suppose a new drug to treat the same condition seeks FDA approval. That new drug is not ""necessary"" but if it is safe and effective it is supposed to get approved by the FDA and does when the FDA is acting based on its Congressional mission and science. Only when the FDA was acting politically would it deny approval to the new drug as ""not necessary"".

The FDA and CDC have seriously damaged their own credibility.  I would trust the Israeli data and the judgement of their medical professionals before I would trust the FDA or CDC."
2021-09-16 12:33:11,Seems like we are far enough out in this whole process that we can just forget all the politics and simply do an annual update jab along with the rest of the annual virus shots. All viruses mutate.
2021-09-16 12:17:00,"Meanwhile, I walked right into Walgreens and got my 3rd shot 8 months to the day after my second dose. I have no pre-existing conditions except I am a human who does not want to get Covid. I work with the public on a daily basis and can not imagine I have not been exposed to it, yet I have stayed healthy. So, go ahead, don't get the vaccine. 1st, 2nd or 3rd. That leaves more for those of us who want it."
2021-09-16 12:39:50,"""The public needs cake and deserves cake, and so shall have cake.”  That doctor's remark is condescending and insensitive. This is a life-or-death issue to many people, especially seniors.

Israeli data shows that people vaccinated 6 months ago were increasingly developing severe covid, and that risk declined after boosters. Is the FDA waiting for more vaccinated Americans to die of covid or need ventilators before it will approve boosters? Besides Israel, France, Germany, and the U.K. have endorsed boosters for their citizens. The U.S. should do the same."
2021-09-16 12:45:45,"At this point, why not let mother nature runs its course?  

We are too many; living too long, spreading like wildfire, and on top of that destructing Mother Earth like no other stubborn living parasite has ever done with superfluous created needs...

Let's deal with the consequences as they come and forget about spending so much money and time on people who will bring others back to square one.

We can't be living like this forever..."
2021-09-16 12:55:33,"We are both retired from jobs in healthcare. In the face of dithering and incompetence, my wife and I followed the science, the Israeli science. I got a full dose third Moderna shot and she a full dose Pfizer. Minor reaction to the Moderna; major reaction to the Pfizer. My guess is this validates other studies that the Pfizer loses efficacy quicker but the third shot boosts it radically. In any event we are as fully protected as possible and believe people should make their own decisions."
2021-09-16 12:48:04,A couple of shallow but striking uses of language by medical experts in this article point to a troubling trend: Cornell virologist John P. Moore's use of the cake metaphor and Johns Hopkins Dr. Joshua Sharfstein's quip about 'mic drop'. In neither case do these jokes clarify what the speakers are talking about. Are these doctors experts or pundits; are they scientists or entertainers? Have they learned they need to use this sort of flippant language to attract the attention of journalists and readers?
2021-09-16 12:35:07,"There's a very simple solution to the problem of the unvaccinated in America. The Federal govt can publish the percent of the vaccinated in each state and the number of daily deaths from covid in each state. The effectiveness of the vacine will become immediately obvious. People who refuse to believe anything coming from the govt will be shown up as dangerous antisocial cranks. The vast majority can then deal with them as they see fit. Financial penalties or withdrawal of benefits, immediately fully restored on vaccination, for example?"
2021-09-16 12:40:01,"This article refers to an NEJM article on the study in Israel. The week before there was another article in NEJM about a study of health care workers who got their vaccine in January and it was determined to be 95% effective. In July that same study group of health care workers were determined to be 65% effective against the virus. The government keeps saying it's ""following the science"" but which science; it seems there's almost always disagreement among scientists. And so I remain skeptical about health care advice coming from government, social media or professional media. I rely on my PCP who strongly recommended my 75 year old diabetic body get a third dose of Moderna. Which I did."
2021-09-16 12:42:22,"I want to hear about the pros and cons of mix and match.  After two shot of mRNA Pfizer would a shot of the more traditional J & J produce a more robust immune response?  And, are Pfizer and Moderna tweaking their vaccine to attack the Delta variant?"
2021-09-16 12:39:15,"OK once more, science takes time!! Figuring out what a new pathogen is, what it's chemistry is, how it's replication works, how it enters our bodies and how it damages them and then how to fight it in the short term and then the long term...takes time.
Already a lot of people have died, a lot have suffered, economies are shaky but it does not help to turn such a world wide crisis into some sort of political game, to use the crisis to score points against the other team.
There has been great successes in the development of vaccines and other ways to mitigate the human suffering but there is still a long way to go to fully understand and control this pathogen. 
Stop acting like self involved three year old children, put on the mask, get the shots, get more shots if advised or don't if they are not advised. Care for your family, look out for your neighbor. This will take some time, maybe a lot of time."
2021-09-16 12:48:01,It seems to me that we should not be distributing booster shots until a large percentage of the world is vaccinated.  The tone of many of the comments (although not all) is that American lives are worth more and should be protected first.  This type of imperialist/colonialist thinking got us into this mess in the first place.
2021-09-16 12:38:59,"The FDA and CDC have failed the public from the very beginning, as some Commenters have pointed out. All of the vaccines available to U.S. citizens have already been proven safe and effective. The arguments by ""experts"" for/against boosters appear to be largely political and at this point it should be up to each individual to decide booster or not. P.S. - For those that have already been fully vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you can walk into any pharmacy providing the vaccine and declare that you are immunocompromised and request the booster. The pharmacies cannot/will not ask ask the who, what, when, etc. and must provide the booster to you. For J&J, sorry you have to wait."
2021-09-16 12:34:45,Why is there never any information about the J & J shots in any of these articles?
2021-09-16 12:59:52,"Many of those who refuse vaccination and resist mask wearing are doing so out of political-philosophical motivation.  They want to increase the risk of infection and death for themselves and for others that they interact with.  

Many on the political left (correctly) condemn those who refuse vaccination for substituting politics for science.

But this booster controversy reveals that hypocrisy thrives among many on the left, especially among ""progressives"".  Now we have many of them wanting to deny booster vaccinations to Americans based upon political-philosophical motivation.  They want to cause more Americans to suffer and die in order to protect the health of people in other countries whose lives they care about more than they care about Americans."
2021-09-16 13:04:53,I appreciate the transparency after the Trump fiasco but its not helpful when equally esteemed experts are arguing in public about our health and safety.  Confusion breeds anxiety.
2021-09-16 13:24:40,"Hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses will expire if not used, and the vaccine requiring extreme cold storage, specifically the Pfizer,  is difficult to administer in many Third World countries, which lack a physical infrastructure that would allow the vaccines to be widely administered to their populations. The logistics are daunting. Booster shots, if considered necessary for the immunocompromised and the elderly ( in whom the immune response is naturally diminished without ), should be administered as soon as possible."
2021-09-16 13:22:28,"Really hate to say this, but I expect the decisions on booster shots made in Israel, a country that believes in taking care of its own, will prove more trustworthy than those made here, where a pair of disgruntled FDA employees are seeking to shoot the Biden Administration down on their way out the door and where reporters from a major media organization have taken sides on the issue from an intellectual agenda pitting their own concept of global social justice against the interests of older Americans.

I hope the president can stand up to the political pressure. We’ve turned in some of the world’s worst Covid casualty figures despite our commanding more resources than anyone else on the planet. Starting yet another fracas now will only make things worse; as we might have trouble achieving a high uptake with the boosters in any event. Although differences in methodology and population characteristics between Israel and the US are as real as the FDA tells us they are, I see little reason to think the Israeli surge isn’t being repeated on our shores, or that we won’t be threatened over the winter as we move back indoors for our holiday gatherings."
2021-09-16 13:25:39,"Three elderly people have died in my small local community in the last few days.  All fully vaccinated.  I have read of no downside of taking a third shot at all.  We now have more than adequate vaccine, in fact, cant give it away to a good part of the population.  In the name of the freedom that those who refuse even a single shot, at this time please allow those of us who are elderly the option of a third shot.  People are dying, I completely respect the scientific protocols of how much benefit a third shot would provide, but as there seems to be zero downside, how about approving just another 'emergency' approval.  For those elderly and at risk, it is clearly a risk worth taking."
2021-09-16 13:35:17,"At this point, the critical question is: Does it do any harm? The answer seems to be ""No"" and therefore, administering a booster dose will help maintain sanity among all including the recipients of the initial two doses of these vaccines. We do not need other points of doubt added to the overhanging cloud."
2021-09-16 14:12:51,"I got my booster shot on Tuesday. 
Signed up at CVS on line. They made it really easy.  Got my flu vaccine same day - one in each arm.

2021-09-16 13:58:59,Nothing in this indicates any reason NOT to get a booster shot.
2021-09-16 14:31:19,"This is all ridiculous. There are millions of people that will not get vaccinated thus a large supply everywhere of the vaccines.
Sorry but it’s just too easy to lie and just say you need your second dose. Don’t bring your card and they give you a new one. There is absolutely no cross referencing of shots.
The bottom of the form that no one reads actually says they cannot ask for ID, payment or really nothing. The form for the immunocompromised folks just asks that, are you? They are not allowed to ask with what and if they do you can just say I rather not tell. I know this because I am immunocompromised and got a booster three weeks ago and read the entire form. But if not for that I was just going to go and get a third shot and say I missed my second. If you want a booster go get one, millions of people have done exactly what I am telling you."
2021-09-16 14:33:50,It would help your readers understand the need (or not) for booster shots if The NY Times would report in the Daily COVID Report the number of deaths from Breakthrough Infections.

2021-09-16 13:32:14,"The shelf live of a vaccine that is unopened appears to be 30 days. The president promised booster shots. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle. It is far better to give boosters to those who want them to throw away vaccine doses. China has vaccinated a billion people so far. You can prevent death and spread with a shot. This is essentially a war on a pandemic/plague/disease, you pick.
During the second world war there were blackouts in coastal cities so submarines could not have an easy target for shipping overseas. Did cities rise up and say our freedom to run a business and attract customers is at risk and our freedoms are being infringed upon by a government that will not gives us our constitutional rights? Come on. We have the means to stem this disease. 
Perhaps we should have followed the 1918 model. Let things go on as they were and the plague would be over. People my age, including me, might be dead, but perhaps that would open up more jobs in the economy? It is highly likely that those individuals who are anti vaccine would then criticize the government for not doing something. Have we lost our collective mind? BTW if the NYT Covid-19 map is accurate there is far less of an outbreak in many places in Africa. Do those people have a built in immunity or do our roads, airports and ease of travel provide a vector for the spread of Covid-19? 
For a few months after 9/11 we seemed to be a united country. It fell apart a bit too quickly."
2021-09-16 14:49:16,"When an opportunity presented itself out of the blue for me to get a booster last week, no one needed to ask me twice to roll up my sleeve. I suspected that the booster plan might never be fully rolled out beyond the immunocompromised and possibly the elderly. As every day passes, I am happier that I got so lucky."
2021-09-16 15:13:02,"As a 74 year old I am tired  of the way the controversy over booster shots is presented.  Most experts agree that boosters are of value to seniors and others at risk for break through infections, many of which can be serious in seniors. The debate therefore needs to be  confined to whether boosters are needed in younger people, a subject that will be determined when more information is available.  In the meantime, all seniors previously vaccinated must receive their boosters immediately, something that will have litte effect on the vaccination program world wide.  We are not 'only' seniors but people with special needs who must be given access to needed booster shots.  If I need a yearly booster so be it."
2021-09-16 15:40:09,"The analogy of ""eat cake"" is ridiculous. Boosters are being given by a number of countries. We have already seen how Delta has upended the previously held medical beliefs about breakthrough infections. Our hospitals are full and ""elective"" surgery like heart and cancer surgeries (first time I thought of these as ""elective"") are being postponed because of the rapid increase of COVID infections.  If we do not have boosters in another year we will be wondering why we listened again to the CDC and FDA who in the beginning had it wrong about masking as well as younger adults and children would not be getting sick.  My 5 year old grandson was infected by a family member - luckily he did not die!  But we cannot ""pretend"" that not giving boosters is a good medical idea."
2021-09-16 15:24:51,"This ""controversy"" seems to stem from the two FDA scientists who are resigning, apparently in protest of how this issue is being handled by the Biden administration. From what I've read I sense two possible reasons for their dissent, that they weren't properly consulted and that they feel these shots might better be used elsewhere in the world.

I'm sorry, but I really don't care about those issues. If the dissenting scientists feelings were hurt, tough. And as to using these doses of vaccine elsewhere, is that really practical or just the expression some sort of principle that ""equity"" must infect every public discussion these days?

Sometimes these experts get a bit too aloof from the reality we all face in our day-to-day lives. Would they tell their family member who is fearful of Covid and doing their best to avoid it by being vaccinated, wearing masks, socially distancing and who would like the extra protection of a booster shot, ""Well I'm sorry, but you can't have one because my feelings were hurt and I think your shot would be better used in Africa?"" Of course they wouldn't, they'd figure out how to get their loved one the shot they want.

I'm 75 years old, it's been seven months since I got my second Pfizer shot, there is evidence that the vaccine's effectiveness fades, Delta is raging and I don't want to get sick at all, not just be protected from hospitalization or death and there seems to be no harm in a booster. Let me have it. Or should I just cheat to get it?"
2021-09-16 16:24:36,"There is one, and only one, reason for an American adult not to get a booster shot: the argument that boosters are immoral while vaccine supplies are insufficient to vaccinate people in third-world countries -- the argument that a booster is akin to handing some passengers a third parachute on an airplane when most passengers don't have even one.

Most Americans will acknowledge that argument but ignore it (I will). A few Americans (very few) won't. Many other Americans will acknowledge the argument but will insist that vaccine supplies are indeed sufficient, or could be but for the avarice of giant pharmaceutical companies; they will not acknowledge their own avarice.

The result? Most vaccinated American adults (at least those who got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine) will get a booster shot at the earliest opportunity. I will. Only the anti-vaxxers won't."
2021-09-16 16:32:28,"Some of those who have written comments regarding this article say they have already received a booster shot of the Covid vaccine in the US.  Am I wrong to infer that they lied to the provider that they had not been vaccinated to accomplish this?  Leaving aside the morality of such behavior, I wonder if such behavior would make it more difficult for public health officials and scientists to accurately determine how many shots everyone has gotten to judge the duration of the effectiveness of the vaccines.

About 80% of US population over 60 are fully vaccinated

2021-09-16 17:14:35,"Did anyone else find this ""expert's"" statement offensive?

“Weeks ago, the administration decided that the public needs cake and deserves cake, and so shall have cake,” he said. 'Now, the public expects cake and would be very annoyed if its cake was taken away at this point.'”

So what did he mean by ""cake""? 
1. The booster is an unnecessary luxury that is not really needed (perhaps supporting the global inequality of vaccination distribution issue)?

2. The public is greedy and wants what is promised, just for the sake of getting something for free? (a very cavalier statement with regard to a pandemic--vaccines to protect against a lethal disease are not like eating cake Marie Antoinette style)? 

Maybe the reporter should have probed further with the expert to clarify what his ""cake"" reference meant."
2021-09-16 16:55:12,"This ""confusion"" over the booster vaccination only adds to the public's confusion. 

The need for a booster was initially explained to us as: a. the covid vaccines seem to lose some efficacy over time; & b. strengthening is needed due to the Delta variant and likely other mutating variants of the virus (as we are not seeing). So, a 3rd shot would add more protection against the effects of fading strength over time and fighting new variants. Made sense. 

But I am not clear about the reasons why some experts are against the booster. 
1.  As an older person without much medical knowledge about vaccines and viruses, my common sense says ""what harm can it do to get a 3rd short, if it can help protect us slightly more against covid?""  

2. But also, I suspect the fade-out effect may be stronger for older folks and those with compromised immune systems, whereas most people sustain the effectiveness of the vaccine longer. So, maybe only these more fragile groups need the booster. Is that what the reluctant experts are saying?

Please keep it simple. Maybe we don't really need to know how the sausage is being made and the debates within the profession.

What we in the public need is a listing of the benefits and the risks of the 3rd shot, the advantages and the disadvantages of adding the booster, and the groups of people the booster will most benefit versus those who likely will not receive much extra benefit.

What are the reasons for not having a booster? Global inequality is one"
2021-09-16 17:33:39,"As a senior with three mild autoimmune disorders, I have no idea how well protected I am from Covid or whether Covid would trigger any of those disorders and lead to months of illness, even if not severe.  Therefore, as soon as I am eligible for a booster shot I will take it.  Better safe than sorry.  (I do wish everyone--government and vaccine makers) would get on the same page, though."

I for one will be doing so; my family and I live in anti-mask, anti-vaxx Texas and I want us to have all the protection we and our families can get. I already have several family members of various ages who got Covid; 2 of whom were vaccinated and had to be hospitalized. My sweetheart has heart disease, and is vaccinated but I want him to be protected as much as possible. I am relatively healthy, but I am in my late 50’s and am concerned about the waning immunity. Our children work in fields where they risk exposure and I want them protected as much as possible as well.

The Israeli study has me very concerned, plus we are heading into fall/winter where an already high Covid case rate will likely go higher. Are they going to wait until the vaccinated start getting hospitalized and dying in higher numbers? This seems highly irresponsible to me."

I’m not taking a chance waiting for any official “approvals.” Went last week into a local pharmacy and got a booster, about 7 months after my 2nd vaccine. We need only look at the hospital surges across Israel to see what’s in store for us here in the U.S."

2021-09-16 20:09:23,"Most current debates are unsupported by facts. 
If it were the case that boosters were taking available vaccine away from willing patients, then rationing the vaccine would make some sense. The willing populace is pretty much fully vaxxed so protect them, and others, by further reducing their risk of transmission. Arguing for people who won’t be vaccinated is like counting the proverbial angels on the head of the pin.  If we had a broad societal vax mandate, which we do not, maybe keep the vax in reserve, but the ""or test weekly"" proviso as a vaxxing alternative is exactly where the deniers are now, kicks the can down the road with no incentive for them to change. 
There are no medical risk factors that contraindicate boosters. If you got your two shots, you can be virtually assured the third isn't going to harm you. My immunosuppressed lung tx son received his third Moderna; had the expected day of malaise, and is now fine. Since he’s in med school, he needed the protection. 
Vaxxing and masking kids is a purely emotional discussion. COVID has not been a serious fatal disease for them. More kids 0-17 died of flu in 2017-18 than from COVID per CDC demographic reports. Yes more of them are infected by Delta but even CDC data suggests that case fatality rates for kids have declined since April 29 (Delta). Yes, more are hospitalized but up to 70% of them have an underlying medical issue, all this from CDC. COVID has been serious for those over 50, with 95% of all deaths."
2021-09-16 17:54:20,"The proponents for a third booster are emotionally committed to their stance. The fear of infection, hospitalization and death will do that to you, no doubt about it.

However, fear and panic -- its compatriot -- are not ideal states of mind for clear decision making.

Drs. Gruber and Krause are arguing that there's not enough data and as yet no genuine ""follow the science"" edict to make.

The Israeli booster campaign has given out more than 2 million doses, but data they've collected is limited -- ""just a week or so after the third dose and might not hold up over time, and that 'a very short-term protective effect would not necessarily imply worthwhile long-term benefit.' ""

Adding to their reluctance is the appearance of political pressure from the Biden team.  Acting FDA director Dr. Janet Woodcock is a Biden appointee. Her public support of a 3rd booster  ""increased pressure on scientists weighing the evidence for boosters in their respective agencies to go along with the administration’s strategy.""

The same agency took its sweet time to fully approve the vaccines despite the fact that we have large clinical studies proving their efficacies a while ago. This is the same agency which has no problem approving drugs with few patients showing they are better than sugar pill. Hundred of thousands of lives were lost in the US due to Covid. With the opening of schools and reopening of our economy, we are likely to get another big wave of Covid within few months. Booster shots can save many lives. The hypocrisy of those misguided scientists (?) are stunning. Kudos to Dr. Fauci and NIH for doing the right thing. Hope a right decision will be made on Friday to protect many innocent lives."
2021-09-16 22:00:25,Booster shots are a good idea. They provide more protection for us older citizens when the Delta Covid virus is wreaking havoc nationwide. The efficacy of one’s initial vaccination is fading as all anti-virus shots will do over time. A Covid shot will probably be an annual event until this pandemic is put to sleep.
2021-09-16 21:44:03,This argument on boosters should be more private between the scientist so as not to confuse the public and/or give any more ammunition for anti-vaxers to use to justify not getting vaccinated in the first place.

As a retired public health worker, I've been shocked and disappointed continually by their hesitance and, in some cases, outright stupidity that can only be explained as yielding to political pressure.  

Their current divided stance in public, whoever is right, is an elementary mistake in the conduct of public health.  The only way a public health agency can be effective is with a consistent and reassuring message.  How many of those have we had from anyone but Donald Trump, who assured us that it was no worse than the common cold, and would magically disappear.  America's catastrophic case and death rate, still four times that of the rest of the world, can be laid at the feet of these public disagreements.

To be conducting scientific debate in public with less than complete scientific data is a recipe for public distrust.  By the time the reality becomes clear, when all the data are in, it's too late.  

Like nearly all public health professionals I've known, I took great pride in being part of a community of poorly paid, little known, underfunded people working hard for the public good.  It helped that, like Tony Fauci, they were mostly caring, humane individuals.    My disappointment in the American public health response to the pandemic is profound.

They have developed special double flue vaccine for the over 65 because the immune response was so poor to the common  flue vaccine yet the over 60 are suppose to be able to handle Covid without the booster. This is insane.
With all the knowledge of how poorly the aged immune system responds to any virus and all the work that went into getting better flue vaccines for the over 65 . Why is there any questions that anyone over 60 needs a third Covid 19 vaccine.
This is so simple a child could answer this problem.
It once again appears that the US gov. doesn'tcare about older people sufferring or dying prematurely.

My wife and I are both 79 and, after reading as much as possible on the subject and consulting our primary physicians, went to get a Moderna booster shot after six months of the second dose. As usual, it is always best to be very proactive about our own health!
I wish the administration had been more forceful on ALL aspects of this pandemic. You do not want to get vaccinated then stay home. You don't want your kids vaccinated then they will not be able to attend school in person. And demand proof of vaccination for all people who attend football games, concerts and any event with more than 10 people! That will slow down the pandemic!"
2021-09-17 00:55:33,"A commenter points out (correctly) that readers who say they've already received a booster shot must have lied to get it. True, but that's the way it's going to be. (For those who haven't already figured it out, one gets a ""booster"" shot by claiming never to have been vaccinated and thus receiving the ""first"" shot (really his third); to get just one booster, a recipient of the ""first"" shot (really his third) simply doesn't show up for his ""second"" shot (really his fourth). Result: three shots --  the first, the second, and the booster.)

Since many people will ""fake"" their situations, one must question whether any conclusions may still be properly drawn from any ""data."" Probably not, but conclusions -- based on fact or not -- will nonetheless be drawn. The better question: should we rely on those conclusions, or should we ignore them from here on out?"

For those who DO share the ""burden"" of not lying, fear not: Whether it should or not, the US government soon will decree that ALL American adults should get a booster shot. The ""third parachute"" argument won't even get made. And that, as they say, will be that. Whether by lying or because one's name appeared on some list, all American adults will receive a first shot, a second shot, and a booster shot, whether or not the dear people of Africa have received even a single shot.

2021-09-21 23:32:17,"In 1905 the Court ruled on the constitutionality of compulsory vaccination measures in Jacobson vs. Massachusetts. In upholding the legitimacy of compulsory vaccination, the Supreme Court compared the right to enact public health measures during an epidemic to the right of a government, any government, to defend its people from a military invasion. And they compared the right to compel individuals to be vaccinated, whether they wanted to or not, to the power to conscript the people in order to raise an army. These are very strong statements of public health authority. --  Michael Willrich, the Leff Families Professor of History, chronicled this period in American history in his award-winning book, “Pox: An American History.”"

But in fact it could have been done with enough will and effort, at probably no more cost than a few aircraft carriers.

I'm not into conspiracy theories but the gorillas got is somehow and humans seeing them at the zoo are suspects.

The leading theories of origination are bats, from a lab source, or pangolins, from a wild meat meat market.  Humans can get the coronavirus from pangolins without a mutation while the bat version requires a mutation.

In Australia, a small town ordered the execution of their rescue dogs after they tested positive for Covid.  Reminiscent of the opening scene of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" they shot them.

The world defeated various historic diseases -- smallpox and polio -- to name two examples, by  vigorously vaccinating world wide and attacking  residual outbreaks where they occurred.  It took many years. And it took vaccine mandates. The US, supposedly an enlightened wealthy country, has not yet been able to vaccinate huge fractions of the eligible patients  in many communities. Dealing with less affluent countries with a more primitive medical infrastructure is severely challenging.  But wide spread vaccination must happen globally, the US included, to quench Covid.   The US should serve as a model because we are nearly there.  We have the means.  We can vaccinate virtually everyone who can benefit, if only the holdouts will change their minds.  And we can bless the world at large by manufacturing and distributing vaccines for all.  Let us start, and entice other advanced economies to do likewise. And our holdouts?

Along with those who have never contacted covid and gotten the vaccine, the human body when exposed to covid does a fantastic job in most cases of producing antibodies, adaptive and natal, and memory B cells when exposed and in the end creating immunity. That is how the human body is supposed to work and in fact does. Instead of brow beating the hundreds of millions of people in the world to get a vaccine, we should have first actually followed 'the science' and tested people to see if they had immunity from previous cases. The CDC and Fauci at first argued that herd immunity would be a combination of vaccine and natural immunity and then as politics became the all important game, that clear eyed science fell to the wayside. Some studies show that immunity after infection is many times stronger than the vaccine and some studies show that vaccine is stronger than natural immunity or may in some cases boost immunity. But we should have done far more studies in this area, instead of creating an authoritarian group to force people to get protection they may in fact already have.

2021-09-22 01:59:35,"Sure, all we need is a world government with the authority to take things from the rich and give them to the poor. Including vaccine technology. I'm sure that would all work fine. History is full of success stories showing that."
2021-09-22 02:08:58,"""... public health officials say, more companies in more regions need to start making vaccines.""

There are reasons why vaccines are not being made in Africa. Come on. To build the infrastructure for storage and transport and to boost manufacturing there would probably take decades, if not much longer, with the level of technology and well civilization on the continent."
2021-09-22 02:17:38,"Getting sufficient amounts of Covid vaccine to African countries and then storing it and getting it into people's arms will be a Herculean task, although it's worth taking on, perhaps in somewhat limited form.  Unfortunately, the effort will undoubtedly be hampered by rampant corruption, theft, and profiteering endemic to many of these countries.

However, the proposal to provide the economic and technological infrastructure to allow African countries to manufacture their own vaccine is a pipe dream, pure and simple."
2021-09-22 02:19:55,"Wonderful, comprehensive discussion of the immense scope of complexities in equitable vaccine development. Even if greed miraculously disappeared from humans souls, there remains the reality of the lack of strong international institutions.

In evolution, it is widely accepted that cooperation was an early primate adaptation. However our early primate ancestors were also territorial and so hostile to outsiders. And this is out I Herman Edwards.

I grew up in the post WWII years and the subsequent unity of the Western victors.  Although the UN, WHO and NATO never overcame the domination of the donor countries, it seems their early decades were successful enough to give us hope. Certainly the Marshall Plan and the humane efforts in the defeated nations of Germany and Japan contributed greatly to world stability.

But evolution is not necessarily a straight line for any one family line, continuously rewarding its progeny. Environments change and it might just be the fittest among will prove to ants that have long figured out a genetically dictated social stability. Our free wills, science and arts have been crowning achievements, but also our undoing when survival depends on global cooperation.

Hoarding of vaccines, finding cause for boosters gives the virus the evolutionary opportunity to dominate us."
2021-09-22 02:20:32,"There has never been a moment when we were on track. 

Had airports been closed the day Wuhan announced it was building a hospital in ten days, a global pandemic could have been avoided. I had worshiped the CDC and WHO up until that point and I will never look at them again with the same respect. 

Every single book written about 1918 has a passage about how much worse it would have been had there been air travel. So as someone well-versed in pandemic history and literature I couldn't believe it when day after day  passed with no decisive action. 

Trump bears the brunt of the blame but there is no excusing the failures of the CDC and WHO. By definition, they function outside of the jurisdiction of/are not limited by governments. They could and should have curtailed travel immediately.

From that first epic failure we limped from mistake to mistake. And I write this even as school children everywhere are being forced back into classroom that have made NO accommodations or concessions for the pandemic. STILL no mask mandates, no vaccine mandates, no money for expensive overhauls necessary to ensure student and faculty safety. Many schools still lack windows that open, hot running water, temperature stations, or hand gel.  

It is unconscionable that we're experimenting with our children.  

This was a test for the coming storm. We've failed it spectacularly. Failed it in every way conceivable. We had better wake up fast and learn. The next one may not be nearly as benign."

While I'm no fan of Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte, his accusation of western nations selfishly hoarding vaccine resources is 100% on the mark. My elderly father lives there and he has no hope of getting even ONE shot any time soon. He was also just hospitalized for two weeks for Covid-19. 

Meanwhile in the US, people are only focused on me, me, me and how can I lie to get a booster shot? I've seen the shrugs and bored looks when I mention that billions of people still haven't had even ONE shot yet and there's no chance whatsoever of ending the pandemic by only making sure that a few countries get all the shots, even in the face of other countries saying THEY WANT TO BUY vaccines to inoculate their people.

Americans seem to not comprehend that ensuring only Americans get Covid-19 vaccines means the global pandemic will NEVER end."
2021-09-22 02:05:01,"So long as we got enough vaccines and boosters for everyone in our country, any surplus should be donated. Biden knows that there should never be any impression that US doesn't have enough for Americans first. It would not be acceptable otherwise."

But her report is in The New York Times, surely one of the world's most powerful corporate-owned, corporate-sponsored private news presses, so then I think to myself: What about the many decades past that have brought us to this monumentally deadly and catastrophic response to this raging global pandemic?  What about the multinational corporations familiarly known as ""Big Pharma"" that have over these many decades pumped billions of dollars into marketing, lobbying and ""press-releasing"" and sponsoring The New York Times and its many corporate-sponsored projects?

And now The New York Times hands us this ""We""

No, it's most emphatically not ""We""—rather, most emphatically, it's you and your decades of serving, promoting, & ruthlessly protecting the corporate-structured autocracies that allow the existence of this corporate-owned, corporate-sponsored private press that you handily define for the world as ""our free press.""

So, knock of this ""We"" nonsense, so that we the public can start to examine the crucial role The New York Times has played over these many decades and that truly has the rest of us in a ""fight"" that we did not bring on."

If population based-rates are taken into account using WHO country-by-country data since March 2019, the United States has a relative risk (RR) of 4.25 higher than the international rate (1.0). Europe as a whole has a relative risk of 2.62, and Canada 1.4.
Using the same RR measurement, India's rate is 0.84; Korea = 0.18, New Zealand is 0.03, and China's population rate is negligible.
These rates hold over both  the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine period. In other words, the most developed countries are the drivers of the pandemic.

So, this problem of so-called not knowing where things are, how many of certain things there are, and where, is truly not a problem. 

In 1983, there were more than 400 biotech - bioengineering or genetic engineering firms in one California GeoCode.  

That number has exploded.

In that statement Bancel laid his cards on the table.  He and his company were about making profits not about ending the pandemic.  

""We"" have not gone badly off track.  Profit driven corporations are tootling along on the money- making rail lines they laid at their inception.  At least Bancel was candid enough to tell us which side of the battle he and his company were supporting."

It reminds me of the container ship getting stuck sideways in the canal. For a week we got to hear pundits talk about how fragile the system was. And then everybody got their stuff.

I'm not saying things couldn't have been handled better. Boy, could they have. But on this level of planning and logistics, the idea that there's some great series of inadequacies and injustices...it starts to feel like muckraking not for the public good, but just for the sake of having something to say. And that tendency of the media is leading us astray again and again, whether it's on policing the border, fake debt ceiling debates or 20 years of supposed gains for women's  rights in Afghanistan.

It's easy to understand by all and will create a will around the world to vaccinate in huge numbers, similar to smallpox and polio. We've vaccinated the world before but if people don't think there lives will fundamentally change post vax then many, many won't take it or want it.

US politicians of both Trump and Biden administration, previous and current political appointees, and omnipresent Dr Fauci keep parroting that only vaccines can get us out of this mess - but it is clear that vaccines alone will not do the job. We are in this mess precisely because they did not want to recommend correct mitigations, implement them timely  and sustain their implementation appropriately. After vaccines became available, they flopped on vaccine rollout and lifted mitigations too soon, much too soon. Do not think for a second that the mess in which US finds itself now, in late September of 2021, is only attributable to the vicious Delta variant. Delta is now causing 99% of cases worldwide, but virtually all other industrialized nations have a much better handle on the Delta wave than the US does. Eventually, US will have to reckon with its mistakes in how it handled this pandemic and employ an integrated well-coordinated strategy to get the grip on SARS-CoV2. If it does not, it will risk having sizeable ""popcorn"" style outbreaks for next 10-15 yrs."
2021-09-22 04:27:59,"Jeneen Interlandi has clearly explained the failures of Covax and other factors that resulted in the unethical vaccine distribution, and the danger of worse variants.
Interlandi writes, ""Duke scientist Gavin Yamey told The Lancet, “rich countries behaved worse than anyone’s worst nightmare.”
Doesn't this show that Yamey has an incorrect view of government? If he had a correct view he would not have expected different behavior.
Studying poli-sci and the history of government, such as its killings of hundreds of millions of innocents, can clue us that it's not ethics-based.
(Notice that the proposed answer to this unethical distribution is to spread vaccine production to avoid hogging of vaccines.)
Such behavior of government is quite likely to condition its policy of global heating. We can already note that the rulers have embraced unethical Kyoto and Paris deals that have resulted in suffering and deaths -- we can expect this to get worse as the sequel of events will show.
A scientific view of government can lead us to rational expectations, instead of listening to propaganda and fantasy views of what it should or could do."

The Chinese vaccines have been validated in use around the world and by the WHO. Typical US self-absorption to think they need US ""validation"". What would be helpful however is if the US took their foot off the gas of the major disinformation campaign they are directing towards Chinese vaccines around the world attempting to denigrate them and decrease use. Not because the US is providing alternatives but because the US finds China's success at what the US media calls ""vaccine diplomacy"" embarrassing. It's not vaccine diplomacy. It's doing what needs to be done. Grow up America. Focus on something other than geopolitical competition with China when it comes to Covid. Whether the US media wants to admit it or not.

The Chinese have administered more than 2 billion doses of the vaccine. Of course, that has gone to their citizens, but once their nation is fully vaccinated, they have the fastest process in place to help other nations.

They have also been building infrastructure in the 3rd world, including highways, bridges, and hospitals across the African continent

The U.S. ought to think about what that means if the West sits back and lets China take the lead on global development.

While we've been bombing the world, China has been building in more than 130 nations.

What do you think that will mean for our future? Especially when we can't even get a basic infrastructure bill passed for our own country!"
2021-09-22 05:10:32,"There have been some comments about China's success in vaccination. But I am not sure their reading on China's vaccine push is accurate. Yes, they are able to make 2 billion shots, but that number should multiple by 0.5 because of their efficacy and the lack of trust. The Chinese people themselves don't even trust their own medicine. There are always two things in China: home made (translate: bad) and imported (translate: good). And this time, there is no difference. 

On a different note, if fighting covid is a war, the U.S. is the very front. We are holding the line against the enemy and need the most reinforcement (i.e., vaccine). So while there is an ethical concern about how vaccine shots are distributed around the world, if you look at where covid hits the most, would it really be a bad idea to make sure people are vaccinated in the U.S.? One can make the argument about this is a reasonable choice."
2021-09-22 05:21:01,"Important discussion.

The world is not set up to have a simultaneous vaccine supply chain and innoculation at the same time throughout the world , as well as produce seasonal variant Covid vaccines due to production capacity limits as well, also at the same time as needed.

The article hints at these barriers but simply dividing it into rich and poor countries doesn't tell the whole story. Parts of Europe had enough vaccine but no supply chain organization to distribute efficiently, causing the EU to fall behind the US in vaccine percentages for quite awhile.  This helps no one. You get asymetric variant vs non-variant whack a mole.

Anyway, what is the answer? I don't know. But I will say this; while the work that Pharmaceutical companies do is important and imperative, the set up and capitalistic nature is in no way optimal. The concept of a world government is impossible to see right now, but the concept of a world shared R and D and Pharmaceutical unified entity with many facilities world wide is something more graspable in which all countries of all sizes and economies would benefit if set up correctly."

Why can’t we try to be the physician, or the pharmacy to the world? During WWII we built a manufacturing machine for war in weeks to months of inconceivable proportion. Post-WWII we funded the Marshall Plan to assist others out of the darkness. We are nearing a year with these vaccines available. All of the obstacles mentioned in the article are surmountable. None are that daunting, other than getting the injections into arms all over the world, and even that is possible if the will is truly there to do it. 

And the will should be there to do it. Ethically and morally it is the right thing to do. Medically, leaving billions of people unvaccinated is a plan designed for failure. Politically, it would enhance our standing and respect in the world. And, if you want to just be capitalistic about it, an uninfected world is a bigger market to sell our other wares. 

It is time the US truly led in this arena. It is past time."

So far as I know vaccinated people can spread the disease, albeit at a lower rate, just like the unvaccinated. Why wouldn't the vaccinated also be a vector for new variations? 

This sounds like a new version of the abandoned idea that herd immunity is possible. Obviously vaccination has many benefits, primarily reduced hospitalizations and deaths. But pretending it solves all problems and will eliminate the Virus and its variants doesn't seem to be supported by the current science."
2021-09-22 05:59:47,"Producing the vaccines is straightforward. Vaccination rates in the developed world are well over 70%, and this was accomplished in 6 months or less. There’s plenty of vaccine available. 

The problem outside the developed world is not production and availability, but distribution by corrupt and ineffective local governments.  

The WHO is merely the voice of their political appointees, who understand quite well that factual analysis isn’t what their patrons want of them."
2021-09-22 06:20:23,"As one of the senior citizens who has already received a booster shot, I don't see how I would benefit anyone by winding up in a hospital, quite possibly dying, because my immunity has decreased significantly after my initial vaccination. My local hospitals are already full, and I'm in one of the more vaccinated states. What we need here in the US is not just booster shots, but widespread vaccine and mask mandates. Also a much larger supply of monoclonal antibodies.   We already have enough anti-vaccine people spreading Covid and possibly creating new variants, right here in the US. We need to sort out our own problems.  We also need to be working on new vaccines that will provide more protection against new variants.  The US is already donating doses, but it cannot be responsible for the entire world."
2021-09-22 06:21:52,"""The People’s Vaccine Alliance estimated in June that at the current pace, it would take 57 years for low-income countries to vaccinate their entire populations.""

Why, by and large, do the mostly unvaccinated countries have the lowest incidence of COVID disease presently?  Look at The Times map of current COVID hotspots and you will see what I mean.  Why is Israel, at 82% fully vaccinated and many already with third doses of the vaccines, one of the most infected countries in the world?  And why are the death rates there still approaching what they were when no one was vaccinated?

Yes, the vaccines we have now lower the risk of death, severe illness and hospitalization.  But I would strongly suggest that these vaccines are acting far more like therapeutic drugs in minimizing sickness, not eradicating it.  That is fine for a vaccine for diseases that are not communicable.  It appears if the entire world were 100% vaccinated with our current vaccines, we would still have a coronavirus pandemic - lesser carnage, but still rampant disease and, yes, death.

I think the question people should be asking is where are the next generation vaccines that have a real chance of actually eradicating this coronavirus disease and stopping the pandemic."
2021-09-22 06:45:51,"What's missing from the dialogue is the proposition that herd immunity may be achievable by infection, not by vaccination alone.  Or, more likely, by both avenues of immunity.   Ignoring natural immunity is a mistake."
2021-09-22 06:56:14,"This article seems to make many grievous mistakes.

First, the US has about 4.2% of the world's population, but according to recent statistics it has 14.9% of the world's COVID deaths.

That means the need in the US is higher right now.

Yes, COVID will be a huge problem in Africa eventually.  But one of the reasons COVID is afflicting the US now is that American citizens travel a lot, so they come in contact with large numbers of people that are possibly infected with COVID.

Most people in Africa don't travel as much.  So there is a time lag.  Just as there was a delay in the rise of COVID cases in Brazil and India.  After an initial period in which the US deaths were very high, Brazil seems to have caught up.

The second point is that the author most likely has no expertise in the technology necessary to create the COVID vaccines.  It seems to me that the mRNA vaccines may in fact be a huge advance over previous vaccines.

It is nontrivial to export that technology to third world countries that do not have the scientific expertise to do the sequencing (for example) necessary to design and modify the vaccine for the new variants that are occurring.  Moreover, I believe that Moderna and Biontech are indeed trying to set of factories in foreign lands to increase production of their vaccines.

Finally, Americans are dying at the rate of 2000 per day.

It is STILL A CRISIS here in the US.  We need boosters which are also necessary to treat the new variants!"
2021-09-22 07:47:18,"""The United States has untapped leverage with Moderna. The government helped pay to develop the company’s intellectual property and holds a patent on and contractual rights to it. ""

If this is correct, as stated by this article, that the the US owns the patents to the Moderna technology, then Biden's apparently radical idea earlier in the year of sharing patents required no agreement from any other nation. Yet the idea stalled because there was no consensus on this.

So, either this statement is false or, if true, the US is not acting in good faith. If it owns the Moderna patents, it should share the technology. There will be other obstacles to overcome, as itemized in the article, but this would be the first step in addressing the issue."
2021-09-22 08:23:29,Ambitious talk  from a country with the highest COVID numbers.   It is good to be available as a resource;  but those in need must ask for  help.   What might appear as benign neglect is real compassion - terra firma for developing nations to bring up their own strength and independence.  Overfunctioning  so others can underfunction is not good policy. Ideologies and responsibilities that we cannot live up to will only breed dependency and more contempt.
2021-09-22 08:33:04,"The world is truly watching.  If we cannot use the safe, effective vaccines we have created to bring the Pandemic under control, we will have no one to blame but ourselves."
2021-09-22 08:47:02,Look at the Covid deaths per capita.  The US is right to protect its population which has sufferred multiples of the deaths per capita than the developing world.  Equity demands it.
2021-09-22 08:58:43,"Money rules.  Profits must be made and protected.  Vaccines are just one of many ways to make money, like oxycontin, and the same business principles apply to both.  

Maybe this shouldn't be true.  But it is, and will be until we change the rules."
2021-09-22 09:41:02,This is an excellent piece of journalism. These strong undercurrents of vaccine manufacture and supply have turned pandemic protections and hopefully eradication into a slow game of whack-a-mole with inevitable mutations popping up where the virus is uncontrolled. The scale and scope of the problem of vaccine manufacture and supply is vast. Look at Canada with zero vaccine production capabilities. A wealthy country forced to piggy-back on its neighbors. Now compare that to countries without the ability to enjoy the kindness of strangers. If treated as a dry run for more devastating pandemics of the future a sense of urgency should be driving vaccine surge production today. We are far from being out of the woods with C-19. Well reported and well presented. This is the standard and quality of reporting that has been missing from the NYT for too long.
2021-09-22 10:00:00,"The original plan was flawed. Vaccinating 20% of your population is pretty much useless with Covid as we are seeing. Even before Delta existed if you look at populations where approximately 20% of the people were already infected, the rate of transmission was hardly slowed. By trying to vaccinate 20% you probably would protect the most vulnerable in countries which have strong governance. Many of the poorer countries wouldn't fall into this category and would simply vaccinate the rich. So we would end up with the rich vaccinated everywhere in the world, COVID rampant, and no normal citizens vaccinated. I am not sure that is better."
2021-09-22 10:08:17,The US would further its own interests by exporting as much of our vaccine doses as possible since tens of millions here refuse to be vaccinated.
2021-09-22 10:21:13,"The disunity between countries, particularly 1st world and 3rd world countries, is well defined in this piece. When the main premise of Covax ceased to be viable, 1st world countries engaged in a form of “trickle down” distribution policies. While not much is said about it, the storage requirements for the mRNA vaccines should have been highlighted earlier, and actions taken to develop the recombinant true vaccines earlier. But then no one really thinks about those sorts of things as being an obstacle in the US.

Having worked overseas (though not in Africa), and listened to the stories about the lives of people in India, Nepal, the Philippines and the poor Middle East nations, it always struck me how difficult things were for them on a day-to-day basis. Waiting for a potentially life saving vaccine to be available is probably just another in a long line of indignities they have to suffer, though this is one case where the proper efforts should have been made re inclusiveness."
2021-09-22 10:25:17,"""While the United States has bought enough shots to vaccinate its entire population three times over, most low-income nations still don’t have enough to give even first doses to their frontline health workers or older citizens""

2021-09-22 10:45:51,"The fastest way to get the world vaccinated is to insure that the countries that can produce the vaccines needed by the rest of the world are themselves healthy and not busy fighting the pandemic in their own house. If we let the pandemic rage in those countries in the interest of equity, third world countries will end up even worse off because production and generosity in the wealthy countries will suffer. A sick doctor can't heal his patients until he is healthy himself."
2021-09-22 10:55:25,"Listen to Frances Collins. He puts in perspective how much the U.S. is doing for other countries and why we can’t afford to slack off on our vaccination program.

Biden inherited a nightmare situation from a nightmarish president. The chaos of the former administration is still unfolding in horrific scenarios. We saw in real time how his non-leadership has brought us to nearly 700,000 deaths. Biden’s biggest mistake was promising the summer of ‘21 would return us to normalcy. The CDC was overly optimistic. Living in the South surrounded by Trumpies scorned, refusing  vaccinations, I knew this was wishful thinking.t this time. We need boosters - not more sickness and death."
2021-09-22 10:56:22,"It's at time like this, I appreciate American ingenuity and the big pharmaceutical companies who came through when we needed them. Resist the pressure."
2021-09-22 11:18:28,"The countries that can, produce, distribute and administer their own populations first. Any problem with that ? After their populations are vaccinated, they move on to produce for the rest of the world. The argument about creating new variants is moot, we produce a lot of vaccine but cannot even get our own population fully vaxxed. Then there's the issue with distribution and corruption. The administration of most of the WHO's programs is iffy, at best and the UN is basically useless. Technology transfer is the only viable way to get poorer countries vaxxed but because we are uber capitalists...that's not going to happen. Because of all these issues, Covid is here to stay and we will need those over-produced vax shots as boosters regardless of what the FDA says. We need to vax the world...but we won't."
2021-09-22 11:22:13,"Doing what needs to be done (and not just from Moderna) the technology for this needs to be opened up.

Vaccinate the unvaccinated freely throughout the world against a Pandemic; not doing so is just continuing where we are now, and will be again tomorrow.

We know the reason's why this is happening, what we are not doing is exactly what you say needs to be done. Change the program from out of the deep pockets currently running the program. And if government(s) intervention is needed so be it. Let the US take the hit on this one, we have big broad shoulders to carry this thru; what we don't have is pharmaceuticals, investors, cooperation."
2021-09-22 11:23:07,"Our 21st century economy is global and our problems are increasingly global in scale. But our 20th century systems of governance—nationalism and capitalism—are poorly designed to manage global problems. National interest prevails over global interest. Corporate profit drives what is done rather than collective welfare. Increasingly, corporations operate outside single-nation control, easily avoiding responsibilities and regulations they'd prefer not to accept.

If our modern way of life is to survive, we need to address the unsolved problem of governing a global community. I see no sign of us doing this or even of a will to do this. Quite the opposite, we seem to be retrenching into nationalism.  

This does not bode well for our future. A population of 8 billion depends on functioning global systems to support itself. Just as important, it requires an ability to address the global problems that afflict or are caused by that system. Climate change, other environmental degradation, pandemics, wealth inequities leading to the impoverishment and economic failure of whole communities and subsequent war and mass emigration are all problems we are currently unable to address. 

If we fail to address them—and address them soon—I fear they will drive our modern way of life toward rapid catastrophic collapse, resulting in suffering on an unimaginable scale and even human extinction.

You used to be crazy if you thought the end was near. Now you're crazy if you don't."
2021-09-22 11:32:06,"Biden should announce that all unused doses are going to go to those countries that need them and want them.  The thought that somebody else is getting something would probably cause some of the anti-vaxxers to demand shots for themselves, so it might help matters in this country.  
But such a gesture would allow the vaccines, which have a shelf life, to help the rest of the world and, as the article shows, that too would help the US."
2021-09-22 11:32:50,"Welcome to capitalism ! Hundreds of different countries each decide how to do their thing. Capitalism encourages taking care of 'me' first, seeing how much money one can make from an event. It's amazing that the world is doing as well as it is. Also, I lead groups on adventure hikes, where teamwork is stressed; and the first rule of teamwork is take care of yourself first, lessen the burden on the group. I read that one of the countries in Africa or Asia had a yearly budget of $1 per person for health. Like it or not, the wealthy nations have to shuck capitalism and take care of the poorer. Do the G7 nations have a spot in their budgets for healthcare for the poorer countries ?"

2021-09-22 12:01:17,"The trump and, now, the Biden administrations continue to play politics even during the COVID crisis, by maintaining and often, adding, cruel sanctions to smaller nations, hindering those nations efforts to secure COVID vaccines and much needed supplies. 
So, when Joe Biden makes his signature. 'look, folks' pitch about US benevolence, he is not talking about Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, etc, all which have been hindered in their efforts to protect their citizens from COVID due to US sanctions."
2021-09-22 12:12:16,"The covid thread will not be contained until the world community works toward coordinated solutions to an unprecedented degree. Competition for military and economic power must be converted into cooperation in the manufacture and distribution of vaccines and the sharing of scientific knowledge. But there is persistent danger that some companies will cling to their technologies to accrue more profits, and some countries will seek economic advantages based on their vaccination rates."
2021-09-22 12:29:03,The challenge of overcoming vaccine nationalism gives us an opportunity to set a whole new tone for post-pandemic economic cooperation. We need to invest in robust agreements for technology sharing. This is clearly NOT asking the U.S. to fall on its sword to save the world. I'd like to see a few less instances of the word 'equity' (which sounds like beating a path to the bottom) and more use of the word 'cooperation' (to optimize using the vast resources available).
2021-09-22 12:32:57,"COVID has won, it is here to stay for our children’s lifetime. Scary thing is this is just pandemic-lite. The wake up call that we failed to heed. We are not remotely prepared for a virus with a mortality rate above single digits, and if you don’t know its coming to have not been paying attention."
2021-09-22 12:38:48,"I’m increasingly convinced that the pandemic in America has been exacerbated and perpetuated not by a lack of intelligence but by a preponderance of ignorance. Too often willful ignorance. 

If we actually provided a basic broad education in this country, including in the biological sciences (an owners manual for human bodies), ignorance wouldn’t have stymied our initial response to the pandemic and the tools to mitigate it in this country - and we could now lead by example while turning our attention to assisting the rest of the world with their fight. So it doesn’t continue to go down like this when the next wave hits."
2021-09-22 12:43:13,We cannot vaccinate our way out of this problem. These vaccines are too leaky and could be fueling variants similar to how the overuse of antibiotics leads to more virulent bacteria. Natural immunity is the only way out.
2021-09-22 12:48:19,"Everything is done halfassed these days. Even wars are fought this way, so is it really a surprise that a pandemic would be treated the same cavalier way? Nothing seems to matter any longer. Too much effort is expended hating the opposing party and people. And it’s only politics! So what chance does anything else have?

The very fact that the wealthiest nation on earth has more than a quarter of its population flatly refusing to fight this virus is basically a surrender to the virus. Let it take who it must, seems to be their mantra. Until it’s one of their family, of course. 

Just tossing it out there, but I think this abject selfishness stems from only a fraction of the population ever having to serve. Past generations had conscription to some extent. That alone produces camaraderie. And it’s exactly that which is missing in society today. That, and basic civility and ethics."

the economy"
2021-09-22 07:00:13,"I’m confused.
The NYT is quoting Biden as saying the US has donated 140 million doses, which is more than all other countries combined.
But the EU (Ursula von Leyen) this week stated that they had donated 700 million doses to developing nations.

Clearly one of these people is lying, and doing so about a vital issue of global health and the economy.   To say nothing about the failure of these leaders to coordinate with one another to defend the same vital interests.

I for one know which side of the Atlantic to place the blame, and which person has a longer history of lying and misrepresentation, and it’s not in Europe.
But maybe a reputable newspaper could enlighten us?"

2021-09-22 07:46:58,"Bottom line
WHO dropped the ball on management of pandemics and rogue countries maintaining poor health standards in autocratic Asian countries that just gotta kill as many sentient non human creatures as possible. 
United Nations arm WHO has been in existence long enough to have known how to manage this. 
Another obstacle was the Trumpian GOPers and Putins agency over our entire “ body politic”. 
You go into detail but the final sentences of your last paragraph is all a reader and voter needs to know. 
We blew it big time and continue to fall short. 
I do not see hope , faith , or charity at the UN or at a decrepit WHO.
Trump was evil and continues his rantings thru his “death cult. “
Biden is dithering because he can’t make a firm decision and is a billionaire politician. He is a Washington Insider that usurped the Presidency from the ladies on stage. Helped by two mega money guys up there on stage he won. 
Won the honor of watching us in a civil war that never ended. 
Just remember we are dealing with “ Dixie dems” turned into racist white supremes Republicans. And northern republicans moving south to St. Petersburg to become Dixie dems. And Democratic Party has no relations to that muck that confuses our senses and survival now."
2021-09-22 07:52:15,"Lets begin by repeating what we were told by the FDA and CDC about a possible vaccine in early March 2020. ""It will be at least 18 months to 2 years at the earliest""......so lets just make believe the vaccine was just made available as its only been 16 months. Also how do we not use the UN general assembly to demand that we be allowed to find out where this virus came from and how this happened to the world. Also lets stop the argument ""what does it matter where it came form"" if you get hit by a bus or shot walking down the street most people don't say what does it matter where it came from. Oh yes it does so that we know what to improve or change going forward. The funniest of all is that if natural immunity is  strong that means republican (its ahrd to keep straight waht is democrat and what is republican) See what happens when the school systems fail we have put out 3 generations of people who can't even read at the required graduating level thought they have ben given the self esteem and confidence given their numerous reading trophies."

By logical inference, the unvaccinated are putting the vaccinated at risk.

I don't know how many times this has to be said for people, but I got it on the first go. Unvaccinated people are a threat to vaccinated people, sounds backwards.

So, when we here fully vaccinated movie stars, athletes and those of high social status admonish us to get vax'd, after they have fallen ill, post-vax, does anyone beside me say, ""Why bother""?

2021-09-22 08:28:09,"The headline ""We Have Gone Badly Off Track in the Global Covid Fight"" is incredibly misleading, since the entire article focuses solely on vaccine manufacturing and distribution. There is no mention of the total lack of understanding of the root causes of the origins of the Covid-19 virus. Was the virus the result of a laboratory mishap or a natural mutation? There is no analysis of the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts, such as lockdowns, masks, and social distancing. Without knowing the root causes of this pandemic, we are assuring that this will happen again."
2021-09-22 05:09:29,"I don't see profound failure:
Worldwide, over 100 vaccines have been developed, many in record time, and several highly effective.

Given the widescale supply disruptions worldwide, it would be advisable to vaccinate in order to achieve a semblance of 'herd immunity' in nations. 
The initial vax candidates should include biomedical 
supply workers and medical workers.

If Dr. Hotez's recombinant protein shot is proven effective,
it might be combined with an innovation suggested by 
President Biden's science advisor Dr. Eric Lerner -
administration via a skin patch."
2021-09-22 10:27:18,"Vaccinating the entire world sounds so noble, the only course of action that could end this pandemic, the medical professionals tell us.  The unvaccinated of course are the ones to blame, responsible for mutations even when the vaccinated are very capable of contracting and transmitting the COVID virus and its mutations.  What are the consequences of vaccinating the entire world for the corona virus?  In the poultry flocks of the world, mass vaccinations are given to chickens to control the spread of IBV (Infectious bronchitis virus) a corona virus.  Even in the face of this protocol, a condition known as False Layer Syndrome, a variant of IBV,  attacks the ovaries of the bird.  Could trying to vaccinate the entire world give rise to more virulent viruses?  Given  that the scientists cannot even tell you with any certainty the originations of these viruses how can they assert this is the correct course of action, even going so far as to mandate the shots."
2021-09-22 12:04:02,"As always, its always about the money.  Its about big business destroying smaller businesses.  It's never about health care.

2021-09-22 12:31:17,"CoV-Sar-2 is not at war with anybody, it simply be, exists, like the way we are being and existing.

We are at war with ourselves. With our selfishness and foolishness, unable to care for others and unable to see reality for what it is, we leave our doors open for the virus to enter. Even when our lives depend on it, we are unable to recognize that in a pandemic, there is no individual freedom, because the virus does not know ""rights"", it just simply go where it can.

People who intentionally politicize this and spread lies about Covid prevention and mitigation are not unlike murderers. They murder people with their falsehoods; or if we are to give them the benefit of doubts that they genuinely are not sure about a new vaccine, carelessness and laziness with seeking truths and facts."
2021-09-22 12:31:33,"It has completely off track in America after eight months of Biden. Suppose there was no Trump vaccine, America would have been worse than India after the break out of Delta variant. After Biden become president and with his all kinds of mandates, we have more covid cases and more than 275K deaths. That is even after vaccinating almost 200M. Lucky we had Trump as our president during the pandemic ."
2021-09-22 10:33:08,"Blame it on President Biden couldn't hide the fact the COVAX is dominated by bureaucrats and WHO Director just wants to sit on his high horse yelling inequality without making any sincere effort to lobby world leaders behind the scene.

China is not going to allow the West to vet its COVID vaccines. Why, it is still refusing to cooperate sincerely with the world about the origin of SARSCoV2 coronavirus. To be clear, I am no conspiracy theorist. I don't believe it is a bioweapon gone amuck like some right wing anti-China protagonists. However, was it accidental due to a lab leak? Conceivable but the only way know for sure is for China to come clean. But losing face is such a huge deal. So, accepting its vaccines being inferior is equally unthinkable.

Today, Pfizer just announces it will increase its donation to one billion doses. That is not a small amount. Alas, some of the donation from the U.S. to some Africa countries have gone to waste when these countries didn't have the infrastructure to administer the finicky vaccine. So, we have come a full cycle. Besides the sheer number of COVID vaccines, COVAX needs to get its add together to help to build out the infrastructure for not just distribution but also administration. What is the point of getting canned goods without can openers?"

Now I’m old.  I went without seeing my family members or anyone for a year, at least.  I read day after day about the dying and dead and the sick from COVID.  I can’t even visit with the 90 year old widow across the street who counts her days.  I see the kids across the other street trying to figure out what this world is - masks, home school, staying away from other kids and everyone? I’m very angry at most anti-vaxxers.

This mule-headedness when millions of people in India were getting sick and hundreds of thousands dying. And we are not even talking about finished product here! 
Yes, this was certainly not the only reason for the catastrophe in India - a poor country which also happens to be a vaccine manufacturing powerhouse.  But you can see the havoc such ""America-first"" brain-dead policies create. The result was a deadly mutation - the Delta - which was first called the ""Indian"" mutation.

The leader of this plan was a military man who was advised by many civilian leaders of that day.  It was one of the most successful plans ever used.  It seems to me that something similar is called for to coordinate the enormous task of saving the world.  The red lights of doom are blinking now and no one should feel safe.

The world is definitely getting ""dumber"" as we speak.  I always thought this was the case but now I have proof.

There are people available that want to do this work. What's lacking is organization, and capitol. Once the capitol is secured, the organization part will be much easier. There is no need for someone to be a health professional to administer a shot. I'm a nurse. People should be taught in a short course in the countries in need and be supervised by a fully trained health professional. Whatever happened to the Peace Corps? Don't we have organizations already active on an international level that could be coopted for this purpose? I think that yes, initiative will have to come from government, but private sector involvement could help and hasten the process. As a PR move, it would help the 3 billionaires enormously.

So we are not at war” and there is no international “government” that can provide a solution to this distribution problem. 

Our system of government is structured around ur economic system, capitalism and the free market. The doses offered to US citizens are not free and the corporations providing these doses are not doing so out of some altruistic motivation. We, the people, buy them and have funded much of the development. The corporations make the vaccines to generate profits and future market share.

I suspect these corporations would gladly sell doses to any other nation and that the corporations would gladly expand manufacturing capacity if a case could be made for a sustainable market.

I feel that the foundation of that attitude is why we have been unable to deal with this virus and why, as the author points out, we are losing this challenge as well. 

Governments across the globe and especially in America, have become so entrenched in political favor and payoffs that mere operational issues are difficult, let alone dealing with a real crisis. Our nation alone still refuses to allow inexpensive ""take-home tests"" to be manufactured and sold at a cheap price so people can regularly test themselves!

It is shameful to feel the need for a booster because two vaccines don't feel safe enough in states where governors' policies have resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths and decimated health care systems. 
Yes, we need to do everything we can to get vaccines to people who need them, regardless of where they live in the world.

As others have said the EU has donated around 740 million doses , and the UK as well as donating vaccine sells Astra Zeneca at cost , a cost which at around $4 a dose is well below the cost of other vaccines . So while we were short of vaccine at the time in Canada and used that supply in days ,and we are very grateful for that it did not help to supply vaccine to the poorest countries .

But when it comes to COVID the argument is those diseases are ""far more deadly"" and COVID ""isn't that dangerous"".

Prior to mandated Vaccinations the actual death rates in America were as follows:

Mumps: 500 American Deaths per Year on average.

Measles: 500 American Deaths per Year on average.

Polio: 2,000 American Deaths per Year on average.

COVID was killing that many people in America per DAY for a while there. We just crossed 675,000 deaths, the number lost to the 1918 flu pandemic and we are not yet done with the dying by a long shot.

The U.S. has announced, but not yet implemented, its border requirements, but Canada provides a good example. It started admitting Americans on August 9 and expanded to all countries on September 7. It requires full vaccination from a list of vaccines that it accepts, a Standard (not Rapid) PCR test, and testing at the border point on a random basis. These requirements are stiffer than those of all E.U. member states until a couple of weeks ago, when some E.U. members started upping theirs.

Canada has disclosed how many people who fulfil its requirements turn out to be positive. Based on the random tests that it does, it says under 0.2%. It considers this acceptable. 

The E.U., Canada and several other countries are issuing, or will soon issue, vaccination certificates as proof of entry requirements. These speed up border processing. In the U.S., only NY State offers an equivalent document (the Excelsior Pass), but I suspect that there will be pressure, from both U.S. travellers and foreign governments, for the U.S. to get onboard."

Why is the Central Republic of Africa not studied more robustly by WHO ? or the rest of the global medical and scientific community?  Is it truly an enigma?

There are a few NIH studies regarding Central Africa and Covid 19.

Why not establish a global Translational Research center and Clinical trials for a ""safe - affordable therapeutic/s""

Aristotle's thinking was particularly clear, if not disturbing: There were far more poor people in Athens than rich. Therefore the poor (and in Athens,, uneducated) would naturally run the country. 

China, though probably fully responsible for the start of the Pandemic, also managed to quell its severity in the early months. We probably see that in Russia as well, according to this article. 

In the United States ""freedom"" has meant the clear flow of politicized disinformation via Fox News and Republicanism in general. Much of the Republican base is willfully ignorant as a result. 

In our case, it seems, a ""true"" Democracy has led to a self-destructive cancer via a natural authoritarian decay in the face of the onslaught of Trump and the Republicans. 

I don't have a solution. But the world is suffering rule by idiots. I do think that is the center of all these problems. Democrats want Democracy. But Republicanism (the far right at this point in history) takes the ship of freedom and twists it into a monstrosity. The entire world is suffering the consequences of this."

In a rational world, the United Nations would create a single global agency, say the World Vaccine Organization, that would have responsibility for regulating production and allocating vaccines fairly to the entire global population. Obviously this isn't what is happening, because of corruption, stupidity, ideology, greed, and vast disparities of wealth and power between different groups of nations. But if we cannot solve this problem with a moderately lethal coronavirus, what is going to happen when a really bad one hits with 60% mortality, like the medieval bubonic plague?  Let us prepare for that now using the problematic current situation as our incentive to create an effective global solution.  Next time it may be too late."

Greater than 98% of those admitted to Covid wards/ICU's are unvaccinated. Medical staff are burned out/fatigued. There are less nurses and doctors available to care for this onslaught. 
Popping up monoclonal antibody clinics to save those who have developed Covid, but refuse the vaccines continues to be short-sighted effort. Monoclonal antibody treatments are expensive; Vaccines are free.
Yet, some U.S. citizens continue to believe in conspiracy theories, and/or are fraught by their politicized beliefs. The vaccine is not political. 5,980,985,575 vaccines have been administered world-wide as of today 9/22/21, this hard data  is in accordance with the John Hopkins coronavirus resource center.

Mo Ibrahim is right. Africa needs to boost manufacturing. Expecting countries, no matter their wealth, to vaccinate others first before themselves is futile and not worth the paper that all the naming and shaming isn't being printed on.

From this article: ""United States has bought enough shots to vaccinate its entire population three times over, most low-income nations still don’t have enough to give even first doses to their frontline health workers or older citizens. ""

The key the US is buying and funding these companies profits.

Where is the rest of the world's contributions to vaccinate the world?

Why is our country funding the 'war' on the pandemic and our companies only reap the financial benefits and profits.

One-hundred million (50 million people fully vaccinated) cost us $2 billion dollars in June2020; how much this time for 500 million(250 million people fully vaccinated) and does this include a third booster shot.

Title :  Run not Walk
The race to produce a vaccine for the latest coronavirus

""the rapid rise in cases of the Wuhan virus in China and its spread to other countries has created a new urgency: planning ahead for ways to make massive quantities of a vaccine quickly. There are not many factories that can mass-produce vaccines, so new vaccines often wait in a long queue. Aware of this problem, the American government has built dedicated manufacturing facilities that can produce vaccines rapidly for emergencies. Britain is doing something similar.

I have replied to that point to them.      Obviously the current business is not a true war, but to envision the threat as less than an absolute one until all the 'embers of the conflagration (metaphor here) are out' is to risk major problems.
There is rather little alternative to some continued vigilance and action in defense of a human survival.     The human species may not be killed off in its entirety, but sufficient damage to the remnants may impose conditions which are not at all reasonable to even consider.       A Pandemic ends when it does.     We cannot determine this.    Rather the behavior of the virus determines the end of the matter and we must make due until such a time as we can or be willing to suffer the consequences of our foolishness.  
From the standpoint of who wins; that I cannot answer.     I doubt that there is a victor here.      The virus does not care to win, only to survive.     To the extent that the virus should almost certainly come out of the Pandemic in some more readily tolerated form, humans can interpret that as they will.   It can be called a victory by many.    It can be considered to be a virus tamed by man in the long run.     Whatever the result, the end is probably to be some abandonment of any active 'combat'.

2021-09-22 16:15:33,"Not everyone in the United States is wealthy—far from it. And the poor in our nation have suffered from Covid disproportionately, with many still needing vaccines.  We’ve suffered more Covid death than any other nation in the world!  And, we invested tremendous resources to develop the vaccines. Much of that tax money came from ordinary, working class Americans. To portray the US as a miser sitting on a mountain of unneeded gold seems unjust to me."
2021-09-22 16:16:15,"Here is the key sentence in this piece: ""Transportation, electricity for cold storage, trained health workers for vaccine administration, and campaigns to combat hesitancy all need to be bolstered.""

Bolstered? There are parts of the world where for all practical purposes none of these things even exist. The idea that with just some more thought and effort, we can vaccinate most of the world's population, is false. Not that we shouldn't try, because as the author says new and potentially dangerous variants are likely to be created among the huge population of the unvaccinated. But even with the best will in the world, the goals the author speaks of are not fully achievable except in theory (or in an essay written for a newspaper).  Just because you have enough doses and a commitment to distribute them ""fairly,"" doesn't mean the job can/will get done."
2021-09-22 16:16:29,"Economic theory, which is almost entirely concerned with how to allocate scarce resources, ranges from pure capitalism through various blends to pure Marxism. I think it should be noted that the most effective vaccines were developed in countries with more capitalistic economies, showing the power of ownership as an incentive to work hard and fast. 

I do not hear calls for the rulers of many of the poorer countries to dip into their own Swiss bank accounts to purchase more vaccines for their people; if they are not willing to help their own people that says a great deal about the systems of government."
2021-09-22 16:22:13,"COVID will ""end"" the way the flu ""ends""- with regular booster shots.  102 years ago everyone was wearing masks to board trains and enter businesses, because there was no flu vaccine.  Now most (not nearly enough) people get seasonal flu shots and avoid any serious reactions to influenza.  And soon, most (probably not nearly enough) of us will be getting regular booster shots for COVID."
2021-09-22 16:22:50,"The rich countries (actually one when you look at the science) developed and manufactured vaccines never before seen in the history of the world.  That did not happen by chance.  It was by support of science and the proper investment climate to encourage the use of it.

The poor countries do not have that.  At some point, vaccines will be cheap enough to send to them in quantity.  At the moment, they don't have the refrigeration facilities to store them or even the medical personal to administer them even if they had them.

I think it is fortunate that scientists are not in charge of running companies, or no one would have anything."

2021-09-22 16:29:35,The way to do this is to distribute the vaccine for free AND protect reasonable profits for pharmaceutical companies.

The WHO states that EVERY year 8.9 million of just heart disease.  So while the 'existential' war on Covid is being fought out in a blind panic by people like Ms. Interlandi, 15 million people have died of heart disease worldwide.  That's just heart disease; every year about 55 million people died from all causes globally in 2019.  So, during the pandemic about 91.6 million people died from all causes, versus 4.55 million from Covid.

The Delta variant emerged in India.  India's vaccination rate stands at 15%, according to the NYT.  Reuter's reports that their current Covid new infection rate per 100,000 is 15.  Johns Hopkins shows India's overall Covid death rate per 100,000 is 32.62.

How do those figures compare to America?  Vaccination rate is 55%.  New case infection rate is 41.36.  Our death rate is 206.68.

We have an ex-President who lost and won't admit it. Probably the only thing we're not losing is faith, but faith and a dollar won't get me a decent cup of coffee."
2021-09-22 15:57:38,"The best to help inoculate the world is not by pressuring the manufacturers of the approved vaccines, but to approve a fourth American vaccine maker with a proven better efficacy profile and much less stringent storage requirements for its vaccines. That vaccine maker is Novavax, which has proven in clinical trials that its vaccine is 94% effective against the ancestral strain of Covid AND 90% effective against ALL variants of interest, including Delta. Granted, the company has been working though some setbacks in its production lines, but the finish line is visible in its effort to bring a new, better vaccine to the market. This vaccine will be the booster of choice, given its proven low side-effects profile and be the first vaccine in the arms of BILLIONS of people all over the world. They have already committed to selling 1.1 billion doses to Covax and are working with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture the vaccine at the tune of millions of doses a month. They have plants all over the world (South Korea, Spain, Poland, Texas, India) producing the vaccine and the current delays are related to the standardization of the production process. Definitely a company to keep an eye on."

We cannot expect the world leaders to orchestrate a world response to Covid when in our own country we have failed so miserably.

He needs to make it clear to Americans that the only way to end the pandemic is to get the entire human world vaccinated.  As long as other countries, especially poor ones, are mostly unvaccinated, they will continue to be breeding grounds for new  deviants.  The Delta variant which is ravaging parts of the US developed in India because its teeming millions of citizens are unable to get vaccinated.  Only the rich countries can solve this problem.

But surely, just a tiny fraction of the cost of the giant metal projectiles and chambers that deliver and deploy bombs.

At this time, we in the  US have a for profit medical system with parts of it hiding inside not for profit shells. Until and unless that changes world wide with real cooperation between all nations, it should not be only our obligation to subsidize poorer nations. Slowing or stopping this virus and it’s mutationsis in everyone’s interest. Also, as a lymphoma survivor with a perpetual weaker than normal immune system, I want that booster shot as I prefer to stay alive. With the strong number of anti vaccine plus anti mask and anti take precautions persons tempting fate and threatening me as well as encouraging further covid mutations, I want every  possible aid that allows me to survive and be involved in my community.

2021-09-22 17:33:32,"This article is muddling two problems (and their respective solutions): The SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 problem and that of the next pandemic(s). As to the first, building a vaccine industry in low and medium income countries from scratch will come much too late. The assertion in the middle of the article that this would be a matter of 6 month is wishful thinking. BioNTech, the inventor of the ""Pfizer-vaccine"", bought an existing vaccine plant near their headquarters, converted it to the mRNA vaccine (machines and retraining of staff) and got it certified - and they needed more than 6 month even under these circumstances. Guess how long it would take to do that now, say, somewhere in Africa. But that would be a possibility for the next pandemic - except you can't let such a plant sit idle for 20 years and expect it to work (think the Emergent disaster). Now what is BioNTech up to? They think about a plant in Africa and they intend to tackle a vaccine against malaria, to be produced there ...

In a summary: ""Open sourcing"" vaccines is not a solution to the short term problem (but probably a disincentive for long term solutions). Expansion of existing infrastructure at the location of existing manufacturers is probably the fastest *and* cheapest solution."
2021-09-22 17:39:55,"Future historians will remember COVID-19 as the Trump plague.  Trump’s denial and gross incompetence led to the deaths of half a million Americans, and he and his cult followers still refuse to take COVID seriously.
The only way to defeat COVID worldwide is to first defeat it in the US.  That requires vaccinating as many Americans as possible as fast as possible. Vaccines for children ASAP are essential.
This should be President Biden’s top priority for 2021.  After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.
Finally, President Biden should work with our allies and international agencies to promote long-term policies that ensure that the next pandemic never gains a foothold, anywhere in the world."

Covid Is Winning.""

But no, this replacement title is still totally disconnected from what this report is actually telling us, which is that the masses of the world are at ""war"" with U.S.-based Big Pharma and that these immensely powerful multinational corporations (interlocking with other immensely powerful multinational corporations) have the masses outgunned by the billions (of dollars).

The level of confusion over which venues accept my CDC card is legion. My public health dept lists me as unvaccinated. I am glad I bought travel insurance for an upcoming trip that probably won't happen. I knew there would be risks when I volunteered, but I thought it would be some weird rash or my arm blowing up.

The members of the US Congress are afraid to take a bold position on distribution of vaccines because they fear losing the next election, which would mean an end to their special life style. President Biden is not immune to this source of fear. 

Two thousand years ago a Jewish Rabbi from that squalid little town of Nazareth told his puny group of followers that if they give a cup of water to the least of these, they have done it for him. President Biden has chosen to follow that Rabbi. So he actually knows what he must do. And which member of Congress will condemn the Rabbi?"

Yet Covid has killed more Americans than were killed in all our wars.  Covid, its future variants and other viruses pose a greater threat to the US than Russia, China, communists and terrorists combined.  Biden should invoke his power to defend the United States and thereby spend whatever it takes to protect us by vaccinating the whole world.  The production of enough vaccine and delivery equipment should cost less than $100 billion, which is cheap compared to the cost we've already borne and infinitesimal compared to the cost of letting variants emerge among billions of poor, unvaccinated people."

Should've made it compulsory and just turn up at work places and jab people. Vaccinate people at supermarkets and places where everyone frequents, like churches etc. No jab no job, no entrence into where ever social activity. Covid cards like ID cards need to be issued as well when vaccinated just like you get your drivers licence renewed. It's not brain science. Use the processes that work well in the world, now, to get everyone vaccinated. 
Also, there was no vaccine for children and they can catch and spread the virus just like adults do. Don't forget that young people get older and they will be suseptible to dying just like the elderly do now, at this moment in time, because of them being in the most vulnerable group.
USA last govt has a lot to answer for and now this government has to try and fix the problems created by the last govt and those processes take time to fix.

The real story is that this is a public health crisis, and, like any crisis, this crisis will create great winners and great losers, as those with the ability to do so will exploit the vulnerabilities exposed by the crisis. To the extent that government can be helpful here, it is by tempering the extent of the exploitation. For the most part, in my view, governments have done a poor job of that so far.

2021-09-22 19:26:54,"The vaccine itself is not bottleneck - production capacity currently in place will produce approximately 12 billion doses in 2021 - enough for 70% of world population.  ""Don't give boosters in the US"" until other countries catch up will not solve any problems.  I will happily pay the $25 cost of my booster's production and my local CVS pharmacist is not going to shut down to go to Africa.

At age 9 in 1959 after a particularly rough decade of deaths and paralysis from Polio, we mobilized as a scout troop in Kansas and passed out sugar cubes with Polio vaccine serum to hundreds of folks waiting in line to get them.  We all lost someone.  My family, my oldest male cousin, and we all saw the paralysis, my aunt, best friends at school and so many others.  When the miracle of vaccination for this came along, no one protested and no one said ""its a government conspiracy""!  We were just so relieved to stop the deaths and injuries. Yes it was new and not fully appreciated, but it saved so many lives.  I just don't get the reaction to another miracle of science, hard work of humans and vaccination relief going on now.

Malaria, HIV, Covid. Lots of other things like TB, Ebola, and lots of other nasty parasites and viruses in Africa. Will they ever be able to fend for themselves and not rely on the largesse of foreigners, even if their is a self-interest component to communicable infectious diseases? 
Probably not in the near future, we're talking about a continent that really has never been able to provide for its own citizens while their population keeps doubling every two or three decades. And the UN predicts they'll go from one billion to two by mid-century as a given fact, as though that's in any way sustainable. 
Oh and the irony that Covid just might have started because increasing numbers of humans means encroaching into previously untouched wild areas, where there are many more nasty viruses awaiting our ""discovery."" Particularly in Africa where the lethality of hemorrhagic viruses makes Covid look like the sniffles from a common cold."

They didn’t “scoop up“ the supply, they placed their bets all over the table, not knowing for sure if any of them would pay off. Luckily, most of them did. Don’t frame this as a craven attempt to monopolize the supply.  The choice was to pay in advance or wait years for development. Poor countries couldn’t afford to pay in advance. 

Other than that, great article. We need to have a global reserve of vaccine manufacturing  capability for the future."

2021-09-22 20:13:19,"As is pointed out by another comment, the problem really isn't production so much as distribution.  Distributing anything into under-developed countries is always problematic.  Something as simple as food often ends up rotting in sheds or on docks.  Something as complex as a vaccine that requires super-cold storage throughout its distribution cycle would be almost impossible in many of these countries. 
The authors suggestion of just sending large quantities of vaccines to countries who have shown time and again to be too underdeveloped and too corrupt to even distribute food would simply result in the wasting of millions of doses of the vaccines.  The distribution of these vaccines cannot overcome all the structural issues that thwart almost any effort from the outside to improve the lives of people in these countries.  To believe otherwise is simply naive."
2021-09-22 20:10:36,"Covid was foisted on the world by the Chinese government's outright stonewalling and lying, preventing other countries from stopping Chinese travelers unwittingly carrying the Covid infection around the world. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has done this. They did it in 2003 foisting the SARS epidemic which was less contagious but more deadly.  At that time, they promised that they would not hide a potential epidemic disease from the world and would not lie about it as they had done allowing the disease to be carried around the world. This time with Covid was no different. The government arrested the doctors who sent out warnings about the disease. They threatened everyone and demanded silence while they grossly lied to the world about the epidemic. They claimed 41 sick people were hospitalized from a non-contagious disease originating in the Wuhan animal food market. At the same time, Wuhan hospitals were overrun with Covid patients and people were dying in the streets. Where is the pressure to make China pay for this horrible disaster?"

Does it automatically provide health care professionals in Third-World countries to administer the vaccines you have magically been able to preserve for use? 
People in advanced countries are being made to feel guilty because they're vaccinated and thinking about a booster. But the fact that I can get a vaccine has nothing to do with whether someone in another, less advanced country can get a vaccine. I'm not stealing it from anyone."

Corporations refuse to maximize production for lack of evidence they constitute “sustainable” markets.  Having scarfed up hundreds of billions of dollars they turn their noses up at more.

It’s not they fear losing money or breaking even in service to the survival of mankind, it’s that they want more.

Guaranteed a king's ransom (wait… I thought these geniuses of commerce are all about the risk), these corporate boys withhold life itself to squeeze the last penny.

Not just easily dismissed African or Asian life, this philandering with COVID threatens richish white guys, too.

Here in America we approve.  This is the best evidence the free market is alive and well.  Until new, improved, super uber COVID sets in.  Which it will.

It’s not they fear losing money or breaking even in service to the survival of mankind, it’s that they want more.

That’s small beer, though, compared to the fluffy cowardice of our politicians and policy makers.

With our lives literally on the line and, more important, our economy at risk they focus on perfecting taking political dives.

2021-09-22 20:55:48,"""But if current trends persist, very few of those shots will reach the poorest countries with the greatest need""

But why should current trends persist? With more people in the rich countries being vaccinated everyday, soon the majority of vaccines produced will be directed somewhere else. 

My home country, South Africa is currently at just under 14% vaccinated and all the reports that I get is that there is now plenty of vaccine available but not that many takers.  The government recently lowered the age limit to anyone over 18 which is almost in line with where we are in the US, and yet there are no line ups or pushing for appointments to be vaccinated. 
Rather that overwhelming poorer countries with vaccines, we need to be helping them with infrastructure to store, distribute and administer the vaccines and the time to do that is now."
2021-09-22 20:48:17,"You know if Pfizer & Moderna would have forgone their profits & used them to instead create more vaccines & to donate them to other countries then there would be no crisis!

This translates out to nearly 1/4 million more doses of vaccine needed daily for those reaching the minimum age to be vaccinated in addition to the amount of vaccine needed a day before.

Perhaps it's past time for the US to also start funding women's health and education around the world and furnish free birth control and on demand abortion services to the countries in need of help in this matter. There are not infinite resources on our planet to maintain this expanding mass of humans. We're already 6 billion or more past sustainable.

I appreciate the republican efforts to reduce their numbers by denying this coronavirus as a hoax or refusing to get vaccinated or wear a mask. Most of those dying in the US hospitals from Covid-19 are republicans who refused to wear a mask or get vaccinated. Each death means one less republican vote. It seems odd that a party and their media are taking this tact of killing off their own by feeding them disinformation while being so focused on telling women what to do with their bodies. Maybe they figure forcing a woman to have an unwanted child will increase the chances that child will grow to be an even meaner adult and would be an upgrade to the adults and children dying from not getting vaccinated."

You're darn right they did. That guarantee of purchase, at risk, before anybody knew the vaccines would work, was exactly what enabled those companies to forge ahead with highly expensive clinical trials and manufacturing of products on such an ambitious schedule.

He still won’t get vaccinated, citing the lack of FDA approval, and discourages other family members from getting the shot. Instead he suggests that we stock up on ivermectin, despite the fact that it is specifically *not* recommended by the FDA.  That, of course, is part of the medical conspiracy.  The one person he won’t discuss any of this with is his wife, who is… get this… a doctor.

The most touted report with Hector Carvallo as the corresponding author has listed participating hospitals that either deny participation or appear to be defunct (no working websites or phone numbers). The math doesn't add up (""we are not statisticians"", explained Dr Carvallo).

As a recent letter to Nature Medicine Lawrence, J.M., Meyerowitz-Katz, G., Heathers, J.A.J. et al. The lesson of ivermectin: meta-analyses based on summary data alone are inherently unreliable.

It is an efficient way for veterinarians to treat livestock and perhaps dogs for internal parasites, but humans who are taking this to treat Covid really need an education into the purpose of this pesticide. Or let them have it and bear the consequences and let's find alternatives for dousing livestock, horses and dogs with Ivermecting with something less harmful."

2021-09-28 13:25:08,"In the 1950s, Mark Clifton and Frank Riley published a novel “They’d Rather Be Right” which won a Hugo Award. To reduce the story to its essentials, they wrote about a cybernetic device that was programmed with all proven facts and the ways they were interrelated. (This is, of course, fiction - the story turns on this basic “what if” idea.)

The device could use a kind of mental therapy to rejuvenate people by removing all the tensions in their minds that were affecting them down to the cellular level. The catch was this. The process only worked if the subject was able to give up beliefs that were wrong in the face of provable facts - and thus a source of conflict with the real world.

Seventy years later we still do not have such a machine - but we are seeing people dying because of what (and who) they choose to believe in the face of actual facts.

Although the book is dated in some respects, it is eerily prescient in others: government teetering on the edge of censorship and thought control, power-seeking politicians, rumors transmuting into ‘facts’ through social interaction, conflicting opinions from experts, manipulative media, a problematic billionaire industrialist/philanthropist with his own agenda, conflicts in academia over what is acceptable… and a small group of unlikely heroes trying to make it all come out right.

This phenomenon is not uncommon, but like so many other issues of late it has been politicized to assail disfavored groups via cartoonish anecdotes and relentless invective. It is a subject almost perfect for platforms like Twitter and the NYT comments section where mobs congregate to share extremist opinions which outweigh thoughtful analysis by 10-1.

The safest course is to get vaccinated, thus for most, avoiding the need for ""treatment"" of any kind via immunity to the virus or its symptoms.

Almost all forms of do it yourself ""medicine"" are unwise in most circumstances.

As but one example, the current craze over the unproven ""benefits"" of CBD does not attract nearly as much online ""anti-science"" invective because many of the most extreme commentators railing about Ivermectin are proponents of CBD ""treatments and cures"", also with very little valid research support.

When will Americans demand that their media act responsibly and not just use their platform to report the obvious? If you are going to report the deaths and illness, then at least raise the question or responsibility! This is how we ended up with Trump and why we face the challenges to our country today! If this guy Rogan were telling people to kill themselves or someone else, that would be a crime. Yet, he is allowed to use a Podcast to tell people to take this drug and is allowed to do so!

What’s really scary is that for horses, ivermectin frequently comes in formulations mixed with other dewormer medications to provide a broader spectrum of coverage, and those are all sold out, too. (Hopefully they’re just being purchased by horse owners who aren’t left with a choice, but I’m not betting on that.)

This month I had to give my horses moxidectin, a slightly different class of dewormer. At least I have options, and I just have two horses, but a dose of  moxidectin costs about six times what I usually pay for ivermectin.

What we are seeing is partially the effects of trickle down economics as opposed to far right conspiracy theories.  The promising hydroxychloroquine research that Trump supported was a communication error.  Henry Ford Hospital system in Detroit performed the research.  The doctors, medical researchers, hospital administrators and a majority of the patient pool were Black.  The liberal media attacked the Black medical researchers citing research from white people in the UK done on a white patient pool that was less than 6% Black.

While Africa is waiting for trickle down economics to allow them to address the virus outbreak the same way that countries with vaccines do, they are improvising.  They are using the Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.  

More research by white people should be done to determine why Black people in their own countries are have better virus outbreak numbers than white countries do with their vaccines.

""A number of large-scale randomized clinical trials [of ivermectin] are underway that may provide a clearer picture. In August, the National Institutes of Health began testing the drug on people 30 years old or older who test positive for Covid-19 within the previous ten days and have at least two symptoms for a week or less. Shortly before that study launched, another trial on 1500 patients found no benefit from ivermectin.""

No need to demonize or ridicule people who are looking for treatments.  There is very little evidence that expensive and burdensome Remdesivir, for which:
""On Nov. 19, the World Health Organization recommended against using remdesivir. Based on a global randomized trial, they concluded in February that remdesivir had little to no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19.""

I agree with the Times characterization that it is (as of August 2020) not promising, 

I am personally pro vaccine and have gotten two doses plus a booster.  And view Covid as a global pandemic and not primarily part of a US political narrative. I'll wait for the results of these pending studies are complete before before declaring it ""settled science"".

The question whether it works or not is in that context in my opinion irrelevant. 

As for those medical studies that show it doesn't work: there are also studies that do show effect. In a world that doesn't have effective medicines that should be a signal for further study, not for a ban."

2021-09-21 09:32:41,"Repeat after me: '' The pandemic is not political. ''

If we have a threat to our existence, then we do all in power to prevent it. That could go for a meteor hurtling towards earth, a pandemic that will cut away at society regardless of political stripe, or climate change that will evaporate the water we need to sustain ourselves. (well maybe we don't do ALL in our power)

The point is that if you are rushed to hospital with life threatening injuries, then the doctors wheel you into the operating room immediately. They don't check your political voting card, and they don't check if you can pay. (at least at that moment) They don't care if you do not want the treatment and will go about saving you. (unless you have a do not resuscitate order)

This is where it gets tricky, but the other point is that we are dealing with you and you alone. If you are contagious with something, you will be quarantined. If other people come in contact with you, then they will be quarantined as well. Cost, and freedom and any other thing is not a factor. 

With this pandemic raging, we are all walking around as a possible threat to ourselves and to one another. To flout the odds that you may be infected, infect others, and then in turn perish goes against the principal of above. It is black and white.

It is not totalitarian to want to survive, and treating anyone in that light only signifies how much you value said life."

I believe there is a threshold of ""badness"" where  the political gets pushed aside and it really is ""the alien invasion"" moment where we all band together. For now, the pandemic remains a distant issue; many of us still have no close relatives who have severely suffered or passed away. 

Thus, let's hope the ""weird politics"" of this do not go away. If they do, then we are likely in a life-and-death existential fight with an even more sinister virus which can avoid vaccines and whose efficacy is strong against all ages."

Since the left position is more ideological (it only has ""ideological"" consequences), in the sense of ""ok, let's admit that a lockdown is a practical solution even though it smells like 'authoritarianism'"") it is easier to suspend, that the right-wing position, where the business are clearly hurt *on the short term*. And hurting the inalienable right of making good business is as unacceptable for the right-wing neoliberalism now as it was 18 months ago.

That's probably a good idea.

In NYC, you can eat out at a restaurant if you can show *proof* of vaccination (vaccine card).  In GOP-led states, wearing masks and getting vaccinated have been persistently downplayed.  Comparing these two approaches is simply false equivalency.

We need to get as many people in the US vaccinated as quickly as possible.  That's the Biden administration's strategy - and it's the right one.  Along with that, we must impose robust restrictions on international travel: if you're not vaccinated, you're not traveling (including into the US).

In parallel with these steps, the US should be manufacturing and distributing as much vaccine as possible to send to all the countries that desperately need it - because the pandemic is clearly a global problem.  The Biden-led government is working on that (despite some initial setbacks).

This is our best way out of this disaster.  But if you insist on pointing fingers right or left, Republican states have been the problem with enforcing mask mandates and vaccinations (the blue northeastern states have been doing the best on that, by far), and Biden is the one who has mandated vaccinations or weekly testing for most Americans.

That is really where we are.

That is reality."
2021-09-21 10:05:53,Ross I can sum it up this way. Early in 2020 I came to the conclusion you could have public health or an economy but not both at the same time during a pandemic. I asked a couple coworkers which of the two will Trump chose? All after a moment of thought replied the economy. Trump chose the economy because polling told him it was the only area voters gave him an advantage over his rival and by default republicans chose the same and still do but now for the reason that Covid surges hurt the economy. We have more sickness in our society than the Covid virus.

 In Foucault's conception, in the modern state system the most effective exercise of power even ""biopower"" are diffuse and  hidden, limiting the possibility for collective resistance. 

A focus on overt and authoritarian public health measures is a misunderstanding of Foucault's concept of power.

I work in the healthcare industry.  For example, many employers have started requiring employees to complete Health Risk Assessments where you have to send detailed information about your health history or pay higher insurance premiums.  This is a very Foucaultian form of power. 

It isn't that the the left has abandoned a concern with power.  It is that we fear corporate and religious exercise of power and we fear politicians becoming a mere mouthpiece for corporate and religious interests.

2021-09-21 10:11:26,"At the beginning of the pandemic, our conservative Treasurer sought advice from John Howard, a conservative former Prime Minister. Mr Howard advised that “There is no room for ideology in an emergency” The conservative government released huge payments to allow people to survive lockdown, stopped people from leaving the country and imposed strict entry controls-all against the conservative grain. Australia weathered the early stages of the pandemic better than most.
My point: If there is no room for ideology in an emergency, why do we make room for ideology when there is no emergency?"

All of the lefties I know have been following one type of authority--and that is the science.  And during this crisis the science has led to modifications in what can protect us, but has basically been shown to be valid. 

I have seen no ""flipping"" among people who might be considered on the ""left"" (we view ourselves as being centrists, by the way).  We have remained true to the data which have been shown will protect ourselves and others.

We have had to make sacrifices.  It's been hard.  But we are alive, and we, and our families, will know forever that those sacrifices saved the lives of people none of us will ever even know.

It seems very possible that the mask/no-mask war and all of the other pro/con positions having to do with Covid, may not really be about Covid at all, but rather about a need people feel to be a part of one cultural group or another, and for their group to establish hegemony over all others."

Actions are rational or not.  Rational actions are more likely to lead you toward your desired result irrational actions are less likely to do so.

What the desired result is (or should be) is open for discussion.

To date 1 in 400 Florida residents has, died from Covid.  That number is astonishingly high to me however, if that death rate is OK, then the folks who developed the menu of choices and actions mandated by the FL Governor did the right thing.  If however, you would prefer a different outcome, then make different choices and take different actions - including those you make in the voting booth.

But I think the ""left's"" pre-pandemic distrust of behavioral regulation of government may stem in part from the experience of years of the ""war on terror"" when our government contravened our liberties in all sorts of ways in the name of ""safety"" and took steps that indeed hit some marginalized groups especially hard.

And so in light of that experience, a certain level of skepticism about government coercion has been well warranted. But the pandemic is an example of a REAL threat to our safety, not a partially-contrived, or at least greatly-exaggerated, one as Bushian ""global terror"" proved to be..."

This is not a “maybe”, it’s the basic fabric of US politics, which was embedded over the two hundred years before Jackson and hasn’t evaporated in the two hundred years since. The elites have no option but to align with one side or the other, and then take it to extremes.

2021-09-21 11:01:09,"Or, just maybe, it's because ""the left"" was responding to reality as it presented itself and ""the right"" was already caught up in authoritarian Trumpism and continued to accept reality as dictated by their cult leader.

Neither side was as monolithic as Douthat seems to think ""the left"" was. Interesting that he allows for some nuance in the several positions of ""the right."""
2021-09-21 11:04:47,"I 100% agree that there is much to learn from these instances in which the left and right switch sides on an issue.  There are others.  One hundred years ago, Republicans led on many environmental issues.  60 years ago the polarity of support on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was almost the opposite of what it is today.  
 It sometimes seems like belonging to one political wing or the other is more about conforming to that wing's orthodoxy than thinking issues through independently from some set of first principles."
2021-09-21 11:21:00,Sociologists have long espoused that we developed certain long-lasting habits out of working closely together back in the early days of humanity’s ascent on this planet.  It really goes to show you just how toxic the Trump administration was.  It curbed millions of years of evolution and specifically promoted selfishness over cooperation in the face of literal death.  Being selfish is not how we made it this far up the evolutionary ladder  and if we don’t start acting in a cooperating fashion this might be the wrong turn that puts us in the soon to be extinct species list.
2021-09-21 11:21:20,"I think there is a simpler answer that starts with the old question, if you push on a wall, how hard does the wall push back? The simple answer is that the wall provides and equal and opposite force. In Covid, the left has pushed only as hard as the right has opposed the restrictions but the results are uneven. By not having a consistent and lasting approach to masks, distance and vaccines we have let the pandemic fester and by now it should largely be in the rear view mirror. Finalizing the pandemic, at least in North America is a matter of everyone masking, distancing and vaccinating for 4 to 6 weeks. That we can’t do this gives the lie to both our liberal and libertarian instincts."
2021-09-21 11:26:40,"The GOP has rapidly transformed into a Trumpian death cult. This transformation has been extremely enthusiastic. We had Republicans with Covid symptoms refusing to get tested because they didn’t want to “hurt Trump’s numbers.” ￼Watch the footage of zombie hoards attacking the Capitol on Jan 6.

The discussion we should be having is in regard to the causes of mass-delusion driving the Trumpist movement (other than Trump himself). I’m betting it has a lot to do with the extreme wealth concentration that has taken shape since 1980."
2021-09-21 11:31:58,Sounds like a good time to re-examine your definitions of ideological and political 'right' and 'left'. You should also revisit whether the right/left sorting is based on principles or just group identification and secondarily economic interests.
2021-09-21 11:32:17,"There's a gender component to this.  Not the genders of voters, but the way that the restrictive laws are implicitly coded as male or female.

If you don't believe me, look at the term ""Nanny state,"" which was often used during the Bloomberg soda wars, and looms over the current arguments.  Liberals support restrictive laws when they are coded as female.  So you'll read analyses arguing in favor of anxious worrying, taking especially restrictive stances on children, and dismissing individualism, which in this setting is coded as male.

On the other hand, the girls dancing past guards playing cards scene flips the gender roles, which is why that was considered a liberal-style text.

The male/female coding of conservative and liberal politics is nothing new, but it may be surprising to see that it works in both directions, and female-coded positions BECOME liberal, for that reason."
2021-09-21 11:32:54,"There's nothing odd at all about it because people don't have logically consistent ideological positions Mr. Douthat.  The ""libertarian "" right wants to ban abortion,  ban prostitution and ban drugs while the ""progressive "" left has no problem making poor peoples lives harder by burying them under burdensome levels of bureaucracy like insisting hair dressers be licensed or requiring city permits for everything. 

The nation isn't at all ideologically sound on either end of the spectrum.  You included sir, though you're at least sometimes aware of your heterodox  positions. Though you seem blissfully ok with the intolerable paradox of your dualistic  religion that somehow accommodates free will at the same time it has an omnipotent deity that knew everything I would do in the womb.

The only consistent demarcation between left and right took shape in the French Revolution.   The left generally wants to take power from the aristocracy and give it to itself while elevating the wretched to the status of lower middle class while the right wants class position frozen in time.   That's the entirety of the consistent ideological positions.  Everything else is easily adapted or discarded in pursuit of those goals.   There's no actual intellectual honesty or self insight.   No search for logical coherence.   It's still only the French Revolution.   Each issue only useful for its utility in that fight.   That's all of it sir."
2021-09-21 11:33:06,"The article is a complete and utter misnomer. Politics around covid have been anything but weird with the exception of course of the populist movements who for all intents and purposes have put their lives in the hands grifting politicians & civic leaders. 
If we manage to survive the climate crisis, future historians will look back on this period with incredulity. The question they will want answers for is how did so many people fall prey to what are little more than snake oil salesmen, peddling their lies and misinformation about a public health crisis?
The constant political framing of Covid-19 has already ensured a death rate that exceeds the Spanish Flu of 1918 - 1920 and there still isn't light at the end of the tunnel.
It would be very constructive for people like Mr Douthat, who concedes that restrictions actually work, albiet after the deaths of almost 700,000 Americans, would use their pulpit to encourage the naysayers to do what most of the Western World has done, get vaccinated, wear masks when applicable and most importantly, follow the advice of public health experts!"
2021-09-21 11:36:26,"It’s really unfortunate that pundits never point out that right wing governors like DeSantis and Abbott, who decry vaccine mandates as tyranny, preside over vaccine mandates in their own states that require schoolchildren to have the polio vaccine and several others.

2021-09-21 11:38:27,"Ah if only Mr Douthat could apply a scintilla of his considerations of multiple interests to the abortion issue where he advocates for absolute protection of the fetus and dismisses choice except as a political and intermediate compromise for some cases.   

Yet when tens of thousands of lives are snuffed because of political choice we have to entertain nuanced considerations of all sorts of abstractions.  If ever there were a pro-life position it would seem like this is it.  DeSantis Abbott and others are murdering people.  That’s a non-nuanced fact."

And every day 2,000 people die of Covid.  Do the math 2,000 x 365 and you will see what could happen as there are still millions of unvaccinated to go.  But keep telling yourself ""This will just peter out"" just like   ""15 , soon to be zero"".  But you don't know that for a fact.  Trump didn't know that.  Well, actually he did, but he didn't share that with you.  And the experts are all trying to hit a moving target.  Moving because many don't WANT the target to be pinned down.  They would rather win the culture war than beat Covid.  And think of all the Republican politicians who are more than willing to let lots of people speed on through the red light, no matter how much damage they do, as long as they can say they let you be free.  And you will vote for them again.  Sacrificial lambs at the altar of Trumpism.  And just think where we would be at (and the numbers bear this out) if everyone had gotten vaccinated.  Deaths at a flu like, manageable level.  People going about their business.  Hospitals and medical workers given the light at the end of the tunnel.  But, no,  you are waiting to reelect Trump so that in the bottom of the 9th, with the pandemic waning,  having dragged out American society in a cold, brutal few years, he can say he, alone,  won the game."
2021-09-21 11:43:22,"I don’t understand why the argument needs to be political. Left vs right and so on. It’s about believing scientific experts and following their advice on what we should do when confronted with the virus vs not believing experts and clinging to some other ideology based on ones own experiences, beliefs and values."
2021-09-21 11:50:33,"I think it helps to understand the different stances if you make an analogy to climate change. For the left, it’s we’re all in this together, let’s sacrifice a little to get a better outcome for everyone and on the right, it’s let my family enjoy life as we were before."
2021-09-21 11:50:40,"Sorry, but this issue is about following the science or not following the science. I live in a county with a 35% vax rate, in which three-quarters voted for Trump. And yet, EVERY educated person here whom I know is vaccinated, and will readily admit it. 

The ""divide"" between vaxers and anti-vaxers here seems really to be little more than that between those who accept science (and mathematics in the case of an epidemic) and those who do not.  Why this is so is another question. Cynical political leadership from the Right has made it impossible to close the divide."
2021-09-21 11:51:17,"“Maybe the key lies in the left’s increasing sense of itself as occupying the seat of power and the right’s sense of its marginalization — which naturally changes the way each side reacts to the use of authority in a crisis.”

To me this is the killer line (no pun intended): the party with national power must govern for the masses to stay in office, taking a stand in support of public health. The minority party must take a stand of the outvoted and outnumbered, hoping enough of them can tip the balance eventually to take power again. There’s no winning when your policies agree with the opposition. So in states where the minority party DOES have power (eg TX and FL), policies against mask mandates MUST be anti-anti-mask mandates."
2021-09-21 11:51:59,"""In less than two years, we’ve gone from a world where it was normal for a left-leaning publication to run an essay gently celebrating the defiance of public health rules during a brutal outbreak of the plague, to a world where the defiance of public health rules during a less lethal pandemic is coded as incredibly right wing.""

Not sure I agree with this reading of the original article. The article seems less about celebrating the defiance of rules for the sake of it and more about the human spirit prevailing and the inability of the population to accept that there is a threat if they don't see its immediate effects directly--the human urge to ""dance through a pandemic"", in a literal and figurative sense. 

As for the ""weird flip"" you mention, look to Donald Trump directly for that. He politicized the virus in every way he could, stoking up his supporters for a fight, so that basic public health strategies became what they're willing to go to the mat for and impossible for them to accept. And so it continues."
2021-09-21 11:52:01,"This is not ""weird politics"" at all. This should be an eye opener for Douhat that maybe he has reasoned himself into a cul-de-sac. He went wrong from the start by saying the Sanita felt right wing to him. Public health measures are non-partisan. The temporary measures needed may certainly have authoritarian overtones, but   they are emergergency measures that should and do vanish when people stop dying.

Liberals have not flipped at all. Yes, you can cherry pick exceptions, but the vast majority did and do support science based, reality based actions. When Covid came along, they applied exacly ths same approach that they have applied, say to climate change. They aren't exactly happy when recommendations change over time, but realize that science isn't  perfect and that knowledge evolves. It is specifically Republicans and their media that have forced this through a political prism and call for a juvenile level of consistency. It is enlightening to me that Douthat is so confused by this. It isn't society. It is him."
2021-09-21 11:55:44,"In Foucault's critique of biopolitics, he was not opposing the fact that states use power to foster life and health. He was tracing how biopolitics produces and hardens cleavages in societies by helping some populations flourish while others are deemed an internal threat to ""life"" and exposed to illness and death.

The biopolitics of the US was all too clear in Covid: yes, the federal government distributed cash, but only some populations had high rates of hospitalizations and death when the virus hit hard. Our biopolitics were already baked in by our income disparities and a healthcare system that is massively unequal, by design."
2021-09-21 11:59:02,"I've just returned from three weeks bicycling through France. I took me a week to get my digital health pass, but, once I had it, I flashed it every time I went into a public place, along with everyone else.  I was glad to know that everyone inside the cafe or train or restaurant was either vaccinated or had a recent negative test.  

In France, masks inside are also mandatory.  I was in a train station, went outside for a moment, and forgot to put my mask on when I got back inside.  A security guard gently reminded me to put my mask on.  I didn't feel the slightest bit oppressed somehow.  Maybe that's just me. But it's just not that big a deal. 

While in Paris, I was outside a pharmacy, waiting for my rapid test (15 minutes) to get on a plane back to the U.S.  A few hundred people walked by, handing out leaflets, mostly ignored by those on the sidewalks. 

The cafes and restaurants and sidewalks and trains are very crowded in France. But take a look at France's infection rates.  They are dropping like a rock.  These measures are simple and they work. They are nowhere near as onerous as those described in Florentine. And, once infection rates drop, people will much sooner  be able to go back to their normal lives.  It's that simple.  

Michel Foucault, as you know, Ross, was French.  To say that right wing kooks and anti-vaxxers sound like the subtle philosopher is, quite frankly, absurd."
2021-09-21 11:59:33,"You know someone's grasping at straws when they cherrypick a book review and exhalt it into the viewpoint of ""the left."" Maybe not so surprising when that person wanted schools open (they should have been when classes could've been held outside) but somehow can't see that outdoor largely masked civil rights protests were low-risk pre-Delta. What I'm struck by is the antivax right's focus on the evils of big government compelling compliance with (sound) public health policies when vaccinations are really about protecting those close to the antivaxxers, both within their homes and in their individual communities."
2021-09-21 12:06:26,"It seems practically mandatory for conservatives grasping at straws in Covid management debates to criticize support of liberals for social justice demonstrations last summer. Ross seems to ignore the clear scientific finding that the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer did not result in an uptick in Covid cases. Researchers pointed both to the fact that these demonstrations were held outside, and to a high degree of mask-wearing among the demonstrators."
2021-09-21 12:06:41,"As a 61 year old white male who has spent his entire life as a progressive or on the left, as you call it, I simply  do not recognize the attributes Ross assigns to me.  What I have always believed is that freedom and equality for ALL PEOPLE must be at the foundation of our society and that government must act for the benefit of everyone, not just the rich and powerful.  Actions require knowledge and reason.  It’s simple and practical, but it works as a basic guiding principle. The reactions and actions of the left to the pandemic have been in accord with that guiding principle.   Those on the right have been triangulating about control and power and using lies and the most awful tactics imaginable to stay in power. There is no reason or decency in how they have acted.  They do not have the public good at heart.   If you ask that question about all of the nonsense the right spews it is very ease to discern the difference between right and wrong and the right wingers are so clearly wrong.  Conservatives like Ross seem to need to cast the left in a false light that allows a “he said, she said” analysis.  Almost all of us on the left don’t recognize the attributes you assign us.  Maybe the need for that false dichotomy is a subliminal concession.
Moreover, Foucault is a very controversial person who long ago ceased being a darling of either the left or right.  He had significant insight on issues related to how society treats the marginalized and little more."
2021-09-21 12:07:37,"As it happens I also read that article in the LRB and yes the Sanita worked. However, to use its authors opinions in an excellent but relatively obscure journal as in any way reflective of left of center US opinion of how to respond to the pandemic in 2020/21 is bizarre. Basically they have taken the Sanita approach just as the left of center government in NZ did. So what is Douhat talking about?"
2021-09-21 12:09:35,"I think it's not just about ideological ""camps"", but also our perspective and what each of us considers evidence that drives our responses. As a person who worked in public health, I have tried to follow the science and understand that we may need to adjust our approach as we learn more about the virus and how it spreads. I constantly monitor the medical and public health literature and although vaccinated I still wear a mask in public and err on the side of caution. I care about other people and wear a mask as much as for others as myself. Those who don't feel a need to be vaccinated or wear a mask likely put themselves over others, and may also be in denial of the issue due to misinformation or fear. Some people may have difficulty changing their behavior if they have never had to do so and therefore resist. As we see daily, there are lots of ""conversions"" of people who change their opinion of the vaccines and virus once they have personal experience with it--unfortunate that some have to learn the hard way."
2021-09-21 12:14:50,"Back in January of 2020 I was against the right's call travel restrictions from China because I saw it as typically xenophobic, ""white hat/black hat"" fear mongering. I now see how travel restrictions (across the board) could have minimized spread.

I can admit that travel restrictions (again, not targeted, but universal) were a good idea, and I was wrong to oppose them. However I was not wrong to oppose the obvious, malign origins of Trumps call for travel bans from China.

And yes, I can agree with your observations and I too, have noticed some of the flip-flops of disposition in our times. I will still stand by my convictions that 95% of the right's agenda is based on wealth acquisition, xenophobia and empire."
2021-09-21 12:15:46,"The biology and tools to eliminate infection has changed a bit from the 17th century.  The reasons to get immunized, social distant, and wear masks rest on stronger grounds in the 21st century.  It becomes the underpinning what it means to endorse human survival versus wishful thinking.  Ideology almost plays no place in whether we live or die.  Those living in a society must realize certain behaviors are detrimental to others either as a matter of ethics, law, or civil rights."
2021-09-21 12:17:07,"Polio vaccines are okay, but Covid vaccines are an overreach? You write as though there are 2 polarized views about public health.

2021-09-21 12:18:16,This is a more succinct rendition of Matt Taibi's Substack 'The Left is the New Right' Bravo to Mr. Douthat for more clearly and concisely getting the point across. I'll be fascinated to see how this role reversal develops over the next 10-20 years.
2021-09-21 12:20:15,"Two words. A different time and place. New Zealand.

Half the American people simply cannot accept and comprehend anything that inconveniences THEM.

It is the only thing that the ""left"" and the ""right"" have in common.

2021-09-21 12:25:49,"Who has the right to shut everything down? In truth, no one. It isn't in the Constitution, it's not anywhere.

The people, the society at large, possess the right to make a decision for themselves: let's stop here.

There wasn't any time in March/April 2020 to develop any sort of consensus. Fauci and the rest grabbed the playbook that had been developed, more or less in the hidden bowels of government, under G.W. Bush and said, ""Let's go with this."" (Bush read a book about 1918, said, ""Do something"".)

It is important to remember that at that early stage, only the scientific/medical community had enough knowledge to have a full vision of what this disease meant.  The key metric was the lethality rate, the percentage of those who would die relative to the number infected and this figure was only emerging and ominous. Plus, the R0 factor, the rate or relative ease with which the first round of virus could spread. Consider, too, this: only they could (figuratively) look in the microscope and see where the disease might go, what variations might attack later. The rest of us didn't know.

As for the left/right divide, hooey! Though they sing hymns to FREEDOM!, the right has a major authoritarian streak buried in its DNA. The left is deterministic, convinced that we are bound by background and circumstance to behave in certain ways. 

Real problem: the virus hit us by surprise, knocking us out of our comfort zone, plus we had an egomaniacal person pretending to be president."
2021-09-21 12:28:47,"Not odd at all.

2021-09-21 12:28:48,"I must be getting old; I never would have predicted that a question of best practices in dealing with a medical problem would become a political issue, to be argued and decided by people with absolutely no medical expertise.

There was no nonsense about the vaccine having crazy side effects even after a defective batch of the Sabin oral vaccine a used an outbreak in Africa."
2021-09-21 12:32:22,"I had to read through this column twice to try to get the gist of his argument - and it still doesn’t make sense.  Mr. Douthat’s folly is that he tries to pin labels on thought and actions - left, right, hawks, doves, really? - while sensible people are taking steps supported by science.  What a concept, right?"
2021-09-21 12:33:48,"The politics of Covid have been stoked by the many inconsistencies in our national public health response.

It's understandable that some of the early confusion was due to our lack of knowledge about the virus.

On the positive side, we did a fair job of detection. This is the first order of business of a public health policy.

On the negative side of detection, we embraced the PCR test but never developed national standards for its use. Once we took the ""anything is better than nothing"" approach the waters were open to political interpretations.

Worse, it left us with unreliable numbers about the rate of infection.

But the biggest failure was the rejection of treatment options. An overweight, 73 year old man with a poor diet got Covid. 

He was treated by a first class medical team with HDQ, probably vitamin D, maybe drugs. But he was out of the hospital and back at work in three days.

But because that patient was Trump the media immediately branded his treatment as in the orbit of lies common to his presidency.

We never asked his doctors to explain their approach and from that point forward, few treatment options were explored. Our policy became vaccination or hospitalization, period.

Meanwhile, doctors in Mexico, Japan and India saved countless lives with drugs like Ivermectin and HDQ.

We refused to look at their data because it might have given ""the Donald"" one more issue to flail about.

Science gave way to politics and we all lost."
2021-09-21 12:40:15,"hindsight is usually 20/20.  The problem of the scientific illiteracy of the public is the problem.   Remember when it was called the novel corona virus?  The lack of data early last year pushed the medical community and the scientists to take measures that were the best available at the time and now continues to evolve and change as we get more data. The public claims it is flip flopping because they don't understand how science and medicine actually do their jobs.  As to the anti maskers and anti vaxxers (a vast majority who are conservative) , they want their personal freedumb and the sad part is they refuse to do something that could save their communities.  Selfish to the extreme."
2021-09-21 12:40:40,"I think the responses to this column, and Mr. Douthat’s previous one covering the same ground, have been astounding. Acknowledging shifting viewpoints and how crisis, fear and power affect partisan responses to public events is not “both-siderism,” it’s acknowledging reality. I’m vaccinated, wear a mask when required and think everyone else should, also. I think the anti-vaxers are insane. I also think the people who fly into indignant rages at the idea that government overreach is something to vigilantly guard against (because, you know, history) and that civil liberties should be strictly redefined in terms of their comfort   are entitled children. Listen to your doctor, use common sense, read Foucault and, for the love of god, please stop quoting Jay Rosen."
2021-09-21 12:41:03,"Referring to our experience with Covid, Mr. Douthat concludes:

""I don’t know exactly why or exactly what it means. I just want people to acknowledge that it has happened and it’s really, really weird.""

Probably not the conclusion reached by the families and friends of the 676,191 lost souls.  They most certainly don't sit a around their dinner tables and say, wow wasn't that weird."
2021-09-21 12:15:22,"What's ""weird"" is people not getting vaccinated."
2021-09-21 11:17:30,"The right wants the pandemic to go on as long as possible so they can use it as a cudgel against the Democrats in the midterms.  They would rather let thousands of Americans die than give Biden any sort of “win,” and there are far too many people who have brainwashed by Facebook and Fox News who will eagerly go along with it.

It’s really not that complicated."
2021-09-21 12:42:31,"Still working on the horror of mortality being ""33 percent in Venice, 46 percent in Milan and a staggering 61 percent in Verona"".
If Covid ever genetically changed itself to such a dangerous variant, we in America would be devastated. Our economy is vibrant, but it depends on many different parts coming together, and if one or two are destroyed, say the transportation and the sales outlets, then starvation could ensue.
The cynical part of my brain, these days greatly exercised, tells me that that eventuality would in fact be the breeding ground for the end of America, the end of democracy, and the beginning of a constitutional aristocracy, as in Russia today.
America itself might not hold together, for we could easily be the Soviet Union, split apart by demons of desperation and opportunism. 
No doubt such a danger will present itself fairly soon, for that is the nature of international travel and virus replication. 
Medical science is most likely all that will stand between us and the nightmare of such a plague. And we don't have to time travel to remember such a thing, I lived in the 1950's during the polio devastation. 
Dr. Fauci, stay strong. 
Trump..."
2021-09-21 11:49:57,"I would suggest that the Republican response to the pandemic was never about science or medicine. It was about their continued contrarianism about virtually every issue and challenge we face. 

Go back to February of 2020, which was right after the January 6 insurrection and during the continued drumbeat of entirely false Republican claims that the presidential election was a fraud. We'd just come off of four years of Trumpian contrarianism: Essentially, Donald Trump and his party decided that they only had to govern for the benefit of those who voted for Trump, and the half the country who did not vote for him should suffer for it. Virtually every issue was viewed through this lens. If the Democrats were for it, the Republicans were against it. Every issue was quickly turned into a media rallying cry--Socialism! Freedom! Immigrant hoards at the border! War on Christians! Killing babies! Income redistribution! Wokeness! Cancel culture! 

Into that world came COVID-19. To Republicans it became another opportunity for a contrarian talking point to mobilize their angry, fearful base. And if some people died, well, said Republicans, people die of the flu every day. What's a few more in defense of ""our freedom""?

So let's stop hand-wringing over our response and why the GOP did what it did. Facts and public safety never mattered to them. They wanted to keep their base angry, fearful and motivated through the pandemic and during Biden's term.  Frankly, their tactic worked."
2021-09-21 12:29:29,"Your column is an utter waste of time - mine and yours.  

Just come out and admit it - the ""Right"", in resisting COVID control measures, which they continue to do right up to this moment, is the only real problem worth discussing and it is a very serious one.   No one cares one whit about the niceties of who said what when at the start of the pandemic, when issues were clouded and uncertain - the picture is very clear now and it is very clear what citizens should be doing to save lives and longer term - to help the economy by not getting sick and dying.

No ""both sides"" nonsense, Douthat.  The discussion on this topic is over, and your job at this point is to convince conservatives of the wisdom of doing what's right and doing it ASAP.   Use your pulpit for for something useful for once."

That’s why they say “the election was stolen” even though they know it was not. That’s why they can’t resist making videos of themselves “owning the libs” from the ICU taking their last breath. 

If this is a mystery to you, I cannot imagine the rarified air you breathe."
2021-09-21 11:38:25,"Weird, weird, weird is correct when describing our current Covid stances.  The weirdness is not the flip flop (not as great as you write Ross), but is found in the embracing of our education of the science of Covid 19.  It is smart, smart and smart to update and change our thoughts and behavior as we live through this.  The individual and community that evolved and changed to meet this challenge is reflective of a society that wishes to grow and mature.   What is dumb, dumb, and dumb is the individual that is only focused on themselves, and refusing to evolve and change about the science and morality of simple measures like masking, distancing, and vaccinations to reduce and no control Covid 19.
Those who place their rights and choices above their own community, region, and the Nation hold a very stale, mean, and dark view of America's present and future."
2021-09-21 10:49:00,"Your recent columns on Covid responses on the left and right are penetrating and persuasive. Please DON’T stop writing about this. The questions you are raising need more, not less discussion."
2021-09-21 11:10:25,"The vaccines were created when Trump was president; democrats still had their sleeves rolled up ready to get vaccinated. We didn't care who was in charge, but trusted doctors and scientists over YouTube influencers.  The GOP decided that Fauci was the new HRC, because they have to have an enemy, red meat for the base to rage over.  The GOP and right wing pundits are killing off their voters.  Smart.  You sure showed us."
2021-09-21 12:23:44,Weird that the majority of anti-vaccine sentiment comes from people who identify with the RepublicanParty. Let’s see how this plays out when Republicans who reject science try to run for national office and if pundits like Douthat will call them out.
2021-09-21 12:45:27,"What???  The left been advocating restrictions on personal freedoms for 60 years now when it comes to protecting children, the environment, social equality, etc. Look at the political response to global climate change. The right has been anti science ever since nuclear war went out of fashion in the 1950’s."
2021-09-21 12:45:31,"All of the crazy right wing political posturing around the COVID-19 pandemic - all - are based on the principle of denialism which is the employment of rhetorical arguments to give the appearance of a legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists.
Rejection of scientific consensus is political useful in so many ways for supporting racism, women's access to reproductive health care, conspiracies regarding elections, and fiscal policy -- and, perhaps most important, religion. We see denialism underlying nearly all the policy positions of Republican governors and Federal legislators."
2021-09-21 12:11:40,"I picture Ross standing in an aisle at the market, staring intently at a box of instant oatmeal and a package of regular oats. Like a cinematic timelapse, the shoppers come and go, grab random items and go on their way. All the while, his inner monologue waxes incessantly on the merits of both options. He considers the musings of Keynes, Marx, and Locke while he stands frozen, unable to make a decision. ""Does buying instant oatmeal make me a socialist?"" In the end, he cannot decide and moves on to the bread aisle where the same scenario plays out."
2021-09-21 12:46:27,"It isn't weird or surprising to think that individual liberty is limited where it threatens harm to others. The Covid pandemic reveals how very interdependent we all are, around the planet. This interdependence requires solidarity among people everywhere, which we have difficulty achieving.

What Foucault said about ""biopower"" was that ideas about preserving and fostering life have changed over centuries. (Foucault analyzed some of these changes.) Change can be confusing and Mr. Douthat is confused."
2021-09-21 12:11:20,"These statements from the article are exactly right:
“Knowing what we know now, I would have supported much more draconian measures in February 2020, in terms of travel restrictions, border closures and quarantine requirements, than anything we did. I still think the March response to the first coronavirus wave — shut everything down and spend a lot of money until we figure out just how bad this is going to be — was fundamentally correct.”

2021-09-21 10:11:15,This essay looks like an attempt to squeeze all of everything onto a left-right scale.  It doesn't work.  Some things (like science) don't give a hoot for your political position.  Public health is orthogonal to political orientation--or should be.
2021-09-21 12:33:41,"Despite the protestations of my friends here on the so-called left, Douthat is largely correct.  And, one could argue that his observations can easily be applied to all manner of subjects beside COVID.  Russia?  Trade?  Free speech?  This isn't to say that boilerplate whataboutism renders both sides equal.  It doesn't.  The Democrats are their usual mess.  The Republicans are a cancer.  That said, some of it really is a bit weird and disorienting and the failure to acknowledge that only ties Ross' interlocutors into tighter and tighter knots."
2021-09-21 12:20:18,"It’s not enantiodromia per se but rather the insistence that a political ideology doesn’t change over time (and by extension, that people are hypocrites when they change their opinions) that makes this piece insightful."
2021-09-21 12:46:14,"The Trump party faithful refuse vaccines primarily to try to prevent Biden's administration from beating the Covid crisis.

I speak with Trump supporters every day and they really believe that Biden will say he beat Covid when Trump couldn't and they don't want Biden to have that advantage in the next election.

Trump is the GOP. The GOP is Trump.  I feel sorry for Mr.Douthat. Every week he struggles to find some false equivalency that enables him to remain - just - a loyal die hard Republican."
2021-09-21 12:03:07,"Oh come on, Ross; you write saying ""unhappiness and loneliness and misery, especially on the young"" during this pandemic is a tragedy worth dying for. Get a grip.

They'll survive - until global warming gets them."
2021-09-21 11:04:32,"The last thing needed is another political columnist without science background weighing in on this subject. It's not as complicated as he would like to make it. 

Though the exact recommendations evolve with the facts, Fauci, et al, are all you really need to follow. In this case the ""experts"" have the expertise. The rest is static."
2021-09-21 11:30:50,"There are some insightful points here, but this analysis suffers from a fundamental flaw.  This one book is picked out as representative of the ""left"". That is, one data point, one view. Then a few post-modernists are carelessly flung in to construct ""the"" leftist viewpoint.  Then all people left of center who are concerned about wearing masks are grouped under this label.  This is incredibly sloppy thinking passing for profound thought.  There is no single postmodernist left, but a complex tapestry of thinkers left of center, many of whom do not fit this at all.  Talking about the left in this simplistic way is easy and satisfying but destructive as it just heightens polarity. And yes there are those who would indeed worry about the genuine effects of the use of state power in any situation including this one, but that would lead many to think in terms of how to take measures to mitigate these effects rather than pretend that the Black Death was not deadly or indeed to celebrate those who break the rules as a pandemic rages.   I suggest you stop pandering to prejudice and purse a more honest albeit less satisfying analysis."
2021-09-21 12:11:09,"""I don’t know exactly why or exactly what it means."" 
I was thinking the same thing about this article. Can anyone boil it down for me?"
2021-09-21 12:31:25,"I'd just like to point out that I see very few left-leaning people articulating how they were mistaken, in one form or another, on any current subject. 

Having a liberal mind means the ability to be critical of your own thoughts, as well as others. 

I do see quite a bit of self critique and re-positioning (albeit mild) among David Brooks, Bret Stephens, and Ross Douthat. Yet, with the exception of Ezra Klein, not a shred of doubt among the left flank of NYT columnists... I am very liberal, but maybe Ross has a point."
2021-09-21 10:57:08,As a Left Liberal who hates Foucault and always saw his reflections on power as a backdoor to Reagan I don't feel any flip. The Anti-Vaxx movement may count among it's supporters some New Agers who reject all medical science but that is in no way progressive.
2021-09-21 12:50:25,"I’d venture to say that the Right’s rejection of COVID-19 mitigation procedures could be construed is its own form of authoritarianism: specifically the absolute deference to one specific leader figure.

I have little doubt that had Mr. Trump advocated for masking early on in the pandemic, those same conservatives who stock up on military grade weapons and armor in the name of ‘personal protection’ would be exactly the ones enforcing mask wearing and intimidating those who would flout such procedures. 

Conversely, I’d venture that the Left’s strong arming lockdowns, mask mandates, and now vaccine mandates could be construed as a libertarian response, as a fundamental tenet of libertarianism is that harming others is the limit given to one’s personal freedom - the classic line “Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins” comes to mind."
2021-09-21 12:32:07,"1. If the Trump administration had not had their heads in the sand in the beginning, we could have minimized the catastrophe we have experienced.  

2. The author virtually ignores the emergence of the Delta variant and the damage the right has wrought with their ignorant stance ignoring basic safety measures resulting in chaos for the rest of us."
2021-09-21 12:04:22,"Boy, Mr. Douthat's comment ""I remain a Covid hawk relative to other conservative commentators"" is a ridiculous statement as he suggests that mandates are a bridge too far.  Taking our foot off the break at this time is foolhardy!  We are back to full ICUs and daily death rates that are staggering because of this kind of thinking."
2021-09-21 12:31:16,"It's not so much ""weird"" as difficult for you because you are often so focused on creating this ""left wing"" critique of everything that you miss some obvious points.  To take the reviewer's ""folly"" and claim it is a ""particular kind of left-wing folly"" is really trying to hard.  And, as often in your columns which could otherwise be excellent and could challenge a liberal catholic like me... that phrase leads me to  roll my eyes and say ""Douthat doing that thing again.""  There's plenty of good faith wrong takes on the pandemic... plenty of starts and stops by thoughtful people on left / right.  There's also very obvious bad faith leaders.  You seem desperate to find equivalent left-wing bad faith.  It doesn't serve you well."
2021-09-21 12:34:32,Simultaneous to the shift Ross Douthat describes is a large political shift from an unhinged Republican President to a centrist Democrat. I think the two are related.
2021-09-21 12:52:08,"While this is normal Ross both sidesing but still he somehow finds the left is worse there are a few points worth making. Two are near the end of this column. The first is that the left was against Trump's initial travel ban but at the time the science said that this would likely not spread that quickly to the US from Asia and Ross (as well as most of the right) ignore how poorly it was designed and implemented and also how terrible the later European ban was designed and implemented. Remember the lines indoors at airports? The second is him placing blame on the left for being hypocritical about the protests first for reopening in March and April and then the BLM protests of the summer. Leaving aside the morality he of course doesn't note that again the science was starting to show that being outdoors was fairly safe, especially if masked, by May and June and into the summer but that did not science did not exist in March and April for people grouping up maskless even outdoors.

The last note I would make is that Ross as well as many others both in the ""center"" and the right continue to scare monger that somehow these powers will last forever but where I live in very liberal MA besides being back to masks indoors everything is really quite normal."
2021-09-21 12:53:15,"""Maybe the key lies in the left’s increasing sense of itself as occupying the seat of power and the right’s sense of its marginalization — which naturally changes the way each side reacts to the use of authority in a crisis...""

This is a really good point.  But only if we understand that a ""seat of power"" is a much broader thing than just elected office.  Because the right is still doing pretty well, and the left still pretty marginal, in that arena.

The left primarily dominates areas where there is entrenched bureaucracy.  Education is one area: not just college campuses, but (maybe especially) the entities that regulate education at all levels, like accreditors.  Businesses, especially those that employ and listen to their Equity and Diversity offices.  Media and entertainment, of course.  

What seems clear is that the left has become confident in the validity of rules created to constrain our behavior, while the right is more skeptical than ever."
2021-09-21 12:53:39,"I don't deny the ""flip""--to a degree--but this liberal was a pro-Sanità (had I know of it) covid hawk from the beginning, and I think to state that the contrary was a broad ""liberal"" position is to take a small minority as representing the whole. 

However many ""California anti-MMR vax"" leftists there may have been, that was never a broad liberal or progressive position. 

In fifties Eisenhower America, polio vaccination was not a partisan issue (and while it may not have been widely known then, polio has non-symptomatic infections probably to a greater degree than covid-19). In 1952, 3,145 died from polio. When the vaccine became available, it was mandatory for children.

The covid downplayers have consistently been wrong. At some point, the pandemic will fade (probably). Every short-term prediction of when has been wrong so far. 

I continue to have no more sympathy for those who say that their freedom is impinged upon by vaccination than they have for those who may suffer or die because of their behavior. Get the jabs or stay home."
2021-09-21 12:57:24,"Two suggestions
I think you would benefit from trying to see the world as less binary - right versus left. Your critiques are limited by this framework.
Remember that making policy during a public health crisis is very different from looking back in time. In the midst of a crisis erring on the side of being overly cautious is prudent."
2021-09-21 12:58:44,"What is hard to remember is that the science of COVID did not exist 18 months ago, so people were taking positions and making projections on almost no hard data.  This brings politics and the press into its favored position—just making it up and blathering on.  Asked on what we see most of the population is still living with media myth and political misdirection. We’re just not very smart."
2021-09-21 12:59:27,"Ross seems to have entirely missed the most obvious explanation of what he considers a right/ left flip in  the response to COVID. The left has consistently valued the common good, while the right has consistently valued individual autonomy. Public health restrictions in the face of a pandemic are the most effective way to serve the common good, that is to limit the spread of disease and to keep the largest number of people healthy and alive. That the left would embrace these strategies makes all the sense in the world. That the right, especially the libertarian right, not to mention the conspiracy-Trumpist right would resist them also makes all the sense in the world. It's really not that weird, Ross. Both right and left have responded as one would expect.

 Like Ross, I am a practicing Christian, though we likely have some theological disagreements. I am on the left politically precisely because it values the common good that is one of the core tenets of what Jesus taught: you shall love your neighbor as yourself."
2021-09-21 12:24:30,"Another conservative pundit inventing strawmen. Since when was it liberal orthodoxy to oppose government attempts to oppose an epidemic? My recollection is that it was liberals who marched and protested for INCREASED federal response to finding an AIDS cure, and that it was President Reagan and his right=wing cronies who advocated the authoritarian solution of rounding up HIV-infected Americans and putting them in internment camps on the grounds that they posed a threat to decent, moral people."
2021-09-21 12:14:06,"Contrary to Florence hundreds of years ago, humans now understand germ-theory, know about viruses, have effective and safe vaccines , and can employ improved ways of isolating, even in public, with masks.

What's ""weird"" is how many people choose to ignore the facts, cling to misinformation, and to become ill and sometimes die because of....what?"
2021-09-21 11:49:56,"Another terrible column by Mr. Douthat.  Let the science lead.   Left, right, hawk dove the virus doesn't care and neither should you."
2021-09-21 13:00:23,"Perhaps the essential left-right divide is not ""Government: pro or con?"" or even ""Authority: bad or good?"", but rather lies in the details of how governmental authorities act:  under what logic and in whose interest?

I think it's also possible that at some point the left-right divide will no longer the most relevent one—that it is being replaced by a distinction between those who believe in evidence and will follow the science wherever it may lead, vs. those who are motivated by various tribal, religious, or superstitious attachments.  (While the first group may be more strongly associated with the left and the second with the right at our present moment, there are certainly people from both sides in each of these categories.)"
2021-09-21 10:52:59,"Ross, the only reason this pandemic continues is because clueless conservatives won't get vaccinated. The party of stupid is truer today than it ever was."
2021-09-21 13:03:52,"It is obviously impractical in the federal government of these states, to secure all rights of independent 
Sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all: Individuals entering into society, 
must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstances, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be reserved; and on the present occasion this difficulty was increased by a difference among the several states as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests.
input from George Washington--the Original Originalist"
2021-09-21 13:05:04,"Before one can enter into an honest debate about the politics of Covid, one has to be complete genuine about the key figure responsible for how we arrived at our unacceptable death toll: Donald Trump.  Ross conveniently, disingenuously downplays this critical  point stating Trump simply chose “Covid minimizing rhetoric”.  No, Ross, he did far more than that.  He lied about Covid.  He lied from the onset, knowing it was airborne.  He lied about best scientific practices.  He lied about the viability of treatments. Why? Because he knew it would take a toll on his re-election odds.  So he simply appealed to his base, and set in motion a Frankenstein’s monster reaction chain that ended in millions of people being anti-vax.  Ultimately resulting in tens, if not hundreds of thousands of needless additional deaths from the Delta strain. 

Everything else is really debating at the edges.  Trump was the central figure in this American catastrophe."
2021-09-21 13:05:28,"Sorry, I don't buy that ""the left"" fails to ""acknowledge anything worrisome about the new high-tech hygiene regime."" All the leftists I know agree that it's a terrible idea for government to mandate the medical choices of free individuals. And Democratic leaders have absolutely gone to extremes to avoid imposing mandates. We've now gone through nearly a year of Democratic leaders begging people to do the right thing and get vaccinated. In return, a significant portion of Americans have acted like bratty children, whining about their right to do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences to themselves or anyone else. So we're finally at a point where, like children, they have to be told what to do by the adults in the room. I don't think anyone is happy about this outcome. Those on either side of the political spectrum who are sincerely concerned about liberty will choose to govern their own behavior so there's no reason for authorities to restrict their freedoms."
2021-09-21 13:05:29,"Ross, American conservatives prefer less government whereas American progressives prefer more government.  Consequently,  since mandates have to be enforced by government, it seems natural for me for conservatives to rebel somewhat.  Why is this so hard to understand?"
2021-09-21 13:06:56,"First of all, masks work, especially good quality masks. And they continue to be an important part of the vaccination-mask-ventilation-rapid-testing combination for combatting Delta and allowing schools to open safely.

As to left vs. right, political principles have to be judged on their real-world effects. Nature cares nothing for political philosophy. The heaviest casualties of Covid today are on the right. There is no way to create equivalence here.

For whatever reasons, people who call themselves Republicans and conservatives have been ending up on the wrong side of mother nature, whether the issue is vaccination or climate change or regulations to preserve the environment we depend on for our lives. Toxic individualism is catching up with us.

One last thing. We cannot measure the destructive effects of Covid solely by counting fatalities. The long-term effects of this disease on survivors and the costs of treating their various illnesses may be much greater in both dollars and suffering than current fatality rates can measure."
2021-09-21 13:07:49,"I disagree with Douthat’s premise that responses from Liberal and Libertarian factions was somehow counterintuitive and philosophically inconsistent with their respective traditional positions.

The primary objective of COVID restrictions in 2020 was to conserve healthcare capacity. It is easy to forget the pure panic of watching hospital systems in New York and New Jersey collapsing in the spring of 2020. That was the horrifying prospect that public health officials were trying to avoid playing out across the country, particularly in states were rural healthcare networks lacking the scale to respond.

In 2021, a primary post-vaccine objective (and opportunity) is to achieve vaccination rates necessary to mitigate the emergence of even more contagious and lethal variants. 

Painful and consequential COVID restrictions require individuals, families and communities to sacrifice for the greater good. In this sense, the respective responses among Liberal and Libertarian factions have been philosophically consistent with traditional positions on individual sacrifice (taxation) for the greater good - universal healthcare, early childhood education, social safety net, etc."
2021-09-21 13:08:53,"Mr. Douthat fails to point out that ""the left"" as he describes it for the most part is the part of contemporary society that embraces science. Most practicing scientists self identify as liberal. Perhaps the right's abject rejection of any scientific understanding that doesn't comport with its ideology is at work here. I don't see anyone on the left rushing to veterinary supply houses for ivermectin nor were liberals the ones who flew the hydroxychloroquine flag."
2021-09-21 13:10:00,"I stopped reading at the line ""I think mask requirements should have gone away..."" because, just before reading this essay, I had looked at two things: the national Covid map and the national mask mandate mask. The correlation between the two is indisputable. My state, Illinois, has relatively low rates and a mask mandate. We are surrounded by states with higher rates but no mask mandate. The same is true nationally; states with high Covid rates have little or no mask mandate. I know correlation is not always causation but, in this case it's a no-brainer; masks save lives. The sooner we accept this minor infringement on our personal freedom the sooner we will be free to live our normal lives."
2021-09-21 12:50:12,"I recently read in an influential right wing source that the Left’s pro vaccine stance promoted so that the Right would reject the vaccine - and die in greater numbers.

Yup, this is what we have come to."
2021-09-21 13:06:23,"It's the 21st century not the 17th. Let's all just roll up our sleeves, get vaccinated, practice social distancing, and get over ourselves. These kinds of lengthy articles are interesting to read but are really not helpful. Weirdness is nothing new. Get a grip Ross."
2021-09-21 13:11:27,"It's fine to discuss ""flips,"" whether real or not, consequential or not, but the political bottom line is that the Republicans have placed a losing bet on resisting vaccines, masking and mandates.   Not sure about that?  Look at the map that directly correlates Republican advocacy with the anti-vaccination movement.   The most recent and telling example is the California recall election.  The rest of the U.S. map shows a solid red patch stretching across the south.  And you know what's happening there.  With Republican political positioning being linked to increased hospitalizations and death, Republican political leaders are following Trump into an electoral dead end."
2021-09-21 13:12:33,"Two things, combined.  A visible loyalty test of not wearing a mask, and the expression of an almost religious right to personal ""freedom"", while ignoring social benefits.   The combination fit the Trumpers like a glove."
2021-09-21 13:14:43,"There are enough very good and interesting points here to make this a worthwhile read, but I feel it ignores a lot in order to justify a central point that doesn't entirely hang together. 

Clearly the partisan divide over these issues are mostly attributable to the same reflexive alignment for or against whatever Trump's haphazard impulses are, but it also does broadly line up with traditional party attitudes about role of government and affinity for institutions.

We're also in a time where ideological cores are increasingly disconnected from tribal politics. If you look at the ACTUAL left (as in not Democrats), they tend to have attitudes on this that we'd associate more with libertarians or Republicans."
2021-09-21 13:17:40,"I think you are normalizing the current conservative stance on Covid (and other issues) as ""libertarian."" It might be libertarian if they were accepting facts and basic moral values. They are not. It is nihilism."
2021-09-21 12:52:25,"I'm a liberal leaning person, but ""lefty"" is not a useful term here. I wish Douthat would stop trying to justify adherence to Covid mandates"
2021-09-21 12:51:39,"Douthat apparently has very bad memories. Weren’t there the blue states practiced the masking, distancing and lockdowns back in March 2020 while the red states resisted and refused such practices?"
2021-09-21 13:22:05,"In the 17th century, Sanita did not have the benefit of understanding how and why the disease they were fighting spread.  In fact, it was the fleas and rats that carried and primarily spread the bubonic plague (in a minority of cases there was person to person transmission when lungs became infected and coughing spread the disease much like COVID). Perhaps, Florence may have had fewer rats than other cities.  In short, it may have been a cleaner city.  In the case of COVID, we understand much of how the disease is spread and how to prevent it through masks and vaccinations, but a portion of our populace is so conditioned to questioning authority first before understanding or even believing the facts as they stand that we are now left with the situation where COVID has become a disease that primarily affects those who are skeptical of authority and those who only believe facts if they personally witness them. Right now, the majority of these independent minded, skeptical, people tend to reside on the Right, but it wouldn't surprise me to find that this tendency toward skepticism and distrust authority migrates between political parties and almost always settles on the party that is not in power."
2021-09-21 13:24:11,"First of all, no one on the left or right reads Foucault except academics and this columnist. But referencing a philosopher without reference to his philosophy or how it speaks to this argument is all part of Douthat's schtick: An ""intellectual"" conservative who pretends to examine both sides, cites scholarship and literature, analyzes and jettisons the extremes on each side as a pragmatic observer, all in the service of a political philosophy that really can't be supported (or even really accurately defined) with intellectual arguments. Which is to say, the only reason I read Douthat is to see if I can figure out what he's trying to say. I'd like to think there is such a thing as a coherent, intellectual conservative argument, and Douthat supposedly comes close, but I still don't get it."
2021-09-21 13:24:47,The position of most of these commentators seems to be that what Ross is missing here is that the Left is correct and the Right is wrong. How can we have any sort of constructive dialogue when nobody is willing to even entertain a challenge to the correctness of their moral authority.
2021-09-21 09:54:46,Can't wait to check back later and read the comments.  . .and Ross . . it IS weird  . . .
2021-09-21 10:20:02,"Well I do hope Mr Douthat follows through on the promise that this will be his last column on Covid politics for a while. This column, indeed, seems like self-plagiarism: hasn't he already noted, several times, that ""Foucault lost the left and won the right"" ? (For example, see his column of May 25, 2021, helpfully displayed next to this Comments section). His anxiety about conservatives being culturally marginalized is increasingly ""weird."" Maybe it's time for this columnist to move to Texas, where he would feel right at home."
2021-09-21 13:25:52,"No, sir.

Even granting that some on the left are over-reacting to the relative threat that Covid-19 represents (post-vaccination, the risk of hospitalization and death is comparable to that of typical seasonal influenza), the anti-vaccine stance on the right is clearly driven mainly by politics and tribalism, rather than by any true libertarian philosophy.  Would a rational libertarian risk their life by refusing an effective vaccine and simultaneously legislate away a woman's right to control her own reproductive system or a fellow citizen's right to vote?

Nope."
2021-09-21 13:27:44,"Mr. Douthat finds it amazing that, in a public health emergency, people normally concerned with adverse consequences of governmental actions might temporarily subordinate those concerns to address imminent public health issues.  

Fortunately, we have a example of how draconian but necessary public health measures can be consistent with democratic principles:  New Zealand.

In that country, borders were effectively closed (as opposed to this country where the actions taken were tardy and sprinkled liberally with exceptions) and strict lockdowns and quarantines imposed.  The political leadership united and maintained a consistent message based on the existing science.  The people understood and agreed.  

Mr. Douthat is at his best when he struggles with the important questions, like squaring public health with democratic principles.  He is at his worst when he tries to own the libs.  I am afraid this column is more towards owning the libs."
2021-09-21 13:28:14,"Good opinion piece.  It's baffling how so many on the right and a smaller number of people who used to identify as being on the left have seemed to embrace a Q Death Cult by refusing to vax, wear masks, social distance, get covid tests, or take covid seriously.  It reminds me of a different book I read many years ago, ""The Unthinkable"",  about disasters and who survives them vs who does not.  Some people react to disaster/crisis situations by denial and behavior which works against their chances of survival.  I think that's what we're seeing here."
2021-09-21 13:29:23,"I’ve been a consistent COVID dove since the beginning and think I was right. COVID was never the Black Death; it was containable through non-authoritarian measures like testing and tracing plus protecting the most vulnerable populations of elderly and getting vaccines out fast. I think the government to emulate is South Korea, which had a left-wing COVID-dovish policy that emphasized social trust and tracing and quarantining the sick over coercive measures like travel bans and other lockdowns.

The problem with lockdowns is that they pit some people against others because they always are or at least end up being discriminatory, and that is a guaranteed way to ensure that many people stop caring about fighting the virus and instead fight about who gets to live their lives and who has to be restricted."

I forget where I read it, but when Mr. Trump was elected somebody said (roughy paraphrased), ""Write down your priorities and ideals NOW, before they change.  Then watch how different they become over the next four years.""

On the left, people began cheering more FBI intrusion to stop gun viloence. Trump's ""locker-room"" talk was a mortal sin. Reaching out to N. Korea was folly.

On the right, the FBI became the bad guys. Evangelicals pooh-poohed any and all sexual morality issues (locker-room talk, Stormy relationships, paying hush money), welcomed talks with N. Korea, and (as usual) cheered on record deficits.  

Everything flipped on its head.  Ross, you can shake your finger at the left for cancel culture, double standards, and situational morality.  You'd gain credibility for shaking the same finger at the right.  For my part, I find it hard to take an evangelical, a fiscal conservative, or a law-n-order conservative seriously in any way."
2021-09-21 13:28:39,"It’s not weird at all. Liberals have adjusted their positions on Covid as scientific research on the disease and effective mitigation measures progressed. Conservatives have adjusted their positions out of spite to “own the libs” (eg, “He’s not hurting the people he needs to be”).

The strongly “pro-vaxx” sentiment on the left now is not some delusional chase for Covid zero—it is a resounding vote of confidence in the science underlying the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The “anti-vaxx” sentiment on the right is driven by a stubborn refusal to admit the liberals are correct. Take for example this recent quote from John Nolte in Breitbart:

“The organized left is deliberately putting unvaccinated Trump supporters in an impossible position where they can either NOT get a life-saving vaccine or CAN feel like cucks caving to the ugliest, smuggest bullies in the world.”"
2021-09-21 13:31:17,"Douthat seems addicted to complex, convoluted explanations when, frequently simpler ones work better.  His baroque theory describing the shifting attitudes of progressives and conservatives in the face of the developing pandemic focuses on political factors.  Political differences surely played a role, but science offers a more compelling explanation.

Medical experts, including Dr. Fauci, changed their recommendations as their understanding of the disease evolved.  Initial skepticism about the need to shut down the economy changed as the severe threat posed by the virus became apparent.  Similarly, recommendations about mask-wearing fluctuated as the medical community probed more deeply into how the disease spreads.

Liberals, generally committed to a scientific outlook, altered their behavior in response to these changing recommendations.  Trump's followers, more hostile to the dominant role played by experts, resisted Fauci's advice.  This focus on attitudes toward science does not fully explain everyone's behavior, but it constitutes an essential part of any such explanation."

2021-09-21 11:15:52,"Interesting take as always, but you are failing to take into account the left's historic embrace of public health agencies as bedrock dispensers of social good in society. They view government with suspicion and antipathy when it is the police for example but embrace its authority when it is eradicating disease and suffering."
2021-09-21 13:37:05,"Interesting take on the flip-flop.  Yes, conservatives do like order and control typically while liberals typically want more creativity and freedom of expression and thought.

I think it's different now because conservatives (and conservative leadership) are used to wielding that control over out groups or subordinates.  Keeping minorities policed and out of their spaces and neighborhoods, keeping workers wages low and power minimal, controlling women with patriarchy (see Texas abortion law), and controlling morality and sexuality through religion (see anti-LGBTQ and trans stances).

With COVID protocols and vaccines, the control is now foisted upon them and they don't like it.  And, it's probably quite shocking to their psyche, which is understandable.

The frustrating thing for most liberals is if conservatives would just get vaccinated, this pandemic would be over, and we could all go back to living our normal lives.  The conservative fear and anger of not being in control and turning to quack remedies and conspiracies as a result is just dragging this thing out unnecessarily.

Unfortunately, I don't think conservative attitudes will change any time soon, so--ironically--their thoughts and actions are just prolonging their own anger and misery with the situation.  They could have been metaphorically dancing mask free months ago if they'd just get over their control hangup and get the shot."
2021-09-21 13:38:46,"While Douthat wants to characterize the left as embracing ""stringent public health responses"", I don't think most members of the left view the requirement to wear a mask in indoor, public spaces as a stringent or draconian measure.  Other than adding something extra I need to remember to bring with me, having to wear a mask is not burden whatsoever--it's not any different from the fact that I have to wear shoes in indoor public places as well.  Vaccination, similarly, is not a new, extreme requirement, but rather just another sound health precaution like flu shots or health screenings.

You might get a different response on the left if the stringent lockdowns of March 2020 had continued."

I see consistency in right and left responses to health policy in the US in my lifetime.  The Affordable Care Act, even after it was watered down through fruitless compromises with right-wing politicians, improved our healthcare system by increasing the number of citizens with insurance.  This required sacrifices from individuals for the collective good, such as (heaven forbid!) paying taxes.  The right called it tyrannical government overreach, inventing nonsense such as 'death panels' and grotesquely comparing President Obama with Hitler, and the left argued that our government should have the power to limit short-sighted selfish behavior of those who did not want to pay for insurance until after they had already experienced a catastrophic health emergency and were then perfectly happy to pass the cost on to the rest of us.  The left believes that a large, well-funded government can improve the lives of every citizen and the childish myth of individualism has always been a talking point of the right."

So the anti-vax crowd is incorrect (he's got that right, anyway), but because they are acting like a bunch of public-health-hating liberals? Good grief. 
In matters of public health, the American left honors expertise and common sense, and in this pandemic grants authority to ethically bound epidemiologists who are attempting to serve the well-being of everyone.  The right is currently in the grip of  charlatans, opportunistic rabble-rousers and a vicious, stupid, would-be despot who has no concern about anything but his own wealth and power.  It's really that simple."
2021-09-21 13:42:57,"I didn't see that coming. I'm admittedly  just one lefty, a somewhat isolated single anecdotal data point, but it's news to me that wariness of ""stringent public health responses"" would be uncongenial to the left as a matter of basic ideology.

To see that that is so, we need only observe that the left embraced lockdowns and other mitigation measures at a time when we had a president who was eminently worthy of our distrust. Which is to say, we had a ruler with authoritarian tendencies who was quite capable of abusing his power under illegitimate pretense.

And yet we advocated an appropriate and sensible response.

So the idea of a left led by the nose by ideological propensities seems just wrong. Rather, in this instance, the left exhibited what has in recent decades increasingly become its hallmark: A tendency to listen to experts and align with responses that MAKE SENSE. In other words, the left is both informed and rational, and its response is commensurate with the situation at hand.

Which is exactly OPPOSITE  what we see on the right. The only real question is, has it always been thus, or is there something genuinely new?

OF COURSE the left would recoil from a faux ""public health response"" made by an authoritarian as pretense for a nefarious end. But the left is capable of understanding the difference, and that ought not be cause for great surprise. If any single thing demonstrates the essense of the left-right divide, it is rationality versus irrationality."
2021-09-21 10:39:30,I think We also have to stop saying that the right or the left are following or not following the “science”. You see it’s really judgments based on risk tolerance.

As if what divides “moderns” on the collectivist-libertarian axis goes right down to first principles.  It does not! Like all moderns, both left and right, they imagine they are in control.  That manifests itself in different ways, “pull yourself up by your bootstraps”, “follow the science”, etc…but the imaginative conviction is the same.  Of course, that conviction springs from a haunting anxiety which both also share.  That left and right should flip-flop on policy prescriptions, all rooted in the same assumptions, is not “weird” at all.  Is it really so surprising to you that 17th century Florence, then that most “modern” of cities, should have reacted to plague so differently than its peers…well, it is another failure of our times that we lack any sense of historical awareness.

2021-09-21 13:51:43,"Is Ross TRYING to be obtuse or is he just infatuated with some sort of analysis that somehow makes the 'left' authoritarian.?? A true word salad.
The bottom line is that Trump poisoned the well for his supporters. It was 'own the libs' vs the common good.
Covid was initially more devastating to urban areas for obvious reasons - more people living and interacting close together. Democrats are more likely to live in urban areas, be governed by democratic leaders, AND still have a belief in the common good/government.
And no mention of the current Delta variant and how it has impacted his conservative tribe. There has been schadenfreude on both sides - first the Trumpists who were fine with no lockdowns as the biggest impact was to urban democrats. Now that there rural and Republican states are being hammered due to their 'dovish' (more like death cult) policies, a lot of us can't help thinking ' I told you so'. Covid doesn't care about politics - just the policies our state and local governments have / have not put in place. 
The Republican's 40 year effort to undermine government and the common good (vs the government is only there for business and the wealthy) has now born fruit - and is something Ross just can't acknowledge in any of his columns."
2021-09-21 13:52:38,"I don't think there was actually much of a political flip. 
The left has always supported government control (authoritarianism, if you will) in response to actual threats such as Covid, climate change and gun violence. It opposes authoritarianism when it comes to unsubstantiated threats like fear of wide spread terrorism after 9/11 and the Red Scare of the 1950's. 
The right has always supported authoritarianism when it comes to individuals (for example: fighting to outlaw gay marriage and legalization of pot)  but laissez-faire when it comes to businesses.

I sympathize with your experience with misdiagnosis of your lyme disease.  You discovered, I believe, that physicians are not immune to ignorance, nor ideological bias.Why we even have members of Congress who have exemplified those truisms repeatedly.

More;  to take of a couple of historians of medieval literature as examples of a wave of left wing shifts in ideology is a bit of a stretch.  You need not fear - and much research supports this - the right wing remains much closer to authoritarian solutions than the left.  Even with those pre-Covid, anti-vax elitists in the mix, I am sure the numbers will support this conclusion.

The current anti-government ""over reach"" hysterically played out by Republicans simply reflects that the ""over reach"" is simply being reached by the wrong party."
2021-09-21 13:23:19,"Highlighting weird flips, Mr. Douthat has excluded the most weird one of them all - the fact that Trump pivoted from a commanding role on vaccines and taking charge on Covid in general to the Covid-dismissive position.  His initial commanding role in March 2020 might well have won him reelection.  The only people really flipping out about his news conferences at that time were the liberal columnists who were afraid he was going to take too much credit and earn political capital from the government health orders.  The public was as usual looking for reassurance.

How Trump took what would have been his greatest asset and turned it into his greatest weakness by dismissing Covid is one of the great 2020 mysteries.  Was it all just his doing or did someone bend his ear who really was on the wrong track?"

The right has demonstrated a steadfast inability to acknowledge both ambiguity, and the necessary changes made 'on the ground' to fight COVID, and 

2.) Rather than offering solutions as to how the pandemic could reasonably be brought under control, right 'populists' raise questions about the efficacy of the vaccine, masking, and social distancing: that any measures are inadequate, so why bother?  It's as if scientists and health professionals should have been able to immediately put an end to COVID, and because they did not, they are now worthless.  And it is that consistent barrage of fantasy-land, regurgitated right-wing talking points that seems to indicate that what the right wants is mass death, even amongst the right itself.

All of this indicates to me that we are headed into a darker, more dangerous fall and winter season.

2021-09-21 13:07:42,What’s weird is politicizing science in the first place - whether charging an astronomer with heresy in the Italian Renaissance or discussing public health scientists as if they were politicians in Trumpified America.
2021-09-21 14:00:19,"It's important to point out that neither liberals or conservatives are consistent in their points of view. If following the science were truly the way - booster shots would not have been recommended without data to back them up. If individual liberty were truly the way - conservatives (or the unvaccinated) would not seek medical care at hospitals since they would surrender their freedom by following medical orders.

This country seems to be missing a good dose of insight and common sense."
2021-09-21 10:29:19,"I appreciate that Douthat needs to delve into a 17th century response of a small Italian city to the plague in order to assert his usual what-about-ism between the political left an right.  It's essentially an admission that from smoking, to lead pollution, to asbestos, to black lung, to automobile safety, the Left has consistently supported science and advocated for government regulation, while the Right has supported wealthy industries and opposed government interference.  Thank you, Mr. Douthat, for almost laying bare the vacuity of your position."
2021-09-21 14:01:31,"Ross ends with ""I don’t know exactly why or exactly what it means. I just want people to acknowledge that it has happened and it’s really, really weird.""

He should have started the essay with the first of these sentences. And ended it there, too."
2021-09-21 10:21:58,"In my ignorance of the depth of inhumanity inherent in one of the political parties here in America, I embraced the idea that ""big government"" could offer vaccines, paycheck protection and rent coverage, as well as expanded unemployment, to all Americans, irrespective of their socioeconomic class or politics. 

I was unprepared for the cynical and dangerous blocking of all reasonable measure in waves 2-4; for the refusal to fund Medicaid in states where voters had wanted it, for the withdrawal of unemployment benefits, for the handing out of PPP money to ""donor friends"" by friendly banking interests. 

All of the chance that this country had to pull through this more like Florence and less like Venice were blocked by one side and one side only. The ""Left"" never swung anywhere - the science changed and morphed and this is classic in a viral epidemic. And no, I don't worry about authoritarian Democrats destroying my freedom and life. I worry about autocratic GOP leaders doing it, as they have tried to, over and over since 2000, whenever they had power.

I don't know why I click on this column anymore."
2021-09-21 11:02:49,"It is great to want the vaccinated to not wear masks anymore, but the fact is that now we have to wear them because of (mostly the right) not getting vaccinated.  Those who choose not to are responsible for the situation we find ourselves in now and the many illnesses and deaths are their fault."
2021-09-21 10:10:41,"I don't think the ""flip flop"" Ross Douthat notes is all that surprising. When you focus on an end goal, to save lives and protect the community health, you'll have different outcomes than when you focus on the goal of continuing individual rights and keeping the economic engine humming.

My mother was a child of the Depression and the second world war. In that time, our nation accepted - many grudgingly - both social programs to revive the country, and authoritarian restrictions to support the war effort. Some, like the incarceration of Japanese Americans were illegal and wrong. 

But other restrictions were accepted as part of the cost of the emergency. Ration coupons, shortages of goods, and of course, the draft which sent young men off to war whether they were inspired to serve or not.

Like them, we have many Liberals accepting the emergency with the goal of mitigating the harms - to public health, to personal livelihoods. But the right looked first at mitigating economic harm, and in doing so, instead of mitigating social harm, increased it by denying the crisis. No need to worry, folks, it's all a hoax. Now get out there and vote GOP!.

Which take is more authoritarian? One that uses lies to get you to do their bidding, or one in which we collectively agree to a level of sacrifice to get through a crisis?"
2021-09-21 12:01:47,"I think Douthat found the wrong key, probably because he was looking under the very convenient lamp post of Trump. The roots of the right's disdain for masks and vaccines has deeper roots in the Evangelical insistence on the literal truth of the Bible. They've spent decades denying evolution as the fossils and DNA evidence piled up and that denial has sown a deep defiance in the face of objective truth.

Unfortunately, that defiance of science has now been transferred to the CDC and FDA. The consequences are clear. Hospitals are overrun, children are orphaned and life cannot get back to normal for anyone because so many people refuse to recognize basic scientific truths about how airborne viruses spread."
2021-09-21 14:04:44,"The logic in this column doesn't even track.  The author is trying to admit that the liberals who sought to follow the science were right, but he just can't.
 If children had gone beck to school in the fall of 2020, they would have been taught, fed and cleaned up after by unvaccinated adults. We have learned in the past few months how easily the Delta variant infects-and kills, children. Perhaps the rigorous isolation of children from March 2020 until summer 2021 is what protected them until adults around them were vaccinated.
There was no vaccination available for the 17th century plague, the first effective vaccine (against smallpox) was developed in 1796 over one hundred years later.
The author would be more effective if he would just state that the Republican Party is wrong and is, in effect, putting its own members at risk. But he can't let go of his beliefs that an authoritarian government (that tracks with his own personal/religious views) is the government he really wants, no matter how many have to die to keeps his hopes alive."
2021-09-21 14:06:08,"""The right's sense of marginalization,"" a favorite phrase of Mr. Douthat, is one of the most duplicitous tropes circulating around our political landscape and a phony excuse for vaccination reluctance. 

The ""right"" is more than 90% white and, last I checked, white people controlled the vast majority of wealth in this country, lived in by far the nicest homes and neighborhoods, had the best access to healthcare, and controlled most state houses and governorships. Oh, and since 2000, it has shared the presidency in terms of years with Democrats and now dominates the Supreme Court.

That's the farthest thing from marginalization. What the right really wants is to keep other groups marginal and that's about race and power."
2021-09-21 14:06:42,"Like Ross Douthat my views on what response is appropriate has changed over time partly because of new information and partly because of a lessening of my initial fear of the disease. For example, it looks like the initial fear that I shared which closed schools may have been an over reaction because we did not know enough about transmission in children and the effectiveness of masks.  We have also learned that different societies have found diferent ways to deal with the Pandemic. Taiwan, New Zealand and others were able to make strict lockdowns work while other nations like U.S. thrashed in the attempt because of political conflict.  

The important thing to realize is that as new information emerges we can and should change how we deal with the virus.  Societies also need to adopt strategies that work best for them.  This seems to be much more difficult than it should be.  People complain every time the CDC changes advice based on new data.  The politicisation of the pandemic has also caused people to take rigid positions despite new information.  So people complain about changes in policy ascribing it to incompetence or a mendacious plot to take away our freedoms.  In the end it is a sad commentary on the divisive society we live in"
2021-09-21 14:08:55,"Tangentially related, while we're on the subject of centuries-old writings about Italian cities, there's a fascinating description by Casanova of dealing with quarantine there, I think in Venice.  In particular, there was a requirement--during the mid 1700s--for the separately-quarantined to remain at least 6 feet apart, the exact same recommendation the CDC made early in our pandemic."
2021-09-21 14:13:04,"As a liberal I’ve thought about the contradiction Douthat poses. He might have also mentioned the ACLU’s defense of Covid restrictions when the organization had previously opposed some similar measures. Of course, Covid has been worse than SARS and others turned out to be. But it’s important to note that the restrictions are justified because the benefits outweigh the costs, not because those costs don’t exist."
2021-09-21 12:30:31,"An interesting opinion, but the bodies are piling up going towards two years into the war. We basically have two countries in the United States. 
The Confederacy  is led by Donald Trump, who was born rich, but failed even in making a buck in gambling casinos. As his troops die like flies from disease, they still follow their great white leader. The rest of the States have moved beyond coal, oil, and the divining rod. The last gaspers are basically dying at he other side. Their mass medical fever camps are reminiscent of the mass suicides  by hundreds of thousands Japanese after losing WWII.
 At least  their Emperor did not spend most of his time on golf course during that death march, but helped rebuild the county.  Confederates will never do this."
2021-09-21 12:49:47,"""Maybe the key is the absolute power of partisanship and polarization, in which once Donald Trump chose Covid-minimizing rhetoric, everybody else just rushed into their places.""

It's not too often the simple explanation seems like the correct explanation, but this feels like one of those times. Prior to Covid it always appeared to me that anti-vax sentiments lived on the political left...at least, all the people I knew who were anti-vax were on the far left end of the political spectrum. But once Donald Trump adopted his unfortunate position, the sides were quickly chosen and separated, and here we are today. Our country used to draft young men to fight and die in countries thousands of miles away in ill-conceived wars, and it was the political right that argued it was one's patriotic duty to sacrifice one's life for such a cause. Now that same part of the political spectrum won't even put a piece of cloth over their face, feeling that is too much for their government to ask of them. What a silly species we are."
2021-09-21 14:12:49,"It has much less to do with politics than common sense, trusting scientists, care for the weakest amongst us and simple survival.￼"
2021-09-21 14:10:07,"I think you miss read the motivations.
The left is motivated to try use government to fix perceived problems whether it is limiting the spread of covid, limiting the use of force against black people by police, or trying to limit global warming.  (I could go on.)
The instincts open the right armor laissez-faire.  Intervention doesn't work out can even be pernicious.  Leave it alone.
Pick your poison."
2021-09-21 11:26:43,"Your entire essay boils down to an assertion that you are right and have been right the whole way through. It reads first and foremost as justification and defense of a previous essay which made incredible leaps of logic and was founded on wild assumption. 

Very, very weird indeed."
2021-09-21 12:21:06,"Ross, you seem to be throwing spaghetti thoughts at the wall to see if they stick. Instead, you've ended up with a poor man's Jackson Pollock, on the floor.

If Trump had done the right thing by taking the coronavirus seriously, I certainly wouldn't have rebelled and refused to wear a mask, though I'm certainly anti-Trump. As a rational human being, I realize that this virus poses a real and present danger to all of us, until enough of us are,vaccinated that it doesn't have the capacity to spread. That is not a left or right position, I am simply looking at the evidence.

So what forces have caused us to be in this horrible position vis a vis the virus?

It ends with Covid spewing Karens, but the start was obviously Trump disregarding and overriding scientific evidence. It was not benign. Some poor weather forecaster from NOAA was threatened with being fired for letting the people of Alabama know a hurricane was not headed their way. Instead of laughing it off, Trump actually displayed a map where he used a Sharpie to extend the projected path.

Unfortunately, he was in charge of the executive branch of the US government, and quickly shut down any science he could. Millions of people have followed him down this rabbit hole of misinformation.

That about sums it up. It's not about left-right, it's about rational-irrational."
2021-09-21 14:16:54,I guess what disturbs me most is how each side has hardened its position now cast in concrete. I think mask regulations can be loosened in highly vaccinated places and tightened where the virus is still spreading and yet the people who live in my white liberal neighborhood are very strict about masking even though it's not really necessary. It's the thought conformity on each side that I find most depressing. We should be able to trust each individual to make a sensible decision in light of circumstances but that trust simply doesn't exist anymore.
2021-09-21 13:26:48,"No what is really, really, weird, is segments of our population, most of which, have been vaccinated as a child, have received some kind of prescription, have been treated by a physician for a health problem, decides, in the middle of pandemic killing millions, that medical measures to mitigate the spread of he virus, is some kind of Marxists plot or denial of their god given right to infect their neighbors---now that is weird."
2021-09-21 14:17:12,"It seems obvious to me that liberals have (pretty much always) cared about the greater good, while conservatives have prioritized themselves and the wellbeing of their own tribes over the wellbeing of others in society. So the left supporting public health measures that require some level of personal sacrifice but result in protecting people–even people they don't know–makes perfect sense. The expectation that conservatives would care about protecting the vulnerable? That's not the party I know."

Further, a glance back at the Progressive Era reveals the ideological basis of our pandemic response. Nineteenthth-century ""liberals"" like social Darwinist William Graham Sumner would be cheering on the anti-maskers from their ample stone graves, while Progressive reformers would champion the Biden administration's reliance on science, experts, power, and regulation for the common good. Only the unique mid-20th-century realignment of these core ideologies -- an aberration noted and explained by too many to name here -- obscures this."

2021-09-21 14:18:50,"I believe that Mr. Douthat is misunderstanding the left/right dynamic.  It is not nearly what he suggests.  The real difference is what's at stake.  Liberals often get accused of being for big government.  And so we are when the subject is public health and welfare.  We are certainly supportive of government actions to fight disease, prevent contamination of the environment, protect the food chain, etc., even when it puts some burden on individuals.  That is where conservatives, by contrast, mostly assert the small government mantra.  But if the topic shifts -- for example to immigration, or taxes, or security, the perspective shifts.  This is not a matter of differeing views on government as much as it is different values.  Liberals tend to believe that restictions on individual action, especially if modest, are appropriate where piblic welfare is at stake.  Over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court agreed.  Conservatives generally exalt freedom in this context, but not in the context of national security.  

Any remaining restrictions on liberty are quite modest.  Wearing a mask is no burden, and experience shows we relaxed the requirements to much, too soon.  I just returned from two countries in Europe, where I wore a mask up to 15 hours a day.  No big deal.  I also had to show my vaccination card, and sometimes my negative test results, to enter restaurants, churches, and museums.  Those were certainly a fair price for being able to enter those places without much concern."

After Trump was elected, my friends and I made a concerted effort to understand the concerns of Trump voters. We came away with the realization that it was a waste of time. We aren't going to satisfy them because we aren't going to do what they want. If it was only a matter of economic inequality, that could be addressed. But it is racism, Q-believing, anti-LGBTQ, control over women's bodies, and owning the libs. There is no middle ground, no matter Biden's valiant but apparently failing attempt to stake it out."

2021-09-21 14:19:27,"""I just want people to acknowledge that it has happened and it’s really, really weird.""

I willingly acknowledge that incredible stupidity is rampant and infects the thinking of left and right regarding covid in various harmful ways.  But in comparison to the other genuinely bizarre things that have happened in the U.S. in the past five years, I'm not sure I'd go so far as ""really, really weird.""  Maybe just one ""really,"" if that.

I do know this with certainty:  one of my best, lifelong friends contracted polio when he was a little boy and unvaccinated at that stage of his life.  He loves baseball, but he could never play the game.  He likes to fish, but if it required negotiating a steep bank to reach the water, he passed.  We traveled together to San Francisco in the mid-'70s and, as adventurous as he was given his physical handicap, he was very reluctant to ride the cablecars because he didn't want to inconvenience others who would have to wait while he tried to climb aboard.  Today, he can't go to the bathroom in the middle of the night without first putting on huge braces because his legs bones are like cooked spaghetti.

In short, his life was forever altered -- and a timely inoculation could have precluded that.  So argue with your shifting consciousness all you want, Mr. Douthat.  Just don't confuse your intellectual purity exercise with the imperative for all of us to protect ourselves through the simple act of inoculation."
2021-09-21 13:11:23,"Watch how the propagandist finds an outlier opinion,from what he calls left leaning, and then pretends that his outlier represents the left majority.

Also amusing was Douthat's swipe at expert opinion in an opinion piece of all places.

Trumpists and tag-a-log conservatives have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. The anti-vaccine libertarians have become a menace to society, but they vote for Trump and his minions. So the right must support the insupportable.

Only in America."
2021-09-21 13:31:41,Perverse incentives and hypocrisy every day on Covid. Why is it that Canada approved mixing vaccine types after no analysis whatsoever and the U.S. and Europe don't recommend or practice this Covid policy. Why is it that many OBGYNs are quietly dissuading their pregnant patients not to get vaccinated? Why are we getting booster shots when most of the poor around the world haven't gotten a single shot? Why did the CDC change its mask guidance  for K-12 schools from no masks to masks after the teachers' unions pressured them to do so?
2021-09-21 14:21:32,"""I think mask requirements should have mostly gone away with widespread vaccination""
Foolishness, Ross.  Even if fully vaccinated, wear a mask in public!  And especially children in school should wear masks.  My nine year old grandson wears an American flag mask and he looks like a super hero!  He doesn't complain at all."
2021-09-21 10:27:25,"""And more recently many Republicans have let reasonable doubts about vaccine mandates undercut their commitment to finding ways, by hook or crook, to get as many people vaccinated as possible.""

What ""reasonable"" doubts, Ross Douthat?  That vaccines aren't safe (wrong), that vaccines cause impotence (wrong), that vaccines can't be any good because they were developed too quickly (wrong, they had a decade's head start)???

I found this column maddening because for me the facts are simple.  A public health crisis demands a quick, rapid, and above all consistent approach.  It's sickening that if Mississippi were a country, it would be #2 in Covid mortality ahead only of Peru.

That a country as rich as ours has had more deaths than most of the developed world says more about our politics--folks are willing to die to support their tribe--than it does abour our scientific achievements.."
2021-09-21 12:56:14,"Douthat seems to be going through an existential crisis because the positions of political parties don't align with some high-minded ideas of what are supposed to be bedrock principles.  He still thinks the right in this country has some guiding set of beliefs that animate policy.  Instead, they have a leadership class who pay lip service to populism but govern like they want a hellscape of libertarianism for the masses and a steady stream of generous welfare programs for their elites.  On social issues they want to take us back to the middle ages.  It's a schizophrenic set of positions that can't be reconciled with any philosophy or romantic ideal of what was once a rational through line on the right."
2021-09-21 12:50:11,"It's not weird at all, what's weird is this preponderance of Foucault devotion purported to permeate the entire left. The reason the current left is more inclined to trust experts on Covid is because their politics are inherently inclusive and they are invested in that inclusiveness because they know that ultimately it is also what is best for themselves. The current right doesn't trust experts because their politics are inherently xenophobic (demonstrably, and localized, not just a fear of foreigners). It boils down to disenfranchisement and economic disparity: several generations have now grown up watching the rich get richer and themselves poorer and less secure. When you have fewer and fewer reasons to buy into the system that governs you, you're far more likely to feel victimized and alienated and lose faith in that system. If Foucault's critiques are no longer a salient feature of left-wing thinking, it's probably because his inherent paranoia is untenable for anyone who still has hope that the generations who won't do as well as their parents did will fare better than feared, and because of Trump we've finally got a direct taste of how bad things can get, and how quickly, akin to so many other younger generations in countries far less fortunate or functional that understandably wouldn't give Foucault a second thought. Foucault is a silly luxury of tenured PhDs. Most of us who read him in college have real problems to contend with."
2021-09-21 13:48:47,"This is an odd column. Here's why. The proper perspective to consider the role of a deadly pathogen is that of the pathogen. A blind, deaf, and dumb entity that seeks only to propagate itself. Our role, while hardly irrelevant, is not nearly so significant as that of the pathogens, which (pardon the anthropocentrism) has a single desire. To eat human lungs. The best way to thwart that goal is to make human lungs unsavory for the pathogen (via vaccines); to restrict access to human lungs (via masking); and replace the multi-lane freeways that enable to pathogen to travel with impunity with gravel roads (via social distancing). Taken together, these three activities -- vaccines, masks, distancing -- will end the pandemic."
2021-09-21 09:42:19,"On the editorial pages here everything is viewed through the lens of politics.

In my opinion it's easier to understand covid by looking at how people perceive and react to risk.

I have two friends.  One is a hang glider pilot.  One is a photographer.  

When the pilot stands on a mountain peak she watches the birds soaring and is pulled by the allure of flying with them.  She knows the risks.  But to her not flying would meaning giving up everything.

When the photographer stands on a mountain peak she sees how sky and land come together.  She is content to stand and watch, waiting for the perfect moment to take a picture.  

We all have different ways of living.  We all perceive risk differently.  a covid fatality rate of less than 1% is nowhere near the 50% rates mentioned here.  To some this risk is acceptable.  To others it is not.

We should all try to understand why we are different, and maybe give each other some more space.  And sometimes this does mean segregating ourselves."
2021-09-21 14:22:42,"I think the answer to Mr. Douthat's conundrum is that it is all about ""identity politics"". He doesn't even begin to mention how Donald Trump totally ignored virtually all Republican principles. The Republican Party stands for nothing meaningful right now - just owning the libs, anti-vaxism, and the Big Lie. At least there are some political leaders on the other side who are trying to do something positive for the country, but they are being held back to some degree by grandstanders, opportunists, and culture cancellers in their ranks. We have a lot of problems, and for the most part, Pres. Biden seems to be working on some of them, while trying to avoid meaningless arguments over irrelevancies, unlike the former guy. A big part of the blame goes to the Atwater-Gingrich approach to politics that began more than 30 years ago. A lot of it goes to tech companies whose algorithms will do anything to keep people clicking. Some of it goes to cable channels that peddle constant aggravation to keep eyeballs. Some of it belongs with various actors who exploit all of this for their own personal gain, or to drag our nation down to their level (I'm looking at you, Vlad). This ecosystem is so entrenched and widespread that it will take years before it begins to fade. I pray it doesn't bring down America, and maybe even civilization, with it."
2021-09-21 12:54:45,"Interesting piece. I am sure that Trump's posture had a lot to do with initial positions and polarization on measures. 

But there is something else at play here: Ignorance. 

Proud, unabashed ignorance, mixed with social support and rejection of expert opinion. 

Ross omits an important part of his comparison. citizens of 17th century Florence had little information about many things and poor means of transmission of such information. In such circumstances, the liberal poor were least informed and the authoritarian rich were better informed. Authoritarian government used information to  impose measures based on expert opinion.

Today, the government is democratic and there is plenty of information. Detailed information. Fact based and expert interpreted information. So the government acts based on that and liberal/democratic portion of the society is strongly pro such measures. 

In our case the authoritarians are the poorly informed, ignorant, undereducated and typically mistrustful of liberal elite. The right wing populist leaders have to a tough challenge. They are well informed and educated (typically). They, themselves, have taken all the measures. But they have to ACT like they are against the measures in order to maintain political support. Which turns them into obvious hypocrites and I'm sure causes major cognitive dissonance. Imagine working for Fox and following all protocols and then getting on the air and railing against them."

2021-09-21 14:32:07,"To sum-up Mr. Douthat's article would be to simply say America has lost it's way (or mind for that matter). We used to be an ambitious, hard-working, disciplined & science centric populace whereas political considerations were secondary to the greater good. 

Today, America is two warring tribes with leaders utterly incapable of compromise and pursuing the greater good. This pandemic has a cure and nearly half our citizens refuse to be cured...that is just plain lunacy..."
2021-09-21 14:34:58,"Interesting to note the varying degrees of distance from reality of Douthat's summary of our polarization:
A) The left's sense that the right is just a pro-Covid death cult; and  
B) The right’s sense that the left wants us all to mask up and eat Soylent in our disease-free habitats.

Looking at reality, the left wants masks and vaccines, while the right wants freedom to not mask and not take vaccines. ICUs are filled with those dying because they have followed the right's campaign of division. Meanwhile, no policy maker has proposed Soylent or sterilized bunkers. One side of this reality is much closer to Douthat's supposedly hyperbolic characterizations. ""A"" is pretty much how things are, while ""B"" is a straw man argument to scare people and keep them supporting the GOP."
2021-09-21 14:32:26,"It is no great revelation that Trump plays Russian roulette with other people heads, and the GOP covers the carnage. These people make Joe McCarthy's rampage look benign. Trump Tower Moscow will be their legacy, and headstone for everyone else."
2021-09-21 14:31:11,The fact of the matter is that the Biden Administration is putting restrictions and mandates on everyone but the people flowing across the southern border.
2021-09-21 14:35:38,"Republicans, who espouse their unshakable belief in Capitalism and market theory, of which a basic tenet is that people are rational actors that make rational choices based upon calculations and information that is available to them, are the one's who have flipped.

The actions of so many Republicans are anything but rational, when individuals refuse Covid-19 vaccinations that have proven to be safe and effective for millions of people around the world.  When Republican governors repudiate simple measures that can save their constituents' live and help keep their economies lively, such as wearing masks when indoors.  

It is not rational when large swathes of Republicans balk at getting scientifically proven safe and effective vaccines to engage in activities that allow them to keep their jobs, protect themselves and their loved ones from sickness and possible death, and to safely interact with the rest of society and do the things that they enjoy doing.

It is irrational for people who claim to care about their children's health to protest against obvious safety and mindlessly easy precautions put into place to protect their children's health, like wearing a lightweight mask and getting vaccinations to protect against getting a disease that has killed millions and is running rampant in society.

You are half-correct in your analysis, Ross:  there has been some flipping done but it has wholly been the Republicans who have flipped.  Extremely weird politics of Covid, indeed."
2021-09-21 14:28:43,"""Weird"" may not be the right word to describe what is happening. Large and complicated would be my choices.  Like Ross, I am tired of people offering sound bite sized, unified field theories of why the other side is wrong or stupid. The left-right ""flip"" that Ross observed seems more like an adjustment to the changing facts of a massive event. No one in 2020 was projecting the Delta variant in all its specifics although it was obviously a strong possibility, given viral evolution.  Just imagine a world where the vaccines didn't work.  No one, not even Dr/St Fauci, had the necessary intellectual tools, communication skills and clairvoyance to map this all out in advance. And it's still rolling."
2021-09-21 14:37:36,"I read how the Danes have opened up due to effective Covid mitigation resulting from a trust in government and authority figures like our  CDC. As a liberal I have long recognized that we need effective government to regulate and moderate such a large group of people as are the citizens of the USA. Douthat has it backwards in my view since it is the right that flies the Gadsden flag ""Don't Tread on Me"" which is a literal rebuke to government authority and the efforts to create a balance of rights vs. responsibilities."
2021-09-21 14:37:38,"""....which is why the right briefly favored restrictions when they seemed likely to fall mainly on foreigners and the left briefly suspended its zeal for restrictions when the transgressors were left-wing protesters instead of anti-mask Republicans.....""

The difference between Black Lives Matter protesters and the anti-mask republicans is that for the most part BLM protests observed masking and were held outdoors. As far as I know none was ever found to be a super-spreader event. Trump's unmasked White House""celebration"" of the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett and his campaign events, by contrast, were such events. And let's not forget the Sturgis rally spreading Covid far and wide. 

And, really, how can a single book be held up as representing overall progressive thought? I haven't read the book, but should it be held up as advocating secretly dancing or otherwise flouting public health measure in the midst of our own deadly pandemic?

A final thought: after several years of shared sacrifice, Americans came out of the restrictions and rationing of WWII into a time of economic prosperity (noting of course that women, people of color, etc did not share equally in the prosperity and embarked on years of resistance that rightly continue to this day). I dearly hope that someday we may emerge from the pandemic into a healthy, more equitable, and indeed more prosperous time."
2021-09-21 14:24:33,"Mr Douthat, I am sorry but you are kind of skirting around the real issue. For all the length of this column, you take pains to show you were more hawkish on covid than your fellow conservatives. we all get that and it does not mean much. However you come right back and chastise the left for embracing policies that are, in your words, ""stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian"". This is exactly where you are wrong, IMO. We need stringent policies as a response to pandemic and emergencies and not for random run-of-the mill manufactured crisis. We have had stringent vaccination requirements all along for many diseases - the only difference in Covid case is this - your fellow conservatives allegiance to trump. It is not libertarian, it is lunatic."
2021-09-21 14:39:25,The left is generally pro- science and pro social responsibility. The right is anti-science and pro-selfishness. It surprises me that Ross is so slow to realize this.
2021-09-21 14:36:07,"What you left out was the polarization of right and left over science. Those of us on the left looked at the science reported from Dr. Fauci and other scientists at the CDC and WHO and saw the data showed masking and social distancing/quarantining were the ways to not get and spread COVID until the vaccines came out. We did that even when the CDC's and Fauci's recommendations changed b/c they were based on SCIENTIFIC research. We noted that Sweden's attempt at herd immunity without quarantining or social distancing failed - it has a much higher rate of COVID infection and deaths than its neighbors. 

We on the left hate having to quarantine and to close everything down. No one wants that. But we all saw that the we had to take those measures b/c of the science. Trump, an expert on sowing division, made it into a political issue, especially mask-wearing, and most of the Republican Party decided people getting sick and dying was worth scoring political points and some votes. It's happening in my rural Upstate NY area - the Republican state representatives, one of whom is a respiratory therapist is gleefully leading anti-mask rallies. All of that is causing people to get sick, die, spread the virus, and cause strong mutations of the virus to form.

That's not libertarianism; that is homicidal madness."
2021-09-21 13:19:35,"""stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian and inevitably ratify various forms of inequality and social control.""
•
Hey.  Just about any policy can be described as authoritarian with inequitable impact."
2021-09-21 14:41:15,I think Trump wanted to downplay the virus because he was afraid that lockdowns would hurt the economy and damage his re-election campaign. So he tacked one way and his opponents the other. In Sweden a left wing government took a more libertarian approach to the pandemic. In that country the Conservative party called for stricter measures.
2021-09-21 12:35:58,"I think some veneers of left and right have flipped, like a magnetic pole reversal.  In my mind it goes back to when ""fake news"" and scorn of ""the narrative"" became mantras of conspiracy-minded (and I think proto-fascist) rightwingers, while lefties started wearing T shirts that say ""facts matter."" That preceded covid but was supercharged by the pandemic.  I'm inclined to think that the left is more supple and nuanced in positions.  I'm also inclined to think that that makes the left more scattered and fragile in the US than the passionate rightwing, who seize on left-based critiques of certain official institutional ""narratives"" but produce really cruel and even self-destructive results.  I guess that supports the argument about American Jacksonian tendencies.  Too bad; it won't vanish anytime soon."
2021-09-21 12:38:38,"I’m not sure how much of a “flip” there has been as much of a hardening of right wing attitudes and behavior that coincided with Biden’s election, and ironically enough, the release of successful vaccines. Animosity toward Biden and Democrats has led far too many people on the right to defy science and common sense. Our hospitals are overwhelmed and far too many Americans have gotten sick and died because Republicans insist on doing the opposite of whatever the Democrats are trying to accomplish, and hope to position the Biden administration as a failure."
2021-09-21 14:44:10,"Ross, I like 17th Century Italy as much as the next guy, but let's look a bit closer to home. Let's do a thought experiment: What if, in February 2020 Donald Trump had said, ""This is serious folks, it's real, it's a threat to America. Every real American will mask up, in fact we're distributing fifty million MAGA masks. Anyone unmasked in public is either a terrorist or a socialist."" How would the Covid landscape look today?"
2021-09-21 11:55:49,"As someone with 16 years of Jesuit education, I can’t help but wonder if drawing major (often laughably incorrect) generalizations based on categorical essentialism is a Catholic thing or not. Mr Douthat, clearly you’ve noted that in the real world your thesis suffers from two things: 1) There is no American left, there is only a libertarian right and everyone else. 2) Even if there was an American left, we wouldn’t be able to predict their actual behaviors based on analyses of political philosophy.

To borrow an idea from Wittgenstein, these misanalyses could be avoided by taking seriously a criticism of our ‘obsession with generalizations’ and having a look at reality before our pseudo-Platonic models of political behavior."
2021-09-21 14:46:42,"Ross views switched to the demands of the conservatives around him. 

The Left has been pretty consistent throughout. And can point to tons of places in the world that have fared better because they didn’t have to deal with Ross."
2021-09-21 14:53:15,"Bumbling through the pandemic.  This is he fundamental misunderstanding of critics.  

There is a reason they call this a novel virus.  We never saw it before 2019/2020.  Nobody knew how it would behave, and it has been teaching us ever since.

Upset because of messaging on booster shots? Well, there's a simple reason.  The only way to know whether people need the 8 months or a year later is to wait 8 months or a year to see what happens.  Now, we could have delayed distribution to see what happened in clinical trials.  Would you have rather done that?

This is just one example. Folks, we are all in one big experiment. For the anti-vaxxers, you're in it too as the control group. This isn't bumbling. Its learning.  Want to know what a better strategy is? Come back in ten years."

If you had asked me before this all began if there should be vaccine mandated by the government and strict isolation and quarantine policies in the presence of a pandemic, I would have said that an authoritarian approach is the way to go. My views haven’t changed. I think the more progressive folks are just more likely to pay attention to science and public health needs. There is a difference in not wanting an authoritarian government to police our lives and wanting a more authoritarian approach in the presence of a public health threat."
2021-09-21 13:54:42,Wear a mask.  Don't make us ask.
2021-09-21 14:57:17,"So  much babble wrapped in a bubble. 

As someone on the left, my view is that we strive to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In a pandemic, that means getting vaccinated and wearing a mask.

But because those on the right hate science, but hate us on the left even more, we limp along. 

Yesterday, I spoke with a woman in the office of Nebraska governor, Pete Ricketts, after I saw a clip of him on ""Meet the Press"" about how the reason that other vaccines are mandated in Nebraska for kids - polio, measles, tetanus, Hepatitis B, etc. is that ""they've been around for a long time and parents trust them"". I reminded the governor's officer that at one time, ALL of those vaccines were new. 

 The governor then basically said, ""Look I believe in the vaccine and I think people should get vaccinated, but if Joe Biden tell them the HAVE to be vaccinated, they won't.""

The right has lost its mind and its killing rest of us."
2021-09-21 14:58:49,"The appearance of Covid in early 2020, and its subsequent shutting down of travel, business, school, etc. was something the that Trump feared, because he was in power and this virus was ruining his economy. 

Therefore he downplayed the virus, inviting people to flout masks, to question and ridicule Dr. Fauci, to claim that all sorts of unproven things might cure Covid.  He combined it all with an irrational flag waving fervor that incited violence, anger and madness.

All along practically everyone of sane mind knew that masks prevented transmission of the virus. So if you wore a mask you were fighting the spread of Covid. 

Now we have vaccinations. If you get one you are much less likely to end up in the hospital or seriously ill. But Biden is in power, so to prolong and mess up his term, Republicans are working to help spread Covid by refusing vaccinations, making up conspiracies, and going maskless. All in the hope that Biden will ""fail"" and Trump can come back as the 2024 savior of America. 

Trump and his supporters are above all only concerned about the virus because it toppled him from power. It was truly a historical accident,  for he would have been reelected if the economy were going strong and there was no virus. 

That is the bottom line."
2021-09-21 14:54:09,"The answer is that this should never have been politicized at all.

To dwell on a ""flip"" is to legitimize the notion that political philosophy should control the science of public health.

It should not. When well over ninety percent of the deaths are among people who deliberately chose not to be vaccinated, are we supposed to take that seriously, as a legitimate ""political"" position? 

No, these people did not suffer and die, leaving family behind, for FREEDOM. 

They died for a con. They followed psychopathic grifters. There is no legitimate political philosophy at play."
2021-09-21 15:00:56,"This again? 

Your career is a study in rationalization and shifting views based on convenience and defense mechanisms. This is all projection. Your writing over the last ten years is the best place I know to understand those things, especially since they involve areas much more clear cut than trying to figure out the best way to deal with a virus know one knew anything about."
2021-09-21 15:01:04,"Well, that essay took an ugly turn.
Political theory in rational human beings - what Douthat refers to as the Left or Doves - gets trumped by public health every time, as well it should in a time of pandemic.
It is the Trump right wing fanatics that are too inflexible to admit the reality of desperate times requiring desperate measures that has prolonged this pandemic into yet another year and perhaps an even more perilous time to come - we are already on the lambda mutation, not that far from the Omega Virus and all that Omega implies.
Just get your vaccination and then lets work this all out when COVID-19 goes away."

In fact, ""dancing their way through the plague year"" may have meant catching and spreading the disease. Being young as they are, they probably won't die of the disease, but how about all the people come in contact with? These teenagers might be asymptomatic spreaders. Don't their older relatives and friends wish to survive too?

2021-09-21 12:20:16,"A better comparison is the Middle Ages, not Renaissance Italy.

The Trump dogma is leading the way for a large part of the nation that has depended on superstition and non-medical remedies. TV and internet(the mob) support this regression of the species.

During the Bubonic Plague many thought that stench would prevent the spread and one does not like to imagine how that worked out. They acted on ignorance. Yet today people are taking poisons and horse deworming medication and Trump's early remedies were based more on magic than science. They are not ignorant of science but they chose to ignore it.

So you had a president and now many governors fighting against science. What happened to the Age of Reason?

Roughly, what we call the Left of the 60's fell into two camps: 

the postmodernists with Foucault at their helm, who questioned any and every centralized authority - be it the State, science, or religion

 - and the classical Marxist Left, which concentrated on class struggle and by and large supported highly centralized Communist regimes.

The classical Marxists warned of the day when postmodernism would swallow itself whole - see the evidence today in the lack of Truth, social media, etc. Likewise, the postmodern Left warned of the day when for example Tiananmen Square would happen.

What we may be seeing is this internecine tension playing out..."
2021-09-21 13:44:54,"Holy what-about-isms Batman! Lately, Mr. Douthat's articles have become fine examples of tautological contortions attempting to defend the indefensible. Ross is an intelligent person and has to know at his core that the GOP response to the pandemic, racism, abortion, climate change and economics is not based in science or reason but instead on obstructionism and stirring up the fear of its base as a means for a minority to control the majority. Yet his pen can't help from engaging in these convoluted arguments that instead of supporting his position serve to weaken it through lack of compelling evidence.  Time to admit the moral failure of conservatism in America Mr. Ross."
2021-09-21 13:03:20,"Ross has certainly done it again.  Twisted COVID in to a both sides did it argument.  There are many anti-Vaxxers on the left.  From what I can tell they were here well before COVID.

Is it a social glue, which keeps society together or just a veneer of politeness, the obsequious face of a conman? I've had my two vaccinations plus the booster. Wearing a mask is a bit uncomfortable for me since I'm a mouth breather.

Let’s rewind just even in my lifetime: the push for universal healthcare; women’s right to choose; combating the AIDs epidemic. All causes of the left. All in the name of public heath.

The only shift has been in the widespread accessibility of solid science, to which the left subscribes, and the widespread accessibility of Fox et. al., to which the right subscribes, thus driving American against American and leaving everyone to dig in their heals. 

Instead of scratching your head that a bunch of science-literates support vaccine mandates, why not scratch your head that the right refuses to learn anything from anything, let alone history?"

2021-09-21 15:06:41,"Isn't the politics of covid more easily explained as the right seeing themselves as rugged individualists who are tough, free thinking, and primarily concerned with their own liberty, while the left is far more interested in doing what is best for the community, relying on experts and collective action, making them more willing to suffer small restraints on their liberty in the short run for the greater good."
2021-09-21 15:07:28,"Any liberal (of left-leaning political actor) worth their salt understands that one of the key duties of government is to curb the transmission of communicable diseases. Nobody on the left denies the fact that public health measures are authoritarian but we also understand that the higher the level of compliance with stuff like mask and vaccine mandates, the sooner we can end the pandemic and drop the public health measures. Cincinnatus was granted exceptional powers to crush revolts in Rome, but more than once relinquished those powers after the revolts had been defeated (though I admit sympathy for the rebels who were fighting for equal protection of the rule of law). I suspect the worries about governments not dropping emergency measures after the crisis has passed is projection (since that's what the right would do).

As a final note 

""But the quarantine was also inevitably punitive and authoritarian, and Maglaque’s review details the way public health restrictions reproduced and deepened inequality and how already-disfavored groups""

You don't get to cut taxes for billionaires and corporations, oppose the very idea of a progressive tax system, and then pretend you care about income and wealth inequality."
2021-09-21 15:08:10,"Calling out baloney every time it shows up in politics would be tedious but I think this is interesting and appreciate Douthat's return to give a more explicit presentation here.

Curiously the outcry over the shortage of covid testing was not followed by a similar outcry over the failure to use the results in an effective tracing program. It seemed intended to highlight the Trump administration's incompetence and to satisfy personal curiosity. Admittedly the results added to the data set but the ""tracing"" was left to the discretion of each individual."
2021-09-21 15:08:29,"Ross, you are incorrect in your conflation of the left's disdain for authoritarianism with vaccines and other proven public health measures.  Only those on the fringes of the left have been anti-vax and anti-science.  Most of those of us who are moderate liberals follow public health advice that is rooted in scientific rigor.  Data and science are what drove this group to follow public health recommendations including wearing masks, social distancing, and getting vaccinated.  Until you understand that, you will fail to understand a large majority of America's response.  

Additionally, Republicans were not guided by any sort of ""reasonable"" doubts on vaccines.  The data overwhelming proved that vaccines are safe and effective. The data on the effectiveness of social distancing and masks is also clear - they work!  Statements by public officials (and OpEd writers) that sow doubt, or enforce doubt, are often rooted in conspiracy theories (or are pandering to those who want to believe them), and are quite simply a danger to public health.  

If you want to focus on anything weird it is this - people have been willing to believe any kind of nonsense from the internet rather than science that has saved and improved lives for a century."

The free markets gave us vaccines but the government in 2020 should have given us masks and tests, but for Trump. All the rest is rewriting history."

2021-09-21 15:16:08,"Ross might spend some time contemplating the situation in Western Australia, which is neither of his extremes. Authorities there closed the borders at once when the first inklings of the pandemic emerged. They ordered strict quarantines for the infected and pursued rigorous contact-tracing to identify persons exposed, who were required in turn to quarantine.

The result, as a friend of mine in Perth reports: no one wears masks; schools have been open; sports stadiums are packed; bars, cafes, and night clubs operate as usual. Maria and Cammila dance to their hearts' content.

Australia now is facing some potentially divisive conflict between a federal government that wants to reopen the country and states resistant, WA most fervidly. A botched vaccine program has further roiled the debate. But you can't deny that the initial response--fast, efficient, and thorough--saved uncounted lives with minimal social disruption. As of today WA has seen a daily rate of about 1092 cases and 9 deaths, or an annual death rate of about 0.00126%."

Read it carefully, and you will see that Ross Douthat continues to spread COVID misinformation--and not that stealthily either.  I am on my last week of my NYT subscription, and until then, I intend to call-out COVID misinformation and false equivalencies every chance I get."
2021-09-21 15:23:14,"It's pretty simple.  The Left generally trusts science and experts.  The Right hates science and experts, and anyone else who ""looks down"" on them.  So yes, the power dynamic has been flipped in this respect for about 40 years."
2021-09-21 15:06:21,"As usual, Douthat strains at a gnat and swallows a camel.

He finds one supposedly ""left-wing"" book review in a British publication, in which the author closes with a somewhat romantic tribute to the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of dystopian conditions, and builds out of it an entire construct in his own imagination in which ""the left"" has one set of ideas about government response to civil emergencies and ""the right"" has another.

Then when the facts of the specific American response to COVID-19---in an election year with a demagogic lunatic in the White House who had brought an entire political party into his Orwellian cult of personality---don't fit that template, rather than look for the real-world reasons for this outcome, Douthat manufactures some kind of cosmic intellectual flip. 

Ross Douthat, whose scorn for pointy-headed intellectual elites is part of his brand, needs to spend less time thinking about Michel Foucault and the supposed theological trends of contemporary thought, and a bit more time looking at the actual words and deeds of politicians, TV talking heads, and ordinary people.  Their motivations tend to be more immediate, more self-serving, and more concrete (""follow the money,"" just for starters) than the forces that attract so much of Douthat's attention."
2021-09-21 15:23:56,"If you look at the response to the pandemic as parallel to the acceptance of science, there's no flip-flop--liberals seem to believe in science, and lots of ""conservatives"" don't (sorry for the quotation marks, but I'm not sure sure fans of Trump are very conservative). When the science-believing among us listen to and try to heed the advice of Dr. Fauci and his colleagues, is that a surprise?"

Thanks. But casting this or that item into increasingly personal and solipsistic jabs at the ""left"" and nods to the ""right"" become distractingly off-point. One is left wondering, for instance, why the ""left"" adhering to expert scientific information is lit as an inconstancy. Take away this silly casting into shapeless and broken molds, and you have done quite good work. Let me say. Good work. You are not ""conservative."" You are not ""liberal."" You simply are. Run with it."

""Major setback"" - Douthat was right again!  Not.

Note to internet doctors.  Stop playing virologist.  Get vested with Fauci's expertise.

Get Vaccinated!!!  

That is all Douthat need write (and he cannot read trend lines)."
2021-09-21 15:27:54,"Frustrating that readers can’t acknowledge the facts here. Don’t usually agree with Douthat, but like he said, the “flip” is weird, and it has happened. He isn’t arguing why this happened or who is right."
2021-09-21 15:28:31,"I have been a ""Covid hawk"", as Mr. Douthat puts it, since the beginning, and haven't done any flip-flops.  I'm also a climate change hawk, for that matter. But I have had little patience for pseudoscience, and the flip-flops that Mr. Douthat finds in both the right and the left have corresponded roughly to each side finding convenient pseudosciences for themselves.

First the left convinced itself that quarantines didn't work and were racist. Then the right convinced itself that the disease wasn't very infectious or virulent. On and on.  Each side ranted against masks when they were into doing something that didn't accommodate masks.  And each side convinced itself they were following the science.

Epidemiologists studied some of the rebellion against mitigation methods before -- in the 2007 flu epidemic, it was found that young people would fail to follow social distancing and mask mitigations and needed to be dealt with separately in statistical models about compliance.

But I've also seen this with climate change, with people convincing themselves they are doing enough if they go vegan so they can drive that gas guzzler, etc.

When it comes right down to it, facing a crisis to all of society requires discipline, and both sides have shown a painful lack of such, together with elaborate arguments for why they are actually doing the right thing, much of the time.

Discipline isn't about authoritarianism or libertarianism. It's about self-control, and self-honesty."
2021-09-21 15:29:01,"I was born into mid-century America. Best I can tell, some sort of Puritanism swept much of the world between about 25-75 years before I was born. It seems to have been very bad for men and much worse for women than it was for men. It always seemed reasonable to largely associate that wave of Puritanism with religion and with the political right.

Less than 30 years after I was born came Reagan and Reaganism. They were clearly right wing. In the wake of the civil rights era they promoted racial divisiveness in order to win elections. And they preached that government was the problem, even though we have representative self-government and vote for our representatives, even as they preached that we needed to go all in on the military industrial complex (not the way they phrased it).

I think you can draw a straight line from the Reaganite idea that government is the problem to the extreme libertarianism that verges on anarchy on the political right today. The Republican approach to the 2004 election seems to sum all that up and bring all that together for me: demonize gay marriage while going all in for a war of choice in Iraq while also going all in for tax cuts in a war we needed to pay for.

And here we are. I think the Reaganites intended “government is the problem” to apply more narrowly to economic matters. But turns out their base, under the influence of political infotainment entrepreneurs, eventually took them broadly and literally."
2021-09-21 15:33:56,"This study in weirdness doesn't even consider Trump: as president he correctly (like the occasionally correct stopped clock) put a lot of resources into vaccine development, thinking it would help improve his sorry reelection prospects.  After surviving severe covid (with the help of not widely available treatments) and losing the presidency, he was subsequently booed at a MAGA rally for suggesting people ought to get vaccinated."
2021-09-21 15:35:32,"Maybe it is my background as an RN who worked in a hospital during the AID's crisis.  Maybe it is the act that when I was very young there were no vaccines other than small pox.  My generation endured measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, and feared polio until the vaccine when I was already 9 years old.  Maybe it is the fact that when my daughters were in school, the state of CA mandated that public and private elementary and high school students be up-to-date in their vaccinations.  Or maybe it is just morality and a sense of responsibility toward my own and others that allows me to assert that medical science comes before politics.  Only the proud, the arrogant, the egotistical, and willfully ignorant choose the opposite."
2021-09-21 15:30:11,"This comment is a perfect example of the disingenuous ""thoughtfulness"" of right-wing commentary. ""Oh, maybe the left just hates Trump so much that they choose their position just because it's opposite his! Maybe the left is feeling their oats, those jerks!""

Nowhere do I see any engagement with the actual position of the left, which has been consistent for at least the past five to ten years, which is a focus on lifting up, supporting and protecting the most vulnerable people in our communities. While the right has characterized this intention as being ""snowflakes,"" the left has continuously shrugged off this misnomer with the nonchalance of people who know they're doing the difficult work.

The support of COVID restrictions follows this work perfectly. The desire to follow CDC guidelines, including instating temporary protocols to fight the virus, intend to protect those who will become very sick, those who can't get vaccinated yet, those who are working on the front lines.

It's not political. While the right-wing commentators insist on making it a political issue in keeping with their wild-eyed fanaticism over identity politics, the left will continue to forge on with the difficult work."
2021-09-21 15:29:36,"Wow, that’s a lot of extrapolating about “liberals” from just one book review (Ross didn’t even seem to read the actual book).

My suggested explanation about the Republican/right wing/authoritarian response to the pandemic (which has been a disaster in many countries like Brazil,India,Russia and Republican led areas of the USA) is that these ideologies are fundamentally selfish. As such they are wholly incapable of addressing any serious problem that requires collective and unified action to address it.
 I believe Republicans realized fairly early on that to properly confront covid would undermine/destroy their selfish governing ideology and that consequently they wanted no part in dealing with it. All the fake Republican arguments about “personal choice” and “freedom” are just a distraction to keep their base from confronting how horrifically Republicans have performed during the pandemic."
2021-09-21 15:14:44,"Ross, it's a lot less complicated than you make it. Democrats are, and have been for a long time, a pro-science, pro-intellectualism party. All the institutions of higher education are bastions of coercive liberalism, remember?

Conversely, the Republican party, led by its base, has been racing toward the bottom of an anti-science, anti-intellectualism and anti-government movement. The base is being cheered on by the Republican elites. Policies to curb man-made global warming? It's bad for profits - deny it. Policies that grant equal rights and justice for all human beings? Not so fast - we can win elections on this prejudice. Policies to aggressively address this once-in-a-century public health crisis? It's bad for quarterly profits and could cost our guy the election.

Republicans have built a brand and a power structure based on this distrust of science, intellectualism and government. Keep the Democrats out of it. There's been no flip flop. The Republicans are now the party of ""dumb"" and all these unnecessary antivaxxer deaths are just the latest, starkest example."
2021-09-21 15:15:39,"One of our fairly close friends, despite having been a nurse long ago, did not believe that that the big red target on her abdomen was the bite of a Lyme-carrying tick.  Rather, like Ross’ manipulated theory, she insisted it was a spider bite.  In a while, it took her mind. Spent her last eight years raving in a nursing home. 
No, not that Ross’ faculties have been altered by a spirochete, even if Long Lyme might manifest that way, but makes me wonder what addled the brains of all those hate-inflamed people on the misnamed ‘right’ side of politics.  Just please don’t call them doves."
2021-09-21 15:38:45,"To me, the oddity is in the shifts among specific people I know. Those who would have mocked the anti-vaxxers in years past who are now militantly anti-vax (though they'll tell you that they're ""pro-freedom,"" that position is obvious cover for fear and political bias). Or those who would have been, let's say, vaccine skeptical in the past who now suddenly ""trust the science"" and can't acknowledge that some individuals might actually be afraid of a relatively untested vaccine. 

And then, the further oddity of those who are now anti-vax, who tend to fall in the ""personal responsibility"" camp, pushing the view that they shouldn't have to bear the consequences of their choice when in public, despite the clear evidence in the case data. But then also the position of pro-mask/restriction folks refusing to acknowledge that those who are getting severely sick are far more likely to be unvaccinated and older and that for the vaccinated and young, life is now full of more pressing risks than Covid. Again, in my experience, these individuals tend to be in the ""do what you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone"" camp, but in many situations they refuse to consider that some actions have non-obvious, long-term consequences that society would do well to discourage."

Imagine if it were reversed, the right wing was pro vaccines and the left againstt them, as i suppose he believes fits with the difference between authoritarianism of the right and liberal traditions of the left, rather than doing the wrong thing for the right wing because a liberal leaning authority, the new Democratic led government , says you should and the right thing to protect themselves and their friends and family, of the left, then I think the conservatives would say -- if they are unvaccinated and you need a hospital bed for someone who is vaccinated, then take out the tubes and use the help for the person who did the right thing -- rather than say -- the unvaccinated, despite their stupidity, need to be cared for which is now the rule.  It will be interesting to see if out of all the people who die if the share of Republicans is higher than the share of Democrats now that there is a vaccine that works.  If not for health reasons to get vaccinated, then maybe for protecting your political advantage in close elections."

2021-09-21 15:21:42,"To frame Covid masking and vaccine mandates as some kind of lefty assertion of power is ridiculous. It is public heath against conspiracy and Trumper know-nothing-ism. Yes, there may be times when the public health advocates go too far, but it isn't as an assertion of power or some latent authoritarianism, it is an attempt to craft public policy to save lives. And I for one believe school lockdowns were an absolutely sensible strategy.

Nearly 700k Americans have died from Covid. Why does that not seem to matter?  

And how is it that a religious advocate like Ross is ok with loosening restrictions at the expensive of a few lives? That sounds  distinctly utilitarian, which is very odd coming from a Catholic."
2021-09-21 15:16:59,"Ross' report of his armchair evolution is fascinating, but as he's neither a public official nor an authority on public health, one has to ask:  what's that got to do with anything?

Covid should have no politics.  Those entrusted with responsibility and presumed knowledge will still make errors, but here's hoping such missteps won't reflect Ross' ideological preferences or the London Review of Books.

Perhaps one to place to start is keeping epidemiology off the opinion pages?  Bret Stephens and this columnist do not have admirable histories here.

How's that?"
2021-09-21 15:39:47,"No plague is a left-right political thing. Covid is a virus and it doesn't take sides. From its onset the remedy has always been about the science, research, experimentation and implementation, re-evaluation. I really don't care about your personal conundrum Ross as it exhibits the elite status that you enjoy. The science has not targeted any special group other than the elderly as dictated by the virus not politics. Most of us just want to stay healthy, keep our families and friends safe and look to the light at the end of the tunnel. Right now the science says mask up and get fully vaccinated, just what is so complicated about that for either those on the left or those on the right or those in between. Politics has absolutely nothing to do with it so stop feeding the dragon."

He must be a very principled man. But American politics are a patchwork of otherwise conflicting interests and allegiances. I'm not quite cynical enough yet to say the major political parties simply fall in line with the highest bidder, but I'm getting there. COVID hasn't changed anything about our politics. It's simply big enough to expose what we've become."

When you still drink beers with folks from both sides an article like this is enlightening. I am vaccinated but not angered by having to wear a mask. But, like lung cancer deaths from smoking and early deaths from fast living, I am more saddened and still gutted by COVID deaths as it feels as though folk's communities have failed them. Douthat understands that this community is all encompassing, and weirdly fluid- not simply two halves with two different flavors of righteousness."
2021-09-21 10:21:17,"Mr. Douthat, 

I've been wondering what the proportions of the unvaccinated
are religious. Additionally, how many of 'the former guy's' supporters claim to be Christian and won't get vaccinated.

From my vaccinated, atheist perspective, it seems the majority of vaccine naysayers and 'the former guy's' supporters claim not only to be Christian but believe 'the former guy' is ordained by some old white guy with grey hair and beard looking down upon us from the sky. 

But, then again, I am aware of my own biases, and have been too busy trying to do my job in this pandemic to do the research on my own.

Face it, your conservative flock is no longer conservative but renegade mavericks with frightening measures of Kook-Aid flavored by insurrection and anti-democracy."

Essayists and reviewers get paid for their cleverness and a little contrarianism goes a long way to paying the mortgage.  After witnessing refrigerator trucks outside New York City hospitals, thoughtful people of all ideologies should have altered their long-held ""principles"" to pull together to minimize the carnage.   Liberals need to acknowledge that Donald Trump's travel ban was correct and that Operation Warp Speed was a triumph. Conservatives need to acknowledge that we have to act together to solve a dire emergency. even if we have to temporarily sacrifice some of our freedoms."
2021-09-21 12:38:02,"Yes, Ross, let us acknowledge that everything in this life breaks down to liberal and conservative ideologies that you alone know and understand!

What Ross is incapable of seeing or understanding is that everything in this life doesn't break down to his neat little definitions of right and left.  By continuing to pursue his immature view of the world we never need to grow and mature into anything more than what we are and what we have been.  By definition Conservatives want to keep us as we are - children easily controllable with tried and true methods that keep us in their line.  Ross wants to keep us this way so that he can maintain his belief in himself and this world where his juvenile piety makes him feel superior and righteous.

This isn't about left and right - it is about control.  I simply don't want my neighbor's actions to cause the death of my child.  Whatever is the best way to achieve that end, I am for.  Your freedom to behave as you like means nothing to me if your freedom kills my child.  And the opposite is true.  In a healthy society all of us would understand that we are all connected and hold the life of each other in our hands.  In a time of pandemic it is our duty as members of the society to do everything in our ability to keep each other safe.  By turning this into a right and left struggle we perverted the very basis of our connection and showed the sickness of our society.  If Ross was a true Christian he would understand this."

2021-09-21 15:45:51,"What?
I just have to admit that this essay is completely confusing to me.

Are you saying that liberals didn't listen to and respect health professionals and scientists ... didn't want public policy to follow the science ... until covid?
I am liberal and that is not my experience or understanding.

Here's what I know for sure:
Since the availability of vaccines, all my liberal friends and family have been vaccinated. Two had very mild breakthrough cases.
Since the availability of vaccines, my conservative family members remain unvaccinated BECAUSE OF POLITICS. The information they are getting is from right-wing sources, so they are NOT getting the same information as I am.  As of today, at least 8 conservative family members have contracted covid. Probably more. Since they know I'm frustrated by their making health decisions from a trough of lies, they don't always tell me the bad news. As of today, one of my conservative family members is dead. In my opinion, he died because of conservative politics and the lies therein.

So, Mr. Douthat, I don't really understand all your references and I was unable to follow your logic. By the end I was just irritated. 

But, I know for sure what my personal experience has been for the past 17 months and I know for sure that all my liberal friends and family are vaccinated and are not sick. Most of my conservative family are unvaccinated, they are getting sick and they are dying. 

Pretty simple. No need to complicate it."
2021-09-21 15:48:01,"Another more recent observation. Anti-vax conservatives are getting free antibody treatment at the expense of tax payers at a cost of $2,000 per treatment, compared to $20 for vaccination. I doubt you will hear conservative complaining about that social welfare. Personally, I think unvaccinated should pay for their own antibody therapy. I also think it was absurd for the government to give out thousands of dollars in COVID relief to people who remained employed and were already seeing their saving increase due to restrictions on travel, eating out, and shopping. Mistakes were made, mistakes will be made, such is life."

2021-09-21 11:44:52,"Describing masses of people as, ""the left"" and ""the right"" and then ascribing them universally similar ideas, is simplistic and merely a rhetorical maneuver.

2021-09-21 15:49:23,"""Maybe the key is the absolute power of partisanship and polarization, in which once Donald Trump chose Covid-minimizing rhetoric, everybody else just rushed into their places.""

I think this is correct. If there was a widespread perception that ""the right"" was in control of positions of government bureaucracy, I suspect the political faultlines would have broken in opposite directions on this issue. The right would be comparing lockdowns to great national efforts like World War II which required shared sacrifice; the left would be talking about class inequality and rightwing scolds limiting their personal freedom. The libertarians would be invoking the Harm Principle and saying that lockdowns were justified because the state can restrict personal liberty in order to protect non-consenting third parties from harm. 

Like most of politics, it's not about what the government does, it's about who's giving the order."

I just want people to get vaccinated rather than believing that God will protect them.  I want to be protected from these anti-vaxxers, and right now, I am not.

You write as if this is some permanent state of being (or thinking). There are levels of gray to the thinking on both sides of this, although essentially on the left the root cause is protecting ourselves and others, a willingness to sacrifice for the moment for good of society.

Well, they largely did go away last spring, especially in red states, regardless of local vaccination rates. And that's why we have gone through the summer's wave of unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths from delta. Unmasking would only make sense if in fact vaccination was widespread. MO, TX, and FL show what happens when politicians cynically advocate against masking AND vaccination. For the most part Dem governors have done a better job of protecting their citizens, even if a few Dems foolishly flout their own rules in public; do as they say, not as they do! It is telling that RD has to invoke the review of a book about a 17th century plague in Italy to come up with an example of left wing flouting of public health guidelines. I agree it is time for him to put this topic aside for now."
2021-09-21 15:56:30,"Ross I agree we shouldn’t have to wear masks IF vaccinations were widespread.  I don’t think you got the memo from your conservative, libertarian, Republican or just oppositional defiant disordered friends/colleagues who claim it is their right to not be vaccinated.  It is not their right to put those of us who have been responsible, societally oriented individuals at risk and to delay the recovery of the economy.  Frankly, my mother always told me someone has to be the adult and behave appropriately.  I am tired of being the adult and letting others act as toddlers having a tantrum.  Don’t get vaccinated (assuming eligible) or wear a mask and when (not if) that individual becomes ill they should have to pay for ALL of their medical care. If a vaccinated person comes into the hospital needing care and there are no beds, the unvaccinated are moved out."

2021-09-21 16:00:03,"As a left-leaning academic, apologies, but I don't find the way this all has played out particularly strange.  One of the chief break-points in our contemporary dialogue about social values concerns the competing values of individualism and the common good, and that break has never been clean.  On the left, historically we've seen a close adherence to a strong individualism on issues like cultural mores and sexual behavior, but a focus on the common good and issues of systemic justice where economic and political institutions writ large are concerned.  And the pattern is typically reversed on the right.  I agree that Trump's (unforgiveable, woeful) stand on COVID immediately polarized reactions, but in many respects it was just another version of (in this case, extreme) individualist values asserted in the face of compelling arguments drawing on the common good.  And even where those on the left made an exception for events like racial justice marches, those exceptions were also justified in terms of the pursuit of the common good; it was *that* important that people signal clearly how unacceptable and intolerable events like the racially-motivated murder of George Floyd are."

2021-09-21 16:01:24,"I think Douthat's analysis is remarkably off the mark and he misses simpler ""causes"" for the position of the left and right on the COVID-19 response (which as other commenters have noted is nowhere as unified or homogeneous as the author implies).  The Left generally believes that government provides beneficial services for the common good and fighting a clear public health emergency where individual behavior can have significant social impacts (getting vaccinated; wearing a mask; social distancing; quaranting or isolating (negative externalties to economists) clearly meets that test and thus supports the regime being implemented (reluctantly by Trump; aggessively by Biden).  The right is distrustful of government, more skeptical of science esp from academics, and values liberty often above social obligations.  Add in the identify politics of the Rep Party - Trump should be touring RED states touting and claiming credit for HIS vaccine - and the story we are seeing is both obvious and consistent.  Ross has overthought by a wide margin."
2021-09-21 16:00:09,"Do not confuse the left with health fanatics, primarily on the West Coast, who doubt medicines and doctors because they grew up on stories (including rumors) about the evils of capitalists profiteering in medicines and agriculture and now live in revolt."
2021-09-21 15:53:16,"What a nice way to commemorate the fact that 670,000 people have died from a virus-to view it as a 'weird political view' and that we should just ignore the future counts as being those of 'just those weird little deaths' that don't mean anything. World wide, it's killed 4 million.

The Black Plague, over the centuries, killed 70-200 million people world wide during its' reign. The fact that one town survived during the 17th century has absolutely no relevance to this virus or time.

Politics has made this virus and pandemic 10 times worse than it should have been. 

Maybe fewer of these 'learned positions' of political columnists should be mandated. It certainly would lower the temperature in the room."
2021-09-21 16:00:28,"That was quite a verbal maze. What's 'weird' is how those in the right field bleachers have bought into bizarre conspiracies and identify with the twice impeached ex-president. 25% of Americans refuse to be vaccinated under any circumstances, and that sure isn't the Democrats.

Right wing media amplifies the lies and misinformation. I've being seeing reports about those who believe all the stuff from pundits like Tucker Carlson casting shade on vaccines. 

Then that person dies and relents on their deathbed, but it's too late. The family is hopping mad and blaming Faux news or social media. Freedom isn't free, it requires responsibility."
2021-09-21 15:48:21,"Stringent public health measures are not inherently authoritarian, they are the logical extension of”loving your neighbor like oneself”."
2021-09-21 16:00:47,"Not as complex as you conflate, Ross. 
The left leaders, elite uber-educated technocrats, still trust science.  The right leaders, educated-promoting belief and conspiracy (whether they believe it or not) and undereducated believing the conspiracies over facts, because they want to believe that those technocrats don't know them. 
But COVID knows them."
2021-09-21 15:55:13,"Who cares what a review in the LRB said? The facts are that Democrats have mostly favored public health efforts backed by experts and the right has rallied around conspiracy theories and childish ideas of ""freedom.""
Confused conservatives like Douthat can blame this all on ""partisanship"" but the fact is that his side of politics has chosen to let hundreds of thousands of people die unnecessarily."
2021-09-21 16:08:11,"What ""flip-flop""? It seems arguable that the ""left"" can work toward two ends at once: using public health mandates to minimize harm while also addressing the societal inequities exacerbated by those mandates. The political left has made both of these its priorities in the pandemic era. Yes, the sacrifices that come with public health measures are many and wide-ranging but the underlying belief remains as follows: the harm is still outweighed by the lives saved."
2021-09-21 16:11:28,"Even more now, I encourage Ross to examine positions on the theme: “Religious exemptions for vaccinations and other public health measures.” In view of the fact that no major religion has proscribed vaccinations, can The Church of My Opinion instruct its (single) member to not be vaccinated? My position would be that public health, especially that of dangerous diseases, is like the rest of government: religion should play no part."
2021-09-21 16:11:29,"Another predictable attempt by Douthat to create imaginary equivalency in the left and the right.

The left has supported pro-science health measures for decades while the right has continuously attacked them. This includes all forms of health care: from vaccinations, to women's right to choose, to affordable medical insurance, to managing drug costs, to end of life options.

The right still has no meaningful agenda other than opposing the left. The only relatively moral high ground the right occupies is in being anti-abortion, but one can disagree with that on moral principles as well.

Other than that the only principle the right has is favoring higher healthcare costs for everyone in every scenario, thus benefitting their corporate donors. The donors who then send some of the obscene profits back to the politicians of the right."
2021-09-21 16:11:30,"Deep analysis won't explain why people in Alaska and Idaho let the pandemic reach an intensity where hospitals were overwhelmed and sick people are sitting in parking lots or being transported to other states.

Only 2 - 3% of the population is dying so individuals really don't have to worry, right? Surviving severe illness of or experiencing long Covid can be a nightmare, but that isn't prominent in the media message.

If one's primary goal is ""owning the libs"" that is most important right up to the point that mom dies. And maybe it stays most important. The ""libs"" don't feel emotionally compelled to own the GQP and so a larger fraction get vaccinated, but not enough.

If death rates reached 30% or more, I'm still not sure whether protection from death or owning the libs would win."
2021-09-21 16:12:37,"i think the flipped stance of left and right to the pandemic is actually not such a puzzle. it is an extension of deep and longstanding value differences between liberals and conservatives: liberals valuing social responsibility and caring for the needy vs. conservatives valuing policies promoting individual freedoms to make money, spend, etc. and for the poor pull-yourself-up by the bootstraps. so in the pandemic, liberals naturally support making personal sacrifices with masking etc in the interests of the whole society. conservatives, on the other hand, are focused on the personal needs and interests of the individual."
2021-09-21 16:15:07,"There are facts the are trumped by fear. Many studies, available at the CDC, say the asymptomatic cases are twice as many as confirmed cases, the US total is more like 120 million cases. If not, masks which are meant to stop the spread from people who were unaware of their condition, would make no sense or justification. Second, recovered people have equivalent immunity to vaccines, again proven with scientific investigation. Lastly,  children don't need vaccination because their response to infection is superior to breakthrough cases of vaccinated adults."
2021-09-21 16:17:08,"There is nothing more to say, but this: COVID is the only real enemy and is making fools of us all."
2021-09-21 16:16:07,"I wear a mask with the words:

I AM VIRTUE SIGNALING

Never fails to annoy the anti-science Republicans."
2021-09-21 16:19:06,"I am very puzzled by this column. I am a nurse, and favor public health measures like wearing masks, frquent covid rapid tests, and vaccination. I am appalled by southern states that refuse vaccination, or mask wearing, and governors that urge their constituents to die."
2021-09-21 16:05:05,"You know how the left always likes to be modern and forward thinking, and the right is just plain old fashioned. Maybe that’s what kicked in."
2021-09-21 16:19:30,"As of yesterday only 55% of Americans are fully vaccinated. Apparently most of the remaining 45% have some kind of politically induced right wing death wish. A death wish that impacts the health of everyone, not to mention the economy.

And here is Mr. Douthat cooking up some bizarre idea that the left - that is, the people who have largely tried to follow fact and science and are now enormously frustrated by those who threaten everyone's wellbeing - is at fault for trying to do something about it; that a group trying to preserve health and homes is as much at fault for polarization as those who want to destroy it. I'm just amazed at the sheer absurdity of this. I'm left wondering why someone not on Fox News would write it in the first place.

Good choice to stop writing about it."
2021-09-21 16:21:03,"I'm at a loss as to the toxic mess of vaccination politics. I would wager that over 90&% of people who are resistant to taking any form of Covid vaccine have already received several in their lifetimes, including: Measles, Polio, TB, Mumps, Chicken Pox, and the list goes on. And the science is pretty clear on the results, as the infection rates on all of the above have pretty much eradicated these diseases. That is, until people started referring to Tucker Carlson for expert medical advise."
2021-09-21 16:16:20,Way too much analysis here.  Not weird or complicated at all.  The right wing is armed to the teeth and looking for a fight.  Any fight.
2021-09-21 16:04:38,"Overthinking it.  The right is trained to believe the left/democrats are the enemy, so they oppose anything they want. 

If there was a terror attack tomorrow, the right would find fault with democrats, even if it was a right wing extremists. If democrats wanted a Reagan style cut taxes, the right would find cause to oppose it."
2021-09-21 16:10:24,"Democrats tend to embrace education, science, expertise.  Democrats, in general, want government to consult with experienced, well-trained, knowledgeable members of our society so that it can act rationally to protect us all.  The GOP, at this point in our history, has been commandeered by an American Taliban that has declared war on most of its fellow Americans — including, among others, the best trained among us in journalism, climatology, the social sciences, epidemiology, history, etc. etc.  Whether it's polio vaccines or education for girls, the Taliban has to oppose it because a sensible, rational approach to life is inimical to the prejudices that the Taliban hold dear."
2021-09-21 16:27:51,"Mr. Douthat assumes that people settle first in a certain worldview, assume the ideas derived from it, and then look around to associate with those that share that worldview and those ideas, and hence political parties are born...

Unfortunately, since the time of our primate ancestors, the dynamic has been the opposite: people look for others they can easily identify as similar to them (same race, same idiom, same way of clothing) and then adjust their worldview and beliefs accordingly.

What for? to better fight against those holding different views that, by definition, he will just as esasily be able to identify as different to themselves. As Kurt Vonnegut used to say, ""and so it goes""."
2021-09-21 16:28:11,"The point of closure was to gain time for creation of a vaccine, and to prevent health care from being overwhelmed by numbers of cases until then.

We have the vaccine. We expanded the health care.

So now? We have not moved on to the Step Two we intended. We are not using the vaccine to its fullest. We did not fully expand heath care, and now are shrinking it back again while the Pandemic continues.

This is incompetent."
2021-09-21 16:27:57,"The only thing weird about COVID politics is that it is surely the first time that one party has deliberately encouraged mass death as a means of damaging the other and regaining power.  MAGAs are willing to kill themselves literally in order to kill the Democrats politically, gambling that the electorate will blame  Biden for the damage to people and the economy."
2021-09-21 16:20:42,The only thing weird is that almost the entire world has behaved like they never heard of germ theory.
2021-09-21 16:29:46,"""I’m equally fascinated by how dramatically liberals have swung against any acknowledgment of what until very recently seemed like a core left perspective — that stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian and inevitably ratify various forms of inequality and social control.""

Really? I find this premise deeply flawed. Stringent public health responses are a) not inherently authoritarian (although of course whomever is imposing them can choose to make them so), b) perfectly consistent with progressive thinking, and c) things which can help address social inequality.

Social medicine, workplace heath and safety, fluoride in water, publicly maintained sanitation ...  As far as I know, none of these were championed by the right."
2021-09-21 16:36:25,"Excellent article as usual Ross.

But worrying about 'human thriving' at this point reminds my of my kid's usual random objections to some time-sensitive,  essential task that we're doing - my response is always a variation of, ""We're just trying to get this done."""
2021-09-21 16:37:00,"The focus is one aspect of this absurd situation. Totalitarian vs. ""freedom"" is a part of this entire situation. What is missing is the basic fact that the anti-vaxers and anti-health protocols are part of the far right, anti-reality segment of the population. As former president W Bush said in essence, we have no need of facts. We create our own reality.

This, I think, is the core problem. A large segment of the population have abandoned reason in favor of political ideology. This is evidenced in that it seems most anti-vaxers are also against attempts to address climate change, are jumping on the anti Roe v. Wade bandwagon and are opposed to the role of reason in favor of political opposition in every day reality.

Certainly these attitudes were glorified and promoted Trump and his cabal and are now bearing fruit in increasing case loads of covid stressing the entire medical care system of the US. The attitudes actually have people rejecting actual fact based medicine in favor of advice and direction from talk radio and extreme right wing religious factions to the point that medicines for cattle and horses are now preferred over sound medical treatment. This is indeed the creation of a reality that is not real and not based on fact."
2021-09-21 16:38:37,"Pick your angle, see what you see.  Somehow this hot take ignores that the right has become vehemently anti-science.  There are anti-science forces on the left too, particularly the academic left, but they aren't nearly as ascendant as on the right.  They do probably include Douthat's LRB writer, so quick to dismiss public health measures that worked and speculate that instead somehow a virus changed its degree of virulence in one city out of many.  And the libertarian trend in US conservative politics is not new.  Nor is it new that US liberals see a large role for the state in daily life and don't view that as a threat to freedom.  Or to put it differently, the academic left's love affair with Foucault never managed to break through into mainstream Democratic politics or policy, the fact that the pandemic didn't change that is hardly shocking."
2021-09-21 16:40:44,"It is the blatant disregard of the laws and mandates which appears to flip-flop amount political philosophies.  Mask mandates are more like mask recommendations.  We all see the lack of enforcement on public transportation.  We read about confrontations on planes, and now in restaurants, but not of the perpetuators being tried, and if found guilty, sentence to prison and stiff terms.

Our society has become less law abiding.  We can, and should, argue on the need for mandates and other rules, but not have the right to selectively choose which ones we, as individuals, will comply with, especially when the issues impact society as a whole."
2021-09-21 16:41:56,"All I know is that the people that complain the most about how inconvenient the pandemic is are the very ones that keep it from leaving.   And sorry, getting vaccinated for a communicable disease isn't a private decision.   Covid-19's best friends are all Republican governors."
2021-09-21 16:44:07,"I am amazed that there is no mention of economics in this. Small-business owners are opinion-makers in every town, tend to be conservative, and have suffered disproportionately during shutdowns as they watch their little baby businesses die a slow death without much help from the government. Meanwhile, the work-from-home crowd, and the teachers and government workers, who skew liberal, have been collecting their paychecks and watching Netflix. The working class, meanwhile, is bombarded with conflicting messages from both sides. If this seems like a difficult circle to square, you're right, it is."
2021-09-21 16:48:43,"I think you're letting one or two left-leaning academics speak too much for the entire center-left spectrum, here. In fact, I think that's a really big problem with the perception of the left in general. We are not our academics. 

When you point out who speaks for the right, you wisely start with Donald Trump and work your way down. This works because the right is basically Donald Trump's cult at this point. He is their leader and most prominent member. To contrast him with some academic nobody's even heard of is pulling a strawman out of thin air. No offense to the academic, I guess."
2021-09-21 16:49:22,"Because the “right wing” was in power when the pandemic started, they were afforded the opportunity to set the official national narrative.  They chose the path of minimization and denial and set the tone for the polarization we are still dealing with today, despite overwhelming scientific evidence.

If the right wing had chosen an authoritarian approach of a “hawkish” nature (to use Douthat’s characterization), we would be living in a very different America today.  The “doves” chose the gamble of short-run economic gain, hoping for a quick way out when they should have realized, based on the evidence, that the smartest long-run approach would have been aggressive action.

It seems ever this way with the “right wing” approach.  They want their cut up front and somebody else can pay the piper later.  Avarice and short term thinking are the defining characteristics of the modern American right wing."
2021-09-21 16:49:35,"Ross really has to bend over backwards in order to find some rhetorical basis for blaming current polarizations on 'the left'.  The Republicans almost everywhere kowtow the most divisive and militant segment of their constituency.  The Democrats for the most part don't do that.  Even if we narrow it down to the public health issues that the writer is focusing on, where does this leave us?  What will the right, or libertarians, do when policies and budgets having to do with other health issues come up?  Progress that was made, and trumpeted, in areas as clean water and childhood inoculations during the 20th century are now in jeopardy.  Libertarians have never spoken up, except in opposition, when it comes to public support for the community good."
2021-09-21 16:51:44,"This opinion raises a real area where the left and right generally differ -- the obligation of the country/society to protect the vulnerable.  Especially visible  in debates on healthcare and welfare, this has equally infected the Covid debate.

Conservatives often say I am not at much risk, why should I [wear a mask, get vaccinated, etc.]  Early in the pandemic, many were downplaying the virus because it was killing mainly old folks.  That was to me an astonishing position, reflecting the growing focus of conservatives (and some liberals) on me.  

That same lack of concern for others runs through the current response to vaccination/masks.  I would love to have the proverbial nickel for every time I have heard a statement to the effect of -- if you want protection, take the vaccine, its not my job to help you stay well.  As a liberal, I disagree.  Even apart from my own protection, it ismy moral obligation to help protect others, some of whom may not be in a position to help themselves.  The whole idea of community immunity is to help protect the vulnerable -- those who cannot be vaccinated from a medical perspective, and those (such as me) for whom the vaccine may not be effective.  

Polio never killed more than 3,000 Americans per year, yet getting vaccinated was deemed patriotic. In January 2021, Covid killed more than 3,00 per day, on average.  Yet resisting vaccination is argued to be the patriotic position, with concern only about individual health."
2021-09-21 16:53:06,"Hyper-partisanship can explain blues becoming more right wing with some authoritarian measures.
Consider the death rates currently with the vastly lower rates when Trump issued the lock-down's guidelines in March 2020. Yet, now with control of the House, Senate and White House, they have not issued a lock-down now, although that would help flatten the curve. If their objective is to have the least deaths in America, that might explain their support of mask or vaccine mandates, but would conflict with their lack of support for another lock-down.
The explanation of the seeming inconsistency is that another lock-down would be unpopular, while supporting mandates is a way to blame reds for the pandemic. In comparing Trump with Xi Jinping or Biden with Xi Jinping, both U.S. presidents have failed, the federal government has had, and is having, a catastrophic failure. Blaming reds shifts the blame in blue's minds, thus they can still believe that ""government didn't fail,"" reds did, and that that can be fixed by voting blue."
2021-09-21 16:53:27,"The primary sin of government in the entire COVID fiasco was the inability of authorities to convey the explicit tradeoffs necessary for social welfare. Everything arrived by diktat; nothing was offered as a set of systemic tradeoffs because the opposing positions became political rather than pragmatic. Why didn't governments tie vaccination rates or masking compliance rates to policy-level decisions? They could have created social pressures to resolve problematic pandemic behaviors, but instead foolishly set themselves up as targets of anti-authoritarian vigilantes by issuing all orders via decree, enforced explicitly by state power.

Remember that early essay ""The Hammer and the Dance""? It wasn't about having positions being all hammer or all dancing, but about the careful balancing act of maintaining communal order through a communally spread pandemic. Because these positions became political, however, those seem to be the two extremes the nation has bifurcated into, based solely upon the political leanings of local governments."
2021-09-21 16:53:30,"The left only wants everyone to be vaccinated; everyone for whom the vaccine by its very nature would not be, itself, a threat to the health of the individual. Over 99% of people could take the vaccine under these circumstances, and the pandemic would end. It's not a giant issue of authoritarianism. Mr. Douthat as most other right wing commentators is making political an argument that one of simple health decision-making."
2021-09-21 16:56:52,"I respect today's scientists, and, within reason, I trust their advice about how to cope with a novel pandemic.  I do not trust either the scientific knowledge or the commitment to equity of 17th century Florentines.  Both may make mistakes, but I think we've learned a significant amount about disease and about humanity in the last few hundred years.  Also, the risks of an ongoing pandemic feel more immediate to me than one whose victims and survivors are all centuries dead.

Mr. Douthat, does this help you understand why I might react differently to these scenarios?"
2021-09-21 16:57:01,It's not left vs. right.  It's about scientific literacy.  It's about understanding who should be considered the authority when questions of science are addressed.
2021-09-21 17:06:56,"Good lord, where to start with this column? As with so much of Douthat's writing, he starts from an interesting place I can get on board with, but then it quickly devolves into a world that I just can't recognize. 

The left hasn't ""flipped"" when it comes to medical intervention. The left has a long history of fighting for equality, believing in science, and putting in safety standards that benefit workers and the general populace. When the left is skeptical of governmental overreach regarding science, it's when science has been used inappropriately against people, particularly minority groups."
2021-09-21 17:07:38,"There were all sorts of sea changes in terms of people's politics over the last two years. I don't know if left and right really apply much anymore (someone should do an investigation into where these terms come from). 

For instance, my essential worker friend, raised in a union family and strongly what you might consider of the left, began questioning liberal orthodoxy. He had to work in a warehouse even without masks at the beginning. So I think he was scarred because he was scared. Same with my police officer friend, who also mostly works outside where virus transmission is rare, which probably reinforced his sense that restrictions were overblown, even when in my opinion they weren't and aren't. For people who could stay home, it was much easier to embrace tough, responsible virus restrictions. 

In 2016, I wrote that much of the left wasn't too interested in what I called the politics of responsibility. For various reasons, I was and still am very much on the side of individual and collective responsibility. But most on the left were dismissive of this term and its associated proscriptions and prescriptions. In the pandemic, I noticed that people on the left embraced responsibility as a lodestar again. So you're right that there was some flipping and changing of political tenets. 

It will be interesting to see how politics emerges from this metamorphosis, but I don't worry about society following Foucault any more than I worry about us valorizing Adorno or Lacan."
2021-09-21 17:18:15,"Ross, I respectfully suggest you are overthinking this.

It's simple...the right has been drifting ""anti-science"" for years, often rejecting any policy or perspective specifically because it's proposed by experts, or scientists. If it's complicated and they don't understand it, well it must be left wing agenda, so must be rejected by the right. Into that growing GOP trend steps Trump to downplay the pandemic, and that just accelerates the whole process of science denial."
2021-09-21 17:20:39,"""I think mask requirements should have mostly gone away with widespread vaccination""  - Mr Douthat does not address the obvious.  Conservatives fuel doubt about vaccines which keeps the rate of vaccination relatively low in red states and rates of infection high. This results in the need for public health measures such as masking, which has nothing to do with politics.  The Right is driving infection rates, wasting billions of health care dollars then whines about basic public heath measures."
2021-09-21 17:20:56,"I would put it differently. All the evidence was, and remains, on the side of strong measures to control the disease and save lives. Those who defended freedom over death cost hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths, all over the world. The lesson now is that powers that be, left and right and anything else, know far too little about how to control a raging pandemic. Lots of more humility is something to carry into the future, with a strong rapid response as early as possible. Trying to fit any of this into a polarized politics simply feeds the fire. And by the way, many of the same lessons apply to climate change. It's difficult to work out a coherent policy, but many political postures are deadly."
2021-09-21 17:21:11,"Okay let's start with masks.  The definitive proof of their effectiveness - as far as our family is concerned - is that our son had his hair cut the same day the stylist was beginning to feel unwell.  Then she tested positive.  He did not. 

You can't get much closer to another person than when they cut your hair.  And yes, both were wearing masks.  Far as we're concerned, case closed.

In the greater scheme, life has periods of crisis.  You adapt, and yes you suffer, things like social deprivation in this case, or you do not survive.  

People have gotten too soft.  Too entitled.  Is it next-day delivery, reality TV, or having a powerful computer/entertainment system in your hand all day long?  They are not the same people who gutted it out during the Great Depression, WWII, and the 1918 flu.  

Me, I expected some bother in the short run to survive in the long run.  Piece of cake so far, compared with what my parents and grandparents went through."
2021-09-21 17:21:13,"Simply, the left is not anti-science. If Trump had handled the pandemic effectively, we would all be in this together. Douthat just has to put words into liberals’ mouths that were never there in order to justify his own rationalizing."
2021-09-21 17:25:23,"The COVID death rate, before the vaccines, was running between 1% and 2% of infections, worldwide. Call that the 'natural' death rate for COVID, if a society chose to do nothing to mitigate it's spread and impact.

1% of Americans is over 3,000,000 people. We've lost 650,000+ by now despite all we've tried. Is that ""better""? Is it ""better enough"" that we should just stop trying to improve the mitigation? Who decides who is the 3,000,000? Most of the deaths are among the elderly... but almost all those elderly are someone's parents, someone's grandparents... who decides whose parents and grandparents are ""OK to die"" to ""keep the economy going""?

Ross, the only way to 'win' fighting the pandemic is to beat it entirely. We have solid effective vaccines now that, if the 95% or 98% of the population medically able to get vaccinated -were- vaccinated, we could essentially halt the COVID virus in it's place. Global society has done it for smallpox, we've almost succeeded with polio. We -can- do this... but is there the collective will to do it?

Those who curry political advantage and power by putting other people at risk of death for the illusion of ""freedom"" and ""choice"" are deceiving those people, and cheating the entire population of the chance to control the virus effectively. This prolongs our economic disruption, and puts millions at risk, and kills thousands of people a week. We can do better - why aren't we?"
2021-09-21 17:26:18,"Funny how Douthat doesn't address ""the right's"" (d)evolving relationship to scientific data+research over the past few decades. Believing provable evidence has become a political act - maybe-just-maybe that has something to do with the role-reversal of our two major political parties?"
2021-09-21 17:26:55,"The behavior of others, who are not strongly committed to a binary point of view, may seem odd and hard to understand to those who are strongly committed to a right-wrong, right-left, conservative-progressive, authoritarian-libertarian perspective. What actually makes the behavior of others seem odd and hard to understand? I suspect it's both the perspective of the observer and the behavior of others. And, this messy possibility is likely not appealing to those who are strongly committed to a binary perspective. Perhaps, the politics of COVID are not really as weird as Ross Douthat claims."

2021-09-21 16:32:40,The irony of Covid-19 politics is the infectious spread of right wing media misinformation by fully vaccinated talking heads to an audience that lacks the critical thinking skills to see through the lies.
2021-09-21 16:39:51,"You can't really compare a plague that killed 50 percent of people with a plague that kills three percent. If Covid-19 killed 50 percent everyone would wear masks all the time, shivering in fear, hiding away from everyone, desperate for a vaccine. Left and right. But the intelligent reaction to any plague is to do what your scientists advise. The far right in America isn't bright enough to get that."
2021-09-21 16:56:20,"Ross, you’re helplessly stuck in the left-right construct from which you should have freed yourself ages ago. You should care about intelligent v. unintelligent, the former being informed by history and science, the latter ignoring both and depending on “gut” or whatever feels good.
And what feels good to a third of the country these days is reflexively doing the opposite of what is obvious to informed people. 
You have responded sensibly to the Covid crisis, while the voters you usually associate with, and defend, apparently prefer courting death, some very energetically. 
Stop referring to these people as conservatives or rightists or Republicans, and explain to the rest of us what they are and why. Because from here it looks and sounds as if ALL they want to do is hate and resent the rest of us."
2021-09-21 16:58:05,"Here we go again with the leftist straw man.  If a Renaissance historian published something in February 2020 celebrating dancing through the plague, you of all people should know he wrote it *before* that, when coronavirus still seemed like an exotic disease on the other side of the world and Contagion was still just a movie.  So I’m not buying that criticism of a centuries past public health measure generally constitutes an anti public health stance.

Nor were liberals giving a pass to racial justice protesters.  They were worried about protesters getting sick but saw the necessity.  George Floyd survived coronavirus only to be murdered by a cop.  Luckily the protesters largely stayed healthy because they were outside."

Getting lost in that tired little screen.

And I’m stuck but I’m still standing here with this little wild bouquet.

2021-09-21 16:37:46,"Much will be written about the Covid pandemic with the advantage of hindsight. Then hopefully, what worked & what didn't work can be clearly assessed. What doesn't work at the moment is refusing to be vaccinated out of some political ""belief"" that refusal is a form of protest. The anti-vaxers are starting to look more like a death cult."
2021-09-21 16:42:43,"Nothing weird about it.  Contrary to their own beliefs about “Christian” values, the right cares less about their neighbors.  The left cares more about the greater good, public health, the environment, equality, etc."
2021-09-21 16:46:36,"Here it is 19 months later and you seem to think that more draconian measures early on would have made a difference?  The virus is doing its thing around the world.  Seems to me that draconian measures can only make a temporary difference--perhaps to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed--but it is folly to believe that government can control this in the long term.  Everyone will get Covid, including the vaccinated (like me--vax in May, Covid case in August).  

What are the rational things to do, with this knowledge of endemicity? 1. Increase surge capacity of hospitals--how has this not been done over the past 19 months? 2. Focus more on effective treatments--why did it take a Florida governor to do this, 9 months after mABs were given EUA? 3. Shut down if a bad wave threatens hospital capacity--and I mean really shut down--close the car dealerships, the liquor stores, the restaurants--none of these phony shut downs where hourly workers are still exposed. 4. Convince people to be vaccinated; mandates do the opposite, in case you haven't noticed."
2021-09-21 16:10:15,"Douthat seems to be unable to see the simple facts underlying this crisis: (1) 670,000 citizens dead 
(2) A political party (the Republicans) that instead of acting to safeguard the public, uses this crisis to inflame the culture war in order to try to keep power.  670,000 dead, no matter;  its a small price to pay to insure that its tax cuts are not rescinded.

Douthat prattles on about the decor of the stateroom while the ship is sinking."
2021-09-21 16:43:54,"This bizarre article show how conservatives think about liberals.  Apparently, because Douthat read a book several years ago, he knows exactly how all liberals think.  We are all a mass of people who have an animus towards authority figures, traditions, customs, mores, and reflexively rebel against all of that.

Which to him explains why we refuse to follow traditional norms regarding, for instance, marriage and divorce, gender roles, workplace norms, and so on.  

So when Covid hit, he expected us all to rebel against wearing masks, the shutdowns, and so on. And conversely , he expected the converatives to dutifully follow orders and get their jab.  

Now he is confronted with evidence that his world view is quite wrong.  Does he admit that?  No!  He just rationalizes that our roles, for some unknown reason, flipped.   he cannot understand that liberals follow the science, wherever it may lead, and we just want to do what we can to end this scourge.

Conservatives, on the other hand, are clinging to their obedience to authority by claiming the Jesus doesn't want us masked or jabbed.  their authority figures like Trump and Tucker Carlson, and their tv preachers, all tell them that the vaccine will kill them.  Again, instead of realizing that his simplistic view that conservatives are now the rebels, he doubles down and then acts perplexed when it doesn't make any more sense to him.

The sad fact is that it isn't liberal v. conservative.  It's Trump-followers v. US."
2021-09-21 16:53:11,"It is also part of evolution that the fittest do not survive.  It is clear that the brain mutation which leads people to be virulently anti-science is actively being selected against.  While many who have succumbed to COVID were just in the wrong place and got a lung full of bad germs many times, we see from the simple fact that nearly all Covid hospitalizations and deaths at the current time are vaccine deniers. They are being eliminated from the population in the way Nature knows best. 

Because this is of their own doing, it is not dissimilar to why most rabbits nowadays, when spooked by cars, run parallel to the road. The perpendiculars have been selected against quite effectively."
2021-09-21 17:15:55,Douthat continues to insist on the flip-flop that wasn't. It is completely **not** about in-groups and out-groups as he wrote last week. It is completely **not** about the left shifting any position in favor of defiance to compliance as he writes today. It's all about openness to evidence on one hand and willful ignorance on the other. Everyone but Douthat can easily recognize which part of the political spectrum is associated with which.
2021-09-21 16:35:32,"It is not about left or right, sir. It’s about survival or death. The sooner we purge politics from this discussion, and “cut to the chase”, the better chances we have of making it through this horrible mess."
2021-09-21 16:39:05,"Oh Pleas! Looking after the health and wellbeing of their fellow citizens, the commonweal, if you will, has always been the purview of the modern Democratic Party, at least since FDR. And looking after themselves, their selfish, self-centered, self-absorbed desires, has been the purview of your party, at least since St. Ronnie made it all about ""me"". Have you heard of OSHA? The EPA? The FDA? The NIH?  All organizations that strive to improve the commonweal, and all supported by Dems and reviled by the GOP. (And before you go there, I know the EPA was established during the Nixon administration, which also championed national health insurance, but this GOP is the polar opposite of that GOP, except in the paranoia, self dealing and corruption aspects of the Nixon Administration.)  And the Dems are the party of regulations to protect the public, to foster public good, to keep workers safe, to keep drinking water and air and drugs and food safe.  You'd call that ""conservative"" because it has an air of authoritarianism (glad you recognize that conservatives are authoritarians!), but this is authoritarianism aimed at improving the lot of the masses. The conservative version is aimed at hoarding power and money and subjugating and exploiting the masses.  See the difference?  Please, give us a break about what ""conservative"" principles entail. Modern conservatism has nothing to do with the commonweal and everything to do with the petulant toddlers who have taken over the party."

How many times do they have to tell Mr. Douthat this before he actually believes them? The so-called “pro-life” party couldn’t care less about life. Republicans are willing to “sacrifice” people’s lives for their agendas. Abbott, De Santis and a slew of other Republican Governors are proof."
2021-09-21 16:42:50,"On Sunday I saw the Governor of Mississippi callously dismiss the deaths in his state as lagging indicators on national TV. He could have used the time to urge his constituents to practice mitigation techniques. But No! Instead he claimed that the “blue states” would soon be in the same position. 

Monday as I ran errands around town, I watched people with young kids milling around crowded stores maskless, it occurred to me that, despite my best efforts, I may not survive this mess.

America is a rudderless ship, pitching in a storm. We have no leadership, people are dying and everyone seems freakishly unconcerned.

2021-09-21 16:53:52,"Unsure we can use early modern plague outbreaks as cookie cutter for Covid, or even line them up against one another as it hit Venice in 1575 but Florence not until 1630; we forget the lifetime between those two dates and policy preferences had changed. Florence’s having eschewed the hospitals Venice used to confine travelers might explain the difference in mortality. Neither city knew what caused the plague, yet both remembered the Black Death leaving Italy a terror heightened by ignorance that brushed Covid only briefly, when we thought it might be more lethal than it is. Nor was Florence too enlightened; the lazzarettos of Venice stood in a lagoon where fewer guards were needed.

Schools are open in Covid-averse districts simply because they can’t keep them closed any longer when cases under age 40 seldom prove fatal. Covid zero remains attainable in New Zealand now, but Australia will have to abandon it. I’m doubtful of masks the way we employ them for hours of close contact in the classroom, but we’ve legislators on a cattle stampede to ban the mandates when at 60¢ apiece they’re worth it even for a 10% cut in transmission. An expedient Left glosses over the inherent coercion of disease control. Is that so bad, when US gravestones will number a million pretty soon? Hardly just a flu in Mr. Bolsanaro’s nose, and anti-vax on horse pills is just insane. Yet a marginal Right may come back sober if immigrant communities of color host conservative social values after all."
2021-09-21 16:29:02,"If Douhat could at least acknowledge that the ""right"" had already become the anti-science party long before the Covis epidemic I agree that what happened was truly weird.  Sadly, from climate change to evolution the right has become the party that celebrates scientific ignorance.  
And intentional ignorance has much has Trump explains a great deal of what has happened.  I distinctly remember a great many commentators worrying that last summer's protest were going to turn in to super-spreader events.  They also pushed for the protesters to mask up even has they recognized the pent up anger of the protesters.
It does seem like Douhat feels the need to excuse and even ignore the ignorance that the right now celebrates and try has he might this task is mostly dishonest and jst a bit tedious."

It doesn't erase all the work you've done over the years to strengthen the forces in the conservative movement that are now moving to devour their own (in addition to anyone else).

We've had bad COVID thoughts and actions across the political divide. Even still, with this piece, you're failing to recognize that despite anything you see on the ""left"", the organized machinery of disparaging public health measures is on the right. It is a point of pride within your Party to not take any precautions whatsoever, laugh off the millions that have been hurt or killed by this, and pretend that somehow this magically won't hurt us.

You're also being quite equivocal with the other side of the debate. Sure, there were protests over someone being killed by police. They were outdoors, moving, and largely masked. Not many are a fan of the property destruction that occurred, but you are failing even there to acknowledge that so much of the damage that was done (especially in Minneapolis) was from right-wing nutjobs that came to town to torch businesses. Kind of a trial run for January 6th.

Regarding that: You're also failing to recognize that nobody just showed up armed to try to intimidate or overthrow the government like some people we know.

You really need to pick a side other than the one you're on right now."

All Trump needed to do was to say then that this was a war that America was called to fight, appeal to patriotism and fight Covid. He would have won himself an election (no president loses during wartime) and maybe done something good to the country. That is that, for the  fabled political instincts of the man."

2021-09-21 16:45:25,"Looking at the daily deaths due to COVID, now over 2000, I can’t help but estimate how many of them voted for TFG.  Given that he lost by razor thin margins in five states, I further muse about the reality that through his idiocy- politicizing a deadly epidemic - he daily has increased his loss.  That is, the margin grows.  So in GA, now he would need to find some 22,000 votes, not 11,000 .  What kind of winning strategy is this?  A real head scratcher.
If this keeps up at a certain point even gerrymandering will fail."

He wishes the conservatives weren't a death cult and he fantasizes about a world in which leftists reject all governmental authority and public health--never mind the long history of leftists calling for government to clean up the environment, mandate work place safety and rectify myriad other social problems.  The fact that Douthat has to reference an obscure scholar writing in an obscure journal about an event hundreds of years old is all the proof we need that Douthat has not a clue about that which he writes."

They have 15% higher vax rate after starting 3 months after us too.  Also adding jobs at 3x faster rate than us and are just 1% off their prepandemic UE rate.  Here's the clincher, the Premier of Alberta, their most conservative province, just apologized for opening too soon as he just ordered more stringent controls to combat delta.  No dogma, no digging in, just looking at the data and changing a bad decision.  Lot to learn from our neighbors to the North."
2021-09-21 10:56:04,"Interesting take on our COVID responses. From my perspective it seems more status quo rather than flip. 

Supporting a governmental response to protect the welfare of our society has been a consistently liberal position for many decades (EPA, OSHA, FDA, FAA, etc). Abiding by the necessary rules to protect public health, weirdly, also a liberal position to take in our current bizarro world. 

Conservative opposition to COVID mitigation measures is consistent with perpetual opposition to all government regulation regardless of public benefit. 

Respecting the rights of others, a respect for science and a willingness to make small sacrifices to preserve oneself and the community should be universal tenets in the modern age. The weird thing is that these principles were once shared by most conservatives. Now many conservatives see these traits as weaknesses of liberals."
2021-09-21 12:12:46,"I just returned from hiking in northern Spain.  Everyone wore masks both inside buildings & outside in busy town plaza’s.  There were plenty of signs expressing the need to ‘take care of your neighbor’.  It truly brought home the extent of our polarization because just before my trip I had listened to a rant, by a visitor to my town, against vaccines & masks and how they took away his rights.  How did we come to this?"
2021-09-21 17:40:42,"Part of the problem is what passes for intelligentsia among libertarians. Recall the Great Barrington Declaration, which basically said the government had little or no role in public health and that lockdowns were a mistake. (They probably were.) 

Jay Bhattacharya was a GBD author. In retrospect a year later, this is what he said when asked if young people should vaccinate: ""They don’t have to. I mean, they can. I’m not against it. It’s an individual thing where you compare the potential harms of the vaccine versus the potential benefits, because it doesn’t stop disease spread. There will be some age where you say below it doesn’t make any sense because it would depend on the side effects.""

This is how rabid political philosophy warps the mind of a really smart guy. The ""potential harms"" of the vaccine have proven nil; in the statistical noise level. He completely ignores the demonstrated data that shows 90 percent of people hospitalized and 95 percent of COVID deaths are of unvaccinated people. We know this is true, yet to his libertarian mind, this is of too little value to even mention against the ""individual thing."" 

It astonishes me that people get to this conclusion, yet nearly 40 percent of people in the U.S. have."

2021-09-21 17:42:55,"The millions of COVID deaths worldwide is a slice, albeit a very large slice, of the entire pandemic pie.  Besides the unnecessary passing of so many loved ones due to COVID, especially since proven and approved F.D.A. vaccines have been developed and administered, other paradigm shifts in the world have and continues to occur.  

Supply chains have been vastly disrupted; the price of food, albeit in the grocery store or restaurant, has increased dramatically; the cost of fuel, utilities, rent and insurance continues to increase at alarming rates.

For nearly half of this country to turn its collective backs on a proven and effective answer to keeping COVID at bay, i.e., getting vaccinated, has resulted in a chain reaction which effects nearly all of us in one way, shape or other.

This ripple effect because some folks continue to stand firmly on the ""personal freedom of choice"" is not only selfish, but destructive, across the board, in the long run.

Just last week, another one of my co-workers passed away from COVID. She was NOT vaccinated, has small children and was a young women.  And to make matters worse, her family STILL does not believe in getting vaccinated. They said her passing was meant to be because she was being ""called home."" 

How exactly does one combat that kind of mindset? 

This isn't merely ""weird politics of COVID"" but a very dangerous and deadly thought process.  Being selfish and only thinking of oneself impacts each and every one of us."
2021-09-21 17:49:32,"Wonderful post. Thanks for pointing all of this out so clearly and eloquently. It dovetails with the conversations of late about the challenges of a two-party system and the ""us"" vs. ""them"" debates, where every position is a litmus test on a political future.

Couldn't agree more that things have become phenomenally weird."
2021-09-21 17:51:39,"Foucault, much like Donald Trump, 
attracts strange bedfellows. 

But don’t forget, Ross—
his argument that institutions of power seek to control the body and sexuality is best evidenced by the anti-abortion bounty hunters of Texas and the Catholic Church’s singular obsession with abortion. 

I’d love to have a conversation where someone brings up the simple fact that across the board—women paid for this pandemic the most, as moms, caretakers, career women. 
The losses for women are massive. 
And they just keep coming. 
What academic theory is vindicated by this heartbreak? 
And what lengths are we women willing to go to finally be liberated and equal?"
2021-09-21 17:53:18,"I appreciated that Mr. Douthat pointed out that a lot of the early conservative suggestions about herd immunity were wrong. I don't often see that kind of willingness to reflect and admit that political views like those were wrong, and I genuinely appreciated it. We need more of that willingness, across the political spectrum. 

I do, however, think that the left wing of politics is largely in-line with a broad role of government during emergencies. Maybe that's changed through time, but that is very much where liberal politics have been for some time. The left has long been a staunch promoter of collectivism, which is entirely consistent with left-wing approaches to the pandemic."

 to do the right thing. This essay's logic is fundamentally flawed in that regard."
2021-09-21 18:02:06,"I'd be really curious to hear more info backing up the idea that this is really such a big ""switch,"" that pre-pandemic liberals would have tended toward a devil-may-care attitude to pandemic restrictions (aside from the single book-reviewer anecdote Douthat provides here). Liberals have tended to have greater trust in scientific experts and greater eagerness for collective and proactive governmental action to address major problems. Whereas conservatives have so often readily dismissed scientific consensus and drawn on libertarian language to support a do-nothing response, especially if the do-nothing response seems the cozier route for the already-cozy. (Case in point: the climate change conversation over the past decades.) Perhaps Douthat truly is correct here, I'm just not yet convinced. And so columns like this read almost like odd attempts to credit the successes of the more ""liberal"" approach (listen to scientific experts, take vigorous action collectively in response) to the side of our intellectual divide that -- in reality, has utterly failed in its response to the pandemic."
2021-09-21 18:03:43,"Sadly, tragically, many people will not do the right thing, if given the choice.  Could be Polio, seatbelts, taxes, or taking the door off a discarded refrigerator.  Your hero said it best.  Trust but verify.  And to that I would add, punish non-compliance.  If that's a liberal or conservative thing, so be it.  The real reason so few freedom fighters showed up for last week's protest can be summed up in one word, prison."
2021-09-21 18:04:58,"I wasn't quite sure why Mr. Douthat tries to thread this particular needle, until I got to the end to discover that he doesn't know, either. The observation of the ""flip"" is interesting only insofar as it points to a strain of anti-intellectualism that, like COVID, infects people regardless of their political valence. Also, his only datum is a single review of a book that appeared once in NYRB.

To me, a more interesting element is the sorting principle across the hawk/dove divide: why is one person willing to tolerate loss of liberty while another clings to liberty like it's a cell phone? The answer is obvious to me, and the data to support my claim is available to anyone who reads social media: the liberal embrace of COVID mitigation is a communitarian response to a problem we can solve only with collective action, while the conservative entrenchment against it stems from an unwillingness to accept personal hardship for the benefit of one's fellows.

Indeed, Douthat points out that the health police described in the book review were motivated in part by factors outside their public health mandate: fear of other, theocratic power, and social control. Which modern political party most embraces those aims?"
2021-09-21 18:07:19,"There has been no flipping. To use one essay from a ""left leaning"" publication to represent a change of heart by Democrats on how to deal with the pandemic is absurd. 

I think this opinion piece by Douthat summarizes his often tried, specious attempt to put all left wingers, i.e., Democrats, into a carefully designed partisan box. Left wing and right wing are labels that mean nothing in the context of the argument between libertarians and the supporters of science. Democrats have been consistent in their support of the science around conquering the pandemic while Republicans are primarily the ones fighting back against vaccinations and mask wearing.  

It is obvious that most among the anti vax crowd have taken this position because that is what their tribe supports. After all, if Democrats insist on it it must be bad. 

A Republican just made the absolutely absurd argument that Democrats have taken the pro vax/mask stance because they knew this would drive Republicans to not take the vaccine or mask up, resulting in Republicans dying!  A masterful 3D chess move? Now that is a flip of a different level that Douthat has somehow overlooked referencing in his column."
2021-09-21 18:08:30,"I think Mr. Douthat's interpretation of the left's hawkish position on covid measures as being a ""flip"" by ignoring a move to potential authoritarian control, is misplaced.

The left (and I am excluding the mostly fringe anti-vaxx left) has for decades been respectful of science.  It's the right, anchored by the evangelical Christians (think evolution) that has been fundamentally anti-science.   

For the left, science and social science (and morality) drive government programs.  For the right, such science is mostly irrelevant, since government programs (aside those that reward your backers) are verboten as an ideological matter. 

Sure, when the FDA or the EPA approves a drug or chemical based on industry pressure, the left will not be happy.  But where, as in covid, you have a broad based medical consensus, the left is on board.  On the right, you have people rejecting the medical consensus about covid and vaccines, but accepting of social media posts about equally experimental medicines like mono clonal antibodies, and of purely anecdotal evidence of anti parasite drugs.

So, the weird politics of covid, aren't that weird.  What you have, without putting too fine a point on it, is, generally, one group that possesses certain cognitive abilities and critical thinking skills, and another that has them in short supply."
2021-09-21 18:12:01,"Ross, I think your colleague P. Krugman wrote that the GOP-base's non-scientific response to the pandemic was the natural outcome of being fed years anti-science bunk that matched up against what they wanted to believe.  Be it climate change, fiscal spending, tough on crime policies or whatever, the GOP eschewed empirical data and advice from ivory tower eggheads, in favour of their gut beliefs or ideological beliefs.   So with the parties separating out into one that's more educated and scientifically literate and one that vaunts a modern day know-nothingness, are we surprised by the reaction to the pandemic?  

Also Ross, I know the London Review of Books is a great publication, but to take a pre-covid article from there and posit that this is the Left's position seems like a but of a straw man.  You're a better writer/thinker than that."
2021-09-21 18:16:48,"The left prefers to assert that we all must subscribe to some sort of universality, and a disease that spreads rapidly and noticeably through just about any population supports the idea that we must all be restricted equally.

The right prefers various expressions of clan-or-creed superiority, and would prefer a disease that can be said to be spread among and by out-groups as an excuse to exert control.  And it's certainly going to chafe at restrictions on spending time among clan or fellow confessors.

Unsupported speculation about actuality, as well as opportunistic hypocrisy - well - we're all free to exercise those, aren't we?"
2021-09-21 18:19:51,"How is ""chasing Covid zero"" relevant to a discussion of American public health policy when we have multiple states with zero ICU hospital beds open, neighboring states overrun with their overflow, hospitals going to ""crisis standards of care"" (rationing), and people with treatable medical emergencies dying during frantic, unsuccessful searches for hospitals that can take them in?"
2021-09-21 18:20:08,"Douthat can't get away from framing everything as a right versus left issue, and then positioning himself as perhaps just a bit more right than the two sides. It'd be much more interesting to discuss the substance of the issue, rather than to frame everything as an ideological battle with two sides locked in.

Of course, a discussion on substance would show that the right is quite wrong, or perhaps not even able to engage with any substance on a discussion on substance, which is not really tolerable to Douthat. And so the rest of us are subject to more of the same from him."
2021-09-21 18:20:09,"I enjoy readingDouthat's columns because I find them nuanced in a way that I like.

I just wanted to say that it doesn't surprise me that the politics of Covid are extremely weird, because the pandemic itself is so unusual.  The historical event that seems most like what we are now experiencing seems to me to have been the Spanish Flu pandemic.  And that happened before virtually all of us in the United States had been born.  Most of us have no direct experience of an event of this kind and magnitude.

I find myself shifting in response to the pandemic in a way that causes me to relate to the title of the column and the way in which Douthat traces his path through various changes of attitude regarding  his social and political responses to Covid."
2021-09-21 18:22:19,"The polarization of COVID politics is because the left believes in  science and protecting the country, and the right does not. The right only cares about power, even if it means advancing misinformation and causing deaths."
2021-09-21 17:25:19,"Talk about politics. Vaxart has a Covid oral vaccine that protects against all variants and likely provides immunity for years. Sterilized immunity kills the virus before it enters the bloodstream. No cold-chain issues. Drones can deliver to rural parts of the world. Can produce enough pills in 4 months to cover the planet. End of pandemic.

But there's one problem: Big Pharma is in bed with the Feds and is suppressing Vaxart's disruptive technology, because once the pill comes to market the Big Boys will lose billions since injections will no longer be needed.

Some things never change."
2021-09-21 17:44:55,"Douthat’s apparent assumption that every book review in the London Review of Books is left of center, and that every book review reflects some official ideology of the publication is silly. One book review about one book is a very thin basis for any argument about anything. (And especially in a publication that relatively few—hardly anyone in the grand scheme—even read.)"

2021-09-21 17:54:47,"The narcissist Donald Trump in the White House was weird about COVID politics! Nothing’s weird about Trump supporters lining up behind him or detractors against. Furthermore, he botched the pandemic response so badly, there’d be nothing weird about supporters becoming detractors for that reason alone.

He not only lied to the people to minimize the danger he knew full well, but he also bragged to Bob Woodward about lying to the people to “not cause a panic.” As if Woodward were there to give credit where it’s due, for brilliantly calculated, timely lies!

He routinely blamed the rising number of cases on testing for cases, as if making Donald Trump look bad motivated some deeply-messed-up, partisan conspiracy of counters! He went so far as to block cruise ships full of sick people from docking at port, to avoid the appearance of a sudden case spike. How many healthy cruisers became infected while languishing at sea, to avoid contributing to the count that President Trump feared would make him “look” bad?

He took four years worth of credit for blocking travel from China, and zero responsibility for blocking travel from Europe. His order directly caused super spreader events at the unprepared Customs lines of JFK, O’Hare, Atlanta and other big international airports, when every panicked American student, tourist and businessperson rushed home at once, spending unmasked, undistanced, unscreened hours in tightly packed lines.

The election was Trump’s to lose and he lost it."
2021-09-21 17:56:08,"I think a more appropriate comparison would be using the book ""The Decameron"" by Giovanni Boccaccio, It was allegedly written during the black plague by a group of selfish elites who were in a situation to escape the plague by leaving their city-states behind and hiding out (read quarantining) in a palatial  villa outside of Florence.  

They escaped the plague leaving everyone else behind to die."

2021-09-21 17:31:35,"Douthat’s piece here is yet another of his attempts to “own the Libs” via some obtuse pseudo-intellectualism and over-generalization.  The sense of inferiority on the right lately is so strong that many folks who claim Christian values are willing to put themselves and their facile understanding of freedom above everyone else’s safety and well being.  Would that those who feel so inferior would actually work to improve their understanding and reasoning rather than claiming their ignorance and selfishness are just as good as knowledge and a sense of community responsibility.  What a fragile sense of self and freedom if those things are threatened by an effective vaccine and wearing a mask.    The anti-vax, anti-mask crowd are behaving like adolescents, not like thoughtful, principled adults. (With apologies to the many adolescents I know who are far more mature than their elders.)"

You think mostly wrong. The first 'I think' would really have been dangerous, given what we didn't know, and given what we now know, the second 'I think' may be also unwise.

I am certainly far left of center, ideologically, but I have always accepted that emergency powers in times of health crises are part of the costs of living in a human society.   Yes, they are hard to apply equitably, and yes, as with ALL powers given to governments or individuals, they are likely to be abused to some degree. But risking your neighbor's life is not liberty, nor is it patriotic. The premise of Ross' argument, however, is flawed in that the strict left/right dichotomy, and the leanings of each group Ross describes simply didn't exist in January 2020. Not in my neck of the reality woods at least.  It does now thanks to deliberate and persistent demogoging of, primarily, the far right."
2021-09-21 18:25:45,"“recently seemed like a core left perspective — that stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian and inevitably ratify various forms of inequality and social control”

I’m sorry but this is not a core left perspective, but it is the straw man that this entire “flip” op-ed is built on. 

A core left perspective is that government (I.e., us) has a role to play in protecting and improving the lives of its citizens. 

On the other hand, it seems a core right perspective is that government should be as small as possible and stay out of its citizens’ lives as much as possible.

It is unconscionable that a significant segment of the population will not accept the greater good of NOT DYING from covid because the remedies are inconvenient and signify weakness since it requires acknowledging the needs of others. The “government overreach” as call it is a result of their unwillingness to accept their responsibilities to society at large. 

The right is contorting itself it an attempt to advocate a “freedom” not to be vaccinated. Was getting the polio vaccine a matter of personal choice?"
2021-09-21 17:27:09,"Thank you Mr. Douthart, for providing us with a column today that hits so squarely on what I find most infuriating about your writing. In the field of logic, it is called a ""straw man"" argument, and you use it - dare I say - liberally.  In column after column you describe a position which is supposedly held by all folks to the left of the political spectrum, with little or no explanation beyond a sound bite generalization, and then use these assertions as a basis for your arguments.  Examples in today's column include ""left-wing academic folly,"" and the supposedly ""core left perspective — that stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian . . .."" (What?)

These mere assertions do nothing to move discussion forward at this time of extreme polarization, and may even contribute to the problem by endorsing the kind of name-calling generalizations so rampant in our culture.  I am eager to engage with a thoughtful conservative on the important questions of our time, but that is not what you are providing.  If I was grading your column as a paper, I would tell you to stop being so lazy."
2021-09-21 17:02:28,"There used to be a Republican Party and a Democratic Party in America.  Both contained a variety of political positions, with some general differences that made one decide to be one or the other.

There was and is a ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" which tend to be the ones who decide the primaries and leave everyone else with no candidates that seem like ""us"" (the big middle).

But COVID has separated a new herd of folks into a group we should call the ""Me/My/Mine"" party.  I have met folks who I consider moderate republicans who question the science.  It is not their ""freedom"" they say is being taken away, it is simply the noise and confusion.  

So much of what is happening with COVID is not necessarily politics, however some is, and unfortunately it is coming from idiots like De Santis, Johnson, Abbott and Paul, who encourage the Me/My/Mine instincts of those with impaired reasoning powers."

2021-09-21 17:41:46,"As others have mentioned, one review in a liberal publication—which might have reflected idiosyncratic view of that reviewer—does not support the “flip”  analysis.  Indeed, another, more apt pre-Covid example is John Barry’s excellent book on the 1918 influenza.  He noted with approval the few cities that enacted strict quarantines.   Not a whif of complaint about public health measures.   I don’t know Mr. Barry’s politics, but I think it’s safe to say he is your basic left of center writer (the exceptions are always obvious because they are so rare).   So if that book is the judge, there has been no liberal flip at all."

Crossing 680,000 deaths, because no one you know has died of Covid gives no pardon to idiots who refuse a free vaccination, then seek medical help when they contract the virus.  ""No room at the Inn""...at least for the ignorant self-abusing dupes.
Or just maybe Ross, those who oppose masks and vaccinations stand for nothing other than opposition to science, health, and knowledge.  Then I ask, when they do contract the virus, and seek help at one of our over-crowded hospitals, they ought to pay for their treatment.

There is plenty of evidence that conservatives favor their own dogma over science.  They deny climate change.  They cheer drilling for oil on environmentally sensitive lands, and favor burning coal.  Many listened to Rush declare smoking isn't as bad as doctors say--until he died of lung cancer.  

They believe embryos without a heart have a heartbeat, and that abortion clinics must follow pointless regulations to ""ensure women's health.""  I could go on and on

The scientists are dealing with a novel coronavirus so must remain flexible in how they deal with it.  They have tried to avoid politics in the process.  That isn't a 'leftist' position.

Conversely, Trump decided from the very beginning to deal with Covid solely with regard to how it affected his reelection prospects.  Scott Atlas was telling him that 30% immunity was herd immunity.  Atlas and Texas Lieutenant Governor Patrick basically wrote off the elderly and overweight as disposable.  Trump often spoke of overweight and old people being the ones at risk, while young people would only have mild symptoms.  That entire approach was echoed by the right wing media network.

2021-09-21 18:34:56,"Science is the human process, increasingly accepted over centuries, of discovering the truth through rigorous testing of evidence.  Mr. Douthat can embellish the politics around the pandemic with all the abstract, elitist, philosophical scaffolding that he wants, however, at the level of the average American across this country the most obvious and dangerous general political difference this pandemic has clearly exposed is that the American Right is anti-science and the Left is pro-science.  It is bewildering that conservatives, like Mr. Douthat, don't concede that America's status in the world, both culturally and economically, won't be irretrievably weakened when, now revealed clearly in the 21st century, roughly half the population rejects this tried and true process.  Isn't it time conservatives stop with the philosophical game-playing and address how to fix that problem?"
2021-09-21 18:35:31,"First, it's tragic that we did not have an extensive testing program to identify where the virus was flourishing when the pandemic hit our nation. Trump didn't want it because he thought that knowing the numbers meant a loss for him. 
We didn't have enough testing kits and mistakes were made in ramping up a testing program. It failed and the disease flourished. 
Now, we have vaccines and knowledge that, even vaccinated and asymptomatic people can spread the disease. Warp Speed produced effective vaccines, but it has failed to stem the pandemic. Kids still can't be vaccinated.
It seems smart to be cautious. It even seems to be conservative. So wear masks to protect others. It's not that hard. 
I don't know if it's libertarian, but I would have a problem forcing people to get vaccinated. I do not have any problem at all with requiring that those who make that choice stay out of the public space. The idea that people have a 
""right"" to endanger others and to take the chance of an even worse variant seems crazy to me.

2021-09-21 18:39:32,"Covid has brought out both ends with very little middle in the society, a bizarre flash point about which is preferable - 

1. communal protection against serious disease, 
2. the freedom to expose ourselves (and each other) to disease
Realistically, there is not a third choice of avoiding exposure

This flashpoint is a proxy for so many issues of identity, shared responsibility, definition of truth, respect for authority/leadership, respect for each other, future vision.

As a proxy, Covid has only exploited and deepened all that already was there.   It did not create the divisions, it merely widened and crystalized them.  

Now, I (almost) equally annoyed by the saintly friends on the left who look disapprovingly at my (occasionally) maskless face, as by the saintly friends on the right who feel compelled to explain why the vaccine was a such dangerous choice for me to make.  

I am thoroughly sick of widespread dogmatic, religious 'belief-based' approach to what is a public health issue. 
As I used to teach in biology, evolution is NOT something to 'believe' in anymore I 'believe' than photosynthesis.  This is science, not belief.

The funny thing is, while the right has been defending their choice to not vaccinate, they have now lost tens of thousands of votes to death.

While the left has been advocating free vaccines for all, especially for those with underlying issues, they have saved many who will vote against them!

People in this country get a flu jab as winter sets in without a second thought because the alternative is misery and the clogging up of precious A&E space. 90% of people over 16 have had the covid vaccine and deaths at this point are rare.

They are authoritarian the same way seat belt laws are authoritarian, the same way health inspections of food production facilities and drinking water quality are authoritarian, the same way drunk driving laws and penalties for murder and tax fraud and child labor and kidnapping are authoritarian. These ""liberal"" rules are on the books to protect people from those who have no qualms about actively harming them.

Right-wing authoritarianism, conversely, is about helping right-wingers self-indulge. It's about deputizing private citizens to round up those who need abortions, ignoring the depth of the issue, because abortion makes conservatives squeamish. It's about valorizing an angry group of thugs that tried to ransack Congress. It's about swamping society in guns so right-wingers can shoot people they don't like, if it comes to that.  It's about cutting services to the poor so that the rich can be more self-indulgent. It's about controlling access to the polls so that conservatives can get what they want politically.

2021-09-21 18:47:47,"Talking about an ideologue. Douthat is looking through glasses so distorted by his beliefs, that all his and everyone else's views  are automatically categorized as left, right, libertarian, etc. 

How about I simplify it for you, Ross? I don't want to die. That is how I relate to Covid. Although Covid-19 only has an overall mortality rate between 1.6-2.2%, for some groups it is much higher or lower. As an older person >65, it is higher. I therefore treat it as an existential threat. Furthermore, Covid appears to have longer term health risks, including respiratory and circulatory problems, decreased kidney function, and cognitive problems that have turned some people into invalids. 

Humans exhibit wide behavior when confronted with danger. Some turn into masses of protoplasm quivering in a corner, while others say nice kitty to a tiger munching on them. However, because human behavior has such a large effect on  transmission of a very contagious pathogen, doing what you want, irrespective of how your behavior affects others, has population level consequences.

My political views pale to insignificance in comparison to my fear of death. Perhaps Mr. Douthat is more sanguine about death than I am since he thinks he is going to heaven."
2021-09-21 18:49:49,"If public health regulations ratify various forms of inequality and social control, what needs to be done is to perform some social engineering to reduce the inequality and find less oppressive measures of social control.  

Those who hate oppressive measures of social control are nevertheless willing to embrace very oppressive measures to protect the lives of fetuses until the moment of birth -- unless, of course, such measures would make social controls unpopular.  So the woman seeking an abortion, often a sympathetic figure, is not punished for fetus-killing or attempted fetus-killing.  Those who help her are much easier to demonize, so all demonization is shifted to them."

I see so many parallels with our own moment in history, and yet this discussion in class once prompted jeers at the crazy Puritan logic."

From the exact origin of COVID in Wuhan, China to the vaccine mandates from the chief executive officer of the USA has been fueled by a biased press that did not want to present an unbiased coverage of events but tilt the scales towards a change in political leadership of the country. The incidence in NY which we all wish was devoid of violence but nevertheless has raised opposition to the vaccine mandates and vaccine passports.

An Italian restaurant in NY city, Carmine's has released new video footage of 3 black women from Texas in an ugly brawl with Carmine's white hostess being physically assaulted over vaccine proof causing a concussion. Okay the 3 were arrested and face charges of assault and criminal mischief but now BLM NY CHAPTER TO protest in support of  TX Tourists accused of assaulting NYC hostess. 

""I believe that this NY City vaccine passport will be used to keep Black people out of spaces, and if we don’t stop it now then the police will use it as an excuse to harass and arrest our people,"" a BLM spokesman said in a statement yesterday.

2021-09-21 19:00:51,"So the point is the 'left's' usual anti-authoritarian and the 'right's' pro-authoritarian leanings have 'flipped' in re covid. Huh? The 'left' has typically followed the authority of scientific fact, data, and regulation -- other public health and safety issues and regulation have been championed by the left -- because they were supported by science. The right's anti-authoritarian reaction - is purely that -- reaction for a political reason. Because the right's 'base' is scientifically illiterate, they will respond to ill-defined buzzwords like freedom and liberty without a shred of understanding that without control of a deadly virus, freedom and liberty ain't gonna happen.   If Trump was any kind of decent dictator he would have seized on Covid as a top-down national emergency instead of blowing it off. The right would have been masking as patriotic duty and the unmasked would be beaten to a pulp by citizen enforcers. And the left, following the science, would have no choice but to follow along and Trump would have been re-elected. Nobody has flipped anything -- the left's position on this is science-based, the right's is political."
2021-09-21 19:03:50,"All one needs to do is listen to Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, or other conservatives who spurn masks, spread doubts about the vaccine, and advocate quack treatments, is to know that a large number of conservatives truly are culpable for many of the Covid deaths in our country.   
And have things changed Ross? How did conservatives approach HIV/AIDS when it was ravaging our country?"
2021-09-21 19:05:20,"Communities where mask-wearing in public is common have much less flu during flu season.  In our own country, efforts to fight covid have reduced the incidence of flu.  

Whether or not it is worthwhile for everyone to wear masks in public during flu season should be a practical decision based on evidence and probabilities.  We made the decision for everyone to drive on the right (or the left) side of the road, and enforce it with laws, because it makes sense as a practical way to avoid traffic accidents.  We could make it a matter of personal responsibility and individual choice to do what the majority does in terms of driving on the right or the left, but we dont.  We impose the general choice on everybody, and this does not limit any freedom other than the freedom to endanger oneself and others.

Enforcing this rule on everyone does not prepare or accustom us to have all our choices determined by rules.  It merely accustoms us to obeying rules that make obvious sense to us, or to people who have acquired the expertise necessary to understand what makes obvious sense (like electricians about obviously unsafe wiring)."
2021-09-21 19:06:04,"Ross, isn't there an inherent tension between the libertarian right's position that vaccine mandates are an unacceptable intrusion on ""personal medical and bodily autonomy"", and it's position that the state has the right to force a woman to carry a fetus to term?  What about the pregnant woman's personal medical and bodily autonomy?"
2021-09-21 18:49:23,"Douthat lost all credibility with his sarcastic juxtaposition of ""Soylent"" and the left.

Virus don't care about politics, left or right.   Virus wants a host, without which it cannot live.   Virus is like the Borg on ""Star Trek.""   It finds new members or it dies.    And when it finds a new host, it can mutate into something else.

That's why the science says vaccinate, mask up, or distance.  It keeps the virus from getting to a new host.    No hosts = no more virus.

For a microbiologist and an attorney, this is second nature.   If a clairvoyant would have told me 10 years ago that many Republicans would have gone against the science, I would have been incredulous.

The truth is that both erudite Ross and hoi polloi cannot conceive of what a virus is.   And what we must do in unity, and in sacrifice to stop it.    This business about making vaccination a political football is dumb beyond belief.   

You can do the right thing now, or impose a huge cost to yourself and society later.   Not getting vaccinated is the antithesis of good citizenship, and also a perverse form of existentialism which has revealed something about people in the digital age.

There are many with the implicit credo, ""Consumer products or die.""   And there is some truth to that.   The buying and selling of stuff is our life blood.

But when Mother Nature imposes other imperatives, we must reorder priorities or we will die.

Hence, I am very afraid that Covid is the harbinger of a societal collapse."
2021-09-21 19:00:34,"Ross makes too much of the book review.  It's not representative of ""the left"".  The left, moreso than the right, has always been behind efforts to pursue the public interest. Although the left often acknowledges that policies aren't always implemented in a fair and unbiased manner, and that they sometimes impose harm on the powerless and marginalized, the left also recognizes the legitimacy of public policies that force individuals to curtail some liberties for the sake of the public good. 
The right however? Other than when narrowly defining the public good as ""arranging things the way we want them to be"" i.e. the public good as the embodiment of right wing preferences, they tend to poo-poo the concept of public good, and they certainly prioritize individual liberty even when (or perhaps because) such liberty causes harm to society. 
The traditional, civil, paternalistic, cautious, and conservative right wing that Douthat remembers fondly doesn't exist anymore. If he wants to see people putting public health and well-being above personal desires and wishes, he'll need to look to the left. That's the only place it is found anymore."

2021-09-21 19:01:03,"Well, Ross, we call you ""pro-Covid death cult"" because of such a behavior of yours that you compare Covid to a 17th plague and describe the former as ""less lethal"". Us, liberals, compare it to other transmissible diseases, natural disasters, and war casualties in the modern US history and decided that Covid is far more lethal. We mask up and embraces jabs in our arms, not because of or in spite of our political views, but rather because we don't want to die from a now largely preventable disease. You wouldn't consider getting a tetanus shot every 10 years or having safe sex to avoid AIDS a political statement. This is where I'm perplexed by right wing, which appears to me unreasonable and nonsensical."

Well maybe they *should* go away, if we ever *do* have widespread vaccination.  Surely even Mr. Douthat recognizes that widespread availability has not led to widespread acceptance?  Although with the awesome reality-denying powers of the Right, I realize that assumption may be ridiculous."
2021-09-21 19:16:45,"When I was in college, I wrote a paper comparing the responses to the AIDS pandemic in the 80s in three OECD countries--US, German, and Sweden. Of the countries, Sweden had the most restrictive response; whereas, the US under Reagan was generally hands off with minimal response to the disease.
I think memories can be short, but you don't need to go very far back to see a similar American conservative response to a deadly disease as the one today."
2021-09-21 19:17:08,"Two things: first, Douthat's ""conservative friends"" who assured him  that the virus was not as virulent or that it would burn itself out were epidemiolgists, then he is not more informed that Donald Trump was. Second, Douthat's fascination with how liberals embraced an authoritarian approach to suppressing covid 19, thus rejecting their embrace of Foucaldian suspicion of the state's control of our bodies, versus the right's taking their place in that perspective, is just intellectual play. The simple truth is that Foucaldianism is being confronted by a stark and deadly reality. The left recognizes the challenge. The right chooses to see it as expressing their freedom, which sustains the pandemic and kills us.

2021-09-21 19:30:39,"It's not nearly so weird as Mr. Douthat depicts it. Both left and right have libertarian streaks in their ideology spectra. The left, however is not marching into state capitals armed to the teeth or plotting to kidnap the sitting governor of a state, or, call whatever you like, an insurgency, an out-of-control protest or a tourist outing, trying to overturn the results of national presidential election. What is different between the two streaks is simply the right's lesser concern, notwithstanding its trumpeted religiosity, for the health and welfare of their neighbors."
2021-09-21 19:32:07,"We have no way of knowing whether the dancing of these two Florentine girls sickened or killed anyone else.  All we know is that it got some people in trouble with the authorities.  

The ""right’s sense that the left wants us all to mask up and eat Soylent in our disease-free habitats forever"" is a fantastic example of the use of paranoia to ultimately win power.  The left's sense is not paranoia, but rather a justified fear of paranoia.  The right's ""live free or die"" attitude is bringing death to many.  

Those who want to live free or die should go to the back of the line for admission to hospitals if they are unvaccinated and get covid, and not be admitted when their admission would stretch resources and lower standards of care.  Such a policy would fix the overcrowding of hospitals and allow for the true triumph of personal responsibility.  Those who chose to risk their lives and health by not getting vaccinated will be allowed, enabled, and even forced to do so.  

As increasing numbers of nurses burn out or revolt against working to save people from an illness these people chose to risk, the unvaccinated will arrive at the fair result of their decisions. What is unfair is that people who suffer heart attacks or auto accidents will suffer dangers they do not deserve."

2021-09-21 19:14:48,"Douthat puts forth this tortured essay, as twisted as his last, attempting to change the simple narrative that the republicans have become a death cult in order to further their politics.  

No matter how much you try to distract by setting up Foucault’s critical theory as a straw man, what it boils down to is a majority of people will endure what is scientifically necessary to keep themselves, their family and fellow citizens alive.  Your side would rather bring hospitals and health care heroes to their breaking point and die in the process to own their deranged political positions led on by their fanatically hypocritical leaders."
2021-09-21 19:24:29,"Go read about the Black Plague.  There were plenty of weird things going on around that.  People didn't know if they would be alive the next day.  They didn't know how it was transmitted.  There was no treatment for it.  Once a person had it they tended to die.  Entire families and villages were wiped out.  It changed history.  There were people set adrift because they were the sole survivors.  It seemed to many that it was the end of days.

This has been nothing like that.  We know what needs to be done.  Wear a mask in public.  Keep your physical distance.  Wash your hands.  Get vaccinated.   Ignore what the GOP and other conservative extremists are saying.  

Care about your fellow human being.  Think of someone other than yourself and your convenience or discomfort at having to wear a mask.  Stop pretending that science is an elitist subject.  In other words, grow up and be an adult.  Act responsibly."
2021-09-21 19:29:48,"One London Review of Books reviewer hardly represents the thinking of the Left.  What a ridiculous claim.
The Right only favors government control when it oppresses the poor and enriches the wealthy.  That is why the Right has swung away from support of government as those governments invested in egalitarian policies.  
As was obvious from the events of Jan. 6, the Right would be more than happy to enforce government control as long is it is in support of an Authoritarian regime overthrowing a democratic government.  One only need look at the numbers of Republicans who readily voted in both the House and Senate to overturn the Presidential election.
As usual, Ross is just wrong."
2021-09-21 19:30:40,"The country's divisiveness is driven by the Right's cognitive dissonance and a total inability to agree on the facts.  Facts presented by ""the mainstream media,"" governmental organizations, and others in authority (e.g., the medical community) don't match their world view, so they cling to whatever contrary information is available, regardless of how obscure or the mental contortions required for their narrative to make sense.  So as liberals scratch their heads about why conservatives won't look out for their fellow citizens or how conservatives are processing the data differently than liberals, keep in mind conservatives have bought into a fundamentally different world view, where the vaccine itself is the threat and all the info we've been provided about its effectiveness and the dangers posed by the virus's are lies or misinformation."
2021-09-21 19:39:52,"Although Mr. Douthat's exposition is scintillating - from an intellectual standpoint - we have a little problem here in the land of the free and the home of the brave. 

I listened - briefly - to the exposition of an alarm technician who took great exception with wearing a mask in my house while he installed a new backup battery. 

I'm not sure if he had read Foucault, but in those three brief minutes, he gave me such a comprehensive distillation of all his rationalizations for not wearing masks, or getting vaccinated, tested, social distancing, etc. Then he told me he had COVID twice. Bingo!

After beating a hasty retreat to my front porch, I left him to his larger work. As soon as he departed, I (with mask) opened every window in the house, jumped into my car, and went to the beach for a couple of hours during the airing-out process. 

While the shrimp boats offshore tended to their larger business, I mused about the relationship between power and knowledge. And I wondered if rationalization could - in the final analysis - be a rationale?"
2021-09-21 19:36:57,"Douthat illustrates exactly why our current political system is at a dangerous stalemate: he divides every issue into something that is inherently right wing, vs left wing, and finds it incomprehensible when humans do not follow this artificial pattern. Its a result of our outmoded 2-party system that has led to us framing everything in this idiotic binary world view. 

Look, human societies are vastly more complex than simply having 2 categories of solutions. What is liberal or conservative in American is not even the same as what they are in other countries. 

Our 2 party political system is like going to a buffet for dinner and even though there were dozens of entrees to choose from, they were arbitrarily divided into 2 different serving lines, and you were only allowed to go through one line, and had to take one of everything.  So even though you picked a line that several things you liked, you got stuck with a serving of brussels sprouts, while the other line got a nice salad you preferred.

The closest to a solution I have seen so far is to implement rank choice voting, as some states are doing. This would allow other parties to grow that adopted platforms that drew from whatever source offered the best solution, rather than the one that conformed with the declared ""correct"" choice."
2021-09-21 19:47:22,"The weirdest thing of all, Ross, is how the conservatives of the first days of the pandemic were basically acting normally, as they had for decades.  They resisted government except in a FEMA-style emergency, when government intervention was expected and invited.

I say that is weirdest because it is ... from our current perspective.  Now, a very significant number of so-called conservatives are willing, even eager to let the system unravel.  Some even want to take advantage of the chaos and encourage the process.  That covers the worst elements of the Jan. 6 capitol insurrection.

What account for this shift?  Even you have apparently felt some tremors from that shift, although you retain a mostly traditional conservative approach to the pandemic.

My theory is that this whole dynamic is actually part of a process of maturation amongst humanity. Traditional conservatism fit what I call ""late childhood"", that period of time when 9-12 year-olds reach a point of stable intelligence unaffected by hormones that makes many of them seem ideally intelligent, cooperative, and emotionally balanced to parents and other authority figures.  

Then comes adolescence, which many parents think is an unadulterated disaster and actually a retrograde step.  But of course it really isn't.  No one can successfully jump from age 10 to 20 and end up a stable adult.  

The same appears to be true of human society.  2016 marked the entry into collective adolescence. The pandemic intensified it."
2021-09-21 19:51:22,"As usual, Douthat feels obliged to find a false equivalence between the left and the right where there isn't one.  There is nothing new or different about the left's view of public health: we believe in it.  Applying the best science we can to protect lives through public health is not a descent down an authoritarian rabbit hole but simply common sense.  As has been demonstrated innumerable times during this pandemic, these measures have been applied successfully in the U.S. ever since the time of George Washington, and they have not led to broader state control but have disappeared when the need was no longer there.  

The approach of conservatives to the pandemic has, by contrast, been truly bizarre.  A party that was happy to put in place all kinds of measures post-9/11 to prevent any terrorist casualties and that is willing to follow an authoritarian leader like T---p off a cliff is perfectly fine with nearly 700,000 COVID deaths in the name of ""freedom.""  This is not about having the openhearted spirit to frolic in the grass; it's about denying science and turning a blind eye to mass death.  There's nothing equivalent here at all."
2021-09-21 19:52:52,"Ross postulates and postulates, but it's really not that hard to to figure out.  The left operates on rationality; the right, on irrationality."
2021-09-21 19:53:15,"Whatever Ross thinks about the politics of covid, one governor in particular stands out as being most successful in coping with a pandemic. No need to name names. Trumplicans thought they could oust a guy who won his election in a landslide because he did everything he could to keep people alive. That’s the difference between left and right."
2021-09-21 19:54:41,"I heard about the lasting impact of the plague on Siena, Italy, when I walked through the city with a historian. Before the plague, Florence and Siena were rivals, relatively evenly matched. After the plague, in which Siena lost 30-50% of its population, Siena was no longer in the same league. Some people in Siena still feel antagonism toward Florence; the rivalry endures. But the effects of the plague mean that in recent centuries, it has been ""advantage Florence."""
2021-09-21 19:57:02,"Observations and views from a historian regarding the plague in 17th century Florence hardly characterize the perspective of “the left” regarding pandemics and public health. I don’t know that they reflect the book author’s and reviewer’s viewpoints on public health. These historians’ comments are rather flimsy filling for today’s Ross Douthat straw man.
Perhaps Douthat should have looked at more recent pandemics to support his thesis, such as it is. The left has tended to resist disease-based stigmatization of marginalized groups.  During the emergence of HIV, these groups included gay men, IV drug users, and, briefly, Haitians. The right had some interesting ideas about controlling the epidemic, such as tattooing infected individuals, many of which were strongly opposed by liberals. One might make the case that these measures might have reduced the infection rate, whatever the cost the targeted groups. Whether any evidence supports that is another matter.
In reality,  government public health bodies and activities have largely been the result of progressive or liberal efforts, not conservative priorities. Especially under contemporary conservative philosophy, health is an individual responsibility. Science and health care institutions and governments that back community-based efforts are mistrusted, particularly when initiatives involve risk or sacrifice on behalf of others. Covid denial and vaccine refusal, however often irrational, involves no flip for the right."

""Slippery slope"" arguments are dismissed as the paranoia of the out-group.  The ability for a well-intended government to injure liberty in general becomes an abstraction not worth worrying about - until it does.

This is a lot of words dancing around the crux of the fight: mask and vaccination mandates. Calling mask mandates draconian is absurd, and we've had mandatory vaccination laws across American for many, many years.

From Marx’s belief that a society’s politics, laws, policies flow from their economy, to feminist history theory which looks at the reaction to women by a society to its politics, culture, policies, to critical race theory which looks at the reaction to minority races as the cause for a society’s politics, culture, policies, to now “Critical Trump Theory”, our country’s politics, laws, culture, and policies all flowed in reaction to one Donald Trump.

If Mr. Trump had simply tried to rally the nation to common cause at the outset, acknowledging the gravity of the threat being faced, the whole question of intrusive government action would have been very different.  The efficacy of concerted voluntary compliance might have sufficed more widely.  

In actual fact, though, he was far weirder than future historians are likely to be able to fathom.  He made no effort to summon the better angels of our nature.  And so the worse angels have killed hundreds of thousands who should not have died, have torn the brains from a third or so of our populace from any roots in empirical reality, and have elevated a bunch of nihilists to positions of power in one of our political parties.

Douthat is right that it has become a dialectic attitudes toward government power, but he fails to insist that this came to pass solely because a significant proportion of our fellow citizens have gone completely bonkers, and their insanity was not only enabled but encouraged - egged on - by a Nihilist-Narcissist-Nutcase-in-Chief."

As far as I know, most of the George Floyd demonstrations were held outside, where the scientific evidence about dissipation of viral particles in the open air indicated that Covid transmission was less likely. And—again, as far as I know—most of the George Floyd demonstrators wore masks, which the scientific evidence indicated were effective against Covid transmission. 

To equate masked crowds chanting and shouting in the streets, parks, and public squares with unmasked anti-restriction, anti-mask (and, eventually, anti-vaccine) crowds chanting and shouting in packed meeting rooms strikes me as inappropriate.

In the time of Covid, these are not merely different approaches to the expression of differing political opinions. They are fundamentally different activities that pose different levels of risk."

I think the biggest factor by far in the reaction of ""right vs left"", is the cult worship of Trump. A significant number of his cultists have equated being against anything a Democrat proposes as the highest achievement--no matter the consequences. Thus you have anti-vaxxers who will literally deny to the death, the existence of the virus, effectiveness of the vaccinne, etc etc ad-nasueum. It is as much a Mental health issue as anything else."

2021-09-21 20:32:36,"I feel like many others in this comments section that once again is  rolling its eyes at Ross, the lovable, tempered and “gentle”, and yet still manages to make me pretty frustrated. It is one thing to make sure there is blame to go around on all partisan sides of the pandemic response but it is quite another to bloviate so hard to make the blame game playing field seem more even. Even if it is only a little. 

All I can say is that I am glad this will be your last words on this for a while Ross. The pandemic blame share is incredibly lopsided for a reason. Republicans of all stripes have lived in an upside down world since this thing began and have only gotten worse. I hope there will come a day when you can just say “Republicans are wrong on this one and even though I can site a few studies or columns by more liberal writers it doesn’t really matter, because in general democrats and liberals have been overwhelmingly more correct in their response to the pandemic”. Full stop."
2021-09-21 20:30:05,"Oh Ross, always trying to pretend the ""right"" is actually grounding their knee-jerk selfishness in some sort of philosophy and this all comes down to how one reads Foucault.  (The people showing up to school board meetings to protest mask mandates are not basing their objections on post- structural ideology.)"
2021-09-21 20:36:04,"I live in Michigan.  After massive protests against the restrictions, our state supreme court struck them down almost exactly one year ago.  Since then, we have ""guidelines"".

The system seems to be working better and with less social friction.  Given a choice to open or close, most restaurants are closed completely of closed to dine in service.

About the only thing the Democrats have control over is the public schools.  Private schools that are preferred by white people went to court and won, as did churches.  Minority students have been devastated by the closing of the public schools last year but they are back in class now.

It works.  Look at our numbers.

What we really learned is that our political leaders lack the authority to place appropriate restrictions against the public during a pandemic."
2021-09-21 20:42:04,"I don’t understand your premise that liberals were always against public health mandates. Liberals are supporters of bigger government involved in promoting the public good. Also, I don’t remember that there was a partisan debate over the Salk polio vaccine. As a child I remember standing in a long line with my parents and our neighbors to get the pink sugar cube with the polio vaccine. My parents were liberals but we lived in a Republican majority town at the time."
2021-09-21 20:42:14,"Biden was saying that there will be other pandemics, and we need to prepare for them.

That’s probably true, but it might be 70 years until the next one. More likely, there will be something else that nobody was expecting. In the same way that very few were expecting the pandemic."
2021-09-21 20:46:25,"Whether there was a flip or not, this digs into two separate ideas that underly political discourse. 

The terms 'left' and 'right' come from the seating arrangements at the King or Queen's table: People with power on the right - Church, Military, land owners etc - the people who wield power through organzation. The rest sit on the left. (This is Norman Davies' view from ""Europe""). 

Echos of this persist strongly today e.g. right wing religiosity. 

Then there is the way people adopt politics: they often work out which is their 'in' group, then adopt the set of ideas that goes with that group. Why else is there such strong correlation in people with, say, support for abortion and concerns about climate change? Most people don't think about the ideas - its easier not to. And they know if they step out of line on one, they will get punished by their in-group peers.

So what happens when a Donald Trump aligns himself with the powerful and organized, recruits a disorganized rabble to vote for him, and labels the alliance 'right wing'? Are you really expecting logical purity and consistency?"
2021-09-21 20:42:41,"""a world where it was normal for a left-leaning publication to run an essay gently celebrating the defiance of public health rules""

The terms ""left"" and ""right"" are very useful, but Douthat is so fundamentally institutionalized that he really seems to think the way the world works is, there's some left-wing Vatican out there that is in command of all its followers, who all obey it in a shared sense of community belonging.

A ""left-leaning publication"" published a particular article with a very specific passage almost two years ago, and now some left-leaning somebodies somewhere don't generally agree with it? How weird!"

Wherever the political winds might find victory is where the political party will flip. Consistency of policy and constituency over time would be much weirder than the sudden flips (fiscally conservative when convenient?) parties make on a regular basis."
2021-09-21 20:47:42,"Lemme just say . . . I don't think that much of the Fox news audience is reading Foucault at all, let alone ""differently.""  I mean, who is actually reading Foucault outside academia?

Likewise, I wouldn't take a reviewer of an academic book about the plague in Italy as an exemplar of the Left's view on health mandates.  The only real data point for this, I think, is that there definitely was anti-vaxxer sentiment pre-Covid amongst certain segments of the hippie left.  

The flip to my mind is that people of the center and left definitely didn't trust Trump on Covid (bleach, etc.), but they are more inclined to go along with scientific consensus (even if it's sometimes wrong).  So medicine - Trump = gimme the vaccine."
2021-09-21 20:48:11,"Or maybe, just maybe, the left is motivated by how much ""authority"" is grounded in good science and how much it is grounded in arbitrary and capricious abuse of scientific authority by small groups of politically motivated bureaucrats. Yet somehow we're supposed to believe that when Dr. Fauci implores us all to get vaccinated, it's exactly the same as when Texas passes strict new abortion laws. It's all just the same broad category of ""public hygiene"" authoritarianism. And Russ just cannot IMAGINE any difference between them except that the first is favored by one set of political interest groups and the other is favored by another set of political interest groups. See, Hobbes was right. It's all about self-interest. Because Texas legislators and Anthony Fauci are the same, with the same credentials and the same training and the same motivations. Riiiight."
2021-09-21 20:58:12,"I think the big problem is that many people mistakenly conflate the left and the liberals, as well as the right and conservatives. The left has always been an advocate of authoritarian policies in order to achieve the results they believe to be desirable, just as has the right. The liberals, like the conservatives, have advocated personal freedom and responsibility and the use of argument rather than authority to achieve their goals. 

Today, the majority are left or right, the conservatives and liberals are a hunted down minority in politics."
2021-09-21 21:00:56,"Liberals are not undergoing some metamorphosis on the role of government, nor has the right taken a position different from what one would expect. The right wing does not want government to intercede with any assistance. That’s been their position at least back to Social Security or any health and safety regulations. Those tenets are on steroids now, to the point at which they’re willing to kill their neighbors. The left has long pushed for government to become involved in improving the quality of life. They may not trust the government to wage war against other nations, but they have no problem spending tax dollars to save lives or improve their quality."
2021-09-21 21:10:33,"I'd be slower than Ross to make blanket characterizations about attitudes toward public health measures by the ""left"" or ""right"". My positions I think are actually quite close to Ross's, but if he were to read my exchanges with covid-skeptics on the right, he'd likely (and erroneously) conclude that I, an American liberal, had ""swung against any acknowledgment of what until very recently seemed like a core left perspective — that stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian and inevitably ratify various forms of inequality and social control.""

Ross should keep in mind that much discourse is reactive, not explanatory. In replying to someone insisting that covid is overhyped and public health measures ineffective and tyrannical, of course my replies will focus on the aspect of why I think covid is serious and public health measures necessary. You'd get a very different response if the prompt was to talk about my overall beliefs on how we should approach the pandemic -- but that latter question is rarely the one being asked in discourse.

I can't speak for American conservatives, and probably not even for American liberals, but as one American liberal, I'll just remind Ross not to mistake online discourse, which is generally reactive, for a full and accurate representation of a particular view on any subject."
2021-09-21 21:23:31,"Your previous article only looked at the political aspects of a death reate 10 times higher.  But a higher death rate would probably also have been associated with more pronounced symptoms in those with non-fatal case, i.e., asymptomatic transmission would not have been as big a problem.

Some people would have been too sick too come to work, decreasing exposure.   Or people might have avoided anyone exhibitng any sign of cough or cold.  The process would have changed in many ways."
2021-09-21 21:31:28,"If the Right were all lining up and getting their jabs, the Left, or parts thereof, might well take more libertarian stances. The dynamic today is one in which every action by one side creates an opposite reaction on the part of the other. Tribalism has taken a strong hold in America (even if there’s something to Tyler Cowen’s “weirdness” thesis, which there is).

If Trump had won the election in 2020 (which in his mind he did), the situation would look different and probably better in terms of the vaccination rates. The Left would clearly be more skeptical, but not to the extent the rightwing is with Joe Biden as president.

The GOP’s voters are awash in misinformation to an extent still, even with all that’s happened, under-appreciated by most conservative intellectuals. They are REALLY out-there.

Beyond that, is it so surprising that people behave unpredictably? One can write a book on cat behavior that will tell you how your cat will behave in such-and-such a situation. You can’t do that with humans beings. None of us truly understand either ourselves or others as well as we like to pretend. I’m not convinced you’re really as surprised as you say."

Knowing what we know now. Not exactly an impressive thought, is it? No one has, or had, a crystal ball. The time to make decisive, draconian decisions has passed. Americans no longer are willing to go back to any semblance of what was in place in March and April 2020. And people with a national voice, like Douthat (do that?) failed their readers."
2021-09-21 21:53:02,"The crisis of the pandemic lays bare the defectiveness of conservatism as it is now purveyed, and most especially of libertarianism. Not only is it morally repugnant to abandon consideration for others, it simply doesn't work. A libertarian approach to the scientific and social complexity of modern society is equivalent to turning over national defense to Revolutionary War re-enactors. 

Dogma is so much more appealing than reality to those who live in a Jeffersonian fantasy world of yeoman farmers living miles apart from each other."
2021-09-21 21:57:58,"Mr. Douthat’s essay is replete with left and right reactions to the pandemic and therein lies the problem - the politicization of a pandemic. The virus’ only allegiance is survival and until we get our proverbial heads out of the sand of politics, the virus will have its way."
2021-09-21 21:59:20,"I think Mr. Douthat is straining to cast the ""left"" as being traditionally against public health measures that reasonably and temporarily curtail liberty. Most people throughout American history have accepted low-level and/or temporary curtailments of their liberty as the price for maintaining life and health for themselves, their loved ones and their livestock. It's common sense, not politics. And the ""left"" (whatever that means) is comfortable with science, so they are a group for which trust in the effectiveness of public health measures is not a hard sell.  This column seems like an example of bending over backwards to achieve an equivalence that isn't really there. The real question, perhaps inconveniently for Mr. Douthat, is why is 20% of the population so alienated and distrustful of traditional public health authorities that they are willing to risk suffering a horrible death by Covid and spreading it to others rather than accept a vaccine that is virtually risk-free."
2021-09-21 22:01:27,"As a retired physician, as I read early reports out  of Wuhan, I was disturbed, and remember an early professor saying ""Human beings may self annihilate,  but if not they will become extinct from some sort of viral pandemic. This was in 1976.

How true the observed shift in stance by right/left you describe so well."
2021-09-21 22:14:34,"It's enlightening to see how far medical science has progressed since the 17th century, and how quickly political science has regressed in recent years to 17th century drama and intrigue.  Some seek truth and developed powerful new technologies and treatments, others seek power at the expense of the truth and all who oppose them, especially the elites of medical science.  Creative solutions and wealth creation, upended by self-destructive politics.  21st century technology, 17th century outcome.  Go figure."
2021-09-21 22:15:34,I have been thinking along these same lines recently as I try to figure out how I have shifted from being a progressive liberal to someone who can barely stomach the authoritarian tone and fear laden messages of our public health system as well as the deferential reporting by most of the media. It’s time to open our minds to the possibility that we/science/the liberal left doesn’t have the answer to every question and that the individual should be allowed to govern themselves and take control of their own health. Thank you for illuminating these shifting sides. I very much feel the sand shifting beneath my feet.
2021-09-21 22:15:53,"It seem to me that Progressives have behaved exactly on cue.  ""Do something"" to mitigate harm but without counting the cost.  In a healthy society Conservatives would be counting the cost (not just railing about their ""freedom"") and trying to push the net societal response to an emergent threat toward the center.  Unfortunately, Conservatives have decided just to oppose whatever Progressives come up with, good or bad, cost effective or not.  

An infectious disease means that one person's actions or inactions harm others.  A Liberal society can legitimately incentivize/punish actions that prevent harm to others/harm others."
2021-09-21 22:20:33,"I am politically liberal, but I agree with Mr. Douthat in this column in many respects.  I thought some of the initial restrictions to keep people home were appropriate given the unchecked spread of COVID-19 disease last year, and and I do not mind continuing to require or wear a fabric mask indoors and in crowds to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19 now after I have been vaccinated but many others have not yet been.   I do not understand why political party or position on the political spectrum should prevent all of us from taking modest steps to help each other during this pandemic.  

The point from the column that deserves more reflection is what Mr. Douthat refers to as ""the new high-tech hygiene regime, about how hard it might be to dismantle it once it has outlived its purpose,"" at least when it comes to businesses that now find themselves not just asking employees to affirm whether they are vaccinated, but instead collecting or planning to collect voluminous details about which particular vaccine brand employees or visitors may or may not have had, including vaccination dates, numbers of doses, images of vaccine cards or the like.  What happens to this data, how long it is kept and whether this practice spreads to other vaccination records or beyond remains to be seen.  These questions should be considered carefully to avoid future discrimination or overstep into private lives."
2021-09-21 22:22:03,"Isn’t Douthat’s universe tidy? Even on the rare occasions when he'll admit that his side—the right—is wrong, he finds a way to say that the left is even wronger. If only he were as diligent about  pointing out the flip-flops of his ideologically purist counterparts, such as those Republicans who, for example, champion individual choice about mask-wearing but scoff at the idea of choice when the issue is abortion, or those who happily raise the debt limit when Trump is in office but scream bloody murder when the Democrats want to do so as a result of the ravages of the Trump-Republican tax cuts."
2021-09-21 22:28:49,"Douthat doesn't want to admit it, but there are few conservatives around. Yes, a conservative would favor reasonable restrictions on liberty, including distancing and vaccination. But the current right is a combination of libertarians and theocrats. Libertarians care only about themselves, not society (some like Thatcher don't even think that society exists). Theocrats are fundamentally irrational and automatically opposed in a reactionary way to anything advocated by liberalism and science. 

Why do liberals support reasonable restrictions on personal freedom for the benefit of all? They are rational, just as are the few conservatives still lurking about.

Douthat can't help but identify a false equivalency in his need to put down liberals. He admiringly quotes the following speculation about the left: ""...how hard it might be to dismantle it [social control] once it has outlived its purpose...."" That is nonsense. No liberal will have any trouble dismantling unreasonable intrusions on privacy. Note abortion, for example. Liberals will always be the champions of self-determination for all (not just themselves)."
2021-09-21 22:31:30,"Note how hard Mr. Douthat worked to establish a spectrum along which the politicization of COVID represents a reversal of national trends. 

In a much less tortured way, Trump's opportunistic and racist COVID policies (and their contemporary ""dovish"" adherents) serve the same short-term interests of the rich and privileged that Republican policy has for decades.  

Would that conscientious Republican thought leaders might apply the same mental agility toward righting rather than rewriting the path of our recent history."
2021-09-21 20:53:26,"Like many of this writer's columns, this is as clear as mud.

Racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and uptake

Methods We performed a cohort study...(March 24, 2020-February 16, 2021). We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (unsure/not willing) and receipt.

In the U.S. (n=87,388), compared to White  (OR =1) non-Hispanic participants, the multivariable ORs of vaccine hesitancy were 3.15 (95% CI: 2.86 to 3.47) for Black participants, 1.42 (1.28 to 1.58) for Hispanic participants, 1.34 (1.18 to 1.52) for Asian participants, and 2.02 (1.70 to 2.39) for participants reporting more than one race/other.

The  more than three times higher COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy  of blacks has an understandable historic background  (blacks were lied to by whites for centuries)

2021-09-21 21:54:25,"So in her review Ms. Maglaque glorifies disease spreaders and explains the success of the Sanita's policies as the result of a magically less virulent form of the disease that hit Florence alone. Nope, not much reality denial going on there. 

As for the flip-flop, I'm afraid I never saw one. Pretty consistently I saw the right wing deny reality, downplay basically everything to do with Covid and actively resist any measure that might lower the case count. Just as consistently I saw the left take Covid seriously and do their best to minimize the body count. 

Mass gatherings: BLM and other 'left' demonstrations were populated by people almost universally masked who were social distancing to the extent circumstances permitted. Large gatherings of any sort on the 'right' conspicuously lacked both masks and distancing. 

There aren't two sides here.  There's one group composed of people who understand that a diseases do not require belief, acknowledgement, or acceptance from its human hosts. There's another group that appears enmeshed in reality denial and as a result has spread sickness and death

I could go on, but I'm running out of space. 

Lastly, the right reads Foucault? Next you'll tell us they read Fanon and Bakhtin."
2021-09-21 22:32:27,"I think Douthat is overstating the flip--views on abstractions like liberty and security are totally flexible--though he provides some good explanations for how the cultural coordinates ended up mapping out. But one thing not to underestimate: per polling, professional-class urbanites often found their health, finances, and satisfaction increase during the lockdown, whereas small business owners were likelty to suffer financially."
2021-09-21 20:54:55,"Ross loves the ""straw-hat"" arguments.  Since when have liberals been against public health requirements?  One (according to Ross left leaning) journal runs an article that he thinks romanticized the scofflaws during an 17th century plague and he thinks that is where the left stands?  Please.  

Since when have the right supported any social rules?  When you see a Gadsden flag ""Don't tread on me"" that is usually flying next to the equality sticker?  Nope. When has the right supported clean water, pollution restrictions, environmental protection, recycling, etc?  Please Ross what planet have you been living on?"
2021-09-21 22:05:01,"Putting politics aside maybe it's simply the case that the 'left' respects science and sees nothing wrong with shut-downs and mandates because that's what rational societies do when faced with an unknown plague. I can never remember any leftists ever speaking out against polio, small pox or TB vaccines? The real problem is that the right has become irrational and views scientific consensus as if it is just a matter of opinion. No one on the left ever said that science was a matter of opinion; many on the right don't believe in evolution,  but do believe that a man named Jesus is actually the son of God, that God will answer their prayers and that horse medicine is better than Moderna. What are you going to do?  Seeking spurious equivalencies or misplaced ironies should not be one of them."
2021-09-21 22:16:14,"Here we go again: the desperate commitment to finding left-right symmetry in everything as a systematic way of normalizing asymmetric right-wing depravity.

There is nothing weird about the covid debacle, just unfortunate. 

Right-wing politicization of and total intransigence on every issue does unfortunately create an unwillingness on the part of liberals to concede even the slightest point to opponents arguing in bad faith. But that is as ordinary a situation as exists in the world, sadly. There is simply no inclination to compromise with people who are not arguing honestly or fairly and who will maximally exploit any concession to their own benefit and your detriment – and who invariably also use this response as proof that their prior behavior that initiated the whole sad affair was justified.

This is perhaps the deepest and most intractable problem caused by the current Republican duplicitousness: It creates vicious circles.

Aside from this: Liberals were not suddenly in favor of authoritarian control of public health – we were hoping not to die unnecessarily and cognizant of the fact that rules would be necessary to keep our more selfish compatriots from killing us."
2021-09-21 21:20:46,"I think it is very difficult to label something as 'right' or left when the republican party simply apes whatever its leader tells it to do.

The really 'weird' thing that Ross fails to mention is that the right wing no longer has any identifiable tenets beyond simply  listening to T acolytes amplified by right wing media.

To cast this as 'Puritan v. Jacksonian' is to give far too much respect to a malignant group of know-nothings willing to trash our republic in service to a grifter."
2021-09-21 22:34:10,"I think it's a bit hard for people to remember the way they would have thought about this current scenario before it happened. So it's interesting that Ross has this vivid memory to remind him. But maybe Ross is the exception, and maybe that left'ish publication at the time simply published that essay to give the debate some room, irrespective of their own prevailing views.

I'm also not sure it's fair to compare a lockdown in the 17th century, with their less-than-enlightened views regarding certain classes of people, with modern times. I'm sure certain classes of people suffered more than others back then, as certain classes of people bear more of the brunt of Covid even now."

We have gone through all the craziness about the masks and stay indoors to stay outdoors  but the most damaging is the idea that we can't address natural immunity from an objective standpoint, that to is political. At a time in February and March when the vaccines were coveted and we watched the tractor trailers leave Pfizer labs the idea that those who had covid could easily and were getting the vaccine before someone who never had it is just absurd. We even had every 30 year old politician from every federal and state legislative body getting it before the 85 year old. A race top the life boats on the Titanic every man for himself. The nation is a disgrace.. All of this caused by Trump induced PTSD on a fragile population."

I would like to know what is different about September 2021 from September 2020 on the pandemic front?

Cases, deaths, hospitalizations, work from home, are all about where we were a year ago.   

And yet no one is talking about flattening the curve so hospitals don't have to ration care.

Misrepresenting the severity of the pandemic today because of the pandemic of the unvaccinated red states by threading the needle on alleged anomalies on how the left and right view the issue is journalistic malpractice 

As is the entire MSM campaign to normalize what these bioterrorists are doing to the country right now."

I realize how hard it must be when one comes from Ross's position that there is some absolute and critical requirement for religious institutions in order to have a good and kind social order. To witness the inanity and insanity of the positions that these religious institutions take must make Ross's defense of them excruciatingly difficulty. Alas, it is a job he must take on or else abandon his fundamental basis for all he's argued in the past. Let go, Ross.  Call them out for the dogmatic lunatics they are.

2021-09-21 22:41:02,"""I think schools should have been open everywhere last fall.""

Spoken like someone with no skin in the game. I happen to have a daughter who was teaching a 5th grade public elementary class, and 5 grandchildren, the oldest 2 ready to start first grade, the others all in daycare of pre-kindergarten.

First, many children did well with remote schooling, especially with so many parents also at home. (I looked at the year-end report cards for about 60 of the 5th graders.) Two of them did very well, qualifying for national honors. About 20% mastered the 5th grade material, another 50% gained over end of 4th grade, but did not get to full 5th grade standards, and the remaining 30 percent either did not advance significantly or lost ground. 

But there is another side. Essentially every one of those children would have had COVID if schools had been opened. It is statistically unlikely any of the 60 would have died from COVID, but very likely that from 10 to 30 % would still be suffering from ""long-COVID"" -- with the ""brain-fog"" that precludes learning. Failure to learn in 10 to 30 percent is a huge sacrifice to make rather than accept that the next 2 or 3 years will include a lot of catch-up learning for many kids. 

Also, most of the families would also have been exposed to COVID via their families. 

To me, the tradeoff is clear: closing the schools last year was objectively a huge win, despite the cost."

2021-09-21 22:41:29,"I don't think it's weird at all. The left-right covid dynamics were determined at the moment Trump publicly downplayed the virus. Right wingers, as they always did, responded by loudly and stubbornly supporting their king, which required dismissing experts and evidence even when the situation was clearly dire. Then tribalism took over, with each side digging in, always opposed to the other side's latest idea. (However, the sides are obviously not equivalent: the left was at least attempting to respond to reality, while the right's bizarro fact-invention machine and mind-boggling disregard for public health makes them culpable for the deaths of many thousands.)

I do wonder how the covid culture wars would have played out if Trump had taken a more Sanità-like approach at the beginning - which, as Douthat says, would have been ideologically consistent. Obviously the right-left positions wouldn't be exactly flipped from today's, but they would be different."
2021-09-21 22:41:57,"What flip? For the right, it seems, it is the primacy of he individual over everything else. For the left, there is also the group to think about. It seems to me, nowadays the right is much more extreme individual - all rights and no responsibilities (except for other people). They have forgotten the value of thinking of others."

2021-09-21 22:49:17,"I have to disagree with Ross's underlying premise.  Which side is the more communitarian and which the more libertarian is highly selective.  The right wants to crack down on deviance, as it sees it, but has no trouble with any idiot owning and even flouting a firearm.  Public health seems to be in the left camp, if for no other reaon than the need to protect ""the least of these"".   If the left wants to control firearms, why not even more destructive viruses?"
2021-09-21 22:59:47,"There was no flip. This is another attempt on Mr Douthat's part to argue that the left is as crazy and destructive as the right. The left simply responded to a public health crisis by saying we should follow the science. The right, as always, insisted we ignore the science. The left recognized before the right the magnitude of the public health threat and that if we acted decisively we'd have fewer dead people. The right looked at their cult leader, so insecure he thought wearing a mask was un-masculine, and followed him into the insanity of politicizing masks and distancing and vaccines."

They are not infallible sources but part of a global cooperative of trial and error on a massive scale and information sharing with peer review.  They have advanced knowledge.  They have made us rich.  They have saved billions of lives.  But they are not systems of faith.  They are no different in principle than a cooking site where chefs submit their favorite recipes and others try them and submit comments.  They provide a way for all of us to do together what none of us can do alone.  We rely on experts for the simplest reason.

2021-09-21 23:08:18,"Ross, I disagree that there was any significant ""flip.""  You state that suspicion of stringent public health responses was until recently ""a core left perspective.""  I don't recall either the left or the right talking a lot about public health prior to Covid.  And surely, your one book review example, while interesting, proves nothing about the left as a whole.

Ultimately, the political place we ended up is pretty consistent with attitudes about government regulation established long before Covid.  I suspect we would be in much the same place today, regardless of Trump's response to the virus."

The sorts of people calling for mandates, your Dr. Faucis and Dr. Wens of the world, are the sorts of people with whom members of the professional managerial class tend to identify. As contemporary liberalism is increasingly defined by the sensibilities and priorities of the PMC, rather than, say, the small business owners and hourly wage workers who have been hit hard by lockdowns, it is hardly surprising that approval of the public health regime is stronger among the left. The current disputes taking place over mandates, in all likelihood, track along similar cleavages as did the earlier ones over lockdowns. 

That said, however, I'd like to know what the mask wearing ""hired help"" at the recent Met Gala event might have to say about all this."

About when masks should be worn. Etc., etc. In his favorite field--religion, specifically his Catholic religion--what he believes may be all that matters.

Unlike the right wing the left has always supported  government environmental measures that would protect the public. The left has supported everything from taking lead out of paint and gasoline, to stopping toxic dumping in waterways and the ocean.  to controlling smog pollution from autos. The right not so much. The left has supported anti-smoking measures and restrictions on second hand smoke, which faced vocal opposition at first. Of course the left also recognizes the proliferation of lethal weapons in our neighborhoods is a public health crisis that needs serious regulation. Enough with the both sides do or did it.

But I also blame the antiscience woke, who run around in masks post vaccination, and demand others who are vaccinated do the same. The question I get from vaccine skeptics repeatedly is why vaccinate if nothing changes. And I have to explain that when you are vaccinated, unless you are seriously immunocompromised, everything does change. You get your life back. Masks are not necessary for the vast majority of people. This accurate and scientifically true, data based argument is the only ticket to success I've had with the antivaxx crowd. And that's the point: pandemic theater isn't a victimless crime. At the end of the day, mask and be neurotic if you want to be, but don't condemn others who follow science.

I think he confused the historic rebellion against conservative social authoritarianism (drinking, drugs, art, sodomy, blasphemy) as a rejection of authority itself, and the libertarian left often does means it that way,  but ""the man"" people railed against was whoever was trying to keep them in a ""decent christian lifestyle"" and not so much whoever was trying to stop a wildly contagious disease. 
Over the course of this pandemic, authoritarianism has been the lefts best attempt to get the party going again without anyone dying from it. I don't see this as a conflict."
2021-09-21 23:40:07,"The selfishness pervasive in American culture has been revealed during covid - 670,000 fatalities, and many people still don’t care. 

Here in Hong Kong, one of the most urban and densely packed cities in the world, Govt and citizens together have a common interest to save lives and stave off the infection. ￼

The result to date - around 200 fatalities, 12,000 cases, and thankfully no delta cases (yet). 

Compare these figures to cities / states in America with similar populations - NYC, Arizona.  It’s not close. 

In Hong Kong, everyone wears a mask, whether vaccinated or not. We don’t want to catch the virus, nor spread the virus. Schools were closed when the virus was circulating, and with very few new cases the schools are open and all kids still wear masks. 

It would be unimaginable that someone in Hong Kong would yell and shout and complain about wearing masks, and argue that their rights have been infringed upon. 

Bottom line to fight against a pandemic requires community spirit and caring, not selfishness, and a Govt who makes decisions based on public health, not politics."

Most red states are doing badly because their Governor or their Trumpkin majority legislatures are fighting mask restrictions and soft shoeing the vaccines or peddling in outright lies. 

Blue states to a large extent are doing their jobs in managing the pandemic as best as they can.

One group is led by science and the other by lies, half truths, and fighting scientific recommendation. Several of the red state Governors are aiming for the Presidency and their fights against mandates are to show they are standing up to the power of the Federal Government.

First, Trump deranged the country, calling on people to FREE MICHIGAN and otherwise rebel against widely-accepted public health restriction, politicizing the nation's public health.  Second, we took ""crushing the curve""  as an excuse (with Trump's lurid encouragement) to abandon safe community practices as a shared responsibility.  We paid a bitter price in late Fall/Winter with a dreadful resurgence, saved by the vaccine (a true medical miracle for the US).  Trump continued to rail away, and our social media (especially Facebook) Fall spread doubt and discord - helping Trump spread lies and discord.

you better believe that every Republican would be fully vaccinated with the “trump vaccine”, and that many liberals would rail against the “rushed” vaccine. i remember reading nytimes comments last fall, saying “i’ll never take this vaccine if the trump administration is the one approving it”.

Why is it impossible to understand a Republican can believe in the vaccine and a Democrat not?"
2021-09-22 00:03:54,I think Ross raises an interesting point here that is worth considering but I think he is placing too much weight on a review from the London Review of Books.  To say that that one pre-Covid book review articulated “a core left perspective — that stringent public health responses are inherently authoritarian and inevitably ratify various forms of inequality and social control” is definitely an overstatement.  Ultimately that is one historian’s perspective that the publication decided to run.  Given the importance liberalism has been placing in science recently - for good reason I might add - I’m not sure how representative this historian’s take on the Florence pandemic is with liberals at large.

Masks are a sign of respect for the world as it is not as I want it to be. What happened to ”I don’t know” and ”maybe you are right” and ”relax’? Put the mask on, keep your distance and be with each other. Cut the rants. I know. I am preaching to an empty church or assembly hall or…….I am tired of the discussion.

He is engaging in ever-more ridiculous 'hypotheticals' about what if the democrats and not the Republicans had been anti-science, anti-vaxx, pro-death. Sorry, but that's just not the way it played out, and for one simple reason: the talking heads on the right have been dismissing the importance of science and experts for decades. So it's really no surprise that the sheer idiocy is all centered on one side when it comes to ignoring science and vaccines. Douthat could well turn himself into a pretzel before acknowledging that he's simply part of a death cult now."

How about we look back just about 30 or 40 years, when many governments of all stripes mandated proof of multiple vaccinations for entry to their country. I know this was the case because I lived it. Governments ranging from liberal democracies to military dictatorships had almost identical policies. Why? Because it was in their interest to not have people get sick and die of preventable diseases. And this view was widely regarded as common sense, and widely accepted.

It still is in many, many places, but not in today's Republican party. Because it has bought into massive misinformation.

The equivalence you try so hard to generate simply isn't there."
2021-09-22 00:18:54,"Refusal of the Covid Vaccination will be a scene in the next 'Dumb and Dumber' movie.
I'v spoken with a number of anti-vaccination people and they all lack the ability to reason. It's a total waste of time. Their cognitive dissonance kicks in and they are gone."
2021-09-22 00:19:13,"You are assuming there is a left wing and a right wing in the behavioral responses to a pandemic.  There are better explanations that don't require mapping attitudes and acts against a left/right matrix.

If you do not believe in an afterlife, you are more likely to take care of yourself in this life.  If you do believe, then you can diss science and let God decide your fate.  

If you are educated and seek the best knowledge about immunity, vaccination, plagues, history, and expertise, then
you will get the vaccine and be pro-plague restrictions.

If you are older and more vulnerable to the virus (and wiser),
you will imitate the Sanita.

I just find left/right mapping both reductive and tiring."
2021-09-22 00:27:44,"I always thought of Foucault and others who explore biopolitics as being more descriptive than prescriptive, and to me, knowledge of how biopolitics is part and parcel of modern capitalism makes one more clear-eyed with respect to mandates and other measures. This explains the frankly ignorant response of some on the right who feel that Covid-protection measures are an extraordinary imposition of government control. The rest of us know that there's really nothing extraordinary about them. Capitalist power structures monitor us from birth to death; that's just the way it is. In the current case, mandates can save our lives (and economies). In others, biopolitical power can lead to grave injustice. It's up to those of us who understand the issue to act in the proper ways given the particular situation. What's pathetic are the words and actions of conservatives who extol the supposed virtues of capitalism yet object to this particular biopolitical intervention, an intervention of a type that would not exist had the modern capitalist state not developed in the first place."
2021-09-22 00:27:56,"Our government isn't supposed to mandate masks or vaccines, which would keep the majority of us safe and healthy, and allow us to get a grip on the virus' spread and mutations,  but it's ok for the government to accept that every citizen can carry an arsenal of assault weapons into a grocery store or school and to shoot dozens of people with those weapons.  And it's ok for a governmental body to mandate that women carry a bundle of cells in her uterus for 9 months to pop out another human which will probably not be wanted and may not be cared for. 

The entire Republican party is so beyond reasonable or rational that it's turning America into something that the great American Fascist, the last POTUS, called other countries. 

I find the quality of life in America very very low for so many of us right now and that's because of the increasingly psychopathic Republican party, for whom insatiable lust for money, power and complete control of others by way of threat, denial of basic human rights and violence is an every day, common  American occurrence."
2021-09-22 00:28:27,"Can the Times stop paying for this stuff?

Douthat takes a book reviewer as representative of the entire left so therefore all the must must be anti-lockdown.  

But from the very beginning the right adopted anti-science positions and the left tried to use common sense about a changing situation.  I don't expert the experts to be perfect and I take whatever they say with a pinch of salt."
2021-09-22 00:32:56,"I think this argument overlooks the way in which the left has historically been associated with solidarity and a degree of communitarianism, while the right with individualism and freedom. Viewed through this lens, there hasn't been much of an ideological 'flip' at all."
2021-09-22 00:34:05,"The best part of this piece was the author saying it would be his last on the subject. 
What a waste of space!!  
A good column should make a point, follow with facts and wind up making a clear case for that point.
Ross, in his typical manner, tries the high brow route and goes in circles.
Why does the NYT keep publishing him?  Yes he’s a conservative, but surely there is someone of that ilk who can write an entertaining, sensible, and understandable piece on occasion."
2021-09-22 00:37:47,"I’m not sure that it’s COVID only that has spurred what seems at first to be a conservative-liberal flip. Yes, conservatives now use previously leftist anti-authoritarian rhetoric. You know, all those Nazi evocations and claims that the system is oppressing them. But they seem to reserve this stance only for what they perceive to be the liberal establishment, especially when the Dems are in the majority. Otherwise, I think they are fine with authoritarians, especially of the religious type."
2021-09-22 00:41:40,"I don't understand your need to assign political categories.

1,800+ Americans are dying daily, and hospitals in the worst regions can no longer function.

This pandemic has been going on for 2 years, we have effective vaccines, and we all know the best path forward to mitigate the damage.

Instead of citing 17th century Italian prostitutes. Talk to any nurse working in the South-East, and ask them how they feel about mask and vaccine mandates."
2021-09-22 00:45:39,"I really would prefer never to have to mention the man's name again. However, on this question, his influence cannot be overstated. Trump knew at least in January 2020, 10 months away from his re-election bid, what was headed our way. He told Bob Woodward as much. Yet he continued to lie for months -- ""It’s going to disappear"" -- until he could lie no longer and have any hope of duping swing voters and winning re-election. Then he appeared on TV daily for hours pretending to be an expert until he suggested bleach injections as a possible cure, and, ""like a miracle,"" he disappeared from the show.

There's nothing inherently political about sincere efforts to save lives in the midst of a pandemic. There's nothing political about requiring citizens to be vaccinated against highly communicable, deadly diseases; we've been doing that since before our founding.

What was political was Trump gambling with our lives out of fear that treating the virus with the seriousness it warranted could upset the financial markets and consequently his political future.

Sadly, Trump and the conservatives are still gambling with our lives in the hope they can paint Biden as the power-hungry despot wielding our virus fears as an instrument of control. Also sadly, you're prattling on about a 17th-century Italian epidemic and a supposed ""flip"" in our political ideologies offers little enlightenment and much credence to your conservative friends who have been wrong every step of the way."
2021-09-22 00:53:35,"Ross, seems like you have been trying to argue in your last few columns that there is nothing inherent in the current American conservative ideology that would indicate trivializing Covid and life-saving science based measures to respond to the pandemic.  I don’t think you have made your case.  All you have to do is look at what actually happened and how people actually reacted.  Your counterfactuals bear no weight because they are not reality.  You should ask deeper questions like why did Trump choose to downplay Covid and not support science based pandemic measures.  My answer is that he knew his base wouldn’t support it if he did.  This is not just a theory; it is backed by contemporaneous news accounts.  Doesn’t that severely undermine your position?"
2021-09-22 00:55:59,"I am a doctor who treats Covid patients. I don’t think the current political divide on Covid is related to Donald Trump. Doctors and scientists really don’t pay that much attention to Trump. We make decisions mainly on the scientific evidence. 

The Democratic Party has become the party of the technocratic elite, who tend to have this same understanding of and respect for the scientific method. The Republican Party has tended to attract people who don’t think this way, and make their decisions based more on relationships and gut feelings. I’m not sure why this epistemological divide has occurred, but that’s what it looks like from here. 

It’s not about intelligence. It’s about respect for the scientific method."
2021-09-22 00:55:40,"I think you might be reading too much into one article written by a leftie about a long-ago plague. It seems like it was romanticizing a couple of teenagers freedom besides and not a statement of policy for our times. There's a much larger pattern you failed to click into: climate change denial, evolution denial, covid denial. It's not just the same party but largely the same people within that party. You know who I'm talking about and they're not your Catholic relatives."
2021-09-22 00:58:06,"Maybe the left is more practical than ideological?  

Maybe the left sees stay-at-home orders as a response to an exceptional situation that is not applicable beyond the boundaries of the crisis — so not authoritarian, just humanitarian."

2021-09-22 01:03:18,"Political theory often ties to political economy, centered on an agreed thing of value (e.g., money, labor), but the pandemic response also requires leveraging public goods, prosocial behavior, and risk communication principles.  With no common reference points and ways to manage new concepts, society went through the motions: we had chiefs of hospital emergency departments opining on things they are not expert in (at all), we had people wearing face shields to block aerosols, etc.   Individual responses were about tolerance of risk and also tolerance of change; sometimes these can gauge political thinking, but sometimes not.  With limited info, people latched onto a person, or an idea, or a process, or a party.  Much more social science work (especially data) is needed to explore the phenomenon talked about in the article."
2021-09-22 01:16:03,"I quite like how Ross uses the historical analogy to frame his story about Covid and the left/right issue along with his own changes in thinking. 

On Ross own thinking I feel Ross fails to account for how Covid and the pandemic has altered his own mental state and his ability to process what the pandemic has created. He is not alone but we all need to be much more careful about how we explain our reactions to the pandemic when mental health is so fragile in these times

I have read at least one of his other articles on what is left and right and how the thinking of these groups can change. But I end up feeling he is creating fake news which I do not find convincing in these missives."

2021-09-22 01:13:38,"One side is fighting the pandemic—and desperately wants it to be over. The other side, still fuming over their 2020 election loss and the role they believe COVID played in it, is preoccupied with fighting liberals. That about sums it up."
2021-09-22 01:14:04,"Odd that I saw you and your family at Mass this Sunday, outdoor Mass so masks not required. However, the rector did ask us wear masks as we approach for communion, which you didn't do, even through you had masks in your pocket and stroller. Obviously you did not respect the celebrant enough to comply with his simple request. Weird indeed."
2021-09-22 00:51:16,"Brilliant, Ross. I've noticed this political reversal as well. And if the comments are any indication, you know you're on to something when you hit a collective nerve."
2021-09-22 01:36:18,Best opinion piece I have read in a very long. Will definitely share with my liberal and conservative friends alike.
2021-09-22 01:39:01,"I agree with Douthat that as Covid time drags on, attaining some sense of normalcy and community becomes a bigger priority. It's one thing to sacrifice for a short duration of time (or at least a measurable duration of time), but it's quite another to make those sacrifices interminably. The irony is that the people who are making Covid interminable are the very people who have been unwilling to make any concessions to the pandemic, even when it was raging. I'm finding myself rebelling against my own better judgment on Covid because it's dragged on so long. We've all been put in this position by the people who never took Covid seriously in the first place. They're winning."
2021-09-22 01:45:30,"I’ve been in a year long dialog with a Republican friend who refuses to be vaccinated.  I’ve tried hard to understand her position.  She keeps citing bullying and censorship and lies. Nothing factual helps.  But I think I finally nailed her today.  I said:  “I think what’s really going on is that you are being played by certain forces on the right whose political agenda is to foment distrust of the government, of media, of Big Pharma, of Big Tech, of whatever and whomever they think is keeping them from achieving their goals.  Those goals do not include protecting your health.  They don’t care about that. “"
2021-09-22 01:49:52,"The left certainly acknowledged the authoritarian nature of such controls and their tendency to exacerbate inequities. That’s why we also consistently supported financial and legal supports for those most affected by constraints for which they bore no responsibility. Initially, republicans were on board with some of these actions but, just as with the disease itself, they quickly reverted to a party line that has cost lives and livelihoods in the name of some puritanical libertarian ideal that would see masses of homeless unemployed and the overflowing hospitals and triage of republican managed states imposed nationwide."
2021-09-22 01:54:39,"I'm surprised that Ross doesn't acknowledge the role of religion. Restrictions on worship were one of the earliest flashpoints in the shutdown. At this point, the religious right plays a much larger role in Republican thinking than traditional conservative political thought does."
2021-09-22 02:03:26,"Ross Douthat's premise is that, before the pandemic struck, liberals were solidly in the libertarian scofflaw camp is essentially unsupported here. One book review does not make for a competent argument. What is verifiably true is that the Trump McConnell Republicans had already, before the pandemic struck, become a personality cult which would do anything in the name of power including getting more than half a million of us needlessly dead. They would have swung toward whichever direction they believed pointed to power. And it wouldn't have mattered how many people needlessly died."
2021-09-22 02:11:56,"Ross. Absolutely Flawless.

I am obsessively Left in your description, but also inquisitive enough to try to understand ""the other side"".

I personally appreciate your absolute lack of a ""line in the sand"" mentality.

This thing, this Pandemic, has caused confusion amongst all of us. To be clear, I give zero room to the politics of the Right in relation to the Pandemic. But the common person can suffer from whiplash because of the media's coverage.

Good on you, Ross.
Well said, even if I had to read it through three times..."
2021-09-22 02:15:08,"Many of these comments claim that the Left rigorously follows the science; Perhaps, but what about the widespread minimization of covid concerns in the midst of the George Floyd protests? 

I deplore the covid denialism on the Trumpian right. It was deeply irresponsible and has caused many unnecessary deaths. But Douthat does correctly diagnose a kind of inverted Trumpism on the Left, which now seems to deny that there is anything called an acceptable risk. 

How else can you explain people driving around alone, in their Toyota Priuses, wearing masks?"

2021-09-22 01:43:18,"Washing my hands for 20 seconds, wearing a mask, and getting a shot are such minor things! No one is getting thrown into prison for not doing such things--the penalties are a drawn-out pandemic and a lot of death.

I simply don't understand why the right is freaking out over something so ordinary. Washing my hands a little longer than I already did? 

Wearing a mask that's no more constricting than the scarf I wore over my mouth and nose to walk in a blizzard or the bandana that I pulled up when gardening or the dust mask that I wore when cleaning a basement? 

Getting a shot in my arm when I've received many shots over the years--including a time when I got one shot a week to reduce my allergy to bee stings?

Reminding people of common sense health protocols and trying to help them stay alive is not like a draft for a war of choice or the permanent imposition of airport security theater.

All the COVID measures will end when the pandemic dies out. The quarantines and masks worn during plague times and the Spanish flu were all put aside when disease abated.

If your friend suggests that you stay home with a cold rather than go to a party and sneeze all over your other friends, that doesn't make them a tyrant.

Why don't more people realize that a human-transmitted virus can't survive unless we enable it?

This is not a right / left flip. It's the right's continuing rejection of science and critical thought."

2021-09-22 02:04:06,"When people get into arguments, they often blow up over something trivial—like a towel dropped on a bathroom floor.

The minor issue becomes a way to try to address something major and more complex—perhaps that a relationship is collapsing because two people have nothing in common.

COVID measures are a convenient excuse. Mask wearing is a towel on the floor. Something the right can use as a way to vent their frustration over not getting to impose a 1950’s “Leave It To Beaver” patriarchy on the rest of the nation."
2021-09-22 02:14:13,"I acknowledge that former President Donald Trump has happened, the trashy nouveau riche bum of my time in NYC during the Seventies. And Trump has shown much of the GOP that it pays (in votes, money, power) to lie, to divide, to polarize, to target others, to stomp on the legitimacy of elections and the founding principles of this country for a cheap win.  

Yeah, De Santis doesn't trust Trump and Trump hates De Santis, but Trump taught De Santis every single trick he is using right now.  Just keep lying and staring everybody down.  Show that you have more chutzpah than everyone and go on FOX to prove it.

Covid backed Trump into a corner and he hit back harder, just like he says he does.  Trump thought he could take Covid hostage, but it didn't work.  So he took the country hostage instead.  Nothing but covid and election fraud lies, over and over again.

That's what I acknowledge."

Yes, we are All Confused! How could it be otherwise?"
2021-09-22 01:39:43,"I think Ross has a point. Pre-Covid, the most liberal California counties were the least vaccinated. We got warnings from our local school district that we needed to look for symptoms of diseases like measles and whooping cough I had thought long eradicated. There is a whoo-whoo left that is just as anti-science as the Trumpy right."
2021-09-22 01:40:01,"Oh please. The right is the one singing and dancing about the left being elitist. It is their song of victimhood. It has nothing to do with reality but be a political meme to keep the tribe together.

And the left should be empowered, if there was one vote per person. However the game is still rigged in favor of the minority right."
2021-09-22 01:45:18,"This writer's thought processes are hard to accept. It's not an issue of right and left. It's an issue of science (pro-Sanita) and science denial (anti-Sanita). Even in the face of effective, free and convenient covid vaccines, the anti-science stance of people like Greg Abbott, Ron DeSantis, Tate Reeves or Kristi Noem persists. It harms not just their states but all people in the US, so an analogy to a city like Florence are not particularly apt. Douthat is turning himself into a logical pretzel to try to excuse some of these science deniers, and is unconvincingly attempting to falsely tar the left with that description. This is called projection. 

Parenthetically, the London Review of Books has a circulation of about 76,000. The Economist, in contrast has a circulation of ca. 869,000 in North America and 1.66 million worldwide. The NYT has 5.1 million digital subscribers, adding some 1.7 million of them in 2020 alone. I wouldn't view the opinion of one person scavenged from the London Review of Books as representative of the thoughts of the political left."
2021-09-22 01:51:52,"This is not a very useful analysis. Douthat appears to be unable to write about anything independently of his reductive dualism, and his over-riding need to misrepresent and apportion blame to what he claims to be the left, as he exculpates the right.

It would be good to be able to see what Douthat might come up with if he could, however briefly, think beyond this limiting  obsession with scoring points, and consider the thing itself."
2021-09-26 10:31:11,"I’ve paid $365 for a PCR test with 24-hour results in San Francisco, twice.  It was expensive, sure — but it was a requirement for international travel and I guess that’s what the market will bear.  Same thing in Berlin was 120 EUR, in Bangkok 2700 Baht… which I would call equivalent prices given who travels where.  I think the bigger question is not how much I’m gouged but how much better everything would work if we had abundant fast cheap testing."

Healthcare inequity in the country is appalling but people are still going to mindlessly scream about socialism when any effort is made to improve the system.

Boston University, where I work, built its own testing facility at the beginning of the pandemic to be able to keep its community of 36,000 safe with weekly or more frequent testing. Why? Because the labs were charging $120 —the approved Medicaid rate— for what we learned could be a $15 test. Question should be why is $120 the approved reimbursement rate when this does not reflect the cost of the service."
2021-09-26 12:11:34,"Why are people not just paying the $20 and getting the at-home test? 

I’d suggest that’s because it’s $20 out of pocket, which is almost triple the federal minimum wage. And remember too that enhanced unemployment benefits are over.

GS Lab is taking advantage to make a quick profit on a tragic situation. I have no great love for insurance companies, I think they perpetuate a broken healthcare system here in the US, but I don’t think this is what Congress intended."

A good profit was built into each test. This was not covered by their universal and excellent healthcare system (even though my wife and kids are duals) because it was for travel. Fair enough.

Pharmacies in our area have a ridiculously cumbersome screening and sign up process and never have appointments available, but GS Labs was able to run rapid/PCR/anitibody on him next day with results from the rapids within an hour.  As far as I'm concerned they should charge what they want - they are providing a much needed service.  Until we can get it together and provide low cost effective testing and make it available to all (i.e. like every European country I read about) I'm fine with insurance companies picking up the tab.  This lack of coordination and infighting rather than working together is just another example as why we can't get over the hump with this pandemic."
2021-09-26 13:07:23,"In Mexico, prices range from 500 pesos if you are planning in advance and can arrange to get to the specific location where the test is offered cheapest, up to 1000 pesos if you need to be tested at a hospital or the airport. That's somewhere between $25 USD and $50 USD.

It takes a human less than an hour of work, so even if we presume that Mexican labor is free and COVID testers in the States should make 200,000 per year for their courage in swabbing cheeks the test shouldn't cost more than around $150.

I hope the Courts have the courage to set a precedent that Congress cannot pass a law that forces people to pay inflated prices, and that if a law looks that way, that part of the law is and should be unenforceable. It's not the first, and likely won't be the last time that Congress passes such sloppy and poorly considered laws."

The only surprising thing about City   Ventures “GS Labs” is who they are gouging. Usually it’s the patient without insurance that pays the inflated price, this time because of the way the law is written it’s the insurance company themselves that are being played. The price disparities are rarely about quality of care or testing and mostly about what you can get away with in any given situation. There’s a reason that one finds the same financial predators in “real estate and investment” now deeply involved in every aspect of the health care “game” and it ain’t “public welfare”. You remember that prominent Democratic politician whose daughter was responsible for the inflated price of asthma rescue inhalers? And then the discount and coupon gimmicks they offered after their scam was reported on? The entire industry is like that, hedge funds, private equity and Wall Street are now deeply entwined throughout health care and manipulating everything for fun and profit including pandemic response and resources. There’s profit to be made from human misery and the devil take the hindmost."

As Ms. Kliff correctly notes, ""GS Labs’s high prices and growing presence — it has performed a half-million rapid tests since the pandemic’s start, and still runs thousands daily — show how the government’s longstanding reluctance to play a role in health prices has hampered its attempt to protect consumers.""

The ""reluctance"" of our representatives in BOTH the Republican and Democrat parties to ""play a role in health prices""--i.e., to protect us from such predatory moves as those of GS Labs and their ilk--is bought and paid for by America's corrupt campaign finance rules and Citizen's United.

The Luminex Aries wham-bam single cartridge PCR test these guys offer isn't that much more difficult to setup (think your Keurig coffee machine). Most of what you or insurance company is paying is profit for the company. Now, there are very clever tests, designed to simplify prep (skipping RNA purification step), reduce the cost down to a few bucks and use saliva instead of nasal swabs - let's hear it for covidSHIELD from University of Illinois.

My insurer's website doesn't make clear if they cover testing for travel. I suspect not, but if I assume yes, I could end up with a surprise bill. With testing required within 3 days of arrival, you really need results within 2 1/2 days of departure. PCR tests don't usually guarantee this, and rapid antigen tests seem to be harder to find around where I live (the nearest CVS site with appointments available is over an hour away). My county has a testing site, with only an online signup form that requests health and insurance info. I suspect this may not be for travel, but there's no phone number to call to ask.

My response is to explain that it is neither the “greatest” (based on outcomes vs the rest of the world, though maybe the greatest based on cost), nor is it a true free market system. In the US system insurance companies, rather than the government, determine what medications and services will and will not be covered.  Additionally, a “free market” approach to healthcare would allow a free exchange of information so consumers can make informed buying decisions, but try deciding which facility to have a covered procedure done at based on your final out of pocket expense - impossible since you only know this figure for certain after having the procedure and being billed, and costs for the same procedure will vary greatly from facilities even ones in the same city. On the other hand, the CARES Act approach to COVID testing and the GS pricing model does seem to result in a free market approach to healthcare: consumers get to go wherever they want for a procedure (test); providers (GS Labs) get to charge whatever the market will bare ($380 seems fair for a $20 test); and insurers are on the hook for it all.

My children had been back in school, but his exposure kept them home again.  We had to follow school policy and isolate the kids at home away from their dad for X days and then get two tests after X number of days at least 24 hours apart in order for them to return to classes.  That meant that test number 2 fell on a Sunday.  Not wanting to keep them out of classes any longer than necessary, I looked and at the time, GS labs was the only testing option I could find on Sundays.  It was convenient enough but felt sketchy compared to the city run sites open Mon-Sat.  I pulled into an empty parking lot downtown and within one hour we had a result and kids were back in school on Monday.  Fast forward to this summer and I got an EOB for more than $800 for the two tests.  I panicked and looked online and found a government press release saying patients wouldn't have to pay this type of COVID related cost.  At that point I was livid.  I spent time on the phone with a customer service rep from my insurance and leaving messages for GS labs.  I feel like we were manipulated by both GS labs and our insurer, Premera.  As far as I know, this is still unresolved.  P.S. I'm still frustrated/irritated/exasperated with the coworker who exposed us and started that whole roller coaster as well."

The fact that this outfit is owned by an investment firm tells you all you need to know. When private equity and for-profit entities beholden to shareholders get involved in healthcare, price gouging and unethical tactics inevitably follow. 

Government can help consumers here: publish  accessible billing guides with common CPT codes and questions to ask your insurer and the testing facility BEFORE you get tested. While not everyone has the time and sophistication to interface with healthcare in this way, those of us with chronic illnesses and complex needs know that this billing legwork is often necessary in the system we have, no matter how “good” your insurance is (or claims to be). Few casual healthcare users may understand that you should always choose an in-network testing facility if you have the option. The insurers are correct: this out of network testing will unnecessarily drive up premiums.

The FAA should also get their act together for ALL airlines to require THE SAME tests to board and they should be, at the very least, their own testing category at any and all facilities and pharmacies at a set price. Set up rapid testing sites at all major airports, all for the same tests and airlines should have some skin in the game to get it done.

2021-09-26 17:07:30,"The problem is that patients reasonably assume their insurance will cover it, because of the outrageous premiums they pay, but the insurance doesn't actually cover it.

The insurance doesn't cover it because GS labs charges outrageous prices to the insurance companies - far more than than the up front cash price - and this pricing is completely opaque to the patient until the insurance company refuses to pay and the patient receives the inflated bill. 

At the very least , in the case of medical service priced above the medicare cost rate,the patient should be presented both online and at the checkin desk, with the price the patient will end up being billed for, so that they can make a choice. 

The law wouldn't be that hard - before service the patient is either given a bill or required to prepay the difference of the medicare cost- and that cost is written in stone with no after billing. 

Whether or not above-medicare costs should be allowed at all - that is another issue.  On the one hand the option for premium service is useful to some.  On the other hand in geographic situations where there is no competition it will only lead to gouging.  Still, the two issues should be logically decoupled in discussion - (1) up front pricing, (2) maximum pricing limits.  The de facto result of current congressiional legislation is that there are no (2) maximum pricing limits, AND no (1) up front pricing, Which is just a faux capitalist scam."

I simply do not understand fees like $380, or $400 (that Gabcaz mentions below). 

Certainly CVS, and the lab they use, makes some money on testing (they're a store - they have to make at least some money on everything they sell - that what stores do). But $139 sounds quite reasonable. 

A lot goes into testing that we don't see. The machines needed to test are expensive. The process of testing isn't that difficult, but it's also not something people can do without training. Tracking the tests and results takes more than an Excel spreadsheet. Testing for one person would be easy - doing tens or (as a chain) hundreds of thousands of tests a month with accuracy takes real technology. 

The people and companies that do testing for us with precision deserve to make a living. They process huge numbers of tests and the entire system needs to be error free (pretty sure no one would want to mistakenly get someone else's results).

But how is it possible that CVS can charge $139 and still make money, and this company charges $380? I don't see how they can even try to justify it with a straight face.

It is just flat out, full bore price-gouging of the worst kind.

And the ceo’s and boards of private healthcare, biotech, and medical device firms are laughing all the way to the bank as they leverage government funded research on the upstream side, and bailouts if they happen to extract too much in bonuses and dividends.

The soonest screening appointment available was a week out and ultimately cancelled by the clinic saying someone would call to reschedule.  They never called.

The hypocrisy is boundless - just watch the Pharm ads arguing against allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices! Reminiscent of the Harry and Louise ads that the insurance lobby launched decades ago with great success. How can any person with a functioning brain believe Pharm is a victim? Those who do, should be reminded that we pay many times more for the same drugs here than any other western democracy - and fir this price we receive the worst care, the worst outcomes and pay the highest prices! The Kleptocracy Trifecta. Our country must oversee a major revision to our healthcare policies: we don’t have to reinvent the wheel, just institute the model of Switzerland which no one can argue isn’t a bastion of capitalism - or Israel, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and the rest.

One agent told me she saw a bill for $17,000 for a Covid test.
￼It’s not that I can’t afford the remainder but neither agreed that they are responsible to deal with each other. They both felt it was the other agents issue. They both blamed each other for being greedy￼.

And because we want to encourage people to get tested. Because when they get tested they are actually doing a PUBLIC service to the whole community, not only protecting themselves.
Of course the test still costs - the nurse doing it still has to be paid.
That pay will come from those awful, dreadful, socialistic TAXES that we as a community pay to fund our PUBLIC health service.
Only in the USA. ..."

Somewhere along the pay-chain, I had been classified as uninsured. The test: $310. With a $30. Punishment fee (they call it an uninsured fee) from NYS.



The insurance should pay it but lo to any uninsured people out there."

2021-09-26 20:55:58,"This is just more evidence of the decline of the American nation, which I believe is irreversible.   How does a civilized society tolerate this type of price gouging?  Friends returning from Europe report that instant testing is available everywhere for just a few euro."
2021-09-26 21:09:12,"How many more examples of abuse by bad actors in the healthcare industry do we need to see before we say enough.  It is outrageous to see time and time again  how so many can expect to extract so much wealth off of the health care of Americans.  If is just so fundamentally wrong on so many levels and  yet it continues year in and year out. It just does not work.  It is a system that is totally broken  and is in desperate need of a complete rebuild.
This is what happens when everything in your country is for sale to the highest bidder and where greed is the prime mover of all things.  It is long since time for a single payer system that is completely dominant throughout the rest of the industrial world to come to the US."

There was a COVID positive in my child’s daycare earlier this week, both started to have a dry cough over the weekend, and my husband and I work full-time. We need to know their results today so we can arrange properly for work & caregiving this week.
I looked high and low for an alternative testing option yesterday and this morning and… nothing. Especially for the under 4 set. Especially on a weekend.
We have insurance and an HSA… we are the lucky ones. But this is ridiculous."

2021-09-26 22:20:58,It's the same for medications for Medicare. Our government can't negotiate lower prices for medications.The only industrialized country in the world that allows its citizens to be bilked by the private pharmaceutical industry. another failure of allowing political campaign contributions.
2021-09-27 01:05:53,"The lab is conducting so
Many tests means people are going there in-spite of knowing the price. Maybe the government should prevent people from getting tested there."
2021-09-27 01:44:36,I had a lab take my insurance for a PCR test with results in about an hour and then I found out from my explanation of benefits that they billed my insurance almost $2000. That was negotiated down via some special rate they had to about $750. I subsequently found out that had I had no insurance or had I not decided to use it the charge would have been $249.   That is almost reasonable for 1-2hr results of a PCR test.  But clearly most people with insurance will choose the zero out of pocket amount - and they certainly did not make the difference obvious at all.  Total highway robbery and taking advantage even more than what is quoted in the article.

I got two tests done at the private ptoviders just to make sure that I get back the results on time incase if one provider fails for some reason. At one place I paid Rs 900 (~$12), and at another Rs 600 (~$8).

There is no reason to pay $380 for the same tests in the US. How long will the US health care consumers be ripped off legally? This corruption I believe goes all thw way up to the US hall of congress where instead of Senators and Congressmen writing the laws, it is written by the corrupt industry lobbyists."
2021-09-26 22:35:56,"It is all to common to read these sort of stories that come out of our dysfunctional health care system.  The unmitigated greed and the ethos of “lets squeeze every nickel and dime out people that we possibly can while people are down”  is staggering and causes great pessimism in human decency.  Examples like “surprise billing”, “out-of-network inflated charges”, “$50k helicopter rides”, “medical providers taking people to court to recover payments beyond what insurance pays” - all these sort of things make you feel like you are just prey to the pack of jackals that make up our healthcare system. Having great fear about the financial implications of getting medical treatment is unacceptable. There has to be a limit and our lawmakers better be in tune with what is happening. No one seems to have the back of the average person/family.  I feel we are all on our own out there.

I say this with great seriousness, given the way things are going and way average people are being preyed upon (with no protective help from our government officials) I think at some point forces will align somehow to cause another revolution to happen in this country - likely violent. Maybe not 5-years from now, but perhaps within 15-20-25 years time. Things cannot keep going this way. How can they pass legislation that references no cost limits? Lawmakers have to know that there are people who will take massive advantage of this oversight."

Paris, France: Many pharmacies will test you right off the street, give you results and a QR code on paper or on your phone for 25 euro in 15 minutes. If I were French, there would be no charge. 
So, please, where is the premium service GS Labs claim they provide? Only in poor United States."

The car repair shop sets the labor rate for services, just like health care providers set their labor rates.  In my lifetime I have seen the labor rate for mechanics double in price.  For-profit insurance gets involved in healthcare and suddenly the providers are told their income, much less than their own fee schedule and less than what a car mechanic charges.  Insurance is the racket, and single payer sounds like heaven."
2021-09-27 05:16:38,"This just shows that medical facilities will cheat and gouge as much as they can if not curtailed. And Congress is in the pockets of the Health care industry who exploit every opportunity to profiteer.

For the last 28 months, the Davis community has been offered weekly testing for free.  With the high number of people being tested, it takes 24 hours to get results.  On dorm move-in day, they tested over 16,000 students.  I think it costs under $20 per test.  This could easily be duplicated.  There is no reason to spend gobs of money on testing."

Because they spend huge amounts of effort on devising ways to squeeze every last cent of profit they can out of it, even it it means getting away with as much cheating as possible, legal or not
Take them completely out of the equation and pass measures to regulate providers and their more outrageous prices and make health care universal.
It’s the only fair way to do it, it’s the only efficient way to do it and it’s the only moral way to do it.  Let’s stop avoiding the inevitable and just do it NOW!"

I'm outraged at GS Labs--I filed a complaint with the state AG after getting my test with them. But it was Sunday, and (surprise!) every Walgreens in the city was out of rapid tests. 

But the real culprit is the federal government. Michael Mina touted rapid tests as part of the solution LAST YEAR. Yet there's still a shortage. Of course this corrupt lab is price gouging."
2021-09-27 07:05:02,"How many times will we have to see profiteering by the health care ""industry"" before our so-called ""representatives"" in Congress do the right thing and take the profit motive out of health care once and for all?"
2021-09-27 09:31:05,"Is there any legal reason why insurance companies can’t simply send letters and emails to their policy holders saying

“If you need a COVID test, please have it performed at your local pharmacy.  The cost should be approximately $20, which we will reimburse in full, plus an additional $10 for your trouble that will be deducted from your next insurance premium.  A simple, easy-to-fill-out claim form may be found on our website.  We encourage all our policy-holders to avail themselves of this offer, as it will help greatly to keep your monthly premiums as low as possible.”

Whatever the insurer might pay in the form of an incentive, it’ll surely be be a small fraction of what they’d have to pay to outfits like GS Labs.

I should think that that would solve the problem."

People resent government regulations but on closer examination most if not all government consumer regulations are there to protect the public from deceptive and/or dangerous practices.  Why is it that the Cares Act had this gigantic loophole that would permit price gouging? Maybe we need to ask the lobbyists who helped write the law. GS should be ashamed of themselves but they are too busy counting their money to feel any shame.
2021-09-27 16:06:09,"Fortunately, we live in a progressive county within a Blue state where PCR testing for Covid can be obtained FREE by appointment, with a rapid turnover (24-48hrs) for results.  The testing is especially useful for those about to embark upon international travel, which requires negative results no greater than 72hrs post-test.  Also, no doctor’s referral is required, only just driving up with mask on until swab is taken.  We even had our out-of-state friends use the test facility before they drove into Canada, and they were ever so grateful of the speed and convenience.

And insurers calling it out seems particularly duplicitous considering they routinely charge Americans $1000 for a pill that would cost a European $14 - all because they pay politicians of both stripes millions of dollars in bribes to keep it that way.

One man's ""price-gouging"" is another man's ""profit motive""."
2021-09-26 20:47:09,This is an example of the healthcare system is almost cannibalistic in their practises. Allow Indian labs to set up collection centres in the USA and tests will cost less than $10 for an RTPCR. Indian lans can collect samples a major airports and have them fly out on planes to India for testing. Then the American people will have low cos reliable testing
2021-09-26 20:54:14,￼ I don’t understand why testing in the United States is so complicated and so expensive. Testing in Germany has been free to the public the entire time. In 15 minutes you have a PCR test result. You can buy a rapid test at the pharmacy for less than two euros. Schools hand out rapid tests twice a week for all students who are not vaccinated to test and ensure that no one is covid positive. I’m so grateful that I left my mom with a bundle of rapid tests when I visited the US this summer￼￼￼￼￼￼￼. Why should anyone have to wait more than half a day for a test result?!￼￼
2021-09-27 20:01:10,The same thing happens with a test lab called Predicine which operates(d) at least one pop-up test site near the Oakland Airport.  I took a test and Predicine mistakenly billed me $165 instead of my insurer.  The bill included something called a medical consultation which was nothing more than a temp worker at the site asking if I had any symptoms.  I later found that Predicine was a cancer test lab which quickly set up its COVID-19 test ability.  These price gouging practices during a pandemic have sickened me to the stomach.
2021-09-27 22:18:21,"There are many free Covid testing sites in my area, which is relatively ex-urban/rural.  In any state, check with the state health department to find where you can get a free test in your area.  Even if you don't have insurance, you should be able to get a free test.  Don't be gouged."
2021-09-27 22:26:38,"In Australia, testing is free.  The jab is free - of any variant.  Fortunately (apart from the vaccine manufacturers)  there's no incentive for private profit from public health challenges."
2021-09-28 00:22:16,"I went to the Rosendale Medical Center Urgent Care for a rapid Covid test--the only place in my area where you could get a walk-in rapid test--and paid $150 for it.  I was told to call back in 4 weeks to see if it would be covered by Medicare.
Everyone there who came for the test was told to pay up front and then could call back to see if it would be covered.
My 4 weeks is nearly up. We'll see if I get any refund."
2021-09-28 01:56:06,"What is the uproar here?  
This lab company is not charging consumers anything. $0.  They are merely negotiating with the insurance companies. The same insurance companies that apparently refused to establish a in-network price with them. 
Is it ""price gouging"" when your X-ray costs $1500 but you pay $0? You can feel bad for the insurance company if you want, but they are the ones that had record profits in 2020.
Does anyone believe your premiums will go down if the insurance company gets a sweet deal?
Kudos to this company that stood up and invested $37 million to provide testing while employing a bunch of people.
Trust me, the insurance companies will be just fine..."
2021-09-25 17:02:17,"With funds in hand from the federal grants, this should not be a problem. The issue is money. The districts need to hire some staff to help kids provide their samples and ensure the lab capability to process them. 

Weekly testing of every student has been in place in our district in Cambridge, Ma since the start of the pandemic with some 4,000 kids being tested weekly in public schools across the district since last spring. 

This is not an insurmountable issue. With the exception of the youngest kids, most kids can do the nose swabs themselves and we do pooled testing to save costs. Of the many impossible problems with Covid, this is not one."
2021-09-25 17:19:37,"The Covid mortality rate for kids is lower than the flu. In Sweden, kids didn't miss any school, aren't forced to wear cloth/paper over their faces, and aren't made to test. They are doing fine. Covid policy for American children is unnecessary  and destructive."
2021-09-25 17:25:45,I’m in middle school and every Monday we get tested.
2021-09-25 17:28:10,"It’s not only money.  It’s sufficient staffing and adequate time. it’s obtaining the tests, scheduling the tests, getting the results, and then contact-tracing if a student tests positive.  And then there’s the patch quilt of school districts - some have mask mandates, others don’t; some test; others don’t.

There are a lot of moving pieces that need to properly fall into place for Covid testing to achieve it’s objectives of keeping students safe and in class, as well as protecting those they interact with."
2021-09-25 17:37:40,"Schools are struggling because, in far too many places,local and state officials have abdicated their responsibilities because they are afraid of being attacked by the loud, angry, and threatening mob and then voted out office or hamstrung by GOP officials knowingly perpetuating the narrative of madness that has gripped our nation. This has thrown local school boards, teachers, and administrators to the wolves - and the wolves are pouncing. They are taking over board meetings, furious about masks and CRT that isn’t even being taught. They are filing thousands of complaints about beloved books. They are slashing tax levies and funding. They are destroying our schools in the name of personal freedom.

I’m telling you, if you want order restored in this nation, if you want to save our public schools and services, then you better stand up, speak out, and be prepared for battle. Too many rational people are sitting silently while the cult of ignorance rolls over our nation, swallowing everything in its path. Get vocal, folks. Start today."
2021-09-25 17:46:30,"Biden allocated billions of dollars to increase school testing, on top of three huge, unprecedented federal aid packages to help schools since the beginning of the pandemic. It's shameful that districts haven't figured this out by now."
2021-09-25 17:51:30,"It is actually astounding that Public Education, a massive undertaking in the best of times, has been saddled with even more demands and expectations thrust upon it by communities, politicians, media, and others not in the trenches… and it manages to cope. Perhaps not with perfection but that is to be expected. 

But that public education takes on (willingly or by edict) more and more of society’s work outside of education, without adequate funding or resources, and still moves forward is testament to the dedicated people who work in this field.

Here we are, once again, with non-educators demanding that the schools not only educate our children but also take on other essential roles: provide daycare so parents can go to work; take care of the mental/emotional health of students; and now provide healthcare as well. And more. 

Yet so many sit on the sidelines and cluck their tongues and wag their fingers, complaining endlessly that it’s not done correctly, it’s too much AND not enough, etc… 

Here’s to the dedicated, passionate, hard working, giving people who work in public education! You deserve an unqualified and rousing cheer (and much more!) for all you do each day!"
2021-09-25 18:44:17,"Let us all take a moment to thank Ciara Brown, a commonsensical and considerate spokeswoman for public health. There are many others like her, but still not enough."
2021-09-25 19:20:51,"Ideally surveillance testing is based on rapid antigen testing to detect infectious cases and isolate them out of school quickly.  That’s it. Clinical testing with PCR for diagnostic confirmation can be done outside of school. Our schools offer PCR testing 3 times a week, during school hours. Who is going to use this voluntary service and miss school? Only people who are already qurantined and missing school anyway. In the meantime families are rapid testing at home, not disclosing their positive test results, and sending their potentially infectious infected kids to school anyway. We need a national standard for testing in schools, to optimize the public health goals for testing and to promote children’s ability to stay in school sustainably, to learn."
2021-09-25 19:38:26,"One group is profiting handsomely from all of this: the Covid testing industry.  The money doesn't seem to be having much practical effect on the ground.  And  I'm not sure relentless testing would make a difference even if America's schools were better coordinated and staffed.    

We need to focus on developing a simple treatment for those who get Covid, an antibody in pill form."
2021-09-25 20:00:03,"Do we need covid testing for schools?

Just follow the Department of Homeland Security compassionate model.

Kids come to school, let them in.  Just like thousands of immigrants come to the US.  Before the policy was to detain them in wait of immigration hearings.  Under the current President the policy is to let them in the US.  Maybe they'll appear before judges, maybe they'll just fade into the shadows.  But no covid tests."
2021-09-25 20:27:20,"Having been there as a teacher and a school board member, I'd be surprised if our school systems accomplish 50% of what is needed to return to normalcy. Our public schools are an anachronistic bureaucratic organization that must deal with a massive top loaded administrative component, staff seniority and tenure requirements which ensures the cream rarely rises to top and governed by a school board where most members have little to no knowledge or experience in education.

It is very sad, watching the multitude of parents storming school board meetings and picketing schools, advocating against mask mandates. If only these parents displayed such vigor and passion in advocating for a better education for their children.

At best, public education is mediocre, at worst, it is an oxymoron. The full impact of Covid, with respect education, will be felt for many years to come. I cannot imagine what an enormous task it will be to make up for all dislocation and the time lost for our children to achieve their educational goals in their path to a fuller and brighter life that good education affords them.  

To undo the damage done over what will probably be almost two years of lost time in our children’s most formidable years, we will need no less than a government program along the lines of the Manhattan Project that led to the development of the atomic bomb, or the Apollo program that put a man on the moon, to return to some form of normalcy in our schools."
2021-09-25 21:05:41,"It hasn’t hit the news cycles yet, but nationwide the current wave has peaked and the daily case counts are dropping like a rock."

2021-09-25 21:24:34,Most testing is not informative beyond the day of the test. It is a waste of resources. Mandate masks and validate vaccines. The rest is a gimmick and benefits only the ludicrous testing companies.
2021-09-25 22:02:37,"What parent would give consent for their child to be tested by some ‘technician’ and run the risk of having their asymptomatic child isolate for ten days? Who would do this? The testing companies stand to gain much while leaning on school nurse and school staff to organize this farce. 
We have not even had a POTENTIAL case of in school transmission this year. Quarantining is unbelievably disruptive. We have more than adequate available testing and CT has nearly the highest vax rate in the US.
Wear masks, vax if you are eligible, stay home and get tested if ill."
2021-09-25 22:41:24,"Mandate students, teachers and staff get vaccinated to come in the building. Then COVID will not be an issue. As a high school teacher I find it unacceptable that students are allowed to enter our public building without proof of vaccination. If parents want to reject the science of public health measures they can home school their children. Just don’t send them to public spaces to become vectors of death."
2021-09-25 22:47:45,"Back in the 1980s, I worked in a school district that had a terrible outbreak of head lice. To break it, we all lined up before we were allowed to enter the building and our heads were checked. It took a fair amount of time, but that epidemic ended after the infected were sent home to treat the problem. 
I keep wondering why people accept the idea that parents have the right to decide whether their children will endanger others. My freedom is taken away by those who decide that their children don't have to wear masks, that it's acceptable to decline to be vaccinated, or that they don't have follow rules that protect others. 
It's one of the tragedies of COVID that there wasn't a massive effort to implement testing early during the pandemic. The outcome might have been very different if infectious people had been identified and isolated. 
The nurses in schools who are trying to stem the tide have my respect and sympathy.  It seems like a Lost Cause."
2021-09-25 23:51:27,"How could this not be a federal imperative?
Not only to mandate a rigorous testing schedule, but to do what ever is necessary to supply these tests the every school in the country, even if they must nationalize the manufacture and distribution.  
They could also create a universal broadband system and make sure all US kids can go to school remotely, if need be. 
Anything less proves that the US government’s role has more to do with protecting the profits of US corporations, with the lives of American children as a write off."
2021-09-25 23:59:50,"I loved school as a kid. 

Unfortunately I’m starting to dislike this whole school business but I’m trying to keep a brave front for my kids. 

My kids are vaccinated; everyone I know is vaccinated.  And yet my disabled son was sent home from school because he coughed twice. 

Teachers in my region are asking for isolation, testing, virtual schooling etc. 
Parents (and taxpayers) don’t want ANY of that stuff. 
That stuff might have worked in Spring 2020 but it is well past that now. 

Teachers and administrators: 
How are you going to create physical spaces, programs, outdoor activities, lesson plans for a world where Covid exists all the time?  

That’s right.
In a Covid world, how can schools be organized to teach children, in person, every single day?

This is what needs to be done."
2021-09-26 00:01:04,Our district does pooled testing in each classroom twice a week and individual testing if one comes back positive. I think it’s going great and kids swab themselves at their desk— it’s no biggie. The kids also mask with no problem. Overall it seems the kids at our school are more resilient and educated than many adults in the south.

Seeing a lot of fearmongering on major news networks about COVID's danger to kids, so just thought I'd point out that in 2018 the peak pediatric hospitalization rate for flu was 3.4/100k, while for COVID it's less than half at 1.6, yet I don't remember widespread panic in 2018"
2021-09-26 04:52:07,"The Governors of these States are responsible for all resident sin their states. if they do not follow public health measures as recommended by the CDC they are practicing a mini genocide. What are their motives to either ignore or oppose public health measures to the point where some communities in their states take them to court?

In my opinion, they are public health criminals. They just want a higher political office. Looking at you, Santis and Abbott. They will sacrifice everybody to get what they want.

What they don't realize is that position is universally hated. In the national political stage they are an outlier. No Democratic, Independent and sensible Republican voter wants to die to make these retrograde criminals, President. Meanwhile they are killing a lot of their people."
2021-09-26 10:22:36,Retired nurses are everywhere.  Has anyone thought to mobilize them?  Providing malpractice insurance and sending them to schools to work under the supervision of the school nurse could relieve them of some of the tasks.  Especially the self administered tests.  Or temperature screening.  Our local VA did that when Vaccines first came out and much more quickly vaccinated the Veteran population.  They had a glut of nurses signed up who rapidly filled the available slots to volunteer.
2021-09-26 12:49:50,"Public  high school teacher in CA, here.  No testing.  No distancing with 36 kids per room snuggled up shoulder to shoulder, back to back as always.  Masks, yes.  Teachers must constantly tell them to keep the mask on the nose.  Ventilation?  These are cinder-block bungalows hastily thrown together in 1961 to accommodate the baby boom and never upgraded.  Often windows have been intentionally sealed for security. If you have a window, you might have ventilation.  I am extremely fortunate in having windows that open on two sides of the room.  The very first day of school I had an infectious boy in the room.  The next day he was out with C19.  I went to the ""nurse"" (actually health room aid, not RN) who wanted nothing to do with my information.  There was no flow-chart, no method in place to report the case.  Me, if I survive I will retire June, 2022.  That is 3 years earlier than I would have planned."
2021-09-25 22:07:45,Remember when there weren’t enough tests and we were subjected to all these healthcare workers telling us we should be glad because a test is so unpleasant and it feels like a Q-tip is touching your brain? I guess that stuck. I guess everything sticks.￼

2021-09-27 10:39:29,"Although our situations are vastly different, I see quite a bit of myself in Mr. Naughton. What I really want is for the strangers around me whom I don’t know to do the right thing: behave well in public, get vaccinated, wear a mask, and work together to put this nightmare behind us, even if the best we can hope for is to shift from pandemic to endemic. While it is certainly better here in the northeast than the south, we have our larger than expected share of angry, unmasked and unvaccinated neighbors who want to go back to life before Covid, but refuse to do their share to help."
2021-09-27 10:58:45,"The human interest stories -with one or two anecdotes are the bane of journalism and veer towards advocacy.  The same formula is followed by right-wing with the opposite perspective, of course.

It is sad that an individual with a medical condition has to do a job that is tough and deals with hordes of the public. 

Except for vaccine mandates, and banning unvaccinated from the stores, transportation, and public spots (which I support), there is nothing one can do. 

Of course, many Walmart workers are still on the government dole, and the government should send Walmart an annual bill. 

In the times of automated checkout technologies coming to retail, these types of jobs may not exist (or in such numbers) for very long. 

NYT and Woke Left want to give everyone a room in the Ritz and permanent unemployment benefits.  The nutty right wants to abandon them. 

There is a middle ground - setting living wages, and job training and retraining to upskill and reskill workers to the demands of the digital age - where AI, ML, Robotics, and Computer Vision will take away many jobs, but also create new ones."
2021-09-27 11:11:09,"The best work Mr. Naughton can do is to get his father vaccinated; any health conditions the father has, should be downplayed to get him vaccinated - if he's likely to get very sick from Covid and he won't stay home, he needs to get vaccinated. Of course, Walmart should be a better employer as well, supporting its workers by enforcing mask mandates for customers etc. Interestingly enough, does this article mention whether the mother is vaccinated? I didn't see that."
2021-09-27 10:59:47,"I've always viewed Walmart through the lens of disdain for how they kill Main Street economies, how they kill American manufacturing in favor of stocking their shelves with cheap overseas junk, but most of all while making mega-fortunes for their family and pals, I despise their internally celebrated business model of paying their employees obscenely low wages with even more obscene garbage ""benefits."" 

Walmart is not an All-American player."
2021-09-27 11:51:10,"After reading this article and the articles about hospitals losing unvaccinated employess, I have come up with a solution.

Because of this I am going to Whole Foods, Fresh Market and Aldi's more often. I don't even think about going to Publix' where the workers don't even wear masks.
The bottom line is less voters for Trump."
2021-09-27 13:13:27,Thanks to Mr. Naughton and praise for his courage. He carries on despite a serious medical condition and offers his experience to a journalist in order to draw attention to troubling workplace problems. A shout-out for his integrity.

They actually mean “expendable.”
I think they meant “expendable” when they called half of us “deplorable.”
When we demand safety, they tell us there’s no money. When we demand adequate unemployment insurance because we don’t want to risk our lives working for them, they tell us adequate unemployment insurance is an inducement to not work. 
Yeah, so we stay alive. 
They’ve always done this…they work us until we die and then tell us about the high moral calling of work and tell us that when we are unemployed we are “lazy.”
Isn’t “lazy” a word the bosses of the world invented?"
2021-09-27 13:22:49,"This article is infuriating.  Walmart pays him $11.55 an hour.  Assuming a 40 week, Mr. Naughton still is below the Louisiana poverty line.  He goes to work ill because no one answers the phone.  He fears ""coaching"" if he asks a customer to don a mask because he might lose his job.  And a Walmart spokesperson says they offer free vaccines.....the vaccine is free to everyone!  I do not shop at Walmart because they exploit their workers.  This article tells me I made the right decision."
2021-09-27 13:52:58,"When covid first started, just going to the grocery store for 15 minutes once a week would freak me out. Then I saw all the workers there, bravely doing their 8-hour shifts day in and day out out, not knowing if they would be struck down by a deadly disease. They truly inspired me. Just the sight of them calmed me down and even made me braver too. I figured that if they could do it, so could I. A big thank you to every one of them!"
2021-09-27 14:36:56,Lets remember that Hillary Clinton was on the board of directors at wallmart and that they donated to her candidacy heavily. Both dems and rebubs are responsible for allowing such a large corporation to pay so little that their workers qualify for benefits we pay for .... we are subsidizing them whether we like it or not....it is long past time for that to end...
2021-09-27 15:20:53,"If unions are going to be successful in organizing places like Walmart and Amazon they are going to have to do more that just get their friends at the NYT to write a favorable article.  They are going to have to provide a tangible value to prospective members, which they are not doing now.  That is shown by the loss in Alabama at Amazon and by the fact that union membership is less than 10% nationwide.  It would be a lot less than that if not for the closed shop rules in the unionized companies.

As it stands now, unions are a tax on pay for little or no benefit to workers.  Old slogans and tactics about WAR!! with the company are not working and are frankly a turn off to most new workers.  If they were given a free choice, I think about half of all union members would vote with their feet and leave.

Unions are in a death spiral and are responding with the same tactics that got them into the death spiral in the first place.  They face the challenge of the dinosaurs, they world has changed and they do not appear to be capable of adapting.  If that is so, they will share the fate of the dinosaurs as well."
2021-09-27 15:22:08,"It's boom time for entry level labor and Mr. Naughton should have tremendous bargaining power. Nearly every place I go see hiring signs promising sign on bonuses.

If he's a reliable worker should be able to negotiate himself up to $20 at a non-Walmart store. Walmart isn't the only option anymore, there are plenty of stores that allow their workers dignity and a living wage."
2021-09-27 17:18:01,"Has no one told the management of Walmart that COVID-19 is an airborne virus and is also deadly?
Wearing masks for all customers and staff should be mandatory in all shops and enclosed public spaces?
It is also reprehensible that Peter Naughton, who has epilepsy is fearful to take a sick day when he has a seizure  because he might get fired. He is also fearful of going to work at Walmart because of the numerous militant, non- mask wearers he encounters at work who are likely to complain to his managers and may well get him fired.
Walmart clearly treats those unfortunate enough to work for them as totally disposable, but they may care too consider that their lack of adherence to basic health and safety and mask wearing specifically, is likely to be killing off their customers. The Delta variant is highly transmissible and deadly, particularly to the unvaccinated."

2021-09-27 17:40:04,"As taxpayers we subsidize this horrific company! Walmart employees are so poorly paid that they qualify for benefits such as food stamps, even with full time jobs!

Walmart is the embodiment of the wealth gap in this country. The BILLIONS in profit that they made last year, off the backs of their underpaid workers. 
This article should have highlighted the salary and bonus numbers for the executives of Walmart.
Walmart is a shining example of the worst of capitalism! I haven't shopped at a Walmart for decades, and don't intend to do so.
Shame on the Walmart owners and executives! How do you sleep at night?!
Shame on this insane economic structure in the United States where such inequality is allowed, and shame on the republican voters who continue to vote into power the very men who ensure this status quo."
2021-09-27 18:50:11,This is reminiscent of labor conditions a hundred years ago.  The most remarkable aspect of the story is that the government permits these workplace conditions in the year 2021.  For some reason there's no Walmart in the EU.

2021-09-27 19:33:36,"This isn't just a Walmart story.  

My brother, who could be Peter Naughton, worked at grocery store in Maryland through much of 2020.  He told me stories every week about abusive shoppers, people who would self-consciously breath on him, or spit on the floor in front of him.  For $12 an hour he and his colleagues were charged with feeding their fellow citizens.  He felt he was at war with this neighbors.  Naughton has been lucky.  

My brother, even though he was fully masked while working, did get Covid which exacerbated his diabetes, which meant days missed. Ultimately he was fired.  As one might be, he isn't keen on returning to big box store employment.  

Peter Naughton and others like him deserve better, and yes, they deserve hazard pay."
2021-09-27 19:56:58,The answer is for all concerned citizens to boycott Walmart.  You can shop lots of other places that have good prices and that require masks.

2021-09-28 00:05:35,"Walmart, emblematic of capital's worst effects, was treated with kid gloves in this infomercial. The realities of life for Walmart workers is far more horrifying than this story portrayed. Dehumanizing policies remain, defended by Walmart executives with disingenuous references to ""business constraints"" and ""the realities of today's employment marketplace,"" are slaps in the face. Human dignity, which would be so easy to preserve and honor in any workplace, is not even acknowledged. 

Other large employers perform only marginally better. In American-style capitalism (that is, unfettered and amoral capital run amok), this treatment of employees as disposable slaves is accepted and encouraged, as long as short-term stockholder expectations are met.

2021-09-27 23:34:03,Mr Naughton seems like a nice thoughtful person.   I am left to wonder if there might be a higher paying career or jobs out there for him?   maybe the New York Times should add to their career section some summaries of better jobs out there for people?   We seem to have lots of comparisons of credit cards and cell phone companies…. Part of me wonders whether a smaller firm with a generous minded owner might be a better fit?

2021-09-28 18:03:47,"From this article I understand the challenge of working for a retail store in the Covid era, never mind the further hardship of living in an area devastated by a hurricane or tropical storm. 
Possibly, a compromise can be implemented: Employees must be vaccinated and wear surgical masks, but not require patrons to do the same. For one thing, it will be difficult to prosecute patrons who are neither vaccinated nor wearing a mask. Such conflicts could also escalate, putting employees at risk for injury or further stress. 

Employees should also either go to a sanitizer dispenser station to cleanse the hands every 10-15 minutes, or carry a small bottle for similar. Do not touch the nose and mouth except in the washroom, and do not lean within 6 feet of a patron for more than consecutive 15 minutes.
In doing so, these measures will place a physical barrier between the patron's respiratory tract and that of the employee, which will inhibit bioactive viral particles transmission between people. 

Perfect or ideal? No. But (as a physician who cares for Covid hospitalized patients) I believe that these measures will go far to protect employees. Patrons will get the idea, after a while, that those who are not vaccinated or do not wear masks in public will die or have prolonged disability, and secondarily harm our economics, businesses, public services, and education system."

No kidding, and it’s not just their employers. So many people treat them abysmally by refusing to wear masks or social distance. Angry customers sometimes physically attack employees for being asked to comply with mask wearing and distancing. Even the non-violent customers who refuse to take precautions are endangering the workers though.

Besides the risks of COVID19, corporations like Walmart are simply not paying their fair share in taxes.

Low pay, terrible working conditions and terms, no dignity.  And pizza delivery has become--like most low-wage work--surveillance based like Amazon.  Smart-phone technology has enabled total control of employees in the name of maximal productivity (i.e., profits).  No more downtime between deliveries.  No talking with coworkers. No resting. No moment spent thinking of anything other than what the boss wants you to think about.  No sanity-saving personal preferences or priorities.  And the media shout about how hard it is for employers to find people to hire.  Can't imagine why?  No wonder Iowa's governor Kim Trump Reynolds cut off unemployment aid.  How else did she expect to drive such demoralized and abused hourly workers back to the salt mines?  Heck, she opposes a livable minimum wage on the same grounds: people will get lazy and work ""only"" one job if it pays enough to survive on.  How are we to fill those awful jobs if folks have any possible alternative?  For some reason she ""trusts Iowans to do the right thing"" without mandates or coercion when it comes to public health and Covid.  But trust Iowans to do what we feel is right when it comes to weighing our work, home and family obligations and choices?  Not so much.  Thank you NYT for this How The Other Half Lives perspective.

2021-09-28 19:15:17,"My son is on the autism spectrum.  He graduated college  (took over 6 years) but has held minimum wage jobs since then.  With the assistance of a NY State training program, he got a full-time job as an inside building security escort/messenger in a large Manhattan office building.  The building closed early in the pandemic, and he was one of those who earned considerably more with the $600 Federal unemployment boost while he was laid off.  They called him back after 6 weeks, and quite frankly, I was terrified of him getting sick and/or infecting others in the family.  He could easily have continued to collect unemployment as the Dept of Labor was quite lenient at the time, but his self esteem was so much greater when he was able to go to work each day.  So back he went.  This was close to a year before vaccines were available, before we were even advised to wear masks.  He took (and continues to take) a nearly empty express bus back and forth to work at a cost close to triple the normal subway cost as an extra level of caution.  He is able to do this, obviously, because he lives with us.  Someone living on their own wouldn't have that luxury - for that matter, I totally understand why that person would make the very logical decision to stay home and collect more than what they normally earn!

So please - appreciate all these people, the people we take for granted who do jobs we don't realize are essential until they aren't there anymore."

Some people at the top think others than them are disposable. We've seen that this entire pandemic. Every executive at Wal-Mart is vaccinated.

Isn't ironic that large retail ""box"" stores, including CVS, which specializes in prescription goods, which want to have or do have mini ""urgent care"" clinics don't enforce the vaccine mandate and mask wearing by their employees, and customers?  

There are many reasons not to shop at Walmart.  This story is one of them.  

This virus is going to last into perpetuity, its original form and multiple variants, the more deadly and more infection producing, will prevail.  Isn't a year and seven months time enough to change entirely.

For such a large company this is not uncommon. I logged 44 hours last week and am scheduled for 36 hours for the foreseeable future. Yeah, pretty dang close to full time, huh!?
Publix dropped my associate health insurance for 2021; COVID had negatively impacted my hours at the start of the pandemic and I missed the qualifying 1500 annual hours by 84 hours.

Companies won’t employ workers for enough hours to earn health benefits because that would eat into their profits.  As a result, the taxpayers have to pick up the slack for health and other types of public assistance for working people.  The companies and the 1 - 2% avoid paying their fair share of taxes, not even enough to subsidize their workers.  This is corporate welfare that shouldn’t be allowed to continue.  

What can you do?  Stop shopping at WalMart.  If you find that too extreme, and you enjoy browsing through the aisles for bargains, ask yourself if you really need that item.  If not, put it back.  You’ll soon discover that you don’t even need a shopping cart.  If you work at Walmart, unionize.  Don’t be afraid of the consequences.  Like Amazon’s workers’ effort, the company will try any tactic to make you back off and Amazon succeeded.  A union contract is the only solution when politicians just look the other way.  Finally, our planet would benefit.  Prices would go up.  People would buy less junk from big box stores that winds up in the dump along with all of the plastic bags used to bring that junk home."

In a Colorado hotel this past June, I happened by a group of Walmart managers having a meeting. 30 of them crammed shoulder-to-shoulder into a small conference room around a table. No masks.  The group leader started the meeting by leading them all in the Walmart cheer, which they all did, loudly. It was the most truly ignorant thing I have seen this whole Pandemic season."
2021-09-28 20:17:58,"For any right wingers reading out there...if you want to avoid socialism, then pay a livable wage.  One that covers food, housing, & medical care at a minimum.

2021-09-28 20:18:07,"The new mandates that businesses that accept Government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may offer some hope of requiring Wal-Mart employees be vaccinated.

The pharmacies participate in these programs.  Obviously they offer the vaccines to customers and so are contractors of sorts for the government.

The optometrists' offices (some are independently owned) usually accept Medicare and sometimes Medicaid programs.  The optical shops may also accept Medicare and/or Medicaid.  

My hope is that the higher ups in Bentonville see the loss of income as the incentive to mandate vaccinations.  I wonder if the SNAP program (which is a huge part of Wal-Mart's grocery business) may be construed as Wal-Mart being a contractor or vendor for the government?  Obviously I'm not in trained in the legal environment, but maybe someone could weigh in on this."
2021-09-28 20:20:07,"I worked there from August to February. Every day was horrible, the management did nothing about unmasked customers, paid leave is unheard of, and unpaid leave is hard to get.

Not most, but some. I found work in an office environment and have spent the COVID era working from home, but I shudder to think of what retail employees go through every day, and wonder how I’d react. I wish Mr. Naughton the best, and all the Mr. Naughtons everywhere; I’m fully vaccinated, but for them I happily wear my mask every day. For what they do, it’s the least I can do."
2021-09-28 20:39:31,"If any of the Waltons bother reading this story and the comments--especially the younger generation--I would challenge you to sincerely rethink how your family's corporation operates and treats its workers.

Thanks to Sam Walton's use of ""Jackie O"" trusts, you and your heirs are set for generations thanks to generous loopholes in the tax code. Generations. Of course, shareholders will be unhappy--but together as a family you have the highest concentration of personal wealth in the world. Can't you do better? How much money is enough? Let's see you provide healthcare, a living wage, and in-store security for your workers while taking the onus off taxpayers. After all, as they say--you can't take it with you."

Then how come this employee is reprimanded for doing his job and asking his customers to wear masks?

I was vaxxed at the earliest possible moment I could be, and my new job pushed me up the ladder a little.  So imagine the shock when I’m moving through those first few weeks, getting oriented, showing my worth, developing relationships with my co-workers, only to discover these half-formed quackery theories that justified a phony wait-and-see caution about getting this vital protection.  Thank God for the strong mask mandates the City and the store have held to, otherwise it would feel like crossfire in a cellblock.  Dangers on both sides of the register."

SC's vaccination rate is only about 50% and we have many tourists who are not vaccinated as well.  Today, as I waited for my booster shot, the discussion went from ""I think everyone should decide for themselves"" to ""Science says it's right,"" from a very pushy woman who speaking over others.  We all agreed, however, that Covid shots should not be a political issue.  Now if only SC would reverse its law banning mask mandates."

I'm vaccinated and wear a mask, but I still feel really vulnerable because so many customers come in unmasked (I live in an area with about a 50% vaccination rate. I've noticed that  customers have become more aggressive and just plain rude. Retail is a thankless task. And I really mean ""thankless,"" because so many customers don't bother with pleasantries a tall. They don't say please or thank you, much less apologize for nearly plowing into me with a shopping cart. They get upset at me if we're out of something - because - you know - it's my fault. Sometimes they want to argue prices, as if I had some say in the matter. Would I be working here right now if I had that kind of power?

We're also super understaffed, so we're all being worked to death. And then there's the pay: I started at 15/hour and am now bringing in 15.75/hour. That much? But there's some sorta good news: we'll be getting a $2/hour raise beginning October through December. That bad new is that the offer is only good if you stay employed until early January.

I talk to far too many Americans who don't seem to understand that THEY are the taxpayers who fund the government, and pay the 6-figure salaries, benefits, free medical care, and pensions of the politicians they ostensibly elect to represent them in Washington. Taxpayers -- not the wealth or corporations, who pay no taxes and get bailouts -- should have the power, not these greedy corporations that abuse their employees and pay poverty wages. The situation with the wealthy and their pet politicians in this country is OUT OF CONTROL. This is a plutocratic nightmare."

2021-09-28 21:19:46,"I work for a different major national retailer and have had a somewhat better experience. But I can definitely relate to Mr. Naughton's fear of customers not masking. Employees are required to mask but not everyone wears their mask properly and consistently. A few customers mask, but most don't. I do a lot of backing up to maintain social distance. And I feel nervous and stressed during most of my shift (the first couple hours are before the store opens)."
2021-09-28 21:19:59,"For the first time since before the pandemic, I shopped at a Walmart today in North Carolina. They didn’t even have a sign about mask wearing on the door. The woman ahead of me in line was not wearing a mask and chided me for standing back from her (there were no floor markers for a socially distanced line). I won’t be back unless Walmart gets its act together."
2021-09-28 21:21:00,"Funny I don't hear any right wing politician ranting about these low wage workers needing to get vaccinated or lose their Medicaid, like they rant about welfare recipients being required to be vaccinated in order to get their benefits.

Amazing that."

2021-09-28 21:53:03,"Mr. Naughton, thank you for your service to your community. You and your fellow retail workers deserve our thanks, better & safer working conditions, and a true living wage.

Corporations like Walmart have little use for their employees, because they can always get another employee for less. This is their business model."

Again, I send you all my very best, sir. Stay safe, stay well."
2021-09-28 21:47:07,"As the most highly trafficked building on any given day in nearly every area they are located, Walmart has the highest responsibility to help mitigate this crisis in all ways their vast resources can facilitate. Everything from having multiple security guards on duty to throw out people who aren’t in compliance, to allowing employees far more sick days is absolutely required of them.￼ For anyone forgetting to bring a mask they should provide their customers with one at the door.￼￼ For all still needing a Covid or Flu vaccine they should have a semi-trailer right next to the entrance with a mobile vaccination site inside, all lit up by the brightest neon signs obtainable, running from five AM thru Midnight, seven days a week. They should also be running prince magazine and television and radio ads touting masks and the vaccine. It’s not a political statement, it’s a moral obligation of the highest order.￼￼"

Are we going to do anything about this? Or just let it take us all down?"
2021-09-28 22:14:08,"I'm old enough to remember when Walmart, already with a horrible labor reputation, told Fisher Price to move manufacturing to China or it wouldn't sell their toys. I've shopped there, at most, twice in my lifetime.

Too many Americans, however, didn't care then and don't care now. Bargains and convenience are more important than national self-sufficiency or labor laws. Walmart didn't explode on the backs of isolated rural consumers without (prior) choices. It's megagrowth wasn't inevitable. And perversely, I think it survives largely because of the gluttonous real estate and health insurance industries. The top 1% truly have the rest of us in a sandwich.

I wish Naughton luck in finding well-paid remote work, outside of remote customer service where agents go 12 hours with barely a bathroom break. With my own health condition, I transcribe accident reports as a 1099. I've had to pay for my own training, background check, and liability policy. I was at least eeking out the federal minimum wage, but even that was $100-a-month too much for the multi-national that bought out the U.S. company. At least I don't have to wear someone's proud-worker smock."

I shop a lot at Trader Joe's, which had excellent cleanliness and masking policies.
Until very recently: The company decided that their employees, who are all over the store, who are vaccinated, do not have to wear masks....

Some do still, some don't, and I try to stay away from those...

I even called the company, but they are a Big company..
Now I am much more reluctant to go there.

Of course, they pay well and treat employees well, but most customers still wear masks, while workers don't.

Just a small percentage of their windfall profits from the pandemic would enable them to meet or exceed the fair benefits recommended by United for Respect.  This would boost their image and this makes good business sense.  Keeping your employees alive and kicking would also be a plus for all concerned.  The benefits to a corporation of maintainng high employee morale is reason enough to humanize their operations."

2021-09-28 23:29:56,"This article infuriated me in so many ways. How has American society, the wealthiest in the world, allowed itself to become so cruel, so uncaring that a person reeling from sickness is forced to go to work? Why is society not taking care of this person, paying his social security and providing his healthcare? How is an employer legally allowed to pay a wage so heartlessly low that 160 hours of hard work is insufficient to cover monthly rent, let alone buy food and other necessities for *one person*? How have people become so selfish that they are unable to do something even as simple as wearing a mask to save others?

It seems to me that the cruelty inherent in extreme capitalism is coming home to roost, and the karma of American excesses abroad is starting to diminish America itself."
2021-09-28 23:51:03,"So Walmart makes Billions of dollars but we, the working taxpayers, must pay for their employees healthcare through Medicaid. This should be illegal.

2021-09-28 23:54:44,"Until just over a year ago I never shopped at Wal-mart.  In the back of my mind was my sister-in-law who refuses to shop there because of how they treat their employees.   After I retired, I started shopping there sometimes -- to save money.  At the Wal-mart I shopped in, many people were masked but there were some holdouts.  The employees were, although some didn't wear the masks properly.  I never saw an angry customer or a confrontation.  I think some of Mr. Naugthon's troubles come from working in a southern state during Covid.  Obviously, not being paid a living wage for full-time work is the enduring problem.

In a capitalistic country, many companies making big bucks. Goldman Sachs, Tesla, Google, Face Book, and Microsoft etc. are all big and very profitable.  Why pick on Walmart? Walmart has many employees, but she also has many investors. Everybody wants something from Walmart. I feel sorry for Walmart. She is in a no win situation."
2021-09-28 23:24:35,"I fully sympathize with masked workers who have no control over exposure to crazy, angry anti-mask zealots. Employers should arrange a better system for worker protection from the nuts. Enforce mask wearing! I don’t have a Walmart near me, but I was in a Target within recent memory, and no one was enforcing mask wearing once customers were inside the store. 

On the flip side are the workers — generally in small businesses — who choose to not wear masks, and are allowed (or encouraged?) by employers to not mask up, and thereby expose customers to unknown dangers. Some weeks back, I went to a local diner and was served by a waitress who did not wear a mask. There were two servers (that I could see) who were maskless. Totally unacceptable. The diner changed hands this year after having been run by a wonderful person for decades. The new owner has no respect for the old customers, so they won’t get my business again. All that just to make a political pount?"

2021-09-29 00:08:33,"Thank you, NY Times, for covering one of the many people who can't do their work in the safety of their own homes. I work in a similar retail environment and have never really worried about covid, but have had some concerns about practical health concerns like 1) not going to work sick, 2) not doing things that expose others to health risk, and 3) having a time-off policy that doesn't penalize people for staying home instead of working while sick. I understand Walmart is one of the firms that use a 3d party to manage some sickness benefits, which makes sick days a paperwork as well as a recovery challenge. But it probably works ok.

And I especially appreciate the brief but shocking coverage of the crazy, psychotic stories going around about covid as everything from fake news to germ warfare to a domestic spying scheme. I've even heard the claim that a vaccination is ""the mark of the beast"", referring to a fundamentalist view of the Bible's Revelation of St. John. These claims are associated with the politics and religious views of the Trump faction. I can't help but think that some foreign power has been planting bad ideas in their heads to grow a crop of civil unrest and instability that would make dealing with a real national emergency harder."
2021-09-29 00:15:14,"I found this article to be extremely accurate in what it has been like for a frontline essential worker.  I completed my graduation degree during the pandemic, and as jobs were hard to find and I was ineligible for any government assistance (except Medicaid) or unemployment as I was a former student, I took a job at a local supermarket for seven months.  At first people were nice to us and the bond with my co-workers was extremely tight.  But once the public started getting vaccinated and the price of food went up, any notion of being a ""grocery hero"" went by the wayside.  Getting screamed at everyday because food prices were going up or certain items were unavailable, having to listen to everyone's opinions on masks while working behind an unairconditioned deli counter, my co-workers and I would take turns standing in the meat lockers to cool off.  I needed and job and I wanted to help out my community and do something during the pandemic, so I did what I had to do.  The experience was ultimately rewarding and I look at my service with pride, but now that I have gone on towards my career goals some of my anger is still with me.  Check your ego and your attitude at the door for the sake and decency of the people who make your life possible."

2021-09-29 00:23:07,"What can one say anymore?

As the lead headline in today's NYT print edition reminds us -- vaccination rates in ""Red"" states pales in comparison to those of us in the ""Blues"".

Follow on with this kind of analysis and you will undoubtedly find that the same division can be found by education and income and, to some degree, race and ethnicity.

Then think about the ""average"" Walmart shopper.

I haven't been in one of their stores in about two decades.  To me, Walmarts make the old ""bargain basements"" look high end.  Heck, there is (was) once a website with images of ""typical"" Walmart shoppers.

It wasn't flattering.

If you have to shop or work at Walmart -- I pity you to some degree.

About all one can advise to the Peter Naughtons of Walmart -- make sure that you yourself are vaccinated.

2021-09-29 00:36:44,"My friends who work at Trader Joe's in SF have described outrageous behavior by customers since last summer. They've had to add time to their meetings to help each other deal with how rude and threatening people have been. It's terribly sad that so many adults are so immature, unwilling to control themselves, and think it's their right to act out toward others who are just maintaining the store's and our local government's standards. No wonder our national statistics are so shocking - they reflect the standards of this portion of the population, which threatens to metastasize."

As the GOP continues to play “Banana Republican” politics regular hard working folks are in their cross hairs. Pawns in a nation that has the resources but not the resolve. Wealth but not the compassion. 

This is not accidental. This is precisely what has been in the works since the Reagan years. Divide and conquer while pillaging the working class.

Look at the super wealthy. How much is ever enough for them? The greed of the elite is beyond tolerable.

When I read about Mr. Naughton I feel so much sadness that he has no retirement and no employer-based health insurance even though he served so many people during the pandemic. Walmart is headed by billionaires; they really should stop asking the rest of us to subsidize their employees, even though that isn't even enough."
2021-09-29 00:41:54,"It is good to see the Times publish some stories about invisible (read:poor, working class) people for a change. As at least one commenter said, “essential” worker often translates to disposable worker, where profits and revenues are concerned."
2021-09-29 00:53:36,"Wow. If I could only talk about what I have heard and know about labor in this country. But I am by contract not allowed to. Disposable? Yes. Sick with Covid? Fired. Family member sick with Covid or any other illness? Fired. Always some other desperate person, even honest and hard working person, to fill the shoes. For a minimum wage job that does not even keep a roof over their head, only to find that they, too, will be sanctioned and and canned for missing work due to unforeseeable events.

Brutal, sick, an unconscionable. Tax the rich, and pay a living wage to people."
2021-09-29 01:10:26,"We have a mandate here that requires everyone to wear a mask in all indoor public places (such as stores) at all times. Every time I’ve been in Walgreen since, I’ve seen at least one customer without a mask being served and attended with no one voicing the slightest objection. I’ve been mulling over phoning the store to complain, but after reading this article I’ve decided instead to write the corporation. If anyone else here has noticed something similar, I hope you’ll join me. Thanks."
2021-09-29 01:10:30,"I don’t think the author did Mr. Naughton any favors by including his real name and location.

2021-09-29 01:30:40,I hope Mr. Naughton gets no repercussions from this article. Everything in this article confirms what we know about what is wrong with the Walmart model of employment in this country today.
2021-09-29 01:49:43,"It’s not just Walmart, folks. Most big box stores are the same. I’d even say most retail stores are the same. Low pay, no benefits, and work if you’re sick or no pay."

2021-09-29 02:11:53,"$559 BILLION in revenue and he's paid $11.55 an hour?! That's a disgrace and unjust. Where is the justice in that? 

Need some perspective on what a billion is? One million seconds is 11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds. One BILLION seconds is a bit over 31.5 years.

Increasing all Walmart employees’ current hourly rate by $3.45 (making Mr. Naughton’s hourly rate $15) would cost the company $5,520,000 (company portion of payroll taxes, and workers’ comp and benefits tied to the hourly rate aside). That’s chicken feed! Or has the price of chicken feed gone up dramatically?

Do the Waltons and other owners of Walmart really, decently, need all that money?"
2021-09-29 02:18:44,"I will say that as a Walmart associate the pay can use some improvement. Yes, I agree that CUSTOMERS can be mean and hateful. I've been cussed at, things thrown at me, etc. Noone has a RIGHT to shop there. It is private property and if someone doesn't like being asked to wear a mask, they can leave and shop elsewhere. The frontend associates are the first and last seen by customers who take their frustrations out on them.  They are doing their job the best they can under horrendous circumstances.
Now in Walmart's defense. I have worked at many places and Walmart is one of the few that offers health, life and dental insurance.  They also offer 401K, accidental death, etc. Walmart is generous on time off. Too generous in my opinion. No other employer allows an employee to call in as many times as Walmart allows. Walmart has an automated call in system, so even if this assoc. couldn't get ahold of the store he could have called a toll free number or gone online to report an absence. There are also avenues to go through for every kind of LOA. It sounds like this associate could apply for an intermittent leave for his seizures allowing him to call in w/o using any PTO. There is also a paid covid leave which I have seen associates abuse by taking too many and galavanting around while they are supposed to be on quarantine making it harder on those that do come to work.
Unfortunately this assoc. will probably be terminated for violating company policy by giving this interview."

2021-09-29 02:19:44,"People extol Walmart for its “low prices,” but Walmart’s prices are on a par with nearly every other low- to mid-range retailer. I won’t shop there for myriad reasons, and one of them is the lie that prices there are lower. Lower than what? Norman-Marcus — yes, but not lower than Target or Costco or any other retailer that treats its employees somewhat better, pays somewhat higher wages, and provides somewhat better benefits. Not to mention that nearly every Walmart is filthy — every time I walk into one with a friend or relative who wants to shop there, I recoil from the dirt everywhere, the barren shelves, and the generally shabby appearance of these stores."
2021-09-29 02:23:08,"At a Walmart in Arizona, a long time employee I know was let go a week before he would have had 10 years on the job (full time).  The reason they did that was so they wouldn't have to pay for his health care.  The reason they gave him was he took money out of the til.  They had a video of him putting in two one-dollars bills and taking out one two-dollar bill. He collected two-dollar bills for one of his daughters collection.  He died of a stroke soon after that."
2021-09-29 02:31:49,"Thank you so much for covering the stories of people like Mr. Naughton (and myself) who have worked in person throughout the pandemic. These stories need to be told. But when outlets like the Times frame us as ""forgotten"" or ""inhabiting another world,"" it truly makes me squirm. 

We do not inhabit another world--you see us every  day when you buy groceries, drop off your kids or go to the doctor.  We are only ""forgotten"" when media outlets choose to focus disproportionate attention on the shift to remote work. It is worth naming who is doing the forgetting, and to whom we seem to inhabit such a different world.

I read this article online. Inset in the middle: a series of links to articles on the ""The Landscape of the Post-Pandemic Return to the Office."" Please keep the focus on those of us who never got to leave."

Stores put a sign on the door, and that’s it. Stores would have to hire security personnel to deal with people entering, and they don’t do it— regular employees can’t be expected to police mask wearing."

And while they're there, they can listen to a few more, of which there is no shortage in Louisiana or America. Because of the rapacious ""trickle down"" economy that we've been running for over forty years, we have millions of American workers in similar straits, or worse. They're the reason for putting together the Build Back Better agenda that the ""moderate Dems"" continue to oppose. 

Here's a suggestion: let them spend a week working at Walmart or Amazon, or on an oil rig, or in a restaurant, or any number of places where the pay is lousy and less than enough to live on, and they can be terminated at will. Force them to get in touch with the reality lived by millions of Americans before they're allowed to take another vote or make another speech.

My sister even left a cart full of items in line and walked out when they only had a few open registers and long lines. 

The wage of $11.55 an hour is pathetic and not enough to live on. No wonder the push for a $15 hourly wage is so popular! Even that isn't enough to support a family. Until Walmart starts addressing these problems, we'll never set foot in their store again."

They make little or no effort to protect the public or their employees and consequently create a petri dish for the spread of the virus. Costco, on the other hand has done an excellent job with Covid guidelines and has since day one of the pandemic; rigidly requiring masks of everyone in the store including employees, facilitating social distancing, providing hand sanitizing stations and means to sanitize cart handles.  Perhaps Walmart should consider how many customers they may have permanently lost over the past year and a half."

Didn't work for me. After knotting, the increased pull on the top and the bottom of the mask left a big gap in the middle, right next to my nose. No amount of adjusting would remedy it. 

The size of the mask and the size of the person are variables. For smaller people, the knotting may be useful and necessary. For bigger people - like me - I get a reasonably close fit with the standard configuration.

So they'll supposedly go into a burning building to save somebody, but they won't get a vaccine for something that has killed 700k Americans? How do we know that they won't put their politics aside if a doctor or politician that they disagree with is having an emergency?

Full COVID-19 vaccinations have been offered to all of us Americans who wanted them. Also, unless we are living under a rock we're all by now aware of how masks, hand sanitizing and social distancing etc. serve to reduce risks.  Those in the US that don't 'believe' in these measures are choosing to do what they want. They were offered and the offers were rejected by some.
I think about all those wasted vaccines our country has thrown away because we'd reached a 'saturation' of people  who wanted and got the vaccine.  What if all those 'wasted' and life saving vaccines had gone instead to countries with no access to running water, where sanitation isn't necessarily possible or easy, where there are limited or no clinics or hospitals or medical supplies? Where people are dying due to lack of access to the vaccine?

Those of us who live in countries that are now promoting 'boosters' need to stop this narcissistic focus and ask our representatives to prioritize getting initial vaccine access to those places in the world who have none.  
Ensuring equal access globally should be of paramount priority.  There is such staggering disparity regarding who gets what. 
If you want to 'stop' the variants, think of this as 'in your best interest' too."
2021-09-24 08:42:06,"The NY Times could be even more clear on the distinction between ""booster"" doses and ""enough doses to reach the original goal"" doses. Boosters are for people who got a high vaccine effectiveness result— a sufficient level of protection —which might now be fading. That's one discussion.

It's the wrong term and a dangerous mindset to include in all the people who never got to a sufficiently high level in the first place. Getting them to functionally fully vaccinated is an unmet goal and a different discussion. 

Conflating the two means people are told that they're fully vaccinated when they're really not. To say that if a person got two doses by definition they must be done is like saying that if a kid getting a school lunch got two items, they must be fully fed. For kids the goal is nutrients and calories, not count of items on the tray. Only in bureaucratic accounting does getting the right count substitute for reaching the goal. 

The same applies to J&J. How is it that 70% vaccine effectiveness is simultaneously terrible and great? 70% is an unacceptably low number— mRNA recipients are urged to not stop with one dose but instead get that second dose and get into the 95% group. Money and effort go into publicizing the benefits of higher protection. But it's also a perfectly fine number— J&J recipients aren't allowed to do more, and there's little visible regulatory urgency to remove any or all the barriers to them joining the 94% (per J&J) crowd."

From what I read no mention is ever made of the obesity epidemic that has besieged the American population and which is one of the over riding factors that lead to severe outcomes if infected with the COVID virus.  Listening to the experts on public radio yesterday one of them just briefly mentioned this relationship without delving into any details.

We would never get the J&J again as a booster (that's a no-brainer); instead, we have to move over to one of the mRNA vaccines. While the CDC and others ""wait for more data"" before making additional and more detailed recommendations regarding the J&J, etc., the clock is ticking as millions of other people will get a booster. I'm sure that there are other situations of a similar nature. A lot of people don't fall neatly into the standard categories."
2021-09-24 11:48:19,I am fully vaccinated with Pfizer. But I will not get a Pfizer booster until they tweak it to address the Delta variant—something they claimed was easy. Perhaps it is financially advantageous to Pfizer to simply sell us the current product. But it is not in our best interests to get this booster only months after the first 2 shots. What’s next—2 shots a year of the equivalent of an out of date flu vaccine?

Are they giving a full dose of a half dose as booster?  Is the Pfizer booster approved because the company was first to submit their application, or because over time their vaccine isn’t as protective as Moderna?  I’m healthy and in my 50s - will I have to wait for all the Pfizer and J&Jers to get boosters before they open it up to Moderna recipients?"
2021-09-24 12:11:58,"It's been reported that part of the rational for current recommendations to the CDC is that it is better to get the rest of the people vaccinated in the US rather the giving the general public a booster would hold water if:

A. There was a shortage of vaccine shots in the US
B. They vaccine was not widely and freely available
C. Those who are not vaccinated were seeking to be vaccinated

However, since what we have are people who are actively, even violently, refusing to be vaccinated then we are holding out on boosters on false pretenses. To me it makes sense to allow those who wish to have the booster as additional protection from those who are aiding and abetting the viruses spread to be able to get it."
2021-09-24 12:56:58,Disappointed and frustrated that there's no mention of pregnancy in this article. We were constantly overlooked through this process and then berated for not getting vaccinated at high rates because we were overlooked. And here it continues.
2021-09-24 13:03:30,"Oh no.   
I forgot to say that all my family, and my extended family, did get vaccinated as soon as possible early in the year.  Some were vaccinated in December 2020. 

My comment did not say anything about mandatory vaccination. We all agree with that.  

My comment was about the conspiracy theory doubt that the perhaps first responders would betray their oaths.  

I know that we always have to say “I’m pro vaccination “ and “I never voted for Trump” these days.  Sorry I forgot to say that.  It’s true, and it’s important to say so that people don’t just assume things that are not true."
2021-09-24 13:09:24,"According to studies already published, Pfizer´s protection falls to 77 % after four months, but Moderna's remain the same, at 96.3 %. Every Pfizer's  shot has 30 mgs of vaccine and Moderna's 100 mgs. So those who got the Moderna vaccine do not need a booster, at least for now. 

However some people, independently of what vaccines they had are already asking and getting the booster and also a shot of Regeneron. I think the CDC should alert the population about the effect of those abuses."
2021-09-24 12:27:06,"So, if I’m 64, then I’m not at risk?"
2021-09-24 13:39:25,"I appreciate that Dr. Walensky approved boosters for healthcare workers. As a vaccinated person who still have breakthrough Covid (it’s over now, but was no fun while it lasted), I don’t want to encounter anyone who identifies as a healthcare worker who isn’t protecting their health and mine with a vaccination or booster. It has happened, and I asked for and got a different person to attend to those immediate needs."
2021-09-24 13:40:00,"My wife works at a local hospital and got Pfizer through work in Dec/Jan.

Like most healthcare workers she was concerned about the the long term efficacy of the two dose vaccine.

Several weeks ago the hospital mandated that all admissions to the hospital for any reason of folks 
who were vaccinated more than six months ago must be accompanied by a current Covid test before admission.

As a result, several weeks ago my wife took matters into her own hands and got a booster at CVS given she was 9 months out from her second dose.

It’s still crickets at the hospital as to when the booster will be made available to employees but my wife is feeling much better about going to work every day."
2021-09-24 14:05:45,"The bureaucratic infighting among the various public health agencies has got to stop. It's only creating confusion and cynicism with the general public. Anyone who wants a booster now should be able to get one, period. And there are far too many professors and academic types on the CDC panel and not enough real world medical professionals."
2021-09-24 14:07:28,"According to guidelines announced internally on Thursday afternoon, the Pentagon is excluding its 65  year old workers from receiving the Pfizer BioNTech booster. 

Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising when the decision makers are government employees who, along with members of the military forces, appear to be able to retire much younger than the general population."

2021-09-24 14:42:29,Got my Moderna booster on Monday. Same reaction as after the second shot—felt flu-ish. Still waiting for my 5-yo grandchild to be eligible.
2021-09-24 14:43:58,"I am still wishing for more targeted, clear communication about J&J recipients. The recent J&J study suggested strong results. But the CDC says nothing. Shouldn't those of us with J&J be widely eligible for boosters since our single dose is of midling protection but when given a second shot, so highly effective? And why is it that those in San Francisco are being accomodated for ""mixing"" a second shot but in other cases we are hearing about insurance companies rejecting it, and in yet other cases doctors doing nothing until the state makes a recommendation. We need a centralized, coordinated approach."
2021-09-24 14:58:15,"I just received my third shot yesterday at a well established pharmacy. In spite of what is going on with the CDC and in the news, it’s actually pretty easy to get one. Go online, do a quick search and you can get one within a day or two. The real problem still remains the millions of un-civic minded American adults out there who have yet to get their first shot."
2021-09-24 11:45:23,"The booster issue should be secondary to the real problem-vax deniers.  CIOVID is still killing people in states filled with the most deniers.

Those answers will only be accurate for one to count to 20 and then the FDA. Fauci, the CDC or the president or some panel  decides the science has changed again.
The science seems to change every minute.  
By tomorrow the NYTimes will publish another article.  ""Answers to your question."""

I got the vaccine, I’ve been in the air and hotel for 6 months, I’m not putting anymore of this in my body.

Pfizer would LOVE to keep this money machine going forever, and that’s fine, I own Pfizer stock, but it’s not going to be tested on me.

2021-09-24 16:29:00,"So my career is fundamentally a delivery job. I have been categorized as “essential” throughout this entire pandemic. Except when it came time to get a vaccine. Earlier this year I had to wait until pretty much everyone else was eligible to get a vaccine before I was able to get my two shots. Meaning that even though most people were allowed to work from home, and I was required to go out into the world and put myself and my family at risk, I wasn’t given the chance to protect myself or family with a vaccine before those who could stay safely at home could. I definitely think that teachers, health care workers and grocery store employees deserved to be vaccinated earlier than most of the population. But so did I, and so did everyone else who did not have the option to stay at home and work. And now I see this omission happening again. How is this fair?"
2021-09-24 16:54:36,Side effects have never been an issue with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Addressing this issue as if it warrants attention or is a reason for concerns plays into the hands of vaccine objectors who harm all of us and who are the only reason this country is not back to normalcy.
2021-09-24 14:36:50,"""While the Biden administration has said it supported booster shots for everyone who is eight months post-vaccination, the plan has been rejected by F.D.A. scientists.""

Really?  I thought the FDA only made a decision as to what should be made available NOW, rather than expressing opinion on the plan for the next year.  This is EXTREMELY MISLEADING because NY Times is publishing these articles without referencing the studies published by Pfizer- WHICH NOBODY SEEMS TO DISAGREE WITH AT THIS POINT (but which have not been peer reviewed yet) - that show how immunity drops off in the 6 months following full vaccination with pfizer vaccine.

Look at the reader comments and see how readers are getting the false impression for NY Times that CDC and FDA panels and heads are disagreeing over science, eg about what the efficacy and immunity levels are.   THEY ARE NOT DISAGREEING about this, only about the protocol for vaccinations."
2021-09-24 15:50:38,Why do they insist on boosters so soon after the initial dose? Why did the CDC oppose boosters for everyone and then suddenly the order for boosters became a mandate? Is someone getting kickbacks from BigPharma? Why are boosters normally given one to two years after the initial dose now huge profits are rolling in so why not just do as they say?
2021-09-24 16:35:17,I'm not in any rush to get a third shot while my second is still deemed mostly effective. Knowledge about the virus is evolving fast and maybe in one or two months we'll have a better view if getting a J&J is more effective if you already had two mRNA shots.

2021-09-24 17:11:33,"As a vaccinated physician who had Covid early during the pandemic I find it incomprehensible that no mention is made of the 42 million Covid survivors. There’s strong data supporting the heightened immune response in those who were vaccinated and had Covid. Many even question the need for 2 doses. I’m not against boosters, but really??"

2021-09-24 17:34:03,How does the annual flu shot timing coordinate with the Pfizer booster?  Should they be given at the same time?  Is there a preferred sequence?  An interval between them?
2021-09-24 17:46:12,"US Govt scientists from FDA and CDC have made thoughtful recommendation of an additional dose of vaccine against COVID-19 for select groups previously considered fully vaccinated. 

The select groups includes 65+ , those with underlying medical conditions like genetic or acquired immunodeficiency or conditions clearly listed by the CDC. A very high proportion of persons over 55 are diagnosed with one or more of the following diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cancer, kidney or chronic lung disease and it would have been better if a choice to receive the booster persons over 55 . 

There has been a recent rise in school children testing positive for COVID and I would recommend considering public school staff and teachers who were fully vaccinated and do not fall under the select groups also are given an opportunity for receiving a booster shot. 

Booster shots should remain a choice for everyone after a year of the 2 shots of Pfizer or Moderna and one shot of J&J if there is an indication that protective immunity is declining. For that reason it should be by now possible to define ""protective immunity"" following vaccination or recovery from severe COVID infection. Over 170 million US residents have by now received vaccines. A careful analysis of precise antibody levels of those vaccinated and have not had any serious infection since being considered fully immunized may provide insights for the gold standard for protection. This could also facilitate decisions on any boosters."

They day after the second shot I felt very fatigued with muscle and joint aches, but no fever -- slept most of the day. The third shot's effects were similar, except they lasted 48 hours, and my fatigue lasted for a week or so.  I didn't mind these side effects at all as I believe they resulted from a good immune response."

2021-09-24 20:30:16,"As a senior citizen who is eligible for the Pfizer booster, I think the CDC made exactly the right decision to allow front line health workers to also receive it.

It looks like the Janssen vaccine pretty much disappeared from the market and it's all Moderna and Pfizer now. I get people patting my hand and saying, ""Well, you won't DIE."" The problem is that getting sick is bad enough. I live alone and don't have anyone to take care of me. I dread the idea of losing my sense of smell because I'm prone to food poisoning and smell everything before I eat it.

And then we have that 40 or so percent of the population who are currently banging their fists on their high chair yelling, ""You are not the boss of me!"" and refusing to step up and help their country and get a simple vaccine.

1. First and second doses should have priority over third doses
2. If there's a conflict between two people who want to get 3rd doses, the one who had their 2nd dose earlier wins (when you got your 2nd dose is already a function of the criteria laid out by the CDC; why reinvent the wheel?)"

For example, Israel recently reopened to groups of tourists who have been fully vaccinated in the last 6 months. Currently, a lot of Americans can only get boosters after at least 6-8 months, and even then only for Pfizer. This leaves those of us with Moderna doses out of the loop. And what happens 6 months after the booster shot? That Israeli regulation may have been based on research, but it's unsustainable unless other countries play along with it somehow.

Moderna 100mcg + 100mcg = 200mcg add a booster of 50mcg and you get 250mcg.  A 3rd shot of Moderna 100mcg brings you to 300mcg.

Are Moderna recipients getting too much, and Pfizer recipients not getting enough still?"
2021-10-16 19:02:24,"Can I mix COVID vaccines?
""It is not recommended."" 
However, it is also not not recommended. In the NPR news it was reported that in countries like Canada where supplies were scarcer and less reliably scheduled, people were mixing their (mRNA?) vaccinations.

On another NPR vaccination interview with doctors, one doctor described mixing vaccinations as akin to police photos of a suspect from different angles, which would more likely identify and catch them.

Alright, I'm one of those often lost in analysis paralysis, looking for the best/perfect versus the good enough, but given free choice, I might wait for Moderna's variant (Delta?) modified vaccination as my booster (I was vaccinated with Pfizer in March 2021) scheduled to be tested by early 2022.

Furthermore, the dosing of Moderna, J&J, and Pfizer vaccines and boosters seem more tailored by their marketing departments. (What seems clear to some, J&J's ""one and done"" was a niche marketing ploy, especially in the current consideration and revelations of its longevity and booster.) 

In the race to prove ultimate effectiveness and longevity, Moderna won, but, again, why didn't Pfizer offer a larger dose to match Moderna?

I'm definitely getting my Pfizer booster (I'm 69 years old) this week, unless I hear on NPR that...

I took this year’s flu shot about 5 days before and my arm was a bit sore but with the booster nothing. I am so tired with both tv and print media constantly when talking about the vaccine have pictures of a needle going into someone’s arm. Really, do we really need to keep showing this? We get it already! Growing up in an age when doctors reused needles, after disinfecting them of course these needles now are so thin and sharp there is no pain.

""Its members are also supposed to discuss a federal study that suggested that those Americans might be better off with a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech booster."" What is going on here?

Also why a 6 month wait for any booster shot? Explanation for this. And what is the expected results before another mRNA booster shot is needed.  ""wait until at least six months after their second shot. In addition to a lack of safety data, getting a booster too soon is probably a waste of a dose and may not increase your antibodies in a meaningful way.""

Every shot is now being based on immune systems and risks, yet what are the immune system and risks to children under 11-0? Not talking about 

Again on 10/8/21 this from Reuters by Nancy Lapid -""Delta does not appear to make children sicker; Secondary immune response stronger after infection than after shot"". 
Have you the readers/commenters/reporters either read about this or investigated it further? Scientist/peer reviews?

""The C.D.C. has said the risk of complications from Covid-19 is highest for people with ..."" but children in this age group are not evened mentioned.????

According to a recent Nature news article by Ewen Callaway ""People who have previously recovered from COVID-19 have a stronger immune response after being vaccinated than those who have never been infected but vaccinated""

Does super immunity mean super protection? Maybe maybe not. No one for sure knows what is the gold standard of immunity for long lasting protection. There is mounting evidence that the immunity acquired after moderate to severe COVID is longer lasting than immunity acquired by 2 vaccine doses of Pfizer or Moderna or 1 dose of J&J. Add a booster and immunity gets better does that mean longer lasting protection? No easy answers because it is unethical to challenge a vaccinated person or a warrior who has fought COVID. So we have to wait to find out for sure what level and quality of immunity would be considered as optimal to provide protection that is long lasting."
2021-10-17 11:50:31,"That is the recommendation for today. Wait till tomorrow it could change after a new study founds out it is not effective or causes bad side effect.

There are three types of people re vaccination shots. All three are needed.

1-The first in  line, going out of their way to be first to get it. The downside is not knowing possible bad side effects or whether the shot works. The upside, somebody has to start to get it to know the results.

2-The opposite, the person who will never get it or delays too long. The downside is that they will not get the benefit of a good vaccine that may save their life. The upside, if the vaccine is bad, they will not get the bad/deadly results. 

3-Most people are in the middle. Wait for some evidence to see if it works and then get it, especially if the disease is like covid.

I am number three.."

The efficacy of these shots could be as little as a couple of months for a disease that was killing thousands annually. Covid is more dangerous but the vaccine is much better than corresponding flu shots. It only follows that we must re-up the covid shots to avoid more breakthroughs with a deadlier disease in the long term. Covid shots gradually lose their effectiveness also."

While I don't attribute this lack of information to malice, or any kind of bad-faith, I can emphathize with those who received the J&J and  feel like they tried to do the right thing--get the first vaccinne available--and were subsequently forgotten about."

I also got my flu shot at the same time (other arm). That's a little sore, but not as much as the Covid arm."
2021-10-17 14:31:27,What seems to be missing in all the “everything you need to know about the booster shot” articles is this question:  how long after experiencing a breakthrough infection should one wait before getting a booster shot?
2021-10-18 10:56:45,"Considering all the talk about boosters, and being able to get one, why no objective information about the fact that booster are merely a 3rd shot of the original vaccine created to combat the first iteration of COVID, and not the Delta, now in its 4th permutation.

We already know from substantial empirical information as well as data, the current vaccines based on 20th century antibody platform derivatives are presenting as insufficient.

So where is the search for a better alternative?  For an alternative based on the T-cell side of the human immune system?   Where is the honest appraisal of what is really happening from all the self-described ""experts?"""
2021-10-16 23:10:04,"Continuing the confliction of this program.

""the same expert committee will recommend whether the roughly 15 million people who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine should also be eligible for booster doses. Its members are also supposed to discuss a federal study that suggested that those Americans might be better off with a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech booster.""

""The F.D.A. authorized booster doses for workers whose jobs put them at high risk of exposure to potentially infectious people. So far, that includes health care workers, teachers and day care staff, grocery workers, transit and postal workers and people who work in homeless shelters or prisons"" Yet at the same time 
Again does this mean mRNA vaccination work's or do not work,  for non - immune system compromised people, those who do not fit the criteria stated?

For a booster, ""Proof of an underlying medical condition won’t be required.""

""While the Biden administration has said it supports booster shots for everyone who is eight months post-vaccination, F.D.A. scientists have rejected the plan.""
One says yes the other says no!!!! What is Pfizer saying, Moderna, & J&J?

""While data are limited, "" we can state this....

""Can I mix Covid vaccines?

I am 66 and was not fully vaccinated until July 7th.  So now I have to wait until January 7th to get a booster which leaves me vulnerable and essentially housebound for now.  Perhaps supply deficits are creating this false narrative-- that booster shots being given sooner than after six months from your second dose would not be as effective.  Israelis are allowed to get booster shots after five months, and they have proven to be very effective!  This is not very encouraging when it comes to this country's handling of the pandemic.

""Getting a booster too soon is probably a waste of a dose and may not increase your antibodies in a meaningful way.""

In fact, the anecdotal evidence I'm familiar with shows a decline in many people's antibodies after 4-5 months and then a massive increase in antibodies after a booster. As well in one doctor's practice the handful of vaxed patients who were infected were unbolted and had low antibody levels. 

The Israeli experience with boosters also seems to cut against your statement. 

The reality is we don't know for certain."

2021-12-07 21:59:40,"I got my Moderna booster shot a little over a month ago. I really hope it’ll hold up since I am over 50 and have several medical conditions that the CDC lists as high risk for COVID complications. That we are talking about boosters, on the scale and in the context that we are talking about them, indicates quite clearly that the existing vaccines are insufficiently effective for controlling the pandemic. Their immunity against serious complications wanes too quickly, especially for older people, and their protection against infection and retransmission is very short term. In view of these facts I don’t understand why there isn’t a major push being made to develop different vaccines, based on other techniques and approaches. It seems to me that this task should be considered a high priority, both for the US and the world."
2021-12-07 22:33:37,"How many jabs will be enough, 3 shots within 6 months and possibly a 4rth in the works to stop the omicron variant?  Possibly 4 shots within a year.  Can this be done without repercussions?  How many people in the U.S.-350 million, say 300 million eligible for 4 shots-1.2 billion in a year.  Can the needles be re-used or are 1.2 billion needles going to end up in landfills?  And how about the vials that contain the vaccine?  What was the death rate agains 1.5 to 2 %.  And the greater majority of these people suffering from underlying co-morbidities.  Is this call to have every one vaccinated  really necessary?"
2021-12-07 22:47:15,"So let's talk about how long before we need a booster to the booster -- since the public health message has lagged rapidly changing developments with the science, it's not too soon to start considering whether we need a booster again, six months after the first. For many of us, it's already been three months. I believe the guidance for the immunocompromised is that another shot is needed six months after the third. Many health experts are saying that the CDC should change its definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include at least one booster, since it does recommend that everyone get boosted. But the CDC said that's not gonna happen any time soon. The reason is doubtless political: Biden will no longer be able to proudly declare, ""56% of adults are fully vaccinated."" It doesn't sound as good to say 26%."

It would be rather ironic if mutations arising in unvaccinated populations gave rise to an attenuated but much more infectious strain that would provide 'natural inoculation' with mainly only the cold-like symptoms of the other four endemic coronaviruses, for those who'd resisted vaccination.

Or that science writers will be able to convince the public how random mutations mostly die, occasionally survive because they have no effect on the operation of a virus, and once after millions upon millions of utterly random changes, produce a “better” virus.
A virus is a collection of genetic material that is almost below calling “alive” - it even needs a host to handle reproduction - can’t breed on its own.
That reliance is one reason viruses mutate so quickly - each cell they infect and cause to make more viruses is optimized to do other things entirely - optimized through millennia of its own mutations, which are maintained if they improve the function of, in this case, a much more complex system called a human.
Viruses mutate constantly, and get exhaled by an infected individual - most don’t even get picked up by another and die within a few minutes.
They have no mechanism for “outsmart”ing anything.
Please, stop trying to be cute when describing viruses, the methods by which vaccines and antiviral meds work - along with everything else concerning COVID-19.
Straight talk may help the millions who have refused vaccination for what amount to irrational fears, or believe deworming drugs for dogs and cattle are “safe” or “effective” killers of clusters of molecules that are millions of times smaller and exist in a manner so different from parasitic worms that they make worms look like our first cousins."

They took 6 weeks to give an EUA to the Pfizer vaccine in the fall of 2020. Meanwhile, people were dying.  It was clear boosters were a good thing in August.  Why did it take months to approve them for everyone?  Now it is the antivirals that the world is depending on if new variants are not responsive to the vaccines.

COVID test kits are reportedly widely available in pharmacies, grocery stores and big box stores in European countries for around $2 per test kit - or free.

My public library here in Virginia put up a notice that free COVID tests kits would be available beginning last Saturday morning.  An hour after opening, all the kits were gone.

I finally paid $25 plus $10 shipping to have one COVID test kit shipped to my home a few days ago.  I can't afford to order multiple kits.

Its crazy that this country can't figure out a way to make free or very inexpensive COVID test kits available in all pharmacies, grocery stores and big box stores.

Its two weeks from Christmas when millions of Americans will want to gather with families and friends and maybe attend festivities at schools, churches and other places folks congregate during the holidays.

And yet there are no widely available cheap or free COVID test kits.

Slowly, that has fallen by the wayside.   Minister, choir and now some church members freely go without masks.

It was a miserable day but it by the time I woke up on Sunday 12/5 I felt just fine. I wondered if the Moderna shot causes more reactions than Pfizer?

What’s annoying is that the US never acknowledged how strong the natural immunity after having Covid is, although it was widely acknowledged in Europe and the rest of the world.

Now there will be a need for a new vaccine specifically tailored for Omicron, and you will need boosters for that one in a few months. Until the next variant.. then you will have to repeat all this.

How about people start eating clean food, be active, sleep, reduce stress, boost their immune system. I believe in science but it doesn’t have all the answers when things are changing so fast."

We’ve been informed (remember?) since the beginning of vaccine development that corona viruses (like the common cold) are poor targets for vaccines for the exact reasons that render the existing vaccines potentially less effective against omicron. Corona virus mutations are too frequent and too varied for a static vaccine to address. Lest we end up on a “vaccine treadmill,” our best “real” hope is a much less lethal, readily transmissible variant that, upon recovery, confers a natural immunity that provides some defense against reinfection by it or other variants of the virus -people get sick, get over it, and remain resistant to the virus naturally so we reach herd immunity. Will this happen, and if so, when, and what roles do vaccines play in getting us there? I’m vaccinated as part of the journey with you all, and am not expecting the vaccine to solve this for us.

2021-12-08 22:25:52,"A booster shot of the current vaccine is better than no booster shot. 

But a booster shot of the current vaccine will not be enough. For a comparison of the original D614G virus to omicron, the results range from about 20 fold to 40 fold drop in binding for neutralizing antibody binding assays.

We don't need to be reassured - we should not be less worried, we should definitely be MORE worried than we are.

Omicron is rising so fast that it is forecast to be the dominant detected strain in most EU countries between 1-2 weeks. Since there is a lag with testing, by the time it is dominant in detected infections it will have undergone a couple more doublings, that's how fast it seems to spread. 

The US is probably not that far behind. 

Because of the lag between infection and detection, and detection and hospitalization, it will be WAY too late to react productively by the time people become concerned. 

Hospitals are at 50% capacity? Hmm, with a doubling time of 2.5 days, if we lockdown right now we have only 5 doublings to go....oh, wait.....

This is the one where everyone may finally figure out about exponential growth."
2021-12-08 23:07:14,"Isn't there some connection between virulence and spread? If Omicron causes milder symptoms, I would have to guess more infected people stay out and about and spread the virus to more people. To spread so quickly and steadily, I wonder if it can make people only so sick? So there could be an upside along with a downside. More people get sick, but more of them recover quickly and fewer need hospital care.

Also wondering if a booster on top of our boosters may prove helpful? In other words, what if we complete a second vaccine cycle? Is this possibility even worth looking at?"

Nobody has disclosed what vaccines, including boosters, those patients received nor when they got their boosters--not even the Chicago patient's gender.

2021-12-10 22:59:14,I'm incredibly frustrated with all the news reports talking about how people need to get a booster shot when I can't find anywhere to get a shot for at least 2 weeks. Without sounding too much like a complainer I don't really have the time or desire to get a shot that might make me feel ill for a day or two the week of Christmas or New Years. Until we have easy access to booster shots I wish the media and government/health officials would lay off the lectures about getting boosted. I don't know if getting the initial doses are as difficult to schedule but I understand now why those who might be interested could easily be deterred from the arduous process of scheduling. My first shots were easily scheduled at a mass vaccination site and if boosters are so important I don't understand why we're not following the same process now. Let's get it together health people and make this easy and convenient or stop making a big deal about the booster shots!

2021-09-24 02:57:39,"The difference in the distribution of the vaccine now versus ""then"" (January through May) is striking. Gone are the mass vax centers. Now, pharmacies and primary care doctors' offices. Supplies of all 3 US-approved vaccines are abundant, with excess doses being thrown in the trash every day. So, if you qualify for a booster, get it in your doctor's office. If you don't qualify, but feel more comfortable getting a booster, discuss your feelings with your doctor. If you initially received Moderna or J&J vaccine, hang in there a few more weeks, knowing that you are still strongly and durably protected, until booster policy is established for these vaccines. 

What's really needed right now is to get first and second doses of vaccine into the unvaccinated, who are still getting sick and dying in breathtaking numbers (and are the breeding ground for newer and more dangerous variants).  And, most importantly, urgently fixing the global distribution system so poorer countries can vaccinate their populations."

2021-12-12 16:08:05,Please get the shot however this Omicron could be the change we want.  It is dominating Delta but no deaths so far.  This could be the endemic dynamic that Spanish flu went through.
2021-12-12 16:17:09,"I had my booster a months ago. Everybody should get one because delta is the dominant variant now. But I don't appreciate so many ""specialists"" still telling us that it will protect us against omicron, when Mr. Sahin, the founder of BioNtech said in an interview that I heard last week that, following their first results, it is 25 times less effective against omicron."
2021-09-18 19:20:40,"The evidence shows that covid-19 initially was about ten times deadlier than the flu. Vaccines and better treatments have reduced the death rate, but even so, it is still several times deadlier than the flu.

And ironically, masking and physical distancing etc have reduced flu's deadliness. So it seems that covid-19 will be several times deadlier than the flu for the foreseeable future.

That is, if no future mutation turns out to make covid-19 even more lethal."
2021-09-18 19:36:09,"What a gloomy Gus! As a moderate liberal and a retired scientist, I am a bit more inclined to a positive and constructive preparation for the next world crisis. *If* we invest in resilience... increase our investment in education, technology, and the future of our planet, we will have eager young scientists in place - with good resources behind them - to invent the next vaccine or the next CO2-reducing technology. My technologist friends here in the US and around the world are convinced that the US, EU, and China have the capacity to step up and make the necessary investments. But what I hear from many of the pundits is pure Jeremiah, we're all going to burn, let's cut taxes and live it up because we are living in the end times.... Ugh! Please be constructive for a change."

2021-09-18 19:49:35,"If Covid were 10 times more deadly & we were approaching 7 million deaths in the US, most of them would be unvaccinated....perhaps not. A 10X death rate would mean that the vaccines were not working at a level that prevented most deaths, unlike now."
2021-09-18 19:57:20,"I take solace from one thing we learned from the pandemic…it’s something we never knew before, not here in NYC. What we learned is how efficient masks are at preventing a virus from spreading. Masks are cheap and easy to use and they get the job done. Here in NYC we are the mask wearing capital of the world.

In a walk around Midtown today, I see that masks are ubiquitous. Not everyone wears them, they have to if they go indoors, but out on the street on this warm Saturday in September…at least half the people were wearing masks, and children are the true believers…it’s rare to see a child without a mask..which makes sense because children under 12 have yet to be approved for the vaccine.

Many of my friends wear masks even though they have been vaccinated…and why not…it’s truly no hardship…they have been wearing masks since May of 2020…and like me they haven’t had so much as a sniffle in all that time..No colds, no flu no nothing. 

I think we will be wearing masks for some time , especially during cold and flu season. And if that something worse ever comes along…we already have the solution…you buy it from Amazon, 50 in a box, will cost you about 15 dollars …and if you want to double mask no problem.

15 dollars is cheap enough to stop that something worse or anything else that comes along."

Suppose covid has an infection fatality rate of roughly 1% (more or less correct). We've had four(?) covid/vaccine-denying right-wing talk radio hosts die of covid. This seems to imply there are hundreds of covid/vaccine-denying right wing talk radio hosts out there, in small or medium radio markets across the country. We begin to get an inkling as to why vaccine resistance is so high in red-state rural states."

Are many of the lovely hills and ridges and forests in California prone to wildfire?

Yes. But that doesn't mean you give Donald Trump a pack of matches and tell him to make sure he gets ratings.

Likewise, people panic during mass crisis. March 2020 was the onset of a global crisis unlike any other. This is not a military base, this is a free society. With all the crazy lack of discipline that entails.

But, you still don't give Donald Trump a pack of matches and tell him to make sure he gets ratings.

Pro-tip: remove the media from this equation, especially the level Trump and associated elements operate at, and imagine that world. That's the ringer here. That's the crazy-amplifier."
2021-09-18 20:08:14,"I have heard some say that, if Covid started impacting children and babies, the vaccine-hesitant and anti-maskers would come around to protect kids.  Well, sadly here we are and they simply don't care or are so caught in a parallel universe of misinformation and conspiracy theories that they are willing to risk the heath of everyone's children rather than do something simple like mask and, when possible, get a vaccine.  

When I hear them say, it's only 1% of children who end up hospitalized and less than that who die, I get very angry.  I am sure many of these same people are fervently anti-abortion, believing that not one zygote or fetus should ever be lost.  What if  it's your child that gets horribly ill, gets long covid, or worse yet succumbs to Covid?  I have no patience any longer with anyone who refuses to protect public health, especially that of children, when all they are asked to do is wear a mask and/or get a highly studied, safe vaccine."
2021-09-18 20:09:35,"""Today it’s clear that the public-health authorities got all kinds of things wrong, and many bad decisions—especially about closing schools—were made in an atmosphere of panic.""

This column is not unreasonable overall, but ""panic"" is a loaded word. Decisions were made with urgency and with necessary uncertainty because we didn't know what this virus would turn out to be over time. Of course we got things wrong. A body of Covid knowledge did not spring fully formed from the brow of Fauci; knowledge grew with the pandemic.

Although it seems we could've handled school better, we don't actually know what would've happened if all students had been kept in school. Yes, we could've implemented a rigorous national program of protocols: masking, testing, building air purification systems under national emergency provisions, commandeering empty shopping mall units as classroom space for smaller ""pods,"" and bringing on new teachers' aides and staff with temporary certification to support this distancing. But we all know that Republicans would've screamed bloody murder about interfering with local schools, and that the previous administration lacked the will, vision, and competence to carry out such a plan in the name of the public good.

Setting aside partisanship, in the beginning we didn't even know whether dogs in our family might be carriers, let alone human children. Public health officials and medical personnel did the best they could in an absurdly politicized environment."
2021-09-18 20:10:36,"From a public health standpoint, I'm not sure that closing schools was a bad choice.  From an educational, developmental and economic standpoint, sure.  But it certainly was the right call when we knew so little about transmissibility and the short and long term impacts on children.  A right decision can still be poorly executed.

The problem I have with the response to the response is that most of those that are against any measures seems to be against all measures.  So sure, keep schools open but wear masks.  Or get vaccinated and no masks.  Or stay home for all I care.  But any decision is one too far for the most agitated among us, many but not all of them on the right, and that's where the problem lies.  That's what I worry about for the other impending crises: climate change, diplomatic conflicts, and future viruses among them.  Refusing to do anything means doing nothing and we can't afford to do nothing when confronted with crises."
2021-09-18 20:12:17,"As long as we're engaging in counter-factuals (more like alternate histories), imagine that Democrats were in charge when we were attacked on 9/11. Would Republicans have rallied around President Gore like Democrats did around President Bush?

The point is, Republicans established a ""counter-reality"" oppositional personality during the Clinton administration, and it has worked for them politically since.  This has metastasized into anti-science, anti-fact, anti-democracy lunacy since, and this politics informs their policy and governance to this day. The base and beyond mostly still believe COVID-19 is a hoax, and they somehow believe intimidating public health officials and other public servants is a way to win the argument.

Maybe Douthat knows the Republican base better than I do, but his speculation that Democrats might not have taken the pandemic as seriously, had Trump acted responsibly, is absurd"
2021-09-18 20:15:20,"From Australia, it seemed many of the lockdown measures were half baked. Bars open, schools closed. Few travel restrictions or quarantine. It was almost as if you decided that you would only fix the holes on one side of the ship."
2021-09-18 20:16:07,"""And if they were 10 times higher I think there might have been more red-state support for public-health restrictions of all kinds.""

Perhaps, but we are watching in real time as many red states literally run out of hospital capacity. Meanwhile, their governors refuse to enact even the most basic mitigation measures. They would prefer to postpone surgeries, ship patients thousands of miles out of state, and ration care to critically ill patients rather than change their position. For them, politics matters more than lives.  At this point, I doubt that even ten times the number of deaths would move them or their supporters. This behavior will provide an endless wealth of case studies for our future psychology students."
2021-09-18 20:17:49,"There can be no doubt that there will be another Covid, and it's likely to be worse, if not far worse.  Humans have crowded into animal's ecospheres on all sides, and scientists of differing ethical standards are working away in biolabs.  Something will emerge.  Right now we're like outfielders trying to catch a popup fly ball in the sun, yelling ""I got it!"".  So far we have.  But don't bet the farm that we'll keep doing so.  I for one am glad I'm in my 80's."
2021-09-18 20:18:34,"There is no doubt that if covid had been as deadly among children and people in their prime rather than the ""disposable"" elderly, the number of vax deniers would decline dramatically.

2021-09-18 20:20:21,"If we were talking about Ebola or some other virus that was far more deadly than Covid, every single person right now rejecting the vaccine would be beating other people up in order to get it. There is no question about that. It is only because they don’t see people suffer or die that they do not seem to care."
2021-09-18 20:24:39,Why are we dragging this possibility up? Just to make everything MORE scary and more divisive snd more doom amd gloom? Is it helpful to have people hate each other more?
2021-09-18 20:25:41,"One of the biggest reasons that this virus spreads with such ease is that it makes only a small proportion of those infected seriously ill. This makes convincing people who have not seen anyone seriously ill unsure that it’s truly a problem about which they should worry. They don’t feel that taking precautions which inconvenience them are justified if they do not place much faith in experts. Increase the truly sick by a magnitude might make more people willing to follow experts advice. But right now our hospitals and trained medical personnel are fully committed, so tens the demand upon them probably that many who cannot be treated."
2021-09-18 20:27:32,"We already know how liberals would have reacted if Trump had fully supported proper safety measures like masking, lockdowns, and vaccines.  They would have supported him. Liberals did not criticize Trump in early spring 2020 when the nation was put on pause.  They did not resist vaccines when distribution started in December 2020 under Trump's watch. Republicans are solely responsible for the politicization of public health measures to combat Covid. Yes, things would have played out differently if Trump had embraced science and public safety. Hundreds of thousands of American lives would have been saved."
2021-09-18 20:11:47,"The ugly truth is that, in the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, it ended when it ran out of carriers.

That is, enough people died the virus could not replicate in new hosts.

We are so desperate to save lives,and vaccinate, that, like with warnings about to rise of anti-bacterial wipes and soaps and such, we are killing off the weak forms and creating super-viri.

We are creating these variants.

And as we kill off the delta variant, it will only pave the way for a super variant.

Sad to say, in some cases, we should allow people to die to kill off the vectors."
2021-09-18 20:29:18,"Yes, 1 in 500 Americans dead from COVID-19 is better than 1 in 50. Since COVID-19 deaths are likely to be under-reported, just as cases are under-reported, we can agree that even if the correct number is 1 in 400 Americans or 1 in 300, that is much better than 1 in 50. BUT WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT 675,000 DEATHS IN 18 MONTHS, MANY WHICH WERE PREVENTABLE HAD MORE OF THE POPULATION, NOT ONLY BUT ESPECIALLY IN REPUBLICAN LED STATES, HAD EMBRACED REASONABLE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES AND VACCINES, WHEN THEY BECAME AVAILABLE. So, YES, it has been much worse than many head-in-the-sand optimists and Trumpian political opportunists and media apologists acknowledge."

2021-09-18 20:36:28,"People (some in Canada, a higher percentage in the U.S.) have shown degrees of ""anti-social"" self-interest in this pandemic. Playing numbers games with casualties, showing indifference to seniors, those of other ""tribes"" and those whose lifestyles have made them somehow deserving of getting ill from Covid-19, are not benevolent, patriotic characteristics of our idealized civilization.

These worse- and worst-case scenarios are possible (see: smallpox, Ebola, etc.) and must be contemplated and learned from. Every citizen needs to prepare for future pandemics. Even if the next one is ""relatively"" mild, the social disruptions can be reduced.

For example, everyone, over time, should stock up on canned/dried foods, water, toilet paper, basic medical supplies, fuel if possible, masks of course, and anything they consider essential. This could prevent the shortages and lineups that can lead to violence and deprivation. A six-month or one-year stockpile could be managed by cycling through new supplies to avoid excessive aging of perishable goods."
2021-09-18 20:37:53,"There have been pandemics throughout history, but there are three huge differences with Covid. One difference is that we have stunning science compared to past pandemics with influenza, smallpox, bubonic plaque and cholera--advantage to humans. The second difference is that Covid is changing remarkably quickly--advantage to the virus.

The third difference is that we have social media-driven disinformation machine coupled with a weakening of trust in expertise. Advantage to the virus, and that is why we are losing over 1000 Americans a day."
2021-09-18 20:42:04,"""whether there’s a world where Donald Trump went all-in for strict disease-fighting measures and liberals turned anti-lockdown in response""

You, and so many others, really still somehow don't get it.

This is not how this works. Liberals have been pro disease-fighting-measures because the goal is fighting disease, not sticking it to conservatives. If trump had done a good job of trying to fight COVID - or had even made an earnest attempt - he probably would have been reelected."
2021-09-18 20:44:37,"What is interesting about the response to Covid is that it mirrors the American response to most challenges that require a collective, long term, patient approach to a problem.  The majority’s  of Americans will not react or respond until the house is *actually* on fire.   This is true for health care, retirement, investment in critical infrastructure, and the denial of global warming.   

Roughly 675,000 have died of Covid thus far and roughly 50% of American's are still arguing over masks, preventative behaviors and vaccines.     Maybe a million deaths will resonate?  2 million deaths?  Who knows? 

Covid-19 will not be the last time this happens and based on the past, America will not be prepared."
2021-09-18 20:48:17,"One thing that the writer doesn't take into account is that there are people who don't believe the death count. I have had many people at my workplace assure me that the death counts are a lie, that they have ""a relative who is a nurse"" who assured them that death certificates in the hospitals were being falsified to blame COVID for the patient's death so as to get more money from China or the government (different people said different things). So if you don't even accept the basic data, you will more easily justify your resistance to masking or the vaccine."
2021-09-18 20:49:11,Douthat's written point is a mute argument.  What he really shows us is that people whose identities are based on their political affiliation will do anything to avoid bucking the group that they belong to.
2021-09-18 20:57:08,"A 10 X increase in mortality would certainly have convinced many anti-vaccrs of the wisdom of getting shots.  I believe that most anti-vaccers don't remember the usual childhood diseases which were epidemic in my childhood - measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, whooping cough, diphtheria. and worst - polio.  (I had the first 4.)  Vaccines have made all of them rare."
2021-09-18 20:57:30,"At the very beginning of the pandemic, I thought the concerns about it were overblown. But I have a friend whose sister is an epidemiologist, and so I was quickly disabused of any such notions by a judicious application of facts. I’m pretty sure that reading an article by someone like Zeynep Tufekci would have convinced me before too long, so it’s not like one has to personally know an epidemiologist.

I honestly do not understand a lot of folks’ thought processes, no matter how many ways they are explained to me."
2021-09-18 20:58:23,"Unfortunately, I think the 10 times death scenario would only have moved the Republican party if the majority of those nearly 7 million deaths were in their base.  Losing several hundred thousand of their supporters doesn't phase them because it isn't enough to make an electoral difference. Losing millions might--at least, if those millions were in their base."
2021-09-18 21:01:06,"I personally have not had a close friend or family member die. But it is not all luck but partly location and politics. My family all live in blue states and all of them mask and are vaccinated. In the last 2 weeks, 3 friends have lost unvaccinated family members in Trump states or counties. My brother mentioned a colleague has 2 parents in Boise on death’s door. This is a deadly disease especially if you are not vaccinated. Our luck may run out but we will try an avoid the virus if we can. If you are a responsible member of our society, you will do your part to stop the spread of Covid. Sadly this should be a blue community or state issue. True patriots vaccinate."
2021-09-18 21:01:22,"Ross is still missing the point.  Those who obsess about case fatality rate are simply choosing to ignore the things that really matter:  the hospitalization rate, ICU bed usage, and length of stay.  

The more COVID fills the hospitals, the more the hospitals cannot provide care for non-COVID disease.  It would be wonderful if just once we could see a real discussion that mask wearing (which we do all day in the hospital), vaccination, and boosters are all to keep the hospital system functioning and not overwhelmed."
2021-09-18 21:01:24,"What does Ross Douthat know about COVID? He is neither a virologist nor someone who had severe COVID infection. COVID is deadly, period. It is NOT as deadly as smallpox (mortality varied from (1-30%) or Ebola (40%-90%) or Influenza H5N1 (53%) but let us start from why 4.55 million of our fellow inhabitants of our planet died and over 670,000 US residents mostly age 65+, have died from COVID in just 20+ months since COVID escaped from Wuhan, China.

COVID attacks the very organs that help us breathe. If we cannot breathe we cannot live and therefore life support with ventilators, oxygen and oxygen concentrators was so critical.

Receiving standard of care for COVID for baby boomers and seniors only became available in the USA following Trump care (care Trump received when he had COVID in Oct 2020) well before vaccines became available to the general public for mass immunization. I am both a virologist and a COVID survivor transformed into a COVID warrior on behalf of the 40 million surviving COVID cases in the USA. One weekend in Nov 2020, I almost died but I did make sure that I received Trump care by discussing latest advances in treatment which I expected not only to block the rapid multiplication of the virus with monoclonals but also managing the complications like cytokine storm and clots in critical organs that were known to follow lung damage that could be killers. I am thankful that I could survive, American virologist Dr. David Katzenstein did not make it in Zimbabwe"
2021-09-18 21:01:32,"We already know the limit of death acceptability on the Right.  When Ebola hit the country during Obama's time, people could wait to isolate the victims, or even exclude them (Americans!) altogether.  There wasn't a vaccine then, but if there was, people would have done anything to get a vaccine to a disease that kills 70-90% of its victims, even in America, in a gruesome, bloody way.
No, it took Trump's politics of polarization to open the door to refusing life-saving vaccines, even though they were developed by Trump under his Operation Warp Speed.  But it took a relatively mild disease - compared to Ebola - to leave the door open to chance, even a bad chance."
2021-09-18 21:02:00,If Covid were ten times deadlier we'd all have a lot more space and YIMBY's would have even less of an argument to eradicate single family zoning than they do now .
2021-09-18 21:08:48,"Would a different death rate have changed the response?
No, because that would be premised on a rational, statistical approach to the pandemic.
What we have seen instead is dismissiveness towards medical and scientific professionals; a premium of business as usual over public health; politicization of masks and vaccines as an infringement of liberty; and a devil may care attitude towards responsibility.
If at least four and a half million deaths worldwide aren’t enough to make some people concerned, then they are beyond persuasion."
2021-09-18 21:09:20,"On February 2, Global air travel is restricted, March 6, a cruise ship is held at sea, March 13, Trump imposes travel ban, March 19, California has a statewide stay-at-home order, May 28th, 100,000 deaths from Covid, if we multiply that by 10, that would be 1 million deaths, at this point the pandemic is primarily in metropolitan areas not rural.
Remember the panic over toilet paper and other commodities. With ten times the death, you would at least have 2 to 3 times more alarm in metropolitan areas, whereas Covid would barely impact the rural, but they would be upset because he couldn't get the commodities they wanted. This would make the divergence between the city folk and country folk immense, add in the fact that the rural is more conservative, and with Trump's rhetoric, January 6 might have been the end of our democracy!"
2021-09-18 21:10:24,"I think a lot of the issue is that most people don't get seriously ill, and we know that, so ideally a vaccine would let us get on with life because it would prevent us from spreading the virus to overweight, elderly, or sick people who ARE likely to get seriously ill. But the vaccine can't do that. Or, supposedly it can, but not well enough that we can stop with the wretched masks and isolation. The vaccine mostly just prevents serious illness - which most people wouldn't experience anyway - so it feels pointless to get it. Clearly, overweight and ill people are still not getting vaccinated and are dying. But, as a vaccinated young, skinny, healthy person, I'm left wondering how I benefit at all from the vaccine. It is exceedingly rare for a person like me to die of covid. Most people who die and are described as ""young and healthy"" are 40 years old and obese. I am not. My state is still under restrictions, and life is as miserable as it was before the vaccine. I got the vaccine because it promised me freedom. This was a false promise."
2021-09-18 21:10:51,"What does Ross say about climate change? How many heat wave, flood, wild fire, hurricane deaths have to happen for the anti-science right to do anything about climate change? Most Americans feel powerless that 600,000 people died but at least most on the left will wear a mask or get a shot to save themselves and others."
2021-09-18 19:58:23,"Here's a case against the Hayes 10x argument. I hope I can explain this clearly. One reason for the tepid reaction by many to Covid is an inability of many (and much of our media) to process uncertainty.  They have the cognitive ability to calculate say 30% of 100, but emotionally they either round up to 1 or down to 0. 

So, Ebola which is highly deadly but only killed 4 Americans is to this group a frightening threat because if you get it you're likely to die. They round up to 1.  While Covid, which will soon top 700,000 US deaths, is not because ""it is like a cold"".  Much of the early discussion that Covid was not severe started with that common base ""but the chance of dying if you get it is low"". That completely ignores how the likelihood of actually being killed is higher. They rounded down to zero, then filtered out all evidence beyond that."
2021-09-18 20:37:17,"""But I’m still not sure Hayes is right about the Covid 10-times-worse scenario being basically identical to this one in its divisions. As bad as the coronavirus has been, most people who get it still come out OK, children are especially unlikely to be hospitalized or die, and deaths are concentrated in a population, the elderly in nursing homes, that (to our shame) we already keep somewhat out of mind.""

On both sides.  Both sides.

2021-09-18 21:01:36,"One of the concepts that helps me to understand the polarized politics in America is ""selective indignation."" The Left was outraged about the four students murdered by National Guard troops at Kent State in 1970, an event which inspired anti-war protests that helped end the Vietnam War. In 2012, the Right flipped out about the four Americans killed by terrorists at Benghazi in Libya and Republican politicians used their politicized outrage in an attempt to blame and destroy Hillary Clinton. In late August, Republicans used the deaths of 13 Marines in Kabul to condemn Joe Biden, but the same Republicans did not condemn Ron DeSantis when 230 citizens of Florida died of Covid on the same day. Some deaths move us to mournfulness, to anger and to political action, and some do not. You can learn a lot about any given American by knowing which deaths are important to that American and which deaths inspire only indifference."

It's a slightly stomach churning reality to accept, but he's likely to be regarded historically as much more of an important and stabilizing statesman than not. See also, the Abraham accords.

Covid-zero is a irritating pipe dream that arrogant doctors have promoted because they think they are God over nature.

So, under these conditions which is better, tearing the bandaid off quickly or tearing it off slowly? That is the preference we are debating. 

Certainly, the unbelievable speed with which a vaccine was created and authorized for use means that in HINDSIGHT, delaying the progress of the virus was a better strategy (granted a lot of immunity came via infection before the vaccine). 

So, all the debate around covid are simply people claiming some control over something that is, fundamentally, uncontrollable.  Worse or better, more death or less death, we'd still have been in the same place because that's where nature put us, not man.

Humility in the face of nature is not something doctors are used to feeling; covid reminds us that nature remains more powerful than any human endeavors."
2021-09-18 21:18:30,"Michael Che of SNL got it right early on.

If CoVid affects -- and kills -- black & brown people disproportionately, it won't even be a fight to contain it.

Since that was the early finding, and then it further morphed into 'overweight' / 'obese' + people of color ... well, then, all bets were off. 

I am grateful, beyond mere words, that it didn't at first, and hopefully, won't evolve further, to overtake kids at the same rate as adults.
I did think, or like to think at least, that, heaven forbid, if kids were afflicted so severely, a la polio in the '50s, etc., there would have been lines begging for the vaccine no matter one's location or political stance.

So it's less the lethality rate overall -- it's WHO it's lethal to.
Sad to say."
2021-09-18 21:20:50,"Very interesting. For one thing, I'm glad COVID-19 wasn't ten times more transmissible or deadly. The deaths as they are, are staggering and so tragic.

In the movie Contagion, far more people died globally from that fictional virus. Society basically breaks down in that movie, so it's good that didn't happen to us, protests and political kerfuffles notwithstanding. 

I really believe in Peter Turchin. He's the UConn biologist/historian who has tracked historical human events much as geologists track million-year Earth events to find patterns, and then predict future outcomes. He predicted 2020 would be tough, and he was right. There is a blog post on his Cliodynamics site that traces periods of instability throughout time and epidemics/pandemics. We have no explanation that passes muster for why these two negative events (social instability and disease) tend to correlate, but even failing an explanation, it would behoove us to make society more stable. Probably the best thing we can do to prepare for a future pandemic besides more medical research is to increase social cohesion. 

I think bacterial pandemics could be the next big problem because antibiotic resistance is a real problem and if temperatures change on Earth, microbiota will evolve. Bacterial life is much more prevalent than human life. We have to put more focus on bacteria-fighting medicines. There has been some promise with macrophages in fighting bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics."
2021-09-18 21:20:54,"I’m not sure that closing schools was a bad idea. I think having them open with the Delta variant spiking might be a terrible idea. The fact is large gatherings of people, many unvaccinated, is not a great idea if you’re trying to control an infectious disease.

Many states don’t even have mask mandates and even vaccinated people can get sick."
2021-09-18 21:23:14,"Closing some schools was not a bad decision. The mistake was in closing schools and businesses on too coarse a scale, such that counties and schools which hadn't experienced much Covid early on, still were closed, either out of misplaced fear or in accord with state-wide orders. The Delta variant has made school operation much more difficult and some have reclosed after teacher deaths or infections of more than a handful of students. Children contracting Covid is far from rare, children becoming hospitalized as a result has become much less rare, children have died -- this is particularly a problem for schools because children under 12 cannot be vaccinated. 

Schools in this area have almost all reopened for in-person learning. Masks are required. Some schools have already been required to close for a wee or two because of Covid spread."
2021-09-18 21:24:20,"Ross always finds some way to justify right-wing outrages. It's an outrage that the Right worked hard to minimize the danger of covid -- not because of ""libertarian"" principles, but because Trump desperately wanted to make it go away and the Right was and is in Trump's pocket. By positing the scenario of covid being ten times worse, he impicitly suggests it wasn't really all that bad. After all, at one in 500 dead, Ross himself lost no one, and it was mostly old people anyway. Don't worry, Ross, we're not finished at 670,000, since nearly 2000 more Americans died yesterday -- largely because following the Right. millions refuse to take the vaccine."
2021-09-18 21:26:56,"If it were 10 times worse, the entire US population would have caught COVID, and 6.5 million Americans would have died. If COVID were Ebola, the fear factor would dominate the ""discussion"" and denialism wouldn't be possible. 

This is what happens when everything is translated into politics - Nothing good, or done quickly, or done well. Just self-serving noises. Any garbage, based on nothing, becomes an ideological shill factory for reasons nothing to do with the public interest. In this case, as so many others, ""libertarian"" is just an excuse for taking a political position. It has nothing to do with facts on any level. 

Politics has no place in health at all. Lockdowns work. In Australia, we don't like lockdowns, but our COVID stats are very low indeed, even with the Delta strain. The real mystery is why America insists on fighting wars with itself over every noun and verb in the language. The babbling, slack response to COVID has made it endemic in the US and around the world, and it was entirely due to politics."
2021-09-18 21:27:30,"Covid will become more than 10 times worse than the Delta variant. It's just a matter of time, since 80+ million eligible people have not gotten jabbed. And who thinks that that number will go down to 20 million in the next 6 months? It's not going to happen. And in the interim the virus will continue to mutate, and a new strain will laugh hysterically at the current vaccines. Covid is here to stay, and the only thing the responsible can do is take all well-known precautions, get boosters when the experts say we should, and subsequent jabs if Big Pharma is able to create new vaccines to deal with the not-too-distant future mutant strain that's as inevitable as the sun rising in the east."
2021-09-18 21:30:42,"Ross, the case fatality rate for SARS in 2003 was 10%--nearly *7 times* higher than the case fatality rate for COVID-19. 

'Only' 8000 people died before the incipient pandemic was snuffed out, principally by the vigorous response of the Vietnamese and Hong Kong public health systems.

It is interesting to consider whether there are viable molecular evolutionary pathways from SARS-CoV-2--the pathogen responsible for the current pandemic--and SARS-CoV-1--the pathogen responsible for the 2003 event.

With 74 million unvaccinated children in the US; face-to-face ubiquitous in schools across the country without plans in place for targeted virtual education in response to outbreaks as are occurring in schools nationwide now; and probably half those children with parents and social circles that have no intention of vaccinating, masking, or participating in any way in measures that promote the common good; my money is on the evolution of a monster variant that scythes through the pediatric population America like nothing ever experienced in this country.

And then--?"
2021-09-18 21:31:31,"1.Ross speaks as if all the efforts to contain it haven't happened. And the number of people dead and seriously ill would be pretty much where it is now.
2. If Trump wasn't Trump but was Trump what might have he done if he acted differently then he  was capable of acting how would that impact how people would respond to an imagined situation that in no way was possible to happen."
2021-09-18 21:33:14,"As a tool of analysis this counterfactual seems contrived and worthless. Ross Douthat’s recent columns are valuable not for their content, but because they provoke so many excellent comments (there are few enough at this point to read them al). 

To them I will add only one thing, which is consistent with the other comments: I am an MD and of course have patients who are Republicans and Democrats. I have numerous Democratic friends and a smaller number of Republican ones. Almost all of my patients and friends are vaccinated. 

I have not seen the slightest evidence — none — that those who are vaccinated or willingly wear masks do so as a political statement. They simply don’t want to contract COVID or to transmit it. Beginning and end of story."
2021-09-18 21:33:59,"Trump is alive because he had a team of doctors who saved him, injecting him with everything they had in their arsenal. Trump had, in essence, the resources of the people, the taxes paying for socialized medicine. The man paid not one cent for his treatment. Let us not forget that the man with a significant share of the responsibility for those 670,000 dead and millions of infected is alive because his doctors took seriously what he, the president of the United States, did not and still does not."
2021-09-18 21:38:10,"Too many people on the earth.  There will be more pandemics, more lethal ones.   

Remember the old experiments with guppies?  Into one tank two of them were placed.  Into the other tank dozens and dozens were placed.

A year later?  Both tanks had the same number of guppies.

The earth is an aquarium.  It has a set number of people it can sustain.  We are far over that.  A pandemic will be nature's way of correcting for our overpopulation."
2021-09-18 21:39:41,"""most people who get it still come out OK, children are especially unlikely to be hospitalized or die, and deaths are concentrated in a population, the elderly in nursing homes, that (to our shame) we already keep somewhat out of mind.""

Young people and children are dying from the Delta variant not just those in nursing homes.  Almost 25% of those who get COVID suffer from some long term problems including children.  How many of those will not recover and require some form of disability payments to survive?

But, the more important topic Mr. Douthat failed to mention is how neglecting to get vaccinated and wear masks is taking down our health care systems across the country, with doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, EMT's and so many others getting PTSD from the stress of working long hours, seeing so much death and not seeing an end in sight.  Many have left the profession altogether and we now have over 3 million openings for nurses in the US.

Hospitals are now rationing care in many states and if you have a car accident, heart attack or other health problem, you will not get an ICU bed as they are full of anti-vaxxers who refuse to believe the science.  Many Republican governors continue to cheer on COVID with no mask mandates.  Where is the light at the end of the tunnel?"
2021-09-18 21:51:02,"It is an uncomfortable thought that we are being ""trained"" to accept injections of foreign substances at a moments notice but that is the apparent tradeoff we've been approaching. The responses of communities to pandemics are being baked in right now, so when the next one rolls around, no matter how deadly, the reactions will be predictable. People who accustomed themselves to being vaccinated, will shrug, grumble, and queue up for yet another shot, the remainder will wave the flag, the Bible, and die."
2021-09-18 21:52:30,"Ross, you observe,  And since the one thing we don’t seem to be doing yet is preparing for the next pandemic, my fear is that within the next 20 years we’ll encounter an invisible enemy...""  We prepared for this pandemic, in fact we put huge planning into how to manage these disease outbreaks starting in the early 2,000's.  The impetus for this initiative came from then President Bush, who saw the need to prepare, and demonstrated really able leadership in driving the planning forward.  The ""Red Book"", the respsones plan for all that, was mostly left on the shelf when COVID hit.  Not an invisible enemy any more, it was Donald Trump and the anti-science wing of the GOP that tossed all that good work, and saw perverse political advantage in adopting a pro-COVID campaign platform.  Only the GOP can fix the GOP.  How about writing about that?  Our pandemic response is an apt case study in how a political party can move from prescient and able (Bush and pandemics) to craven and cyncial, the GOP we have today."
2021-09-18 21:56:13,"Yeah...no.
I think that you're ignoring/missing the point that a significant number of the right actually believes in some really bsc stuff. Potentially over reacting on the left is more like erring on the side of caution. 
An over abundance of caution is not comparable to denial of reality."
2021-09-18 21:58:00,"The climate crisis is making the covid pandemic look small in comparison. So many illnesses and deaths can be tied to climate change like ones from heat waves, floods, chronic diseases like asthma exacerbated by wildfire smoke, Lyme disease from increased ticks, and on and on. And then there is the increase in refugees, many of whom would go hungry if they stayed where they were because of drought.

And yet we, the human species, are not doing much to address and mitigate the climate crisis as much as we can, while we still can.

Sure, Democrats are doing more than Republicans when it comes to addressing climate change. But not nearly enough.

As the Swedish teenaged climate activist Greta Thunberg says ""we must treat this climate crisis like a crisis."""
2021-09-18 22:00:18,In order for the right to stay the course on denying climate science they have to stay the course on denying all science. Opening the door to trusting covid science might have the unintended consequence of their constituents having to believe - and do something - about climate change. Unfortunately being free to deny science comes at cost. Then again so does following covid and climate science.
2021-09-18 22:00:35,"Here in Alabama we have a growing number of pregnant women hospitalized/died ( others on ventilators) with a higher than expected fetal losses and stillbirths. This is almost exclusively among the unvaccinated. Should not the leaders of the evangelical churches be calling for all their followers to get vaccinated to protect the fetus, Ross."
2021-09-18 22:00:37,"Interesting column, always like reading Ross Douthat's take on things even if I don't really agree with them. 

One important counterpoint to the counterfactual of COVID being an order of magnitude deadler:

COVID is somewhat special in that it is virulent enough to kill a lot of older and vulnerable people, yet not so virulent that it reliably gives healthy people symptoms, and yet is highly transmissible regardless.  Compare to something that is not one but two orders of magnitude deadlier, like Ebola or Smallpox, which tend to make even healthy people clearly sick quite quickly, yet we have historically been able to contain them.  So one reason it's such an effective political scissor is it's also an epidemiological scissor."
2021-09-18 22:06:20,"I've got news for Mr. Douthat.  Many conservatives may have downplayed the pandemic because of some early prognosticators who got the death toll all wrong.  However, they're still shamefully continuing to toy with this health emergency to this very day.  

This is because it aligns with the larger GOP narrative of opposing everything the current Democratic president is doing to end the scourge.  By refusing to institute mask mandates, stressing ""freedom of choice"" regarding vaccines, and lining up against vaccine requirements for jobs etc., many GOP governors and their social media allies have chosen a cynical route that has left almost 700K Americans dead. 

Whether it's fealty to the last president, or some odd strategic notion that sacrificing their own citizens will make them look strong and principled, it wouldn't matter if the toll were 100X larger.  This is the avenue the GOP has chosen to address an urgent health crisis.  And by so stubbornly refusing to do the right thing, these folks have abandoned all  credibility in the fight.  Worse, this shows no signs of abating anytime soon.

So let's hope we don't ever have another pandemic that's 10 times as bad.  The GOP will be missing in action on that one too.  And woe be it to the rest of us in this country."
2021-09-18 22:07:59,"Let's remember that many hospitals in several states were and are overflowing, which is both a dangerous situation and an unethical one.  Health care workers were in risk and highly stressed, and the long haul disease impacts hardly known.   Given these realities, many Republicans were still not really moved by the pandemic's rise.

So it could be argued that the situation was as bad as - and even worse - than we could handle as it evolved.  Multiply it by 10 and it would have been crazy in numerous more hospitals and places.  If 10s of thousands of long-haulers are severely impacted by the disease, that is an added stress on our medical costs - as well as their compromised lives.

There should have been teacher vaccinations as a top priority that might have lessened re-opening of school fears, but imagine if one or more students died of COVID and what that would do to parental anxiety and further closings.

10X the deaths would have likely scared some Republicans, but it's hard to know how much due to their libertarian bias, their God bias (""If it's time to go the lord has his plans and we have to accept it""), and their desire for maintaining political power with Trump at the helm."
2021-09-18 22:11:47,"Mr. Douthat, you write: ""whether there’s a world where Donald Trump went all-in for strict disease-fighting measures and liberals turned anti-lockdown in response, or one where Trump won re-election and hesitation over the 'Trump vaccine' ended up stronger on the left.""

If this is how you characterize liberals and the left, perhaps you do not understand liberal viewpoints. We are pro-science. Had Trump supported stronger pandemic-fighting measures, you would have heard many of us praising them. Likewise, you never heard liberals complaining about Operation Warp Speed (for vaccine development), one legitimate development in his Administration. If only the right could be as reasonable in understanding sensible policies to fight the pandemic, instead of blindly taking the opposite side of what a Democratic Administration recommends."
2021-09-18 22:11:59,"The media COVID and the personal COVID divide is absolutely massive and this is something I realized early on in the pandemic when I contracted it during ""necessary"" labor.

I had COVID and so did at least 5 of my close acquaintances and our ""illnesses"" ranged from zero symptoms and feeling perfectly fine to having a runny nose and a slight cough.

I've joked among friends that getting COVID was like a free paid 2 weeks vacation with antibodies to boot (how long these last, I don't know, but I haven't been sick since testing positive more than a year ago)."
2021-09-18 22:12:22,"I don’t understand the point of this what-if especially since there is no mention of the consequence of a truly lethal virus.  If a virus kills everyone who has it, doesn’t it essentially stop itself because there are no hosts in which it can replicate? Of course, it seems logical that the best thing for the virus is to become less deadly and more contagious."
2021-09-18 22:12:53,The former guy often bragged about how quickly he got us the vaccine and yet his followers seem to be the ones reluctant to get it. It is like the dog who bites the hand that feeds it. Modern medicine saved us from a much worse situation. Yes there were thousands of deaths but dedicated people and advanced medicine saved many more .Yet it is the healthcare professionals who have been harassed at their homes and been fired by government officials for being too vocal. Next time we might not be so lucky as in the end many have learned little from this go around with a deadly virus.
2021-09-18 22:22:41,"I am appalled at the apparent acceptability of 670,000 deaths and that we closed schools to early. How is this writer poised to decide who and how many should die? I am 70 and a cancer patient. What is the verdict for me? Better yet, who decides what the risk is I must accept?

This is nonsensical hair-splitting to once again make the alleged party of life not come off as the party of death. I still have hopes for life. But if I am one of the writer's one in 500, should I just lie down, roll over and play dead for him?

I have a better insight for the naive Mr. Douthat who believes that libertarianism is genuine. Since Nixon, the GOP came to realize that white, blue collar New Dealers were also socially conservative. And that by at first pressing the case for law and order, we wound up at white replacement theory. We also went from a two party system to one party being portrayed as evil and that experts and statesmen were no longer to be trusted. The GOP became the party of only we can save you.  And since masks and closings were Democratic ideas, they had to be tyranny and opposed. And once Trump was gone, after getting vaccines developed, they too were added to this list of despotic imposition so that swallowing disinfectant and horse medicine became badges of loyalty so Biden cannot succeed. Once again Mr. Douthat thinks he can add nobility like perfume to a stink that will not go away."
2021-09-18 22:25:27,"""Today it’s clear that the public-health authorities got all kinds of things wrong, and many bad decisions — especially about closing schools — were made in an atmosphere of panic.""

2021-09-18 22:29:38,"I freely admit that if Trump had won, I would've probably waited a few extra months to get vaccinated.  What's so weird about being concerned about a vaccine pushed through by people beholden to a megalomaniac whose only concern was keeping power?  Yes, Ross, there always politics involved."
2021-09-18 22:33:11,"Were COVID ten times more deadly, the impact on GOP voters would be great enough to easily sway elections. It's sad commentary, but it would likely mean conservatives supporting the vaccine much more than they do now."
2021-09-18 22:38:40,"It's odd - perhaps not surprising, but odd - that disease is politicized in the first place, as though it were a lifestyle choice, or viral infections were liberal, or being unnecessarily dead was patriotic, in the partisan sense. 

Why this is so apparently has everything to do with politicians and their masters who are perfectly adept at separating normal Americans from their common sense, and deftly substituting cultish behavior for self-preservation.  Note this was exclusively GOP driven (with ample help from Moscow's troll farms); there is no equivalent liberal effort. Enforcing mandates for masks, vaccines and public mingling may be authoritarian, but as Orwell succinctly noted, authoritarianism fits all parties equally. 

And to be honest, its revealing that folks who have had zero problem ensuring their young meet vaccination mandates for polio and diphtheria suddenly spout libertarian drivel about Covid, which has been far more lethal.  The difference?  Volumes of propaganda and pretzel posturing from the right. 

I imagine the better hypothetical here would be to imagine an alien parasite appeared from space. Based on the evidence, it's highly likely the GOP would welcome it heartily - so long as they got to keep their jobs."
2021-09-18 22:39:59,"I'm not sure I understand the comment about schools closing being a bad decision.  Sure, when schools reopened with other mitigation strategies in place, there was no major spreading events.  But look at what has happened in those places where schools are open with no mitigation strategies.  The virus is continuing to circulate through the schools and back into the community.  Granted, severe childhood illness is still thankfully somewhat rare, but unmasked hordes of students sitting in poorly ventilated, crammed quarters, is keeping the virus going. 

Schools weren't closed to protect children, they were closed to stop the spread.  I highly suggest reading Michael Lewis's book for further explanation of why public health experts chose that line defense when things first went haywire."
2021-09-18 22:40:05,The rate of paralysis in people who contracted the polio virus (prior to the availability of the polio vaccine) was 1 in 1000.  It is the many minimally affected carriers of a viral infection that allow it to  proliferate and cause such widespread damage in a population.

The climate catastrophe, which is starting to accumulate its own body count, is fast on the heels of a virus we can’t shake. Just when we most need a reservoir of trust in public institutions that are meant to keep us safe, we are torn apart by our own inhumanity. It’s time to face Truth and meet the moment. This pandemic has taught us how difficult a path we have ahead."
2021-09-18 22:41:26,"Michael Osterholm went on the Joe Rogan podcast in February of 2020 and predicted 400,000 to 600,000 deaths. He also said hand washing (remember that?) was a waste of time - the disease was airborne. Looking for political angles is ok, I guess, but the pandemic has panned-out more or less as expected. The deaths have probably been held down by the lockdowns, but not by much. If it had happened 30 years ago we would have all masked-up and gone to work.

The danger is the next wave. The asymptomatic characteristics of the spreaders make this thing essentially impossible to wipe out, and each variant has the potential to be much more deadly. The third wave of the Spanish flu did most of the killing."
2021-09-18 22:41:56,"The mortality rate in America for the Spanish flu of 1918-19 was 675,000.  There were no effective vaccines to fight it, as the science of vaccines was in its infancy.  Mr. Douthat reports that 670,000 Americans have died from Covid thus far.  Since we have had a vaccine for nearly a year, a good number of these deaths were preventable.  In 1918 Woodrow Wilson was not particularly concerned about the disease since he had a war to make ""the world safe for democracy"" to win.  That was then. This is now.  We will soon have a higher death toll than 1918-19 not because we ignored the problem, as Wilson did, but because we politicized it.  Instead of the Coronavirus pandemic unifying the country, it has divided us.  And it has divided us because the pandemic itself has been exploited by both politicians and the media.  The reason for the exploitation:  profit."
2021-09-18 22:43:30,"We should be talking more about preparing for the next pandemic, and recent history is very instructive on this one.

With H1N , we dodged a bullet, but the Obama administration made significant, forward looking investments in the development of MRNA vaccine technology to ""prepare for the next one"". 

What most people don't realize is that Covid 19 is strictly in the SARS family (Its official name is SARS CoV 19), and we had a big head start with prior infections in 2003 in identifying the relevant spike protein, and those were part of the institutional memory of the CDC and the ongoing vaccine work.

In May 2018, President Trump disbanded the White House Pandemic Response Team; and in July, 2019 The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency left the post, and the Trump Administration eliminated the role.

Past is prologue."

And conservatives were eager to believe them.

Dear, dear, Ross, you are someone who puts faith in belief. It's not about belief. It's about Science. Science does not care what you believe.

Covid isn't over. There are currently more than 1,950 people dying every day, and it's not going to just magically go away.  We do not know what the eventual 1 in 500 will turn in to, but it will not go down."
2021-09-18 22:45:03,"It's really simple.  Had the right wing been so noisy in past years, we would still be fighting smallpox and polio because large numbers of the population are asserting their freedom to deny vaccines.

Douthat tries to wrap it in analytical terms, but it's ultimately the belief that my personal preference should overrule clear public health needs that is perpetuating this pandemic.  We have a clear path toward beating the virus down but we don't have the public will to get it done because of decades of right wing propaganda."
2021-09-18 22:46:05,"We just had a death of a 13 year old healthy and active child in Wisconsin, due to Covid. The school decided to now implement mask guidelines in that school.

And yet there are protests at this school?

Go figure. 

I guess protecting a fetus only applies until birth?

The numbers of deaths are at least 10 to 15% below realities.

If you look at average amount of deaths for the last 10 years, our death numbers just in the U.S. alone are about 14.5% higher for 2020 and about 17% so far for 2021.

I know 3 close family/friends who have died from Covid. Of the 3 that have died, 2 were in their 40s and relatively healthy and active. 

In addition, I have 4 close family/friends with long haul problems. Of the 4 with long haul problems, 2 were healthy/active.

I'm not sure how big Mr. Douthat's circle of friends/family is, but I am surprised he has been spared from a close family/friend from this terrible pandemic.

I think if politicians on the right would have embraced sensible guidelines and vaccines, we would have had about half the suffering."

We will likely find out.

At least as long as such a high percentage of the Right is determined to act as petri dishes for variants and finds demonizing public health officials entertainment.  Perhaps not with Covid, but with the next pandemic. Or the one after that. 

While I applaud the conservative media for finally taking the problem of overpopulation seriously, even going so far as to encourage their base to volunteer for an early exit, there are better ways to deal with both deadly viruses and overpopulation. 

But I guess that's what happens when a party becomes little more than an aggrieved nihilist death cult."
2021-09-18 22:48:05,"The real problem will be the next pandemic. There are many pathogens worse than Covid-19, both more contagious and more lethal. It’s not a matter of if but when. If the public health response continues to be politicized, Covid will look like a minor inconvenience."

2021-09-18 22:49:27,"10x worse Covid wouldn't unify the country. America is divided and will remain so for decades. There is a long poeriod of political turbulence ahead. But it would be a dose of reality for the delusional right, and enough to make them change their minds on this one particular issue. 

But also, an additional 5 million deaths would be a heavy price just to get the nuttier part of the population to calm down a little, so we are fortunate that Covid has not been worse than it already is."
2021-09-18 22:53:06,"“ Today it’s clear that the public-health authorities got all kinds of things wrong, and many bad decisions— especially about closing schools—were made in an atmosphere of panic”
No Ross those decisions were made in an atmosphere of prudence at a time when so much was unknown and uncertain. Monday morning QBing now looks prescient though we’ve also learned that kids aren’t free from risk.
Panic describes our response after 9/11 when 3000 people died, I hardly think when an equal number were dieting daily constitutes panic."
2021-09-18 22:57:06,"Conservatives always align themselves to protect the assets of the 1%. 

While ""freedom"" is a conservative theme, so are ""duty"" and ""sacrifice"". So why did the ball roll to the ""freedom"" side of the conservative response?

The primary justification for taxing rich people is to provide some type of service that is good for everyone--the social contract. 

If you eliminate or undermine the social contract, then you remove the primary rationale for taxing rich people. 

Freedom of choice is just a term that atomizes responsibility to the individual level. And if everyone has a choice, then there's no need for government programs. And, no need to tax rich people. 

The current policies of laws against mask mandates and feeding people doubt about the efficacy of vaccines is undermining two the largest parts of the social contract: public health and public education. 

By eroding faith in public health and the public education system, and making these environments frustrating and contentious, they are undermining the social contract. 

Conservatives would love to eliminate public schools in favor of private charter schools. They would also like to end all subsidies for public health and just have everyone buy their own private insurance. 

People don't want to pay taxes for services that aren't meeting their needs. 

I'd say the conservative anti-vax, anti-mask response is doing exactly what it was meant to do--undermine the social contract and remove reasons to tax the rich."
2021-09-18 22:58:13,"If COVID were 10 times deadlier then it would actually be dangerous for healthy, normal weight, non-elderly people. And the response would definitely be different."
2021-09-18 22:59:16,"If covid-19 were ten times as deadly, anti-vaxxers would be extinct and consequently no longer spreading disinformation, attacking anyone pushing for mandates or masks. or hoarding essential PPE.   It might even be that the top people in the Trump administration, including Trump himself, would have died by the middle of 2020 as a consequence of their ridiculous refusal to admit there was a pandemic. 
     
But some other effects worth considering when we prepare for the inevitable next pandemic:
1 - There might not have been time to develop the vaccines.
2 - The vaccine developers might have fallen victim to covid-19 before their work was complete
3 - There might not have been time to properly test the vaccines.
4 - There might not have been time to do a roll-out of the vaccines.
5 - The food shortages due to crippling of the supply chain would have been far more serious.
6 - There would have been far fewer people to maintain our infrastructure, repair outages, respond to weather emergencies or staff hospitals.
     
All in all, the nightmare we would have experienced would have been truly apocalyptic."

2021-09-18 23:05:23,"This country is set in concrete, regarding its divisions. It would be useful to stop picking at the gigantic scab. Nothing will change. Not now, not ever. Social media has had a large hand in showing us the divides and permitting us to spend all day, every day, posting about how much we hate one another. A prime reason things are not completely intolerable is because Twitter pulled up the bridge over the moat. Too late, but at least it happened. And in terms of the pandemic, only mandatory barring of the unvaccinated will bring any relief."
2021-09-18 21:30:53,"I sort of wonder how Ross comes out on these cases. I mean I know if it was a matter of forcing his faith down our throats or reafirming the white nationalist identity he is totally ok with a strong ethno-state. If it is a matter of saving lives, protecting the environment, or providing for the poor then he rushes over to Paul Ryan libertarianism. So which way, populist or libertarian to go for public health? Note that he never really gives his position on the conspiracist fiasco we are seeing througout the South in the actual world. But then I guess he could see all this fantasy as one more expression of the ""good sense"" celebrated in Hillbillie Elegy. It's just luck his family doesn't have to spend time with this ""salt of the earth"""

At that level, no supermarket manager could say he didn't know anyone who had died of COVID and so he didn't need to impose mask rules on employees or customers (before vaccines). The 'political' problem with this pandemic is too much good health and nutrition, too many empathetic Americans who care for others and so are careful about what they do, and too capable a medical system saving too many victims of the disease. One in 50 would still not scare the daylights out of the willfully ignorant. Even one in 10 might not be enough. At least now, we have most deaths by far among the unvaccinated. But strangely, even that is only driving some anti-vaxxers to take chemically prepared antibodies instead of depending on their own immune systems to make them after prompting by a vaccine. Perhaps we should see what happens if the price of those skyrockets."
2021-09-18 22:22:48,"Death sharpens the mind. People with blunt minds die. If Covid had a mortality rate akin to small pox (10-50%), some Republican states would turn Democratic because they would outnumber the remaining Republicans. Furthermore, survivors of small pox generally had terrible quality of life and chronic health consequences. Aside from a small pox survivor being ugly because of all the pox scars, many would be blind and/or suffer from connective tissue morbidity that tends to diminish range of motion, leaving survivors disabled."
2021-09-18 19:44:15,"How about this. Covid is already probably very close to 10 times worse than it needed to be simply because of the previous president’s narcissism, making everything including the virus about him and his quest for reelection.  Lying to Americans about the lethality; undermining testing and contact tracing; and finally, politicizing masking up and vaccinations to the point that eight months after he’s gone, hopefully forever, America is still in the grips of the confusion he manufactured every time he spoke."

No other country on the planet has seen a similar death rate but the unvaccinated, who are for the most part Republican voters, continue to deny medical & scientific advice. 
The question that people like Mr Douthat and his GOP cohorts must answer is how many people must die before you guys take Covid-19 seriously?"
2021-09-18 22:29:03,"Well Ross, I guess there are some real life tests of this question: some counties are now approaching 1 in 100 dead subsequent to the delta wave. Any guess where they are? Why not ask them?"

Even if a Republican president was the one to lead in disease-fighting, Democrats would be grateful for that. Not resistant. This false equivalency between the increasingly irrational and hostile conservative faction and the imagined behavior of liberals is insulting."
2021-09-18 23:11:53,"Let me assure everyone who is willing to listen that if 650k children died rather than mostly seniors that it would make what we are going through look like a garden party.

2021-09-18 23:14:30,"Perhaps some of our divisions are not as ideological as they seem.
   For instance, in the first six or nine months of the pandemic the rural-ish, more conservative, red parts of the nation were almost completely spared. No one around them was sick, no one was dying and the hospitals were quiet. But throughout that time all they heard were the coastal ""elites"" telling them that they had to run and hide, cover their faces, close their schools and businesses and abandon their grandma for her own sake. And these ""elites"" have real power over the rurals, down to which pronouns to use, what to call their favorite teams, what vehicle to drive...
   By the time it was their turn to suffer the disease (historically, pandemics start in big port cities and spread out to the countryside) the bad attitudes on both sides were set in concrete.
   It would have been better if my fellow liberals, so well educated and so woke, had been a little more aware of the variety of life experience across the country and much less hateful and insulting."
2021-09-18 23:25:13,"This column is an excellent example of why the trust in public health authorities is at an all time low. In one sentence he mentions a few epidemiologists that got the prediction wrong, then expands those wrong predictions to ""public health authorities"" Then says the health authorities got it right. Then Ross says that closing the schools was a mistake, forgetting that before the vaccination we were putting many of our teachers at risk of dying from this disease. We made the right choice on schools before the vaccinations. I had skin in the game. I quit my job to teach my children remotely. My job was not worth the life of one of my children's teachers, and I feel like I served my country and my fellow citizens through this horrible time."
2021-09-18 23:29:25,"Whoa Douthat! Do you seriously think the pandemic is close to over?  That's more than a little premature. There are no vacant ICU beds in many places. Your death count is already behind. This instant the Johns-Hopkins dashboard reads 673,441 dead, not 670,000. 

Until the case rates go down globally, more variants are likely and we don't know what they will do. 

We passed 1 in 500 dead. If more people do not start taking this thing seriously, we'll pass 1 in 250 dead and not having anyone close having died will become very rare."
2021-09-18 23:29:50,"Unfortunately, from a behavioral epidemiology standpoint, it might not have made much of a difference.  While some of the messaging certainly played a role in peoples' beliefs/actions, we need to consider that COVID was a novel virus - one which has since mutated multiple times.   

A more conservative approach upfront may have saved lives and reduced mutations. At the same time, COVID fatigue might have settled in somewhat sooner - just in time for the more virulent strains. 

Most Americans have little to no exposure to public health measures.  SARs, Ebola, West Nile and Zika - didn't require population-level interventions to prevent spread in the US. 

Fear of HIV exposure resulted in more widespread use of public health measures, although not consistently across different populations.   Unfortunately, as HIV became ""manageable"", transmission protection rates tended to fall, particularly in younger MSM.

We could have done better, but it is unlikely that as citizens, we would have been perfect."
2021-09-18 23:29:55,I think I agree with Hayes that a more lethal Covid wouldn’t have changed the politics much.  If he is right about this the country has major problems that need to be swiftly addressed

I'm a boomer and though my generation was hit pretty hard, it's basically our parents and those with comorbidities who were hit really hard.

2021-09-18 23:36:20,"Understanding the point of this article, there's another point to be made from the article's question.  The point being that the current COVID-19 pandemic is just an initial PRACTICE run.  There's no scientific-based article I have yet to read that has indicated that the virus could not have been 10 times, or even 50 times deadlier, and also kill children equally.  If the virus had been 10 times deadlier we'd probably be looking at mass graves and an economic recession.  At 50 times, we'd be looking at a total collapse of the economy, and maybe even the government.  It's imperative that we LEARN from the COVID-19 pandemic, and be ready for when the virus that threatens modern civilization does arrive.  It's not a matter of IF this will ever happen, but WHEN."
2021-09-18 23:36:49,"I've been saying this since the beginning.  Most people still don't think covid necessitates the measures we put in place.  And, in most cases they are right.  Most people are unharmed and don't die.  The measures we put in place protect fat people and the elderly.  Which, considering this is America, is a large portion of the population."

As long as the tobacco industry is allowed to exist, that is believable."
2021-09-18 23:39:21,"Chris Hayes of MSNBC is right because the right-wing is successful in lowering expectations of safety and well-being. The right does very little to end an ongoing tragedy. Instead, it successfully convinces Americans to believe that increasing suffering is the new normal. 

Like the pandemic, the tragedy of gun violence is a product of this wilful negligence. The massive death toll of the past decades was met with callousness and efforts to make guns more accessible. Americans were made to believe that gun-related deaths are normal and inevitable. The powerful right will never accept the premise that the availability of guns bears any responsibility for a tragedy that has no foreseeable end to it.

Using a twisted interpretation of individual rights as an excuse, the right allows public tragedies to continue - in the hope they will not be personally affected."
2021-09-18 23:42:38,Seems like endless articles about what ifs. How about one where if 1 in 5 people died then we would likely not have a housing crisis and perhaps  be out in front of our climate change goals. Admittedly no one would really know how any of it would pan out as way too many variables to factor in.  Would essentially losing 2 billion people on the planet in the short term be positive for the species in the long run?
2021-09-18 23:49:53,"If the death count were at 6.7 million and counting, (albeit slower since the vaccines became available), we would not be having any political debate at all.  Everyone would be hunkered down waiting for deliveries of food, water, etc. from people outfitted in Hazmat suits.  A cadre of health care workers would be pressed into service as door to door vaccine administrators.  Our lives would be completely on hold until 90% or more of the population was vaccinated.  And I really don't think anyone would be resistant in the least to getting the shots."

2021-09-18 23:51:44,"I’ve said this before, but if COVID caused gross deformity like leprosy, or made your hair and teeth fall out, then I think there would be a more universal demand for a vaccine. I guess we’ll just have to wait for the next variant…."
2021-09-18 23:55:44,"Of all Mr. Douthat’s often well written opinion pieces which I have read today’s is perhaps the most “through a glass darkly” in concept.  If it is not in fact the leader, then surely it must be a close contender.

Hollywood and Netflix show astronauts talking to each other over interplanetary separations, with no delay for the signals to travel vast distances, much like we talk on our cell phones here on Mother Earth.  This suggests that Mr. Musk and NASA, only a dozen years hence, have discovered and used new physics that replaces present physics with its full century of success.  This has entertainment value and not analytic value.  It is unphysical and requires suspending belief in reality.

Mr. Douthat today, for one cornerstone example, postulates: “…a world where Donald Trump went all-in for strict disease-fighting…”.  

In short, this is unphysical but with little entertainment value.  It is so against the laws of physics that it has no argumentative value.  Even a Jesuit would not propose this as a so-called “counterfactual” for fear of ridicule."
2021-09-18 23:58:41,"It astounds me how unaware my fellow Democrats are of the age skew of the virus. The difference of risk between the elderly and children is a thousandfold, and yet so many of my friends are treating their kids as if they have the same risk level as their grandparents. Kids are safer than even vaccinated adults!

Europe understands this, but we don’t— and we usually look up to Europe. It’s baffling and really shows the grip of partisanship and ideology in shaping our responses. 

If Republicans let their kids live normal lives, we just can’t do the same."
2021-09-18 23:59:20,"Douthat looks at a 10-times greater death rate through political eyes.

Let’s look instead at economic and logistic issues.

In Spring 2020, the US ran short of many commodities but food, utilities and fuel still got to people. It was tricky, but we muddled through. Now imagine a 10 times worse disease - we might have much worse problems. Food might not always get to every store.

Our healthcare system has been stressed near to collapse at times. With a 10x death rate, it would collapse. People would die on sidewalks outside hospitals, either of covid or regular medical emergencies. 

A collapsing healthcare system would lead to an even higher mortality rate. People who would otherwise survive now die because there are no oxygen tanks left.

Logistically, the US may be the most flexible country in the world. On the other hand, our supply chains are so very complex. I suspect that a simpler 19th century economy might weather 10x lethality with less famine; folks’ food and fuel (wood and coal) were mostly sourced locally.

COVID-19 should be viewed as a practice test. Something worse will come.  

MERS and SARS were both more lethal coronaviruses (20x worse) that killed 1000s. Both were barely stopped on the brink of a global outbreak."
2021-09-19 00:02:26,"Ultimately, the argument is over an individual's right to gamble.  The problem of course is that other people are at risk if you decide to roll the dice.  There is something to this argument, like the person who skips the flu shot each year and seems none the worse for it.  But where there can be no argument is in taking medical guidance from those who know nothing.  Whatever you think of Mike Pence, his qualifications to even express an opinion on the virus, are nonexistant.  To make matters worse, he was a politician running for re-election."
2021-09-19 00:04:13,"As serious and deadly as Covid has been and continues to be, it is orders of magnitude lower in impact than the 1918 flu, which was especially deadly for the young and healthy.  I wonder how we would respond if something similar were to occur in our own time. As poisonously polarized as our country is now, I expect our response would be similar to what we are experiencing now:  endless bickering, blaming, and politicizing with an absence if common purpose and no caring for one another."
2021-09-19 00:05:21,It doesn't matter how the politics and its consequences might have played out if the pandemic had been ten times more or less catastrophic. What matters is what actually happened and what is happening. Playing the counterfactuals game is useful only for escaping responsibility for terrible leadership on the GOP side.
2021-09-19 00:06:13,"The other real danger is that terrorists now are even more alerted to the possibility of using biological warfare. A series of past studies looked at this issue, for example the exercise Dark Winter and Project Baccus are two famous examples. Natural diseases are a threat but so is biological warfare. Now recent advances in molecular genetics make it feasible for a relatively small terrorist group such as Aum Shinrikyo, which attempted a biological warfare attack unsuccessfully, to manufacture a new highly contagious and virulent disease. The threat is real and extremely dangerous. We urgently need to greatly increase R&D for vaccine development and fund manufacturing preparations with factories and trained people  ready. A year lead time is much too long, most of humanity could be dead by then. We need to be able to mass produce a new effective vaccine within weeks to months and we need a system in place to shut down all international travel at a moments notice so as to have the necessary time."
2021-09-19 00:11:48,"None of this theorizing changes the unprecedented obstinance, selfishness and brazen disregard for their fellow citizens and the real social, economic and practical security of our country in this lifetime.  

Trump played it like it was a personal PR problem concocted by his ""enemies.""  The terrified-of-its-base GOP followed his lead, with all of its propaganda arms boosting this mentality.  In a way, this was a virus of its own, of the mind.

There was no call to action.  No mitigation strategy.  No testing, no call to duty.  Instead only dismissive denial that led to a catastrophic death toll and staggering economic loss, coupled with a calculated campaign to undermine and silence the very experts and systems we have in place to fight such a thing.  It's a scandal for the ages and certainly one of the darkest episodes in all of American history, playing alongside breathtaking extrajudicial police action(s) and culminating in an insurrection.

In the early days many GOP leaders were dismissive of the most vulnerable, since they were believed to only be the elderly.  At what point does the sliding scale warrant action?  70?  60?  50?  Talk about a death panel.

How the GOP isn't running screaming from Trump right now is anyone's guess.  How he is not limited to being friends only with OJ Simpson, across all of humanity, is another."
2021-09-19 00:16:15,"What is your point? It is clear:  The vast majority of Republicans believe the BIG LIE that Trump won, they won't get vaccinated but most are happy to get monoclonals, which are much more expensive and after-the-fact, and not as effective, and don't protect your neighbors, don't believe climate change is real here and an existential threat (they will but it will be way too late), do believe anything their Trump Tribe believes, are anti-science, and a serious danger to our democracy."
2021-09-19 00:16:29,"Dont know why you think this will happen in 20 years. The COVID virus has already gone through about 8 significant mutations. The likelihood of a far more deadlier variant turning up and which is able to sidestep the vacccine, is very high."
2021-09-19 00:20:53,"Articles like this would be improved by some math.

Say Covid is 100% fatal, the vaccine is 90% effective, and 70% of the population is vaccinated.

So of every 1,000 people exposed, 300 of the unvaccinated will die. Of the vaccinated, 70 will die.

So you could argue that gosh, 20% of the dead were vaccinated.  

Or say Covid is only 10% fatal. Of 1,000 people exposed, 30 unvaccinated die, and call it 1 vaccinated person dies. 

So you could still argue that 3% of vaccinated people die.

Or you could say if you are vaccinated, your chance of dying is less than .1%, and if unvaccinated your chance of dying is  30 times more."
2021-09-19 00:21:47,"If the pandemic had been 10 times worse, there wouldn't be so much division.  In no way could hospitals have coped with this which would have caused, I think, the vast majority of people to understand the need for public health intervention.  We simply wouldn't have had enough hospital beds to deal with this.   Look at Idaho right now, for instance."
2021-09-19 00:27:18,"I just love Douthat characterizing the Republicans who remain intransigent about COVID vaccination as ""taking the libertarian side.""  As if there were actually a principled political objection to getting vaccinated.  This is the apex of politicizing an issue that simply cannot, in all honesty, be politicized.  Truth is important, but Republicans no longer believe it.  And the reason they do not believe it is that they know they cannot win a majority in the Senate, or win the White House, unless they constantly lie and dissemble. Thus even a smart and ostensibly objective observer such as Douthat stoops to use the shameful rhetoric of his party."
2021-09-19 00:27:25,"Two things are important to considerwhen dealing with these counterfactual scenarios:
1. When delta arrived, which is magnitudes more contagious, a lot more people started taking this seriously on the right. Vaccinations have gone up a lot since the arrival of Delta.So there is an actual 'counterfactual' proving that in fact yes a deadlier disease leads to more people taking it seriously. This happens because more people know someone who had to deal with the disease.
2.Taking the disease seriously is what matters to the left. Had Trump not exaggerated or downplayed the disease, that would have had currency with the left. I think showing an earnest effort to confront a challenge, whether it's COVID or the exit from Afghanistan, is what counts. It can be done well or poorly, but taking these things seriously is what counts."
2021-09-19 00:28:49,"Mr. Douthat certainly crams a lot of ""what-ifs"" in this article.

The absolute indisputable truth is that science denying and distrust of ""gummit"" is more highly concentrated among evangelical Christians, and said group is much more likely to identify with the Republican Party.

So if we were to concentrate efforts on improving our collective chances of surviving this pandemic (and the next, and the next...) it would behoove us to:

a) try to help that group come onboard to the realities of the 21st century; 

OR

b) cut them loose and let them die in their ignorance.

As long as they keep to themselves exclusively, I'm all in on Option b)."

You are an optimist. My guess is 7-14 years.

Part of why it will be so deadly is that we will not have learned the lessons from 12/19 to now. There were epidemiologists and others who wear flashing yellow lights saying ""This could be a big pandemic and we need to start gearing up now to find out where we have gaps in our pandemic defenses.""

We need to take the warnings of scientists more seriously. Or have a Covid-X10 pandemic."

But I also blame the antiscience woke, why run around in masks post vaccination, and demand others who are vaccinated do the same. The question I get repeatedly is why vaccinate if nothing changes. And I have to explain that when you are vaccinated, unless you are seriously immunocompromised, everything does change. You get your life back. Masks are not necessary. This accurate and scientifically true, data based argument is the only ticket to success I've had with the antivaxx crowd. And the woke can't take it. Just terrible people on both sides."

So far.  This is based on the reported 675,000 U.S. Covid-19 deaths to date and on approximate city population figures drawn from Wikipedia.  Current U.S. Covid-19 deaths are probably higher than 675,000.  What that number will look like at the end of the pandemic is anyone’s guess.

I'm not sure it would make much difference. In fact the forms human society has taken politically and economically over history seem to presuppose or even create a high rate of human death. Every society has its spread of causes of death, from natural causes to accidents to disease to war to suicide. Increasing the rate of death from one cause just seems to drop the rate from other causes. It's a good question for all human population increase whether societies still presuppose a high death rate from various causes or even are getting better at creating deaths, designing who should live or die and how they should live or die.

A society seems to be for decreasing human death from various causes and increasing lifespan provided the society can grow, improve on itself, but if increasing population and lifespan cuts into a society's capacity to grow or perhaps only threatens current power structures it appears death rate from various causes increases until there is no threat to capacity for growth or perhaps only current power structure...

But so far it seems every society presupposes a certain level of death even if only from natural causes. It's certainly troubling in a world of increasing population and lifespan if societies are unable to translate that into growth and power structures transform because otherwise societies will probably create causes of death."
2021-09-19 01:15:15,"How many more times are people with wide influence over the general public are going to make the same mistakes? I am referring to the idea that just because most people (and especially children) who contract COVID-19 don’t get very sick the virus is somehow not so bad after all. 

This idea, repeated in the media all to frequently, gives ammunition to the anti-vaccine, anti-mask, and anti-restrictions crowd. The reasons behind vaccines, masks and crowd restrictions are to keep our health system functioning. When our health system is overwhelmed we suffer on multitude of outcomes, both short and long term.

We know the short term disruption taking place but we have not yet started to deal with the long term consequences of deferred health maintenance caused by COVID and when we do there will be a very high price to pay."
2021-09-19 01:19:57,"One death in 500 in America is the statistic stopped me and made me reflect on my 35 year career managing hazardous wastes and cleaning up Superfund sites. Billions of dollars have been spent on this effort, remediating everything from tons of PCBs released to the Hudson River, to removing pentachlorophenol from groundwater that had leaked from your friendly neighborhood dry cleaner shop. These cleanups happen when the risk of death or cancer to the exposed populations nearby rose above something like 1 in 100,000, based on a scenario where a child lived on the site, drinking the water, or eating some small amount of dirt every day for decades. People were outraged to find that their drinking water, or back yard soil was contaminated with some industrial waste that caused such a theoretical risk. 

So I have a hard time imagining what the reaction would have been if anyone ever encountered a hazardous waste site where the risk of cancer was 1 in 10,000, let along 1 in 500! EPA would have freaked, the public would be in a panic. Hanford's nuclear bomb waste sites so far have not presented such risks, though the possibility exists if the underground liquid nuclear waste tanks were to remain and someone in the future built a day care center or housing development on top of them. 

Human's perception of risks seem to be strangely too low due to by denial in some cases, but then too high when the cause of the risk is perceived as an evil corporation or individual. Go figure."

I heard a pundit remark this past week that it's a measure of how ""sick"" our society is that right wing Trumpers feel more allegiance to their tribe than they do to themselves, many risking death because of their refusal to take one of the highly effective vaccines developed through the sponsorship of their hero.

Who willingly allows themselves to die out of loyalty to their tribe?  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.  But the really horrible news is how many of our 666,000 deaths were  preventable, once the disease transmission mode was ascertained.

Hypotheticals aside, that so many would be willing to take lethal doses of a product designed for animals instead of a vaccine championed by Democrats is the sickest fact of all."

There are currently 35 million diabetics in this country and somewhere around 88 million prediabetics.  That adds up to almost a third of the population.  I do not see the CDC launching a major campaign to help people stop killing themselves from this disease.  The population of this country is obese, and inactive.

They embrace counterfactuals; their policies are based on counterfactuals.  Counterfactuals, as Douthat calls them from his ivory tower, are nothing more than alternative reality, illusions, deceptions, duplicity.

The way Douthat whistles merrily past reality is to turn everything into some academic exercise: ""whether ideology and identity and in-group loyalty determined everything about the pandemic response, or whether yada, yada, yada..."" This allows him to ignore hard realities in which his Republican Party has blood on its hands. 

This isn't about ideology, philosophy, cleverly turned phrases, or interesting speculations. It's about people dying. And it's about the people responsible for people dying not taking responsibility for their behavior.

Trump closed down that office.

Republicans like Mitch McConnell now claim that there never was a plan, and that Trump merely folded that office into a different agency.  Both are blatant lies.

So, Mr. Douthat, your fear has alrteady been put to the test.  And guess what: The Republicans-Conservatives messed up bigly.

We don't need your hypotheticals.  What we need is for partisan bloviators like you to get out of your fantasy-world of false equivalences; to acknowledge the fact that most of the messes we face are rooted in divisiveness that the Conservative-Republican has been promulgating for two decades; and to start supporting (or at least stop demonizing) Democrats-Liberals  who have been trying to do the right things all along."

Curious (in both senses of the word) the misnamed “right” position on this issue.  To extrapolate a bit, using their arguments, why should cigarette smoking be banned in restaurants, bars, sports stadiums, airplanes, work places and such?  That is an impingement on smokers’s freedom, and restricting their access to the cancer sticks, no doubt about it.  After all it’s their body they could say,  and if smoking affects others health negatively (just like Covid) that is too bad.  And besides it’s a job killer, look at all the poor farmers going broke, as well as the cigarette plants closing down and throwing people out of work.

But the effects, including eliminating second hand smoking by non smokers, discouraging people to take up the dangerous habit of smoking along with lower dry cleaning bills, have been deemed (correctly) as worth it.  Care to comment Douthat?"

How does this concept apply to the risks associated with the 2020 election where statistical analyses are even more certain, as in 100% of experts that the presidential race was not stolen from Trump? Yet the vast majority of Republicans believe the lie promulgated by Trump that it was stolen.

The same concept can be applied to the January 6 Capitol riot/ insurrection/ coup/ “peaceful tourists” event.

Ross's musing on counterfactuals ignores a pretty important thing: that the NIH, CDC, public health professionals at all levels, epidemiologists, virologists, and healthcare workers at the ground level were aligned on mitigation like masks, social distancing restrictions, and then vaccination. So if Trump had    embraced these, at the very least masks, he and his followers would have been aligned with those on the left, who were already aligned with objective science. There is no counterfactual universe wherein the ""libs"" would be against masking, against lockdowns or phased restrictions, or vaccines. We'd have to be imagining a world where Trump was pro-mask and pro-restrictions of some kind and Drs. Fauci and Birx were not. That world simply did not and does not exist.

If he truly feared the lack of preparation for the next pandemic, he would be calling out the fact that one of our major political parties, the Democratic party, has been in fact engaged in putting in place measures to mitigate and minimize the effects of the pandemic, saving lives. 

Similarly, if he truly fear the lack of preparation for the next pandemic, he would be calling out the fact our other major political party, the Republican party, has been disseminating falsehoods about the pandemic, and about the effectiveness of vaccines, and - across the nation - has been acting and ways to promote the spread of the virus and illness, injury, and death among our people.

If people did not put politics and irrational ideology, pride, hubris, and downright self-righteousness before the study and respect of epidemiology we would not have so many deaths, so many infected.

Most of this could be avoided with higher vaccination rates and better adherence to rather basic and easily complied with safety methods.

It is despicable that this has become a badge of belonging among the far right and the uninformed antivaxers.

There is no sign of eagerness of the population to go out and get vaccinated. Idaho expects hospitals in Spokane WA to pick up the slack. Meanwhile cancer victims and various other ER candidates can just wait. Washingtonians who have a high vaccination rate are paying the price for Idaho conspiracy theory belief.

The answer is easy - this nation would be fractured beyond repair. We would have had our nation's first dictator installed (Trump or one of his wannabes). 

As it is, this pandemic has cost this nation the lives of at least one in 500 of its citizens, and yet we have some 40% of the populace (the vast majority of them Trumpists) who refuse to take even the most basic of sensible precautions. 

And why is this? It's not because they were hoodwinked. It's not because they were brainwashed by Fox News. It's because they want to do anything in their power to destabilize this nation. And what better way than to weaponize a deadly pandemic?

Trumpists understand that this nation will not begin to make its way out of this awful chapter of our history, as long as COVID controls us. Thus, by prolonging the pandemic, they control us. They want to do anything in their power to bring down this Democratic president and this Democratic Congress.

Thus, if COVID were ten times deadlier, I suspect we'd have already seen a Trumpist dictatorship in place. A destabilized regime is much easier taken over by a dictator than a solid, functioning democracy. Thus, the 40% of our citizens, along with Trump or his next iteration, would have understood an opportunity ripe for the picking.

Many of these anti-mask anti-vaxxers purport to be Christians but are smart enough to know that their failure to wear masks and get a vaccine puts their fellow man/woman into direct jeopardy including many of our most vulnerable citizens while also proving to be overwhelming to doctors and nurses and other caregivers and retail workers who are on the front line"
2021-09-19 01:50:44,"Conservatives are in denial.  They don’t believe the 650,000 death number.  They think it is fake news.  Even when they get very ill or have lost a love one or two- they still deny it is this bad.  I don’t think there is a number that wakes them up - I shudder to think what it will take and I don’t even want to guess."
2021-09-18 20:28:20,"Mr Douthat seems to have forgotten, or put aside, a critical element from the earliest days of the pandemic:  Republicans told people that this was a ""Democrat"" plague, limited to blue states, and would never impact them.  From that tiny, nonsensical seed, we got a rousing chorus of  ""it's only killing old, expendable people""; it's not going to bother us rural folks,"" it's because ""those"" people are overweight/diabetic, etc; really, no one dies of covid; hospitals are making up the death data; the masks are killing you; and so on.  These Republican ""truths"" are now killing their base, with no end in sight.  

The Republican Party had full control of Washington when this pandemic started; it could have been the hero.  It chose not to.  Let's not pretend that more deaths would have been the turning point."
2021-09-19 00:53:31,"“Republicans still taking the libertarian side in debate after debate — closures, masks, now vaccine mandates.”
Republicans are not taking the libertarian side of a debate, they are making foolish and selfish choices and wrapping it in a libertarianism ideology .
The majority of Americans are being dictated to by a smaller and smaller minority and that has to change, whether it be by the Electoral College or the refusal to partake in Vaccination. End of story, period."
2021-09-18 22:10:37,"""I like this question because I’m interested in Covid counterfactuals — whether ideology and identity and in-group loyalty determined everything about the pandemic response, or whether there’s a world where Donald Trump went all-in for strict disease-fighting measures and liberals turned anti-lockdown in response, or one where Trump won re-election and hesitation over the “Trump vaccine” ended up stronger on the left.""

That is pretty funny.  I actually cannot believe you are asking these questions seriously because I believe you already know the most likely answers. 

You do realize that the left does not operate in a cesspool of disinformation and ignorance, right?   My speculation is that the left would have breathed a bighsigh of relief that Trump was being rational and following the advice of his medical experts instead of stoking partisan division."
2021-09-18 20:07:29,"Once people have decided they'd rather die than be told what to do, the exact odds don't matter as much as you might think.

You tbink the guy riding a motorcycle without a helmet looks at statistics?  Why would this be different?"
2021-09-19 01:53:17,"A death rate of one in 50, with the same transmission rate of this disease would have been a disaster beyond our control. Six million dead in the same timeframe. Think hospitals full and no one to treat patients.  People dying at home, in cars, on the street, and a total breakdown of society, the economy, civilization.  Supply chains come to a halt.  Emergency services overwhelmed.  Gas and food become scarce.  Gangs take control of neighborhoods and roads.  It would have been the apocalypse, and we missed it so narrowly no one even has a clue.  I have no desire to see how low humanity would sink in that scenario given how badly we have handled this fiasco."
2021-09-18 23:46:15,This is just crazy. Ten times deadlier would mean 7 million dead - over 2% of the whole population - a truly apocalyptic level of carnage for society. How could anyone argue that it would make no difference is beyond me.
2021-09-19 01:49:18,"I’ve been saying all along, if it made people’s’ eyes bleed and they showed that on tv, people would be running to get the vaccine!"
2021-09-19 01:56:40,"I think it would make a difference, and, sadly, his point is well taken that the regional fighting could be worse as a result. People are being trained by social media to be suspicious, hysterical but not prudent, divided and divisive - and don’t care enough that this is the case to drop it. 

But it’s also sad that unless one knows someone personally who has died, there seems to be no sense of sorrow or duty or care for ones fellow citizens."
2021-09-19 02:11:49,"""as terrible as it is that one in 500 Americans have died of Covid"" 

Ross Douthat is acting as if this death toll were final and the pandemic were over. It isn't. Current projections are for 776,573 deaths by January 1st, 2022, which would be one in 430 Americans. And that makes no allowance at all for more infectious and more deadly variants of the virus emerging in future, especially in areas of the world with large populations but little vaccination. It's a global world now and we can't wall ourselves off from such variants. 

There are rather few prospects for things getting better as long as a large fraction of the US population is uncooperative on public health and international vaccination efforts fall far short of what is needed. The chance of things getting worse is quite real. It's already happened with the appearance of delta and the resulting increase in deaths."
2021-09-19 02:13:25,"Remember back in March 2020, when people did think that COVID would be extremely deadly, due to European countries reporting 10% death rates and the widespread belief that China was hiding a massive number of deaths. It seems back then that people across the political spectrum were very scared and angry, and supportive of extreme measures. There was a poll from March 2020 that showed 95% support for restricting international travel and 90% support for closing K-12 schools. So I think if we actually had a COVID with a 10% death rate, people would go for pretty extreme lockdowns."
2021-09-19 02:13:45,"I doubt it would matter if it were far more deadly.  Look at what happened with the Black Plague.  There were plenty of people who sincerely believed that piety would protect them.  There were others who went after the Jews.  And then there were some who deduced what was going on even if they didn't realize what was causing it.  They may have been keen observers or someone in their lives had educated them about the importance of being clean, being careful with human waste, and isolation when an illness seemed to spread like wildfire.  The politics then were as crazy as the politics now.  

Humans are not known for their interest or ability to plan far into the future particularly if it involves results that are not visible.  We understand the results of an accident.  But the people who should have fixed the small part that led to the accident decided that the cost of the fix wasn't.  

We are shaped by life.  Many people alive now haven't seen the results of a measles epidemic.  They haven't had a relative or friend die prematurely.  Our culture has conditioned us to ignore signs of illness.  We are more afraid of losing our jobs than our lives.  And then there's the GOP which has aided and abetted the denial.  

I hear that deathbed conversions to believing in vaccination are becoming common."
2021-09-19 02:16:04,"Douthat says ""Republicans still taking the libertarian side in debate after debate."" The Republicans are do no such thing. The basic tenet of libertarian is that one is permitted to do anything that does not cost others without their consent.  At this point, the unvaccinated are free riders on the healthcare system when they get sick, infect others especially when unmasked in in door public places, and human laboratories for the generation of variants that might outfox current vaccines. In sum, they very much impose costs on others without theirs consent. In Ayn Rand-speak, refusing to get vaccinated is anything but a 'libertarian' position."
2021-09-19 02:25:31,"I suspect that in a very important way, the coronavirus IS roughly 10 times worse than than people generally recognize. If it weren’t for medical intervention all those people - including and especially Trump - would be dead. All the people on ventilators, the few we’ve learned about who have had double lung transplants, those who have been given Remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies."
2021-09-19 02:26:17,"If Covid were 10 times as deadly, the US would have 6,700,000 deaths to date.  But that doesn't mean much.  Look at it be state.  

California would have almost 7 million deaths, or 15% of the total population.  Texas would have 18% of its inhabitants dead.  Florida, 25%.  Louisiana and Alabama each clock in at 35%.

The federal government would probably step up vaccination urgency.  Would the governors and senators of the southerb states change their approaches?  I'd like to think so, but I wouldn't lay money on it."
2021-09-19 02:32:02,"As the US approaches the lowest vaccine level in the developed world (other countries vaccinating more), it is clear that the naked politicization of covid response is responsible for this unecessary illness and death (and long-term disability).  It is rightly laid squarely at the feet of FOX nation and their GOP minions.  We would have only needed ordinary human decency in the President  in the time of Trump to have proceeded on a better path.

The only true counterfactual to be explored is ""what if there had been a President with ordinary human decency in the officed at the time"".  The fallout still would have been horrendous, but we could be seeing a corner to turn."
2021-09-19 02:32:47,"The death count is high enough, but we have not even considered the long term effects of Covid, that is, damages to lungs or cognition, or kidneys. Who will be paying for the after care?"
2021-09-19 02:36:08,"The scientists and epidemiologists were right to react with a measured panic. First reports of the lethality rate coming out of China had it at 4.5% and perhaps higher. This could have rather suddenly led to two to three million deaths in the US alone (I wrote about this potential in the early days when I myself had a relatively mild (?)case of Covid-19 and I was quickly accused of being alarmist, exaggerating.) People would have been dying at home, even picking up the bodies would have stretched capabilities.

Dr. Fauci was wise, and proved right, when the death rate started being measured under 2% of those infected. He urged calm, careful measures. Still, that death rate was far higher than experienced for seasonal flu. Plus, there was, and is, the ""you never know"" potential of mutations that could be even worse than the delta variation.

As for counterfactuals, I like to consider them. Usually I don't write about them because the world, Facebook and am radio hosts are all crazy enough without getting any boost from me. Still...

Is it possible that we have extended the impact of the coronavirus with vaccinations? Might this thing have run its course and be gone by now if we hadn't punched in the face?

Think about this: the 1918 flu pandemic ended on its own. We know that herd immunity can develop naturally as a virus runs out of hosts, people either being dead or developing antibodies. 

I will write a bit more of this if my comments are published and open for replies."
2021-09-19 02:39:17,"Actually if we put the 'uncounted' deaths that have not been used, the death rate for Covid would be worse.

However, this is not to say it can't get worse, because there's always the possibility of a worse variant developing that the vaccines do not even come close to fighting off.

We still have people in this country who outright refuse to consider the virus is real, hence they will not protect themselves against it, putting themselves and everyone else at risk for potential death.

It could become much much worse. Let's hope it does not, lest we someday find that we are being overly optimistic in saying we have the ability to win a war that we have only started to fight."
2021-09-19 02:41:30,Over the past 40 years the expansion home schooling and Christian fundamentalist schools which teach opposition to the most basic principles of modern science has produced an expanded proportion of the population willing to disbelieve and resist the conclusions of scientists. As long as the disbelief has no immediate negative consequences the implications of this cancerous growth of deliberate ignorance inculcated by fundamentalism are not obvious. What the pandemic has done is expose the deadly features of this disease in the social body. One has only to look across the northern border to see higher vaccination rates correlated with lower levels of home schooling/fundamentalist schools.
2021-09-19 02:43:19,"If Covid were 10 times worse, and it was worse in the same age groups as now, most of the response against action would be the same. Those under 40 or 50 who are least affected would still think themselves as invulnerable to it.  What this pandemic has revealed is how selfish many  people are and their reluctance  to work together to protect the vulnerable."
2021-09-19 02:45:14,"It's not just nursing home residents who got hit hard, it's old people in general.   I'm old, and I've been very afraid of this virus since day one.  Ironically, I didn't know anyone personally who died from Covid until Delta took over.  Now I know personally of half-a-dozen deaths, and it just feels like vultures circling.  That's why I WANT MY BOOSTER NOW.  I think the people who discounted the virus from the beginning, consciously or unconsciously, didn't think deaths of old people were that serious of a problem, not worth being inconvenienced for. 

Now it is killing the unvaccinated (for now), including younger people.  The unvaccinated in ICUs are reportedly shocked that it could happen to them (duh).  That is, if they can find an ICU bed, which is the other scary bad part of the pandemic---what it does to the hospitals.

My red state, which was pretty smug in the early days when it was hitting New York, has subsequently had a pretty hard ride, and it ain't over yet."
2021-09-19 02:26:03,"Now covid has 5 times more incidence per 100 k pop in the UK and USA than in Europe.
UK and USA at close to 45/50 and France at 12 , Spain and Italy at 7 and Germany at 12 also.
Great success for the 2 nations who refused to reciprocate on the vaccine when european citizens were dying for lack of vaccine.
And the US and UK were making fun of the socialist bureaucracy of Europe to be slow.
India, China and the EU exported 50 % of their vaccines.
UK and USA = zero. They kept all for themselves.
70 % of the Pfizer vaccine inoculated to US citizens was produced in the EU .
Pasteur is in the process of certifying a much easier and efficent vaccine than Pfizer and Moderna taken thogh the nose, for all populations, young, old, children, pregnant women."
2021-09-19 02:46:59,"I love it that his underlying argument is that maybe, just maybe, if deaths were 10 times higher, if almost 7 million people were dead, the right would take COVID seriously. It speaks volumes for the pathology that is right-wing America."
2021-09-19 02:49:29,Another question. Suppose that there was a 1 in 500 chance that you would die whenever you took a car trip. How many of us would drive daily if it was very likely that we would die after about a year and a half?
2021-09-19 02:53:19,"Some stats from our state. Population 1.78m
These are from the start of the pandemic.
Infections 898 (of which 680 were returning OS travellers)
Deaths 4
Currently:
Active cases 7 - all returned travelers in quarantine
ICU - 0
In hospital - 0

Sounds great?
You can't enter the state without approval
If returning you must quarantine 14 days, although they're now allowing home quarantine for residents
You can't travel overseas - even if fully vaccinated
You must wear a mask - except outside exercise
You can't drink or eat standing up
You can't dance and I think sing
You must use QR codes entering any business
Density limits apply within all businesses and Covid marshals  enforce QR codes, masks and density limits
Various limits apply to personal gatherings
There have been several total lockdowns as well
And ours is a Conservative state government, which by the way has an election in March
I'm old enough that most of these don't worry me much personally, but they create difficulties for my businesses.
But freedom it isn't. This is what the US would have had to do to control the virus.
Is that likely under any government there?"

2021-09-19 03:07:25,"If the death rate were 10X higher, the number of deaths might affect the outcome in future elections.

2021-09-19 03:09:00,Chance of death from a car accident is 1/107 over your lifetime. Banning private cars would be less disruptive than the measures taken to combat covid and would save many more years of life. Why is the death toll from cat accidents acceptable?
2021-09-19 03:36:51,"If the death rate were 10x higher and we were at hitting 5,000 deaths a day in New York City in the early days of the pandemic there would have been chaos. Not a soul would go to work in grocery stores or delivery for Amazon, UPS or FedEx. We would have famine in America due to lack of food transportation and delivery anywhere in the country and the world.

The death toll due to COVID would be minimal compared to the death toll due to the chaos that would have ensued because of the high death toll."
2021-09-19 03:37:50,"The ""unfortunate"" part of COVID-19 (if you think that 600,000+ deaths are somehow acceptable) is that non-lethal infection does not cause horrible disfigurement (smallpox) or permanent disability (polio). In those latter two cases, this was sufficient to trigger universal vaccination, a result of which was entire control of those particular viruses.  Death by COVID is somehow sanitized, by being sequestered away into ICUs. The perception of a truly horrible death by suffocation is not widely appreciated.  If it was, vaccination and mask-mandates would approach 100%."
2021-09-19 03:44:44,The unvaccinated are 10-11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than the vaccinated. The politics behind the vaccine speak for itself.
2021-09-19 03:54:00,COVID is now endemic. Every person needs booster shots every 6-8 months and wear masks for the rest of their lives. Otherwise the risk of getting severely ill and dying of COVID in a person’s lifespan is very high.
2021-09-19 03:54:30,"Focusing on deaths has always been a red herring. 

The main problem has always been the rate of hospitalizations. 

People have died because they couldn't get a bed in any hospital due to clogging by Covid patients. 

No article or pundit ever mentions that vital hospital staff have been burnt out and lost to the system in droves. 

If another variant comes the health system will eventually collapse. That's when you'll see high death tolls and it's a very real possibility. 

Un-vaccinated populations are just breeding grounds for that next variant. There is still plenty of opportunities for the un-vaccinated to kill us all."
2021-09-19 04:02:51,"This article is so self-centered, and so twisted even Jesuits would feel nauseated upon reading it. It's not just about the deaths (although, seriously, that's so much pain and suffering and loss, and to have people who claim to be pro-life dismiss even one life as an acceptable loss is mind-boggling).It's about the human pain. The pain of the mourners, the 120,000 orphans, the long-haulers, and the dead whose lives were cut short by an often excruciating disease.
There's also the collateral pain of those whose lives got deeply affected. Still can't travel, won't see my parents and siblings for three years (best case scenario). And yet, I am pretty proud of not having caused the demise of a Filipino nurse (I read that story in the NYT) or prevented a daughter from supporting her mother while she was dying from cancer (I heard that story on Michigan radio). I am proud of not having made life harder for healthcare workers. 
So, nice try Mr Douthat, but you can't spin this. This is an epic moral failure for Conservative Americans and an even worse failure for most people who pretend to be Christian (hint: there's Christ in Christian, and a guy who went through literally excruciating pain for others would very likely have worn a mask and gotten a vaccine). Sadly we won't need to wait for another pandemic, we already have climate change, that other 'hoax' that is already killing and upsetting the lives of millions of people."
2021-09-19 04:11:20,"I often think about it too. I doubt if 5 million of us were in the process of dying over a year that supermarkets would remain open because whatever management or even governments might want too many wouldn't show up to work. Food would be delivered by the army and the national guard in trucks to supermarket parking lots and you would be allowed to get in line on a certain day of the week to pick up basics like potatoes, oil and bread and chops etc. No real shopping. Sort of like when they were giving out free food to everybody in those lines of cars a while back. Remember? I think restaurants and coffee houses etc. would just go belly up. Life would revolve around the plague if 5 million of us were dying until it was over. That's what would be different. Schools? Ha!"
2021-09-19 04:15:15,"I hate to tell Ross the truth but there’s nothing libertarian about the Trump and Republican response to covid. It’s anti-science, anti-knowledge and completely devoid of facts. It’s not a matter of freedom but one of civic duty since each person’s decision to not get the vaccine affects many other people. It leads to more deaths and more variants over time."
2021-09-19 04:17:49,"Mr. Douthat skates over one point: what governors will do. He holds steadfast to the idea of states rights rather than national laws. That is the problem we're having with the pandemic: states doing their own thing without there being a way to control travel between states.
He likes to assign his religious belief on all of us, regardless where we live, but hews to the canard of states rights.
Just stop, Ross, just stop."
2021-09-19 04:22:07,"How nice for Mr. Douthat that the global pandemic hasn't affected him. Counterfactuals interest him more than the 673,000 deaths - sounds like a Fox News host!  The truth is that Trump actually had a chance to handle COVID like a leader and unite people, but chose not to very early on. His strategy of doing nothing since ""the people in cities who didn't vote for him would die so who cares"" has seriously backfired with the majority of the deaths coming from states he won and people who did not take this pandemic seriously, just as Trump and most of his staff didn't."
2021-09-19 04:22:31,"if COVID-19 was 10 times deadlier it could not spread as well as it has because the carriers would be dead. COVID-19, especially the Delta variant, is in an evolutionary sweet spot."
2021-09-19 04:30:52,"Mr. Douthat does not seem to have picked up on the main reason why governments have imposed various levels of restrictions and measures to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It has been to preserve health care systems, prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, and buy time until vaccines could be produced. The fatality rate from covid is not a fixed, static number. It's highly dependent on the availability of health care and would have been much higher than we've seen without public health measures. As well, with overrun hospitals, the fatality rate from non-covid illness and accidents would have spiked."
2021-09-19 04:40:19,"What if a worse pandemic emerges in 20 years? We have some evidence that helps us answer Ross Douthat's counter-factual.
We can compare the higher number of deaths now, with much lower numbers when President Trump issued his guidelines March 16, 2020, and later extended them to 45 days.
Note the current lack of support for another lock-down, though it could save lives if it were possible to implement another one now.
Having seen astronomical levels of death due to government's catastrophic failure, and the fact-based distrust of government will inform people's decisions if a worse virus emerges.
I visit FoxNews to get a more balanced perspective, and if a worse pandemic emerged, many will look to other experts rather than Dr. Fauci or Dr. Blix, and not only among FoxNews viewers.
Some pundits have also lost credibility. For instance, Thomas L. Friedman advocated reopening before crushing the curve; when the rulers did that, it quickly helped undo much benefits of lock-downs. This also helps us become more skeptical in the future. We're beginning to see the systemic critiques that can also help us become more skeptical.
I am far more optimistic than most commenters here. Learning from this pandemic, with a fact-based distrust of government, we can be in a better place if confronted with worse microbe."
2021-09-19 04:50:12,"Ross, the basic problem with your column is you seem to assume that this is over or nearly over or can't get worse.  In fact, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the death toll could be 10 times greater than it is now over the next few years; so let's say 6 million in the US instead of 600,00.  I am not saying this is likely, I am saying this is possible; nobody is in a position to predict the outcome.  The variants are still a huge wild card, and the continued effectiveness of vaccines is not guaranteed.  in addition, there are vast numbers of people here and around the world who are not vaccinated.  With respect to closing schools, in my opinion this was not a mistake.  What will turn out to be a mistake is reopening them with Delta running rampant.  We will see why this is a mistake in the next few months."
2021-09-19 04:57:40,"As has been pointed out, the better answer to your more medical question is the medical answer - a ten times deadlier virus wouldn't spread nearly as widely, as carriers would be readily diagnosed and many would not live to spread the disease. So Americans are ridiculously and tragically stuck with Covid-19 as a political issue, meaning many more of them will die than if it were seen as a public health issue. 

Covid-19  is unstoppable because most infected people don't even know they have it. Eventually all of us around the world will get Covid-19 or one of its derivatives.  Like flu, it is a public health menace, best moderated through mandatory vaccination and behavioral change (e.g. wearing masks indoors in public places), but total eradication is not worth the social cost."
2021-09-19 04:59:05,"I just wonder how Mr. Douthat would react if I hypothesized about the September 11 attacks how things would had been different if instead of 3000 casualties there would have been 30,000 and then went on to insinuate that 3,000 wasn’t really all that bad. After all, most New Yorkers (99.9999%?) did survive on that day.

Mr. Douthat then goes on to talk about the next pandemic. But I would like to remind Mr. Douthat that this pandemic is not over at all. And if we keep going as we are - with Trumpish anti-vaxxers ruining everything - this pandemic may not ever be over in our lifetimes."
2021-09-19 05:02:28,"Douthat's in Never Never Land again with his 'counterfactuals'.  If Trump had won re-election, would liberals have been more anti-vax? Maybe in an alternate universe, but not in this one.  Can he seriously so misunderstand the belief systems of Right and Left?"
2021-09-19 05:04:29,"Ten times worse. The same deal? There might be something to that. 

Where I am - in the Deep South - to say that there's no awareness of the dangers of Delta-V would be a bit hyperbolic. But on the ground here, I'd say it's about a 50/50 split. And that other 50 is enough to keep this thing going indefinitely. Only 50% of people in my county - which is the most affluent county in Florida - have been vaccinated. And that number is constant: it's not moving. 

A little empirical science: I went into the fish store today. Saturday, a busy day. The rich-people fish store where fish costs $28/pound. About 30% of those rich people had masks. Some of the workers were not wearing masks. Several of those unmasked people were coughing. And I thought: ""Am I risking my life for some filet of sole and a bit of squid?""

Answer? Yes. I am risking my life - with a mask which is about 70% effective in a small crowded market. But not anymore. I believe in science and in living. Even if that means not buying ridiculously overpriced fish in a throng of patriots."
2021-09-19 05:14:33,"Just noting that the 10x scenario was probably avoided by lockdowns, masking, and vaccinations.
It’s interesting that these appear to be partisan political issues in the US. In much of the world this is not the case: for example here in Israel we too have a very vocal anti-vaccination crowd, but they span the political and social spectrum - right and left, Jew and Arab, wealthy and poor. Trump was certainly anti-science thus helped fuel the COVID contrarians and they fed each other, but those contrarian voices would exist regardless of political messaging. Yes, the GOP states are less vaccinated, but their populations are also less highly educated than in the Northeast or West Coast, and this probably has more to do with anti-science views than political affiliation."
2021-09-19 05:21:51,"I guess there is something to that scissors concept. It seems bonkers to me that anyone could think the death toll low enough to feel like anyone overreacted.

I remember being told last year that if the measures we were taking worked, it would feeling we had overreacted. It does not at all. It feels like we're a long way from even knowing the full toll."
2021-09-19 05:22:35,"I have been running the thought experiment about whether the response would be different if the vulnerable population had been different.  
I strongly suspect if there was a 13% death rate among teenagers, or babies or children, we'd have people clamoring for masks and vaccinations.  The 13% death rate is for those who are over 80.
That said, I'm glad it's hitting the old and ill.  I'd much rather have myself at risk than my children."
2021-09-19 05:24:10,"Well, Mr. Douthat, you could help avoid a future pandemic scenario in which the nation fails to adequately respond by ceasing any apologetics for ""conservatives"" who reject science and celebrate reactionary, authoritarian partisans. 

Religion is no help when pandemics strike. I mean, religion isn't much help ever, but when it is used, as it has been, to convince people not to be vaccinated and to abjure masks, then it becomes an obvious public nuisance. So quit making excuses for religion's excesses and push the pastors and priests to be responsible, speak responsibly, and respect science."
2021-09-19 05:33:33,10x higher death rates and our food supplies would have likely been affected which would have brought down the entire system.
2021-09-19 05:48:06,"One crucial point that almost everyone is missing is that the death toll isn't 675,000, it's MUCH higher. Deaths above expectation since March 2020 are more like 1,000,000 and the vast majority of those are from COVID - the only question is how to quantify ""vast"". I know Stalin's law of large numbers correctly suggests that big numbers sound like other big numbers, but the true death toll could be 50% higher what is being officially certified. For every two corpses you think of one of those freezer trucks, there is a third invisibly beside it.  

For that matter, I don't know why we only count from March. I had  a distant relative by marriage - a customs lawyer - die of probable COVID in New York in January 2020, with several more people catching the virus at his funeral. He too is excluded from the toll, largely thanks to the popular fiction that there was no COVID in the United States before the first lockdowns; no one was willing (or possibly even able) to test him."
2021-09-19 05:51:00,"We could recast Darwin's ""survival of the fittest"" to the ""survival of the smartest.""  Those who will not take advantage of the vaccine and masking have decided to put themselves and those around them at great risk. Perhaps this is nature’s way of culling the least fit among us and at the same time making our population stronger, smarter, and better prepared for the future.

The conservative hoax that Covid is nothing to worry about is increasingly dumbfounding in the light of the number of worldwide cases/deaths plus the debilitating PASC (long Covid) symptoms in a high percentage of even asymptomatic survivors.  Most Epidemiologists and Medical Scientists have stated that we probably under-count the world’s Covid cases and deaths by a factor of 3.  

Mask and vaccine mandates are not the American Nuremberg laws, and not a reason to harm checkout clerks at your local grocery store. It’s a tragedy that a public health crisis such as Covid should drive this country apart instead of pulling it together.  Getting vaccinated and continuing to wear a mask in high risk environments to protect the immunocompromised and those who cannot get vaccinated, would seem so simplistic in its motivation."
2021-09-19 05:53:18,"It’s perceptions, not actual numbers. 
If I stead of our daily diet of talking heads, tv stations would broadcast daily from the local ER and show your neighbor, school teacher etc struggle to breathe in the ICU, then we might have a different and I would say more realistic snd rational response."
2021-09-19 06:02:10,"Just wait and see if the Mu variant takes hold, Mr. Douthat.  Or some other variant that's even worse than Delta. The pandemic is not over yet."
2021-09-19 06:07:14,"Whether it is the next twenty, ten, one, or even beyond twenty, we will definitely encounter something worse.  It will come in a different but we have had three CoV outbreaks/pandemics in this century. So this seems like a pattern - that is like 7-10 years out. 

We got funded to do work on this kind of a problem but the vaccines working so well are a slight surprise. What the next pandemic may be more like influenza or a form of it where vaccines are only like 40% effective. Then even if the death rate is say 5x then the effective toll would be worse than COVID-19. Then I think we'd move faster on small molecule drug research than we are doing now, which is giving space to those who promote HCQ and ivermectin."
2021-09-19 06:07:50,"Humans are hopeless at anticipating future threats, like climate change, or assessing risks and probabilities. The political system, at least in the US, is a reproduction of a binary mode of thought that does not get close to understanding the complexity of empirical reality and how it changes. 

For those reasons, humans are likely a brief, albeit, interesting experiment in civilization.  After all, we can only claim around 200 years of 'modern' industrial society on a planet that is five plus billion years old. At this point, human society is just an aberration, flash in the pan, with no near future evidence of a stable society capable of existing on geological timelines."
2021-09-19 06:14:32,"Before Delta, when most of the hospitalizations were of people 60 and over, I was absolutely appalled by the widespread attitude that those deaths did not matter.  The false, ageist assertions people over 60 are all practically dead anyway, that they have all led ""full lives,"" let alone the boomer remover meme. That it was so great the pandemic did not affect children because they supposedly matter more.  I think people are taking Covid more seriously now that all age groups can wind up hospitalized.  But this can't go on; we need near universal vaccine and mask mandates."
2021-09-19 06:35:03,"It’s hard not be the pessimistic about the future; but, each present moment is all we can really manage. It is up to each one of us to make the individual choices that collectively can change the trajectory of our future. Just being pessimistic doesn’t change anything."
2021-09-19 06:53:15,"This is definitely a trial run.  That's why policies and procedures being devised now for this particular disease should be generalized and kept around so we can use them on future diseases.  Terrorism isn't going away, so we keep around the concept of ""current terrorist threat level,"" even if the level is green.  Similarly, pandemics aren't going away, so we should keep around the concept of ""current pandemic intensity,"" even if a particular threat is gone and the current level is green.  When COVID 2030 comes, we won't have to reinvent the wheel, we'll just ramp the level up to red."
2021-09-19 06:54:54,"It may well be easy at 1 in 500 for you and I, for that matter, to not have lost anyone that we know or are close to, but some families, especially those who have relatives who are vaccine/COVID deniers the disease has been disproportionately hard on....

My husband has a co-worker who has lost not one, but 5 family members to COVID - young family members, with children that the rest of the family now has to figure out how to care for....  For that family, they've been living what it would be like if the fatality rate were multiple times higher... and no, as far as I know, it has not changed their behavior or their thinking."
2021-09-19 07:00:18,"I would be careful declaring you are right about closing the schools being the correct move, before we have seen what the consequences of having them open all winter during a pandemic are.  Opinions on this could change rapidly if too many kids get sick."
2021-09-19 07:22:21,"If Covid were 10 times deadlier, then it would be essentially be ""Climate Change,"" and I believe the overall results would be the same ... at least in America."
2021-09-19 07:31:40,"Stop deluding yourself, Ross. The politicization of science and facts is a uniquely Republican trait. Choosing cult-like loyalty to the party against all logic and proven facts happens only on the Republican side. Like it or not, it has been proven many times that facts tend to have a liberal bias, not because the facts themselves are left-leaning, but because liberals tend to think with open minds and follow the science and the facts, while the other side increasingly rely on dogma, propaganda and bigotry, and reject the facts when they don't fit their pre-conceived worldview."
2021-09-19 07:36:42,"I think we already have a glimpse of the effect of ten times deadlier, or even five times deadlier. Covid-19 is much deadlier for people over 65; people over 65 are much more likely to take a vaccine. In fact, as opposed to vaccine resistance that exists in the general population, older Americans clamor for the vaccine, even in the South. Extend this to the total population if the chance of death was increased significantly and the result would be the same:much more vaccine acceptance, much less resistance."
2021-09-19 07:53:59,"Ross, your claim ""today it’s clear that the public-health authorities got all kinds of things wrong, and many bad decisions — especially about closing schools — were made in an atmosphere of panic"" is not true.  While Trump/Republicans were pressuring schools to re-open, they provided little to no funds to aid schools. No extra money for upgrades to HVAC systems or to enable other sensible safety measures."
2021-09-19 08:06:28,"The simple answer to the question posed by the headline is the one many of us have been giving, if not wishing for, for about 18 months now.
If Covid-19 was 10 times deadlier it would be doing the Lord’s work for the voting prospects in this country.

But we suppose it would be uncharitable to wish that it were so."
2021-09-19 08:27:12,"I find Douthat's use of the term ""counterfactual"" troubling.  In a political atmosphere in which ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts"" and other such egregious terms denying reality are rife, his casual use of ""counterfactual"" seems unwise.  Perhaps ""hypothetical scenarios"" would be a smarter term to use.  Language does matter."
2021-09-19 08:31:17,"Stop reading in the second paragraph where Douthat raises the possibility of a counterfactual world where liberals behave like Trump supporters. What he fails to mention is that this is not a one issue flip, Liberals simply being against something because Trump is for it. In this case, a mirror world would mean Liberals would also en masse turn again science. That's an awful lot of what-if to swallow to follow Douthat's red herring to bothsides-ism. 

After that he goes into the usual pretense the early science was ""wrong,"" rather than speaking on the basis of best then available information, belaboring the point, before backing into admitting even the early low estimates were more right than their critics. Of course, Douthat doesn't identifying who those critics were, calling them only ""optimistic critics,"" when we know the Trump White House early on knew they were lying to the American pubic. It wasn't optimistic criticism; it was cynical deception, plain and simple, in service of Trump's re-election. 

This piece is one misdirection after another, under pretense of open-minded consideration, all to reaching the possibility that neither side is responsible for our medically disastrous political polarization. It's really just that Goldilocks virus to blame, being neither too cold nor too hot. Whew! We are all off the hook. However, meanwhile, back in the real, non-counterfactual world, it's only the GOP that needs to be got off the hook. Ross does try marvelously hard."

In that alternate universe, where Donald Trump has brains and morals, his efficient response would have ensured his reelection. Of course, I'm not sure those traits would have got him elected in the first place. Brains and morals don't seem to be prerequisites for that party. They seem to prefer fluff and rage (and moot-point ruminating on 'counterfactuals')."
2021-09-19 09:45:18,"Not to be forgotten:  Trump did attempt to force the vaccines into use in the last month of the campaign.  There were some justifiable concerns about his this premature push solely for his political ends.  

Any concerns about Trump from the left were soon alleviated by credible trial results.   And the knowledge that the mRNA architecture of the ""rapidly"" engineered vaccines had been researched for decades.  Trump has nothing to claim for their development and success.  

Trump, for his political gain, injected chaos and division into the Covid fight.  It was in his interests, using Covid, to throw every doubt he could into the election process (e.g. voting by mail).  And it certainly did not help that his earlier attempts to monkey-wrench fake intelligence in the Ukraine on his future opponent added more fire and smoke where light was needed in our early response to Covid."

Shouldn't Mr. Douthat be concerned about our more immediate future? Look at the impact of the Delta variant, and then consider the likelihood that a stronger, more lethal variant may be in our near future if we can't raise our vaccination levels. 

This column turns a blind eye to so much of the suffering that currently exists in this country and will continue to affect people for years to come. It is a heartless consideration of one of the greatest tragedies this country has experienced in my lifetime."
2021-09-19 09:57:25,"I didn’t interpret Chris Hayes’ “what if” to mean that the right’s egregious dismissal of science and embrace of hydrochloroquine, ivermectin, mask burnings and refusal to socially distance themselves might improve were the death toll larger. Recent estimates indicate we may hit 800,000 deaths by 2022, and anyone with functioning empathy would have to agree that this is a morally repugnant death toll, sufficiently abundant to merit mitigating sacrifices among those of us willing to pitch in and help.

I’m pretty sure he and most of the MSNBC crowd believe, as I do, that non-vaccinated people dying in agony (which nurses tell me are some of the most gruesomely wretched final hours they have ever seen for patients and their families) seems not to have had the impact we all would have hoped: folks racing to their vaccination centers. The crowd that reacts with nuclear intensity to, for example, the death of 13 American soldiers in Kabul or 4 in Benghazi, just shrugs and mostly ignores the hundreds of thousands of COVID deaths. 

I think the question is if it was, as Ross discussed, 1 in 50 instead of 1 in 500, would the science-based vaccinated people who actually are grateful to Dr. Fauci and our public health officers increase their demands for even more mandates, such as proof of vacation to board an airplane?

Musing about the anti-vax crowd being swayed by suffering is pointless. Remember, school shootings don’t move the needle, and George Floyd’s neck was fair game."

2021-09-19 10:13:42,"But Ross, you miss one key point in your column.

Modern conservatives, especially those vocal about the public health policy, are also those who are most eager to ""own the Libs.""  They will come up with any narrative, however factually incorrect, to do so."
2021-09-19 10:35:06,Mr. Douthat leaves out the heavy toll that Covid has taken on our healthcare workers and continues to take unnecessarily now mainly due to failure by too many to act like responsible members of our human community and do their civic duty by getting vaccinated.
2021-09-19 10:38:09,"There's no scenario, no. matter how deadly, where we should ever expect Republicans to do the right thing.  How many lives have been lost b/c of climate change over the last 20 years?  And there has been no change in their position, in fact it has hardened even as more and more evidence comes in that doing nothing costs lives.  Republicans only bedrock principle is to oppose whatever Democrats support.  There could be 25X the amount of deaths from Covid and nothing would change."

His family resists masking. His grown daughter and son-in-law were infected attending a wedding and went on to infect the children and my brother's wife. The son-in-law was hospitalized, the wife is getting over pneumonia brought on by Covid and my brother never suffered ill effects due to the Regeneron he received after returning from a fishing trip. The question Douhat should be asking is, ""What if the cure cost a hundred times more than the prevention?""  Though it wouldn't be a hypothetical."
2021-09-19 10:42:57,"Unfortunately, there is a growing divide between the two political parties' outlooks on life and death as seen through some blinkered ideological cost / benefit analysis prism. One political party is becoming more comfortable with increasing rates of death due to gun violence. Their response is more guns. One political party appears completely unconcerned with the rising number of deaths due to Covid infections. They reason that if we can adapt to 700,000 Covid deaths, then 350,000 additional deaths is within acceptable limits. (It's all what you get used to.) One party seems to be completely immune to the first stages of the climate catastrophe about which scientists have been warning us. (The looming catastrophe is so big  that it's hardly worth contemplating.) They reason that it's in God's hands or expound on the cliche that we'll just have to adapt. 

In all cases, the party that accepts death as a natural outcome of daily living appears weak and passive in the face of problems that they themselves have created and abetted. They view the other party's emphasis on saving lives and averting catastrophe as shrill, naive, laughable. Yes, the division couldn't be clearer. 

Ironically, the pro-life party is becoming the Democratic Party.  Republicans viewed themselves as the pro-life party for decades, but the political inversion is underway and accelerating."

The vast majority of the patients I admit to the hospital are under 45. They are very sick, and they are crashing hard and fast. Our ICU beds are completely full. We are delaying intubations as long as possible because we don't have enough ICU beds to put them in."

Decisions about what protections to put in place during a pandemic must be taken BEFORE officials know for sure what the scientific facts are.  So the question boils down to which way are you going to LEAN:  in favor of saving lives (to the detriment of the economy and individual freedom), or vice versa.

I'm deeply saddened to watch right-wing ""libertarian"" governors force their views about Covid19 on their constituents by preventing localities from taking simple precautions like wearing masks or barring people who choose not to get vaccinated from some public spaces. Kris Kristofferson was right: ""freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose""."
2021-09-19 10:49:05,"Chris Hayes’s is one hypothetical, but here’s another:

What if COVID were far worse, not in its death rate, but as to the speed with which it kills?  Instead of days of incubation followed by days or weeks in hospital, with gradual transition from sniffles and sore throat to full-blown COVID and dwindling life on a ventilator, upon exposure victims would just keel over dead, as if struck by Michael Crichton’s fictional Andromeda Strain (of course, such quick transmission-to-demise would make a pandemic all but impossible, but this IS just a hypothetical)?

What might the social and political consequences be?"
2021-09-19 10:49:15,"The biggest issue I see over the Covid issue is that people are treating Covid like it is a human threat.  The idea of things like personal freedom and choice are within the construct of the human world.  

This is a virus.  It can not be reasoned with or negotiated with.  It does not care about anybody's constitutional rights or personal freedoms.  Like every other organism on out planet, its ultimate goal is its own survival, and it will not stop.

I remember the movie ""War of the Worlds"" where the only thing that stopped an alien species from destroying all human life was a virus.  Maybe we need to re-consider our place as humans in the the pecking order of nature.

In the meantime, I just carry a mask wherever I go.  If places want me to put it on, I put it on.  If they don't, I usually leave it off.  In my opinion, this issue has become more about trying to be a social joiner, whatever camp you may want to be in,  than about anything meaningful."

Champions of deaths rates too, which says a lot about the US  health care system and the NHS  quality too.

And they have much less social interactions than in Europe.

2021-09-19 11:01:16,"What you are saying, essentially, is that the Trump side (sorry—that’s what we’re talking about, not “conservatives,” or even “Republicans,” in my mind) don’t care about something that only effects other people and not themselves or their family members and friends. Then when it does, they suddenly find it to be something that “someone” should be doing something about. 

Sounds about right. We have certainly seen this phenomenon as it pertains to a number of issues. And when they do take a problem seriously, the approach of their political class is to blame Democrats for there being a problem, as a way of keeping their voters voting for them. Actual solutions are rarely considered. 

Still, you wonder. There are a lot of people dying of Covid who deny that they have Covid with their last breath. It is hard to admit you are wrong. But again, if things had started out more severely, they might not have been able to take such a hardened irrational position. 

Notice that this is going to be a hundred times worse as we confront climate change. Because it is so gradual, it’s early effects so selective, and the apparent cost of mitigation so great, denial will prevent any meaningful action.  When the effects are so bad that even the deniers change their minds, it will be way too late."
2021-09-19 11:09:36,"I'm not really interested by Ross' imaginings of what might have been.  What triggers me are the manner and the nature of our response, the panic if you will, for a disease that has actually quite a low mortality rate, that is moreover highly concentrated among people who were on their way out anyway, the elderly with complex ailments (sorry for the callousness).

Climate change is extremely likely to confront us with unknown pathogens, maybe tomorrow.  Either those that escape from deep in forests or those that lay trapped in layers of glacier or polar ice, hundreds or thousands of years old.

It is no stretch of the imagination to foresee much more drastic symptoms, far quicker effects, a different demographic falling victim to such a pathogen, etc. Or, why not, a pathogen that attacks crops or livestock, thereby upsetting the food-chain.

I don't have the impression that we are in any way ready for that eventuality.  But we should be."

2021-09-19 11:17:08,"America is fighting an uncivil war right now. It is a war declared by the Republicans against civility, honesty, integrity and most of all diversity. For the Republicans, the pandemic is simply inflicting collateral damage in this war, a small price to pay on the road to victory. If the collateral damage had been 10 times worse, then victory for Republicans would have come sooner rather than later. A truly horrible death toll that ravaged all age groups would have been twisted around by them to justify ever greater authoritarian rule. It would have been used by Trump et al to justify declaring martial law, closing all borders, clamping down on all forms of dissent and not bothering with elections. Those are their goals, and the pandemic would have been, and still might be, just one of several paths they could take to meeting their goals."
2021-09-19 11:22:11,"Politics have become so cynical and focussed on the maintenance of power for its own sake, that you have the specter of Ron DeSantis here in Florida. He is an educated man and a smart one. 

But he shopped around for a strategy to suit the ignorance of his base and discovered the Great Barrington group,  a Libertarian club that devised a hands-off plan to suit its belief that the government has little role in public health.

DeSantis was proven mostly right in not forcing hard lockdowns and closures in 2020, but tragically wrong in making local mask mandates another front in the culture war. Partly as a result of this flawed messaging, Florida's COVID case load/death rate rapidly advance from below the national average to the number two spot, behind the even more hapless Tennessee. 

This suggests to me that he would be unfit to govern in a pandemic 10 times worse than SARS-CoV2. Sound public health policy is the only tool we have in such circumstances, like it or not."
2021-09-19 11:23:08,"It's tough to overcome ill-numeracy, especially when there is an election at stake, when people have to shut down business, alter lives. But you'd think we'd try.

We only had to do it for about a year, and we failed.  So yes, I think Hayes might be right.

Put things in context, and work to get the numbers right. We didn't know what was going to happen, until Italy started turning the elderly away from hospitals. Two weeks later, NY was in the soup. But the rest of the country could have contained its still with a modest commitment to shut downs, and the resolution to use masks. We didn't.

Instead we got a list of reasons why business as usual was the way to go, from McConnell's lack of interest in blue state death, to Trump's hoax, to the narrative that 99.9% survive, as the right mixed up Purell effectiveness with real morbidity and mortality.

But a disease that can kill .1% - .5% of people, kills a ton of people when everyone gets it. Polio has a death rate in that range.
In fact we KNOW that the death rate of the disease is more than .1%, because math tells us that 670M Americans would have to be infected to kill 670,000. Likely the death rate is closer to .4%, with about 167 M Americans infected.

But the narrative that there is nothing to worry about keeps tourists coming, tax revenues rising, and people re-elected. And it cost just 670k deaths."
2021-09-19 11:24:26,"This hints at what I've been saying from the very beginning.   Once the dust from this catastrophe settles, we as a nation need to continue this conversation.  This pandemic has highlighted a few things in my opinion, some new, some old.  1. Our response to catastrophe is typically slow and frankly unorganized.  We see this play out every few years when big hurricanes hit and it takes days for FEMA to get their act together.  2.  We're simply not prepared for any kind of large scale catastrophe.   Not just from a physical provisional (food, water, basic necessities) standpoint but from a societal and policy standpoint either.  I think it's obvious we need to do a lot more planning on a national level of how to respond to widespread and disruptive threats.  For one, massive depos should be setup for basic necessities and a system put in place for their distribution.   Best thing to do would be to partner with our commercial industries in this since they already have much of the infrastructure in place.   Give them tax breaks or something to be part of the program.   I also think we need legislation to prevent catastrophes being used for political maneuvering.   I'm sorry but I'm vehemently against any and all non covid related provisions in the ""relief"" bills we've seen passed.  Additionally, we need to decide as a nation where the line of acceptable losses gets drawn and build policy and procedures around that.  It's a complicated topic and I've already ran out of space."
2021-09-19 11:30:14,"An essay designed more to provoke discussions, than to state an opinion (perfectly acceptable). As the religious specialist among columnists here, Ross could do a big favour to us all by broaching the subject: are religious exemptions to vaccines valid? Since all major religions support vaccination, are we only left with Jehovah’s Witnesses able to refuse the jab? Does Ross think someone can simply say vaccinations are against my personal beliefs, and that’s enough? Does vaccination refusal trump requirements to meet social obligations to fellow humans? If so, why?"

Anti-vaxxers and snake oil salesman abounded then as they do now. We had a president who ignored the raging plague then as we did today. Really, tell me what have we learned?"
2021-09-19 11:35:08,"I'm not sure how this article is even considered to be a rational examination of the COVID crisis.  While Ross mentions a couple of scientists that got it wrong, he deliberately left out Republicans/conservatives who deliberately played down the seriousness of the virus.  
Over and over again, the former president and his enablers spouted the lie that the virus was a manufactured hoax to hurt 45's chances to get re-elected; that the dangers were over-blown; that social distancing and masks were a sign of liberal bias; and are STILL pushing the idea that asking the public to wear masks and get vaccinated against a deadly virus are a 'plot' by the government/big pharma/democrats/whatever to control your life.  That this is insanity is clearly demonstrated by the fact that various state governments require up to 10 inoculations in order for children to go to school and this has never been seen as a 'violation of civil rights' by the general public.  This is a political phenomenon."

2021-09-19 11:42:02,"“ Covid has been deadlier than many people on the right hoped or predicted, and yet the partisan divide that took shape last spring hasn’t really budged, with Republicans still taking the libertarian side in debate after debate — closures, masks, now vaccine mandates.”

Let’s be very clear - when someone willfully denies a life-saving vaccine but happily accepts a brand-new, $2100/pop antibody treatment that’s paid for by tax dollars, it isn’t libertarianism. It’s leeching."

Not quite a  “gotcha” moment, Mr. Douthat.  Not really a point either."
2021-09-19 11:51:42,"I've pondered the scenario and wondered how many times worse would the pandemic have to be to obtain a unified response.  If not 10 times, is it 20? 100?  How many people have to die, Ross, before the stubborn 40% minority would get on board with the life-saving policies available to them today?"
2021-09-19 11:58:09,"I've posed this same counterfactual with friends, and I think that if the virus had been 10 times more deadly, we would have seen exponentially more panic-buying and civil unrest. But contemporary US politics is existing in an alternate universe, and has been for a few decades now, one in which empirical evidence does nothing to affect or sway political positions, because all politics is now performative. So both parties would have fallen in line in basically the same way that they have. In the face of smaller ""epidemics"" (climate change, deaths of despair, lack of accessible health care, etc.), politicians across the (very narrow) spectrum just read their lines and take their bribes - sorry, their campaign contributions from lobbyists."
2021-09-19 11:58:28,"Hopefully we as a nation won't be put to the test again anytime too soon, I have totally lost faith in our ability as a people to unify to confront the big problems. So many of our fellow Americans are unwilling to do even the bare minimum, to make even the smallest sacrifice (masks). That does not bode well for the future of the United States.

All Biden would have to do is tell the country that Camel cigarettes won't protect you against Covid and close to half the country would take up smoking. If Trump made a similar statement I don't think there would be a noticeable uptick in Democrats smoking. So to answer Douthat's question, no, I don't think Democrats would become anti-science and anti-truth if roles were reversed."
2021-09-19 11:59:15,"Republicans are relatively unconcerned about 675,000 Americans dying from COVID, and 40,000 dying annually from firearms.  Ten times that would not likely change their opinions.  When four American servicemen died in Benghazi, however, they quickly mobilized against Hillary Clinton.  For Republicans the dangers to the health and safety of Americans are merely an opportunity for political exploitation, not rational and ethical action."
2021-09-19 12:02:19,"There are so many inaccurate statements made by Mr. Douthat in this piece that I don't have enough words to enumerate them.  But for one, his statement that it was a mistake to close schools and that children are relatively immune from serious COVID illness is ridiculous.  One out of four COVID cases today is in children and last week 330 children were hospitalized each and every day in this country.  OK, I guess Mr. Douthat just doesn't care about kids, or maybe other kids who are not his own and get infected with COVID and die.  And I would also suggest that this current wave of the pandemic is being accelerated by kids being back in school.  Even if it were true that kids did not get seriously sick from COVID, they spread it to those who are most vulnerable.  It was correct to close schools last year and they should be closed this year.  Many schools have already closed this year due to uncontrollable pandemics within them.  And when Governors of two of the most populous states in our country forbid mask mandates, well yes, then just close the schools."
2021-09-19 12:05:56,"Given the current tenor of debate about Covid in the US, we don't think there is any number of deaths or hospitalizations too large to change the opposition to vaccination.  They would rather take their chances rather than save themselves and their communities"
2021-09-19 12:09:36,What if masks were never recommended and no businesses ever closed. How many dead would we be counting from deadlier variants if there were no mandated response at all.
2021-09-19 10:51:26,"Let's not forget that the 2003 SARS coronavirus killed over 10% of those who were infected, and that the MERS coronavirus continues to kill about 35% of those infected.  

Think about that for a moment.  We know that SARS-CoV-2 can accumulate mutations that make it more infectious (i.e. the delta variant).  We know that SARS-CoV-2 can acquire mutations that reduce the effectiveness of vaccines (i.e. the mu variant).  Finally we know that closely related viruses have DNA differences that make them much much more deadly (i.e. 2003 SARS and MERS).  

At the rate we're going, we will not need to wait for a new epidemic to test this hypothesis.  We just need to stay the course and wait for SARS-CoV-2 to acquire whatever mutations make it more deadly.

Right now we're unbelievably lucky to have a vaccine that is both very safe and very effective.  Please, please just get the damn shot so we can put an end to this ongoing trajectory."
2021-09-19 12:10:18,"Dohut is correct when he says that the virus is just lethal enough to provide reason for some to take all precautions and at the same time just weak enough to lend support to having a more relaxed attitude.  Everyone should be able to do their own calculus on this one at this point.  If the lethality was higher or if it affected the young and healthy with as much intensity, then I believe many would calculate the risk/benefit of vaccinating/isolating very differently."
2021-09-19 12:10:24,"I fear that because this pandemic was not even more deadly, right wing attitudes toward public health measures are now baked in, and they will fail us when the big one comes."

    When, exactly, will be allowed to state the extremely obvious?
   Seriously."
2021-09-19 01:06:50,"This may be the weirdest stupidest piece Douthat has ever written. It reads like a cleaned up transcription of an undergraduate bullsession among drunk young Republicans.
What does stand out  is that the oh so Christian and Catholic Douthat professes himself to be indifferent to the suffering of those he does not know. Not only is this contrary to what I understand to be Christian morality but it is a denial of community that Douthat goes on about. It is not a liberal who is here denying fellow feeling but an antediluvian religious zealot. Atheistic liberals have more fellow feeling and more sense of  community than Douthat does.
This is the last column by Douthat I read. i am letting my subscription to a paper that can give space to this sort of garbled nonsense lapse. I will miss the readers' responses."
2021-09-19 12:15:14,"I'm a conservative.  Yes, I voted for Trump.  Twice.  However, the pandemic has become a ""safe"" form of protest.  Why?  Well, because it's NOT ten time more deadly.  If it were, you can be sure that many on my side of the divide would be signing up to take the vaccine.

Currently, if you don't take the vaccine, then despite all the tragic deaths that we read of, there is still a very limited risk that you will die from it.  Even if you catch it.  

When my son and I caught COVID, I cannot tell that it impacted me at all...except for a temporary loss of taste and smell.  I imagine that is not far off from the experience of others who have had COVID.  So it's quite easy to dismiss the sturm und drang of the matter, thinking that it probably isn't all that important to get the vaccine.

And yet....  Just this past weekend, I drove to Tennessee for the funeral of my cousin's beloved son (he was 26-years-old).  He died from COVID.

Here's the thing we should be thinking:  Yes, there may not be any great risk to you even if you caught COVID.  But neither is there any big risk to you if you take the vaccine.

The worst that could happen if you catch COVID is worse than what could happen if you take the vaccine.

Unfortunately, the nature of science is that we do start one way, find out it's the wrong way, so go in another direction.  That, and the muddying of the water by Trump having to have something to say all the time, creates the appearance of just guessing."
2021-09-19 12:18:30,"We are approaching the same number of deaths as Civil War 1 - 750,000. If Covid was 10 times deadlier (a possibility with future variants) it would equal the per capita percent of US deaths - 2.5% in the Civil War 1. We are now in year 5 of Civil War 2... the Trump war."
2021-09-19 02:33:02,Perhaps it’s time we think about how these people died rather than the number. Drowning in your own body fluids is not going quietly into the night. Get a shot and put a mask on for god’s sake.
2021-09-19 12:19:36,"Ross postulates a hypothetical to avoid facing the realty we all live in.
Actually, the pandemic eventually did turn out to be many times more deadly than Trump (and some so called medical experts cited by Ross) predicted; and it has spawned the even more contagious Delta variant. How has the GOP responded? Rejection of public health protocols like masking; stressing personal freedom rather than defeating the pandemic by rejecting vaccine mandates; and pivoting to their favored, divisive issues: promoting the Big Lie, voter suppression and eliminating a woman’s right to choose."
2021-09-19 12:20:04,"Biological herd immunity is constantly suggested as a management target, which if reached, would end the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is a more important type of herd immunity (psychological) that is referenced in the article. Because COVID-19 has a high recovery rate, unlike for example cancer, it is unusual for any one individual to personally know a person who has died from COVID-19. The present overall death rate from COVID-19 in the US is approximately 1 in 500. Psychological herd immunity is not a new concept. It is often suggested that the acceptance of alternate modes of sexual preference occurred because the average person had either a family member or a close friend who had come out as openly LGBTQ. Recent estimates for LGBTQ in the US put this figure at 1 in 18. Whether this number has been increasing over time is more of a function of changes in awareness, rather than lifestyle. 

Basically until COVID-19 strikes close to home, some people will not treat the disease with a sense of seriousness. For this segment of the population, no amount of education and coercion will change their stance."
2021-09-19 12:13:55,If it was 10x deadlier Trump would have probably died after he was infected.   I wonder if that would have changed MAGA thinking.  Possibly it would just have triggered more elaborate conspiracy theories.
2021-09-19 12:21:11,"Well he uses the expert projections on what the death toll would ultimately be.  But he doesn't cite the one that really mattered.  15, soon to be zero.  Compare that to 670,000.  That is the one the right believed when they were told that's what would happen.  And the fact is that 15, soon to be zero was so far off the mark , the right thinks more about what Fauci says when he attempts to pin down a moving target. The virus runs the show.  As to schools should have reopened and the majority dead being elderly, we all need to stop looking at what group gets impacted the most and start looking at what the ultimate goal should  be.  Namely to curb the spread of the virus.  To curtail it's ability to thrive, mutate, and make people very sick. To make it far more predictable. The real issue is NOT if schools are opened or closed.  The real impact is are their hospital, especially ICU, beds.  Are there enough ventilators, dialysis machines, ECMO machines, nurses, techs, and doctors to care for the sick?  But no one on the right seems to care about that.  And can Ross predict with any certainty what group will be next if the virus mutates again?  Let's see....who is left....unvaccinated, vulnerable, crammed into close groupings, with weak immune systems?  I'll give you three guesses, Ross, and the first two don't count."

The logical conclusion of this pursuit has been Donald Trump and an open embrace of fascism by double-speaking erstwhile American patriots.

The position of rank and file Republicans is now that anything Democrats want is bad simply because Democrats want it - even in matters of public health. Democrats feel that way about anything associated with Trump. Trust of the other side is non-existent.

Would a 10X deadlier pandemic change the dynamic of division? It could. But that change would require levels of competence that government may not be capable of."

2021-09-19 10:19:12,"Mr. Douthat, if you are doing some thumb sucking, think about this: What if we were fighting a war, and the death toll were more than 2,000 soldiers a week? I would wager that everyone in this country, regardless of political leaning, would be up in arms. It is distressing that a public health crisis has been so politicized that common-sense measures like vaccinations and social distancing have become controversial. Focusing on the death toll from COVID blinds us to the reality that currently in many locales there is no capacity to treat the acutely ill non-COVID patients. Sometime in the future all the numbers are sorted out, we will find out that not only did we lose a large number of our fellow countrymen to COVID but many other died unnecessarily because they could not get access to the care they needed because COVID patients overwhelmed hospitals and caregivers. Debating whether the response to COVID would have been different if deaths were 10 times more than projected misses the point. There has been way too much needless dead and suffering because our response was political instead of logical."

2021-09-19 12:23:09,"Three right wing radio hosts who made it their primary focus to be against the vaccine and masking and social distancing have died this year - their business model killed them and some of their listeners as well.  They spread lies and disinformation and to my horror, successfully expanded the cult of the ungovernable.  

This is not over- winter is coming.  Healthcare workers are fed up and ten times more death is not an impossible goal to achieve. Republicans are working their hardest to achieve it."
2021-09-19 10:37:24,"I’m betting that if we had had a Republican president who wasn’t as amoral, divisive , and just downright stupid as trump, this upending of science wouldn’t have happened."
2021-09-18 21:57:13,"If Covid left visible traces, like smallpox, there would be absolutely no vaccine hesitation.  Every female in America from right wing Trump lovers to Marin County left wing dimwits would be running to get vaccinated."
2021-09-19 12:23:30,"Right wing positions on masking and vaccination are not libertarian, they are anti-liberal. To call them libertarian is to assume they reflect a coherent intellectual foundation.  They do not. They reflect merely a childish, emotional response to policies perceived as liberal.  Perception of the source of the policy, not its elements, is central to the right wing reaction.  

To take another counter-factual, what if Trump had remained President and pushed a vaccination message or even vaccination requirements? In that scenario, I imagine the vaccines, products of the Trump driven Operation Warp Speed, would have been seen as a Republican victory, a validation of Trump, and an example of American exceptionalism.  I think Democratic voters would have followed the science and good sense even if it was a victory for Trump, and our vaccination rate would be much higher."

2021-09-19 12:29:57,"Douthat is mistaken. The nation is preparing for the next, worse pandemic. It is doing it wrong. 

The preparation problem can be seen in courtrooms, where case after case results in gratuitous decisions which prioritize individual liberty (especially religious liberty) ahead of suppressing contagion. That only looks acceptable because of the quirky distribution of Covid's fatalities.

If this were a pandemic which killed an appreciable fraction of everyone—sparing no demographic—the legal foundation being laid down now would prove catastrophic. The courts must wake up and recognize that it is folly to gut public health emergency powers with decisions slanted toward individual liberty. The last thing the nation needs is another eruption of self-entitled claims, and defiant resistance, while it is trying to cope with something like, for instance, weaponized smallpox."
2021-09-19 10:55:57,"The problem goes far beyond COVID19.  

A dynamic has developed wherein science, expertise and facts are rejected if they seem to come from resented “elites”, and any crazy nonsense is believed if uttered or supported by the raging orange con man. That goes for Covid, climate change or even whether the January 6 Capitol rioters were simply “normal tourists”. 

 America’s fringe right has always had a deep streak of anti-intellectualism and anti-government paranoia.  But that fringe today encompasses nearly the entire Republican Party and its paranoid lies are amplified on social media by both hostile foreign enemies and unprincipled domestic demagogues."

2021-09-19 12:34:19,"One of the things that makes Covid a perfect scissor issue is that the fatality rate is quite variable.  The 1 in 500 doesn't really capture the whole picture.  According to a recent Washington Post article  the 1in 500 applies to the population as a whole but different groups see a whole different story.  For those 85 and older it's 1 in 35.  For whites 18-40 it's 1 in 16,000.  So everyone gets to see what they want to see in their own cohort.  Everyone gets their view vindicated and can't understand they ""other""."

Of course the question remains:  When is too much finally enough?"
2021-09-19 12:34:52,"If Covid disproportionately killed children, it would have been taken seriously from the beginning.  Many leaders reflected our youth culture by suggesting we let herd immunity take its course -  the old (disposable) people would die and we'd be done with it.  Even when that was rejected, caregivers in nursing homes have been allowed to go unvaccinated.   

And if Covid were as disfiguring as smallpox, marking the victims even if they survived, there would have been a stampede to vaccines."

“Trump cares” is an oxymoron, and the only reason there are “Trump vaccines” is because he happened to be president when they were produced. Optics, and nothing more.
Fantasizing about the Left going contrary about something as vital as immunization, something nearly all support unwaveringly, in an effort to “own the Conservatives,” is theatre of the absurd.
Douthat had better be careful about his numbers. This pandemic is far from over. In the near future we could be confronted with a powerful and deadly new strain of virus that could make us long for the good old days of our current situation."

Could not someone have located a couple of bricks and a sheet of plywood?
Whatever the design of the process, it's clear the attendant will do right by his charge.

2021-09-19 11:52:12,"Douthat has this general theory that liberals would protest against anything done by conservatives.   As a liberal, I still base my opinion on what I read from all perspectives, but as an educated ""elite"" liberal, I understand the process of education, which fundamentally involves trying to understand the underlying truth using the time-tested mechanisms that have been developed to get to this truth.  In other words, I follow the science.

As a scientist myself, I understand that the scientific process is still imperfect and can make the wrong call sometimes, but it stil makes an attempt to make the best call at the time.  I curse the weatherman every time he makes me carry an umbrella all day when it doesn't rain, but I still appreciate the fact that the weatherman is just doing the best job that he can, and often when the weatherman gets me to carry an umbrella, it's when he says ""80% chance of rain"" or even ""40% chance of rain"".

Conservative media has bent backwards to paint people with expertise as socialists hell-bent on turning this country into communists, and all they are trying to do is make the best call scientifically.

When Trump was in charge, I had no fear of the vaccine (I would have taken it prior to November 2020 were it available) if the majority of trusted scientists were to say it was safe and effective.  I have yet to meet a liberal who has refused the vaccine because the Trump administration was able to rush the process in order to rush availability."

Initially, at least, opposition to public health measures was rooted in concerns over the injury they might do to the economy.  Since pensioners contribute nothing to gross national product, and subsist on public expense, Republicans felt perfectly comfortable ignoring their plight.  Indeed, I suspect many welcomed the coming retrenchment.  Who better than God to slash the red side of the ledger? 

Of course, this early rhetoric quickly gave way to paranoid denunciations of liberal ""tyranny,"" as it always does.  I can't help wondering, though, if these same ""principles"" could have withstood a similar onslaught from a more diminutive foe.

Furthermore, the only reason Ross and others can still claim to have not lost someone close is highly dependent on the level of care we can access, a level being threatened by those who listen to their revered leaders rather than to see for themselves the stunning truth: almost all dying right now were not vaccinated. “The Right” must admit that it is they who seek and maintain power through international mind control that may even kill those who fall victim."

For the past 50 years, some of the richest and most powerful people in America have been funding political division.  They  created media outlets and think tanks, and tasked them to invent and exploit any issues that will divide the middle class. 
  Because a united middle class is the only force that can diminish their political power and control of the government.
  For an example, imagine what the top corporate and individual tax rates would be if arguments about virus ""freedom,"" abortion, religion, guns, etc.,  were reasonably settled and America's middle class vote was not riven by the so-called social issues that  serve to divide neighbors.

For many others, and this is a source of indifference about the disease, Covid  amounts to sniffles and a headache for a day or two. That said, I remain in favor of following all the current public health guidelines."
2021-09-19 12:43:21,"Covid wouldn't be a problem if it were 10 times deadlier.  The reason it IS such a problem is that mortality is low, permitting infected people to transmit it to others even (perhaps especially) before developing symptoms.

This is why the previous SARS and MERS were not good pathogens.  They were too deadly."

Ross wants us all to know that if the death toll were only significantly higher than 670,000, Republicans would act responsibly - probably. Maybe. Depending on the number. 

So far, right wingers have managed to ignore more than 670,000 deaths, a third wave, zero open ICU beds, children dying more frequently, more businesses closing because of lockdowns, and economic stagnation. None of that is enough. It's clearly suspicious. Thankfully, Fox News, Newsmax, OAN and Qanon saw through the left's devilish ruse! A ruse to... something something rob patriots of freedom. 

Covid has killed more people more quickly than anything since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. How many deaths will be required for Trump and the enablers of the Republican Party like Ross to finally decide to support vaccination and protect their communities? One million? Two million? What should we be shooting for? When does this situation get bad enough for Republicans to treat the pandemic seriously?

Anyway, for sure not enough people have died in the past year and a half to make this a serious issue for the right wing. Not like mandates, which are an overreaction to a disease that's not a big deal.

The good news is Ross seems to think his friends on the right would come around, if only the disease killed more people more quickly."

This was the intentional political messaging of Republicans since Ronald Reagan popularized the notion that ""you are on your won"" is preferable to ""we are all in this together."" Screw the future is what has emerged. 

It is bad enough that the drunken, obese, risky behavior crowd is hell bent on killing themselves. The simple fact is that Covid is spread by these sociopaths. The fact remains, as Hayes pointed out, no matter the death rate, these people don't care who they harm. Sounds criminal to me. Who knows how many lives have been erased by what they falsely call their ""freedoms?""

Covid death ""rate"" will never be acceptable. Not if we truly value human life. And we think the Taliban is cruel?

Just consider that if we behaved more like New Zealand in controlling the virus, the numbers of deaths would be a fraction of out toll. If the public health measures were implemented early on, the total financial costs ( they go on) would be immeasurably lower. Instead, the unvaccinated and the would be assassins of the Michigan Governor, get to hold the entire society hostage to their stupidity.

At that time local communities gave great authority to public health authorities.  This is because they were dealing with a number of ongoing infectious threats.  Smallpox which killed about 1/3 of its victims was present.  In addition there were a number of other infectious diseases which killed about 1/3 of children before they reached their first birthday including the immunization preventable diseases whooping cough and diphtheria.  The framers lived with these terrible diseases every day and gave local public health officials the authority and resources to manage them appropriately

The state-wide limitations put in by republican governors represents a terrible precedent which breaks with this originalist spirit and I find highly hypocritical."
2021-09-19 12:59:07,"Were COVID ten times deadlier, it is at least possible that the additional deaths would fall disproportionately on that segment of the population who refuse to mask and be vaccinated. That would virtually prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that their objections are, indeed, political, and not based on science or the sanctity of life.

Sadly, or not, dead folks can't vote, unless of course they were Cook County residents. All of this could, if one were inclined to do so, be an endorsement of socially Darwinian self-selection, where only the intellectually strong survive. Think what that would do for the future gene pool."

Covid is constantly evolving and mutating - Delta is only one variant. The next Covid variant may well be even more contagious and deadly than Delta...

If and when this particular virus ever ""winds down"" my non-scientific guess is: at least 2.5 million of us will die (at current death rates we'll hit a million by years' end), millions more will deal with ""long covid"", a million will die from lack of hospital beds (crammed with covid patients) and 20% of all medical personnel will either be dead, quit from exhaustion or from being ""forced"" to become vaccinated.

Don't think any of these guesses are too far off base. SAD."
2021-09-19 13:03:13,"Fascinating question.  On a scale of 1 - 10, COVID is a 6, in my opinion.  There could have easily been ten times more deaths if a variant had emerged (or will emerge) that is 10 times more transmissible without being intrinsically more deadly in terms of case-fatality rate.  We see this epidemiological truth played out with Delta. And, as Ross hints at, what if the age risk of a pandemic pathogen were inverted, where infants and children were most at risk.  Remember Zika?

Moreover, the real societal risk comes not just from deaths, but from hospitalization rates.  A pathogen that put 10X more people in hospitals on any given day would have had people dying and rioting in the streets.  SARS-CoV-2 has come very close to exactly that through every surge, so far.  Remember India?

Lastly, what of the next pandemic pathogen, silently evolving in some bat cave, or poultry mega-farm or gain-of-function experiment?  Remember Wuhan Institute of Virology?"
2021-09-19 13:07:48,"It's a good question.  There is a political divide and a regional divide (which also reflects the political divide).  I think much of our political discussion has been about the regional divide (Texas vs. NY) rather than than right wing New Yorkers.

In this context, one key and often ignored characteristic of the 18 month emergency is that for a good portion of the the first half of the pandemic, the number of deaths in the northeast where many times more than in much of the south.  The northeast responded to those numbers and the south responded to their number.  Add to that, the overall death rate from other things in many southern states is persistently  higher than in the northeast, so the impact (change in death rate) was still smaller, and I think you have the beginnings of a non-partisan explanation for the difference.  Of course, there are cultural differences (which translate into partisan differences) of the south (and republicans overall) not trusting government controls as much as the northeast. 

This is not to dispute the obvious point that this disease became political and partisan, but rather to point out that a key reason it became so is because the northeast and the south faced a different set of consequences (as in Ross's question) for much of it.  Now that their numbers are catching up and in some cases surpassing ours, I bet the south's views will become more similar to ours (as we see in increase vaccinations)."

The disease has caused not only many deaths but also prolonged health effects, hospitalizations, and a severe impact on hospitals’ ability to deliver service to all of those needing care. 

I think the better counterfactual would be what if Trump had treated the disease as more than a bothersome pimple on his glorious march to a second term?  What if he had been consistent in his messaging and what if his Administration had been proficient in management of supply logistics and testing?  

Mr. Douthat posits that we would have the same fractures regardless of lethality.  Perhaps.  But would we have the same fractures if Trump had acted like a normal President?  

To answer that counterfactual, one can look at the brief dust up between Republican Governor Kemp of Georgia and Trump.  Trump had supported the lockdown but had waffled because of the economic harm.  Kemp, the obedient Republican, took Trump’s cue and lifted the lockdown prematurely.  Trump suggested “Jump” and his loyal followers wanted to know how high.

Trump injected doubt and promoted divisions.  Had he not unleashed those Furies, would there now be a conservative or liberal approach to this serious disease?"

2021-09-19 13:19:01,"If a virus appeared that was 10xs as lethal as CoVid it would also be more highly infectious.
The initial response would be no different than what we currently went through with CoVid. No one would know rate of infection or lethality for a period of time after the virus appears.  By the time the lethality and infectious nature were discovered, it would be too late.
Society would have collapsed. Welcome to the 12th century.
Lawrence Wright wrote The End Of October in 2019 and published in April 2020. His virus was 10xs more lethal. It is not a pretty story."
2021-09-19 13:21:11,"Ross, this is NOT one of your better columns.  You say, of public health authorities, that ""many bad decisions were made in an atmosphere of panic,"" and elsewhere that people ""panicked too quickly.""  I didn't see much panic in the official responses; I think you're taking the easy way out, not explaining what actually happened.  Let's not over-think the bad shape we're in, and let's not get lost in what-if scenarios."

that one death is a loss to family, friends and society in general.

2021-09-19 13:30:37,"This pandemic, bad as it is, is a trial run for far deadlier pandemics -- and we are not even able to get it under control. What would make us all safer is to prosecute those who spread false information  harmful to others on media. Just as it is against the law to falsely cry fire in a crowded theater, spreading false information and anti-vaccine conspiracies on radio, TV or the internet should result in heavy fines,  and FCC de-licensing. This is not about ""free speech."" Anyone is free to say anything but the bigger the microphone the greater the responsibility. That is why the FCC exists."
2021-09-19 13:33:10,A lot of words and not much insight.  Even anti-mask/anti-vaccination conservatives would be scared into rational behavior if every one of them knew several people who died of COVID-19  (as would be the case if COVID were ten or more times more lethal than it has been so far). The devastation would exceed even their highly developed denial.
2021-09-19 13:33:23,"This pandemic is still going on Ross. Largely because your conservative brethren won’t get vaccinated. Also, public health officials were right not just more right than the folks like Epstein were wrong.  Epstein et al were people with  no background in science  or medicine who should never have been listened to in the first place. But of course the right will amplify any unqualified voice it can find."
2021-09-19 13:35:48,"My feeling is that since there have been around 11%of cases with respect to the population, persons against vaccination feel that a 89% chance of not getting the virus is odds they are willing to chance.  Moreover, since deaths are still a ""small"" percentage of cases, they feel that, like soldiers at war, death will not touch them.  A further aspect that strengthen their posture is the fact that deaths and illnesses are confined to hospitals all over the country.  Were dead bodies be strewn in the streets as in medieval times, the deadly nature of the virus would be much more present and convincing that vaccination could save their lives."
2021-09-19 13:37:29,"Let’s hope when the next pandemic happens we don’t have a Republican President.  The countries who made the worst decisions during Covid were all authoritarian in  either form or function, including the US under Trump."

I think Ross is asking an incredibly important question -- where is the point where someone who simply denies reality comes around? Is there such a point?

670,000 dead is a lot, and probably everyone knows someone who died of COVID, whether they care to admit it or not. But millions of people die every year of various things, most of them older. COVID mostly killed older people, so it doesn't really look that much different than a normal year other than all the liberal panicking.

I agree that people should be willing to mask up and be vaccinated to reduce the toll and help us return to some kind of normal. But if they won't, how do we prepare for one that is 10x worse, which could easily be coming?"
2021-09-19 13:40:49,The right wing will always choose cheap and easy over meeting the true costs and challenges of any crisis. What does it matter if one in 500 has to die in order to keep one in 1000 wealthier than the other 999? To the Trumps of the world not a lot.
2021-09-19 13:42:53,"The problem the left has is that they refuse to say exactly what policy positions Biden should take to deal with the pandemic.  There will always be individuals across the political spectrum who refuse to get vaccinated for personal reasons, but the outcome of the pandemic rests squarely with Biden and he’s failing.  The left doesn’t want to acknowledge this failure and rather seeks to blame Trump supporters.  It’s not working and I suspect the Democrats will pay a price for it in the midterms."
2021-09-19 13:45:32,I think it is worthy to explore the notion if Covid would have been 10x worse (or even twice as bad)! There probably would have been nothing left on grocery store shelves.

2021-09-19 13:45:38,"Mortality above annual average ran 17% in the USA in 2020.
From March 1 - Dec 19 2020  the U.S. experienced 385,100 More Deaths than the average for any of the 5 previous years. Only 316,370 of those extra deaths were reported as Covid-19 deaths. Were the other 68,700 dead actually unreported Covid-19 dead, or were they people with other health crises, unable to access health care because of the strain put on the healthcare system by the Trump bungling of the pandemic? Were people allowed to die or become ill so that Republicans could profit from holdings in testing and treatment stocks? Pandemic profiteering? Chaos economics? Buying up housing stock of foreclosed families? Picking up cheap companies left foundering during shut-downs, interrupted supply chains, staffing disruptions."
2021-09-19 13:45:46,"Interestingly, we don't have to address this as a hypothetical matter.  Numerically, NY deaths were 10 times higher than most of the south in the first wave and for a period after that.  We can see the difference.  The south took it much less seriously, until they caught up (now).  Also, in terms of lessons, we should note that when NY had a death rate that was 10 times worse (than the south), it came together and through lockdowns brought the death rate to essentially zero.  That was an amazing feat.  Except then NY let up a its death rate numbers increased again to levels comparable to Texas now.

I was with you until this sentence Mr Douthat. Where have you been for the last 6 months! It’s 40, 50, 60 year olds dying! Moms and dads with kids in high school or college. Office workers. Engineers working from home. Teachers. Radio hosts. We run out of options like ecmo to save them, and most of the time can’t if it gets to that anyway. We haven’t seen nursing home outbreaks nearly as much as early 2020 due to high resident vaccine uptake."
2021-09-19 13:47:37,"I’m afraid it’s too late already.

As a physician, I still try every single day to convince the unvaccinated. They walk around in our clinics with their masks off or half-off, just daring us to say something. They sneer when urged to get vaccinated and say they aren’t concerned at all and that if it’s “my time, it’s my time.” They don’t care that they can kill their grandmother or their neighbor or themselves. They claim to know better than physicians. It’s honestly exhausting and disheartening, and every day I ask myself is it worth it to try and have all that aggravation? Moreover, for the past two Saturdays, there are been big college football game days with tailgating and a packed stadium with apparently no mask or vaccination mandates. Is it any wonder that people don’t understand the full extent of danger? 

Meanwhile, literally right next to the stadium and parking lots, is the hospital: full of Covid patients with average age 38, dying, on diversion. And the public doesn’t know or doesn’t care."
2021-09-19 13:48:45,"The economic structure of our country, the USA, has ""developed"" into the traditional economic structure of a third world country with widespread poverty at the bottom, massive wealth at the top, and a middle class that struggles in stagnation or decline, while political leadership, including the Supreme Court, perpetuates this arrangement.  Our health system mirrors this structure.  There is massive misappropriation and misdirection of health care resources.  There are no adequate structures to address a pandemic, now or in the future. There is no leadership or political will to do anything about it.  We simply lack a public health system, and we lack a communal commitment to develop one. 
See The August 30 New Yorker for Atul Gawande's compelling report on the public health system in Costa Rica, developed over the past 40 years, that has successfully addressed the pandemic while achieving health care outcomes that exceed the USA.   Costa Rica has a communal commitment to public health that is reflected in its political leadership. There is none of the destructive discourse and debate amplified by the media that now permeates our political and social life her in the USA."
2021-09-19 13:49:02,"SARS has a lethality of about 10%. It had the fortunate symptomatic trend where people felt sick before they were infectious. ""If you are sick, stay Home"" worked to stop the spread. 

MERS has a lethality of about 35%. It is so rare that we have little experience with it. 

SARS, MERS, and Covid are all different coronovirus diseases in humans. SARS is not circulating in humans currently. MERS has hardly circulated ever. Covid is currently widely transmitted in humans.

There would be more fear if a more lethal coronavirus was circulating, and the obvious deaths would lead to more public health concern. Covid is a relatively benign pandemic, which makes it possible to argue for ignoring it, and accepting a twist of fate. 

Pandemics are rare. And the last two have been somewhat benign."
2021-09-19 13:49:29,"(Ross, we were prepared for THIS pandemic. It's just that the administrators in power at the time didn't want to stop it.)

However, the headline is correct. Since March 2020, I've been saying that the problem is Covid isn't killing enough people. Don't misunderstand me: It's not that I wanted an even worse death toll, but it was quickly apparent that it wasn't frightening enough to get anybody, politicians and citizenry alike, to really change their behavior."
2021-09-19 13:49:33,"A ten-fold increase in the infection rate would have meant an earlier and more visible covid effect in rural areas but higher morbidity with no difference in the infection rate would have brought no change in the type of groups and regions affected only in the severity of the effect.
More then along political lines, the scissor cut along the rural/urban line which happens to align closely with political lines.
Dense urban populations necessitate that civilized life requires more concessions and this, I think, explains the libertarian flavor of the Right's objections."
2021-09-19 13:49:41,"Death is personal.  It needs to happen to you if you're skeptical of the risk.  Examples are the many who become vaccine supporters after they lose a loved one or nearly die themselves.

New media has the job of communicating with the public.  It needs to be more succinct and clever about targeting the social dynamics of each population.

For instance, in Alabama, you would need to talk about football to get the readers attention.  Say something like: The number of people in Alabama who've died of Covid in proportion to the population of Alabama is like going to a Crimson Tide home game of 101,850 people and 261 of them died.  Imagine one fellow fan on each yard line on both sidelines and 30 more in each end zone.   Imagine the whole state like a football stadium!   Maybe suggest a moment of to honor those 261 people at every game.   One of every 360 people in Alabama has died of Covid."
2021-09-19 13:49:45,"Arguably Covid’s death rate makes it a perfect scissor: It’s high enough to make the alarmed feel vindicated, but still low enough that many skeptics feel vindicated as well.

Six hundred thousand plus American dead in eighteen months ought to get and hold anyone's attention, but perhaps it's the sort of people who've been dying from COVID-19 (the elderly, the enfeebled, people of colour, the impoverished) that matters in the end. If it were the wealthiest who were dying in such disproportionate numbers stopping this disease would be at the top of everyone's to do list - they'd make darn sure of that!"
2021-09-19 13:53:50,"Covid was exaggerated all along. From the initial 3.4% death rate the WHO publicized frantically, through the counting of everyone who tested positive for Covid as dying of Covid (including 90 year old cancer patients), through the fact that it is far more dangerous for children to ride in a motor vehicle than it is for them to catch Covid. We should do all that we can to help and save those that are ill, but we should take a step back and see that the disease is far less severe than what was originally thought 18 months ago."
2021-09-19 13:56:01,"Douthat's essential contrarian nature clearly leads him in paths not of righteousness but of dystopia. His clear predilection to view everything through a political lens; meaning that everything is dependent on political orientation, not on facts, justice, or even mercy. In this case, he continues the Trumpian view that COVID was essentially a political event that had unfortunate consequences for a few people, not unlike an insurrection--collateral damage measured in casualties, but not consequential. The politics are the important part.
As always, Douthat, in this approach, approaches the insane. He is not simply wrong, he is intentionally, maliciously, wrong and does not care about the consequences for individuals. What matters to him, and to his slightly more strident ilk of DeSantis, Abbott, Trump, etc, is that he  claims and holds power, even if it is just of ideas."
2021-09-19 13:56:43,"None of this explains why Republicans are more likely than Democrats to be against both vaccine mandates AND vaccines. In terms of mandates, while there is a small libertarian faction in the party, by and large Republicans tend to be more supportive of government control than Democrats. Many Republicans support  anti-pot, anti-gay sex, anti-needle exchange and even  anti-birth control laws. And after 9/11, a tragedy that resulted in  many fewer deaths than Covid, Republicans were more likely to support restrictive legislation.  Two Republican governors forced a nurse who had worked with Doctors Without Borders with  Ebola patients into involuntary quarantine even though she was not positive for the disease. And during the Ebola scare many Republican's argued for travel restrictions and quarantines for every healthcare worker who saw an Ebola patient.
But even if one accepts that Republicans have become more libertarian and therefore don't support mandates, why do so many of them refuse to take the vaccine? After all, Trump claimed that ""Warf Speed"" was one of his major accomplishments.  And he advise people to take the vaccine.  These anti-vaxxers are basically saying that the Trump effort resulted in a faulty and even dangerous product."
2021-09-19 13:57:27,"I have often wondered how high the death toll would need to be to get the highest vaccination compliance rate. I have been very surprised at the number of people who are refusing the vaccine. It is very eye opening. 

I also spend a lot of time thinking about “what if”. What if there was 80% vaccine uptake in the population by July/August of this year? I wonder what the outcome would have been. 

I do hope the vaccination numbers continue to creep up over the coming months but, I cant see how the numbers can possibly get high enough to eradicate Covid before another powerful variant arrives."
2021-09-19 13:57:33,"The effect of Covid on politic in India may be instructive. The first wave left the recently risen Hindu nationalism unthreatened, despite obvious mismanagement. The reason was that the disaster didn't change any of the dynamics of caste and class and distribution. The effects were felt disproportionally by the poor and disenfranchised, as usual.
The Second Wave (delta driven) is worse, and the suffering has less respect for class lines. Recent elections there suggest that Hindu nationalist iconicism has lost it's grip on the middle class. Good governance and women's empowerment are both rising issues.

The prospect of future pandemic, which may be less focused on the old and the crowded, could produce analogous changes in U.S. politics."
2021-09-19 13:57:40,"Mr. D.,

I heard your discussion with Andrew Sullivan, and know you think that the Republican (Pro-Death-Party) is bonkers, and likely would act just as they are regardless of the death rate - as long as a Democrat is in charge.

Do recall that this pandemic is not over yet - the longer there are unvaccinated people around the virus is busy evolving and creating more effective versions of itself to get around the vaccines we have already created.  The Delta variant is not the end of the story.  I expect we will have another varient and more hospital systems being overwhelmed before the end of the year.

And, as for the next pandemic - I don't think we have 20 years.

Wearing a mask is a bit more of a bother than hiding under a desk in preparation for a nuclear bomb, and infinitely more effective."
2021-09-19 13:59:45,"A big factor in the response to Covid is that children were relatively unaffected.  If Covid would have been deadly to children in the same way it was deadly to the elderly, it would have been a tragedy for sure, but it would have united both sides of the political spectrum.  In this way we were extremely lucky that Covid spared children for the most part."

Polio numbers are dwarfed by the sheer number of cases and deaths from Covid.  But instead of striking down old people, large numbers of children were stricken with devastating results. There was even the iron lung, which cost as much as a house and was the ultimate fear of any family. 

So the answer to your question is that given a younger age of those dying, people would take Covid as serious.  Throw in a bunch of children on respirators and people would change their attitudes.  It’s all about optics, in a certain manner."

But at a moral level, those who hopefully made stupid miscalculations to support their ""side"" are one thing.  But at this point, those who pretend to reject facts and reality, and demagogue about protecting the ""freedoms"" of a selfish and poorly informed minority while sacrificing the rights of the majority are another.

This is only a partial list.

I imagine that the response to it would have been quite different, even if the mortality rate were lower than it actually has been.  We have a disease where some people go off to die in hospitals, not without pain and suffering, but basically out of sight, and out of mind.

We’ve already seen the virus mutate such that it is 1,000 times more communicable than the original strain. As this country is full of idiots who refuse to take a free, safe, and effective vaccine (because “freedom” and/or to “own the libs”), there is no reason to expect that this virus, now globally dispersed, won’t mutate and become even more likely to kill or cause lasting damage to millions more. The reasons that related viruses have disappeared were because they infected a limited population and killed their human hosts too quickly to spread, not because a vaccine was developed to protect against them. Thanks to people who reject science, COVID-19 keeps spreading and people keep dying. We may yet see as many people die as would have at the beginning if the virus had been ten times deadlier.

2021-09-19 14:17:46,"A little more than hand-waving statistical analysis is required, but not provided here. In the early days of the pandemic not only governors from Maine to NY, NJ, FL, TX, and CA and Trump were forced to act fast without knowing whether Covid was 1.0x, or 10.0x. or 0.1x as bad as it turned out to be. (600K or 6MM or 60K deaths to date).

Worse yet, it took months to learn enough about Covid to effectively test large numbers, and for doctors to learn how to treat which patients. Thus, decision-makers were left with a stark choice: risk erring on the side of caution or on the side of 'do as little as possible, it's just like the flu'. In hindsight nobody got it 100% right, nor should we have expected them to.

But our current political storm Requires that one be exactly right or one is totally wrong. So here we are 19 months later with both sides blaming the other for not knowing what nobody knew yet in Feb.-Mar. 2020. The only tool we had that worked was statistics, but good stat takes time, not tweets. Meanwhile, partisans hurled factiod thunderbolts during a presidential campaign.

BTW, if it had been 10x worse, by May 2020 we would have seen the world-wide healthcare system implode, and vastly greater lockdowns than we actually did, and calls for Former Guy to cancel the election ...

2021-09-19 14:19:29,"Counterfactuals may be instructive in hindsight, but who cares what may have happened if this or that had been different when in the middle of a crisis, which this pandemic remains? My guess is that the pundits that predicted 50 times less death have already convinced themselves that those people would have died anyway, or the lockdown killed more, in some kind of long-winded political counterfactual loaded with bias confirming narratives of their own making. These counterfactual narratives make good columns and TV, I suppose, but they are invariably exercises in rationalization and myth-making. Something that people are much more interested in (what people should have done) rather than simply acknowledging mistakes and moving on with fact-based current solutions. It’s all part of the big show, these counterfactuals. They do get the pulse going and the brain defensive, in any event. Leaving them to historical debate later and getting on with pandemic policy is probably a better use of political energy."

My 2 year old son has respiratory issues and Covid is especially dangerous for him. I really wish commentators would stop saying how “Covid isn’t that bad for kids” and instead encourage more responsibility. It’s easy to instead say “even though hospitalizations for kids are low, there are a lot of children for whom Covid is deadly.” And it’s easy to use that to reinforce and encourage continued efforts to mitigate spread of the disease. 

Every time someone diminishes the severity of Covid, it extends the pandemic and keeps my son’s life in danger."
2021-09-19 14:21:24,"Ask yourself this ...

A virus, pretty much unknown in its mechanistic mode of infection, is exhibiting what appears to be lethal outcomes among infected humans.

Compare and contrast with the running theme of the ""Dirty Harry"" movie, in which someone facing the muzzle of the magnum is asked the question:

""Do you feel lucky?"" 

If one is responsible for the public health (CDC officials), is it prudent to err on caution rather than hope for luck? At least if the public health officials are wrong and are over-protective, no one is irreparably harmed."
2021-09-19 14:23:30,"I think Chris Hayes’ opinion reflects the impression that the scissor is a  response to facts themselves — where Covid is the test case rather than the cause.

One party’s entire identify is constructed  on myths that are threatened by facts.   Trickle down economics doesn’t work. Government help is not the problem.  No one is threatening Christmas.  Racism persists.  Taxes aren’t waste.   Neither god, nationalism, nor conservative tribalism will make you immune to the consequences of infection by a virus.  

The other party is hardly perfect.  It’s supporters tend to overemphasise the power of an academic education which seeks to understand change, respect science, and appreciate that we can learn from history.

Ross’ preference for counterfactuals (over factuals?) is a preference for solipsistic thought experiments and identify over public policy as a way for a group of people to address difficulties and improve their quality if life."
2021-09-19 14:23:44,"Mr. Douthat too casually borrows an argument about control measures being more or less popular based on the degree to which we more or less lose control of the disease.  In the case of infectious diseases like Covid 19, physical distancing, masks, and vaccines all work better before a disease spreads in a community. Failure to control may motivate popular and political thought, but it still fails to control disease transmission. Worse, if leaders are foolish enough to ignore control tactics after experiencing ""ten times worse"", cases will continue to grow and the virus may mutate beyond original control measures. Smart early is best. Smart late is better than never smart."
2021-09-19 14:24:25,"Ten times deadlier might have convinced a handful of anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and COVID hoaxers.

Imagine if the virus caused buggy, twitchy or droopy eyes, constant drooling, chronic incontinence, severe full-body excema, or any number of other ""worse"" outcomes than the many post-COVID and long COVID symptoms that we keep hearing about.  Imagine if the virus caused profound ED in men!

I'll wager that a non-fatal virus capable of causing long-term damage that humiliates and emasculates its victims while making them physically unattractive would scare a lot more doubters into getting vaxxed and wearing masks."
2021-09-19 14:25:24,"The worst thing about the pandemic, from a public health (rather than individual) perspective is that the virus can be transmitted before you show symptoms, and that you can even remain completely asymptomatic and still pass it on. If it weren't for that, the virus could be 10 times more lethal, and we'd still be in better shape than we are today."
2021-09-19 14:25:42,"I have wondered if the pandemic were more like small pox or the black plague that visibly disfigured victims, there would have been more cooperation in a vaccine campaign.  We can read about people sufficating in hospitals and it sounds horrible, but seeing on the news carefully edited videos of health care workers tunring people over somehow does not seem as horrifying as it really must be."
2021-09-19 14:29:04,"Ross presents this as choice based on politics. What about a counterfactual exercise about those who believe in science?  What if we just created a society where more people understood and valued the scientific process that has always led to big leaps forward in healthcare and every other industry (space, automobiles, computers, mobile devices, AI, etc etc)."
2021-09-19 14:30:17,"We do have a real test coming up with Biden mandating vaccines for all companies with 100 or more employees or, in my state, and even more urgent test of vaccine mandates.  Gov. Jay Inslee has mandated vaccinations for government employees and the response has been a warning from police unions of massive numbers of police quitting their jobs or being fired for not complying.  Just yesterday on a drive south to Tacoma to visit my son and his boyfriend there were three freeway over passes with people protesting with signs saying ""let us work.""  Would things be different if the death rate were 10 times higher?  Who knows but it is far past time to require vaccination to work.  You have freedom to risk your own life but not to endanger others."
2021-09-19 14:32:02,"It is ironic that Mr. Douthat would make the following assertion right after describing how some conservatives were so wrong about the seriousness and potential magnitude of the pandemic:

“Today it’s clear that the public-health authorities got all kinds of things wrong, and many bad decisions — especially about closing schools — were made in an atmosphere of panic.”

This is more of the same, challenging the credibility of public health officials, and disputing the need for measures to fight the pandemic, in this case after the pandemic has ravaged the county instead of before.

My assessment is that the public health authorities got it right, especially regarding the urgency of taking measures to limit the spread of the disease, based upon what was known and unknown at the time about the novel Coronavirus.   What they got wrong, and continue to get wrong, is assessing the capacity of certain politicians and their adherents to resist the measures required to limit the pandemic."

2021-09-19 14:32:50,"I was way ahead of the curve when it came came to Covid for two reasons one as a daily reader of the NYT I was reading stories about it when it was strictly a Wuhan China problem. Second I travel to China and have many coworkers there and have been to Wuhan and felt a connection to it. 

As China shutdown the whole Wuhan region I was at first shocked but having a little familiarity with SARS from 20 years ago I figured it was probably the right thing to do at the time since there were so many unknowns. At this point I remember thinking well what China is doing is choosing public health over their economy. Imagine that a dictatorship basically choosing life over money. So it was apparent you could have public health or an economy but not both at the same time until the pandemic was under control. Around the first week of March while discussing the situation in China I asked a couple of American coworkers what would Trump choose public health or the economy? All three replied the economy I said exactly and so plan accordingly. And it’s pretty much played out as I expected."
2021-09-19 14:41:06,The original SARS virus had a death rate of 15 percent. The only way we survived was that the original SARS was far less transmissible than Covid-19.  If it was as transmissible as the delta varient it would be havoc.
2021-09-19 14:44:07,"Nice example of the process of cerebration in making an experience unreal. ""What if Covid were 10 times deadlier?"" As soon as Douthat expresses it, an alienation takes place, and the full experience has already been substituted for the word.   This general process of cerebration (the working of the brain; thinking) is more widespread and intense in modern culture than any other time in history.  Increasing emphasis on intellectual knowledge which is a condition for technical and scientific achievements, and in connection with it on literacy and education, words more and more take the place of experience. Yet we are unaware of this. We think we see something, feel something, but there's no experience except memory and thought.  The brain-self grasps it but the whole person, eyes, hands, belly, grasp nothing -- in fact they are not participating in the experience which they believe is theirs. 

The question should be: what happens when I become aware of what I was not aware of before? To become conscious of what is unconscious means to get in touch with reality, and with truth (intellectually and affectedly.  To enlarge consciousness - wake up, lift the veil, leave the cave,  As Spinoza pointed out, intellectual knowledge is only conducive to change only inasmuch as it also affective knowledge."

2021-09-19 14:47:28,Let’s be clear on the science. As new variants emerge it is entirely possible that one could emerge that is significantly deadlier than the original variant. Why is this  so difficult for people to understand?
2021-09-19 14:47:38,"It's not just if ""Covid was 10-times worse"" in terms of deaths. That misses the point of dissention. Sure, this virus has an +/- 80% asymptomatic profile and the recovery rate is extrememly high. But it's the demographics of the virus. 
Those with morbidities die at a hugely higher rate than the healthy.  More men than women, more POC than whites, poor vs wealthy, and more definitively, the virus strikes the elderly. 
As of August 18, 95% of all Covid deaths were over age 50.  We see states where 30-60% of all deaths were in nursing homes. And for those under age 17 less than 400 have died. 
These vagaries play out in states like Oregon where 776 deaths/M were recorded vs. New York with 2,827/M.
Given the profile and demographics, we can look back to a March 20, 2020 op-ed in the NYT by Dr. David Katz to understand the divisiveness created by the response to Covid
<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html</a>
Instead of a targeted response geared to the at-risk and elderly, population-wide lockdowns, school closings, small business devastation and what many perceive as throwing the poor and ""essential workers"" under the bus became the no-end-in-sight strategy. Those able to work from home went almost unscathed.
There in lies the more complicated picture of what-if."
2021-09-19 14:47:49,"Unfortunately,  public heath responses, to be effective at containing infectious disease must be taken early, BEFORE the facts become absolutely  clear about the nature of the disease.   Once there are enough cases to form a reliable picture, the genie is already out of the bottle.  A society which does not trust its government to take actions that are difficult and drastic when outbreaks are still contained or less lethal in order to mitigate what MIGHT develop  will never be able to quickly and efficiently stem the tide of pandemics.  The need for action in the face of such uncertainties is a perfect storm for whipping up our tribal distrust of each other and our government.  A 10% increase in a death rate perhaps would help to unite our response, but I'm afraid that this would be after 10% of the population was already gone.  Climate change is another good example.  We have to act before we are certain and that takes a highly educated, forward thinking and united people interested in the common good- unfortunately this does not describe America."
2021-09-19 14:48:12,"Here Douthat is expounding on an idea based on numerous assumptions. 

But rather than argue against his assumptions, why not look at the data from the control group. We have one, it's called Sweden.

From the beginning Sweden took a different approach. No lockdowns, voluntary social distancing, masks optional, and a real effort to ""flatten the curve.""

They were condemned by nearly everyone, especially from this paper. And, to be fair, the data shows two major flaws in the Swedish approach.

First, they failed to isolate and protect their elder care facilities. The New York state experience shows they were hardly alone in that mistake.

Secondly, they didn't actively pursue viable treatment options. Again our own CDC failed miserably on that count.

But when you control for the eldercare facility deaths you have a case fatality rate below most of their western counterparts, including the US.

Their schools remained open and according to the NEJM had a zero case fatality rate among students and an infection rate among teachers of only .43%.

Their kids didn't lose a years as ours have. Their economy did suffer as ours has. They had a compressive public health response, fully explained to their citizens that existed them in the effort.

They knew natural immunity was a key long term goal and vaccines were a part of that plan rather than the whole  plan.

The reason we hear little about this control group is because in many respects it produced better results than our own."
2021-09-19 14:48:15,"Douthat may like counterfactuals, but there’s no escaping the old tautology about them:
“If things weren’t as they are, they would have been otherwise.”

Given the endless capacity for mendacity in the Right’s favorite news outlet - which we may treat like Voldemort here, there is, as Chris Hayes said, no reason to suppose that a greater fatality and morbidity rate  would have made any difference in their messaging. The Big Lie exceeds the size of any truth if it is advantageous to the Big Liars. There is no counterfactual to that.
That is just how things are, despite Douthat’s sophistry."
2021-09-19 14:48:28,"i don't know where Ross has been lately, but covid is already 10X more deadly financially as more and more insurance companies have or will soon reinstate co-pays and deductibles to the tune of $7 to 100 thousand depending on your circumstances. and this comes on top of a concerted effort by republicans to make homelessness a criminal offense. so much for the party of protecting life."
2021-09-19 14:16:31,"Once again forgotten what a the strain this pandemic has placed on the healthcare system and providers. Just as we have ignored the soldiers who fought and died in Iraq and Afghanistan while we went about our lives, those who refuse to take prudent measures to reduce transmission rates willfully ignore the healthcare workers who fight to keep the seriously ill alive. The physical and emotional toll is swept under the rug for its too damning to acknowledge."

2021-09-19 13:30:51,"Ross Douthat is craven!
At first Trump talked about something like 60,000 dying and that was an acceptable number.
It IS ten times more. But people just adjust to the numbers and think that if it went to 1 million it would be terrible. (Remember when it was 200,000, a number even Fauci thought would be the top!).
Humans are capable of normalizing almost anything. 
So Ross-- NO -- ten times more would just be normalized and rationalized, just like you are doing. NYT why do you publish such craven and anti-human garbage."
2021-09-19 14:48:52,"You won't convince me otherwise that Trump (probably convinced by Kushner) concluded very early on since COVID was disproportionately affecting Blue states, and it was an election year, that the best course of action was to politicize the issue to maximize their chances of winning a second term.

And EVERYTHING since has flowed from that decision. 

Remember Trump's famous tweet asking why the Federal government had to ""bail out the Blue states"" ?"
2021-09-19 14:21:15,"Had Trump embraced the role of a COVID tsar, he would (sadly) still be President and we would likely be in better shape, but stupid is as stupid does and here we sit, surrounded by disease and idiocy in equal measure."
2021-09-19 13:25:40,"You can bet that if Muslim terrorists were detonating biological weapons that killed 2000 Americans daily, and the only way to stop them was to wear masks and get vaccinated, the Right would be all over it.  They would label any person who refused to wear a mask a traitor and probably call for mass executions of the unvaccinated."

2021-09-19 04:11:05,"If the death rate was 10 times more than current catastrophic rate Mr. Douthat would have written a different version with intellectual gymnastics to convince himself and fellow truth deniers, anti-science, and selfish so called conservative libertarians who have no interest in any policy or mandate unless it has to do with women rights to control their bodies, to waste billions of dollars on police brutality, voter suppression, and defence budget. What governors of Florida and Texas and many other republican governor are advocation and doin is beyond belief and shameful."
2021-09-19 11:20:53,"Douthat can’t even get the basic facts right. Richard Epstein of the Hoover Institute initially predicted a maximum of 500 deaths, not 5,000. He later increased it to 5,000 and kept going up from there, without ever really acknowledging or apologizing for being so wrong."
2021-09-18 21:19:06,Ten times deadlier?  Not a pipe dream.  That could happen if people don't get vaccinated - dangerous mutations are evolving.  I can tolerate fools but not when the result of their foolishness is a possible end of humanity.
2021-09-19 12:41:53,"It's pretty simple; 'No Restrictions' means Open Season for Viral Pneumonia Covid-19' to a Republican. The same policy to any sane American (not 'liberals') means ""they're more interested in opening gyms and body rub parlors (and forcing meat packers to risk death), than protecting themselves or the country.""

The only question is by how much. And the second question is how long will it take until every unvaxxed adult is either sick, dying, dead or a carrier of COVID?"
2021-09-19 13:47:16,"What if Covid was 10 times deadlier? Well, we wouldn't have to worry about all those Republican deniers, those conspiracy believers, those FREEDOM resisters.

Our freedom without responsibility is why we are where we are."

2021-09-19 14:18:28,"It doesn't matter how deadly COVID has been, is, or will be in the future: regardless, Republican politicians like McConnell, McCarthy, Abbott and DeSantis don't care whether you live or die. In fact, chaos and fear benefit them, so they traffic in deliberate lies to gain and stay in power. If, in the meantime, they destroy the economy, democracy, and people's lives, they're fine with that. Just fine."
2021-09-19 04:53:35,"The main difference in an individual’s, or a groups response to Covid is not political, but religious. As Governor Tate, of Mississippi, correctly pointed out: those who believe in internal life are not so concerned about their health and safety. 

This simple but often overlooked fact nicely explains many of the divisions in our society. If you think that you will be “saved” when you die, you are not that interested in gun control, or getting vaccinated, or healthy eating. The secular often miss this point. 

Religious people often refer to funerals as “Home Comings” and to death as “Traveling.” Their sadness is the sadness of a loved one moving across the world, rather than the sadness of someone ending. 

Religion shapes politics, of course, so the two are related. But the people who are not afraid of Covid are the same people who think the world is only a few thousand years old, that Adam and Eve were the parents of all humans, and that one day the Messiah will come and redeem those who are worthy. 

What is they’re right?"
2021-09-18 19:23:46,"If the death rate were 10x higher, it would not have spread as widely.   Would have burned itself out.  Ebola comes to mind, much deadlier but wouldn’t spread as much."
2021-09-19 14:51:33,"I hate to be the bearer of bad new, but this pandemic is not over yet. A new strain could erupt any day that is ten time more deadly. People with the vaccine might find themselves with a small fraction of the protection they have enjoyed, while the unvaccinated will overwhelm our healthcare system. 
  It is not the time or place to be writing articles that imply we are out of the woods."

Which killed 30 to 40%  of Europe's population during the 14th century. Even at those astronomical death figures, we would still have anti-vaxxers still  resistant to taking a free FDA approved life saving shot. Even as their dead family members were being collected up via wheel barrel."

2021-09-18 21:19:33,"Why did some people, many with right-wing views, declare the pandemic a hoax? I think part of the answer is that they were concerned about the economic impact and built the case against fearing COVID on that foundation. 
Trump himself had a brief episode of taking the pandemic seriously. He never said that he had been wrong, but there was at least one press conference when it looked as if he had become a believer. 
DeSantis in Florida was similarly respectful of the disease. He went so far as to close Florida's beaches and tried to stop infectious New Yorkers from entering the state. 
Both quickly decided that the economy was more important than public health. It would have been different, perhaps, if they had urged people to take the disease seriously, wear masks and keep socially distant. I think they failed to do that because many of the ""base"" thought wearing a mask was wussy. 
There has been a lot of confusion about COVID. Some of that was inevitable, but some has been purposely planted to divide the country. Who benefits?"
2021-09-19 00:57:02,"Douthat once again twists himself into pretzel logic hypothesizing a nonexistent progressive failure in an attempt to take the heat off the miserable way trump and his red state sycophants have botched the handling of Covid from the beginning.  

And where is the mention of the star of the conservative Hoover Institute’s misinformation campaign, the nueroradiologist, Scott Atlas, trump’s chief advisor, who had no credentials in epidemiology, infectious disease or virology; and proved it every time he opened his reckless mouth?  Did you forget about him, Ross?  Or just hoped people forgot."
2021-09-19 03:10:45,It might not work out to being ten times deadlier but there are about 10 million COVID deaths in India and China that have gone unreported.

When people see the overflowing pediatric ICUs then they will realize the magnitude. In Italy, the funeral vans brought that home, in India the cremation pyres.
If you want a precise number, in the absence of ER visuals, the case count will need to be high enough for people to be dropping in the streets. Sad!"
2021-09-19 02:13:32,"Oh, fun.  

So, Ross, do you remember the early days?  The EMT’s in the greater metro area hauling critically ill people, many not making it, day after day, night after night?  Wow.  The horror of the morgue trucks?  

Yeah.  Let’s make it more fun and think of it now being 10 times worse. 

Actually, let’s not.  

Agreed.  Would be great to be planning for the next pandemic.  Instead, we aren’t out of this one yet.  And we could have been.  

But nope, folks would rather go blathering on about stuff like how wearing masks is the real problem."

2021-09-19 12:39:54,"It’s interesting that your fear is a counterfactual fantasy 20 years in the future. My fear is that right now my unvaccinated conservative relatives could fall victim to COVID 19 because they’ve take in  the messaging of GOP leaders, unregulated social media, and conservative television following the whims of the anti-vaxxers. My next fear is that someone you or I care about will need an ICU bed (for any reason) when there are none. And my third fear is for our global neighbors for whom the vaccine rollout has come much more slowly. Your tone suggests to me that thinking of endless counterfactuals to “catch” liberals allows you to distance yourself from the current pain."
2021-09-18 22:38:59,"I wonder how many people actually died from Covid-19 in Florida? I doubt we'll ever know. Our governor seized control of the raw data early on and we in the public get... well, whatever he feels like giving us."

2021-09-19 04:19:49,"Odd not to mention the obvious, that the early predictions of lower deaths were based on the idea of a competent governmental response. You know, like ebola, which could have been even more devastating by far, than covid.

We're well over 500% beyond what might have been charitably expected if there were no Republicans."

2021-09-19 14:56:17,Covid is already 10 times deadlier to the unvaccinated than the vaccinated. How much difference is that making?  Some people have been groomed to ignore the facts.
2021-09-19 14:56:16,"A feature of viruses with pandemic potential is that they do not have super high death rates.  A high death rate generally limits the amount of spread because we die before we give it to someone else.  This combination of transmissibility and relatively low mortality rates is exactly what makes certain viruses able to seed a global pandemic. They can spread like wildfire without a huge death signal and then the relatively low mortality rate becomes quite large due to the sheer volume of people who are infected.

It's a nice idea to think about a counterfactual but you have to root it in reality so you don't miss the lessons that pandemics have to teach.  What makes a certain virus ""pandemic worthy"" is also the same thing that makes it politically difficult to address.  Acting early, on low case rates, with low death rates with what seem to be draconian policies is the right move.  We know now what exponential growth curves look like. And yes, that means that in retrospect you have to trust that the cost of inaction would have been crushing and yet, even though you saw only a fraction of it.  We cannot get around those core lessons and I fear that because we are not learning them this time around, we have little chance of preventing future pandemics."

A COVID variant pops up with 10% mortality. China shuts down like the did at the beginning of the pandemic and avoids the worst effects. The U.S. does what it has already done in the name of freedumb, suffers 10 to 20 million dead and the social structure and economy collapses. We can’t borrow from the world and we go bankrupt. In 2050 the 21st century is being called the Chinese century.

2021-09-19 14:59:58,"I agree with Chris Hayes. The response to COVID19 comes from two different deep-seated beliefs.

Conservative belief: authorities and experts aren't to be trusted. Only look to your in-group of family, friends and local community, especially your church. An email from a Facebook ""friend"" is more trustworthy than a public service message from your local hospital.

Liberal belief: authorities and experts with a good track record can be trusted. Look to decades of science and the cooperative structures of civilization (hospitals, government institutions like the CDC, respected leaders, etc.) for assistance. A public service message from your local hospital is more trustworthy than an email from a Facebook ""friend"" who might really be a computer bot.

If COVID19 had been 10 times worse, we'd have more people shooting each other in the streets due to the overwhelming collapse of society. A lot of the guns bought by the paranoid would be in use--American against American."
2021-09-19 14:29:26,"Three points, Mr. Douthat:

1. Stop bashing liberals just because they're liberals.  It's grown tiresome, and it makes you look petty and small.

2. The Covid-19 response:  It wasn't panic.  It was caution in the face of a catastrophic disease.  Better safe than sorry.

3. School closings: Dead students learn NOTHING."

It's absolutely clear what we need: an end to vaccine resistance and production of vaccines in quantities that can be distributed across the globe for free. 

Ross, you are a Catholic. As you know, Catholicism asks its adherents to perform good works. There is no better work you could do than to use your privileged position as a Times columnist to speak out, repeatedly, humbly, and sincerely, to the anti-vaxxers and help convince them to mend their ways."

2021-09-18 23:43:16,"How I understand it, Covid-19 is still just a corona virus, it won't mutate to be as deadly as say, Ebola, but it can get very more transmissable and cause development of other serious symptoms. So if this is the case then if you are vaxxed and get  boosters, you theoretically are pretty safe from a severe outcome.
No matter how bad it will get, anti vaxxers will not get vaxxed, you have only to look at the talk show hosts, and others who died spewing anti vax misinformation.
Pretty soon the death rate will only apply to the un vaxxed, this in turn will winnow down the anti vax population.
Up until now, I just didn't see the upside to this whole anti vax anti mask movement."

Or is there some place in that suspect mind that imagines there's some advantage in preventing the planet from realizing the scope of your wisdom and insight?

I hope not the latter because, dude, you would be wrong.

Take this hypothetical for example: ""... and liberals turned anti-lockdown in response, or one where Trump won re-election and hesitation over the “Trump vaccine” ended up stronger on the left""

It's not actually a hypothetical, see.  It's an impossible.  That's not what liberals or Democrats or Progressives or whatever slur you wish to employ today do.

Should Don Don the Great, No Really return, as prophecies foretell, and offer a COVID solution and should Liberals (we'll do it your way for now), after epic confrontation, weeping, gnashing and telepathically expressed mockery of blond(ish) women and people from Kentucky, political people at least, arrive at a consensus to disagree with The Leader of The Free Market World, you would hear verbal argument, powerful oratory, and the resultant keening of leftist politicos, firm resolve to do something one day, and a Tsunami of swish-swish-swish as lavishly shod Liberal feet race across expensive carpetry in quest of Navy Bean Soup.

That's if things go really bad.

2021-09-19 14:22:37,"When Ross notes that no one he knows has died of COVID, as if that were the criterion for public policy, he captures perfectly the selfishness that dominates Republicans' thinking. Remember that R representative who spewed anti-gay hate till his own son came out? Ross lives in the same house, indifferent to 670,000 deaths and 9.6 million who've suffered COVID--and may continue to suffer its aftereffects--because he personally has remained untouched.

There are hardly words for such callousness. And then to add, ""Hey, maybe I'd care if 6.7 million had died"" is truly monstrous.

Ross plays these little games in his vacuum-sealed bubble while Idaho institutes quasi-death panels because its ICU units are overflowing like a breached dam. But hey, those are a bunch of rubes in a far-off state, not sophisticated, casuistry-practiced New Yorkers like me and my friends."
2021-09-19 15:03:40,"It seems that Ross is not looking at how the Delta variant is affecting children. 25 percent of new cases are in children. And some are ending up on ventilators and dying.  There was one case in Texas of a 6 year old girl who died. Her whole family was unvaccinated and they all got sick with Covid. Unfortunately, the little girl died.  I think that many younger people have no idea of all of the diseases that our grandparents and older parents had to deal with before vaccines were available.  Nobody knows how sick they will get if they catch Covid. It’s like playing Russian roulette. You could get a sniffle, or you could end up 6 feet under.  The next mutation may be more deadly."
2021-09-19 15:03:50,"If it were 10X as deadly then Trump would be 10X more likely to die from it. So there's that...

But the argument that there would still be a polarized reaction to it, even if it were deadlier? Yeah. Sadly, that's probably true. We're in a sharply polarized democracy. That's how things are now. Honestly, we can't respond to much at all anymore. No wonder the authoritarian model is so attractive, both domestically and worldwide. 

Ideals are great, but functionality is pretty appealing, too.

A lot of people will simply take an ugly car that drives well over a beautiful car that drives badly. What we need is a nice looking car that drives well enough to do the job."
2021-09-19 15:04:09,"It is difficult to see anyone use the outcome of the pandemic to justify political conclusions. It is undeniably true that the world, not just America, despite the awful toll, largely escaped a far worse scenario with a more potent disease. But it is sickening to see this scenario used as an equivocation - the ""political counterfactuals"" listed off in the first paragraph are nothing more then this. So is the justification for the ""libertarian"" positions that we see from the right. And the concept of a ""scissor"" to endorse those who feel 1 in 500 somehow isn't a serious enough crisis (deepest sympathies for Mr..Douthat's family's loss, and all others.) Mr. Douthat may feel    the need to validate right wing dream scenarios, but how does this justify what is actually happening? Does he really feel that trying to make these equivalencies is  a way to address the scarier worse-case scenario we were lucky to avoid?

I know this is beyond the scope of the political context of the article. And to be honest I cannot fathom what would have happened in the US if this virus was more potent. Or what Trump would have done. But surely the more fundamental question must be what should be fine better if the next disease is worse. Or is everyone OK that even under Biden America still isn't doing the right thing to get vaccines out to the poorer world?"
2021-09-19 15:06:22,"During an early press conference I heard Trump say “could be as many as 120,000 but we don’t think it’ll go that far.” That still wasn’t enough to bridge any divide. Now we’re at 670,000. The right wing has dug in, misinformation is as rampant as the virus, ICUs are full, we’re just twiddling our thumbs waiting for the next - more dangerous- variant to pop up, and  you’re saying closing the schools was a mistake while daydreaming about a pandemic 20 years from now. Wow. Just wow."
2021-09-19 15:08:01,"Ross, as usual, is living in an odd place.  Closing schools was the right call. If the virus caused 10 times more deaths it would definitely have gotten people’s attention and avoided politics. Hospitals would have been completely overwhelmed and we would have had scenes ala Monte Python - “Bring out your dead”.  There would have been no question about masking, social distancing.  Food chains and other product distribution would have been impacted.  In some ways, we have gotten off too easy with this pandemic,  we won’t be ready for the next one."
2021-09-19 15:09:30,""" ...especially about closing schools — were made in an atmosphere of panic."" 

   Not really. When the original and arbitrary social distancing guideline of 6 feet came out, most schools realized that they could neither provide nor maintain this in a classroom. 

   The panic reflex in parents is normal, especially when our so-called leaders were continually vacillating or spouting nonsense."

We begged him too. He refused. If he had done it, we would have cheered.

Now, from the Too Little, Too Late Department, he tells his cult to get vaccinated and they boo him. The vile genie is out of the vial."
2021-09-18 22:28:20,"Most of us know over 500 people, just not that well. One thing to keep in mind is that COVID cases aren’t distributed evenly. If you’re a “coastal elite,” as Douthat is, you’re much less likely to know of someone who died than if you live in, say, South Dakota.

Conversely, if you live in a COVID hotspot like South Dakota, you’re likely to know of multiple people who died. South Dakota is approaching something like 1 in 200 deaths. When this started, I assumed this would be the number that caused mass trauma and grief, but apparently not.

When this is over, we will have hit the death rate of the Spanish Flu. With one hundred years of modern medicine and a life saving vaccine. What a pathetic, stupid waste.

I know my heart should be bigger than this, but I hate Red America. I didn’t hate them during Trump. I wanted to defeat them electorally, but I wasn’t ready to write off 40% of the country. But at this point, they seem open to writing off themselves, and I don’t appreciate their efforts to take the rest of us down with them. 

Now I just want them to infect each other as fast as possible so we can put this past us."
2021-09-19 15:18:45,"I think of the pandemic as a real life science experiment from a sociology standpoint that we don't talk about enough, meaning, what is the acceptable covid -19 death rate that we are willing to all mutually agree upon so that we can live with each other?  Because, the current death rate of Covid-19 has certainly divided us to the point that we are having a very difficult time living with each other.

Chris Hayes is saying a death rate tens times higher is still not a big enough number to unite us to the point of forgetting about politics.  I agree.  But, I wonder if there is a number high enough that would pull the few of us still left alive together, or does politics always win until there is just one American alive?  Is there any level of mass carnage that would make politics seem frivolous?"
2021-09-19 15:19:40,"I resist this Republican (those like Douthat that still cling to the label like it means what it once meant) meme that had Former Guy been pro mask, pro action, etc on Covid that Dems and the Left would have tacked opposite. I deny that idea, purely because the Dems and Left are not all-in behind one and only one Cult Leader. 

Repubs seem perfectly comfortable with that personal choice. That the whole 2020 GOP platform was; ""Whatever he says, that's us!"" - compared to the diverse, often overlapping positive ideas and progressive ideologies of the Dems. 

Its always easy to see how Dems are like cats, and are herd resistant, but could seriously use a little of it in off election years. While the Repubs, are the docile sheep now worried about the mangy dog who swiftly and easily herded them into a corner. Cowed by the mangy dog who will not protect them, will bite them, and does toss them aside like old ratty chew toys. 

Had Former Guy done the right things...had his people been truly brave and possessed real intelligence...many more people would have survived, local economies might not be in so much flux, schools might have been open sooner, and many of us would be giving him credit for confounding our expectations...and being slightly more worthy of the honor of the office. 

Yet he did not. He played himself in real life. Like he always does. Same script, same lines. 

BUT even if he had, we would still need to be concerned that he was going to upend our Republic."
2021-09-19 15:25:14,"We may be one measly mutation away from a COVID variant that IS ten times deadlier than what we have now (and as contagious as the Delta Variant). For example, SARS was a coronavirus and it was about 10 times deadlier than COVID, although far less contagious. 
If this happens, and we have vaccines that work against the new mutation, then the cries of ""freedumb from the vaccine"" will nearly vanish and most of the current vaccine refusers will be trampling each other--and anyone else who gets in the way--to get in line for the vaccine."
2021-09-19 15:25:48,"A more interesting question is what our response would have been if the the distribution of mortality had been the same but inverted with respect to age; that is, if children and young adults, rather than pensioners, had formed the most vulnerable population.  Initially, at least, opposition to public health measures was rooted in concerns over the injury they might do to the economy.  Since pensioners contribute nothing to gross national product, and subsist on public expense, Republicans felt perfectly comfortable ignoring their plight.  Indeed, I suspect many welcomed the coming retrenchment.  Who better than God to slash the red side of the ledger? 

Of course, this early rhetoric quickly gave way to paranoid denunciations of liberal ""tyranny,"" as it always does.  I can't help wondering, though, if these same ""principles"" could have withstood a similar onslaught from a more diminutive foe.  

Per usual, Ross can't stop himself from trying to provoke his liberal readership with yet more false equivalency.  But whatever.  He wasn't asking a very interesting question to begin with."
2021-09-19 15:26:27,If most of the world is unvaccinated COVID will continue to spread and mutate. Eventually a more deadly version impervious to the present vaccines may emerge. Large scale vaccination is essential In order to prevent another deadly pandemic. Just as important is for the firms producing vaccines to stay on top of the mutations in order to develop new vaccines rapidly and keep COVID down to the level of a nasty recurring flu that infects fewer people than the standard flu does each year.
2021-09-19 15:30:27,"There is that Trump Cult/Republican projection again. No, liberals would not have rejected a reasoned, scientific approach if it came from Trump. Liberals are not hate filled, adversarial tribalists. We actually want what is best for our country and humanity no matter who proposes it. There is not a mentality of ""owning the conservatives"" equivalent to the cult's desire to ""own the libs"". We are adults and we just don't think like that, Mr. Douthat. It would be lovely if the other part of the country would grow the heck up so we could all work together for the greater good."
2021-09-19 15:30:57,"As someone who is fully vaccinated and caught a ""mild"" breakthrough case, I can say that ""mild"" is in the eye of the beholder.

I no longer sleep 20 hours a day or pass out while walking to the bathroom and I am due to return to work tomorrow, but I am not ""normal"". Everything seems to take twice as long and be twice as hard. And I am ""lucky"". I have friends who still won't get vaccinated even after their spouses died from covid."
2021-09-19 15:31:58,"“…whether there’s a world where Donald Trump went all-in for strict disease-fighting measures and liberals turned anti-lockdown in response…”

Without meaning to, Mr. Douthat provides a fascinating glimpse into the conservative mind by revealing his absurd assumption that both camps believe political fealty trumps rational decisionmaking –  that those of us on the left would behave similarly to those on the right by permitting political allegiance to affect our stance on important medical decisions. And it shows a shocking naïveté about the progressive mindset.

This right-wing worldview  – hewing to an ideological framework despite evidence contrary to fact – is the polar opposite of a progressive worldview, which typically encourages a change in perspective on the basis of new information.  

The notion that those of us in the center and left would disregard medical advice simply because Trump championed it is ludicrous on its face.  Since March of 2020, my progressive friends and I have been lamenting the lack of leadership from the President… fervently wishing that he would rally the country to act together to stem the spread of Covid.  Instead, he chose to divide us by using Covid."
2021-09-19 15:33:43,"""And as terrible as it is that one in 500 Americans have died of Covid, it’s still much easier to have gone through the pandemic without having a close friend or family member die of it — as I have not, for instance — than it would be were the toll one in 50.""

Sorry, this just points to the lack of empathy and moral imagination that afflicts the modern US--especially among those on the Right but not exclusive to them. One shouldn't have to directly experience pain and loss to realize the scope of a threat to one's fellow citizens and humankind and do something about it. Like the simple act of wearing a mask in public to agree to get a safe vaccine."
2021-09-19 15:33:47,"The current average mortality rate from Avian flu (caught directly from chickens and not yet spreading among humans) is 57%, and is unresponsive to antiviral medications. Covid mortality is about 0.3-0.4%. Many epidemiologists believe an avian flu pandemic is a “when” not an “if.” So change your “10” to 50 or 100 times as deadly.

As a former public health officer, the issue for me is not the politics or cult-like anti-science. It’s about our government preparing for what is a likely scenario at some point in the future. Which means PPE, continual development of mRNA vaccines against the current versions of avian flu (which is being done but on a limited basis), but perhaps most importantly, having a plan for what happens if the nation/world does actually shut down. What workers will risk a 50% mortality from a novel virus that could infect 1/3 of the world? Who will grow food, deliver it, keep water supplies going, etc, etc. 

A severe pandemic like this could truly be existential for modern societies. Just as climate change is. So the question that remains—will we fix our governance or suffer the likely consequences."
2021-09-19 15:35:00,"Seeing is believing.  Those who see people that they know are afflicted with the COVID-19 and some perish become cautious and even scared.  They are more likely to seek protection and get vaccinated.  On the other hand, those who do not experience hospitalization and COVID-related death among  family members, friends, and acceptances turn skeptical about masking,  physical distancing, and vaccination. They may consider the whole thing as a hoax and disregard statistics altogether."
2021-09-19 15:16:32,"Ross, you're lucky no one close to you has died from COVID. I am not as lucky. Also, someone very close to me needs cancer surgery next month. I fear he will be at risk of lower care or even postponement due to overflowing hospitals, not to mention exposure to the virus.

Mehh...could have been worse (readers of Ross will likely remember that exact column). 600K+ dead? Mehhh...could have been worse.

Schools were closed based on science, not panic. During the ensuing 15 months, the scientific data available demonstrated that children were at little risk, so this school year, schools are mostly open. There has been little panic among mostly reasoned decision making -- in blue districts.

A more compelling question than your fantasy counterfacutal would be this: You're a conservative columnist; why aren't you spending your 'ink' writing to your people and helping assuage their fears of the Trump Covid vaccines? Any time and energy you spend elsewhere is time wasted, more time allowing Republicans to kill themselves."
2021-09-19 15:37:44,"When it comes to Republican politics, It does not matter whether something is 10 times more deadly, or not.  What matters is if it can be turned in to another divisive issue.
For the past 50 years, some of the richest and most powerful people in America have been funding political division.  They  created media outlets and think tanks, and tasked them to invent and exploit any issues that will divide the middle class. 
  Because a united middle class is the only force that can diminish their political power and control of the government.
  For an example, imagine what the top corporate and individual tax rates would be if arguments about virus ""freedom,"" abortion, religion, guns, etc.,  were reasonably settled and America's middle class vote was not riven by the so-called social issues that  serve to divide neighbors. 
   It is only that division that enables a tiny political minority the political power to maintain the absurdity that money equals speech and corporations are people.

2021-09-19 14:43:14,"Most people don't believe something is happening until it happens to them directly. So, yes, if the numbers were higher, there is a stronger likelihood that more people across populations would not be able to look away from the reality of the pandemic. 

But you're forgetting what motivates someone toward conservatism and what feeds the current conservative base vs. what causes someone to lean toward liberalism and what feeds the current democratic base. Democrats tend to see problems and do their best to create systems that lead large groups of people out of bad situations. Those systems aren't always effective, but at the very least, Democrats acknowledge systemic problems that government is uniquely designed to address.  

Conservatives hate government. They believe in the Ayn Rand mindset, routinely deny that problems exist, and decide that sticking their heads in the sand is better because it's a dog-eat-dog world anyway and the way out is to abandon rules and systems in favor of making money because it's a zero-sum game so whoever has the biggest house wins. (Prove me wrong.) Consequently, conservatives see getting sick as a moral failing, and I've heard talk in conservative media that people who died had pre-existing conditions anyway. So, their fault they go the virus. Sorry charlie! It's a very ""she dressed scantily so obviously she was raped"" sort of mindset.

How about, take COVID as it is right now, but what if a 7 year old upper middle-class white girl had the same chance of death as an 80 year old black male, who had lived a life of poverty?

Anyway... we live in a country in which one of the two political parties is now effectively a death cult and openly encourages white supremacy, so I'm not sure what you are expecting at this point.

In my family (that I know of), we only have one COVID death so far, and we are mostly white and Asian.   If we were black and brown, our numbers would likely be far worse.

I said that if COVID was an order or two of magnitude more virulent, there would not be a Republican Party to contest the 2022 elections.  This remains true.

The Constitution gives one state with less than 2% the population of the biggest the same number of Senators.

Trump can ban Moslems from entering the U.S. (well, only citizens of certain Moslem-Majority countries, including their persecuted Christian minorities).

How absurd is it that Vermont cannot ban citizens of Tennessee from entering their state?  At least unless they have a vax certificate.

Small oversight in your article. We aren’t at only 670,000 deaths because of vaccines.  We’re at that number only because of the sincere efforts to invoke social distancing, mask wearing, and yes the dreaded lockdowns. How many deaths would there be without those efforts- especially in the many months before vaccines? 
Any idea??  Here’s your first hint: it’s in the millions.  Here’s the supportive data: look at other countries around the world. You’ll find all the “counterfactualls” you need. 
Last hint: if you need a reliable source, try reading The Economist."

His cold  projections about the divisive political fallout of 10 times that number are highly offensive to those of us who have lost someone to this pandemic.

But COVID has become a proxy for issues unrelated to disease prevention. People who listen avidly to Fox personalities because of their messaging on hot-button issues from BLM to same-sex marriage are still tuned in when they spread misinformation about medical matters. Mask and vaccine mandates become politicized. 

A substantial part of that audience is already science-skeptical because of fundamentalist ideas about the age of the Earth and evolution. 

When a more lethal epidemic strikes, a failure by millions to make rational decisions about whom to trust could be truly catastrophic. It could lead to the total collapse of society by delaying an effective response while supply chains broke down and the medical system was totally overrun. 

When the plague struck Europe in the 14th century, most people were farmers and each little village could be more or less self-sufficient. That created a basis for survival that we don't have anymore. We are far more advanced technically than our ancestors, but also far more interdependent and perhaps a lot less resilient. 

We are all amateurs about nearly everything.  The most important skill we can have is the ability to make good decisions about whom to trust for advice. ""The guy who tells me what I want to hear,"" isn't the gold standard."

He is understating deaths from Covid by focussing only on the arbitrary national borders. There have been 4.55 million deaths from Covid. It is absurd to cherry pick this. HIs dismissal of Long Covid by saying the US is good at dealing with chronic illness is equally absurd. The epidemiologists are not clairvoyant. Of course some of them got and continue to get things wrong. However, for the very most part they have gotten things right. The decision to keep schoolchildren home to prevent further spread of a virus that we did not have a vaccine (and therefore a solution to) was not made out of panic. It was an available option."

Did the “science” change in August 2021?  Were they wrong before?  Who knows?  My guess is it didn’t adhere to the party line on masks, and presto!  The “science” changed.

 In other words, 40% of Americans will not believe anything they are told, by the other 60%. Especially when it comes to science, and fact.

No, If Trump had advocated strict disease fighting measures, liberals would not have ""turned anti-lock down in response"".  The facts determined the response of the vast majority of Americans.

Yes, some Americans have been fooled by Trump and his minions into an ""in-group loyalty"" response by opposing vaccinations and masking.  We are all paying a terrible price in death and sickness for right wing nut jobs to foment confusion and distrust.  

Alas, the hard realty of facts will, in the end, prove the truth, we must all get vaccinated sooner rather than later to stop the death and sickness.  ""In-group loyalty"" should play no role in the face of the stark realty of death."
2021-09-19 16:13:52,"We didn't close schools for the benefit of the children, we did so for the health and safety of the parents and grandparents.

Schools were (and are) a perfect vector to spread viruses around (as anyone with young children can tell you). Open schools would have defeated any other social distancing and closure measures. Prior to the vaccine, this would have resulted in far more cases and deaths last year. Now, it's mainly a risk for the children themselves and the anti-vax parents."
2021-09-19 16:14:10,"I suspect we will get to those numbers come 2022. I am waiting for Covid to mutate into a truly horrific version where no one will be safe, even the vaccinated. The hubris of man will be our downfall."
2021-09-19 16:15:14,I’m afraid Chris Hayes is right although I naively would not like to think so.
2021-09-19 11:43:08,"Not all “public health authorities got it wrong”, Ross.  Why only cite Hoover Institution and Stanford?   Projections below were readily available in early and mid-2020 but some chose to ignore them.

3/20/20 - CDC via NY Times:  “according to a projection that encompasses the range of the four scenarios…As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die.”

8/6/20:  “By Dec. 1, the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 could reach nearly 300,000” (IHME)

9/4/20:  The U.S. will top more than 410,000 Covid-19 deaths by the end of the year as the country heads into the fall and winter, according to a new forecast from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME)."
2021-09-19 03:10:21,"Here is some perspective on thinking about, ""What if Covid mortality had been 10 times higher?"" and ""What if Covid mortality had been only 1/10th as high?"" If this same article had been published just two months ago, July 18, we would be looking ahead to 10 percent more deaths, as of today. We would also be looking at projections for 20 to almost 50 percent more deaths, after July 18, by the end of this year. The toll doesn't end on December 31, either. It's conceivable the country could end up with over one million Covid deaths by 2022 - and that's not even factoring whether another powerful variant develops.

The two words ""one million"" are chilling to me. It's not a percentage but a hard number. If the thought of one million deaths doesn't stop people in their tracks - probably about half of these losses preventable if the right wing weren't so noisily churning out anti-vaxx nonsense - then I don't know what's left to say. If that prospect, a distinct possibility, doesn't shock holdouts into getting vaccinated, nothing will. The tabulations in the link are suggestive.

2021-09-19 15:30:01,This is Mr. Douhat's the most informative article to date. Not because of his usual odd brand of speculation but because in paragraph two he inadvertently describes his thought process. It's like a realtor opened his brain for a public showing and we're invited to look in all the closets. I practically have to be asleep and dreaming to conjure fantasies this rich. Yet he does it fully awake. Marvelous.

It’s not, it’s actually quite benign for the vast majority."
2021-09-19 15:03:14,"I read Douthat to attempt to understand viewpoints far from my own, even though he doesn’t make it easy. 

Today, he throws out a few quotes from conservatives at the start of the pandemic, expressing wrong-headed corporate/right wing-interests-disguised-as-magical-thinking. The stuff that appeals to Covid deniers then and now. 

That doesn’t mean that the rest of us bought it back then. So when the virus did what it is here to do, killed far more people than Mike Pence expected, this somehow retroactively validates Chris Hayes’ observation? 

Since many if not most of us didn’t believe Pence et al then, that kinda blows your little thought experiment. This exercise in sophistry was a 1/2 cup of coffee’s waste of my reading time."
2021-09-19 16:16:37,"Pandemic responses must take place at the national level. Examples include Trump's development of multiple vaccines and Biden's quick vaccine rollout. Most everything else has been left to states and localities, producing a mess of hot zones.

Prior to Biden's recent OSHA announcement and other edicts, most of the pandemic response has been fractured, either at the state level or even within states (see, for instance, DeSantis' ridiculous attempts to squash local school-board masking policies). 

Viruses don't stop at county or state borders, and until we mandate science-based pandemic responses, they won't stop at the national level, either."
2021-09-19 16:11:01,"I got the vaccine...to protect myself. I had Covid last year. Not fun, or funny. I was lucky. 

I also get my car/s inspected each year, another gov't mandate, that costs me money. I dont like it, its always a hassle, but having functioning breaks and a functioning exhaust, etc, is good for me, and those around me. My properly working breaks, means I wont crash into anyone under normal conditions. Stops me from rear-ending all the school buses in my way on my home from work. 

My freedom is not cramped because of these mandated inspections. In fact, due to all of them combined they make my life better. Less pollution and less people driving up on the sidewalks. 

I know I'm not alone with being exhausted by this damn silly argument, that has gone on for far too long. 

Whats more tiresome, and frankly fear laced, is how many people I know, who I once thought sorta reasonable, who have shown little to no reason, or rationality the last year, and 4 prior under Former Guy. The lack of rationality, compounded by the Cult of Personality sycophancy is saddening and maddening, because lives are at risk. Because I no longer trust even those associates I once thought reasonable. 

We should all be worried by how unreasonable so many people have decided is who they are, at all times. Unreasonable. Irrational, and prone to fits of such profound idiocy...I worry they will take us all down, while we attempt to coddle them...a crowd of belligerent fools!"
2021-09-19 16:11:32,"As usual, many of these commenters skipped the actual article and are commenting on the byline. Mr. Douthat ought to consider occasionally using an alternate name in these columns just to see what sort of responses he receives."
2021-09-19 16:17:10,"Mr. Douthat seems to answer his own question, then tries to muddy the waters.  The glaringly obvious conclusion is that 10xCovid would not change the conservative response.  Libertarians and Conservatives, from the outset, argued that there was no amount of death they would not allow if the deterrent would be having to make even the slightest sacrifice themselves to protect human lives.  Even the minor inconvenience of having to wear a mask was unacceptable to the majority of Conservatives and Libertarians.  

For all the moralizing about abortion on the right, it is impossible to take their commitment to the sanctity of human life seriously.  Simply being asked to lift a finger to save thousands of human lives was beyond what the right was willing to do."
2021-09-19 16:28:43,"First, I should say that I’m vaccinated and find the position that anyone might take against vaccination to be irrational.  It was two tiny shots and the odds were astronomically against my developing any negative reaction.  I’ve felt, and often professed to my audience of one (my wife) or two (if you count the dog), that this vehement opposition to the vaccine is politically driven and completely hypocritical, and would disappear if covid symptoms and death rates were more like Ebola.  But to be fair, I’m beginning to wonder if I’m wrong and that vaccine hesitancy is mostly due to the fact that covid really is not that deadly, and that it will have to get a lot worse to push people off the fence.  I’d love to know if the hypocrisy that I think exists would disappear along with all resistance to becoming vaccinated, but I also truly hope that I don’t get to see that scenario play out."
2021-09-19 16:33:35,"So instead of helping you go for more diversion. 

The only correct topic is why did the last administration shut down our dedicated professional response team in April 2017? Then when they were needed refuse to accept the truth from the other professionals relaying the three most terrifying words in any language ""Novel corona virus"" chose without evidence to deny the truth of them?
 
You want to talk theories? Why has it happened that every bad decision by the previous administration has profited the 1% in numbers not seen since the robber barons? 
It would make more sense to raise the topic of whether or not some republican lab created SARSCoV2 for the purpose of profiting off the desperation and death they caused by inaction refusal to act and straight up denial of facts to ensure a small epidemic became a worldwide pandemic."
2021-09-19 16:34:42,"This pandemic has fallen upon us unevenly. There is good aggregate data to help us track its overall impacts. But there is little information about who, specifically, is getting infected or hospitalized or dying. And who isn't.

For instance, I can check the aggregate information and see that at present about 20 persons in my county of 50,000 are being infected every day (or, at that rate, about 15% of us in a year). But what are the circumstances of those infections? And are they similar to my circumstances, or not? Or, put another way, which 15% will be infected?

This prevents us from making a better assessment of our risks. And I think that is at the heart of the different reactions we've had to this pandemic.

Some, on the left mostly, are data driven and see the scary aggregate problem (600,000 dead) and want bold, concerted aggregate action to limit aggregate exposure, actions applicable to everyone.

Others, more likely on the right, look at their own experience, see little effect in their orbit (85% here won't be infected) and little risk or need for ""panic"" and resist what seem like unnecessary restrictions on their lives imposed by others. preferring to make their own decisions. 

This creates fertile ground for those whose vocation or avocation is dividing us politically. I'd love to see everyone vaccinated and wearing a mask at the supermarket, but I can also see why a Brooklynite and a rancher in west Texas might see things differently."
2021-09-19 16:37:07,"I think a more interesting counterfactual is what would have happened had the President recognized the seriousness of the Covid Pandemic and brought together Republican and Democratic leaders to work out a common strategy to fight the pandemic. Would we as a country have accepted mask wearing, some of the restrictions on activities, and ultimately getting vaccinated to a much greater extent than is now the case? I would like to think so, but it is a counterfactual that needs to be explored because it might give us guidance into how to handle future pandemics, or even other crises."
2021-09-19 16:47:25,"Does everyone realize that straight up until March/April 2020, masks were widely studied and shown to not reduce transmission of aerosolized viruses?  That no doctor would ever have agreed they have benefit for the general public who is asymptomatic?  

I feel like I’m living an alternate reality, and I’m embarrassed that so many of my colleagues are willing to suddenly agree that masks really matter, despite years of study and real world evidence."
2021-09-19 16:47:27,"When did the political divide in the United States become such a grim, ruthless life-and-death matter? When do we climb from the trenches, dash across No Man’s Land and embrace our enemies like French and German soldiers did on 11-11-1918?
Isn’t the Covid pandemic sufficiently threatening to shut down our hateful partisan circus for even a day or a week? Aren’t climate change, the possibility of one superpower “striking” another to create a distraction, and endless wars enough reasons to convince us that setting aside our longterm propaganda-laced war of division makes good sense?

The pandemic is unpredictable. No one could see what lay before us in January, 2020. That’s reasonable. But turning our inability to accurately predict the future into political weaponry has just made things worse. So much worse.

The probability of solving a complex problem will never be improved by adding layers of animosity, misinformation, sabotage, corruption and mindlessness to the process. An honest, sincere, collective effort — working together as brothers and sisters — always affords us our best chance of success."
2021-09-19 16:54:31,"""Even with rapidly developed vaccines, we’ve had 670,000 reported coronavirus deaths and counting. This is less death, yes, than some of the absolute worst-case projections""

Mr. Douthat writes as if this is over.

Despite frequent attempts, he has rarely been more wrong.  Winter is coming."
2021-09-19 16:55:46,"I think with 670,000 Americans dead from the virus in less than 2 years, statements like closing schools was a ""bad idea,"" ""most people who get it still come out OK,"" ""America is good at ignoring its chronic illness epidemics,"" and the ""celebrities"" who died from it ""are more obscure"" than Tom Hanks and trump, Douthat does a good job of proving true Hayes' cynical prediction.   It's also likely that a deadly pandemic 10 times worse would have made right-wing politicization and disregard for public safety 10 times uglier."

Also, it's about 1/266 Black people, so Ross Douthat can miss me with his actuarial ghastliness."
2021-09-19 17:01:06,"This is one of the best editorials I've seen on COVID.

I'm a healthy female and mostly surrounded by healthy family and friends, even those who are older and more at risk from COVID.  Nobody I know perceives a real risk from COVID.  Yes, we all know a terrible reaction and ultimately death is a statistical probability, but it a probability akin to dying doing something we do each day, such as using a rideshare service.

I want to add one point:

Here's another area where we are different.  Some people say that there is some way we could have prevented 600k+ people from dying.

I disagree.  A new disease that spreads easily and rapidly through society is going to kill those who are most susceptible regardless of what we do.  

Many will disagree with my statement above.  But let's see what happens over time - I predict every American will experience COVID over time, and the virus will become like other common ailments.

That said, the best way for individuals to protect themselves is vaccination, so if you're at risk, get vaccinated."

Covid, for all its deprivations, is hidden. You get sick like a flu or bad cold, stay at home, then, if you're really sick, you're whisked to a quarantined ICU to (maybe) recover or expire. 

If the next plague was like measles, or smallpox, or the bubonic plague with hideous (instagram-ready) buboes preceding a sordid death, or like polio with children in iron lungs, the ""anti vax"" crowd would be miniscule, and any politician peddling such nonsense would be run out of town."

Maybe do your next column on the perversion of Christianity in America that believes people get sick and have bad luck because they deserve it. 

Good luck defending that lack of empathy, humility and charity. Peace be with you or whatever."

It would have made Jonestown look like a celebration of life by comparison.

That's what get you from the Republican cult of unreason."
2021-09-18 20:04:42,"This is ridiculous and ignores reality.

Ross Douthat's party of science politicizers is advocating that people who do not get COVID vaccines but do get COVID should get monoclonal antibody treatments instead.

And the very same vaccine-deniers in Ross Douthat's party are spending tens of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to get the same kind of ""untested"" treatment shot into their veins as vaccines.

But the cost in American lives and taxpayer dollars is not paid by the privileged like Ross Douthat who write columns to normalize what amounts to mass killing by his own party.

No Ross, the mass killing that your party's science denying has caused would not happen with Democrats. Douthat's normalizing of his own party's death causing policies is reprehensible, but not surprising.

I do wish that Ross Douthat and all defenders of Republicans be denied any medical treatment for anything - except by anti-vaccine and anti-ask doctors - until the pandemic is over.

But instead they always demand to be first in line while others die."
2021-09-19 03:45:11,"He's talking like it  is all over.  1 in 500 today.  What will it be when Covid is a done?  Will it ever be done?  
With deaths in America approaching the worst ever on a daily basis, 1 in 250 is for sure in sight.
And then there is the possible mutation, the one that doesn't recognize the vaccine.  America is probably the most likely place for it to appear.  With many sick with Covid and spreading it to those already vaccinated , since there are almost no measures to slow the spread, all it takes is one mutated little virus that is ok with the vaccines to get into a vaccinated person, and it would be back to square one.  And if that mutation or another one also didn't recognize previous immunity from having gotten Covid, well, then that would be square one.  And whose to say it wouldn't be  more deadly, or as contagious as Delta.

Americans keep writing like Covid is a thing of soon to be the past.  Sorry folks, everytime you say that you have been so wrong."
2021-09-18 21:29:05,"The problem with counterfactuals is that they play into the same problem conservatives currently have. They are counter to the facts.

The only way Ross can tell a story anymore is by telling a story which is not based in fact. Because fact and the lived world has shown his ideology to be spurious at best.

The only thing ross has left in his ideological tank is daydreams where reality is different. Where he gets to put his fingers on all the weights to come up with a different solution.

Not a solution based on facts, but one based on his grotesque dreams.

What conservatives need is not counterfactuals. They have those galore. What they need is a plan to deal with reality as it is.

FDA panel has done a phenomenal job by rejecting Biden's ""Boosters for all vaccinated and COVID survivors"" Recommendation of boosters for 65+ and all those with underlying conditions who wish to receive a booster is in order because there is now a recognition that vaccine immunity wanes in those who were previously considered fully immunized. Yesterday I met a lady who has leukemia and she said her doctor has advised her to get the booster. I support the choice of receiving a booster if for whatever reason a person in consultation with their doctor decides to receive a booster. I would also recommend that all those, 65+/-, who have anxiety as to whether they still have protection from the vaccine get their antibody level against COVID checked. Health insurance companies will cover the cost."

When it became clear that everyone including the children  of MAGA followers were at risk it was too late. Minds have been made up and people haven’t been willing to change position on masks and vaccines until death is literally at their door.  Sadly, they have to personally feel the effects of this tragedy to act like we live in a society."

2021-09-19 17:13:54,"Mike Pence has proven himself incapable of handling truth, so his advice as well as Trump was political.  The reason we continue to battle Covid worldwide is the failure to follow Science.  covid-19 mutated to a more infectious variant because our response was divided.  Those who only trust their leader when they want too.  This constituents would selectively believe Trump and Trump’s spineless response is to lean in to agreeing to Fake cures despite being saved by treatments reserved for the Elite. Since the current Covid is more infectious, more likely ten or more times than before the vaccine, someone you know will likely contract it.  Vaccination status / health conditions determines their fate - death, hospitalization or mild symptoms.    Healthcare is overwhelmed and it’s harder for the caregivers to work continuously on something that could have been preventable.  Science evolves with findings and results.  initial decisions were based on preventing a higher death worldwide.  Now we need to follow basic precautions bec we can deal better.  However, those who profligate hoaxes and conspiracy theories in the web only undermines any progress"
2021-09-19 17:17:58,"We're still failing to discuss politics in geographical context. Most diseases emerge as localized epidemics. As a purely practical matter, diseases can only travel as far as their living hosts will take them. A truly virulent disease is therefore unlikely to become a pandemic. Dead hosts don't typically travel very far. The ""10x-worse/10x-better"" question isn't particularly useful because most diseases aren't emerging in many places at the same time.

So how do politics differ when different US areas are impacted at different times? We can only hint around the edges of this question. Trump's ""blue-state-disease"" quickly fell apart. However, the effort is telling. The post-vaccine death map presents a surprisingly similar example. There's a ""your-own-fault"" attitude that often ignores the 2nd order deaths resulting from victim blaming. A fault which is met with a ""for-your-own-good"" attitude with vaccine mandates.

In all, I'd suggest all politics is local when it comes to disease. The lethality doesn't really matter so much as the spread, or even the route by which it spread. Ahem, ""China flu."" With a pandemic at least, the spread part is already behind everyone. Academics are now free to ponder virulence hypotheticals."
2021-09-19 17:18:16,"Another few counterfactuals to consider: What if Covid-19 was permanently disfiguring and left bad facial scarring? What if it caused patients to gain half their weight over the next six months? What if it had symptoms similar to Ebola (but less lethal) such as diarrhea and severe dehydration? In other words, what does the specific nature of Covid-19 teach us about what people fear most?"

Over time, a new virus is certain. Several, a regular succession of them. Yes, it must be, it always has been, and it must get worse because of population size and travel.

How bad will it be? Some will be worse than others, and one will be the worst.

How long? Well, if we measure in a few years, it won't be that often. If we measure in the life of our nation, it will be very often.

We must govern our nation with an eye to the life of the nation. It is a long term project, not a quarterly dividend."

For example, what if a particular bug killed 99 out of 100 people?  What if the bug killed 70 out of 100?

2021-09-19 17:37:56,"Well, we know our data is pretty poor. If you are in the hospital for any reason and tested positive, you become a hospitalized Covid patient and if you die, you become a Covid death.

But no matter what, it's a disease. Turns out authoritarians can't force fix nature's disease, and lockdowns/school closings/border shutdowns forced global mixing and spread of the disease.  Keeping people indoors and not exercising made it worse. Pretending masks work well made it worse. And now pretending that the unvaccinated are a threat to the vaccinated (does the vaccine not work?) and the vaccinated mean no more spread have all led to the mess of central planner's love of force."
2021-09-19 17:39:53,so because the disease hasn't affected the families of many conservatives they can't see the benefit of public health measures? are you saying conservatives lack the empathy to acknowledge the suffering of others different from themselves?
2021-09-19 17:41:41,"I believe Chris Hayes' postulation to be correct.

The right's reaction to facts is always to double down on their original position, regardless of what those new facts reveal or seem to prove.  They always manage to come up with a rationalization or spin in order to mitigate or disregard something new that is a potential threat to their group cohesiveness.

If more people have to die in order to maintain that ""cohesiveness"", that is simply collateral damage that can't be avoided.

Climate change denial would be a decent but imperfect analogy, since it lacks the immediate threat that a global pandemic does.  

I suspect that they will be denying it up until and even after the state of Florida is completely underwater.

At that point, it will simply be an ""act of god"" that could not have been foreseen."
2021-09-19 17:45:29,I shudder when I hear that Covid is not as consequential because it strikes older populations at a higher rate.  Or those with chronic health concerns.   This virus has shown me how little value these groups have in this society even after years of supporting it.
2021-09-19 17:44:29,"Ross, Ross... Covid doesn't need to be 10 times deadlier. It's already deadly as Hell.
Oh, and the one thing we could count on during Trump: Whatever the right thing was to do - shut down, wear masks, follow science, or even on international relationship issues - we could always count on Trump to do whatever was most insane.

I'm enjoying living in a reality zone again, however brief it might be till the crazies take power and try to kill all of us again with their intentional ignorance."
2021-09-19 17:48:18,"Many years ago, in college, I read a futurist's prediction of how the human species would become extinct. He said not by fire nor by ice but because of virus so deadly and so contagious that it would kill off the population so quickly that counter measures (i.e., effective vaccines) could not be developed). What was missing in the article was the mechanism how this would occur. Now we know. 

A virus gets rolling but effective vaccines are developed. For assorted reasons, a significant percentage of the population refuses to use the vaccine. This not only allows the virus to spread (the epidemic of the unvaccinated) it also provides the incubator and the vector where the virus can mutate and become stronger. As it becomes more deadly, it will start causing even the vaccinated to test positive (the breakthrough). Though few at first and with only mild symptoms, breakthroughs will increase, the virus will strengthen and eventually overpower the protection of the vaccinated. A few will survive by hiding under the rocks with cockroaches, but the human species is doomed. 

I hope the futurist (and I) are wrong, but we seem to be on a glidepath to this end. I also hope the right-wing enjoys these comments. They seem to like to be scared.

2021-09-19 08:48:36,"Covid is a scourge.   It is much worse than influenza.

Chris Hayes is correct.   If Covid were as deadly as the Ebola virus, hemorrhaging entrails and causing the mortifying disgorgement of bodily fluids, prim southerners would line up for the vaccine pronto.

Putting Covid in deadly perspective requires respect for scientific knowledge and thinking.  That is in short supply in the U.S.

Covid is an obligate intracellular parasite.  If you don't get it bad, then you can act as a replicating host to spread it to someone very vulnerable.   Also, when it commandeers the machinery of your cells, there is a good probability of mutations, causing variants.

This is too much for hoi polloi to comprehend.   In addition, the federal government has made few creative attempts to disseminate this information.

Many people say, ""I'm in good shape, I will survive.  The government will not tell me what to do.""  They gainsay their potentiality as a vector of transmission.   Also, they cannot make a distinction between acute symptoms such as fever, chills, difficulty breathing, and bad, chronic, long term effects such as heart problems.

Now the prevailing anti-vax stance is, ""You will not vaccinate me for $20.   I'll take a free federal monoclonal antibody infusion costing $2000.   Nobody is going to disabuse me of my scientific illiteracy or lack of good citizenship.""  

They also invoke the words of Governor DeSantis, who made it okay to be antisocial.

You say ""it's still much easier to have gone through the pandemic without having a close friend or family. member die of it"" but that ""America ""is good at ignoring its chronic illness pandemic.""

I sense that you are struggling.  I see that you are trying to rationalize these deaths and their long-haul impact on our children and friends and square those deaths and sufferings with the political reactions by Florida's DiSantis, and Texas' Abbott.  

Let me help you.  Consider the 17th century England's John Donne's ""No Man is an Island"" poem:

No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent,  part of the main; if a clod by washed away by the sea, Europe is the less . . any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.  And therefore never send to know for who the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.""

That 670,000 Americans have died and by next week 700,000 will die is a tragedy.  So is the death of 50 children or even a child. The long haul covid suffered by thousands of Americans is likewise a tragedy.  I am saddened.  And you, too, as an American ought to be saddened.  As John Donne wrote, ""the bell . . . tolls for thee.""  

To rationalize that 10 times as many deaths might be needed before Governors DiSantis and Abbott alter their foolishness is perplexing.    Harken back to John Donne's words."

GOP Conservatives are illogical and want it both ways. Afghanistan's government and army collapsed overnight and they looked for someone else to blame. The blame squarely rests with them.They went to war in afghanstan on the mere suspicion that osama had masterminded 9/11. They had no evidence. The only evidence to this day is a tape in his haven in Afghanistan that could have been cleverly doctored by US intelligence, theoretically. There are other possibilities.Osama did it but there was no clear evidence,but a reasonable suspicion, and the CIA planted the tape. It could be that the tape was real after all, though nobody other than Nixon taped his own crimes.
Then the GOP conservatives tried to build a nation in Afghanistan.They invaded iraq, manufacturing evidence, planted by their GOP intelligence chief for them.Then Trump signed a surrender notice in qatar and pulled out all but 2500 troops who faced imminent attack from the Taliban.They would have been attacked if the US did not leave."

2021-09-19 08:57:55,"Has Ross ever taken a college statistics class? Has he ever taken college level general biology? From his error-riddled piece, I’d say no. 

Ross, if SARS-CoV-2 were ten times deadlier, panic would override politics. If you bothered to consult the COVID resource pages on the Johns Hopkins or Harvard websites, the science is explained by the two best medical schools in the country. Nature, The New England Journal of Medicine, and Lancet have been updating the science almost daily. If you’d been keeping up on things, and you took college stats and bio, you’d understand what a zoonotic spillover is, why high transmissibility is the problem, and why the science changes as more is known about a novel virus and its mutations. 

Lethality isn’t as important as transmissibility. The Marburg virus kills nearly every human who comes into contact with it. But it’s not transmissible between people; Marburg lives in bat guano and people who inadvertently put bare hands on infection guano end up dead within a few days. But SARS-CoV-2 is lethal BECAUSE of its transmissibility; and high transmissibility means more death. David Quammen referred to such a virus in the jet age as an “angel of death.” 

You can argue theology all you want. But you don’t get to argue science if you can’t understand it. Think of the virus like Vikings vs. the Templars. The latter were deadlier but only to those who challenged them. Vikings spread farther and killed indiscriminately."

How many mutations are needed to make our current virus far more lethal than it is now?  No one knows.  But mutation rates scale with virus prevalence.  This virus dwarves the others for prevalence.

Both spent some time in the hospital. One was older—a friend’s father. A man with a long history and lots of love left. Another, the husband of a friend. Interestingly, they both died. Horrifying deaths. From COVID. You see, they could not get enough oxygen. I’ve been extremely ill before. I’ve injured myself, particularly with brain injuries (not purposefully!) that I wish had never occurred. I count myself lucky, though.

There is a precedent for another disease in modern times which has been classified as either an epidemic or pandemic. This illness killed more slowly, but affected all age groups (multiple modes of transmission). At the outset of the HIV epidemic, before effective drug therapy the mortality rate was much higher. Who politicized HIV Ross?  Why no mention of HIV in your column.  It took C. Everett Koop who was appointed by Reagan to defy the expectations of the the right wing base and demonstrate his credibility as a public health official who cared for people. Kind of cherry picking your epidemics/pandemics to fit your political views Ross!"
2021-09-19 15:25:47,"Every Douthat column I am foolish enough to waste time on leaves me struggling to decipher
the point he is trying to make. This column is no exception. I think, but I’m not positive, that his
take on covid is that it’s not really that bad
since most people don’t die, and he doesn’t know anyone who has. Conservatives in general seem to be compassionate and generous towards members of their own family and extended clan but were never taught much concern for the greater good. Civic duty, empathy for the less fortunate, personal responsibility have all devolved into slogans 
at best. This morally reprehensible stance 
has revealed itself in deadly fashion in a
maniacal fury at the notion of being “forced” to wear a mask or get vaccinated. These rugged individualis with their sick notion of freedom(s)
have blood on their hands and they couldn’t  care less."
2021-09-19 03:19:15,"As long as we’re discussing counterfactuals…

What if China actually upheld its legal obligation under WHO International Health Regulations [IHRs] Articles 6 and 7 requiring timely, accurate, detailed public notifications in the event of a public health emergency?

Perhaps over 663,000 Americans would not have died, millions would not be injured and trillions of dollars would not be lost.

Instead, the Chinese knowingly breached this agreement, allowing the outbreak to rapidly spread outside Wuhan, its place of origin. Moreover, the Chinese arrested and intimidated the Wuhan doctors who were trying to warn the public of the emerging disease - Same playbook they used for SARs in 2002."
2021-09-19 17:15:56,I don't think it would make an ounce of difference.  This that do not want the shots  simply do not want them.  They have a bunch of unsubstantiated reasons for that and those reasons are enough to keep them from getting shots.
2021-09-19 17:33:15,"can someone tell me what logical fallacy he is making when he talks about only obscure right wing celebrities dying and not any prominent celebrities? not sure what he is trying to prove by highlighting this.  perhaps most big name celebrities were intelligent enough to get vacinated  and take precautions, while the right wing radio hosts decided to be libertarian matters and make poor health choices by not getting vaccinated, as well as nudging their followers to make bad health care decisions as well. I would have thought someone who regular writes for the NYT would have been intelligent enough to realise that he  is probably not making a very good case for his argument by highlighting this observation of his. My local hospital network has a graphic of all the people currently in intensive care, and on ventilators, and color coats the patient's as vaccinated and unvaccinated. It should be a wake up call to anyone who thinks not getting vacinatednis a good choice. check out prism health sc homepage. please protect yourself while you have the chance. we are so lucky to have the technology and materials to produce highly effective safe vaccines for our entire populace (US that is).  i have a family friend that was adamantly antivaccine. this unfortunate individual caught covid.  2 days later his only grandchild was born.  he had to be admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress,  was put on a ventilator and died within about a week having never met his grandchild."
2021-09-19 18:01:58,We actually had a disease example that was quite enlightening. During the Ebola outbreak in Africa it was right wing politicians who wanted to take the most drastic measures. They wanted to deny entry to the U.S. to anyone from Africa even if they came from an area thousands of mikes from the Ebola hot spot. One woman was forced to quarantine by none other than Chris Christy’s administration in New Jersey even though medical experts said it was not necessary. What we learned was that right wing politicians will enthusiastically trample individual rights if they think it helps make a political point. We also  learned that travelers from anywhere in Africa could be considered to be a danger to public health.
2021-09-19 17:27:07,"What is missing from Mr. Douthat's column are NAMES--names of people who have died from the virus.  Here is one: My grandmother, Cecilia Jochimsen, died of the Spanish Flu in early 1919 in the second wave of the virus.  Born in 1879 she had to wait until she was 21 in the year 1900 to come to America.  She married a Croatian immigrant and had five children.  Her American dream lasted 19 years.   

Every opinion piece, every science report, every counterfactual fantasy about the virus should include at least one name of a victim."
2021-09-19 17:47:06,"“A world where Donald Trump went all-in for strict disease-fighting measures and liberals turned anti-lockdown in response, or one where Trump won re-election and hesitation over the “Trump vaccine” ended up stronger on the left.”
We had that! The first lockdowns were under Trump. The vaccine was develop under Trump, and most liberal minded people did not rebel against those things based on who signed the paperwork. We followed the science as it developed. 
Ross just can’t avoid inventing fantasies that liberal decisions are based on contrarianism instead of the best information available.  If conservatives started saying the sky is yellow, liberals wouldn’t be saying it’s blue just to be disagreeable. Ross assigns his own motivation to others, because it’s the only motivation he can imagine."
2021-09-19 17:45:19,"Ross says that ""as bad as the coronavirus has been, most people who get it still come out OK, children are especially unlikely to be hospitalized or die, and deaths are concentrated in a population, the elderly in nursing homes, that (to our shame) we already keep somewhat out of mind."" These observations are out of date. Most people are ""ok,"" except for the 670,00 who have died and an unknown number with long Covid or permanent disabling effects. How many children would have to hospitalized and how many would have to die before Ross thinks it warrants his attention?  The last point about the elderly is nauseating. Perhaps to Ross, but they are not ""somewhat out of mind"" either to their families or much of the public.

Why this head-in-the-sand, uncaring attitude? Because Ross is and always has been a Republican, and he sounds like one."
2021-09-18 20:49:27,"What is clear from the evidence (much as Ross detests evidence) is that his party, with its Dear Leader and lockstep fanatics, is directly responsible for the pathetic response to COVID in 2020, and is directly responsible for the deaths, long-haul cases, and current surge largely boosted by anti-vaxx and anti-mask fanatics (most of who still believe in the steal).  But no matter how many people die or are disabled, it's worth eliminating both abortion and birth control for Ross' personal deity, who--he insists--must be obeyed by believer and nonbeliever alike."
2021-09-19 17:26:27,The real question isn't what people would do on their own. The real question is would a network like fox news still cater to the antivax crowd with a disease having a 30-40 percent fatality rate. Do they have any moral or ethical compass whatsoever.
2021-09-19 15:36:57,"I pose a somewhat different thought exercise (with due credit to A.G. Wells): What if we were invaded by aliens from a far away galaxy and the only way to thwart their attack was to be inoculated with an “anti-alien” vaccine? No doubt every government in the world including ours would mandate it and people would be rioting to get it lest they succumb to the aliens that eat brains. So why is this corona virus, something scientist can barely classify as “living”, not seen the same way. It’s an invader here to eat our brains, hearts and souls away."
2021-09-19 15:15:06,"No Ross, kids are infected too, and increasingly die from covid, mostly in unvaccinated conservative families. 

Are conservative families fit to raise children?"
2021-09-18 20:54:54,"Ross, as usual you give your conservative friends too much credit. The reason a 10x or 100x or 1000x pandemic would not have changed the societal outcome is that for many (?most) Republicans, FACTS DON’T MATTER. full stop. This is evidenced by completely delusional, fact free thinking and speech on the right regarding the true COVID death rate, the safety of vaccines, the utility/futility of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, the “plandemic” and so forth. I don’t understand how this happened so rapidly to a major political party in the US, maybe that’s something worth speculating on."
2021-09-19 11:41:15,"First, Trump and his party said the virus would not harm Americans; the Chinese created it. Later, they said it was a hoax. Then they suggested fake remedies. Fast forward to today, where they are fighting mandates to mask or vaccinate, which in the end appears to be killing more Republicans than Democrats. Yes, lives have been lost and there are miles yet to travel, to say nothing about the trillions of dollars the unvaccinated are costing our Treasury.  What an amoral political party with which Ross Douthat is affiliated."
2021-09-19 05:18:14,"If Covid were 10 times deadlier things would be completely different. The hospitals are full now and last winter hospitals rented refrigerated trucks to hold the dead bodies. The news shows would feature funeral businesses not able to handle all of the new business. You would have riots, you would have hysteria. The intellectuals can drink tea and say it wouldn't be that different. It would be very different."
2021-09-19 13:34:20,"Children may be less likely to develop a severe case or die from COVID, but they are suffering, and they are dying, in FL and elsewhere, and Republicans seem fine with that."
2021-09-19 16:08:52,"Would it be different if the virus were 10 times more deadly?  I wonder.  Look how incredibly deadly it has already been:

In one-and-a-half years Covid-19 has killed considerably more Americans that died in all our wars since 1900.

World War I
World War II
The Korean War
The Vietnam War
The Balkan War
The Gulf War
The Iraq War
The 20 year war in Afghanistan
The 21 times we invaded Caribbean and Latin American countries  during the 20th century.

As things are going right now, for every person killed each day in auto accidents about 18 people die from Covid.  Where is MADD when we need them?

I have raised my estimate of the coefficient of stupidity for America from 0.33 to 0.40 - and that is beginning to look optimistic.

2021-09-19 14:30:38,"Thanks to those gain of function researchers, we may very well have a 60% deadly contagion released from a lab. That is pretty much game over for modern society. As for our reaction, isn't it obvious? We are doomed. Those mistakenly identified as geniuses have created communication and information systems that are destroying truth and our society for profit. The truly intelligent among us are incapable of countering the ignorant goons who, much as in the childhood playground, continue to intimidate and dominate us."

Covid has far exceeded expectations. Early on, many on right, following Trump, were calling it a hoax. That sort of talk led to the deaths of thousands, as the Trump admin did nothing early on to contain it. This paper published a huge headline when the US reached 100,000 deaths, but right-wingers only made things more political by stupidly opposing masks and vaccinations, neither of which is any more inconvenient or harmful than wearing a seatbelt---which has saved millions of lives over the years. It, too, received ignorant opposition when first legislated."
2021-09-19 03:05:00,"What I fail to understand is why people who don’t want to take the vaccine because it is “new” seemingly have no problem taking even newer and more experimental drugs like monoclonal antibodies?  I guess if Trump & Fox pundits attacked them, they’d be resisted as well… So it’s more about who to believe?  if so, 10x wouldn’t matter.  People would be told not to trust the numbers, AND that doctors withheld treatment, and it’s their fault. And it’s a conspiracy.

What a mess. We need to fix this insanity or we are doomed."
2021-09-19 01:42:50,"The issues brought up in this opinion piece are just the tip of the political polarization iceberg. 
The far right- with nonstop encouragement by the likes of Fox News- tosses out partisan poison like water. On the other hand, the far left with its identity politics on steroids- and stupidity like “defund the police” -is totally unhelpful. 

Most of America is in some part of the middle. The nation is a moderate, centrist one at its core but the continued left/ right war will destroy us if we don’t get a grip. For starters, so- called progressives need to let Biden do his thing as a moderate without holding him hostage to far left policies. If this doesn’t happen we will likely see  control of Congress change hands in 2022. And Trump or one of his clones winning the presidency in 2024 is not out of the question."
2021-09-18 20:31:51,"If the disease had in fact been a bioweapon made by let’s say ISIS, do you think the response would have been much different?  Would you have had pundits on Fox pushing American flag masks.  Pastors would be telling their flock to mask up for Jesus.  Would we have closed our borders immediately and shut down hard?  At the onset, I expected a Patriot Act type response, and to my surprise we didn’t see it."
2021-09-19 17:47:34,"The rights response is religious in nature and nothing is going to change the mind of the religiously fervent. If we get a variant that is much more deadly along the lines of ebola ,it won't change a thing. If the people who followed jim jones could poison their children ,they will resist wearing masks."
2021-09-19 11:53:55,"Notable by its designed absence is the Pied Piper of the plague, Don the Con Trump, who by handling the pandemic as a public relations matter assured what little sweeping response we had on a national level was delayed precisely when swift action was demanded.  How soon we forget.  

This so-called libertarianism of the right is just euphemism for cultism.   Adherents aren’t concerned with others as evidenced by every aspect of their behavior.   Trump is perhaps the number one factor in our despicable performance in battling this disease, and failure to acknowledge his effects renders this entire analysis useless."
2021-09-19 13:01:42,"One possible formula for the author to consider:

10x worse = 10 times more dead anti-vaxxers (re.: Republicans)   10x more overburdened hospitals unable to serve people with other illnesses resulting in even more casualties due primarily to ignorance."

2021-09-19 18:02:28,"Yeah, What if? There would be a 90% chance Trump would be dead. He would have expired when he contracted the virus back in October 2020. A martyr, I guess. It was a close call as it was.
Also the number of dead GOP anti vaxxers would be much higher leaving the democrats in charge of government for the next generation. Many of the Red states would be either sky blue or dusky purple for the next 20 years.
This counterfactual scenario has a certain appeal."
2021-09-19 18:10:21,"When I saw this headline, I was hoping you were going to explore how deadly an epidemic has to be in order to begin forced vaccination, forced isolation, etc. Or, is that always just a political calculation rather than a medical strategy.

Ever read Blindness?"
2021-09-19 16:51:24,"The hardest thing for human beings to admit is that they were wrong. Hence, all the deniers and 'freedom' seekers won't change their minds.
We will never achieve ""herd immunity""."
2021-09-19 18:20:28,"The death rate is low enough that skeptics feel vindicated?  Yes,  they feel that way until they, their friends or family members are dying of Covid. Then, they post pleas for life saving treatments, prayers, and go fund me pages, and tell their harrowing stories of survival or the death of a loved one on social media and encourage vaccination. They still have my compassion, though I wish I had theirs."
2021-09-19 18:25:56,"I read an article recently about a young anti-mask, anti-vaccine mandate group who were attending a convention in the same Houston hotel housing travel nurses who had been brought in from out of state to care for Covid ICU patients.   I thought that one nurse was very charitable when she commented that those gathered to fight for their ""freedoms"" knew nothing about real suffering.  I would add that they know nothing about real sacrifice.  

Covid has made is clear that we've become soft, cossetted, and incredibly self-absorbed over the past few decades. 

I see no merit to any argument that the response to the worst public health crisis in our lifetimes is or should be viewed as  inherently a ""culture war"" issue.  It is not in fact viewed that way by the vast majority of Americans.  Just the highly partisan, who are always itching for a fight, and want to argue about everything.  Even this.   It's astonishing.  And depressing."
2021-09-19 18:26:19,"As @Kevin D said, the pandemic and death toll in the United States is ALREADY ten times worse than it had to be. 

If the Trump administration and Republican governors had not ignored the risks, which of course continue with variants, deaths, and long term syndromes, the US might have led the world in Coved response. As it is, we are one of the two or three worst off countries in the world in per capita infections and deaths."
2021-09-19 16:06:39,"Hayes statement is a prediction and therefore it can't be ""counterfactual"" since it wasn't offered as a fact. Mr. Douthat appears to be in full-on false equivalency mode this time to meet his contract obligation. The mindless acceptance of Republican lying on a massive scale by Republicans (80+%) isn't found on the other side. Also, where is Mr. Douthat's argument that the Republicans would behave differently if the death rate was ten times higher? Remember, the disease was a hoax that T-Rump never backed way from. And Republicans haven't met a fake hoax they didn't fall in love with."
2021-09-19 14:18:31,"On Dec 7 1941 the USA lost something over 2400 people and marched off to war that ended only with the Bomb.  On 9/11 we lost over 3,000 and marched off to war again.  Now we have lost 670,000 and people are complaining about merely wearing masks and getting a couple of shots.  This is obviously, obviously, an extremely serious values problem."
2021-09-19 17:30:26,"I think a better thought experiment would if COVID struck only the young, infants, children, teens, and took down the same numbers."
2021-09-19 13:46:25,"Interesting that folks from Stanford University published the low death rate predictions at an early point in the pandemic (before any sort of valid projection could be made) and thus helped feed the belief that covid was nothing to worry about.  

These folks and others, scott atlas etc., really are to Stanford's everlasting shame.  But when you take money from rigid far right plutocrats to fund your institutions and programs,  I guess the quality of your scholars and your scholarship might not be that great at the end of the day..."
2021-09-19 16:45:43,"RD trivialize the impact of the pandemic we have. None of his close friends or relatives have had it, so it could be worse.  1 in 500 Americans dying could be worse. I'd say that it's plenty bad enough.  Here in waiting hospitals have stopped ""elective"" procedures until at least October because of the delta surge; many of the beds in Eastern waiting are filled by covid patients from neighboring Idaho whose own hospitals are filled with unvaxxed patients. A friend's mom who recently had breast cancer can't get an MRI to check on a new source of pain because it is considered elective.  Another friend's 7 year old has to stay home because two other kids tested positive in the second week of school. She needs to stay home with him and can't work. The impacts of covid ripple far beyond those ""other"" people who contract it. It is foolish to waste time on counterfactuals when the factual is terrible."

If this nation, at a national level, continues to screw around with Covid restrictions, it is simply a matter of time before something ""Better"" comes along. Remember ""Covid""? That was pretty bad, and yet, the common sense prescriptions and proscriptions that put measles, small pox, mumps, and a half dozen minor players into the history books, were ditched to accommodate a Frat Party of hill-billy, flat-earth Governors. And in return, we got Covid-19 which is a vast improvement, if you call killing stupid people an improvement. But vaccines against Covid-19 exist.

If the disease caused hemorrhagic fever, buboes in the lymph glands, hair loss, or even severe acne, public health measures would probably have been much less controversial. But you can’t see the effects of COVID, so it’s easy to pretend it’s a liberal lie. Perhaps a variant that turns your hair Dem-blue would send the Cons racing to a clinic."
2021-09-19 01:38:27,"What crazy talk is this.
Five percent of people who get COVID-19 die.
Thirty two million Americans have been infected and 670k have died despite best medical interventions.  The cost has been huge.  Ten times worse is a fifty percent death rate.  The Black Death had a thirty percent death rate.  Fifty percent death rate would collapse health care systems, hospitals, all supply chains including food chains, making cities inhabitable, law and order would collapse and we would be plunged back into dark ages."

Who knows if we can expect more virulent strains as the virus mutates to survive and what those consequences will be. What would be far more interesting a question is what the 670,000 people who have died from Covid (equivalent to the entire population of Boston proper) would say to the fact that a virus and our response to it was politicized by conservatives."
2021-09-19 14:33:25,"I think what this pandemic has shown is we would fail as a nation in the event something even worse comes down the proverbial pike.  We failed this.

We all need to take a long hard look at what happened over the past 1.6 years and try to fix the failures."
2021-09-19 06:11:46,"To get an accurate estimate of the death toll caused by deranged Trumpists and apologists like Douthat, we will have to count excess deaths.  We don't know how many deaths from non-Covid causes are due to the lack of hospital capacity."
2021-09-19 18:14:44,"But Covid already IS >10x as deadly in the US overall- and >100x as deadly in certain regions- than swaths of the rest of the developed and underdeveloped world.

2021-09-19 14:54:33,"You got up this morning and put your feet firmly on the floor.  Sir Isaac Newton did the math an explained why to anyone who would listen three centuries ago.  Yet today you are telling folks that you can levitate even while your feet are firmly planted on your bedroom floor.  There is reality and there is fantasy. To make fantasy public health or to defend it is both bizarre and immoral. 

Just like gravity, there is no mystery here, only a curious and deadly desire on the part of some people to argue with both science and common sense.  It is tragic that common sense has devolved into a political fight and shameless snake oil salesmen abound on conservative national media.  Licentiousness is not freedom. Antisocial activity is not liberty.  Ignorance is not knowledge. I honestly hope that our republican anti vaccine friends figure this out before they kill themselves off."
2021-09-19 18:44:16,"As so often, Mr. Douthat's efforts to explain and even justify craziness is again apparent here. There are ALWAYS typo sides to every proposition. Just like you can point to some minor instance of voter fraud or mistakes in tabulating voters to justify the crazy notion that the 2020 election was ""stolen"", there are enough Covid survivors to justify the craziness of the anti-mask and anti-vexers.

American are good at ignoring the obvious. Gun violence and deaths by fire arms are at a rate in the US only matched by other countries in the middle of civil wars, like Jemen. And yes, some of the people committing violence with guns are mentally ill, so the argument is made that mental illness, not the pervasive and essentially uncontrolled gun ownership is at fault.

Another example is health care - the US has the highest per-capita expenditure for health care, yet the health outcomes and life expel chancy outcomes in the US are at best in the mid-field. But because there is always some fraud involved in government programs, such as single payer health care, the argument is made that universal health care would lead to an explosion of costs, exactly the opposite of the experience of every other country with universal health care.

Since there is ALWAYS some evidence on the other side, this fuels the completely irrational partisan positions in politics and society in general, not withstanding that the preponderance of objective evidence often points ts to ONE side being correct."

2021-09-19 18:45:12,"Europe and America chose mitigation over containment at a time when the WHO was still estimating an infection fatality rate of 3.4% and Imperial College London had forecast about 2 million deaths in the US. We were already committed to accepting that outcome, if it came to pass, Trump’s trash talk notwithstanding, as was Europe. Containment was deemed impossible. The lockdowns were only meant to “flatten the curve,” slowing the epidemic enough so that hospitals wouldn’t get overrun.

Problem is the event was expected to run its course within a few months, after which the deaths would stop and things return to normal, more or less. Now it looks likely that Covid will remain around as a six-figure annual killer for years to come. We’ll need a permanent vaccination program, and progress on treatment.

As for the next pandemic, ability to prepare in advance is limited. We’ve little idea what agents might be involved other than influenza A and the SARS-related bat coronavirus series, and no idea where it might emerge. Time window for containment could be just a week or two. Although I favor hiking the global surveillance effort, I’m cognizant that chance will enter the outcome no matter what we do. We had a lucky dice roll with SARS, and that’s not guaranteed."

It is all the local news and hospitals are talking about but conservative state leaders basically downplay it all the time even though hospitals are overwhelmed, everyone knows someone who has died, and kids are getting sick and quarantined right and left. There are conservative politicians here actually trying to go after the hospitals and the health departments here for not recommending ivermectin as a treatment and they are actually blaming doctors for “killing” people with Covid by giving them remdesvir and using ventilators to help them breathe. Some republicans here actually believe Covid isn’t bad and that the hospitals are purposely killing off conservatives as part of some kind of world order. And no I’m not making this up. Look at comments under many Republican politician Facebook posts. So I do not believe for one second if this was even a million times worse these people would act differently. They are 100% convinced everyone is out to get them. when one of them dies, they insist it is not their fault for refusing to take a life saving vaccine, they blame the doctor for killing their loved one. This isn’t everyone of course. There are plenty of people getting vaccinated now after seeing so much death. I’d like to think they are the majority but lately I’m becoming pessimistic about this."

That encapsulates the Republican response to the pandemic. It begins and continues with Trump's narcissism. He could easily have won reelecting riding the steady science-led management of this pandemic. Instead, he chose not to wear a mask for vanity, wouldn't follow social distancing guidelines so that his ego could be stroked at rallies, and then wouldn't admit that the disease was terrible when his doctors threw the kitchen sink at him to save him. Imagine if the virus was 10x more lethal? I don't have to Douthat, I easily imagine Trump being reelected and seeing deaths rise 10x more than they are now!"

Evangelical christianity, conservative Catholicism, and the Saudi take on Islam are all scissors, dividing people while making them think that the other side is bonkers.  

Science is a scissors, too.  Anti-Trump partisans are not motivated by a hatred of Trumpies so much as epic frustration with people who cannot honestly evaluate evidence (or leave evidence evaluation to those with enough understanding of science and statistics to do it) or logic and therefore cannot be reasoned with.

With respect to covid and many other things, most Democrats are not basing their views on reaction or opposition to Trump, but rather on what the scientific community is discovering.  If Trump had gone with the experts on covid, they would have accepted Trump's leadership on the pandemic while hating his style, and would have tried to keep their attacks on his style and his other policies from damaging his efforts against covid.  

Because of science, our partisanship does not have the same structure on both sides.  Ross finds it comforting, for obvious reasons, to edit things so that they do.  This makes him a religious nihilist.

Trump  ban entry from countries that were at high risk He also initiated screening of international travelers arriving here. He  gave  $ 1B each  to three companies, Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford/Astra Zenica. By December, Trump had two approved vaccines being distributed. The booster is the same  as we already received.

I was certain I was about to lose everything. My property was spared, but I know dozens of families who weren't so lucky.

Even without the fires, living in this area for over 40 years, the change in climate would still be quite noticeable. Yet, even in this liberal enclave, engage in a conversation about the obvious need for some serious societal changes in our lifestyles and be prepared for derision and ridicule.

As he is a Republican, Mr. Douthat's preference for the examination of ideas that are against the facts is completely understandable.

He is a true follower of  Professor Unrat from Heinrich Mann's ""The Blue Angel"".

The German word 'unrat"" is generally translated to mean trash or garbage. 

But, the word, in context, conveys another meaning.

The root word ""rat"" ""is generally translated as ""advice or counsel"".

With the negative first particle the word UNrat, is probably better translated, not as trash or garbage ,but  as ""bad advice or counsel""."
2021-09-19 16:20:46,"Why speculate? We already ran this experiment. Given its much more transmissible and at least as deadly once contracted, it’s probably fair to say the Delta variant of Covid is overall 10 times as deadly as the Alpha. 

Therefore we’ve witnessed in real time the virus getting 10 times deadlier and the deniers, far from having a change of heart, dug in deeper. What reason have they given us to believe an additional order of magnitude would make the slightest difference?

I foretold in my small circle of friends18 months ago that when a vaccine was developed, the anti-VAX population would slow down the country's recovery from Covid. They bemoaned childhood vaccines and found ways to belittle those that believed in them. My surprise however is not the Trump mob, I laughingly knew that they were disbelievers, if their leadership told them that oxygen was bad for you, they would hold their breath until they passed out, (a voluntary process hmm, now that's a thought) but the inner city minority populations speak of the vaccine with terror. The Covid vaccine and vaccines in general are coming under attack by a large section of Black and Hispanic people, misinformation reigns, while the death count in those communities rises.   All sorts of internet nonsense is thought of as gospel. I am not just talking about the 20 to 40 year olds but also the 55 to 70 group. 
This brings me to my point, if they are becoming Trump-like in their view of proven science, what other right wing half truths and unproven beliefs will they embrace ?

He valued his prissy ego over almost three quarters of a million American lives.  Gloried in it when New York City was initially beset.

True to form (both Trumpian and Republican) he aggressively campaigned against every proven or potential solution, even as he availed himself by dark of night.  He accomplished another iteration of Republicans' one mission: destroy faith in government, in institutions of all stripes, in science, law, humanity.

Give the sorry old man his due: he set the nation back decades in every arena of import.  The economy, law, medicine, international and military affairs and, his crowning achievement, politics and the vote.

In a few months this is going to get much worse, not in terms of death maybe, but in the reach of the plague, newly appreciated serious, lasting, expensive medical and social sequelae.  That's going to be 100% on Trump and his Republican poodles.

He refused testing, the gateway to effective response, made it a Liberal cabal.  He mocked vaccinations and those with the smarts to get them.

If the fate of every human being on the face of the Earth were in jeopardy, all 7.9 billion of us, they would still refuse to issue mask or vaccine mandates, content to let our entire species die-off for the sake of ""personal freedom"".

Why?

Because the GOP is not really a political party. It's a cult of personality in which facts, reason, logic, and science mean nothing.

2021-09-19 15:39:58,"It’s always a bad sign when Ross quotes an “expert” from the hard- right Hoover Institute as proof that public health experts across the board got the pandemic wrong.

As a person who feels empathy, I’m sincerely glad for Douthat that he has not faced the worst consequences of the pandemic. I wish it were possible for Douthat to register, and feel empathy for, the effect of the pandemic on nearly 700,000 American families. But he long ago signed onto a crabbed, cowardly form of conservatism that hides its callous disregard for human life under a veneer of childish and clumsy pseudo intellectual posturing."
2021-09-19 01:47:56,"We actually have some evidence that can help answer Ross Douthat's counter-factual hypotheticals.
For instance, you can compare at <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us"" target=""_blank"">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us</a>/ the number of deaths now, with that when President Trump issued his lockdown guidelines March 16, 2020, then extended them to 45 days. Notice the lack of support for another lockdown. The rulers do not want to decree another lockdown now. I would guess that another such mandate would be largely ignored, while it would save some lives if it could be carried out now.
I also visit FoxNews to get a more balanced perspective, and if a worse pandemic emerged, a large number of people will look to experts of their choosing rather than Fauci, not only among FoxNews viewers, but many aware of government's catastrophic failure on Covid. Though the distrust of the government probably won't reach the George Carlin's level. He said, ""I don't believe anything the government tells me.""
Some pundits have also lost credibility. For instance, Thomas L. Friedman advocated reopening the economy before crushing the curve. (He was also wrong about Mohammed bin Salman and also the Iraq War. Here's my counterfactual -- if he were a woman, the NYT would have replaced him by now.) The reopening so quickly helped undo much of the benefit of the lockdown. We must also be aware of the unethical behavior of the government, vastly limiting its own capacities in managing a pandemic."

Those who discouraged masking and taking this disease seriously in a manner responsive to overwhelming expert opinion were reckless and selfish in the same way the same types are reckless and selfish in confronting and even greater emergency- that is global warming.  

However, it all comes down to too many ignorant voters standing against science and the overall survival of our species, many believing that God will protect them from our collective behavior as long as they pray.

Trump launched with fanfare his Operation Warp Speed and pushed the CDC to approve a vaccine for use before the election. The vaccine was not around to save his Presidency, which he otherwise destroyed primarily by his negligence. The vaccine no longer had any importance to him; he pivoted to the Big Lie.
He could have continued to serve the public and his reputational legacy by encouraging vaccination. Instead, he and his wife were surreptitiously vaccinated. Although the pandemic continued to take a horrible toll, and the numbers accumulated to his own ERA, he stressed individual choice and “freedom” while tepidly suggesting his faithful get vaccinated. The more contagious Delta variant has hit his Freedom loving, vaccine hating red staters particularly hard, but in the real world, when the pandemic got much worse, when it may have counted, when he may have convinced some of his most rabid followers to chose life instead of freedom, he remains focused on divisive politics and of course, himself."

The reason: when a disease is highly lethal, most would think it wise to take some risks to avoid death. 

The H5N1 bird flu virus does not bond readily will human nose/throat cells, so a brief exposure does not usually cause illness. Most of those killed raised or handled poultry. Ebola spreads by direct contact with an infected person's body fluids, or by direct contact with infected animals' saliva or droppings. An ebola vaccine is being developed, see, for example: <a href=""https://www.genengnews.com/news/ebola-vaccine-good-news-clinical-trial-shows-strong-immune-response"" target=""_blank"">https://www.genengnews.com/news/ebola-vaccine-good-news-clinical-trial-shows-strong-immune-response</a>/ .

It is COVID's randomness - some, apparently healthy, succumb, while others show no symptoms - that drives resistance to counter-measures. Further, among the symptomatic, some are briefly ill, while others have what seem to be long-lasting damage (e.g., loss of sense of taste/smell, ""brain fog"", chronic fatigue). 

Risk appetite varies. Risk-takers (e.g., those who hike, swim, or ski alone in remote areas) are comfortable taking the risk that they won't contract COVID and/or that if they do, the impacts will be minimal. Others want to get rid of even a small death-danger risk.

You have a legitimately 'life and death' public safety threat, and Republistan essentially refuses to - or barely acknowledges - it....and then they refuse to do a thing about it...until they notice their relatives are dropping like flies.....and then they reluctantly, begrudgingly, resentfully go get vaccinated, although many have done it secretly because they get ostracized and scorned by the nihilistic, anti-reality base that is the heart and soul of modern Republicanism.

These folks have done nothing but surfed tidal waves of conspiracy, denialism, disinformation, fake science, propaganda and Facebook falsehoods for a year and a half while coronavirus scientifically marched across the nation doing its fatal job.

There's really nothing complimentary you can say about people and their leaders who systematically denied reality until it was too late.

Look at the map.

The Old Confederacy meets the neo-Confederacy, coronavirus style.

Sad."

""But that doesn’t mean that the country would have been more unified in a “Covid 10-times-worse” world.

All probably true."
2021-09-19 04:04:38,Many states have under counted Covid deaths. I don’t understand the purpose of this column. Covid is no where near finished with us so Ross may yet get his wish. And why not put your energy into ending THIS pandemic before complaining about prep for next?
2021-09-19 07:46:34,"From a six hour drive north of NYC where most of our mortality occurred before anyone but Montreal and NYC had Covid.America's mortality rate is ten times higher than what we are experiencing in this new wave.
I suspect nothing would change and America would do nothing to save people and would look to save its economy and the economy would fail because covid was handled so poorly and everybody would blame the other side for not doing what needed to be done instead of realizing that everybody should be working together and then they would argue it was impossible to work together and everything would get worse and they would blame the other side for not working together. Finally both sides would get together and blame Canada for not telling them how you decrease hospitalization ten fold and of course Canadians are underhanded conniving socialists conniving to destroy freedom and democracy."

So, of course, let’s do little or nothing now to stop today’s ills because tomorrow’s problems will be worse and bound to come . . . . Huh?

Demanding that suitable preventive measures, face masks and universal vaccinations, be ignored, is so willfully dumb it hurts. Irrespective of how bad things are now, there is no excuse in abusing one's ""freedom"" to abuse everybody else, equivalent to 'license to kill'.

Our country is afflicted both by a virus and an epidemic of stupidity.  Which will prove to be more lethal is perhaps open to speculation.

Was there an outcry when Herman Cain died right after going maskless at a Trump rally last year? How about reactions to the deaths of Texas Republicans Ronald Wright and H. Scott Appley? Or Louisiana Republican Luke Letlow?  There have been many other politician deaths at the state level. And recently three acerbic Republican radio talk show hosts, all vaccine mockers, have died--Dick Farrel, Phil Valentine and Marc Bernier. 

In the category of ""Too Little, Too Late"", even Donald Trump was booed recently, in Alabama no less, when he suggested people should get vaccinated. 

This is no longer about medicine or science, if it ever was. I would suggest these people are literally addicted to contrarianism. They want to believe they ""know better"" and are not going to be sheep like everybody else. It's how they convince themselves they're smarter, different and special.

Oh Ross, there is only pushback on one side of the aisle. The other side understands the messages we've been getting from the experts in their fields. I don't know that that could be called a 'partisan divide'. It is more like willful ignorance from leaders catering to their base. The same kind of willful ignorance that blamed and burned Jews during the Black Death back in the Dark Ages.

Because most of us don’t personally know anyone who has died.  So much for the party that values human life.  By Ross’s standard, 911 (a comparatively trifling 3,000 dead) was a nothing-burger unless you knew some in the Twin Towers.  Most Americans did not.  Yet, I don’t remember Democrats crying that having to wait in an airport security line was “tyranny.”  Know why?  Because we are not lunatics."

""  You and Chris Hayes understate the case and miss the point.  This is the worst public health crises in 100 years.  
Surely with 500,000 dead in roughly two years the Spanish Flu of 1918 had a bigger impact because the US only had 150 million people then.   That is the only disease that was worse.  Polio was and is an awful disease that sent terror into many communities.  While it crippled many and the terror last nearly 50 years, at its peak lethality 6,000 Americans died in 1916.  The number of cases peaked in 1952 with roughly 57,000.  Yet people could not wait to get vaccinated.  Talk to anyone about the time and they remember it well.  The wealthy and upper middle class fled the city when they heard the disease arrived.
Frequently we hear that over 660,000 Americans are dead in a nation of roughly 330 million or 1 in 500 Americans.  Cases regularly hit 200,000 a day.  It seems the question is not what would happen if the disease was ten times worse.  The question is how in the world has that partisan divide not budged yet?  What will it take to get Americans to look at facts and act appropriately?  What will it take for Republican leaders to stop being unpatriotic and act in their constituents' best interest.  At this point the saying is apt.  You cannot fix stupid."

This is just gross and it is also not true. Since schools have reopened in the unvaccinated and unmasked south we have seen school after school where multiple teachers have died since reopening. Thankfully death among children is rare but I live near a children's hospital and kids do get very sick and some die. Any teacher knows that kids spread illness very effectively and the teachers around them have become tragic and unnecessary victims of the political ideology of the right. They have literally been sacrificed at the alter of stupidity.

Dear Ross, if you’re also interested in the impact your hypotheses have made on public discourse, I suggest checking out the reactions to your very valuable theories on Twitter. Other than the bitter laughs they evoked, there was a good dose of outrage at belittling the loss of more than 600,000 human lives and a surprising number of people mentioning they had canceled their NYT subscriptions thanks to columns like these and articles about that Texas lawyer who wrote that state’s Abortion  Inquisition bill.And pretty please, what IS that photo accompanying your musings???

And this with stringent lock-downs, distancing, masking and now vaccination.  How many more would have died if we just did the ""Targeted Protection"" espoused by some on the right?

I guess we needed to include all the fatties in the ""Plan"" too?

No, we have a well understood playbook that we have followed for decades with novel disease outbreaks - try to isolate and stomp out while running hard for a vaccine.  The sweetener this time is that we actually paid people to stay home.  Miraculously, we pulled it off.  Yet, millions think this was a raw deal.  A raw deal was running up Omaha Beach, not being paid to surf the net while we developed a vaccine in record time."

Even if the virus were ten times deadlier those pathetic (and I'm being kind) fools would still believe it was a hoax and that a higher being literally intended for them to die at that time. In fact, given the depraved, vicious nature of today's GOP I'm sure martyrdom would be the theme because any sort of reasoned approach to governing or problem solving is beyond that party now."

He should have his medical license removed permanently and trump should be facing willful negligence charges."

Who in America would refuse to comply. It would be no different from a bomb or terrorist attack on the homeland. Americans would sign up like it was December 7 all over again. But no, TFG refused to acknowledge the danger afraid an admission would deter his re-election. Well, bad judgment is his default position on everything. Hence his defeat in 2020. 
Ya gotta play (lie, scam )the American people to get them to do the correct thing. In the Covid instance, he failed miserably. To unite Americans, you need a common enemy. That's how I would have played it. Politicians lie to Americans daily. We expect that. But it's difficult to discern the truth from lies.

But even The Rosster knows this divide is the product of the sweatiest Labors of Republican Herculeses.

Up night after night, pacing the lab, looking for clues and likely subjects, rehearsing public calumny and condemnation, fomenting fear and violence, enlisting the perfidious among the Fourth Estate (all too eager to sign on), never sleeping, rarely resting, meeting in dark cabals in fetid basements, investing energy, cash, political capital (and raising ever so much more than they put in) Republicans were solo at the long, excruciating birth, putting lives and fortunes at risk to bring this wondrous new political being into the world.

Basically, if a person became infected with the plague, he/she would be dead in a few days. The process of dying from the plague is truly horrifying. However, there were people alive at the time who thought they would never become a victim of the plague, mostly due to the influence of God and the Church and complete ignorance.

My brother suffered a brain trauma while running in a long distance running camp - he was struck by a moving car, driven by a drunk driver.  He was in a coma for more than a month. 

Today, the residual damage from that trauma is his loss of smell and taste.  I asked him once, at a family gathering, if he ever smelled anything after the ""accident"".  

He once smelled a woman's perfume and it overwhelmed him.  As I have read in this article there is some neurological research (observation) about retraining a person who has lost the sense of smell and detecting perfume. 

My brother suffered a brain stem trauma.  There is something about the chemical nature or the macromolecules of perfume, the alcohols perhaps, that penetrates the olfactory system from nose to brain.

In the meantime, as I was preparing an herbal tea, I realized that there was no scent upon opening the jar of verbena. Normally it fills the room. 
I instantly understood what was happening

I rushed to smell anything in the house that should have a strong scent: nothing at all. Even worse certain products, my nose could perceive physically but not olfactively.
For example, with vinegar or coffee, I could feel, respectively, a tingling and hot vapors inside my nostrils. But they remained absolutely odorless. 

Luckily, my taste was relatively spared (I couldn't distinguish subtle flavors, only strong ones). Each time that I would eat or drink something with a very distinctive taste (orange juice, coffee) I would actively smell it hoping that memories would trigger the brain to re-activate my sense of smell.

In the end, I recovered in about a week. I'll never know if the compulsive tasting/smelling routine helped the recovery at all, but part of it was certainly me just trying to feel that I had some control over the situation. This was certainly one of the most unsettling things that I have ever experienced in my life.

It is only a ""minor"" problem to those who haven't experienced it."
2021-09-19 21:57:00,My 20 year old daughter had Covid in July 2020. Lost her taste and smell. Taste started coming back after a month when she tried my calimari . But not smell. After a year she said she could not hear. We went to urgent cares and found out she had ear infections and sinus infections. By the time we got to the ENt he said she would never smell again without surgury. She has had a staff infection. It has been resistance to 4 antibiotics. I have watched the doctor dig mold out of her nose. He thinks he finally has the infections cleared up. She is finally getting her smell back.
2021-09-19 22:14:03,"Not the same as the flu, is it.   Covid is about more than just the lungs.  The fatality rate is just part of it.  The real story might be the long term damage many will experience.   People resisting covid vaccines talk about long term effects, the real long term dangers  will be from the disease itself."
2021-09-19 22:36:05,"Three months after I got Covid, my anosmia turned into parosmia. Cooking and baking had been my sacred, most fulfilling pastime while locked-down and no longer going to restaurants. It was my main way to entertain myself, but also my contribution to the household of a boyfriend and his two sons. Losing my smell/taste was one thing, but everything smelling like sewage, or rotten garbage, or something burning has been absolutely devastating. I have to leave the room when my boyfriend cooks for the kids. I never could have imagined any scenario in which cooking wasn’t my favorite thing to do. It’s changed my life, in the worst way. I desperately hope it goes back to normal."
2021-09-19 22:46:39,"I lost my sense of smell 20+ years ago, after using a then-new but now common nasal spray for allergies.  At that time the sprays were given by prescription;  now they (two brands that I am aware of) are sold over the counter. I cannot live in a house with gas/propane;  I use timers for all cooking as I can't detect smoke;  I recall driving down the road with my three year old who said she smelled something ""funny"", but she didn't have the expertise at that age to say if it was like something burning, or an oil smell, etc. I don't cook with herbs much because my loss of taste has been so affected, I've lost the ability to discern those subtleties.  And I've always been a great cook!  I doubt I will ever recover from this.  I don't blame my doctor;  these were new products and he'd not realized this was a rare side effect.  Even if we'd both read the wee print cautionary label, I suspect I would have thought, ""oh, what're the chances of that happening?""  I envy those who, while suffering, apparently retain enough of whatever to ""train"".  I've got nothing left.  I used to have the bizarre, ""phantom"" smells (strong petroleum odor, lasting for days, mostly) but have not had those in at least 10 years.  Good luck everyone!"
2021-09-19 22:52:58,"COVID-19 disease not only affects the lungs kidneys heart and peripheral vessels, it affects the brain and its peripheral nerves. COVID-19 virus is vicious. Get vaccinated folks."
2021-09-19 23:10:25,This COVID-19 is turning more insidious every day.  When it starts going after the pleasure senses it’s getting personal.
2021-09-19 23:28:26,Why no answers to the most important question: were they vaccinated?
2021-09-20 00:16:04,"My husband lost his ability to taste and smell the day after he received the second vaccine shot. He tested negative for Covid before the vaccines and after. The only information we've been able to find is on a YouTube string where dozens of others wrote about having the same experience, in response to a doctor who said it was impossible. I wonder if the media doesn't want to cover this side effect of the vaccine because it may discourage people from getting the shots? My husband is still glad he was vaccinated, and would do it again even with this unhappy result."
2021-09-20 00:10:10,"Yes I was vaccinated and had this same experience.  I thrust my nose into a freshly opened can of coffee and could smell nothing.  Food might as well have been plastic. No taste.

 The phantom burning smell lasted for months and my ability to accurately discern specific wine and coffee varieties and exact spices in food is still seriously diminished months later. 
 
Certain non polar solvents like isopropyl alcohol or brake clean will set off that persistent smell for days. I think my senses then misread new Stimuli as those smells, like a sensory overload."
2021-09-20 01:01:23,That for me was the scariest thing about Covid was losing my sense of smell where you open a can of coffee and absolutely no aromatic blast. After about a year now my sense of smell is back about 90 percent and the coffee aroma has a weaker punch. But my earning a living doesn’t depend on it so I’m grateful for 90 percent. As a side note to the amazement of the doctor I did not concurrently lose my sense of taste that’s how bizarre this virus is. And oh yes when I tested positive I said ok what should I do. The doctor said keep on taking your vitamins. This was before vaccinations and treatments were available. The only other thing is I had a cough that lasted for six weeks and suddenly disappeared. Now a year later I started coughing again but only a little bit here and there. Yet with that in mind and at age 63 I don’t qualify for the booster.
2021-09-20 10:24:53,I got COVID 19 in March of 2020. I was very ill. I lost my sense of smell completely. A month into recovery my sense of smell began to return. There were no weird “ghost” smells. My sense of smell improved to the point of realizing I had never this level of being able to smell and taste before. I am not complaining but I cannot find any information about this phenomenon.
2021-09-20 12:00:28,I have heard of this phenomenon...but never of the experience of a neighbor who's nearly 75 and has worn glasses for distance since his teens .Apparently a couple weeks after his 2nd dose of the Pzizer vaccine...his eyes were unable to focus on his television screen...when he took his glasses off...he found he could see the screen perfectly...and no longer needed glasses for distance..though he still uses cheap store bought glasses for reading. Being a Vet...he was told at the VA where he received the vaccine... that this is a rare phenomenon but not unheard of.They will monitor him to see why this may have happened. He carries his old glasses with him when he drives...as precaution just in case things reverse back..but it's been some months now and he's still able to see distances without glasses. Strange to see him without glasses after  all these years !! I've never heard of anyone experiencing this kind of positive reaction to the vaccine !! His wife who also received the same vaccine at the same location...unfortunately did not have the same experience and still wears glasses. Who knows...maybe the 3rd...booster will do the trick for her ??
2021-09-20 14:44:50,"I contracted COVID-19 in December of 2020. Fortunately, I only suffered 11 days of fever and, most noteable, the loss of smell and taste literally while drinking a bourbon smash.  Though I will never forget the experience, I am also thankful that it wasn’t worse.  

Aside from being a freelance writer and contract marketing consultant (for which the brain fog and lingering fatigue after 9 months have been real inconveniences), I also moonlight selling wine for one of the largest wine merchants in the Midwest.  And, indeed, I am a Level 1 sommelier.

My sense of smell has returned partially. I occasionally also smell phantom burning. akin to what happens when a cigarette burns down to the filter.

My sense of taste is capricious…I’m afforded salty and bitter, but the rest of it is day to day at best. Lettuce tastes like bug spray. Mid palate is totally gone - particularly troublesome when trying to taste wines.  I can identify some faults, but I can’t identify those distinctive smells and flavors that are the markers for particular wines…red fruits, florals, earthen qualities, etc. I can identify lime, I can’t identify lemon, for instance.

Indeed, I have to rely on my general knowledge about varietals and regions and etc. just to be minimally effective at my job.  Often, for selling wine, this can be enough, particularly for customers I know well, but conducting tastings or evaluating a wine is out.

But I’m here. I’m recovering. I’m vaxed. And I’m hoping for the best."
2021-09-24 16:36:09,Why is whether the hostess at Carmine's used a racial slur relevant? It's still illegal to assault someone even if they say something racist.
2021-09-24 16:50:21,"So when someone who's reprimanded for NOT using a mask gets a round of drinks? WHY is this manager reinforcing that behavior. SHAME on that manager. He/she needs to support the staff, not pander to the worst behavior of customers."
2021-09-24 16:57:05,"As long as the race card is immediately played right after the hostess is attacked, America will be all right."
2021-09-24 17:18:11,"Sounds like a job for a bouncer, but then we just had one killed here."
2021-09-24 17:26:13,I was disappointed that the writer chose to highlight the accusation of the hostess in NY used a racial slur. There is zero evidence that the hostess did anything wrong.  The woman who assaulted the hostess chose to throw the race card.  The writer has an obligation to present all the facts and place them in context.
2021-09-24 17:44:33,Checking vaccine cards was never in the job description of anyone working in food services. Local governments were warned that their piecemeal rules outsourcing vaccine enforcement to small businesses would result in attacks on young powerless employees. The solution is for restaurants to stop enforcing these silly rules immediately.
2021-09-24 17:59:56,"I look better in a mask.  I don't require people seeing my teeth.  I believe the mouth area is a spot where people hold a lot of tension, just look.  Just listen to them.
I don't mind wearing a mask, and if I had always worn a mask since I was a child I probably would have never gotten strep throat or a cold or flu.  I would have never missed a day of school.  
Maybe if I had always worn a mask I wouldn't talk so much today.
I know that would be a relief to others it would be to me.
So, in short, it is Americans who truly suffer when their mouths are covered and their full mouthy effects are stifled.  
As Redd Foxx so adeptly noted ""dangerous from both ends"".
One down, one to go."
2021-09-24 18:07:27,"I think the answer is to replace hostesses with bouncers, 200lb men.

See how anti-maskers behave then."
2021-09-24 18:15:20,"I can only imagine that the most confrontational customers are the same ones who stubbornly refuse to get vaccinated. Those of us who are willing to do our social duty and comply with mask and vaccination mandates are GLAD that these people are being refused service. We might not be able to force them to get the jab, but we sure can refuse to let them play in the sandbox with the responsible kids.

If the holdouts had taken the shot when it was available to them, this pandemic would be in our rearview mirror by now. I have no more patience for the refuseniks. Get vaccinated or stay home, and don't be a jerk to those who are doing their job to protect the rest of us.

I doff my hat to those patient young women who are working the hostess station and are being subjected to the wrath of the selfish. Send them packing."

2021-09-24 19:05:48,"We need to go zero-tolerance as a society on mask scofflaws and anyone who assaults a person in a service job for doing said job.

The flight attendant was hassling me, so I knocked out her teeth! The hostess said a mean word after we got in a fight with her, so me and my two friends jumped her outside the restaurant!

These people need jail time. I'm sure the guards will be terribly careful of their fee-fees."
2021-09-24 19:09:20,The restaurants and bars are where the viral spread is happening. Why - that is where people are gathering and talking without masks indoors because they are eating and drinking at the same time. When are health departments going to require good ventilation in these places with air exchange rates of a few times per hour at least?
2021-09-24 19:27:18,It's not the hosts' job to police. Restaurant owners need security.

2021-09-24 19:44:16,"I'm appalled at that manager who (not only) didn't support the hostess reprimanding customers for not wearing masks but then bought a round of drinks for those customers?! If that's your style of managing, you have only yourself to blame for staff shortages. 

If there's a few silver linings in this pandemic, one of them is that workers finally have a spotlight on how poorly they're being treated. Is it any wonder employees are saying, ""enough is enough""? Managers/bosses: treat employees with fairness and respect, support them in their job, and pay them a living wage and your ROI will be well worth it. Is that so hard?"
2021-09-24 20:18:12,"Our American culture in general, defaults to physical violence (of which I am including very aggressive verbal assault as part of) much too quickly. We are not generous, or patient or empathetic - all truly admirable traits that are not sufficiently ""taught"" and reinforced by society. Civility has been replaced with selfish belligerence, which was/is most supremely displayed by our last president and is continually exhibited by his followers in the media and congress. Add to that our guns and gun laws (unpermitted concealed carry? Stand your ground?) and you have dangerous children running rampant. We need to get back to some sense of shared ethics and I don't mean religion. I mean the notion that common decency and caring about people is a sign of strength and dignity, not the other way around."

2021-09-24 21:00:21,"The hosts should not have to risk life and limb by playing vaccine/mask police with violent customers.  The cowardly owners should station themselves at the entrance and assume that risk along with the benefits that accrue to them as owners.  If they don't want to do that, they should hire security to take on that task.   If the owners are cowardly AND too cheap, they should close their restaurants."
2021-09-24 21:39:09,"An impeccably-dressed bouncer weighing 230+ pounds should be standing to the side of every host and hostess.  You will see bullying behavior drop to practically zero, because these jerk customers are just bullies, and like most bullies, cowards to the core."

2021-09-24 21:49:39,"do these hosts check for all other vaccinations? and to those who still check temperatures...we know covid can be asymptomatic. just ridiculous. stop this nonsense.  or if you have bronchitis? do people let you in? again, stop it."
2021-09-24 22:09:45,"This is 100% the fault of the restaurant guests. People acting horrible, and becoming violent should be arrested. Perhaps security needs to be hired to protect the workers. This is where we are."
2021-09-24 22:27:28,"I'm not trying to diminish the seriousness of this situation for these women, but perhaps hire someone to stand next to the host station and impersonate Hannah Waddingham's role as Septa ""Shame"" Unella on Game of Thrones."
2021-09-24 22:37:25,"My local supermarket has a sign at the door:  all customers, staff and vendors must wear masks.  Yet when I enter, fully masked, I estimate that perhaps 60% of the customers are masked.  I do not expect $10/hour cashiers and shelf stackers to enforce these rules and I saw no managers on the floor.  

What is the point of a rule if there is no enforcement?"
2021-09-24 22:42:16,"Restaurants should only be doing take-out during the entire length of the pandemic but yet government has allowed them to be open and even allowed them to take over sidewalks and parking lanes.   Some cities still have indoor mask mandates, they apply to everything except restaurants.  One should think if it's necessary to wear a mask while grocery shopping it's not a good idea to take a mask off and sit in a crowded restaurant for two hours.   Asking for proof of vaccination - if done correctly (matching name on the card to photo id and looking at the dates vaccine was given) is a step better than none but not a job for young female hostess, restaurants should have men do this job, preferably even security guards since so many customers are immoral enough not to comply with the rules."

That's really bizarre, especially in a nice place like that. I've been going to restaurants regularly since the reopening on 02 May 2020 and have never, ever seen anything even close to resembling that. For most of 2021, restaurants here in Houston stopped requiring a mask upon entry and also when transitting to the loo, so that problem is now a thing of the distant past here. However, I did see one place recently that had three HPD officers in uniform acting a restaurant's indoor security. I have the feeling that nobody gave them any problems way back when in the mandatory mask days.  :-P"
2021-09-25 00:45:48,"An extraordinary omission for which some explanation is due: An Asian host at NYC's beloved Carmine's restaurant was beaten by three Black women (race identity is paramount in the Times these days) from out of town because she questioned their vaccine proof. The next day a mob gathered outside of Carmine's clearly operating in restraint of trade, but the restaurant did not call the police. This was outrageous, and one has to wonder how the police managed to avoid hearing the din. We need a new mayor believes law enforcement exists for a reason."
2021-09-25 01:51:10,"At one time there were things called ""manners and grace.""  If you disagreed with the Host you quietly asked to see the manager and then had the grace to step aside so the Host could help other customers while you waited.  If you disagreed with the manager, you left, then wrote to the owner or left a review which explained why you felt the restaurant's decision was wrong.

Starting about 4 years ago we had a national leader who felt the world should revolve around him.  When it did not, he felt entitled to insult and demean others.    

Unfortunately since he was our national leader many people took their social cues from him.  Manners and grace disappeared, self entitlement and boorish behavior became common place.

It is time to remember than manners and grace are the mark of an educated and compassionate person, something that is practiced everyday and especially with those whom you may disagree."
2021-09-25 01:59:14,"Seems like the same mental deficiency that airline passengers are exhibiting infects those restaurant patrons who cannot abide by rules that protect themselves and others. An epidemic of selfishness seems to be occurring. Grow up, people! Follow the rules, or stay home.

2021-09-25 02:37:36,"Another thought, after all this I think I'll stay home more and cook. I am a better cook then most of these places. I'm not a chef, but  I can follow directions and I can cook. 

That stated going out was always a social thing, meeting friends and  or conducting business. If an eatery required a suit and tie, I wore one, No Big Deal.  

Wear the mask, have the ID or go home.  See my other comments for situational clarification and solution."

2021-09-25 04:30:42,"I think this is another case of the youngest and least experienced (and perhaps female) being given the most difficult jobs. It shouldn't have come as a surprise that some people would resent being asked to produce proof of vaccination or being required to wear a mask, since  these measures have become a political flash point in the US. So, why give the screening job to someone who appears easy to intimidate? Bullies always choose victims who seem least able to defend themselves. Restaurant owners, quite naturally, don't want to police their customers, but if the law requires them to screen customers to prevent COVID spread, just as it requires them to cut off those who are obviously intoxicated, don't give the job to the most junior, least experienced and physically smallest employee."

A number of plates from neighboring tables came back to me, with the meal offerings untouched.  Good decision.

So if you, the woke customer see this, just walk away.  ""Bidness"" will notice."

It would seem all the US pre-pandemic politeness was simply a superficial facade. 
In my home state of Alaska, anyone who openly supports vaccine or mask mandates are jeered at and called out as Commies, Nazis, tyrants and worse. And the COVID-19 cases continue to soar.

Getting arrested on an airplane or badgering a restaurant desk is a surefire avenue of failure and possible arrest.  The only explanation is a lack of cognitive function and social awareness offering good evidence that you are sociologically inept and incapable of practical judgement.

As a result, the former countries have experienced roughly 50 deaths per million, while we have endured about 2,000 per million, or 40 times as many. He attributes this gross disparity to our fractured social, political and economic fabric, which displays itself in self-centered selfishness, shortsightedness and ignorance. Our blind insistence on freedom is actually an irresponsible desire to be free to infect, harm and, ultimately, kill others. The net effect is that 650,000 fellow Americans did not need to die had we responded as did those countries on the other side of the world. And all for a drink in a bar or a restaurant meal, which we evidently care more about than our fellow human beings."

I've been warned to wear mask a couple of times for forgetting to put it back after eating, but the worker did it in a very polite way, probably the result of careful training from their superiors. Harsh and public reprimanding can bring out the worst in some people.  It seems that a warning at the entrance should suffice to get people to comply: No Shoes, No Shirt, No Mask = No Service."

Even if it *seems* unnecessary, it’s not — getting infected, and infecting others, is a game of chance, and the more we protect each other the better off we’ll be. Same with running a red light: in nine out of ten cases you’d be fine, but would you risk it for that tenth time??)

This is 100% a result of the stink coming from the fish’s head. People are empowered by the irrational behavior of Trump-ites like DeSantis and Abbott, and in the same manner that the bunch of criminals bashed the Capitol on January 6th, they allow themselves to lose any shred of humanity they ever possessed. Shameful, criminal and, well, SAD!"
2021-09-25 13:21:53,"I'm sure there are plenty of former club bouncers looking for work, hire them as the first point of contact at the restaurant. Then I'm sure the hostess will get less strife and us more humble patrons can eat in peace."
2021-09-25 13:26:18,"Was it really necessary to say that 81% of hostesses are white, without adding the context that this percentage compares favorably to the National percentage of Blacks is 13%-14%?"
2021-09-25 13:47:26,I really want the follow up about the melee at carmine’s.the miscreants calling the incident racial is an affront to all people of color who show immunization cards peacefully and manage not to assault hosts. the video footage is pretty clear. I do not believe for one second the hostess used the n word. assault and lies. should be in jail.
2021-09-25 14:14:52,"The author point out that the victimized maitre d's are young women, most of whom are white; goes into detail about the attack on a Chili's maitre d' where the attackers are Black women; but strangely doesn't name attacks where the attackers are white men (it's only inferred from the pronoun ""he"").  Why is it that reporters call out aggressors who are Black women, Black men, or even white women (""Karens""), but don't call attention to the fact that most aggressors are ""white men""?   Isn't time we talk about the ""Garys""?  We'll never get anywhere in this country until journalism is more even-handed in their reporting."
2021-09-25 14:46:31,"It is truly a sad state of affairs that these young hostesses have to now also act as the front line for health and safety due to ignorant, selfish people.  What is not mentioned in this article is that in those fine establishments of old where venerable and respected Maître d's reigned supreme was also a professional ""bouncer"".  Let's bring them back and see how many people rail against their ""freedom"" not to wear a mask."
2021-09-25 14:59:20,"While tragic, surely this is not newsworthy.

We are talking about states whose electorate has already shown itself to be racist, sexist, viciously violent, crudely cruel, and willfully ignorant. There is no other way to characterize an electorate that continues to support today's seditionist GOP.

The best way for these young hostesses to deal with this problem is to move to places like Massachusetts that remain civilized. Restaurants in MA are desperate for front-of-house staff -- they won't have trouble finding work.

It's time for civilized people in these states to vote with their feet. It's time for upscale restaurants in Manhattan to hire bouncers."
2021-09-25 15:21:57,"Except for the one week we had where we thought we had this licked, I have not eaten out.  My sympathies go out to restaurant staff who, like their airline counterparts, have to deal with the angry, volatile customer.  As many have pointed out, we need other vaccines to attend school, we wear seatbelts to protect us from severe injury in an accident, yet we can’t wear a mask or get a vaccine?  The politicians who have turned a public health issue into a political one are irresponsible and should be impeached.  They are abusing their office and oath.  In the meantime, we need to prosecute these abusive customers and be clear this behavior is unacceptable."
2021-09-25 15:41:45,"Given the total lack of civility (and worse) of the clientele, restaurants should change their approach- instead of the affable smiling host/hostess model,  switch to an ideal exemplified by the John Belushi Samurai Delicatessen character, complete with karate outfit and sword."
2021-09-25 15:53:00,"A restaurant couldn't pay me enough to do that job right now, or any other front-line position for that matter. The fact that hostile clientele can't grasp the fact that these people are simply trying to do their jobs speaks volumes about their level of intelligence and/or empathy for fellow human beings. They should crawl back under the rocks the slithered out of."
2021-09-25 16:11:28,Obnoxious citizens take their cues from the behavior of public figures.  Reflect on the past few years.
2021-09-25 16:21:36,"All restaurants should have a neon message sign in front stating, ""No mask - no service. This includes everyone over the age of 2.""  And they should also have the same verbiage on their websites.

Vaccine cards _should_ have a unique QR that a host/ess can scan upon arrival that confirms vax status, if required by local law or restaurant ownership."
2021-09-25 16:34:30,Blame the government. They have no right to require a business to enforce vaccinations.
