The end result is the same:  one family has 25 cases of water they ""need"" and 24 other families have zero.
This behaviour should be regulated (and fined), during emergencies, the same as price gounging."

2020-03-19 15:35:33,"Couple of thoughts for the day;  if Donald Trump wants to take credit for understanding the virus better than any of us, more power to him.  Own it Donald, own it.

Of greater consequence is the concept ""Don't waste the crisis.""  There will be a 'post covid -19' reality.  Climate change will need human intervention (ironic, right?) to slow down, giving our lives across the planet a chance to survive its worst impacts.  Nuclear weaponry is poised to incinerate billions of us - a 'post covid-19' reality must address the destruction of these weapons, and remove the possibility that they will, instead, destroy us.  

Of the human scaled actions that must be undertaken 'pc19' will be how we view our societies around the planet.  Covid 19 underscores that biology doesn't (it can't even can't) recognize cultural boundaries.  To be most human isn't to be first economically engaged, or politically engaged - it is to be biologically engaged first.  To that end, we must recognize that borders are obsolete, that power that serves only itself is both obsolete for our needs (besides being ruthless and evil) and damaging ecosystems earth wide.  Citizens of earth must be free to travel anywhere - we are one people, on one planet.

For the moment, those of us who can are self-isolating.  Many are engaged in working to safe lives, and 'flatten the curve'.

There is an opportunity to do better, and be better, post coronavirus.

More love, less evil.  More consciousness, less rote.

As a Native and Resident of San Diego, CA, I can say just like with blackouts we Californians are extremely nice to one another even though we want to grab everything, throw money on the counter and leave nothing for anyone else. 

We still say sorry when our grocery baskets clash in the market, even though we want run them over and take their basket for our own. 

We still are nice because when we lose these niceties, we declare this uncivil and that is when hope is less.

Many Californians have the complete sole ability to pay for entire grocery stores inventory of essentials for common life, but we don’t show up buy everything and pay an army of UBERs to cart it all away to our hoard. We do not. But we will fill up two baskets at Costco per person and call it fair. It is fair.

The CDC states on its website everyday for the past 30 years. 2 weeks of food needed stored for emergencies, but 30 days is recommended. And if you need something ask. But do not complain. The stores have been partially stocked for weeks. Everyone had their chance.

It’s an international community of collaboration- much shut down by Trump. Government Scientists are silenced, refused travel, and intimidated to toe the party line. I expect the shortages of testing facilities reflects Trump’s and Kushner’s ignorance and greed in trying to get exclusive rights to kits and a cure. Europe and Asia are far ahead of us.

I just wish that the cure or the vaccine will be discovered by entities that will not take out restrictive patents and view them ways to make billions of dollars. 

The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for universal healthcare in the United States. For decades, American government begged poverty when it came to providing universal healthcare. Millions of Americans dying from all manners of treatable illnesses were tolerated until we confronted a communicable disease that could threaten the wealthy when funds were found to cover basic costs. We should use this crisis as an opportunity to improve access and Make it permanent."
2020-03-17 21:47:53,"It seems that the anti-viral drugs would be most effective if administered before the patient becomes critical and is on a ventilator. By that time, the patients' lungs have already been damaged and the immune systems response is perpetuating the damage.  The fact that the viral titers of those who are asymptomatic can be higher than those who are quite ill implies that the immune system response is part of the puzzle of the fatality of the virus and a large factor in the spread. The argument against this is the fact that most people will recover, without drugs, so there is no way to select those who would otherwise succumb to the virus without the drugs."

2020-03-17 22:06:19,"As far as a vaccine goes to prevent a healthy person from being infected, wouldn’t it make more sense to prevent the virus from being able to attach to cell receptors on the surface of certain cell types, like in the lung, before it enters the cell through the cell wall? Instead of trying to kill the virus outside, or inside, the cell? I know there’s a large number of receptor sites that have to be considered, but does the virus try all of them, or only certain ones? And would the vaccine then interfere with normal cell signaling pathways if those key sites were blocked? And then also, how to maintain the therapeutic level of that vaccine over time might be a big problem."

Other viruses die in the heat fevers produce.  Or using vitamin C infusions  as is done in China and or the homeopathic remedies used in India that stopped SARS there. I realize drug companies won't profit, but the point is to save lives. Chinese medicine has been around for much longer than the ""modern medicine"" that viruses have had several million years jump on.

The known mechanism of action for Chloroquine used for another coronavirus pandemic, SARS, is the increase in acidity of cell (endosomes) that engulf the virus once it has attached to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme receptor (ACE) sites. Once the virus attaches then enters the host cells, the increased acidity caused within endoscopes by Chloroquine along with Zinc, the viruses protective capsule is disrupted causing the viral RNA to be degraded.

2020-03-17 22:48:39,"--> for assumptions see my previous comment.

I found that under these assumptions, (also neglecting pre-existing conditions among the young) our respirator resources would last for the population under 50. The calculation depends on the assumptions; for instance, if the respirator need is four times the death rate in a particular age group, the split should be at 35 years.

In summary, I propose that people below a certain age without pre-existing conditions should go on about their lives, while the rest should strictly isolate. Once this group has gone through the infection, the second cohort of higher age should go back to work, and so forth, until the cure or immunization is ready. The actual age splits should be based on more realistic assumptions and precise public health estimates. 

The solution would allow the economy to function, even if partially, compared to full-scale social distancing, while it would save lives compared to a laisse fair approach that would overwhelm our health care system. Note that I assume that the above would happen on a voluntary basis, society buying into the idea of phased social distancing and adhere to it on a large scale basis.

2020-03-17 22:43:06,"The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to wreck both our health care system and our economy. The bottleneck is the number of beds and respirators. At any one time, we should not have more patients needing them than what we have available. The other simultaneous challenge is how we can keep the largest possible fraction of the economy going.

Here's an out of the box idea to maximize our resources and minimize the harm to our economy: staggered social distancing.

Let's divide society into two groups: high-risk and low-risk. The low-risk group contains young people without pre-existing conditions; the high-risk is the rest. Given our resources (existing number of ICU units/respirators), I propose to find the optimal split of the population.

I did an initial estimate for the US population under severe simplifying assumptions: 100,000 available respirators that each critical patient needs for one week, published odds of death in age groups, as well as the US census population distribution. I assume that without social distancing, the virus would infect a percentage of the population in 30 days and that the critical cases needing respirators number twice the death rate in the same age group.

My findings under these assumptions are in the next comment... -> pls read on."

The Vitamin C drip is a method of administering large doses of vitamin c intravenously. It will not prevent infection but has been shown to reduce the impact and duration of coronal infections.

It is used extensively in Europe, particularly Germany which has a large number of cases but a lower fatality rate than their neighbors.

The other treatment called Interferon alpha 2b was developed in Cuba in response to a dengue fever epidemic. Again, it will not prevent infection, but has dramatically reduced fatality rates of patients with viral infections similar to Covid-19.

1. Invest in education and affordable access to education, invest in universities, invest in fundamental and mission-focused research. Solid knowledge and command facts, not make-belief or right-wing ideology can give us the tools needed to face future challenges, be it in health, renewable energy, or climate change - or defense.

2. Also support the free press, because without their objective reporting Trump and Fox News would have led us down the path of a national catastrophe many times worse than what it will be (which will be terrible enough because to Trump's delayed actions).

The Ace and Arb medications for blood pressure, if you stop taking them, how long will it take for the number of Ace2 receptors to reduce on epithelial membranes....or will they remain the same?

Why vaccines? If anyone would have been immune, it would have been the Chinese population in Hubei, since SARS in 2002 started in that approximate area. Obviously there was very little immunity conferred upon them by a previous infection, so why presume a vaccine will do any good for SARS cov 2 or any other new SARS family of viruses sure to cross over in the coming years?

And most importantly, what about India? Why are there so few people affected? Are there polymorphisms in ace 2 that predispose certain populations to this virus?

It is amazing that the first such ""antitoxin"" to diptheria was prepared this way in 1890 and there is a reasonable likelihood that this same approach could be applied to the Covid-19 virus. Antitoxins do not have to cure infections, just suppress it long enough for the body's own immune mechanisms to work.

Assuming the antibody donors' immunity is not affected, this could be a valuable and rapidly available treatment."

2020-03-18 03:54:43,"100s of scientists are scrambling as there is investment becoming available. Same way since billions of $$s were available from 35 years ago for a HIV vaccine, 1000s of scientists scrambled to find a HIV vaccine, knowing fully well that there is insufficient basic research to even develop a rationale for a HIV vaccine, leave alone successfully developing a candidate vaccine. Guess what? there have been 100s of candidate HIV vaccines so far. None deployable. 

I first wrote an editorial for a need for a multi-pronged approach to eradicate HIV in 2004 in the J. ROYAL SOC. of MED. Since then I have been one of the only scientists who has been proposing broad spectrum antiviral compounds (EVNCs) from 100% pomegranate juice and CHD-FA that have been proven to neutralize a wide range of  deadly viruses including multiple strains of Influenza, past (H5N1) pandemic (H1N1) and future,  HIV, Herpes virus , SARS Corona etc. I published this in the prestigious journal VACCINE. I presented this work all over the world including at the Defense Threat Red. Agency in VA and at the Henan U. in China. There is no profit to be made and so no one has invested. I also no longer have the capacity to test. Previously at least a lab in Knoxville, TN and at St. Jude tested my hypothesis and provided evidence to confirm that I was right. 

So where does that leave me? I survive and remain fearless of the COVID-19 because I am not waiting for a vaccine or a treatment, as I deploy the magic bullets."

The opposite has also been suggested, that depletion of ACE2 by interaction with virus is the problem, and by analogy to other viral illnesses that one needs to increase ACE2 levels and could do so by treating with angiotensin receptor blockers: <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ddr.21656"" target=""_blank"">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ddr.21656</a>

The best way to know who is right is to review records of people who did badly after being infected and those who did well.

Herbs are the original “drug cocktail” - each containing an array of compounds to fight pathogens. Across the country, Americans who practice Chinese medicine are gearing up for this epidemic in their private clinics. Chinese classical medicine has theoretical foundations and historical experience in treating viruses and epidemics to lessen the severity and length of illness, and to aid recovery.

2020-03-18 01:58:04,"** SPECULATION OK ** 

If COVID-19 really does have a preference for blood type (as has been reported in preliminary research this week), and it specifically targets people who are older, unwell, pregnant or sedentary, is it fair to say these risk-factors all have blood clotting issues in common?  If that was the case, then couldn't the virus originate from a vampire bat rather than a fruit bat?  Vampire Bats also have a blood type preference for feeding (the exact opposite of the blood types that are more severely affected by coronavirus) AND vampire bats also produce anti coagulating enzymes in order to digest.  Bats in general are immune to these viruses, so would need some defence against them in their biology, in my opinion - perhaps anticoagulants and blood transfusions with the preferred blood type would work - as they do for the bats themselves.  

“Desmoteplase"" for example, is a stroke medicine that was trialled and then discontinued.. a strong anticoagulant made from the saliva of vampire bats.. surely someone is trialling this right now or other strong anticoagulants? 

Reports are saying what the age of a person is who dies, but what actual ‘underlying’ condition did they have and were they taking any medication.  For example, it could be that the virus is more harmful when someone is at risk for increased clotting, or the reverse - when taking medications specifically against it.  The reports don’t give enough information to share knowledge quickly enough."

I am also dancing in my living room, talking to friends and family on the phone and FT and taking long walks and practicing social distancing.

I am a dancer and I believe we can heal ourselves. I am interested in the advice and information doctors have on how we can prepare for this viral  war on the cells? What can we do now? Waiting for it to hit feels problematic as we are passive and agreeing to the poor outcome of the disease.

The power of thought effects our cells. Any information is truly welcome. I feel we are not powerless and as a country we must fight like hell to protect our cells and boost our immune system. Are there articles out there on this?

But the GOP has spent decades dismantling and undermining government, filling government with incompetents and corruption, or looting it, all with the goal of destroying the public's belief that government can do anything. The conservative's self-destructive and fanatical resistance to accepting the reality of climate change is rooted in this ideological conviction.

Now, with this virus, the same attitude is at work, except the problem can no longer be minimized and undermined through media campaigns.

That's far above even the highest prices on Amazon abut which there was such an outcry.  It would have been far better to allow higher prices at Amazon and let supply and demand fill the gaps.

Instead of saying democrats, can you say ""Senator Schumer"" or ""Nancy Pelosi"" or just some ""members of the House and Senate.""  Because this is a human rights issue, not a partisan issue and we're never going to get anywhere with people that support this administration if the coverage continues to discuss partisan lines in an article that's more about the human rights need.  We need protective gear for the humans that are desperately trying to care for and save the lives of other humans.  And the Trump administration is is not helping them.  The Trump administration does want to help the airline industry (that squandered its big earnings on buybacks) but not our educated, responsible, hard working people on the front lines.

It seems that the only decision he can make proactively is to close the boarders, which in itself will not solve this problem.   The irony is that, if Trump had actually made proactive decisions, he would have been regarded as a hero and would have had a good shot at reelection.   Now, only a fool would vote for him."

My daughter is an RN at a large, world-famous hospital in Manhattan. Yesterday the hospital gave my daughter a flimsy little mask. She was told to take it home in a paper bag and bring it back to the hospital to reuse the next day, presumably as long as it lasts. 

Aside from being unsanitary, this risks the health and lives of my daughter's patients and her own family. 

This is what happens when government is small and weak. This usually happens in third-world countries.

The virus is not the president's fault. But how this administration handles this crisis is his responsibility. He must use the Defense Protection Act to direct American companies to manufacture and sell hospital equipment to hospitals in America--not to China, Japan, or any other country. Not as long as this emergency lasts.

My daughter has a young baby and is expecting her second. If any harm comes to my daughter and her family, part of the blame will lie with this administration's obstinance, carelessness, selfishness, stupidity, and lack of empathy."

Instead, we close down everything because we are blind to the extent of the disease, deny essential materials to front-line health care workers, and throw money at corporations that could have been spent to keep us safe and the economy going.  I always knew that the republicans were intent on killing me slowly by taking away my Social Security, food assistance and health care, but they have really outdone themselves in speeding up the process of killing us en masse.

Every sincle day he dithers, will result in more deaths.  It's that simple.  Ideology and self-interest--Trump's key motivators-are the last things that should be driving the federal response to a national health crisis."
2020-03-20 19:52:57,"Trump needs to call out the military, order Congress to disperse, deploy military resources for manufacturing enforcement, containment, and treatment, and use the 14th Amendment to issue presidential debt to fund Executive Orders."
2020-03-20 19:53:20,"Mobilize our declining manufacturing sector to produce medical stuff? Nothing will come of that notion except more tax cuts and subsidies for Big Business.

Ford and GM factories are closing down, but vehicle production and assembly lines are unsuitable for mass-producing surgical masks and gowns. Boeing engineers could probably reverse-engineer the German- and Asian- 
made ventilators, but who would certify a Boeing ventilator? And how do we deal with all those patent protections that stymy American innovation and competition?

Never fear! China, the world's factory, is going back to work to produce all the medical supplies and ventilators that money can buy. Hospitals that can afford ventilators (up to $50,000 per unit) can step up and place their orders."
2020-03-20 19:26:37,"I understand the value in the president ordering companies to produce health Care items to help treat people suffering from this virus and sincerely acknowledge the fact that this president is anything but a leader. However, why wouldn't these companies already be producing these necessary medical items and equipment? Why would they not be jumping at this opportunity? If not for humanitarian reasons, certainly for profit. Isn't there money to be made here?"
2020-03-20 19:40:29,"Some of President Trump’s advisers suggest they are adhering to longstanding conservative opposition to big government.



Ideological RIGIDITY is lovely, isn't it.  This is a health EMERGENCY and advisers are advising against ""Big Government?""  Why aren't these same advisers advising against BIG CORPORATE BAILOUTS and at the same time trying relentlessly to lower the supposed amount sent to individuals to a trivial amount?"
2020-03-20 19:44:11,"There is no such thing as""longstanding conservative opposition to big government"". Conservatives love big government, as long as it comes in the form of massive amounts of money to the The military–industrial complex, corporate welfare, and big handouts to the rich. Just look at how in the US politicians, wealthy business people, sports figures, and Hollywood stars, have all had Coranovirus tests adminstered immediately, even if they were symptom free and fulfill none of the other criteria Trump laid out for testing. 

Trump refusal to use The Defense Production Act to save American lives is the greatest of outrages from a man who constantly proves he cares for no one, or nothing, but himself. What do these companies have to manufacture at this point anyway that Americans are in any posiiton to purchase?"
2020-03-20 19:46:45,"Companies don't have to wait for permission to be a part of our solutions. Local distilleries are now making hand sanitizer instead of spirits. Construction companies can donate masks. Subway should donate it's stash of gloves (not ideal, but better than nothing).

Neither good ideas nor realistic solutions will come from Trump, so let's not wait to be disappointed."
2020-03-20 20:12:23,"“Some of the president’s advisers have privately said they share conservatives’ longstanding opposition of government intervention and oppose using the law, and the president again suggested his own ambivalence toward using it.”

And once again Republicans prove their devotion to orthodoxy is stronger than their perception of reality."
2020-03-20 20:11:38,"This is it, the moment Republicans have been waiting for and the rest of us have been dreading. It's their chance to stand tough to ""prove"" their philosophical cornerstone that says the government cannot help in a disaster and shouldn't even try. 

The financial catastrophe of 2008 shattered the delusions of the Ayn Rand acolytes. We'll soon see if they are chastened by an even bigger blow of financial ruin, overshadowed by a rising death rate all around them, creating an increasingly frightened and enraged citizenry.

If Joe Biden and every other Democrat can't win—even if they were to run only on this issue of the Republicans' depraved indifference to the suffering of dying American victims of this pandemic—there is no hope."

2020-03-20 20:12:58,"Exactly what conservative principles has the US demonstrated in the last 3 years that is guiding this decision?

Cutting taxes without cutting spending?
Bailouts for any industry that wants it?  Casinos, cruise lines, airlines?

Bernie Sanders socialism would be a whole lot cheaper.
Conservatives only demonstrate a couple of principles that I can see- complete and utter hypocrisy, virtually no empathy and the view that the US Government and the citizenry is an entity to be stolen from."
2020-03-20 20:12:00,"This would involve Trump's friends spending money to retool and produce items to benefit the peasantry at cost. This is simply unacceptable unless there is sufficient ""skim"" built in for Trump and his cronies.  Let's all face this FACT."
2020-03-20 20:23:01,"In many cities, for example, Little Saigon in Orange County, CA, there are Vietnamese tailors highly skilled with sewing machines that comprise a network able to construct surgical masks and gowns.  This is especially true of the older Vietnamese- American citizens.  I suspect the same is true in your communities.  If this resource can be organized and activated, I am pretty sure this medical PPE shortage could be alleviated. Since these businesses are now shut, they could be tasked with making and selling masks and gowns.  My tailor and her mother and her husband would be delighted to have a source of income.  We need their help and skill set now."
2020-03-20 20:24:45,"Does it really require an order under the Defense Production Act to get companies to produce necessary supplies? I'd think that any company that could produce them would produce them, both as a public service and as a product in high profitable demand.

The only necessary government intervention might be to suspend patent or other intellectual property laws."
2020-03-20 20:26:06,"From everything I have read, ventilators and protective gear are in critical demand. Some hospitals are left to reuse such gear, which frequently is not readily disinfectable. The administration claims that ventilators will be plentiful, many by re-configuring of related non-medical equipment. But is that being done, or merely a thing that can be done? Even such alterations need time to be declared medically acceptable. Thus it is unconscionable for the president not to enforce the DPA and let the private sector manufacture the desperately needed equipment. It is commendable of Elon Musk and GM to offer manufacturing space, but they could at best only assemble parts made by specialized manufacturers of components needed for ventilators. It is nonsense to assume that states can by themselves procure these machines, as is the conservatives' mantra that the government role needs to be scaled back in an unprecedented national crisis. With the first fatalities arising from demonstrated lack of ventilators, one would wish this administration be sued for negligent homicide, but alas this is not possible. We can only seek justice through the ballot box in November."
2020-03-20 20:14:57,"""Shirked his responsibility to act during a national crisis."" And nothing else need be said. His actions are disgraceful, heinous, draconian and political. He has shown the country and the world he is unfit and incapable of leading our country in its time of greatest need. Hopefully come November the electorate will send a resounding message to remove him from office."
2020-03-20 20:22:37,"Trump must think this is still a hoax! He has a hunch that a miracle cure will be here tomorrow at noon!
We need to think about how to prevent the Trump Recession from becoming the Trump DEPRESSION!"
2020-03-20 20:18:21,"I am a practicing cardiologist in a large metropolitan area in the United States. The primary focus amongst providers and hospital administrators right now is the availability of PPE ( personal protective equipment) and the availability and turnover time of testing ( waiting 3 days or more for results). We are horribly prepared. Two days ago, we were down to 2 days of gowns and masks. We have patients in our hospital that are Covid -19 positive. We are stopping all procedures to save gowns, masks, etc for these patients. A colleague went to a craft store to buy a plastic sheet to make protect eyewear.  These canceled procedures are not what most patients would consider  elective (valve replacement, stents, pacemaker implantation). So my question is , What is Trump waiting for?!? We need to think creatively and start manufacturing PPE now as well as ventilators. And then to hear Trump’s sycophants praise his leadership today. It is a disgrace."
2020-03-20 20:22:09,"It seems that Trump is taking this as a political situation.

He seems to be going around saying that he has ordered or encouraged companies to produce necessary items, but they won't - he makes it seem that he is being ignored and victimised, as he usually does.

He seems to be the only world leader not getting on with the job of leading through this, but strutting around with his followers and henchmen, ignoring the experts, and going on about being a war-time President.

Every leader I've heard speak about this doesn't puff themselves up about war-time anything - they aren't surrounded by thugs and sycophants. Even Boris Johnson appears on screen alone and delivers messages maturely.

Trump needs to pull his head out, and stop making this about himself for once and about the nation. Then he might earn a modicum of respect."
2020-03-20 20:10:43,"Our “Do Nothing” president. All talk, no action. House passed aid bill...even the senate passed it. Where does it stand? No PPE, no vents, no tests. Nothing but words of criticism for others. Americans, where does the buck stop?"

This crisis requires the WW11 Acts be implemented.
It all is coming down to money that might not be made if the these Private companies cannot have control of the markets and refuse to help the 50 States all because Trump is incompetent and worse.

You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.” A comment like this when people in our country are begging for help? I believe President Trump knows the corona virus situation is a bigger threat than he did even a few days ago. But I believe even more that he either does not or is unable to realize how incredibly huge and serious and all-encompassing the corona virus situation is. And his advisers are doing him and our country a horrible disservice by thinking about big government at a time when our people are dying and the worst of the situation has not even hit us yet. President Trump should be relying on someone like Anthony Fauci at this time rather than his lackeys hiding in the White House."

As a healthcare worker in Washington state, I can tell you we do not have enough gowns, gloves or masks, but this president could care less if we die. He’s showed us he must protect his friends before protecting those fighting on the frontlines."
2020-03-20 20:13:32,"Now that we witnessed Trump's unhinged, unprovoked attack on NBC's Peter Alexander during a Washington news conference, we face this urgent question: Is Trump coming apart under the pressure? Alexander asked only for an expression of sympathy and support for those suffering from coronavirus. Trump ""went off."" It may be time to invoke the 25th amendment, and ""retire"" an emotionally disabled president. That, of course, would require patriotic Republicans to act on our behalf, as they are sworn to do. Patriotic Trump Republicans are a rare, all but extinct, species in these sorry times. I can't think of another solution except Election Day in November, and that may arrive too late."

I take supplies from my workplace so that I can travel safely.  Business as usual for corporate America - resist oversight in every way possible, legal, illegal, moral or immoral.  The world's richest country ever, the world's greatest economic power - we supposedly have about 20 B2 bombers, price tag $2 billion each.  They are supposed to make us safe (LOL) - but what people actually NEED for this crisis isn't available.  Yes, there will be hands in gloves, for now.  Faces in masks?  Not so sure about that.  Ventilators for my patients?  I really hope so, but...  I don't trust this government to make sure these things happen.  Bail outs for fat cats, well, naturally!  The illusion of prosperity has been rudely rent.  Don't look behind the curtain!  Unfortunately it may be too late.  Capitalism's failure to provide for the basic health needs of this country is all too clear.  How many lives will be lost, needlessly, to the failures of government?  Looks like we will soon be finding out.  

Of course once the dust settles (and it will) the question will be who can we trust to count?"

If this means nationalizing drinking alcohol plants (distilleries) then so be it. 

Every establishment, office, and  building of any sort should have strict and mandated hand cleansing prior to entering and leaving.

2020-03-20 20:24:54,"Trump does not want to mitigate the spread of the Coronavirus as he sees prolonging it helps his chances of Re-election.  There should be a World War II-type mobilization response to increase testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and protective gear, AND a Manhattan-style project to develop a vaccine and treatment.  All of the power of the Federal government should be brought to bear in controlling and defeating Covid-19.  Spare no expense, all of our lives depend on it.  Trump is in over his head and if nothing is done we will all drown.  His administration should take away his phone and lock him a room with no way to spread more misinformation."
2020-03-20 20:24:56,Obama had the economy growing at a slow and steady pace.  He also had a national pandemic team.

His policies are now going to eat into the successes of the Obama administration.  He was the wrong choice in 2016.  Do not make that mistake again.

Why is it so difficult for the Republican party to make the calculation in favor of saving lives.   If they can live with the idea that corporations are people (and should get all kinds of benefits from this tortured definition), then how about if we treat people like corporations -- throw money and services at them."

2020-03-20 19:38:43,"How many people have to die before this so-called President does his job? He's supposed to be on our side, but I seriously doubt that he is. It's all about HIM."
2020-03-20 19:43:08,"Mr. Trump said to reporters on Thursday. “The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.”"
2020-03-20 20:03:27,"Pressure needs to be placed on this ignorant and fearful man right now.  Are we going to be placed in the same position as Italy, to be forced to play God and decide who is to live and who is to die?  Washington state is facing that decision right now, here in the wealthiest nation in the world, here in a country whose ""leader"" only can see as far as numbers from supporters to Wall Street to Big Business.  It is unconscionable to even hesitate.  I may be one of those who will need to come out of retirement because our nurses and doctors may fall ill to this brutal of viruses because they lack masks and other means of personal protection.  I will do it willingly but with a prayer on my lips.  Our governors need to rise up and we constituents right behind them to remind this man in the Oval Office that the buck stops with him.  The worst president among the worst of times.  What has Fate dealt us?"
2020-03-20 19:44:51,"This is a classic example of ostrich leadership.  Republicans favor less regulation, Democrats comparatively more.  But to stand on such principles exclusively in an extreme national crisis harms the public.  240 years of presidents across the political spectrum have understood this.  The lack of appropriate protective gear will lead to a huge number of health care providers to get sick, die, transmit COVID-19 to the community, and when they can't take it anymore, walk off the job.  Nice going, Trump.  History will show the tragic buffoonery of this president for what he is.  God help us to learn from this and prepare and take seriously pandemics and what we expect from our leaders."
2020-03-20 20:00:49,This is not what leadership looks like. Step up in a national crisis. We did it in World War II. Entire industries were temporarily suspended. Do it again. Now.
2020-03-20 20:03:10,"""We're not a shipping clerk"".
Only in America would the considerations of a free market outweigh the urgency of the federal government to keep its citizens safe during a pandemic. Shameful is too simple a word to describe how immoral this administration is."
2020-03-20 20:03:51,"I've noticed that yesterday and today, Trump has begun to shift the blame for all this to the Chinese (Chinese Flu, etc.).  This is classic Trump deflection--- first, it was the Democrats' fault, and now it is the Chinese, who had nothing to do with Trump's delay in mobilizing the country to face this crisis.  As we proceed further into this disaster, look for Trump to find other, new scapegoats."
2020-03-20 20:04:22,When keeping it real goes wrong.
2020-03-20 19:43:47,"This man and his advisors are failures.  They more than likely have all protected their incomes prior to the out break and have access to immediate medical tests - we don't.  We are not getting the protection, the advice, the medicine, the facts from this sham government.   They all have to go.. they are useless and dangerous."
2020-03-20 20:00:25,"Americans are dying while Trump is dithering.  

The hallmark of a wartime commander-in-chief is decisiveness and a willingness to take full responsibility for the total war effort.

FDR, Eisenhower, and Lincoln must be turning over in their graves seeing Trump pretending to fill their shoes."
2020-03-20 20:08:02,Just what we need... ideological purity in a disaster.   We need a command approach to this as in war.  Sadly we have problems with the Executive function.
2020-03-20 20:08:19,"We need to use Amendment 25 before, literally, more people die.

We have a leader who does not know what he's doing.

Everything that was initially done was done to protect the Stock Market, his money in it, and his ""friends'"" money in it, so they will continue to contribute to his campaign.

We have had people die because Trump refused to act sooner than he did. More people will die because Trump does not know what he's doing. 

It's all about his malignant narcissism.  Even now, the people around him praise him before they speak. They know they have to. We are in a terrible place and Trump is making it worse. 

Amendment 25."
2020-03-20 19:27:45,"In other words, it is chaos, and no one knows what anyone else is doing.  Headless chickens."
2020-03-20 19:58:43,"Though I agree that the stick offered by the DPA should definitely be put to use, I also think governors are not making use of all their tools.  Take the state of Washington.  They have one of the 12 manufacturers of lCU ventilators in their state and that company has agreed to hire more people and go from 150 per month to 1,000 units per month.  That is commendable but not sufficient.  In an interview the CEO said that they are still uncertain how much demand really exists (meaning they don't want to be stuck with the tab of a giant investment in facilities, employees, and materials only to have demand crash in 2 months.  I think states (as well as Fed) should immediately offer these companies a guaranteed price for every ventilator, mask, etc. that they manufacture over the whole of 2020-2021.  Anything in excess left with governments can always form a future critical reserve stockpile."
2020-03-20 19:58:55,"""The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items"".   That is the precise function of a federal government in a national emergence.  The federal government has purchased vast amounts of items to fight wars.   Now people are dying because of Trump's ignorance and personality. The Trump presidency has become a confluence history's worst President and the country’s worst crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic.  The country needs a new President."
2020-03-20 19:59:11,"Good thing he wasn’t president during WWII when companies like Heinz were making gliders and tons of manufacturing capacity was converted to wartime use- and quickly.  You don’t get to invoke a war as Trump has done and then refuse to support it.
Big government is fine for bailouts but not for protecting those on the front lines of this?

VOTE!"
2020-03-20 19:59:03,"""We are not a shipping clerk,"" says the dimmest man every to hold the office of president.  No he's not a shipping clerk; no one would ever hire him for a job like that which is way beyond his capabilities.  He was voted in as president because he played a businessman on TV and pretended that he was charming and decisive and spoke to all the paranoia and Ayn Rand fantasies of the Republican Party."
2020-03-20 20:03:30,"The testing story is nearly a complete disaster. Even in California, the number of tests is very modest - on the order of less than 20,000 since the beginning. Clearly, the current cases numbers are far, far lower than the reality. No one on the federal govt has any idea how many tests are being run. If these mythical “millions” of tests ever become available, then we are going to see the base of the iceberg as it overwhelms the health system here — with catastrophic consequences."
2020-03-20 20:03:38,Of course conservative opposition to big government is not an issue when it comes to a woman’s right to choose and women’s health. In that case big brother is always watching and intruding.
2020-03-20 20:03:56,"This is insanity.  We all know that this ""opposition to big government"" can't possibly be the real reason our government won't do what is needed to protect our people.  So what is the real reason for this failing?  Other governments have stepped up to protect their people. Why won't the president of the United States act on behalf of the American people?  We're on the dark side of the moon, folks."
2020-03-20 19:59:17,"After today’s presser, I think he is putting all his eggs in this malaria med basket. He does have a historical proclivity for quick fixes, and if he’s convinced himself that this is easier, he’ll just fixate on it to the exclusion of all else to the detriment of us all."
2020-03-20 19:48:59,"Sadly ""Orange Man Bad"" is a truism even in this crisis. One would think he would have advisors so he could fake it for the good of our country, but no. He didn't even have words of comfort for Americans in this hour of need and could only think of how a reporter was making him look bad because people could be scared. He's the worst."
2020-03-20 20:37:17,"Firms don't need to be forced to pitch in to solve these critical equipment shortages. They just need government to provide the leadership, coordination and incentives that will enable them to do it. But I'm not seeing the urgency or competence we need from the federal government. Every hour that is wasted means that more American lives will be wasted too."
2020-03-20 20:33:37,"Trump is a danger to society. My doctor friends are shaking in their boots.  Supplies are nearly exhausted already and GPs all over the country are begging for PPEs. 2 out of 10 will end up themselves hospitalized—if there are beds—and worse will happen if there aren’t. And then there won’t be enough to treat the rest of us.  If this is what it’s like under Republican rule, then you might as well be dead. And that might just happen."
2020-03-20 20:36:09,"Once again tRump hopes that flim flam, evasion, and questioning the questioner will deflect from his inability to give a straight answer, and will mask his demonstrable inability to comprehend, let alone accept, the enormity of the situation before him and his duty to make appropriate and immediate responses. Like all the fake promises he has ever made in his lifetime, promises he never intended to keep, he clearly has broken his promise to the American people. His obligation (by oath of office) was to  protect and defend the U.S. Constitution, which impliedly involves protecting  this nation's people.  This ""would-be emperor"" is quite naked now, and we should all be able to see the sham human being that he is and the grossly deficient leadership he exhibits. 

 In times of great peril, leaders either rise to the occasion or they sink into complacency or denial by blaming others and spouting platitudes-- alas the latter is tRump's usual course and we have been witness to a particularly virulent strain of this  type of response, in all its ugliness, these past few weeks.  tRump is corrupt in his self-interest and dismissiveness of others' needs, and his administration is infested with corruption.

I hope those of us who survive until November will have finally learned our lesson and will rid the White House of this contemptible being. Then, have it wiped down thoroughly with any remaining antibacterial cleaners for the next occupant.  VOTE in NOVEMBER, please!"
2020-03-20 20:26:39,"ultimately health care is not replaceable by ""virtual"" technology and is marginally augmented by it.

medical interventions are inherently hands on and well inside the six foot boundary of 'social distancing.'

a state of the art ventilator is as useful as a vacuum cleaner absent the trained professional required to operate and treat the patient.

The Mechanical Ventilation Certificate of Completion (COC) Program provides hands-on experience troubleshooting mechanical ventilation, describing basic features of positive pressure breathing, exploiting ventilator graphics using equation of motion, and identifying key determinants of ventilator-induced lung injury. Become an expert at determining conventional settings for treating acute respiratory failure, as well as integrating new strategies for providing life support while simultaneously protecting the lung. Take these individual courses, or work toward the Certificate of Completion.

Target Audience

Hospitalists, intensivists, and critical care practitioners. Bedside intensivists, hospitalists, pulmonologists, critical care physicians, advanced practice nurses, and respiratory therapists who routinely deal with mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU.
  

...do you see the problem?"
2020-03-20 20:26:53,"His press conference today was a disaster.  He cannot accept responsibility for anything. The market was dropping the more that the words were tumbling out of his mouth.

November cannot come fast enough."
2020-03-20 20:27:07,"'John Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that corporate executives were already working “hand in glove” with the government.…""
That has always been the problem."
2020-03-20 20:30:37,"Trump: This is a hoax / I always knew it was a pandemic

Trump: I may use power to mobilize production / I mobilized production very early and saved lots of lives

Trump pretends to be decisive and in charge, but in reality flails about daily, and nurturing chaos within the White House.

Retroactively he always gaslights the public with a completely false narrative about his past decisive and prescient actions. Expect nothing different going forward."
2020-03-20 20:32:12,"Let’s wait until we need it! And when everyone realizes that by then it’s too late, the administration will do what they always do: lie about it."
2020-03-20 20:39:48,"Bullies are not leaders. They lead by fear, not by brains. Trump looked so happy at the start of his administration signing all those Executive 
Orders with his seismographic Sharpie, rescinding all those Obama era consumer and environmental protections. So what's stopping him now? Why not order a ""war-effort"" output of protective surgical masks and Covid-19 tests? What's the downside?"
2020-03-20 20:28:05,"Obviously, Trump doesn't want the government competing with companies owned by his family members."
2020-03-20 20:40:00,"were any of you people ever in business? you have an industry functioning at making say 10 million masks a year and now in a matter of weeks you think it can ramp up to 100 million+. these are physical products that require plastic, rubber, containers, shipping be produced. it's not just setting around in warehouses somewhere. and then how do you ramp down that capacity. i think government and industry has responded well. try running a business sometime."
2020-03-20 20:40:06,"My cousin is a respiratory therapist in Michigan and she told me yesterday that her hospital is short of all kinds of protections equipment for medical personnel and the respirators they will need as this virus continues to ramp up. She told me they have been trying to access them from any and all sources that they could find to no avail. 
I am glad that companies are interested in helping out. The problem isn't intent; it is the speed at which they can roll this needed equipment out. Trump has the necessary tools to make this happen quickly if he chooses to. Shoring up companies with bailouts is fine, but in the meantime, people are dying and many more will be subject to triage if hospitals don't get supplied with these life-saving items. It needs to happen now!
And I am tired of hearing about all these ""wonderful, beautiful"" companies. There will be plenty of time to take bows later."
2020-03-20 20:25:08,Sean Spicer appears at Briefing asking Trump question-Trump mistakes him for a ghost and ignores question. Guffaw--Not good time for SNL on hiatus
2020-03-20 20:28:58,"What we are witnessing here is the fundamental difference in Republican vs. Democratic philosophies, principles, and approaches to the role of Government. 

The Republicans believe that that we should have a weak Federal and Local government; ones that provides very few services, and that States should be charge of planning and leading their own populations with individuals in charge of supporting themselves.

The Democrats believe in a strong Federal and State Government providing leadership, central planning and an array of centrally provided solutions for all the States, Municipalities, and the whole population.

The Republicans believe in not taking a leadership role in the International Community... The Democrats believe in a Global Community approach led by the US.

We now have proof on many fronts of the outcomes that these markedly different philosophies yield. 

There is an Election in November...Vote for the Future you want. Vote like your life depends on it. Vote like your Children's lives depend on it. Vote like life depends on it!

You deserve the Future you vote for!"
2020-03-20 20:29:28,"But a bailout of corporations to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars is not a violation of their deeply held conservative precepts. Anyone remember ""not picking winners""?"
2020-03-20 20:34:56,I think it was pretty clear in the news conference today that companies are voluntarily doing what is asked of them so no need for the powers to be invoked. This bent article presents voluntary cooperation by companies as a Trump weakness.
2020-03-20 20:36:16,"The United States of America does not have a functioning federal government. Nothing can be allowed to come before We, the People!"
2020-03-20 20:36:31,"People we personally know and love will die because of the ineptitude of this Administration. Any competent manager would be able state how many masks, respirators, ventilators and test kits will be available over the coming 30 and 60 days. Instead, we get meaningless statements about great phone calls and good meetings, and the false hope that an untested malarial medication, whose supply is unknown, will rescue us.  

This is very basic supply and demand management, and this Administration — not just the President — lacks this fundamental capability.  There is no free market economist who ever said that the free market should independently manage supply and demand through grave national emergencies."
2020-03-20 20:25:52,"""not a shipping clerk.""  and what does the military do?  What goes on in the Pentagon?  They procure lots of stuff that is shipped to military bases around the world."

2020-03-20 20:26:50,"The stable genius must think that 800,000 ventilators are something that he can order and get it next day on Amazon Prime. It takes time for GM to retool and GE to ramp up. If we don't get going now, people will needlessly die in a few weeks.  Meanwhile, he keeps offending Chinese that we may need for protective gears, masks and ventilators in case of shortfall."
2020-03-20 20:26:58,"Now is the time to act—before this epidemic gets bigger.  We need medical supplies now. People can’t find basics like toilet paper, Tylenol, bleach, and thermometers.  If you can find it online, you will be told it’s sold out when you go to pay, or it won’t be delivered until May even if you pay for expedited shipping. 

We need the Federal Government to step up. This situation is only going to get worse."
2020-03-20 20:28:59,"When this is over and Biden is the White House and the house and Senate belong to the Democrats, we will see Trump's tax returns and he and his children will likely go to jail screaming out the names of the others in his administration that also personally profited during this time. 

I never imagined I would ever see the leader of the free world more concerned about his numbers than the welfare of every human being on the planet. 

When the smoke clears, Trump will go down hard for this."
2020-03-20 20:30:55,"Did I miss something at the presser today, or did Trump say he'd ordered a million doses of malaria medicine from one of his favorite drug companies - medicine which has no scientific relationship to Coronavirus - based on a ""gut feeling"" that it would work? 
Really hoping I'm wrong about that."
2020-03-20 20:31:43,"Perhaps the NYT could publish the names of many of the companies whose factories and other resources could be helping out but are not.

In this manner, We the People will be better able to fill the massive leadership gap (gaff?) in the WH, and lead with our wallets, now and in the future.  We can, so long as reasonably possible and for long after this crisis is over, boycott companies that drag their feet or flatly refuse to step up without the federal government forcing them to do so.  And I mean not only personally boycotting, but also in the B2B space as well.  Ask your employer to use their clout to press manufacturers into action."
2020-03-20 20:37:46,Does it appear to anyone else that he is TRYING to make the situation worse?  Maybe to cancel the election?
2020-03-20 20:38:51,"The big question is Why Not?  How does it serve Trump not to have enough masks and protective gear for medical personnel?  Did Trump and his family make money from the stock market crash like the two Rep Senators did?  What about Jared and his brother benefiting from setting up a testing company?
Is it greed that is still the ultimate driver for the Liar/Denier in Chief and all those GOP enablers?"
2020-03-20 20:30:04,"The reality here, as in any healthcare reform, has always been that places that need it most and are least prepared decry loudest the “intervention”."
2020-03-20 20:33:18,"For the well-being of America during the current novel corona pandemic this president should not appear again on a public podium in front of TV news cameras and reporters. Trump and Pence have become the largest source of misinformation at a time when the country needs truth and confidence. Neither of these political hacks are medically qualified so they should never talk about any medical issues-period. 

As the country, along with Canada and a host of EU and Asian countries try to put up their best levels of defence against the virus economic issues are intermixed with medical issues. A big problem for Americans is that there is no social safety net for millions of Americans which will exacerbate the inevitable recession and prolong recovery."
2020-03-20 20:33:48,"Congratulations to the Republicans reps in the Senate and Congress that stood by Trump's side and now he is turning his back on your constituents.

Trump approved tax cuts for Corporate America, but he isn't willing to stock labs and order more medical supplies, including masks, produced?  

Are you listening, Trump supporters?"
2020-03-20 20:34:44,"The president needs to come up with the numbers that explain his hesitation ordering companies to make what is needed. What are the numbers of this and that that other companies that are stepping up to the plate plan on making as he mentioned. ""Long standing conservative opposition to big government"".

Living in La La land!"
2020-03-20 20:36:09,"Of course, our businessman-in-chief resisted early on any impulse that would prompt manufacturing businesses to increase production.

Items such as mask. that medical authorities need desperately, and are in short supply.

Mr Trump knowingly allowed businesses to ""manufacture"" shortages, causing prices increases...vis-à-vis...increasing profits

Profits placed ahead of health and safety."
2020-03-20 20:37:19,"in times like this, you find out who is a leader and who is blowing smoke. When hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers are saying that they are in desperate need of protective equipment and you do not do everything possible to procure the goods, you are a crisis manager. Auto manufacturers are going to produce ventilators. What about gowns? masks? face shields? gloves? India stopped its domestic face mask manufacturers from exporting in mid February. Certainly we still have the wherewithal as a country to rally in this time of need? Wartime contracts are guaranteed.  What is the President's problem? We need hundreds of millions of the items mentioned above."
2020-03-20 20:47:20,"While it is a nice idea to say lets mobilize industry and force them to produce something, the reality is that it is not doable for the products needed on the time scale needed (Next week or so for some items). Even for something as simple as masks, you need to purchase and install the equipment. Respirators are non-trivial devices to manufacture and much of the current supply chain is in other countries. If one wants to develop the manufacturing capacity for a product needed in a month or so it would be doable, and I am pretty sure that companies that make these products are doing that currently since they know there is a market for these products. It makes much more sense and would be faster for companies currently making these products to scale up production than to ""mobilize industry""."
2020-03-20 19:05:35,We need all hands on deck approach. No ideologies about big govr.
2020-03-20 20:28:33,"So much for pro life, eh?"
2020-03-20 20:29:12,"Fatso Trump's ""Pandemic"" conduct is tantamount to murder.

2020-03-20 20:42:56,"What the hell do we care about ideology, “political principles” (which as practiced by some is an oxymoron — if the shoe fits...)?  The Republicans left conservatism wheezing and whimpering three and a half years ago when it embraced Trump, deficit spending and governmental and judicial activism.  Now that people are dying, they think it’s a good time to invoke that which they’ve been summarily rejecting?  You elected them, America.  Think elections don’t matter?  Think the “deep state” needs dismantling?  Think again.  If you are able to think."
2020-03-20 20:44:54,"Here are some facts:
1.Trump refuses to use the power of the Presidency to help alleviate the shortages that are contributing to a national crisis (<a href=""https://nyti.ms/2U7IJZ9"" target=""_blank"">https://nyti.ms/2U7IJZ9</a>).
2.Russia is deploying coronavirus disinformation in Europe (<a href=""https://nyti.ms/2TZKrLT"" target=""_blank"">https://nyti.ms/2TZKrLT</a>).

I can connect the dots here.  Can you?"
2020-03-20 20:45:21,"But if Trump had to force manufacturers to make military weapons, & other MIC  toys, he would have no problem dumping the ideology.

2020-03-20 19:11:17,He’s the worst leader this Country has ever seen throughout history!
2020-03-20 19:12:22,"Conservatism, along with the myopia, parochialism and ignorance that stood it up on its mummified two legs, may finally perish with few to mourn it.  Hopefully, we don't all end up in a mass grave with it."
2020-03-20 19:50:09,"Are you kidding me? You are not a shipping clerk, really? You have to do whatever it takes to help Americans, we paid your golf classes...If you have to mop floors you do, if you have to buy masks you do, do you job!"

TESTS.
VENTILATORS.
MASKS.

NOW."

2020-03-20 19:36:49,"Republicans won't manufacture anything if the income does not come to them. 

The Liar-in-Chief with the Republicans are willing to destroy the normal lives of people in our country.

2020-03-20 19:56:19,"""[P]eople familiar with the administration’s actions say the administration is still trying to figure how industry supply chains operate"".

Remember ""Only I can fix it""?  This is your ""stable genius"" and ""billionaire business titan"", Trumpsters.  We warned you.  Over and over and over, but you wouldn't listen because owning the libs was more important.  Well, in about 10 days yours eyes are going to be wide open and you won't be able to ignore what you see anymore.  Too bad the rest of us will have to experience it along with you."
2020-03-20 20:03:04,"Our ship of state is about to cut its own towline (masks, ventilators, tests, beds) and our fearless leader clings to his quart of strawberries."
2020-03-20 20:25:15,"Anyone aware of Donald Trump's dumping of financially toxic casinos into public stock offering; his predatory sales tactics of Trump U; and his shady inheritance tax trick being investigated by NY state -- WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF Trump's denial of Coronavirus; his refusal of WHO test kits; and his ties to virus-tester Applied Biosystems (a brand under the Life Technologies brand) of Thermo Fisher Scientific corporation.

Anyone aware of the Saudi-UAE blockade of Qatar that ushered in Jared Kushner's miraculous 100-year lease deal to unload his $1B-debt-coming-due albatross (666 5th Ave) -- WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF his family/financial ties to Oscar that recently purports to be “the first testing center locator for COVID-19 in the U.S.”

Trump & Kushner are high-stakes gamblers and they are in position to rig the game.

2020-03-20 19:28:57,Every day Trump finds a new way to fail.
2020-03-20 19:51:32,"Since the loser and In-on-Ukraine pence are too busy breaking laws, preserving (anti-)Christian nihilism-NOT-""conservatism"", twitting, and calling the pathogen a ""Chinese Virus"" to do their job, President Pelosi ought to step up and take the oath.

She's the obvious legitimate office holder since Clinton's never took it, and it's not like they'd notice she's taken over while they heed Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson's latest fatwas."
2020-03-20 20:40:32,"It is the very nature of government to step in and do what is necessary to protect the citizens of that nation, otherwise why even bother to have a government.

What we need right now is a president that knows how to get the job done and done right.

What we have instead is an egocentric fool."
2020-03-20 20:06:11,"This dude, Donald, is beyond incomprehensible. He resists it because he lacks the leadership. He is con and faux president."
2020-03-20 20:10:31,"Evil is an apt description of Donald Trump and his Republican party. They reek of incompetence, willful negligence and corruption. Look at Senators Burr, Loeffler and Inhofe, using inside information of the coming Corona Virus calamity and selling stock, yet blatantly and criminally lying to the American people to please Trump. Wake up America!"
2020-03-20 19:22:25,"He will invoke the Act when it is too late and thousands will die who could have been saved including the very medical professionals we are all counting on. He will then say nothing could have been done and it's not his fault, blame China and abuse some journalists for being mean to him. His voters will buy this bullhockey because they always do."
2020-03-20 20:50:18,"In the UK this week several companies including car manufacturers have responded to the government's call for 20,000 ventilators to be produced in the next few weeks. They have been given blueprints for these items and will divert their manufacturing capabilities to meet the target.

The last time this sort of thing happened was during World War II. I'm no fan of Boris Johnson but he's stepping up and doing what's needed at this time. More importantly, the companies involved have also stepped up to offer their services to what is now a wartime effort. 

This isn't a time to kow-tow to rich industrialist pals, brag about your polling numbers and just  pretend it's going to go away. Our countries need leaders right now. Trump isn't a leader."
2020-03-20 21:00:40,"“Some of the president’s advisers have privately said they share conservatives’ longstanding opposition of government intervention.”    So, the US, one of the wealthiest nations on earth, we will have failed protect the lives of our own citizens — because of political opposition to government intervention. 

Thousands may die needlessly for a lack of basic medical supplies because this administration does not ”believe” in government intervention.  Yet we give billions and billions toward defense and tax breaks and havens to the private sector.  This administration must understand that this is government intervention as well.

Who will benefits from these decisions?  What is the role of government?  If a government cannot protect its citizens, it has failed the 99.9% of us."
2020-03-20 21:51:39,"Are we finally going to throw this free market ideology overboard and act in the national interest? The would appear to be no harm in invoking the act to make it clear that this is a national priority. If the companies are already cooperating, then it will not hurt."
2020-03-20 21:55:37,"Just because we'll order something when we need something does not necessarily mean that ""something"" will be available. How much time would the R&D (Research & Development) labs need? Also factor in the trial and error period. There are no arsenals of magic wands."
2020-03-20 21:58:42,"I've seen a lot of anger directed at individuals who aren't really self-isolating, but part of the problem is the mixed messages they are getting. It's not just states and local governments adopting different approaches from the federal government, it's Trump waffling back and forth from moment to moment. One thing you'll find among the countries that have weathered the storm better than others - like Signapore, Taiwan, South Korea - is consistent and coordinated strategy. That includes a consistent message to the public. This kind of ""it's a big deal sort of but not really"" approach is not the way to go."
2020-03-20 21:22:04,"So people who need tests still can't get them and doctors who are running out of protective gear can't get it. 

Trump seem to actually believe that successful spin actually gets rid of the problem. Does he still think, ""This is going to go away"". 

How can we expect a man who could not even make a casino profitable solve this challenge."
2020-03-20 21:21:56,"Trump is an observer of the American Government. He views actually personally doing things as being a ""shipping clerk.""
His role is to report to the people what ""people are saying."" And who told him what ""very strongly."" And what will happen in a 
""very short period of time."" And with whom he had a ""perfect call."""
2020-03-20 21:30:09,So the governors are responsible for acquiring resources for their individual states.  Are the states now going to be competing with each other for scarce resources?  How is this efficient and fair? Wouldn’t a single purchaser (the federal government) get the best deal quicker?
2020-03-20 21:32:16,"This is leadership? With Trump, it's impossible not to assume--not be suspicious or wonder about, but to assume--that his financial self-interest is driving his decisionmaking."
2020-03-20 21:51:05,"At its core, the U.S. government's essential functions are: providing leadership and coordination of supplies during a crisis, preventing financial meltdowns, protecting Americans from foreign assault, and other such vital roles. No one thinks of these as ""big government.""

During a crisis such as this one, all eyes turn to the government for help. No one is crying ""big brother.""

Mr. Trump forgets that his ""base"" is no different from ""liberals"" when it comes to reaching out for help. He'll find out in November how many small-government afficionados there are among them."
2020-03-20 21:12:47,"God bless all medical professional putting themselves on the front lines against this pandemic.  They deserve so much better than the (lack of) protection that they are getting from this administration.  Human lives are at stake and keeping our medical professionals properly equipped is a) the very least that they deserve when putting their lives on the line and b) absolutely vital to keep these essential workers healthy.  As this disease ramps up, medical workers will be in short supply, and if we can't provide them with basic protection, needless lives will be lost."
2020-03-20 21:16:30,"Trump who recently erased history and claimed that he knew the virus was bad back in February has - therefore - had a whole month to 'figure out supply chains' and use his moral authority (as if) to get companies to step up to fill the demand for the health care system to function during the crisis.  Now Mar al Lago is closing.  Imagine if he donated - because why would a billionaire need help from the government - the hotel to be an ICU  hospital for virus patients, and donated the Air Force One and Two clones (since he and Pence must shelter in place for the duration, in solidarity with the rest of us) to ferry patients there from places with maxed-out health care.  Now that would be what a real leader who understood that The Buck Stops at the Oval Office would do."
2020-03-20 21:37:12,"This is an EMERGENCY.  EMERGENCIES require immediate, targeted attention.  Enough with rhetoric and inaction from this Administration."
2020-03-20 20:52:18,"Trump and Kushner et al have't yet figured out how to maximize personal profit. As soon as that happens, the wheels of industry will turn full tilt."
2020-03-20 22:03:26,It hardly takes a law to force companies to ramp up production of profitable products.  Mr. Trump is doing the right thing to hold off on legal compulsion when he knows that business owners' self-interest will do the trick.
2020-03-20 20:49:58,"It would be much better for the public if he let the medical professionals provide the information.

He has absolutely no credibility on this-or really any other-issue and needs to go where we can't see or hear him."
2020-03-20 20:54:50,"I’m an ER nurse in NV and as of my last shift, we have to sign out N95 masks. These are supposed to be single use be we are allowed 1 and are to use it on multiple patients for as many shifts as possible it until it is broken. We are using single use surgical masks for entire shifts. We are no longer testing for the flu or covid-19 unless the patient is sick enough to be admitted to the hospital because there isn’t enough enough reagant. To test for covid-19, we are only using 1 swab instead of the previously directed 2, likely leading to more inaccurate testing. I hope this experience will at least lay bare the conservative indifference to human life in the face of profit."
2020-03-20 21:56:07,"Philosophical differences, be damned! Trump's refusal to demand companies to produce necessary supplies is malpractice and negligent.  If people die because of a lack of those supplies, then his behavior will have become criminal.   It is essential that he orders companies to produce those supplies now!"
2020-03-20 22:09:08,"I'm old enough to remember WWII.  I'm very glad Trump wasn't the President.  In an emergency like now we need clear guidelines that reflect the situation accurately.
Manufacturers need time to stop manufacturing one thing and set up the production line for something else as well as have the supplies needed to manufacture a specific item.
It would be a good idea if President Trump visited a manufacturer to become familiar with the process of producing a specific item."
2020-03-20 22:09:21,The pandemic hasn't impacted the demographics where Trump's base live. Since Trump's approach is reactive instead of proactive - the latter may have to happen for Trump to enact The Defense Production Act.
2020-03-20 21:55:24,"Conservatives have ""longstanding opposition of government intervention and oppose using the law"" to ramp up production of coronavirus supplies. This is, actually, literally, unbelievable. How can this be? I don't want to wish disease or death on anyone, but will it take the illness of a Trump family member, a Cabinet member or VP Pence to change this? Yes, I think probably so."
2020-03-20 21:31:10,"Two options for why he is doing this: First is that his donors' companies are ramping up their ability to make any of the needed stuff and he is buying time for them to be in the bids OR secondly, he is waiting till he has enough ""loyal"" staff that they can rig the bids to give his donors' companies first dibs. Pick one"

2020-03-20 21:59:49,"It has nothing to do with ideology; this is solely because Trump and his team lack the desire, or more probably the ability to coordinate a response."
2020-03-20 22:01:23,"I have listened to and observed Trump during the past couple of months and feel he is unqualified to reassure the American people. As for republicans, I'm not sure which ones are qualified but I was appalled at Sen. Burns of NC and Sen. Loeffler of GA. Apparently, Burns was especially offensive because he lied to the nation about U.S. preparedness and after finding out about the scope of the problem, he cashed out."
2020-03-20 22:10:53,"It makes my head hurt when I contemplate that the Right's nastily simpleminded dictum -- ""Government is not the solution, government is the problem"" -- in the main approaches being a true statement in direct proportion to the degree to which they believe it and work to put it into action."
2020-03-20 21:16:45,"How can his poll numbers be so high? I just don't get it. Maybe when more of his supporters die, those still living will see the light, but I doubt it."
2020-03-20 21:12:34,It's disheartening to see how the lack of perspective by government officials is jeopardizing front line health care workers. Who is going to care for patients if healthcare providers are ill or quarantined? How about doctors who are unknown carriers infecting vulnerable patients and their family members? It's an abomination...
2020-03-20 20:56:31,"""Republicans have not been openly critical, but some governors have been explicit in describing their difficulties in depending on the private sector for medical supplies.""

At today's White House press conference, HHS Secretary Azar was asked what the federal government was going to do about the difficulty that health care workers are having in finding such things as reagents for testing and personal protective equipment.  He dismissed such problems as ""anecdotal"" and essentially said that doctors and nurses weren't being creative enough and could solve these problems themselves if they just tried harder.  This Administration's combination of arrogance, callousness and incompetence is absolutely disgraceful."
2020-03-20 21:06:00,"trump thinks we are ""at war against an invisible enemy"" and considers himself ""a wartime president"". What's holding him back?"
2020-03-20 20:55:31,"Trump's naive downplaying of the dangers of Covid-19,  followed by the absence of testing kits and woefully short supply of hospital resources, has put our country in this crisis. Remember this is the guy whose budgets each year suggested cutting funding for the CDC."
2020-03-20 20:56:51,"What constitutes a ""worst case scenario""? How many casualties will be required for that qualification? Ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million? Here in my state of NJ four members of one family--a mother and three of her eleven adult children--have succumbed to the Coronavirus. In this particular instance, what would the ""worst case scenario"" be? If the entire family plus the 27 grandchildren were to die of this virus?"
2020-03-20 20:44:00,"Trump's a Sideshow. America can survive-it just cannot survive another Trump Administration. Requires Big Picture and how to plan from now on.
Dr. Michele Barry of Stanford on Democracy Now---032020
But it's a very important question when this all quiets down-we're sort of in the thick of this epidemic- I think we need to pay more attention to this concept of what I'm calling human and planetary health. We're actually trying to build a new center for human and planetary health at Stanford."
2020-03-20 21:09:31,"Trump, et al. just want to spread the crisis windfalls around to their favorite industries and, most importantly,  their own portfolios. 

No real surprise about any of this."
2020-03-20 21:02:51,"What does he have to gain by NOT invoking the DPA immediately? That's what the press needs to investigate. Because if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, it's that his own gain is ALL that matters to him."
2020-03-20 21:06:13,Trump will do this as soon as he figures out how make windfall profits from the companies he mobilizes. He sole motivation is making money and getting re-elected.
2020-03-20 22:11:48,"The supply of face masks in industry doubled when the FDA approved the use of masks manufactured for construction in the medical services.  The production capacity today is four times what it was two weeks ago.

Equipment with more complicated technology, like ventilation machines, has been ramped up by increasing shifts and weekend work and will continue to ramp up as manufacturers shift resources from other activities.

Trump could order GM to manufacture ventilation machines, but they aren't going to be able to do it any faster under Trump authoritarianism than they will voluntarily."
2020-03-20 22:04:37,Is Trump holding off so his kids can make the necessary stock transactions before handing out big government contracts for medical equipment?
2020-03-20 22:07:46,"What is the fascination among ""liberals,"" who supposedly are in favor of open borders and personal freedom, with the Federal Government taking over companies?   Adding ""government"" to something doesn't make it better, it almost always makes it worse.   In the old Soviet Union, the government owned and ran EVERYTHING, and you couldn't get decent food or a pair of shoes, let alone ""health care.""

Leave private industry alone.   If you want them to do something or make something, do what the rest of us do - write them a check."
2020-03-20 21:02:59,"I really don’t understand the Republican/Chamber of Commerce  endgame here.  Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths later, what’s the plan?  Is it to cover everything over with propaganda and try to win that way?  Is it to create chaos, cause a societal breakdown and then seize absolute power?  Do they really believe their own lies?  I am genuinely mystified."
2020-03-20 21:30:57,"The Longstanding conservative dedication to proving government useless by making it as ineffective as possible, that is.  We need a government that functions--now."
2020-03-20 22:06:51,"Can’t the current GOP ever be practically minded instead of ideological ?  Esp when they have no compunction supporting industries like, say, oil, gas and banking.

And at a time when the economy is stalling, what is wrong with manufacturing products we actually need NOW?"
2020-03-20 21:36:11,"Let’s call this the Trump Virus. He got rid of the NSC’s global health security and bio defense office, established to deal with health crises, has tried to slash funding for the CDC, and continues to fiddle and twiddle as the world burns so it is only reasonable we give him this anti-honorific.  So what if the virus originated in China, Trump’s abject incompetence in dealing with it here, the world’s largest economy, has helped throw global markets into a panic with some economists saying we may be on our way not to just a recession but a depression.  If so, Trump Virus may be the least objectionable of the terms Trump will have to bear."
2020-03-20 21:58:30,"Where are the ""All Lives Matter"" supporters? Patients and healthcare workers will die without protective gear and respirators. Trump can order the productions of these live-saving products, but he won't. Apparently all lives DO NOT matter to conservatives (i.e., after they leave the womb). The conservative 'philosophy' that would adhere to political dogma during a pandemic that will be lethal to many thousands of patients and healthcare workers is a political disease without sense or merit. ""Free markets' will not win military wars as they will not win microbial wars. If the COVID-19 pandemic is not a national emergency - what is?"
2020-03-20 21:03:43,"Although I might have resisted the idea earlier today, having read a news article in the usually conservative Wall Street Journal about dire conditions in our New York hospitals, we have reached a worst-case scenario. 

Mr. Trump had better get to work. Enough big talk."
2020-03-20 21:05:21,"Trump's exchange with the NBC reporter about Trump's ""feeling"" about using the malaria drug as a solution to the coronavirus was scary and telling.

Trump is promoting voodoo science as a quick fix to the pandemic, and angrily lashing out when challenged.

About the time he was promoting his fantasy, the markets began to give up a small gain and eventually closed 5 points down.  If they were watching, they saw a ""leader"" dithering away precious time to act on an actual solution to a health and economic crisis, and starting to crack."
2020-03-20 21:04:23,"It's becoming increasingly easy to see through the cracks in the polite house style of Times reporters that the President is erratic, self-contradictory, and highly emotionally labile.

As for Republican worries about ""big government,"" we're finally seeing that by ""big government"" the Republicans have always meant ""government that effectively addresses the needs and interests of the people.""  Yep, they're flat against that.

But that's an old story.  The unspoken but real story here is that the President is deteriorating, increasingly far beneath his default level of unfitness.  He's Captain Queeg, and the storm has broken, and the ship is in danger of foundering, and his junior officers are staggering their way to the podium to say that no captain has been so great since John Paul Jones."
2020-03-20 21:45:29,"Mr. Trump likes to project that his is a strong leader. But when it comes to the point where the nation really needs his leadership to work, he dodges and responses with hollow promises. Mr. Trump, belittling reporters in the briefing room does not make you a strong leader, it only shows to the world that you are a 9th grade bully. A great leader should be humble, have vision, be able to act decisively. These are also the qualities that we need the most from a leader at this critical moment. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has none. I don't know how future historians would pen our President for his leadership during this moment. But should I say we were fortunate that we had FDR during WW2 and JKF during the Cuban missile crisis? I can't imagine what would we end up with if it were the present President. 

Stay safe, and please stay at home for medical workers who are real heroes in this fight against the coronavirus pandemic. When Mr. Trump is offering his lip service, medical workers are risking their lives for saving those in need. When this is all over, all the credits should go to the medical workers instead of the President.  God bless USA."
2020-03-20 21:26:34,"While Trump continues to crow and pat himself on the back for his ""Perfect"" response to this crisis, here's what his administration has actually been doing:

""At a meeting of finance leaders from the Group of 20 industrialized nations in February in Riyadh, U.S. Treasury officials pushed back against a stronger statement about the coronavirus outbreak, relegating it to a passing mention as one of several risks to be more closely monitored in the group's communique here multiple sources familiar with the talks said.""

Anyone who believes a word that comes out of Donald's mouth needs to go back and read the history of his 6 bankruptcies.  He was telling his contractors the day before he filed that ""All is Well!"" and the check was in the mail...."
2020-03-20 20:47:11,"Amid all the phony rhetoric and empty promises, we hear of our health care workers, wearing masks multiple days in a row, having to try to manufacture some of their own supplies, and urged by the CDC to consider wearing bandanas as a stop-gap measure. If hundreds of thousands begin to die  because hospital systems are overwhelmed, will that prompt the right-wing zealots and Trumpistas to get back to reality ..... I doubt it."
2020-03-20 21:17:40,They didn't mind big government when it was handing out $1T to corporations and the 1%. Now it's a problem.
2020-03-20 20:44:03,And yet today i read that one poll said that more than 50% of those polled said that Trump was doing a good job with with this crisis.
2020-03-20 21:32:10,"I fear that until the U.S. suffers four regional catastrophes on the scale of what's happened in Northern Italy, our Federal Government will remain staunchly dedicated to PR about, not production of, the PPE our hospitals need. A week from now will be too late to *start* taking this crisis seriously."
2020-03-20 20:46:59,"If COVID-19 is the cause of a national emergency, then it requires a national response from the national government. No one is suggesting nationalizing all manufacturers for all time, but we need leadership and coordination that does not leave every company and every state to their own devices.  

Remember, companies are not really, despite how some want them treated, people, so let's just skip the trammeling argument and get to work."
2020-03-20 22:08:35,"The companies in general aren't volunteering to do it gratis - they need to get paid.  The bottle neck is funding.  

The government can offer up contracts and take bids.  Actually the most efficient way to go.  A lot more sensible way to spend money than releasing 1.5 trillion in repo and QE and hoping against all odds that companies will simply do the right thing with that cash and not hoard it.  (Hint: they won't)."
2020-03-20 21:34:02,"It's a hard political balancing act for the Democrats right now. 

They don't want to completely trash the tone and decisions of Trump in a moment when the country can't afford outright rancor. 
We need to get along even as we see mistakes being made. 
He so deserves shrill rebuke for his acts till now but it won't be heard well by the public. 

My council for Democrats and all who are watching as we lag in response and wise words from above:

Stay positive. 
Give Americans what they crave right now-
Smart ideas, counter-point to Trump's always odd, uninformed words and flailing. 

State things calmly and show a lot of heart and soul. The tone should be like Roosevelt's fireside chats during the Great Depression. 

And this:
I'd have a group of Democratic leaders and policymakers, and scientists draft a ""We told you so"" document that predicts what will happen in April, May, June as a result of Trump's decisions. Chronicle the recommendations of these thinkers and detail different scenarios - Trump's likely actions vs more reasoned action if Democrats were in charge right now. 
Be specific - from large economic packages to details about procuring medical supplies. 

Then show it if and when Trump blows this as badly as he's been doing and is likely to keep doing. 

Show it ""matter of fact.""

Offer Americans a contrast in style and smarts. In effective government. 

All available to them for a simple vote in November."
2020-03-20 22:00:12,How can pressure be quickly brought to bear in Trump? What if media companies headquartered in CA and NY would suspend all entertainment-related programming for a telethon style emergency program in which leaders and people from all walks of life could call in/Zoom in to make their demands and pleas to use the Defense Production Act until it is done and verified.
2020-03-20 21:00:38,"Trump may not be commanding the manufacturing because it would make him look bad for his earlier downplaying. Trump does not seem to be capable of planning ahead for the shortages that all the experts say are coming.

Yes, we need a government to provide the medical resources to stem the tide of COVID-19. But after the crisis, many people will need treatment for other health problems. Should we not ensure that they have access to what they need to survive? I suspect in a pandemic, everyone realizes that they or someone they know may be vulnerable. When this particular health crisis passes, however, that will still be a reality for many Americans. I hope that more people will realize we need a strong public commitment to protecting the sick, the vulnerable, and the ill--not just in times of national emergency."

Decentralized approaches work best. Just about every country and person has been caught flat-footed given the lightning spread of this unprecedented, fast-spreading and highly-contagious virus.

Dear President Trump:

Although we are both in our seventies, I am a retiree and no longer burdened with employment responsibilities and duties i.e.  officiating other’s concerns and issues.  Let alone a position magnified by serving as The CEO of the largest corporation private or public in the world. Fortunately, “The Defense Production Act” can offer a major relief to you personally and the nation at large via your command authority.

In 80’s and 90’s, I was employed in newspaper circulation management for some of the largest dailies in our nation. On occasions, I made visits to the actual print departments or their manufacturing production units.  Tons of newspapers and advertising circulars were produced on a daily basis throughout the nation. Tissue & other paper products were also produced by the tons by other paper making industries. Therefore, reversing a shortage of ‘sterile’ disposable masks, suits and gowns for health protection and safety seems doable. Further, our military industrial manufacturers make respirators, ventilators, drones, computing equipment, uniforms and beds on a routine basis for defense and war. 

‘Retooling’ production capabilities quickly Mr. President seems like a no brainer. The unanswered questions are from whom and when exactly will desperately needed supplies arrive."
2020-03-20 21:35:49,"But didn't he tell us that he's a Wartime President?  Didn't he tell us that declaring a National Emergency and unleashing the Defense Production Act give him ""tremendous power?""

Is it possible that he's changed his mind?  That he was bluffing?  That he was only saying things to look good for his reelection?  That he lied to us?

Nah, he'd never do anything like that....."

The only detectable longstanding opposition Conservatives still have is to competence and empathy in government..

Opposition to intervention? Please. Trump and Conservatives seem to have no trouble using eminent domain to snap up private land along the border to build a useless wall as just one of many examples.

""Whatever Trump said today"" is not a philosophy, it's sycophancy. 

So let's go to the source:

“When we need something, we’ll order something,” Mr. Trump said of the act. 

In other words, there is NO philosophic issue here  -- Trump just doesn't think we need to place an order yet.  What's the rush?  Perhaps his gut (or Hannity) is still telling him it's a Democratic plot and people are dying just to make him look bad. 

Conservatives politicians should spend less time talking to their stockbrokers about unloading stocks and more time listening to doctors and nurses about how many people are going to die if Trump ""doesn't place an order NOW"""

And yet, there are still large numbers of people gathering and those who are not taking any precautions. If people continue to ignore common sense guidelines maybe we should institute martial law for the good of all citizens.

But it's only an impression, a show designed to look like he's doing something when in fact he refuses to use the Act to deal with the shortages of masks and ventilators, sets a horrible example by acting contrary to the recommendations of public health experts, holds out false hope that a vaccine is just around the corner and says it's really up to state and local leaders to solve the problem.  Meanwhile instead of a coherent plan to deal with a public health crisis killing Americans every day or targeted relief for the millions of workers who are being laid off, we are offered a trillion dollar tax relief cut to save American businesses and pump up the stock market with a pittance for average Americans.  Trump may not be smart but he isn't stupid and the one thing he knows for sure is that he can't afford to lose the election or he is going to jail in New York, if not to a federal prison.  So he will do anything to avoid that, including suspend an election indefinitely it looks like he will lose by declaring martial law.

He should have already activated that and started coordinating which companies were going to be making ventilators, which were going to be making PPE, hospital beds, respirators, saline bags, drugs, the list goes on and on. The point is it is there to centralize the production of needed materials in war time.

Would you care to guess how much money was directed towards healthcare, versus, say, bailing out companies and fighting recession? Strangely enough, even right in the middle of a pandemic, healthcare just isn't a big enough priority for people. We would rather bail out the cruise and airline industries.

Doctors and nurses have the ability to reorganize government priorities rather rapidly. All they have to do is walk off the job and refuse to go back without proper supplies, including masks and everything else they need to keep themselves and their patients safe. If you want to truly put the fear of god into the hearts of the government and the people, you show them a vision of empty hospitals without doctors and nurses, right in the middle of a pandemic. It would be the shortest labor strike in the history of mankind. A new trillion dollar bill would be passed solely for healthcare in less than a day.

So if you are a doctor or a nurse, working in unsafe and inadequate conditions, you can do the easy thing and keep working, like everyone expects and demands you to. Or you can do the hard, courageous thing, and simply walk away. You never swore an oath written in blood under a full moon, pledging to sacrifice your life via suicide by coronavirus. It is just a job. Walk away. Go back only when the value of what you do is recognized."

True leaders set side philosophical or political differences to unite against the common peril. Apparently that's not part of Republican philosophy.

This President has consistently shown that he only cares about those who wear MAGA hats and his rich donors (including those in Russia and other authoritarian states).

But somehow the idea of invoking emergency powers to require corporations to produce ventilators, masks, tests, and other desperately medical supplies is off limits, because of his party's dislike of ""big government""? Please. Why not just admit you care more about the corporations' CEOS and the stock market than you do about nurses having to go without masks and gloves.

That was the attitude of a real leader who followed through and transformed private industry into manufacturers of war materials in an incredibly short time.  The difference is that today's enemy is a lethal virus that threatens everyone and we have a president who seems confused, vacillates and wrings his hands while the pandemic worsens.

Or how they had it covered and it would be over in a couple of weeks, plus the other deplorable comments on how to keep the ""numbers"" down, such as the the cruise ship comment, to NBA players all getting tested first instead of the underprivileged and middle class.

Call them daily.  Inform them that your president is endangering your life and that of your fellow citizens.  He is unfit for office and the 25th Amendment must be invoked.

Make these three calls every day.  Write up a simple list of the names and phone numbers, a sample of your spoken text, and send it to friends and family by e-mail or whatever social media platform you use.

But given the nature of the Republican party, this call looks increasingly like naivete, verging on madness. This is the real source of the generational divide between Democratic voters. Boomers see Gen Z, X, and Millennial Americans as naive ideologues. We see you as the contemporary analog of Neville Chamberlain and his supporters.

When I called my local hospital today and asked if they would like the few N95 masks that I had on hand, the woman with whom I spoke was VERY enthusiastic.

The President has thus far refused to mobilize the federal resources that would add to the supply of this essential equipment to healthcare workers.

The lack of testing and the lack of safety equipment for healthcare workers remain two critical problems that were easily foreseen back in January 2020.

We need competent leadership in the federal government during this crisis that threatens so many American lives.

“According to data compiled by the US Department of Health and Human Services, 95 percent of the surgical masks used in the US and 70 percent of the respirators—thicker, tight-fitting masks that offer better protection against viruses—are made overseas.”

They are almost all made in China. Even the masks which 3M produces are manufactured in China. At the height of China’s COVID-19 outbreak, even the Chinese ran short of masks and respirators.

In this era of outsourcing and “just-in-time” production, we are left helpless when we need crucial healthcare supplies for the American people.

Pointing this out would appeal immensely to Trump’s base. Requiring American companies to begin producing masks here, that were once made overseas, would appeal to Trump’s base. Medical centers are already running out, and the need will become crushing.

Under the Act, Trump could easily order American factories to ramp up to meet our needs. He could hire supply chain managers to quickly sort this out. But Trump does nothing.

Why can’t we plea with huge companies like ford and Chrysler to make ventilators. Construction companies to make make-shift hospitals. Where is our war-time president? Where is the solidarity from American companies to their consumers? Do they feel responsable to the feds or the people who consume their goods. 

Where is the help from all those companies we give our money to? Sports stars could help do this, why don’t they? What use is money if the stuff to buy isn’t there?

The US has had a string of dumb good luck in desperate times with thoughtful effective leaders. Until now. 

As Trump thoughtfully decides how and which big cash corporations can make profits from this, and there is no coordinated central effort to contain it (drove around today in a closed car a bit to look and people are out like it's a normal day), it is becoming too late.

We need the war powers act now, like China's central control, to order people inside. It curtailed it in 60 day. Compare that to Italy which has had 50 + ineffective governments since WWII where the virus is off the charts."

When this is finally under control and hopefully totally over, Biden and (hopefully Warren) will wipe the floor with Trump and Pence as their just desserts, and hopefully, political demise."
2020-03-21 00:46:22,"DJT's shameful and self-serving behavior will never change, but certainly someone within his administration or his GOP cronies should insist that he enact industries to ramp up production for crucial PPE supplies. Oops wrong group to except to respond ethically and morally, good Christians that many claim to be. 
In other countries, industries are voluntarily stepping forward to help, all with a promise of financial bailouts or rewards of deep tax cuts given by DJT. 

Based on stories posted earlier today, grocery store workers, truck drivers, and workers still working to meet the ""essential needs"" of the public must also be protected with masks and gloves. Retailers that refuse to supply these items should be boycotted now and beyond the virus crisis. 
ALL grocery stores should be ordered to provided specific shopping hours open only to seniors and other vulnerable groups. 

Finally, we all need to practice patience and kindness to one another. Rudeness in any form to other shoppers is uncalled for and dehumanizing."
2020-03-21 00:35:47,"At a time of national health emergency, it is important for any country to rally around its leaders and around each other. That means, of course, that the average person whose cooperation is crucial must be able to trust the leaders.

Donald Trump over his three years in office has squandered any credibility he possessed upon taking office. Trump has shown himself to be unprepared, dishonest, corrupt and vindictive on dozens of issues and on hundreds of occasions. 

Nowhere has his evasive incompetence been more apparent than in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The inability to get reliable testing arranged, to obtain and distribute appropriate protective clothing and masks for medical providers, and to prepare in advance for our nation’s hospitals likely being overwhelmed has demonstrated that when the people really needed President Donald J. Trump, he has not been there for us.

With Trump it has always been a day late and a dollar short on anything which would benefit the people, as opposed to something which benefits Trump personally.

May the American people find a way to endure this ordeal which our president has greatly exacerbated by his misconduct."

No, we don't want government to act because that runs counter to our Randian philosophy of limited government, we are told. Ideology has its place but not in policy-making when people's lives are at stake."
2020-03-21 00:35:08,"It seems highly unlikely that Trump will inspire private industry to robustly slog through this crisis of their own initiative and with the required efficiency.  The life-saving medical supplies that are so desperately needed -- one expert estimated an upcoming need of nearly a million ventilators alone -- is staggering in scope.  The entire country should be tested and protected, the sooner the better, so as to avoid overwhelming and breaking our healthcare system and to minimize the death toll."
2020-03-20 23:27:31,"This president continues to actively endanger the lives of millions of Americans through lying constantly, spreading false hope, fomenting baseless rumors about treatments and cures, refusing to take critical action, adamantly exclaiming that he takes no responsibility for anything, pushing the limits on scientific safety, countering public health experts, and behaving like a petulant boor.

Yesterday, the Con-Man-in-Chief dangled the notion that a drug currently used to treat malaria could be a treatment for COVID19.  According to the BBC, today, having heard Trump's claim, numerous people are being treated for overdoses of that very drug because they reasoned that  ""more is better.""

Trump is signing the death sentences of hundreds of thousands if not millions of Americans and he is even having devastating impacts on overseas populations.

Please tell me:  At what point does someone who is an obvious clear and present danger to those around him get taken out of office?  Are their any courageous human beings on the Trump cabinet brave enough to invoke the 25th Amendment?  Clearly not.  Pompeo furthers Trump's favorite racist term for the coronavirus, so we know we can't count on him.

Maybe when their parents, their kids, and THEY start dying, something will happen.  But, I doubt it."
2020-03-20 22:56:36,"Big government? The entire nation is at risk and the White House is acting as if we’re confederacy of 50 countries instead of the United States of America. 

When Trump is personally at risk, he gets to pull out all the stops. When he’s not, well, the whole country can burn. Literally because of fever from infection."
2020-03-21 00:00:33,"So not a moment of debate over bailing out the airline industry that squandered all its boom market profits, or providing cruise lines who purposely incorporate in foreign countries to dodge safety rules and avoid taxes, but help American health care workers well that’s a bridge too far. If we dare do that, now we are asking government to violate the sanctity of private enterprise. There is a plague on this White House and it’s called hypocrisy."
2020-03-20 23:52:28,"Let's be clear: Trump is unable, incapable, of being anything other than who he is. It's our mistake, not his, to depend on him for leadership in this time of crisis. I recall a video clip of a young woman the day after he was ""elected"" screaming ""Not my President."" To be fair, we have seen brief glimpses of Trump being presidential. Brief. It's not within him to be anything other than the charlatan he is. Don't expect more than that."
2020-03-20 23:31:41,"Mr. Trump, you've run out of excuses for an all- out fight to control a stampede of the coronavirus...unless you have some devious intent, or promise to your corporate donors, not to order a conversion of industry's usual products to fill in the needed medical supplies. If you feel too incompetent, move aside, take time off, and allow real patriots to fill the void. It's high time."
2020-03-20 22:28:01,"You never know what he will do.  He does not have a plan...he just talks.  We need a plan, and we need this to start as they are too slow to do this, and I mean the companies that should."
2020-03-20 23:54:59,"Until now, I thought the 25th Amendment solution was hyperbolic, certainly unrealistic.  But this crisis is real, and this man's incompetence has culminated in an ""administration"" that has no clue how to deal with a worldwide crisis, that refuses to respond to reality; a callousness that is jaw-dropping; a demagoguery aimed at campaigning for re-election that will compound the crisis in our country and could realistically lead to serious violence.  

When do those in our government who are still responsible people assess the situation for what it is and remove this fatally incompetent man from office?"
2020-03-21 00:12:16,"No worries, citizens! As we have found out lately about four Congressional Republicans and investors like Carl Icahn participating in Trump's pump-and-dump and insider trading schemes, Trump will ""give into"" pressure to make industry make what we need to survive, just as soon as he finds a way to line the pockets of his business and politician friends. Just give him a few golf days, first."
2020-03-20 22:53:23,"Trump could care less about American families.  GOP senators (including Richard Burr (R-NC) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA)) are just out to use insider info regarding coronavirus threat to protect their personal fortunes by buying/selling stocks.  other like Mitch McConnell are working prop up their big business lobbyists.  None of them could care less about their constituents, who will suffer the most over the next year."

They are actually trying to stand on  ""conservative principles"" when we are on a trajectory to potentially lose millions of American lives to this virus?!  They believe that is actually a viable argument and a noble position?   

They have the mortality projections staring them in the face and yet they STILL seem to be suffering from an utter failure of imagination.    What sort of ""government intervention"" would these advisors think appropriate if we were about to be invaded by a conventional army equipped to slaughter millions of citizens?"

WHY not do what is so obviously, desperately needed? WHY not act to allay the growing panic? WHY refuse to exercise the very kind of presidential power he usually crows about? WHY miss the chance to play hero immediately?"
2020-03-20 23:02:35,"Indicating that the administration doesn’t want to get involved because of its opposition to big government is extremely hypocritical - and a bold faced lie. Trump and members of his administration just don’t want any accountability.

The Trump administration is all about big government, as when they tried to mandate what California could do regarding air quality and mileage standards for cars, or by intruding in people’s private lives by telling women that the government needed to decide what they could do regarding birth control, or by threatening to withhold federal funds from states that supported LGBTQ rights. If that isn’t big government being involved in everyone’s lives I don’t know what is."

2020-03-21 00:40:31,"Donald Trump's failure to use the Defense Production Act is a way to punish places in America that would never vote for him anyway.  Donald Trump is making a calculated bet that if most of the deaths are in blue states he will still get elected in November.  He is calling COVID-19 a war so that Americans will be ""less likely to change leadership"" and give him even more power."
2020-03-20 22:33:43,"I don’t understand the hysteria about not immediately using the Defense Production Act. From reading The NY Times and watching news, it looks like American businesses, especially the medical sector, are quickly adapting to fight this virus. Why would they need to be ordered to do something they are already doing? This seemed like petty, snarky complaints."
2020-03-20 22:31:54,"Donald Trump is showing no mercy towards the parts of America that refuse to support his agenda of white nationalism and totalitarianism.  He is withholding Federal Aid and refusing to use the Defense Production Act.  State and local governments are going to do a heroic job at protecting their citizens during this crisis, but Donald Trump is waging a War...It's just that it's a war on most of America's citizens."
2020-03-20 23:15:00,"The only entity in this country that has the capability to manage this crisis is the federal government. This should be blatantly obvious yet our leadership is acting as though the states and localities should go it alone.
Meanwhile, I, like healthcare providers throughout the country, am caring for patients without access to adequate PPE, waiting days for test results while watching coworkers become ill. Our elected leaders continue to dither.
We need desperately for someone to take charge. We have enormous resources in this country that can be brought to the challenge, but only with direction and coordination. Yes, GM can manufacture ventilators- a simple design with a motor, cylinder, piston and basic electronics would be life-saving. And surely there are hundreds of companies in the US able to produce protective equipment if given designs, materials and a mandate. 
Instead, the President is betting on an ancient antimalarial drug to bail him out of this crisis. Spoiler alert: it's not going to work."
2020-03-20 23:30:23,"Trump isn't going to use the act until he can figure how to make money with it. Perhaps he wants to make sales to China in case they need it during the next pandemic. Actually, no one knows what Trump thinks, about anything, anytime."

Well, sorry Mr Trump, and sorry GOP, wartime means means throwing out the partisan hackery playbook and opening up the spigots on federal funds and federal influence to greasing all the skids necessary to win the war and protect the American people.  Because that's your job- your highest priority as elected and appointed officials.  Start listening to Fed agency's career professionals because they know what they're doing.  You want to be on a wartime footing, great.  Start acting like it and start doing what's needed to protect the American people for crying out loud.  A lot of people are suffering while you dither worrying about shockingly petty concerns."

After all, this was his mantra and the GOP still spouts it...""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help."" Wonder what Bonzo would say ow."
2020-03-21 00:58:49,"So many are stepping up and going above and beyond that it's unacceptable to have a president who isn't and is actually making things worse. Time for him to step aside from the daily updates that he's using to replace his rallies and let NIH or CDC experts give succinct and truthful updates instead. If he won't allow that maybe networks can start putting disclaimers when he has the microphone, or just give air time to the experts. After his deplorable performance today, hopefully the press doesn't retreat but continues to do their job, call out his lies and continue to present him with the facts and hold him to his words."
2020-03-21 00:46:42,"I am in a role providing support for first responders. Sending them out sans PPE is like the early Humvee without the armor.  With few test kits public health is flying blind.

Someone needs to tell the President and his administration that the American people pay their salaries, and that they should serve the public interest or get out. This is what the ideology of ""the right"", aka Republican Party, has always been: anti-government people who have infiltrated government to dismantle it. They lust after tax cuts and de-regulation of Big Business, which plunders the public purse and costs Americans (and Canadians) dearly through inadequate health care, environmental damage and other forms of corporate plunder. We know that when World War II struck, a combination of government and industry mobilized to create a huge increase in ship building virtually overnight. This government can't even mobilize mask making. ""We're not a shipping clerk"", Trump says, and sits on his throne. An absolutely insane situation brought about by a segment of voters who thought it was fun to have a President who lied and shirked responsibility."

He is blundering  through this crisis as if he were wearing a blindfold.   It's apparent that he still  hasn't grasped the severity of this devastating crisis.   In spite of him giving himself a 10, really,  his rating is more like a minus 0.   He's the supposed leader of our country and no, he cannot reject responsibility for his  lack of taking immediate action and play dumb.  With his non-ending contridictions on almost an hourly basis, he's just confusing the few people who listen to him.
All the Governors and Mayors in the country are doing a super job taking care of their people.  I've been listening to

essential civic responsibility. 


Does the ""task force"" headed by pence actually have 
the authority to order equipment of a certain type

procedure to follow? Is it actually happening now? Who is the director of this effort? 

More to the point: what exactly occurs when a state calls in to say we need a certain number of masks and gowns since we
can't find them anywhere?

It's very difficult to make sense of how this nuts and bolts type story is playing out 24/7, but it is essential that journalists dig into the functioning/malfunctioning of the large number of  supply chains to health providers and hospitals.

They have become commercials for his re-election campaign at this point. Stop giving him free air time.

Every time Trump opens his mouth, the stock market sinks. Dr. Fauci is having an increasingly difficult time getting the real story out, with Trump openly contradicting him with word salad.

The only useful thing America is getting out of this is seeing that Trump is increasingly unhinged - not that that is what we want to see.

The Private sector, motivated by private profit, cannot deal with Global problems but treat as economic externalities that someone else has to worry about (e.g. the future, our kids, the poor, the middle class, etc, anybody else.). The Covid 19 virus is part of the greater planetary environmental issues the world faces: global climate change, habitat reduction, extinction, oceanic, land, and air pollution, many more. We must abandon the self-serving and failed notions that every person (alone) is responsible, every nation is responsible only to itself, and humans are above all else and separate--i.e. that nature is a warehouse to exploit for private profit. IN SHORT:
God doesn't sit up nights to admire us (as Twain quipped). We are a compendium species made up of--deposited from--all the lives of others from the past. We have our place but we aren't the be all and end all of 4 billion years of life on Earth. Existence is a co-extensive compendium of nested sets, a vast co-evolutionary interplay of the living and non-living fields of forces. Our lives and beliefs must fit this understanding and create a culture that supports our place of interrelation. WE are traveling on this ship together and need all of us to make the journey."

Why then is it not beautiful that we don’t have anti-SARS-CoV-2 protective masks, gowns, Covid test kits, etc?  Hospital volunteers are sewing makeshift masks for the nurses and doctors, but they are not tested to prevent infection.  Health professionals are now testing positive for Covid and are unable to treat patients.

If this president and his team are just talking every morning and not using their power--Trump can kiss his next term goodbye. If our manufactures are not coming to the rescue--the American people will deal with them when this is all over.  Our governor in Minnesota has been quite frustrated by the foot dragging by the feds.

2020-03-21 03:31:24,"I have posted the following sentiment at greater length yesterday, but I'll try again. Surely not every item of protective equipment requires an advanced high-tech manufacturing facility. Aren't there several types of face masks needed, including the very low-tech paperish bulb with elastic band? The kind that even be made in someone's home?

Millions of senior retired people are stuck at home with nothing to do.  Let the sewing-machine retailers & distributors work with Amazon to deliver loaner machines; others could scare up the materials; and experts could provide online instruction.

He is, without a doubt, personally responsible for the disaster we are living, which will play out for years.   Innocents will suffer and die, families will break down, good institutions and businesses will fail, many will face financial ruin due to Donald John Trump, his cabinet and the GOP Senators led by McConnell.

This is not conservative ideology as a conservative would want to do what is necessary to provide health and welfare for the American people. Rather this is pure inhumane and unpresidential inaction. Perhaps every patient dying due to lack of ventilators should have their estate file a wrongful death action against Trump for failing to exercised his authority to provide medical equipment that would allow them to live. Trump is a clear and present danger to our collective health and welfare."

2020-03-21 02:25:44,"Trump does not want the numbers to go up. He does not understand the real reason for testing, he wont understand or remember if it is explained to him. He won't or can't figure out how to make more equipment available in time. This should surprise no one. Trump makes up his own world all the time. This is fine in a circus, or in theatre, it even passes in real estate,but when reality is needed Trump will not and cannot fill the bill. He lives in his own made up world. 
What to do? Bypass him. Work around him. Ignore him. Do not over publicize him. Pretend he is not there, which is true in a sense. He is an obstruction and needs go be treated as such. For Gods sake do not believe him or count on him when life and death are at stake. This involves knowledge of reality."

Now he finally acknowledges a problem exists, but refuses to take any action to address it until forced into it by the facts on the ground. 

Kinda hard to react to the situation as it will be a month from now when you can’t even remember what you said a day before or consider the consequences of your words and actions a minute from now. 

On top of all this, a clinical inability to show empathy or give hope to the public, unlike Angela Merkel’s stirring speech this week to the German people.

I have taken antiviral meds when I had a needlestick from a infected drug user, exposed  to numerous GI bugs, and the flu over and over, and had it too. All when I was prepared with the right equipment: mask, gown, gloves.
I am not worried about me.  I am worried about my 64 yo husband-who is in the high risk group just by age and sex. 

I go to work now worrying if my job will contribute to my husband getting sick. Will I have the right PPE to protect me so I can protect him?

Please SPEAK UP to your senator, R or D, to make sure every healthcare worker has the right equipment.

Gloves must not have pinhole leaks.  Can’t turn a raincoat factory into a glove plant.

Respirators and masks must meet health and safety criteria.  Shirt factory can’t cut it.

can’t invoke 25th Amendment because the cabinet is all sycophants.

Only immediate option is to fast track impeachment.  Congress is barely doing anything.  The country can’t wait for November to vote him out and mid January to evict him."
2020-03-21 03:15:29,I live in Omaha.  A major medical center here has asked churches and other groups to ask their members to make masks for health care providers.  THEY ARE OUT!  So people are going to fabric stores or Hobby Lobby to get the right fabric and elastic and supplies there are also almost out.  This is the richest country in the world.  THIS IS CRAZY!
2020-03-21 03:17:40,"Perhaps we should state the obvious. Trump is simply over his head in carrying out the duties of president during an unprecedented crisis. As has been observed in a multitude of instances he lacks the management skills, knowledge base, temperament, work ethic and selflessness required at this time.  His one true skill as a propagandist is counterproductive. As long as we tolerate a narcissistic reality show approach (all form, no substance) by a president who is clearly exhibiting rally withdrawal, the country will suffer. We need to figure out workarounds and fast."
2020-03-21 02:58:32,"Perhaps Trump is reticent to embrace these extreme measures because he has been decried as an authoritarian by the media for going on 4 years. Seeing the same people who called him a dictator now complain that he's not dictating enough is kind of ironic. Rest assured that if he was taking the most aggressive measures his perpetual critics would be labeling those actions the beginning of the end of democracy. Don't forget how much the media lost their mind when Trump wanted to have a military parade for gosh sakes. 

These are tough times and leaders are going to be attacked by partisans regardless of what they do. However in ipsos ABC poll released today shows that 55% of Americans approve of his handling of this crisis. That's 12% higher than the approval rating for President Obama's handling of the Ebola crisis. seems to me that most Americans recognize that certain media outlets are always going to find the narrative against this guy regardless of what he does and are just factoring that into the coverage by ignoring a lot of it. It's a transparent attempt to hobble Trump with a Katrina narrative. It's pretty cynical but pretty transparent."
2020-03-21 03:04:48,"These daily press conferences, ostensibly to let the coronavirus task force disseminate information, are turning into a farce.  The President preens and blames, and far too many participants seem obligated to stoke his ego with fulsome praise.  The best thing would be to keep him away from the lectern, or out of the room altogether.

Unfortunately, Trump has realized they can be a venue for him to bask in reflected competence and look ""presidential.""  They are becoming stand-ins for his cancelled campaign rallies.

If President Trump cannot lead, let him get out of the way and allow the remaining competent people in his administration to do their jobs without silly diversions."
2020-03-21 03:09:54,"This seems like a classic case of ""follow the money."" Does anyone know who will profit off of this move?"
2020-03-21 03:35:16,"Trump never hesitates to castigate a business when he has a grudge against it or when it inures to his benefit. He tweets away without a single care. But to save lives - well, that's a wholly different matter."

2020-03-21 02:56:00,"At this point a proxy US president and executive governing body must be created, out of state governors and experts who can direct response and relief efforts using state resources.

I know we are having some difficulty regarding protective gear in some parts of the UK, and they are rushing to provide everything that everyone needs.
Italy had a large shipment of masks and other medical equipment plus medics from China."
2020-03-21 02:33:23,Trump is too caught up in his own rhetoric to understand that he is risking the lives of hundreds or thousands by not using his presidency to fight this pandemic. But he is also tossing away a second term for himself. He cannot cheerlead away the devastating results of his inaction that await our nation.
2020-03-21 02:39:10,"The comparison to WW II industrial response to this pandemic is ridiculous.  Sounds quaint but during WW II the employees weren’t at risk of getting or spreading potentially deadly disease.

This is another one of Trump’s fantasy thinking that is leading this country to multiple disasters."
2020-03-21 03:19:48,"Unfathomable that a debate about the purpose of government should arise during the worst national health crisis in a century, instead of taking action that's actually supportive of the citizens of our country and the medical and scientific professionals who are so selflessly trying to save every life possible.

It is a stance that is arrived at by choice, regardless of the dire consequences that will result, and is essentially state-sponsored and state-approved murder.  Just an ideologically-driven refusal to accept the evidence and act in the best interests of the American people.  Shameful."
2020-03-21 03:24:42,"If Republican members of Congress continue to drag their feet, it's time for their Democratic colleagues to demand, in unison and as loudly and aggressively as they can, that the President issue the order NOW to American corporations to start the presses tomorrow and get those PPEs in production.

2020-03-21 03:16:35,History will note that this is the Herbert Hoover time of the modern era. It won't get any better until Trump is out and another Democrat has to clean up his mess. I shutter to think how many lives will be lost unnecessarily.
2020-03-21 03:29:08,"Trump: “When we need something, we’ll order something”. 

The overwhelming need has been obvious to everyone but you, Mr. President. Governors and mayors and your own scientific and medical advisers have been telling you FOR WEEKS that current stocks of medical supplies and equipment would not be sufficient. 

Now the shortfalls have arrived, all over the country. And STILL you dither and equivocate. 

We need something -- a whole lot of things, in fact. When are you going to do some ordering?"

2020-03-21 02:34:38,"I am reviewing the results from the French study that got Trump excited on the anti-malaria drug.  Mr. Alexander and NYT probably want to review those results also.  It is a small sample size (30 treatment vs. 30 control), but as a scientist I can say that the results are quite impressive."
2020-03-21 02:59:26,"Where are the masks that health workers were promised to come from the Defense Department stock pile?  Dr. Fauci was delighted by the announcement, yet how long will it be to fruition?   Governor Cuomo and the president have been praising each other lately on their actions.  The Governor has ordered  New Yorkers to wear masks in the presence of others by Sunday, as if they were available, and as if they could filter the virus, which they can't, according to the scientists.  Seems to me the politicians are still long on talk and no where on delivery."
2020-03-21 02:38:39,"I would like to hear some facts and details about which state is or isn't able to get what supplies. Trump is literally pitting every state against each other to fight for supplies because Trump doesn't do ""shipping"".  This is exactly why we have a federal government to provide over sight and leadership for times when like this when we need to stream line and expedite critical support. 

Do we also expect 50 different health departments to coordinate and provide the same critical information? No, we have Federal level agencies to provide a single voice and clarity for Public Health. What company would ever operate this way? And I never think of our government as a company because commerce and government are different things with different goals. But still this is not the time to throw the states off on their own. 

There must be some better way to run available supplies and current needs through one clearing house to try to provide to every one what they need. Any good shipping/distribution company would be able to do this. Except we should have done that two months ago. Now? It's just every man, woman, child for themselves???? What kind of society are we?"
2020-03-21 03:52:55,"I’m starting to observe he (Trump) likes this crisis.  It opens up vast possibilities to enrich himself and his donors.  It opens up possibilities to delay or sabotage the November election, more so the longer it persists. It gives him a platform to command national attention and project omniscient power.

Stemming the spread of the virus with long overdue, effective actions like manufacturing essential supplies on wartime footing reduces these possibilities.  It’s within his demonstrated character to be thinking like this. True as well for Jared Kushner, Stephen Miller and the man in the shadows, Steve Bannon.  They’ve shown us who they are."
2020-03-21 03:39:02,Pandemics are like wars and terrorism; they threaten our national security. Americans think nothing of government mobilizing and subsidizing industry to equip our soldiers with weapons to protect us from foreign attacks.   So why on earth can't government do the same for healthcare workers who are bravely fighting to protect Americans from the Coronavirus?
2020-03-21 03:45:10,"The bottom line is that the federal government needs to lead and support the states by helping right now to provide key ventilator equipment, personal protective gear, surge capacity for hospitals, tests, and reagents. 

We need answers about why we are so far behind on getting the above necessary supplies for every state while S. Korea has been testing 15,000 people per day."
2020-03-21 03:53:15,"Let's me get this straight.  These companies will take the tax breaks and subsidies associated with the so-called relief package, but they won't chip in and do their part?

How many companies in the US make respirators?

How many companies in the US make masks?

How many labs do we have?

How many companies make test kits?

My guess it that there are enough companies with full production capabilities, there is just no cooperation, or they have the supplies, they just aren't distributing them.

Can hospital suppliers weigh in here?

When you try to order respirators, tests kits, or masks, what are you told?  Back-ordered? No response?

Please, hospital suppliers, purchasing professionals, please inform NYT readers (so we hear it first-hand) what you are told when you try to order equipment.  We cannot rely on government or media to give the straight facts."
2020-03-21 03:55:03,"I’m currently sewing masks at the request of a pulmonologist and a pediatric nurse who have none.  The pulmonologist managed to find himself a respirator at Home Depot so he could Intubate a patient. 

Homemade masks.  In America.  Wrap your brain around that.  American industry can solve this problem  it need the leadership and reality check to do so.  It’s time."
2020-03-21 04:09:51,Trump resists any kind of real leadership.  He should step down so someone who is a real leader can take over and do what is needed.
2020-03-21 04:12:12,"That the United States cannot manufacture rectangles of a simple textile with any kind of urgency—not to mention not even with weeks of warning—should be a clarion call. Imagine if a real war should break out with China. Those nations that can make things, and make things fast, win wars."
2020-03-21 03:41:19,"Maybe we need to bring some of those who were not able to get treatment due to overcrowded hospitals to the White House and line them up around the capital.  Reporters need to keep pushing Trump to answer for why he isn't enacting Defense Production Act powers when Americans are dying at an alarming rate due to lack of supplies and ventilators.  Keep telling him the ""millions of masks he promised"" have not arrived.  The help he promised has not happened.  Don't back down. Keep pushing.  Maybe republicans will understand when there are no hospital beds nor ventilators left for them and their families when they need it.  Can we charge them with negligent homicide when this is all over?"
2020-03-21 03:47:01,"Medical personnel should not risk their own health, period. If our government can't provide them with the proper protective gear, they should not pay the price of infection."
2020-03-21 03:59:25,"Utterly horrifying that he refuses to authorize this at a time when healthcare workers absolutely need assurance that they will have supplies and be protected. 

I recall the photos and stories coming out from China, just 40 days ago, where doctors and nurses were in full gown, hazmat suits taped immaculately, but still overwhelmed and becoming ill. Stories of them wearing adult diapers because they did not want to remove their PPE to use the restroom and thus contaminate it. Now I see photos of nurses at testing cites with barely a mask on, or gowns flowing in the wind. And reading post after post on Reddit of healthcare workers worrying for their health and safety having to ration masks or downgrade to surgical masks or god forbid bandannas. Why is Trump not seeing this? How many deaths is he now causing?"
2020-03-21 04:22:29,There’s clearly a market for medical supplies to fight the virus. Maybe capitalism really doesn’t work the way it is supposed to work.

But what massively exacerbates matters of having to work the guy who’s in charge"
2020-03-21 04:41:01,"Trump and team is mobilizing new funds, coordination and helps every single day. We went from people not believing this was a threat last Friday to 18,000+ US cases today, 7 days later.  I'm sure that the defense production act will be invoked and medical supplies and coordination are on the front burner. It's just that this thing is happening so fast. Let's set aside politics and come together people. We are all in this together."

I am terrified of not being able to breathe.  I developed panic attacks, which are common in people with childhood asthma, because of my fear of not being able to breathe.  Being put on a ventilator is scarier to me than drowning, because one involves a solid object being forced down my lungs and the other involves liquid flooding my lungs in double pneumonia.  I wish we had a better response to coronavirus.  But I never once thought Trump was the person we should depend on to provide that response.  He simply isn’t capable, and if you don’t know that by now you haven’t paid attention."

Ironic that the draft dodgers are typically the rich, like those dodging any responsibility to do their part to save society are in the private sector.

Another irony is the fact that so called business leaders seem so absorbed with their own financial situation - indeed, ignoring the warning often given to the poor to have 3-6 months of rainy day savings - are ignoring the needs of society and public who are in fact their customers and even shareholders - in 401ks and IRAs. Indeed, without society they cannot exist. And society's health is at stake now.

How much push-back is coming from those who do not want the competition of others rushing in to fill the needs of masks, wipes, ventilators, etc.

The DOD can respond. 

Hypocrisy on steroids? Or orders from Putin to the GOP?  Who knows!  The fact is Trump is not actually, really, doing one thing to help anyone but himself. The GOP Senate is focused on helping the donor class. The House is rendered impotent.

It's disgusting to even have to contemplate, yet these are the logical thoughts that arise after watching a sociopath and his minions try to run the place.

Not just Trump, but the whole political class -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- that made Trump's ascent to power possible, will have to be held to account for this. This is not a democracy. This is not a government that feels any obligation to the people. It is a corrupt and malignant plutocracy that can't even guarantee healthcare to all as a human right in the richest country in human history.

It seems that we will have to fend for ourselves through this crisis. Hiding in our homes, watching loved ones suffer and die as hospitals fail, until eventually it burns itself out.

Somehow there will be an election. In all likelihood it will be a contest between a sundowning shill for the credit card, fossil fuel, and pharmaceutical companies or the incumbent, a widely hated racist and sociopathic narcissist with the good luck to be gifted with an opponent in even worse cognitive shape than himself.

2020-03-21 01:13:39,"Trump will shuck and jive as long as he can, which could be another 10 months.  States will do what they can to get supplies such as masks but we will still be shooting in the dark until we have tests.  And possibly by that time also a vaccine.  

NY has begun testing, and appears to have more cases than any other place merely because they have the test, which means every person who tests positive will be quarantined.  Places which do not have the test are also making people avoid contact.  Obviously, the two situations are different; hopefully in NY people with the virus are forcibly separated, while in other places it is less specific.  

NY could run out of the tests even as other states acquire them, so along with the treatment items the nation needs to focus on creating tests.  Obviously, the Trump admin's 'advisers' and cabinet members do not see this as an emergency.

It all goes back to Trump.  He chooses people for 'loyalty' not excellence.  I would say most of them are 2nd or 3rd rate, but 'loyal'.  The reason everything is happening so slowly is because there is no one to say: ""This is what we need to do and we need to do it now.""  It is criminal negligence.

I hope state governors are communicating to create a unified plan to acquire and administer tests, without expecting much help from the federal government.

The longer we delay the proper protocol for examination and treatment, the closer we are for hitting the tipping point.  We need for the federal government to authorize all medical facilities, such as the VA hospitals and clinics, to engage in services urgently for everyone who has been infected by this disease. Trump must also dictate that the production of needed medical equipment to stop the spread of this disease and to examine and treat it will go forward under the Wartime Law to do so."
2020-03-21 09:04:14,"The President's hesitancy would be more understandable if we believed he knew how supply chains worked and what the status of available supplies is. Right now it seems no one in national leadership knows how many test kits, masks, ventilators and other necessary items are in the hands of hospitals or in the pipeline. Or even how many are needed vs existing stocks. That's legitimate cause for concern and a necessary condition for making any kind of informed decision."

And, of course, not just the provider, because each of us is both a potential vector and victim.  It is painful to feel such anger and contempt, but it really isn’t about Trump or any of the perfectly capable Democrats who ran—it isn’t Trump against Biden or Bernie or Elizabeth—it is an utterly entrenched Republican Reactionary movement against the people and the government that is supposed to represent us. I can’t help but feel that the legacy of slavery runs through this—the sense that business owes nothing to employees or the environment (natural and urban)."

Hence, the unhinged attack on a White House reporter today.  Trump doesn't know and doesn't care about soothing American fears because he only cares about money, power, and praise.

Or is it to let thousands die because they don't care? Or is it to let thousands die because they have no idea what they are doing? Or is it to let thousands die because Putin said so? Or is it a combination?

So he's not sure if the Defense Production Act has been done before. The President, with all his advisers, in a pandemic, isn't sure it's been invoked before, yet he perceives it as a big step.

Have his advisers neglected to inform him when and how the act was used, or can Trump not remember what he is told?

Surely is told daily, by phone, in person, and on TV, of the desperation our medical professionals have without personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep themselves healthy and prevent cross-contaminating patients.

1) How many deaths will it take for Trump to see this as a ""need"" that ""we"" have?

2) Which companies in the U.S. manufacture the PPE and ventilators?

3) What are the masks made of—paper? cloth? man-made fiber? I assume ventilators are metal, plastic, rubber…

4) Ford, GM and Boeing are already not making cars or 737s (nor is the public rushing out to buy them). What must be done to reroute these substances to facilities that need them, or have the ventilator and mask companies build assembly lines in those factories?

5) In addition to maps and charts of how fast the virus is spreading, I want maps and charts of the supply/demand gap for PPE and ventilators.

Remember this next time Republicans tell us we need a businessman as president."

Unfortunately, neither he nor his administration nor, apparently most of the GOP (think Barr)  understands leadership and power means responsibility.  I just can't wrap my mind around how stupid he is.  I am so sad for everyone who is sick and cannot get tested, knows sick people or is fearful of what will happen to them if they become sick.  This is hard to say, but he is worse than Bush2 and much, much more stupid.  I had a hard time watching our servicemen die and the mideast be torn apart during the Bush years, and now to watch this tragedy unfolding at home is difficult.

- How many units are in the pipeline, for delivery within what timeframe?

That’s all this is about, I think ... all the dithering, the prevarication, all the clueless bumbling in the federal government’s coronavirus response is due to the fact that - after denying its threat to calm the markets - now, a few unscrupulous people want to make money off this crisis they’ve only so recently acknowledged.

First, they had to figure out what the hot new product was gonna be - PPE - and now they’re fighting over who gets the exclusive rights to profit from producing and selling this stuff.  This stuff takes time, people.  Doctors, sorry, but you’ll have to wait for your masks ...

This is when Big Government is a good thing.  We need a tough federal government that knows exactly what supplies people need, and has the power to coerce industry to produce the needed products while reimbursing the company for materials and labor costs only.  Profits might be nice but they have no legitimate place in a crisis like this.

Unfortunately, the Republicans will continue to normalize Trump and not do anything about our corrupt, incompetent, illegitimate president.  We have a corrupt Congress representing oligarchs instead of the majority of Americans. Congress does not have the courage or patriotism to act in America's interest instead of their self interest. Even if we can survive until the election in November, it is likely that Trump and Putin will rig the election again.  We have no political solution in sight. The House of Representatives' impeachment was thwarted by the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump remains unchecked. Even if Trump loses the 2020 election, Trump might not leave the office. Before this even happens, we need a military coup by some of the true American patriots in our Armed Services who can oust the entire Trump administration and call for early elections. We need to reverse the stain of the Trump/Putin rigged election of 2016 and Trump's existential threat to America."

It as getting harder and harder to believe that the failure to, at minimum, provide PPE's for the people on the front lines of the battle stems from sheer incompetence; as the days go by and the bodies pile up, it is harder and harder to deny that some element of malice is also at work.

Trump is only interested in strutting campaign style in front of the cameras and mics, touting his nonexistent brilliance about Corona and ventilators and masks and such, basic things, desperately needed in the front of a pandemic not somewhere haphazardly down the road when taking dead bodies off the street might be their next vital job.  Insisting, stubbornly and cravenly, on calling it the ""China virus"" as Asians are beginning to be physically harmed and threatened by Trump's unhinged wing of supporters.

We must accelerate production of proper PPE-we are already missing So many components of crucial safety gear at my hospital in SF-and we are following unreasonably paltry safety practices due to the CDC’s downgrading of PPE standards (because of the current, woefully inadequate supply chain). Delivery, of x millions of masks to the USA is a temporary help, but, in order to achieve maximal & optimal PPE, we need a replenishing source-not just from stockpiles. 

Let’s fix the problem by letting anyone in manufacturing, who can help, help—now, with the actual activation of the DPA.  I’m worried sick for all my coworkers at the hospital (& at all hospitals across America).  To let frontline staff wear only simple masks or homemade Bandanas in exchange for corporate connections is criminal and reckless.  

How can we convince them to do the right thing? The DPA’s stimulation of PPE production will not only save the lives of healthcare staff, it will help us work safely to combat the virus, & it will also serve to stimulate the economy, by getting factories/jobs going again.  I don’t get it-I’m beyond angry and anxious, and while I’m a nurse, all I want to do right now is go work in a factory to make these needed supplies."

The Republicans are putting Conservative non intervention ideology over science and public health epidemiological modelling. Remember that in November.

The only principles conservatives have demonstrated any belief in are Social Darwinism and Laissez Faire Crony Capitalism.

The author is being far to kind in likening Trump's handling of the pandemic to Hoover's handling of the great depression.   What Trump is doing is far more egregious and the closest historical analogy is to Charles Trevelyan, who was in charge of the British administration of government relief to Ireland during the potato famine and infamously limited the Government's food aid programme because of a firm belief in laissez-faire.  That ""principled"" negligence resulted in over a million needless deaths from starvation.

One thing is abundantly clear. donald trump is NOT up to the task of leading this country. He neither has the intelligence, aptitude, attention span nor compassion to dig us out. He is outmatched by the severity of the problem and is making a complete buffoon out of himself. Meanwhile, scores of people will suffer the ultimate consequence of his fake bravado.

This pandemic has made clear that biological weapons could be far more lethal than a limited nuclear engagement between belligerent neighbors, and bio-weapons are likely far easier and less costly to produce than atomic bombs.

Accordingly an order to massively ramp up ventilator production would serve not only this and future pandemics, but also make sense as part of any nation!s defense capabilities against pathogens that cause respiratory crisis or failure.  

This makes Trump’s abject failure to act even more irresponsible and baffling."

His limited intellectual capacity combined with whatever emotional problem means precarious times are multiplied.  He said today that companies are offering their services and abilities to manufacture protective gear and ventilators, but I don’t believe he has taken any up on their offers, or allowed anyone with that power in his administration to do so, not that they’d think of it.  These are not bright people.  I’m sure some companies are going ahead anyway, contacting state purchasing agents and making deals.  I hope they aren’t gouging these clients, but without Federal guidance there’s no way to tell.  Trump’s doing nothing about testing, for some reason he thinks that’s entirely under control, so the Federal Government appears to be doing nothing to support that effort, which is horrible since that’s the most important element to fighting up from the pandemic as soon as possible.  I have a feeling he has crawled under a rock emotionally and intellectually, is saying stuff, but has no idea what the implications are.  That’s why he really gave the NBC reporter a going over when the guy asked him if he had words of encouragement for a frightened public.

Today Trump lashed out at a reporter who had lobbed him a softball question on addressing the nation's fears. Trump is so narcissistic and has such a fragile ego that everything is about him. We can only interpret his reaction as interpreting the question as attack on himself and holding him responsible for the nation's fears.
The man has a total lack of empathy at a time when that quality in a leader is paramount."
2020-03-21 05:02:29,"Trump perhaps does not want Americans to have wide access to masks, because they would (to him) become an enduring symbol of his own great political failure through an election year.

But, with Trump, nothing simple - like just getting on with the job - happens. It all has to be overlaid with a miasma of bragging, contradiction and frank untruths.

Mr Trump's good friend Boris Johnson has seen how to do it. Say little or nothing. Surround yourself with grave faced scientists and advisers. When questioned say, ""I'll leave that one to the experts..."" It's working. Boris looks at least Prime Ministerial, if not actually presidential.

But Trump's refusal to use his Production Act powers to quickly ramp up ventilator production truly frightens me.  I'm 73.  My lungs are already compromised by years of chronic asthma. If, God forbid, I get the virus and it induces pneumonia, access to a ventilator could very well be the difference between making it or not.

Funny, it didn't bother them a bit to push the government budget in a hole for trillions of dollars for tax relief for the 1%.  Now that the 99% desperately need medical equipment, Trump is invoking wartime laws to produce the equipment, which is a completely unnecessary use of presidential power.  The manufacturers are flooding the White House with ofers to get to work on the medical equipment immediately.  Using the wartime law begs the issue of the so-called GOP ""conservatives"" who want the medical equipment NOT to be provided!  But Trump beat conviction and removal from office. So he is even more unbalanced and grossly inappropriate, issuing orders that are not only unnecessary, but illegal."

He says there just aren't enough masks to go around.  I worry for his safety.

The mask and test shortage is inexcusable.  Persuade or corral private companies to make more, import more, DO SOMETHING!  

Is the US finally accepting test kits from WHO and/or Germany, or are they still insisting everything must be domestic?  Why is this?  Because making a buck is more important than saving lives?

The situation is dire.  From the numbers so far, we know that ~80% will have zero to endurable symptoms.  Around 20% will need to be hospitalized, and death rates are probably 1-2%.  But what happens if there aren't enough hospital beds/ventilators/other equipment/medical staff for the 20% who need it?  Death rates will go up.

• Ford, GM and Boeing are already not making cars or 737s (nor is the public rushing out to buy them). What must be done to reroute these substances to facilities that need them, or have the ventilator and mask companies build assembly lines in those factories?

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. In the name of democracy, let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.

Are There Enough Skilled Medical Workers To Run Ventilators?

March 19, 20205:08 AM ET 

All right. So about 2% of people with the coronavirus are expected to develop respiratory problems so severe they'll need to be put on ventilators. There is a shortage of those ventilators in some European countries, and this is raising fears about shortages here in the United States. And there's another problem that gets less attention - that's the need for medical workers with the skills to run those ventilators.

This is especially important for children- keeping them READING while out of school. The more they/we read, the more we learn [even fiction & poetry] and become more proficient readers.

Another helpful app is KHAN ACADEMY. It’s used by over 40 million students worldwide and in many U.S. schools.

In other words, the advisors are advising Trump to stay out of it so.  They realize his incompetence.  They realize that he will screw things up.

We see how this President, Donald John Trump, who lacks empathy,  uses this dire, terrifying situation we are in,  to brag about himself, to 'look important', to show how big and tough he is by yelling at a reporter. We see this unempathetic President playing golf, going to Mar A Lago, hosting big parties, relaxing. We see this President getting enraged when asked by excellent reporter Peter Alexander to comfort the American people. He became enraged not because it was a fair, softball question meant to give him the opportunity to comfort us all. He became enraged because he felt humiliated because he was asked publicly to do something he cannot do. 

These are all classic signs of  the Narcissistic Personality. This President cannot show empathy because he does not feel it. He has no concern for others, meaning, he has no concern for you or I or any of the millions who will suffer because of his inaction. All he feels is a need to make sure he gets something out of it -- in this case money. Follow the money because that is the only thing that Donald John Trump cares about. 
We American people are experiencing the ultimate con.

His delay, delay, delay strategy was obviously a tactic to slow down the output of numbers of those testing positive, thus making it seem as if his determination early on of the virus being a 'hoax' orchestated by the Democratrs was true. 

And by the way, there's been no word ever coming from this White House informing the citizens of our country how two events that occurred on the other side of the world, one in late January, 2020-the onset of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the other in mid February 18 thru January 24th-In Milan, Italy, it's eagerly anticipated Annual Fashion Week.   

Both events would loose upon the world hundreds of thousands of people infected with the coronavirus, changing life as we knew it, and that being forever.

Trump, just earlier this past week, was still trying to create the impression he had all hands on deck from day one and succeeded in preventing the coronavirus from getting a toehold early on, so unlike Italy who failed miserably.

But now, as testing kits begin to leak out, the numbers of our own testing positive escalating, we know differently. This even as Trump continues to delay, delay, delay, pushing the numbers of those testing positive through the roof.

It will be necessary because if you think for one second that he will allow himself to be removed from the White House you're sadly mistaken.  I'll give you a hint: ""wartime president"".  His words.  And other little things here and there like the ""Chinese"" flue and the assault on the media, and on and on.   If he's not re-elected look for him to discredit the election and remain in office and use the powers granted to a ""wartime president"" to stay in office.  He was going to use war with Iran to achieve this but along came Covid-19 and rescued him from that.  And for God's sake please please, don't argue with me.

Do you really believe our system works?  A person like Trump not only managed to get elected but the nation managed to keep him on top of them like a welcomed calamity.

Capitalism does not work as an ethically viable system.

Mother State is called in for help only when we are in dire straits.  After the disaster is over we cannot wait to push her back to the attic or sub-basement.

We are so stupid that we cannot even see that the only man out there who deserves our vote is a Jew from Brooklyn with an accent that will make my kvetching uncles proud.  

While in isolation may I suggest everyone to read John Rawls’ A Theory of a Justice.  Written in 1971 it should replace out archaic constitution. A true American Patriot, Rawls taught Philosophy at Harvard where he was a University Professor till his death.  He envisioned a society where everyone goes to bed without knowing who they will wake up as and are indifferent to the fact.

Honestly our society is as diametrically opposite to that as it is imaginable.

Bernie Sanders is a Rawlsian, not a socialist or communist.

2020-03-21 16:39:40,WHY IS TRUMP BEING ALLOWED TO NOT INVOKE THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT ON ITS MANDATORY BASIS?  THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS BEGGING FOR SUPPLIES.   WHY IS HE ABLE TO STOP THE SUPPLY?
2020-03-21 16:41:48,"Mr.Trump, if you want to stop journalists from asking you embarrassing questions, the solution is simple.  Just ask the very many companies you say have volunteered and are ramping up to provide the everything the American people need to survive the COVID-19 attack.  Just list the companies, products they will make and first delivery dates.  It's very simple.  If he can't, he must be responsible for more deaths than necessary."
2020-03-20 21:57:55,"This needs to be treated as if America is at war, because it is!  A good part of the nation's economy is shutting down and we're staring at up to 2 million dead.   Meanwhile doctors and nurses lack for PPE, ventilators, and testing kits and supplies.   So basically Trump's fine with frontline troops fighting off a deadly invader without ammunition."

When this mess is over, and perhaps even before, many of these companies will be lining up for bailouts from the same big government they decry now.  It all about who benefits and who pays.  Corporate America maintains the fiction that they are private enterprises, up to the point when the risk they have assumed is beyond their ability to handle.  In reality, their risk is effectively assumed by the American taxpayer.  Whatever happened to ""let the market decide""."

My family is rounding up the few N-95 masks we had lying around for construction purposes for her to use, but I don't know what happens after that.  

The inaction from this administration is beyond incomprehensible and shows a profound failure of anyone in the administration to appreciate the magnitude of the problem we face.  By the time production is ramped up to meet demand, many preventable infections and deaths will have occurred. It is unforgiveable."

This murderous non action must turn around immediately to save innocent lives!"

There is not enough personal protection gear to cover the people who will take care of your loved ones, so staff will be home sick.  Patients as well as staff will suffer.

In our area, a hospital had an order protective gear on the loading dock ready to unpack and it was stolen.  It's serious.

By not acting, the president will have blood on his hands.  I hope it is not mine or yours, or my children's--who both work in health care facilities."
2020-03-20 19:10:24,"This is inexcusable!

The president should stop dragging his feet.  We need masks and ventilators and increased capacity for housing and treating patients.  We need it now and we'll need it for at least the next few months and we need to take action immediately.  Many lives are at stake.

I don't care about anybody's ""longstanding philosophical opposition to big government"".  I also don't think the states should lead on this.  I don't believe that individual states have the capacity to force manufacturers to retool production, and certainly not on the scale we need now.

Nobody likes an intrusive government (liberals included).  But as Angela Merkel made clear in her beautiful address to the German people this week, this is an extraordinary situation and calls for extraordinary measures.  Those measures should be temporary, and focused entirely on controlling the epidemic.  But this is a time of national crisis and for many of our fellow citizens, this will be a matter of life or death."

As an emergency physician I am constantly told that patients exhibiting symptoms do not meet the constantly changing criteria for testing. Patients with fever and cough are told to go home and self quarantine.
Meanwhile asymptomatic celebrities obtain tests. The current crisis, including shortages of personal protective gear such as N95 masks and gloves, lays bare the net result of a healthcare system where profit is allowed to be a motive and universal access is not considered to be a right.
The epidemic may have contributed to the end of Bernie Sanders’ campaign while at the same time vindicating his basic assessments and policy proposals."
2020-03-19 11:28:22,I can't believe that we *still* haven't solved the testing problem. We need to test all symptomatic people and then trace their contacts. There is no other way to stop this disease. We have know this was coming for more than 2 months. Why are there not enough tests?

My God, that's true of the entire country!  And the president's laissez-faire attitude towards who gets these precious tests simply reflects the Great Gatsby attitude that with wealth, comes privilege.

We're seeiing tremendous societal inequities during this crisis, which is also bringing out the worst in many.  I'm thinking in particular of the folks who have made runs on stores, scooping up vital household supplies we all need but now can't get, even online.

It takes a crisis to reveal the character of a nation: those who give versus those who take,  those whose fame and fortune buys them special acces versus those forced to the end of the line."
2020-03-19 11:26:50,"We're at the point where celebrities do nothing essential, so stay home! Don't take a test unless you are truly ill.

Save the tests for first responders, government workers still required to do field work (we still need food inspectors), health care workers, daycare employees, and anyone exhibiting serious illness. Otherwise STAY HOME.

Unfortunately our federal government bungled this so badly we have to ration these tests."
2020-03-19 11:27:00,"Doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, and law enforcement deserve priority in testing.  Period.  Without them you have no Coronavirus response, they are not easily replaceable, and they are the front line. On top of that, if one of them is infected, they are in a position to spread it many other people.

Athletes and celebrities have no reason to leave the house right now.  Healthcare workers and law enforcement don't have much of a choice here."

I live in St. Louis where we've had about 250 tests and about 20 people infected (2 weeks ago we had 1).  I think Missouri would therefore ""qualify"" as one of those states where the virus has been slow to appear.

I can tell you it is not ""easy"" to get a test here.  My daughter is a healthcare provider and provides Emergency Services to patients without the benefit of any N95 protection (another issue).   She has the symptoms but can't get a test because she hasn't had contact with a confirmed case  (again 200 tests given today in Missouri and 20 cases total) or someone who has traveled to an infected region.  Instead she's told to self-quarantine for 14 days. 

The testing problem is a problem everywhere."

2020-03-19 11:25:10,"It is an age-old situation.  Part of me is of a mind that if I had the means, I (and the household) would test if I or immediate family were exhibiting symptoms.  More complete testing helps to contain the spread.  This has already been shown.

And part of me says wait until necessary. But what is clear is that social distancing works and testing isn’t urgently needed unless you are ill and practicing good social distancing.

The real problem is that we have a President that consciously and ignorantly hobbled our ability to protect ourselves by multiple means.  Otherwise, these ethical and moral questions would be far less problematic.

The existential question now is - is it ethical and moral to keep Trump as our President while showing such inability to lead?  Would you keep a CDC Director or NIH Director that exhibited such poor decision-making?  I wouldn’t."
2020-03-19 11:36:17,"The idea that the wealthy can obtain a medical test in a pandemic that the ordinary person cannot comes straight out of some dystopian Hollywood movie.  It is an obscenity.

The doctors and labs who are giving preferential treatment to the professional athletes and superstar models looking for the tests should turn these people away.  And if they do not, they need to be exposed so the world can know what they are doing.  First offense, a heavy fine; second offense, take away their license to practice.  That'll wake them up. #InequalityStinks"

But, for decades now, we have lived in an oligarchy. Sanders is merely running to help the brainwashed masses deal with the destructive result of this gilded age, exacerbated by Obama/Biden, not because he desires more of either for himself."

2020-03-19 11:40:08,"In the short term, let’s hope as many of these elites die as possible. Why? Because along with mass mobilization warfare, violent revolutions, and total state collapse, pandemics have been a historically reliable leveler of gross inequalities. 

If many of them don’t die by pandemic, in the long term my hope is that this particular case of obscenity leads more people to sharpen their proverbial pitchforks. That way we can push harder for number 2 or at least lean a bit more towards number 1 via continued populist, nationalist, and anti-globalist policies and politicians. 

And here’s where the debate over what to call this disease, and the fact that elites are getting tested first, intersect and expose their aims. They don’t want us to hold China accountable for spreading this through lies, because they profit over their relationships with that dictatorship and it’s slave labor. And they don’t want to actually make any personal sacrifices for this relationship either, hence their efforts to save themselves and let us go untested. 

In other words, our elites at this point are a purely parasitical element. They are as toxic and life threatening as this virus and possibly more so. While I will personally continue to put faith in populist, nationalist, anti-globalist politicians - even craven tools like Trump - it may eventually become necessary to eliminate these elites as vigilantly as we’ll work towards eliminating the virus. 

Leveling is often harsh. Deal with it."

What they should be doing, instead of scurrying to get tested ahead of everyone else, i.e. people who are actually out there doing something to stop this pandemic, is do something themselves. Volunteer at a hospital, go out and get ventilators, get groceries for someone who is self-quarantined. They have absolutely no idea how real people exist in the real world, and honestly, I wish I never had to hear an athlete tell us he/she is thanking God, or taking it one day at a time, or hear some dumb actor wax poetic about, well, anything.. Plus the way they treat their aides is beyond despicable, it's criminal. I've actually begun to get a little suspicious about people like Mike Pence and Anthony Fauci saying they haven't been tested. Really? Could it be that they're trying to spin the narrative once more and tell people not to get tested if they show no symptoms? Is it because all the test kits are being reserved for the elite?

The media needs to wake up and stop ruining the economy by perpetuating the distortion and throwing everyone into a panic. The most contagious people are not permitted to get tested. Just say it already. Half the people I know, including myself, have very mild symptoms, not enough to get tested per the CDC criteria. The symptoms align with mild walking pneumonia basically.

Those that rant about the corrosive effect of social programs (Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, WIC, etc) change their tune when their investments falter. Providing food, shelter and medical care to all is abhorrent when it threatens the bottom line. Got to stay economically competitive.

Senator Sanders was pilloried for his extravagant programs—the cost and who pays. Now, the trillion dollar bailout, which will enrich the wealthy more than the hourly wage earner, is now getting flaccid reception by some on Wall Street as not enough $.

Class warfare. This sanctimoniousness cry only flows one way—when those on top feel threaten. “To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.”

This pandemic will pass. But all the PR will not erase the fact that we are not “all together in this.”"

2020-03-19 12:10:36,"Expand testing, now.

South Korea has more than proved that only by widespread testing and social tracing is the virus contained quickly.

Why we still do not have sufficient tests and the capacity to use them an treat the results accordingly is a scandal.

Ironically - remember those ""death squads"" that the opposition to Obamacare feared?  They are here as decisions are made as to whom to test. How many are we consigning to an agonizing death because of our inability to test and to treat?"

2020-03-19 12:12:07,"So, when a small group, like an NBA team or congress, is tested thoroughly, the number of positive results is much higher than the reported number for the general population, which is about 29 per million. This means it's probably very widespread, and we just haven't confirmed it yet."
2020-03-19 12:06:59,"The country and the world will bounce back from this pandemic.

Us boomers had a good run. What an incredible time of transition it was. As we drop off the caravan and the party moves on without us maybe a better world will open up."

They are the priority for protection and testing.

I’ve been wondering if we should pull them back (i.e. close hospitals now) until they can be protected and tested. I know what I’m proposing, I’m not sick (if I am it’s mild) and nobody I know is either. I have no power or influence, so there isn’t a chance of what I’m saying becoming reality..."
2020-03-19 12:17:53,"It is interesting to me that so many people are complaining that the rich and famous and other elites are getting preferential treatment during this pandemic. At the same time, they are going to the polls and voting for Joe Biden, a strong member of the establishment, who promises to bring back the status quo we had before Trump. The elite being at the head of the line for everything is the status quo. Judging by their votes, it seems that most Americans seem perfectly happy with our unequal society."

2020-03-19 12:26:13,"Not being tested is just an annoyance. The real issue is going to be access to scarce ventilators, which will be a life or death decision that someone will be making. 

We need laws, probably state level, setting out the process and guaranteeing that the criteria will not include wealth and connections.  

Lottery?
Scoring system, based on age, dependents, other health conditions? I’m not going to play God, but someone is going to."
2020-03-19 12:23:05,"Up to now, the yearly 40,000 deaths and 500,000 bankruptcies from our healthcare system seemed very remote to the well-insured, generally healthy and financially comfortable (but not terribly wealthy). 

There was no urgency to make dramatic improvement to the system because the impacts were always very distant and happening to other people. The risks of change always seemed too great because the status quo worked for enough people, no matter how many it failed.

Now every non-wealthy American is about to face a brutal lesson in what it’s like to be on the losing side of healthcare. Which is probably why politicians have floated the general idea of covering this one specific condition for free (but nothing else - a system of healthcare winners and losers must be maintained), without accepting the kind of fear and dread everyone is feeling today is what tens of millions of their vulnerable fellow Americans have faced their whole lives."
2020-03-19 12:24:16,"Who is surprised by this? Elites should be ashamed to have any public knowledge of their testing. They donate in cases of natural disasters, proudly attaching their names to cash gifts. Surely many donations are made in good faith, not just to boost their image. But anyone who preens on the red carpet during awards season should be the first to give up a huge chunk of money to help in the crisis. 

During wartime, celebrities did their part to help - joining up, fighting in combat, entertaining troops overseas in USO shows, and helping at the Stage Door Canteen on Broadway. It was a civic duty, and they heeded the call. 

Today’s elite? Not to generalize, but the majority would rather bask in their privilege than contribute without an Instagram story showing how “selfless” they are."
2020-03-19 12:25:12,"My 12 year old daughter has been sick for over a week... we did teledoc Saturday and she has only gotten more sick since then. Coughing so much to where she’s throwing up, has had a sore throat, ear pain, headaches, and has lost 6 pounds. Yesterday I took her to the pediatrician. The pediatrician said she would have her tested but she does not meet the algorithm for what the CDC requires (no fever that I have captured, however children have tested positive without a fever). In the meantime I am a healthcare worker and am expected work with my elderly, already compromised, patients.. unknowingly could be carrying it myself and exposing my patients. The state of Indiana has tested fewer than 200 people!?! Why is this?! Why can the elite (without any symptoms) get tested but my little girl can’t!?!?!"
2020-03-19 12:20:50,"Ah, the NBA. Patrick Ewing famously said, ""People complain that pro athletes make a lot of money, but what they don't understand is that we need a lot of money because we spend a lot of money.""  I am guessing that most NBA players spent more on tattoos I did on my home mortgage, bless their hearts."
2020-03-19 12:19:53,"We forget, a week ago Trump and Pence had the test available to everybody that wanted it. 
The non rich just weren’t lining up."
2020-03-19 12:24:35,"Someone explain to me why, at this point, we don't have hundreds of thousands or millions of tests every day. At the beginning of this crisis the CDC set the standard for those that should be tested but it quickly became clear that those standards were to restrictive. We've all heard about people who had symptoms but we're denied a test. Our government needs to work with public and private sectors to produce and distribute tests nation wide so we can know where we stand today with the spread of this virus. Call your state and federal representatives and ask what they have done today to help us understand where we are now in this outbreak and when we and our neighbors can get tested. Knowledge is power."
2020-03-19 12:35:49,"My husband is a pediatrician and his coworker's child has tested positive, both parents are physicians, one of which works in a prominent hospital treating coronavirus patients.  It took days with begging and pleading for both parents to be tested last week in order to protect not themselves, but their patients and coworkers.  One finally received results and tested positive and the other is still waiting for results.  Both have self quarantined since their child fell ill.  My point is that once the healthcare providers have to start quarantining, the system will not only lack masks, ventilators and beds but also the people we rely on to treat us.  In addition, these men and women on the frontline should be given access and priority  to prevent the spread amongst themselves and their patients (as well as their family members).

So for all the celebrities, sports players and politicians that find a way to magically get a test, please consider the people who do not have the luxury to stay home and be with their families during this uneasy time."
2020-03-19 12:17:37,"This article COMPLETELY FAILS to mention that President Trump said  the first week of March that Anyone Who Wants a Coronavirus Test Can Have One. Had you considered that perhaps people were relying on the president’s LIE to American citizens?!

You guys -NYT- need to be better communicators and instead of headlines like this on March 7: Anyone Who Wants a Coronavirus Test Can Have One, Trump Says. Not Quite, Says His Administration.

Communicate clearly like this: President Trump Lied. There Are NOT Enough Coronavirus Test Kits in the U.S.A. For Everyone, In Fact, Very Few Are Available And They Are Being Rationed."
2020-03-19 12:43:01,Our healthcare system is built on the idea that the wealthy and connected receive superior care. It is a horrifying reality but it is frankly bewildering that anyone is surprised to see it operating as designed.
2020-03-19 12:43:37,And the fact that celebrities and the well connected were able to get tested regardless of whether or not they exhibited symptoms should surprise exactly no one.
2020-03-19 12:43:48,"The shortage in tests and the disparity in access in unacceptable. But I would like to point out that in the early days of this, headlines of celebrities testing positive might have made a difference in raising public alarm. It wasn’t until Tom Hanks, NBA players, and other recognizable figures (yes, some without symptoms) started testing positive that it began to settle in that the virus is already everywhere, and we should all stay home even if healthy."
2020-03-19 12:28:56,This would not be an issue if the Trump Administration had got ahead of the testing issue instead of treating the virus as a PR issue where the objective was to tamp down the numbers.
2020-03-19 12:28:57,"“You’d have to ask them that question”. Mr. Trump, of course, continues to know nothing, he claims, shrugging off both the limited number of tests available and the access processes.
The follow-up I'd like to have heard him asked is, ""Why did the US decline the offer of WHO test kits in the first place?"" I believe the president should be asked at every press availability to explain how he allowed the testing to lag so far behind the problem. How he allowed his administration to so fail the public."
2020-03-19 12:29:23,I wonder how many politicians have put themselves with their self importance and elite status ahead of the elderly and sick.?
2020-03-19 12:32:30,"Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson were not only tested but treated in an Australian hospital, despite having mild symptoms. Any Australian citizen would be told to sit at home with far worse symptoms ... and wouldn't be tested."
2020-03-19 12:35:10,Where are the tests? Our government has bungled this in an epic way. They are all too busy trying to rescue the economy instead of doing everything possible to save American lives.
2020-03-19 12:36:02,"There are about 1 million hospital beds in the US, but some are not in facilities capable of acute care.

There are 1.1 million doctors in the US.  Most have living spouses, children and parents.  Their nuclear family total is probably at 4-5 million.  Even in normal times, doctors always give special consideration to medical care for each other.

There are a lot of powerful politicians at local, regional, and federal level.  They all have families.

There are a lot of very well connected wealthy and/or celebrities.  They all have families.

When the medical care system becomes overwhelmed, do you really think you will even have access to a hospital if you are not a doctor's family, a politician's family, or a celebrity's family?"
2020-03-19 12:40:43,How did the Koreans manage to test so many people? Isn't that how they contained the virus?

2020-03-19 12:32:19,"Why is everyone so surprised by Rich Man's Health Plan ?  We have been exposed to Rich Man's Justice for so long, it no longer phases us. Let's look at this another way. More than likely the doctors that treat these Athletes and Stars realized that this virus was going to come here and prepared for the worst case scenario and preordered test kits.  The moment this current administration downplayed the threat we all should have begun preparing for the threat."
2020-03-19 12:33:01,"Is anyone surprised that those with access to wealth and privilege can get better care via private doctors? But maintaining this deeply unequal system deprives the vast majority of Americans basic rights and cripples the government's ability to respond as they should, with consistency, alacrity and coordination. It only serves the wealthy and the insurance industry. Maybe this pandemic will help people realize that our privatized, profit first health care system is completely unable to handle a public health crisis because it is not geared toward the public interest. Time for Medicare for all."
2020-03-19 12:33:07,"The politicians are another form of celebrities who can get access to these tests ASAP. Not not just focus on sports celebrities but Matt Gatez, Ted Cruz and several other politicians who were able to get testing right away.  These are the people responsible for the unpreparedness and our dysfunctional health care system.  They should have to wait in line like the rest of us."
2020-03-19 12:33:08,"International evidence indicates that Coronavirus is being spread by people who are asymptomatic.
We need Free, Universal Coronovirus Tests for everyone in the country, immediately.

Most locations in America are probably mostly free of Coronavirus, but we will never know unless we test.
Trump’s stubborn refusal to prepare for widescale testing, when the first US patients were found in January, was the single most dangerous (in)action in recent American history."
2020-03-19 12:06:40,"This is disgusting,  capitalism at its worst,  when the ill need medical support and empathy.   The wealthy should be donating money to set up food donations,  and financial support to those in need."

The rest of us will be thrown a few pennies in the form of checks that we can run after to keep us distracted while we hear stories about the rich and famous riding out the storm. This will not be tolerated and chaos will ensue. Other countries, less infatuated by their dreams, will wonder in amazement as we destroy ourselves."

The NYTimes was for atime attacking Trump for misfeasance.
It was not Trump: it was the CDC and FDA, who advise him,
and escecially the CDC which did not go all-out having private 
firms start making tests, even of their own divising, right at day zero. 

This is bureaucracy in action, and the final death gasp of the
arguments for a single, all-powerful and dictatorial, Federal
health care system. Remember that the CDC actually refused allowing people in Washington state who could test, to test.

Soon we will be finding out that people died because yes, the drugs used in South Korea work, but the CDC and FDA refused
to allow them to be tried here with the same speed.

Articles like this are a big part of the problem, remember the

Zeynep Tufekci wrote about the mistrust these mixed messages breed earlier this week regarding face masks and now with the continued government misinformation machine continuing to do this with testing availability, test eligibility criteria, and most recently these medical ships with ventilators being deployed has me wondering if this is more than incompetences and maybe a little on purpose? 

I hope we as a society continue to think critically about what's really important.

No. Testing everyone (not the rich and famous) helps us all by identifying where the worst community spread is, by identifying clusters of asymptomatic spreaders and super spreaders, and by then enforcing mandatory quarantines for the asymptomatic, who are still shedding the virus onto surfaces and into the air wherever they go. The virus is airborne (lasting 3 hours in the air you walk through and breath) and it remains on surfaces for days to weeks. It’s highly highly contagious. Testing everyone (especially the poor) matters and it is our first line of defense AND best hope to flatten the curve."

- Receive a written order for COVID-19 testing from a licensed healthcare provider; then

- Make an appointment with a testing site before visiting the testing site.

I repeatedly called UCs, doctors, hospitals, the Ny state health line and CDC, asking about testing.  All told me if I hadn’t been to China or Iran, they wouldn’t test me. None of them even old me to stay at home (remember, this was a month ago)!

After about two weeks, I finally felt better, breathing normally resumed, etc., but this was only two weeks ago!

Comments on sports sites routinely complain about these men as being pampered, spoiled, paid for playing a kids game, etc. with a level of vitriol seldom found elsewhere — not even for NBA team owners or athletes in other sports, or of other ethnicities. It’s one of the sports with the most persistent metaphors from slavery (I wonder if pre-integration baseball do consistently talked about players being “on the trading block,” as “beasts,” and so on). It’s the old trope of successful black people bring called uppity and drawing the ire of white people with less means. 

You may not buy my argument, or think it’s unnecessarily looking at race, but time will tell. in 20 years I think it will be obvious how racialized, biased, and focused on a white/black binary this talk around black people in sports was back in 2020. So to put it the black and white terms of our time: in n the future the New York Times choosing an image of black basketball players and not, say, white members of congress, to illustrate privileged access to Covid-19 testing will be seen as part of the problem."

There are two very different models on how to approach Corona.  We now can see the Northern Italy experience and also evaluate the Asian experience (China and South Korea).  The key: tests, tests, tests and then more tests.  Lockdowns may slow Corona, but lockdowns do not tell you who carries the virus.  Test everybody!  You can then isolate virus carriers.  When someone tests positive to Corona, but does not need to be hospitalized, do NOT send them home to self-isolate.  They inflect everybody else in the home.  Look at N. Italy.  New death records are being set daily!  The virus is not being isolated, it is being sent home to infect others.  Compare to Asian model.  Lots of tests, then positive testing patients are isolated and quarantined.  China now has days without any new cases reported.  Deaths way down.  New cases and deaths also much lower in Korea.  Test and then isolate virus looks like the path to fewer cases and deaths.  I really, really hope that I am wrong in the following, but it does seem clear that the failure of leadership in USA in getting out massive number of tests early is about to lead to many deaths.  I am not guessing, just look at Italy.  Tide can be turned some by getting out the tests…….now!"

- Receive a written order for COVID-19 testing from a licensed healthcare provider; then

- Make an appointment with a testing site before visiting the testing site.

- When you arrive at the testing site, make sure you bring all necessary ID and documentation to get tested.

Furthermore, how many more months will it take trump to:

-use Defense Production Act to have factories produce necessary health protection equipment, test kits, and anything else to test folks, treat folks, and limit the spread of the virus?

Why should people have full health care coverage like Europe, paid leave ? pre-school,  everyone scoffed at that, Andrew Yang talked about giving everyone 1k to keep communities afloat, everyone scoffed at that.

Now we are in a melt down and Wall Street short term sellers are making money off the backs of regular citizens instead of shutting  Wall Street down so the 401k's aren't completely destroyed .

Everyone rich will be taken care of, their private drs, hospital connections, plenty of food, the list of happiness for rich people is endless. 

The rest of us have to make do with the left overs and that is just the way it is.  Another bail out for the airlines, they spent all their money up with the stock buyback they engaged in with the Trump tax package.

At this point the regular public doesn't have enough testing kits because of our ignorant politicians, so we have great medical staff and now they must be like Jesus turning water into wine"

Now, the world and medical records are computerized.  Setting up drive-thru or walk up testing sites (or mail-in testing, like genetic testing) should have started in January.  What is the delay?

The gov't's response is not proactive, it has been reactive and we are shutting down the country when less than 1 percent have been tested, and less than 1,000 have tested positive in a population of more than 300,000,000.

The government and media keeps scarring us with the word pandemic, but we don't even have pandemic numbers.

Where are the 24/7 labs?

Here is the first reality:  our country has a pathetic number of test kits at its disposal.  This failure can be traced directly to Trump, who pooh-poohed the seriousness of Covid-19 and slow-walked getting enough test kits because the fewer people you test, the fewer infections you'll find, and the easier it becomes to prop up the stock market with happy talk and influence people to go out and spend money.  We need to have people working 24/7 to manufacture test kits, make them available TO ALL for free, and test everybody early and often.  But remember, just because you tested positive once doesn't mean you won't get Covid-19, particularly if you don't practice social distancing on a continuous basis and wash your hands properly.  And that goes for the NBA.

Here is the second reality: millions of Americans (particularly the young and coddled) will not practice social distancing.  This behavior will continue to endanger the rest of us.

Here is the third reality: masks have value because they help remind us not to touch our facial mucosa (mouth, nose, eyes), and they reduce the spread of virus in the air and on surfaces.  However, as with test kits and ventilators, our country has a grossly insufficient supply of masks, due to outright lies by the administration about the efficacy of masks in order to cover up the fact that supplies of masks are pathetically low."

Forget the hospital ships, forget the masks, what the country and the world needs is test kits. The scarcity of test kits is the crux of the problem. If everyone was tested on a regualr bases we would then know who was infected, now we don’t. Everyone should be tested, at least once a week, and in a month this whole thing would be over. Right now, with everyone quarantined, everyone is assumed to be infected, this is a Dickensian remedy, even dystopian. We can’t cure a problem if you don’t know where it is. Test kits, test kits, test kits."

It is unfair that well connected people can get a test when regular people can't with the same symptoms.

But finding some non-symptomatic infected people is a good thing. They are likely to contaminate more people than symptomatic people staying put. 

A silver lining in this is the reporting of a number of case with are not symptomatic and may have had no known exposure to the virus. It should make anyone reconsider having even small gathering until this blows over. 

More testing would reduce the need to isolate everyone at a huge societal cost. I wished we also had antibody detection based test to also figure who was sick and recovered. 

May be we are at a point where we give up on contact tracing in the US and just hoping strong isolation for 30 + days will stall the virus momentum. There was another far less costly to society way to control this like in HK, TW, the US blew it."

As a 73 year old I must say this is the only reasonable thing I’ve read in this article. From a selfish point of view, if you’re sick with only mild symptoms, what difference does getting tested do? You’re going to treat a cold and the virus the same way. From an altruistic point of view it does make a difference. If you have the virus and self-quarantine, you will keep it from spreading.

If you can catch a potentially Pandemic before it leaves its country of Origin, and suspend ALL international travel for that country, wouldn't that be guaranteed to limit it to that country?"

Politicians, celebrities, and athletes are in the category of people who have contact with multiple people. We can add teachers, store clerks, restaurant workers and bartenders to that group. We absolutely need to test healthcare workers who have intimate contact with those who are most vulnerable: probably should have been tested first. After we have tested the above, we should look into testing anyone with symptoms before testing the general asymptomatic public. I am not going to make a value judgement on who is more important based on testing but we need to test as many people as we can to understand the extent of this virus, to understand the transmission properties of this virus, and to understand how and when we should modify our containment efforts. It isn't about who is more important but it IS about who has the potential to spread this very contagious virus."

Why did the US govt turn it down and rely solely on the CDC to create a new test kit?  Is it because Trump doesn't like international organizations?  

We know that countries like South Korea did a great job fighting the spread of the coronavirus with lots of testing.  Why is it so hard for Americans with fever and coughs to get tested for the coronavirus?"
2020-03-19 14:56:00,"I agree, anybody with the slightest risk of contact should have access to testing. We need the data for rational strategies of ""mitigation"". Unfortunately, it appears this will not happen in the near future.
In the mean time, I believe an important group to test are healthcare workers. This seems an obvious statement but, at least in Texas, it is nearly impossible to get easily accessible testing for physician, nurses, etc.
As an anesthesiologist, one of the ""most at risk"" specialties, I was denied testing as I am asymptomatic (for now). I'm caring for up to 50 patients a week.
My colleague with a very busy pain management practice just returned from the Caribbean (a country with no known cases at the time) and has been denied testing, again he's asymptomatic, but yet ""quarantined"" for two weeks from patient care. I don't disagree with isolating someone with unknown risk but this is why we need readily accessible testing for those who care for others.
Certainly, for now, we're in a less impacted region but if this non-rational distribution of testing continues here and elsewhere, there will be a significant shortage of healthcare personnel to care for those who do become ill from coronavirus or other ailments."

2020-03-19 15:07:35,"You don't have to have symptoms to spread the virus. Test, test, test...."
2020-03-19 15:00:50,"Why the surprise? This is the American way. (1) 37 to 40 million people have no health insurance. (2) an additional 41 million have minimal insurance. As a consequence, an estimated 61,000 people die each year in the USA. Life expectancy has been going down for 4 years, slightly up only recently. Talk about ""death panels,"" we live in one.
All these people would still be alive in other advanced countries. We are indeed ""exceptional."" 
Sanders only sought to make us like the more humane countries in the world, an return us to the New Deal era of Roosevelt, defending the common good. The Republicans, and the Demoblicans have pushed Sanders to the side. We are going to vote for the continuation of the ""vile maxim of the masters of mankind: ""All for us, and nothing for the rest"" (Adam Smith, ""The Wealth of Nations"" 1776) Making America Great!"

2020-03-19 15:15:18,Them that has gets. And who says that we don't have a privileged class in America. Impose a 10% wealth tax on them all.
2020-03-19 15:22:39,The virus overreaction is driven by the older generation of baby boomers who are mostly in charge now. They are most vulnerable - but most of us are not. Children’s lives and development - the future - have been out on hold for this generation of egomaniacs who want to be omnipotent and live forever.
2020-03-19 14:51:59,"Can a Times reporter please find out why we rejected the plentiful WHO test kits that were offered to us weeks ago and I imagine still could be? It must have to do with who is making the money -- it always does. As a starter, I would like to know who made that decision."
2020-03-19 14:52:42,"One line stands out. 

In areas where the virus has been slow to spread, there are tests. 

And in areas where it is rampant, people can’t find tests. 

Part of the Administration’s plan? Test lots where you don’t think you’ll find it, and don’t test where you think you will. 

That’s one way to look like you are winning. 

But you are still losing. And people are dying."
2020-03-19 14:56:01,Isn't it fun to have a system that can so readily recreate the conditions of Medieval Europe?

2020-03-19 14:51:29,"Did they a higher fee to get in front of the line, they certainly can afford it. Plus, profiteering is likely from the testing physicians..."
2020-03-19 14:52:26,"It is not why people want money and fame at a fundamental level? And is it not what capitalism called competition that drives economic growth? Famous people used to be an example for others to pursue, now they just become something that makes us think if you got money - you may not have to care about anything - you may get away with being unfair, rude, and more. 

I do not want us to change everything, not possible for a lot of us. Still, this narrow concept of competition is what makes the life of lots of people miserable within the normal framework of social life under the capitalist structure. I hope some of us will come out of this pandemic crisis, and rethink the way we live our lives nowadays. Mean people are the ones considered the people ""who know how to get the job done"" - that is utterly depressing to me. This "" just get the job done"" attitude in the workplace is not taking us anywhere. Plus, running the economy of a community based on consumption could be fatal for long term crises like this."
2020-03-19 14:56:19,"""with testing still in short supply in areas of the country. . .""

""Areas""? Isn't testing in short supply EVERYWHERE in the country? Certainly in Philadelphia you must not only have a physician's OK, you must also already be exhibiting symptoms. The fact that 3 of the 4 Brooklyn Nets who tested positive were asymptomatic shows that this is woefully insufficient.

Where in the U.S. can anybody who needs a test get it? Isn't the answer ""nowhere""?"
2020-03-19 15:19:43,"If we were an advanced country, like the Republic of Korea or Canada, we would have massive, easily accessible testing. There would be no favoritism.  Inasmuch as we elected a banana Republican, Donald Trump, as President ordinary Americans must run a time wasting gauntlet to get tested.  

I recommend, however, that all members of the House and Senate get tested, at the front of the line.  We elected them to do the people's business.  Now, more than ever, as Moscow Mitch just demonstrated by going AWOL for a long weekend, we need them to act speedily on a number of COVID-19 related measures.  By finding and isolating the infected, we will preserve the uninfected members so that they can do their duty to us, the citizenry.  

Can somebody, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Mike Bloomberg, any sensible rich guy, pay for a manufacturer to produce a large supply of ventilators and arrange for distribution to hospitals throughout the land?  

It is clear, with all the futzing around, that the Trump administration doesn't know how to do a Willow Run for short supply protective equipment."
2020-03-19 15:22:52,So many celebrities and other public figures are testing positive but they aren't very sick at all.  What else does this tell us besides that they are privileged to get tested? It tells us that this virus is already widespread and many people have very mild symptoms.
2020-03-19 14:55:22,"If everyone gets tested cheaply, where is the profits for our highly marked up hospitals?"
2020-03-19 15:10:49,If one guy on a team tests positive and gets all sorts of wonderful attention and hopefully a positive outcome does that mean the rest of their team tested negative but we don't hear about the 'not news?' That would be a lot of tests used on people not taking up healthcare resources that could have been freed up by a negative test results.
2020-03-19 15:20:12,"I cannot be tested because my symptoms are not severe enough.   But I’m asked to quarantine at home for at least two weeks.   What will contribute to the spread is people with symptoms that aren’t severe since these are the people healthy enough to go around shedding virus.   
Are they limiting testing in order to limit the panic or is the federal government that inept?   
The federal government has completely botched thus one and a lot of people are going to die."
2020-03-19 14:53:41,"Of course the rich and well connected are going to get tests ahead of everyone else.  They get everything else ahead of the crowd, why would healthcare be different, it wouldn't."
2020-03-19 15:03:16,"On the other hand, we can all be greatly reassured that Old Yeller has transformed into a ""wartime president"" battling an ""invisible enemy."" He actually has some experience with this --- with his bone spurs that mysteriously appeared and then vanished as soon as he was no longer in peril of having to serve his country in the military. It was, as he might put it, ""a miracle.""

Whether this will work on the Trump Virus remains to be seen."
2020-03-19 15:05:19,"Maybe we should also be identifying those that have recovered from the virus and are no longer contagious so that they can get back to work, school or whatever it was they were doing."
2020-03-19 15:12:24,"There seems to be an erroneous impression out there, that if  you're tested and the results are negative, you're ""home free"". This leads people to demand the test, thinking that it will hopefully show that they're invincible i.e. immune, and they can resume regular activities.
On the contrary; you could still get infected at a later time, so the self-isolation is even more important.
Granted that some carriers are not showing symptoms and this test might then alert their communities, but presently there are not enough kits to routinely test everyone.
There's also the worrisome prospect that people don't understand that the test cannot identify which people have already recovered from COVID-19 -- that will require yet a different, and very costly, blood test."
2020-03-19 15:14:15,"i came down with all the symptoms last thursday - 103 fever, body aches, runny nose, slight cough.  I live with my asthmatic daughter, am the primary caregiver for my 90 year old mother who lives alone, and I am a school social worker.  I didn't meet the criteria."
2020-03-19 15:16:22,"Maybe I missed it, but I haven't seen any decent in depth description or analysis of the test/s it self.  What is the test?  How is it administered? What technology underlies it?  How long does it take for a test sample to be analyzed not including transit times?  Is the machine that analyzes the sample unique to Covid-19 or is it a standard piece of tech that can be set up to analyze for C19?  How long does it take to manufacture testing kits?  Who makes the tests?  Are they running production 24/7?  I could go on and on.  Where is that article NYT?  Might help explain why a test took so long in this country.  Might also point out that there is no excuse for not having a test quickly. (And yes I have googled some of these questions but nothing is organized neatly in one location not to mention that some sites providing information are too technically specialized for me to understand without hours of self educating)."
2020-03-19 14:51:53,"If ever there was an example of why the U.S. needs a government-backed insurance option, this is it. Sadly, what should be a basic right of being a citizen in the U.S. have turned into a privilege of the wealthy."
2020-03-19 14:55:21,We missed the boat on PCR tests (they only detect if the virus is currently in the body-- whether or not the person is symptomatic or not).  At this point we really need to start widespread serology tests.  They are cheaper to make and easier to process.  Serology tests detect antibodies (proteins that the body makes in response to the virus) so we would know who already had the virus and is thus immune.  At this point we know thousands of people must have been exposed and mounted a response to the virus without ever knowing.  It would be extremely helpful to know who is safe to go out and help their community.  Especially helpful for healthcare professionals to know who is actually at risk and who is ok to work with infected patients.
2020-03-19 14:57:21,I work at a very large hospital system; we do not have enough tests for staff who are stuck in quarantine and cannot provide medical care.
2020-03-19 15:30:13,"""She was told that she did not meet the criteria for testing and that she should treat her symptoms at home.""

This just should not be.

Sending me two checks does not change this."
2020-03-19 15:41:30,"Another problem for the rest of us?

If we present symptoms, doctors will still run a full battery of tests on us to rule out other causes for our infection before getting us a test (if they can even get a test). 

So our laboratories are running extra, unnecessary tests, and our insurance bills for all this other tests? Yep. Those aren’t covered by the federal government, even if the test for COVID-19 is."
2020-03-19 14:49:07,"Sad but not surprising.  What’s even worse is that the game show host who the Electoral College picked to be President doesn’t care about it.

Best thing Trump could do right now is resign.  His incompetence is going to kill us all."
2020-03-19 15:01:05,"We live in a capitalist society, the wealthy stay healthy and the poor die."
2020-03-19 15:05:03,I'm so glad Heidi Klum got tested because in the zombie apocalypse there will be a huge demand for supermodels.
2020-03-19 15:26:05,"America, it’s sad to see how you discriminate your rich and privileged against the middle income and poor. However, many of you shall not complain, because this all began when Trump was elected on his America First agenda.    

Now, it is obvious that America mistreats most of her citizens to suffer the misery of Corona virus and stuff their mouth with a few dollar bills when at the same time wreaking havoc to her economy. 

Trump has become America’s nightmare."
2020-03-19 15:29:11,"I think it is pathetic that we get hourly updates on how Tom Hanks is handling his quarantine and the Ronna McDaniels Romney tested negative.


I hope people keep this fiasco in mind next November"
2020-03-19 15:32:37,"This administration's response is shameful. The data on total COVID-19 tests performed by country are illuminating: <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing"" target=""_blank"">https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing</a>"
2020-03-19 15:30:10,"Another example of comforting the comfortable, and afflicting the afflicted."
2020-03-19 15:37:06,"Wonder how to pay for what those in charge value in this country? Obama bailed out Wall Street, not Main Street. How many millions have never recovered? We all know trickle down doesn’t work. Need 500billion right now? Trump can get it printed. Where’s that money going? If we valued universal access to healthcare, it wouldn’t be ‘pie in the sky’ as Clinton and Biden say, it would be impossible to fund. It would be Boom! Paid for.  But what do those in power want money for? Not our healthcare. Judging from actions and priorities, they don’t care if most of us die, unless it inconveniences the obscenely wealthy. Actions speak louder than words. And we are all on our own in this ‘great’ country, unless you own the politicians who let you write the laws."

2020-03-19 15:32:40,"“If we had waited for players to exhibit symptoms, they might have continued to pose a risk to their family, friends and the public.”
Well duh, that’s how it”s spreading and will continue to spread without wide testing of the public."
2020-03-19 15:33:43,So status quo America? Is anyone really still surprised by this?
2020-03-19 15:36:10,"Reel it in a little folks. Of course famous  people  are being tested. So are poor people. 

The government want to bring high profile cases forward so everyone takes this seriously. Everyone. Now go home . And stay there for 2 weeks. Social isolation for 14 days is a test. If you don't show symptoms after that. You probably don't have the virus. You may be asymptomatic. So maintain social distancing after that. If we all do this we will radically diminish the number of infections. Go home , stay there for a few weeks."
2020-03-19 15:38:50,"This article is a lot of disingenuous wide-eyed wondering if the rich and powerful have special access.  Um, asked and answered."
2020-03-19 15:38:55,"And this is a surprise to exactly who? I mean seriously, who doesn't believe that being rich and famous isn't an asset these days."
2020-03-19 15:27:13,"I'm o.k. with that if it gets the message out.

But the number of celeb positives should certainly be a cautionary tale for the rest of us.

Many, many more of us are infected than know."
2020-03-19 15:28:55,"A wealthy local has volunteered to provide testing to the entire population of San Miguel County, the wealthy seat of the town and ski area of Telluride.  Everyone in America should have access but clearly the wealthy have real access."
2020-03-19 15:33:09,"'In areas of the country where the virus has been slow to appear, people have been able to obtain tests easily.""

This isn't accurate."
2020-03-19 14:45:48,"In the case of the basketball team with 4 players who tested positive, I think testing the whole team was justified.

The reason is because if some of the other members of the team were infected but were asymptomatic, then they could spread the infection to their families.

After all playing on the court together and sharing a locker room is hardly practicing social distancing.

The fault here lies not with the NBA but the Trump administration and the agencies (looking at you CDC) who screwed up on being ready with test kits for all."
2020-03-19 14:28:47,"As there s no antidote...…..and I know the necessity of tracking..thru computors etc is necessary...how is i t that the South Koreans are using ROBOTIC testing with results going to a mainframe computor enabling results in a few hours to be sent to a pnone,database etc. with using drivein style testing..a scanning code.....getting Medical records in Universal Healthcare is much easier than taking my senior symtomatc (97 yr old Father to the overstressed GP to call a lab,test,whatever in the US Healthcare system...…..Robots are not carriers nor can be infected....hey Military,Sceintific community,MIT….whats up!!!!!Cheek swabs..."
2020-03-19 15:23:12,"This virus has really made clear the dangers of creating an industry out of healthcare and medicine. Our local hospitals are conducting Covid-19 testing without necessary protective gear, and most of us can’t even get tested. We need healthcare that covers everyone. If you want a fancy room or a fancy doctor, or elective surgery like face lifts and butt lifts, you can pay extra. But the basic care like testing and treatment of diseases should be available equally to everyone in this country, not just a few celebrities and wealthy individuals."
2020-03-19 14:33:47,"The Hasidic neighborhoods in Brooklyn have no problem getting tested, despite flaunting the regulations and having large weddings and gatherings. I guess because they vote in a bloc, nothing will be denied them."

2020-03-19 15:59:55,"Getting the basketball players tested early on led to the decision to shut down the NBA season early and got the dominoes to fall quickly in other sports - put the few players aside for a moment - this started the process of social distancing and stopping large crowds from gathering even before the public was ready to take it seriously.

But hey, if we want to waste time on this egalitarian navel gazing, knock yourself out.   About as useful as crowing about the racism some claim is inherent in the colloquial designation of the virus.   Recall SARS, MERS, Norwalk virus (I doubt any Ohioans are offended - this scourge of cruise ship patrons was first identified in Norwalk, Ohio).   If your anxieties are offended and cast you into the abyss over a moniker for this virus, go hug a stuffed bunny and get over yourself.  There are lots of people, myself included who have more important things to do responding to this current national urgency.

These comments may seem a bit harsh, but journalists who cross the line past information and engage in gotcha moments when the camera is briefly on them should stick it in their ear."

2020-03-19 15:49:10,"Yes ...of course...they that have always can get. 

This situations is changing quickly now with all the positive steps being taken.  The fact that we weren’t prepared much earlier will be a great subject of scholarly research for the coming years and be cited as reason—along with many others for trump loss in November.  trump’s morally bankrupt instincts were of course at the heart of the unacceptable response to Coronavirus during January and February.  His efforts now are obvious and finally correct, but like a fire that wasn’t fought at its outset the effects are much worse now than necessary.  His rhetoric is as full as narcissistic bravado as ever and not worth hearing. 

trump’s presidency is just about over...he and his somnolent administration will be thrown out decisively in a landslide victory by Biden come November; count on it!

2020-03-19 16:21:40,"Aggressive social distancing and avoiding contact outside your own household to the extent possible accompanied by rigorous personal hygiene are the mainstays of control.

Testing on the scale of our country in its entirety is not technologically feasible, nor is it advisable across the board.  At any given time, there will be symptomatic people with the Flu, RSV or least likely COVID-19.  COVID-19 patients may test neg early on when with low virus shedding. Testing of the symptomatic has already ramped up dramatically.   In Cleveland for example, University Hospitals and the Cleveland Clinic are operating two drive through centers for the public based on pre screening through telemedicine.  Several thousand have been tested so far,   Triple screen for Flu, RSV and COVID-19.   + rate for COVID-19 ~ 3% so far.   Vast majority self quarantine at home with telemedicine follow up.   Hospitalization of the positive group based on symptoms.

The response is spooling up very rapidly at the local level - based on rational medical evaluation and data.   This cooperation between the private and public sector has been impressive as seen from the inside.  

First and foremost, avoid unnecessary in person social contact outside your household, still practice scrupulous hygiene, hand washing, don't touch your face.   Wife and I work in health care - outside shoes and work clothes are shed in the garage, immediate scrub shower inside, all clothes worn outside the house washed immediately."

I pay more than that and I'm far from rich.  Tax the wealthy at a high rate...they will still be rich beyond the dreams of most of us, but the nation will be healthier for it.

I've been to two different healthcare systems in the Portland, Oregon area and cannot get tested for Coronavirus.  I couldn't even get tested after 10 hours in the emergency room receiving five liters of fluid and three rounds of IV antibiotics. (One part of my pneumonia is bacterial.)

Just look at the trillion with more than half going to mega-corps so that the 1% can split it up amongst the top executives just like past bailouts. Oh, I forgot they don't like the term bailouts.

Disparity between claimed kits available and tests performed suggests two possibilities.  Either Trump/Pence lied about number of  test kits distributed or administration has miserably failed to use the kits to perform widespread testing to identify and isolate those who test positive.  

Either scenario is pathetic display of lies and incompetence on part of administration.  Media and democratic law makers need to ask for daily and cumulative updates and also demand to verify/audit the actual test kits available."

The testing seems more related to finding out who else might have been exposed rather than the tested person's health or treatment.

Brazil's president was apparently tested twice in the span of a few hours. 1st test was positive but hours later his son announced the 2nd test was negative. For the rich and powerful, turn around time is a few hours or maybe even ""just wait here the doctor will be right with you"" quick"

The most consequential effect of testing these few athletes was the cascade of season cancellations that quickly ensued in all sports at the pro, collegiate and amateur level.   The elimination of these crowd gatherings long before the public was ready to embrace aggressive social distancing was a big jump forward in modifying group behavior by default.    No events, no closely packed crowds in the arena or gym.   Huge return on a minuscule investment in effort at the time.

I call attention to the fact that our country is ranked #32 out of the top 35 developed countries for hospital beds per capita. The culprit? As discussed in a recent article in this very newspaper, the ACA expanded Medicaid and high deductible bronze plans, both of which either reimburse hospitals and doctors below our cost (Medicaid) or leave the patients with thousands of dollars of deductibles which they can’t and don’t pay. The number of annual hospital closures per year now runs about 100. And healthcare workers had been leaving medicine in droves due to the stress.

So, how many people are likely to die over 18 months? At a 1% case fatality rate x 31 million, that's 310,000, right? BUT - if half of people who go into ICU don't make it, that suggests as many as 3.5 million people wouldn't make it. That's 7x the number who died in the 1918 epidemic.

The US failure to have adequate testing available 4-6 weeks ago rates as one of the most serious failures of US government ever, swamping whatever mistakes might have been made in 2008.  Those problems were solvable by turning on the printing press.  These problems will result in inconsolable tragedy.  Helicopter money may avert a Great Depression but it will not avert a Great Tragedy.   And I think the testing failure and the outcome are significantly because the President did not want to hear bad news that would upset the market and the relevant public officials were too cowed to push back publicly (or, to be charitable, thought they could do more good by staying).  Shameful."

2020-03-18 11:59:47,"A lurking disaster is clear in the number of acute care beds and in specialized life-saving equipment if there is not a prolonged flattening of the number of new coronavirus infections.

Not addressed but as important is the lurking disaster in a shortfall in necessary medical personnel, a shortfall that may well increase over time as the number of medical personnel shrink due to contracting the coronavirus and exhaustion. 

Our military can and should be called on to expand the number of hospital beds and the private sector should be called on to act with patriotism and compassion to quickly ramp up production of needed equipment.  

An initiative should be launched to recruit medical personnel to obtain crash training and transition to acute care AND to recruit new nursing assistants with speed training in the nursing tasks of acute respiratory infection care.   
  
Finally, there must be adequate on-going and subsequent support in all domains for the providers and their families, e.g., anguish and more over deciding who lives and dies, depression and PTSD seeming from the suffering (respiratory difficulty is very unpleasant) and loss of life, in many cases preventable with adequate resources."

By all means be super careful with this virus but one can legitimately argue if we are going too far ie putting ourselves into another Great Depression to stop a serious virus.

All the stats here re this virus are medical guesses, that's all. 

Until we have solid facts after the fact, you really don't know good medical predictive advice. 

It is similar to the past pandemics like the 1918 flu. Even now, we don't know a lot about it because we cannot examine the people that died from it like we can do today.

2020-03-18 12:06:33,"It is a simple fact that there are not enough hospital beds to handle this emergency. I think China built a new hospital in a matter of a couple of weeks. What surprises us in Canada that there has been no options offered in the US for the building of new hospitals. They certainly would not go to waste in the future. We always think that building new hospitals to protect all US citizens equally would perhaps look like a form of universal healthcare and many of the elites would be against that. Here in Canada we should also build more hospitals ,but the financial restrictions are much more that the US for many reasons. One of of which is that we already have universal healthcare without calling each other   ""socialists""."

   Good luck."
2020-03-18 12:26:44,"This will be primarily a staff shortage, not a bed or equipment shortage, as we can build ventilators and commandeer beds but they're useless without the staff. The CDC should have already published recommendations on how to train temporary  emergency staff, advised remotely by experts, to run ventilators etc. Why is the federal government still sleeping at the wheel? We should be throwing money at this, not at welfare for airline executives."
2020-03-18 12:38:42,"Perhaps some of the universities and colleges that are sending students home could make dorms available as backup beds for nearby hospitals, especially since many hospitals are affiliated with a university. Dorms could provide space for recovering patients, for example, to free up hospital space and staff."
2020-03-18 12:12:40,"A few things here would  help:

1. Mobilize the military. They have doctors, nurses, and medics that can add to the personnel situation.

2. Set up those portable FEMA and Military hospitals anywhere an outbreak is starting.

3. Use the Defense Production Act to compel factories to make the ICU units, ventilators, gowns, masks, hand sanitizers, etc. that are desperately needed to protect doctors and treat patients.

4. Shut down most domestic air travel. It's not the time for the reckless  young to be spreading this illness further. Flying = large gathering of people with no possibility of social distancing."

2020-03-18 13:28:21,"Estimates about available ICU beds do not seem to include other quasi-ICU spaces in hospitals, notably operating rooms and pre- and post-anesthesia care units.  Operating rooms are going to be fallow in many hospitals because surgery is going to be emergency only.  In many hospitals, the perioperative care units are equivalent to ICU space with monitoring.  The limitations in such scenarios are availability of nursing and physician staff.  We see the early effects of staff becoming exposed or infected and on quarantine in an editorial from a UK physician in today's Times.  The other issue relating to surge capacity is the availability of ventilators, which will be a key limit, as will be the availability of respiratory therapists who can support their use.

This article brings forth yet another reason for testing for COVID and for someone to create a test for post-exposure antibodies.  Since over 80% of coronavirus cases are minimally or asymptomatic, a healthcare provider who may well have had the virus and is now healed should be able to go back to work safely, but we don't know who these people are, because we don't have testing."

I watched my wife walk down the block 30 minutes ago in her scrubs until she walked around a corner on the way to her bus. Normally, I would be at my desk sipping coffee and reading the news.

A month ago my ICU Nurse with 40+ years of experience sat down with a brand new RN that was working in a coffee shop. Hospitals all but stopped new graduate training years ago to cut costs.  They dropped non RN Care Partners, essentially skilled gophers to help them. They dropped unit clerks and on and on.

The new RN was trying to figure out the best way to get experience so she could get into a hospital position and was asking my wife the best way to do that.

A week later at a Hospital Meeting my wife suggested to the management that they should advertise for new RN's to come in and become care partners at the hip of experienced ICU nurses. Not the traditional ICU training that takes months and that 20% drop or flush out of.

She was told that ""that is not practical"".

She asked if they could take one entire hospital in the region and move everyone out to other hospitals and fix one facility to care for Covid-19 cases. She was told they could not do that.

She then asked about proper, and full, protective equipment for the staff. Sure...

The bigger response we make now, the better long term response we can sustain with our existing healthcare system.  Send everyone home and enforce the lockdown.  Stretching the pandemic out to 18 months also improves the odds for vaccinations and effective anti-viral treatments for the infected along with more ventilators, hospital beds and more sustainable staffing situations for doctors and nurses.

However, in China's nearly fully subsided epidemic (10-20 cases per day, down from nearly 4000+ per day a the peak), only approximately 80,000 symptomatic cases were observed, or 0.004% of the population, nowhere close to 20%, the lowest number envisioned in this article.

Carnival Corporation ships, such as the Holland America Line based in Seattle, are uniquely positioned to provide such a service. 

These ships already have procedures in place for disinfecting the entire ship, they have crew quarters that can house 
staff, and they have some areas of the ship which can be used for medical clinics and procedures in addition to their 
onboard medical clinics. 

They also are able to provide food services, and are set up to receive supplies and dispose of trash and garbage in well-regulated procedures.  

They already have physical security measures in place which limit access to and from the ships, even when docked.
When docked, they ca be used for non-critical patients, but can rapidly transfer a patient to a critical care facility, such as a hospital. 

Additionally, at present, the cruise ships are not able to operate as normal, which means lost revenue.  Leasing these 
ships is a cost-effective way to provide the necessary facilities for dealing with a large number of patients and can 
provide some income to the cruise line industry. 

It sounds like a good idea to me."

I'm not against building more hospital capacity just reporting that uses maps to scare the you-know-what out of people in a time when we need to calm down a bit and simply keep our social distance while the initial, hopefully not too severe, wave of this comes over. 

If 20% of all cases are severe enough to require hospital stays - a reasonable/accurate number given the global trends that say 80-85% of cases are mild/moderate - the 60% cases will be equivalent to about 12% of the entire adult population they are basing this estimate on - a scenario that not one of these maps shows.

Might lead to stark realization that our health care system in this country really needs to managed and financed as a public service, just like we do police, fire, libraries, etc."
2020-03-18 15:57:33,"This is a good time for people to draw up health directives. 

My 82 year old father has given us a copy of his directive which states that he does not any mechanical invasive care like ventilators or intubations should he become ill for any reason.   In the event of a severe illness, he’d opt for simple comfort through morphine and fluids and wants to pass with as much dignity and comfort as possible. 

Putting very elderly and frail people in intensive care also has risks in that intensive care puts a lot of stress on the body and they may have decreased function if they survive for a few years after the hospitalization. 

My mother has drawn up a different health directive. She is somewhat younger and she does not rule out some invasive procedures. 

Of course we must respect both their wishes even if they differ. 

These are times which remind us we can still make some well thought out decisions about our lives and death."
2020-03-18 15:58:58,Both river- and ocean-going cruise ships can be moved where needed to house at-risk elders and hospital patients who are not contagious.  The larger ships can provide temporary living quarters for medical professionals and support staff.
2020-03-18 16:08:10,"There are some comments here suggesting that we simply impose a tight quarantine on at-risk populations and let everyone else go about their lives. I don't think the people making these suggestions understand that this virus doesn't just kill the elderly and infirm. For example, the mortality rate for a person with diabetes and high blood pressure is roughly the same as that for a 79 year old man. Plus, we do not as of yet have a complete list of comorbidities, and even if we quarantined the ones we know about (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pregnancy, auto-immune disease, breathing difficulties, etc.) we are talking about such an enormous number that there is really no way to identify and quarantine them all effectively. Someone would need to run the actual numbers, but it has to be close to 50% of the adult population."
2020-03-18 16:08:38,"In Denmark, where I am from, the very critical issue is considered to be the number of nurses qualified to operate ventilators and look after patients in need of intensive care. The lack these competences has been a key argument for a speedy closing down of the country thereby postponing the inflow of patients and giving time for education."
2020-03-18 16:22:09,"I think that this highlights how we're going to need to get creative in dealing with this as a society.  We can't let our entire world collapse over this disease.  Will be be in better shape if we all survive but have 20 years of rebuilding our economies and an entire generation that is financially ruined?

The only way this is solved is through either a known-effective vaccine or through cheap testing that offers immediate results.

Outside of either of those long-shots we need to figure out how to carry on as safely as possible.

We're in reaction mode right now. Officials keep saying, ""we'll close schools and offices for two or four weeks."" We all need to get serious. We need to treat this like a world war. This could go on for many, many months. We will likely have to live with this disease for years. It's time for some creative forward-thinking.  We won't get it from the White House. I hope other countries can begin to solve this and create a model the U.S. can follow.

Shutting down society for a year and a half will be worse than the damage of the disease by far."

The problem is going to be equipment and staffing."
2020-03-18 16:44:14,"There appears to be a disconnect between the assumption used for hospitalization rates and the assumption used for infection rates. ProPublica's article about this same study says ""... epidemiologists said the 20% estimate is conservative based on the infection rates that have occurred in prior pandemics. The numbers of infections reported by China and other countries, they said, are surely underestimates since not all infected people are tested or have serious symptoms."" This makes sense to me. But in that case, using China's data on hospitalization rates for infected people is surely an overestimate, as the denominator should include the additional assumed infected people without serious symptoms, who would not be added to the numerator."
2020-03-18 16:46:22,"""The military itself may be able to help build new facilities and staff them"" 

If we're still talking about this then it's not happening, and if it's not happening, as in, today, it may be too late to avert the multiple crisis we keep hearing about. Since there is no effective leadership at the top, can't a bunch of retired/current generals just handle this right now? Forget about Trump, he'll never know anything is occurring unless it involves him. People with a modicum of authority need to act; today. Ask for forgiveness later."
2020-03-18 16:53:07,"The model is based on the assumption that 20 % of those infected with the virus need hospitalization and 20 % of these ICU care.   However, this seems to be a gross overestimate, at least based on the latest data.  Perhaps most people who have the virus have only mild symptoms and some no symptoms at all.    Furthermore, in the UK there are an estimated 50,000 with the virus (factoring in those not tested because they have not gone to the hospital) but only 100 deaths so far (= 0.2 % fatality rate).    I would like to see the modelling done with some more realistic numbers.   A model is only as good as the numbers put into it."

If folks are working from home, etc., a couple of city garages aren't going to be missed so much.  Hey maybe even a large city hospital garage can be utilized?"
2020-03-18 17:03:22,"@The Baron 
I think anyone over the age of 55 should have a health care directive that addresses these concerns. But it brings up age old philosophical questions--is youth the only qualifier? 

Let us all be in this together and quarantine so we can be safer. There must other solutions. We know how grim this line of thinking can become.   

When any of us old folks become ill, we can head to the street where the trash collectors can sweep us up--really not so bad except to the poor trash collectors. Or maybe we can alleviate the burden to our families and communities and head to our favorite tree where we can rest and hear the birds, and sleep in peace until we can be properly be disposed of. Oh, so much nicer than being hooked up to a ventilator in a hospital threatening others. 

Peace to everyone."
2020-03-18 17:03:58,"During the Falkland War in 1982 the British military medical system was completely overwhelmed.  Many of the wounded were only given the most basic battlefield care and left to heal on their own.  Much to the surprise of the surgeons and other doctors, these patients recovered very well and, in some cases, more quickly than those that had received hospital treatment for similar injuries.  Conclusion, the human immunity and repair system works very well, when not interfered with through medication.

Sure, the comparison is far from perfect, but still there is a lesson.  We will be obliged to take a very cold hard look at who gets lengthy support in hospitals, but in the knowledge that someone who is young and healthy may very well recover perfectly without a lot of the attention, time and medication we now regularly and unthinkingly administer.  Bearing this in mind would have a very important effect on the availability of hospital capacity."
2020-03-18 17:05:49,One thing I haven't heard discussed is the need for more doctors and nurses. Medical professionals are going to be overwhelmed in even a moderate scenario. It might be a good idea to fast track visa requirements for medical professionals who want to immigrate to the US.

2020-03-18 17:15:55,"Possibly not as infectious as predicted.  Currently the little data we have says that in Wuhan China there were about 70,000 COVID cases in a population of 11 million. An infection rate of less than 1%. Further infection in Wuhan has slowed dramatically. In Lombardy Italy there are about 30,000 cases in a population of 10 million.  Again less than 1% overall infection.  Both areas are locked down so we do not know what happens after restrictions are eased. However it does give us some basis to hope that the infection rate here will be closer to 1% than the 20-60% submitted here."
2020-03-18 17:34:18,"The question of how long immunity is acquired by people when they do get sick is still unknown.  A health expert on an NPR radio show recently said she estimated the immunity could be  short, like weeks, or it could be longer,  perhaps between one to three years. A year would still buy time for treatments and a vaccine. But if the virus is contagious, spread easily by people while they have no or mild  symptoms, and immunity wanes after a year or possibly less,  then we may need to be thinking longer term about increasing hospital beds, ventilators, and health care staff."
2020-03-18 17:43:08,"In some places in California, the ventilators are already running low.  Nurses are trying to learn how to set-up one ventilator for four people (unheard of).  This is why people need to STAY HOME and completely isolate to stop the spread.  And people just don't get it.  We've done far too little, far too late.

As I write this, people are still intermingling throughout the country, blissfully unaware that are likely already a carrier and infecting dozens of other people along the way, while they go about their day-to-day interactions."
2020-03-18 18:00:47,"I am not thrilled with this article that basically tells me nothing I did not already know; nothing that both the federal government and the state governments and the health community are not already working on.  I want to know what % of the total population is likely to get infected and when.  I want to know what % of those infected are likely to need hospital care and what % of those needing hospital care will  need to be ventilated.  I want to know what medications we should take at home first to boost immunity and second those that might slow the progression of the disease if we get it.  For example, I just read an article from a science journal  that said that the WHO is recommending that those infected not take ibuprofen.  Is that correct?  I could go on and on with many medical questions, but you get the gist of what I'm saying.  I know it takes time to find these answers, but I sure hope someone's working on it, and that the NYT with be getting us that information."
2020-03-18 18:25:46,I attended two concerts in San Francisco last week along with 1300 other people.  I've been home for a week and so far OK.  My fear was infecting others.  So far where I live numbers are low but doubtlessly increasing.  There's a grocery store near me that will select items requested that can be picked up in a locker outside.  More groceries should do that.  Home for me has been a lifelong safe place so cabin fever isn't one of my problems.
2020-03-18 19:17:08,"The ""shedding hundreds of thousands of hospital beds"" was in the name of efficiency, which meant saving money (in all hospitals, not only for-profit ones).  We now see what ""efficiency"" in health care means for true health care.  A good health care system means there has to be a reserve for crises; ""efficiency"" as recently understood here assumed everything would always be normal.  The same kind of thinking led to abolishing special federal pandemic units (unless it was due to Trump's germophobia)."
2020-03-18 19:34:51,"I am not a medical expert but I wonder if these maps do any good, except to spread more fear and panic.  What I have read indicates that many persons that contact this virus are not ill enough to need hospitalization.  I assume that as the virus spreads temporary medical facilities will set up to handle COVID 19 cases to help the hospitals out and keep the less serious cases out of the hospital.  These maps make it apparent why we need to flatten the curve, but hopefully we can improvise some effective temporary solutions when and where we need to."
2020-03-18 19:43:18,"We need an economic stimulus program that builds out our healthcare infrastructure to prepare us for future pandemics while providing increased margin to tackle Covid-19.

2020-03-18 19:49:14,"These remain unrealistically optimistic numbers.  The Times' own interactive model, replicated by other studies such as the Imperial College one (which posits itself as a ""best case scenario,"" given they accept implicitly, as the Times does, that a China-scale response will not be mounted), shows a peak in mid-summer, reduced only by full burnout in the population, with half a million dead in the UK and 2 million in the US -- more in all likelihood because mortality will go up as each hospital bed will have a dozen or more vying for it. 

So put up a 60% chart in 3 months.  That's the current extrapolated reality.

On this scale, 54,000 a day will die in the U.S. in mid June, more than the total U.S. deaths in Vietnam.  The sum total of dead will exceed all U.S. combat deaths in all its wars, and probably exceed all U.S. war-related deaths in toto."

We are in a war against a bug we know little about, unsure of the costs, and don't know when it can be controlled. The White House is taking the Herbert Hoover approach to staving off a temporary financial downturn. We have a more serious problem - saving lives. Look at at a worse case scenario - a hundred million dead, no income, little money to buy food, no money to pay the rent or the mortgage. This calls for  multi-pronged action now. The White House is only addressing a portion of the crisis. It is time for The War Powers Act of 1942 to be invoked. Someone should be in charge of the manufacturing of all health care products (hospital beds, ventilators,masks, gloves, etc.) needed to battle Coronavirus, health care services, and personnel. The military needs to turn empty hotels and universities into temporary hospitals. ICE should only deport the criminals and not the other illegals for the duration, thereby having illegals get medical care without fear of being picked up, and not spreading the virus. This is war. Normal is out. During World War II, Roosevelt had Bynes in charge of domestic war activities, he had Ike, he had MacArthur, etc. Our president wants to be in charge of everything. That's a recipe for disaster. The clock is ticking down. We need to move in the right direction now!"
2020-03-18 16:05:06,"We see nothing close to the doom and gloom numbers in China where the virus has been decreasing in infection rate for weeks now.  Factory production is up to 80-90%.  The virus has basically burned through the ground zero country in 2-3 months.  Just look at the facts from China.
Smoking is a good indicator of respiratory diseases (emphysema, etc). China has a 25% over all smoking rate which includes 50% of all males.
For Comparison US has a 17.25% smoking rate with only 19.5% males.
The hypertension death rate per 100,000 as per ICD codes in China is 17.4 vs 7.4 in the US.
So China has 3Xs the males that smoke & more than 2Xs the rate of hypertension leading to death.
So 2 of the most important measures of population health that have been linked to CoVid-19 clearly shows China to be much more susceptible in regards to serious cases of CoVid-19 and thus mortality.
Add further that US medical care is much better than that in China.
Why haven't we seen these catastrophic numbers in China where the curve has already leveled off or is downward.
Why does the media and government agencies ignore the most relevant recent history in China?
There is something very wrong here with these numbers and forecasts."

If this is SOP, what will become of us when this pandemic really gears up? 

Most frustrating is the refusal of so many to practice social distancing. The young, in particular, do not seem to grasp the  severity of the situation. Other generations have been asked to go to war, to make the ultimate sacrifice, and yet we cannot even stay in our homes for a few months? If we don't buck up as a nation, this will be far uglier than it is already primed to be.

Any chronically ill person knows the USA's health care industry runs on greed.  The USA is in the business of making money off epidemics, not preventing them.  We have cancer, autism, and diabetes epidemics other countries don't have, the result of post-WWII government policy choices on pesticides and other toxic chemicals in our lives, air pollution, subsidized corn syrup, etc.

Greed-obsessed hospital industry and Pharma industry didn't want to stockpile masks in the basement - they wanted to take that money out and buy a BMW.

When these medics went home home to their families, they infected them, and hence others in exponential fashion.

The answer as to why is simple.  Insurance and even Medicare for that matter want hospitals to discharge sick people and people who have surgery ASAP.  Insurance pays more for outpatient procedures thus, hospitals have no incentive to have beds to treat the sick.  

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has also implemented emergency disaster preparedness regulations over the last few years for all health care providers.  What good are they if you can't take care of patients during a pandemic?!

2020-03-18 18:14:42,What percentage of China’s population was infected? I don’t think it was anywhere near 20%. Why are we projected to have such a worse outcome? Besides the obvious missteps by this administration.
2020-03-18 16:09:44,"1. Why, in a country that spends 1/3 of GDP on health care, do we not have enough health care to handle health needs?
2. Why is the risk of overwhelming hospitals the sole criterion in all current decision-making? Couldn't we protect the vulnerable (or give them the choice - maybe they'd just as soon take the risk of getting sick and perhaps dying, rather than being forced into isolation) without destroying everyone's lives?
3. We are all going to die. Why is it remarkable that a large number of 81-year-olds have died in Italy? Health directives are a fine idea for right now."
2020-03-18 20:09:44,"This is fascinating. Now we see that there's a reason all those ""flatten the curve"" diagrams we've been seeing neglected to include any numbers or scales on the axes. I had read an article yesterday that stated that, under certain scenarios, keeping the curve below the available intensive care capacity meant keeping extreme social distancing measures in place for 10 years! This analysis doesn't exactly confirm this but you see that even under the rosiest scenario and 18 months of curve flattening, we still exceed the number of unoccupied ICU beds."
2020-03-18 00:27:56,"Emergency doc here. These numbers terrify me. There are going to be snapshots in time when there are more patients than beds even in best-case scenario, as patients don't show up evenly distributed in time; this happens somewhat regularly in my area at baseline..."
2020-03-18 01:35:23,"Among the differences in China:
1 An authoritarian government able and confident to dictate full lock down, near total containment to Wuhan initially

2 A culture that is not overtly defiant to authority (in comparison to US, ""it's a free country, I can do whatever I want"" regardless of consideration to consequence to others)

3 Manufacturing capability to construct a hospitals, manufacture of critical supplies masks, tests, CT scanners

4 Segmentation of the problem, building fever clinics outside hospitals

In my opinion, lack of national coordinated response to implement testing (and ideally contact tracing) has already made this a disaster that will last months.

I would imagine the Army is one of a few groups that could nationally deploy fever clinics and testing in a major way. That would of course require the missing testing infrastructure.

As death rates climb, total lock down is inevitable as there is no political calculus that can ignore lock down.

The economy re-opens when people go outside again. Lock down opens up when the total cases level off and death rates fall. This doesn't happen without testing and identification of what trajectory we are on.

This is a massive infrastructure problem that does not go away in weeks."
2020-03-18 20:52:06,"Am I seeing a different trajectory based on the numbers? In New York alone, the current trajectory of daily exponential growth of cases means there will be 1,411,839 infections in about three weeks. Assuming that 20% of these cases are serious enough to require hospitalization (which is the going rate), that's 282,367.  New York only has 53,000 hospital beds currently. 

I mean, it's just basic math.

As should be obvious now, this is primarily affecting the ELDERLY, not the ""millennials"". I say this because Trump's Corona team keeps trying to put the responsibility on the age groups who are not the problem. The elderly are the problem and they need to isolate NOW."
2020-03-18 17:39:10,"Hi, the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and Code for Philly (a local chapter of Code for America) are working on a model for predicting hospital capacity/overload with the corona virus: <a href=""https://penn-chime.phl.io"" target=""_blank"">https://penn-chime.phl.io</a>"

2020-03-18 17:50:22,Anyone else considering a move to Montana?!
2020-03-18 21:07:00,"I don't understand the numbers:

The latest data from China say that 86% of infected were either asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms.   That is almost certainly an UNDERestimation, since there is no way of knowing the true number of those who were asymptomatic.

The table at the end of this article assumes a hospitalization rate of >20%.  Note even everyone who had more than mild symptoms needs to be hospitalized.  I had a few pretty bad respiratory infections, likely the flu, several times during my life and I never had to be hospitalized.  Those were definitely not 'mild' infections.  

So I think that there is more elasticity in the system.  The bottleneck will be the patients who need respirators.  And those are the ones who definitely need to be hospitalized."
2020-03-18 20:16:53,A lot of smart people are being let go. Time to start training them immediately.
2020-03-18 21:13:37,"Thank you for stating the sources and assumptions clearly. The 19% hospitalization rate is a critical factor. You appear to source this from the Chinese CDC study (based on 14% ""severe"" and 5% ""critical"" cases...they never say they were hospitalized explicitly, but that seems reasonable). But many factors may impact these numbers and estimates else where show a broad range 5% on Penn model (<a href=""http://penn-chime.phl.io"" target=""_blank"">http://penn-chime.phl.io</a>/) based on current rates, when conditioned for age in UK, a spread but under 10% for people < 50 yrs old <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-hospitalisation-rates-revealed-80-per-cent-infected"" target=""_blank"">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-hospitalisation-rates-revealed-80-per-cent-infected</a>/) ....and reports from Italy of much, much higher (although nothing i've seen conditioned on age / underlying conditions).

This is important analysis so please continue! It would help to amplify these rates (infected, hospitalized, ICU, CFR, etc) with more data from more diverse populations as it comes in."
2020-03-18 21:04:48,"These are terrifying numbers, however, it's the New York Times' responsibility as an organization to provide proper context.

Given what we know now, how likely is each of the scenarios?  How likely is it for each of these cases if all of the US is sheltering in place?  Or if we test quickly and comprehensively? Or start tracing more effectively?

Also, these scenarios do not resemble what we're seeing in China or South Korea or Taiwan.  China is well past peak cases and has had 0.008% of the population confirmed infected.  There are very few new cases.  Presumably, with draconian controls, they can also avoid future outbreaks.

While there's a good chance the US might not be able to control spread as well as China did, there's a chance we can learn and act.  The US may not stay under 0.008%, but that's still a far cry from 20%.

If you're going to publish an article where the best case is 20%, please provide proper context."
2020-03-18 20:43:20,"I am a Korean and I thought Korea was responding well in the early days.  Super infection broke out in ""Shincheonji"" scaringly saying that the government was in an end phase.  Corona19's infectious power is beyond imagination.  Korea is shrinking, but small group infections are still spreading.  In that case, even a single contact infects millions of people.  We are more careful because we have experienced it.  Corona's greatest fear is its propagation power, and it also re-infects.  We are spontaneously distanced from people because it is scary.  If Korea had known it from the beginning, the number of infected people would have been much less than now.  I hope you don't make the same mistake as us.  More than I thought, it's good to keep in mind that Corona's infectivity is beyond imagination."
2020-03-18 20:39:40,"Interesting that this crisis wasn't Trump's responsibility until he figured out that he could give himself a big tax cut and get a $1,000 check to boot and, oh, an interest-free loan from the US Government, don't you think? Lucky guy."
2020-03-18 20:17:39,"It's not that these comments aren't serious, even thoughtful.  (Mostly.)  But I saw no one remark on the thing that jumped out at me.  What I zeroed in on was the timelines ... 6 months, 12 months, 18 months.  Is this now what we're dealing with?  And not 2 months?  Or five?  

Without an explanation of this, my anxiety level just ratcheted up some.  Anybody?"
2020-03-18 20:02:45,"You know the problem with stats....they apply only to groups of people and depend on numbers that vary with time.  The real issue is this: as an individual, you will either get sick and need to be hospitalized or not.  

So, when trying to determine whether to self isolate, remain locked down, work from home, close or transform your in-person to a take-out/delivery/on-line business or not, ""You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky.""   

Facts: 1) Covid-19 is a contagious infection. 2) You are likely spreading the virus for 24-48 hours before you become ill. 3) The virus remains airborne for maybe as long as 30 minutes after you cough in a room and walk out.  

Now, before you answer the question about feeling lucky or not, remember that you are also answering for your family, your co-workers and their families, your customers and their families, the first responders and their families, the health care workers and their families and the people showing up to their essential jobs to sell you your hand sanitizer, food and toilet paper.

If your answer is ""I don't care, I feel lucky"", then you should also let everyone you know that if you become sick, you are refusing hospital admission and ventilation care.  You cannot have it both ways.  This is no longer a NIMBY issue."
2020-03-18 19:59:13,"So the takeaway is that if we hit a worst-case scenario with infections..things..will get bad? I don't think we need to present maps of the country on fire together with scary-looking (false precision) stats to make that point. 

If 40% of the country (99M) becomes simultaneously infected, resulting in 21M hospitalizations...AND hospitals somehow don't figure out that they need to ratchet up capacity...well then yeah it would obviously overwhelm the hospital system...and this might be the least of our concerns.  

I don't think we need reporting like this right now and not sure how it supports the public good. Please help us with information that is actionable / useful for society today. We're all on edge."
2020-03-18 21:53:36,"The issues we are facing now are so massive and unprecedented that one could never carry out a controlled study sufficient to evaluate all the relevant variables, or, probably, pay for the capacities needed to handle them. There is science we can and should apply, but this may be a situation where the limits of science press hard up against the boundaries of wisdom and common sense.

I have some relatives in Germany, one of whom is a baker, another a tv repairman, another an auto-parts worker. Beyond their main jobs, they all farm some small fields they have. When it's potato season, there is a big box in the basement - enough for a couple of months. They keep ducks, for eggs and occasional eating. They grow apples, plums and hazelnuts, they built most of their own super-insulated home themselves, and feed their computer-controlled wood-fired heater with wood from their local trees. You get the picture.

Perhaps we're all in this crisis largely because we expect our government and healthcare system to be able to handle a situation that is inevitably beyond its capacity. Maybe the reason that the case fatality rate is so much lower in Germany is because they don't expect this as much.

Whenever this crisis is past, maybe part of our attention should go towards educating people, especially children, about how to think about, create and live in ecosystems which, like the rest of nature, are no dependent on massively scaled crisis responses that are always going to be inadequate."
2020-03-18 22:02:51,"I think we've run all the numbers we need to make rational decisions. Now it's time for action. The is not a zero-sum game. We can create temporary hospitals, increase production of ventilators, and train people how to use them. We've done this many times before in times of war. It's just a leadership issue at this stage."
2020-03-18 22:16:38,"I can appreciate the validity of this statistical analysis in terms of the projected shortage of beds at various infection rates.

But it doesn't address the quality of care itself.

Some of the areas shown to have considerable bed capacity until very high rates of infection occur are not exactly places with quality physicians and nurses.

Isn't quality of care at least as important as quantity of bed space?"
2020-03-18 22:41:39,In times like these it is important that we all manage our stress the best way that we can to ensure our overall health. My concern is that thousands of medical professionals are over worked an facing tremendous stress. Are there programs set in place for them to consul with psychologists?
2020-03-18 23:34:45,"A very useful projection would be how long various quarantines, social distancing and shutdowns will need to be enforced to keep infection rates below the number of hospital beds and ventilators.

THAT projection will indicate the effect on the US and global economy, and to be honest, it will be a lot longer and harder than many people think."
2020-03-18 23:41:17,"I'm not doubting the numbers.  I just lack the imagination, I guess, to believe the dire prognosis for our country.  What I saw today with my own eyes was a beautiful spring-like day with people around their houses, and also visibly distant from one another yet walking the streets and parks in large numbers.  Stores and malls in Portland area were largely empty--desolate.  Restaurants were closed but gas stations open.  My grandchildren were outdoors playing ""cruise ship"" and yelling for room service to bring them ice cream (nope, too close to dinner).  The Dow was crashing below 20,000 but the Treasury is readying delivery of $1,000 checks(?).  And now this startling ""bed research.""  Frankly, I'm overwhelmed."
2020-03-19 00:31:30,"This is an overshot. I've read the methodology, and these numbers rely exclusively on Chinese data for the hospitalization rate (20%). The Chinese mortality rate is an overestimate due to not all infected being accounted for - that is the consensus among experts. This is because people with mild cases are not going in to get tested at overwhelmed hospitals that are full of the virus. Only the sickest people are coming to hospitals and therefore getting tested. Thus, it stands to reason that the hospitalization rate is skewed upward because only the sickest people are even getting tested. I'll change my tune if we get hospitalization rate data out of Korea.

Additionally, the lowball 20% infection rate is what we experienced during the swine flu epidemic in 2009. Swine flu was highly contagious and practiced zero social distancing. I'd imagine we'll be able to do better than that, despite this virus being probably more infection than swine flue."
2020-03-19 00:45:57,"What we really need to know is the hospitalization rate by age. There is no question that young people can get really sick, the CDC data shows that. But in what proportion? If only a small fraction of younger people who come down with the flu require hospital care, then we may possibly be able to get by with a far more rational set of measures. Measures that actually allow people to work and the economy to move along. That will do more good than any stimulus package."
2020-03-18 21:30:09,"What is that you say? We don't have enough hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators, doctors, nurses, masks, gowns, testing kits, swabs or anything else that will be needed to keep people alive during this epidemic? 

Thank god our far sighted leaders have been spending most of our money on the military for the last several decades. Those aircraft carriers, nuclear missiles and F35s are going to be really useful in the coming days! Hurrah for us! USA! USA!"
2020-03-18 21:59:56,"Hmmm ... haven't seen graphics like this anywhere on Fox News. Is that because 

(a) it would terrify the ""Trump Red Zone"" (notably, in WI and other strongholds in the plains""; or 

(b) percentages and projections and such are just too much math for those folks to handle intelligently?

If (b), we seriously need some crash courses in probability and ratios instead of Fox hosts bloviating about Dem hoaxes."
2020-03-18 22:17:50,"WRONG STUDY. Analyze ICU beds per 10,000. That's the statistic that correlates most highly to death rates.  Hospital beds in total are useless for understanding mortality rate. ICU beds gives you a feel for # of ventilators."
2020-03-18 22:53:01,"It would seem that the US should take another lesson from China and launch a massive temporary hospital construction project. 

If they can pull that off, so can we. 

This is the equivalent of a war. We should treat it as such. Tighten our belts, roll up our sleeves and get this done. We brag incessantly about American exceptionalism. Will we measure up? This is not a test, it's the real thing. We have the resources and ability to handle this. It is up to all, but mostly to our political and economic elites."
2020-03-19 00:10:35,These estimates are confusing   Are we saying that the United States is the least capable nation for handling the C-19 virus or are you saying that we can expect between these percentages across the population of most of the countries in the world?     That is a very frightening thought.    Basically you're saying that worldwide we currently have a known CV-19 infection count of somewhere over 200k infected and somewhere over 8k deaths.   And we expect this to rise to 40 percent of the adults in the world (in your moderate example).    That's over a billion infections and 20 million dead in the world depending on the definition of an adult.   I hope you're wrong because otherwise we've got a worse year coming than most are expecting.
2020-03-19 02:17:46,"Shouldn't we be starting classes, right now, using online classes  as much as possible until teaching absolutely has to move to hands-on practice, to get some younger, lower-risk people trained in the basics of running a respirator?  I don't mean at all to minimize the skill and training of respiratory therapists, but if they could be spread thinner by utilizing crash-course graduates under their supervision, wouldn't that be better than nothing?  By the time more machines finally come off the production lines, we'd have  people to staff them.  Pay them to train, and then, when this is over, pay them an annual stipend to take refresher classes to maintain their skills so we have them in reserve for the next time."
2020-03-19 01:04:35,"I don't understand why we're talking about 6, 12, and 18-month timeframes when China essentially halted the spread of COVID-19 within 2 months. 

I'm trying to square the Harvard analysis with this March 16th headline from UN News: ""China shows COVID-19 Coronavirus can be ‘stopped in its tracks’"". 

It doesn't add up."

2020-03-19 09:03:13,"Perhaps hospitals could, also, return to using the licensed practical nurses, also called licensed vocational nurses, that so many hospitals dispensed with over the years. They are licensed to do almost all of the clinical practices the registered nurse is licensed to perform and have always been and would be an invaluable resource."
2020-03-19 07:32:17,My husband and I are in our 80s and we are in lockdown in our village. For the last ten years we have had our food delivered to the kitchen (with frozen produce put in the freezer if we're not there) from a local grocery store. This family has struggled for years against the two big supermarkets near us. I have often mentioned this grocer to other people but I was always told he was too expensive.  Now everyone is calling him up for deliveries. He's an aimable man who took over his father's shop and understood years ago that delivery was vital for his commerce. Now that is paying off thanks to the virus. But I still think the new clients are hypocrites.
2020-03-19 13:12:37,"There's far too little information about how they selected 20%, 40%, and 60% infection rates given the importance of those assumptions.

No country has come anywhere remotely close to that level. Known cases in China are roughly 0.0006% of their population. Italy is 0.06% of their population. Even if there are huge amounts of untested positives--5x confirmed, 10x, etc.--we're still talking 1-2%.

I get that the number of cases will continue to grow significantly as testing occurs, but to 40% or 60% given the measures taken?

Based on a quick Google search of the researcher, he seems to have made those estimates over two weeks ago, long before major cities started hunkering down, travel was essentially banned, etc.

Though the hospital bed data seems solid, I'm extremely skeptical of the infection assumptions and those drive the whole model. 

How does this look if infection rates are 1%, 5%, or 10%?"

2020-03-19 19:42:34,"Hospital beds and space are a concern, but what many commenters fail to recognize is that health care providers and equipment, too, are needed.

Many doctors/nurses/etc are not willing to come in, for risk of contracting the virus themselves and infecting at-risk family members. Others will contract the virus. The medical system is strapped right now in many areas, and the virus hasn't even hit 5% of the population.

The U.S. lacks enough medical equipment or safety equipment to properly deal with the crisis. Even if we get a random university down (suggested by someone else), or open a public space to create more beds, we won't be able to properly care for that many people. This is truly a crisis."

2020-03-20 01:44:58,Testing for everyone would solve alot of problems understanding who already has had it and is now immune and can help out on the front lines.  It would tell those who have it to stay home and cordoned off from everyone for 14 or 21 days. The stupidity of not cranking out these tests everywhere they can is just unbelievably shortsighted and stupid.  The feds should be buying them overseas if they are too inept to get them made here in time.
2020-03-20 04:04:04,"There are about 235,000 students in the U.S. studying for a 4-yr B.S. (or comparable) nursing degree.

Why can’t we ask those who have successfully completed 3 years  to volunteer to work in our hospitals in exchange for 1/2 of the credit they need to complete their fourth year degree program?

Often, their 4th year is mostly focused upon preparing them for their RN exam -- but the required basic nursing knowledge has already been mastered and, consequently, some significant percentage of those 235,000 students could provide surge capacity for things like giving COVID-19 tests, monitoring patient status and taking vital stats, giving injections and administering meds prescribed by doctors or Nurse Practitioners, responding to emergency situations, starting IV's, plus all other basic nurse functions.

Perhaps (as an incentive) in addition to giving them course credit toward their degree, the federal and state governments could also jointly cover (rebate) the cost of the 4th year tuition/fees for those senior-year students who agree to participate?

Lastly, we might also want to look into what might be done to offer something similar to LVN and LPN students who have completed most of their nursing education."
2020-03-20 16:41:23,"You have nothing learned from China and Europe! Think in ICU beds not in hospital beds! Check again how long a patient needs a hospital bed!  Check it out and then get afraid, very afraid, because the US did not prepare as well as Europe did. You will have more deaths than needed, just because you did not check out how the other countries did.. you are behind the facts! This is going to be humantarian desaster! New York has 5673 patients in treatment today, that will be more than 15000 next week. You only have 3000 ICU beds in New York. Why dit the New York Times not investigate very well and inform the people before a desaster can happen? Journalism is freedom of speach and the resposibility to inform the people in a right way.

2020-03-23 04:36:11,"Thank you for supplying the numbers that show the United States is amply prepared to handle the rates of infection. We even have enough ICU beds currently available to take care of the 10,000 people around the world in critical condition. In order for the system to be overwhelmed, 2 million adults are assumed to need an icu bed over the next 6 months. Based on the current numbers, rate of infection, and common sense, that’s nearly impossible... and that’s the most ‘conservative estimate’."
2020-03-23 22:17:03,I wonder how turnover in hospital beds is factored in these statistics.  How long does it take a person with serious corona infection to become well enough to go home and resume life?
2020-03-25 11:59:44,"I am a former ICU Nurse and my message is this: Government leaders need to wrap their heads around a constraint that they cannot change fast enough: it isn't about getting enough ventilators! Once a person is on a vent, their Acid/Base balance, Renal and Heart function,  requires about 10-15 highly trained ICU Nurses, Resp Therapists, ICU Fellows per week to keep them alive( even splitting 12 hours shifts and working OT ) AND most ICU Nurses are over 50 years old and we are running out of PPE.14 &% of ICU MD's and Nurses could be lost to the virus.
    We must shift to outpatient treatment with the new drugs in compassionate use trial : Factories should be ordered to mass produce those drugs, as well as PPE . 
Taking those meds at home is FAR cheaper and will save lives. The American Health System has been bankrupted by the Insurance Industry, we do not have the Nurses, the sedation drugs to keep people on vents, the IV Nutrition or even the PPE.
Stay Home, treat at home and get realistic NOW"
2020-03-30 02:25:39,"Any normal administration would issue a plan to the American public in writing.  

It would include the various models you show in this article on a spreadsheet and match them with how many masks, shields and ventilators to anticipate needing on week 1, 2, 3 etc.  The spreadsheet would then include quantities and delivery dates of stock, stored, donated, imported, and newly manufactured equipment corresponding to those periods and needs.  It would list the individual vendors and their anticipated weekly production quantities and delivery times.  

It would expose where the actual gaps are and where we need to do better.  We understand that not knowing which of the models to anticipate (please, more testing) means that the match of early projections and fulfillment of those needs could be off by enormous percentages.  

These inevitable miscalculations would be forgivable as they would at least be based on thought, documentation, caring and transparency, and not on a series of disconnected rambling statements and promises that the President specializes in.  I don't need to watch a telethon with donor announcements, or buy a condo that we are being told is going to be ready really soon and very ""beautiful.""  Just give us the facts in an organized fashion and we might have more confidence in the administration.

2020-04-20 21:51:14,This is 20 days old but it was nothing but fear at the time it was written. The number I see floating around says we have more ventilators the people to run them. That by far is a bigger problem. We can make ventilators. The amount of face masks being used is hard to understand. There has to be some other problem if they are short.

Everyone else recovers and we’re ready to get back to business by the end of 2020, probably with some fine profit opportunities for well-placed carpetbaggers.  

(2) With great effort to contain the outbreak, the U.S. is looking at far fewer dead, a much longer duration of (probably deeper) economic and social distress for the 99%, a longer period of potential social unrest directed at government, and less-certain opportunity for carpetbaggers once the dust does clear.

But the manner in which you published it will tend to sow fear and panic, especially among those who don't understand the underlying details and planning assumptions.

Or maybe the business of someone who donated a few million to his campaign. Those are the only Americans he wants to help -- people who share his desire to rip off the country any way he can. The only reason he is acting now is because it has been sharply brought home to him that Americans are actually DYING because of his incompetence. Our only consolation at this point is knowing that, as soon as he loses to Joe Biden, he will be in handcuffs and on trial for his criminal and treasonous actions against American citizens and our country."

“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”

Locker room banter. If you watched his last two news conference, you'd think he has been the far-seeming statesman, doing the ultimate to protect Americans. Now he did early bar travelers from China. He never ceases to brag on himself because of that. It was Trumpian thing to do -- keep out strange-looking aliens. But his concern with the economy and his re-election has always trumped his humanistic impulses. Whenever he starts to brag on himself at a press gathering, I don't know why reporters don't call him out by simply reading the above tweet, and the date it was tweeted.

In China, I saw a four block area cleared, trucks and more than a dozen cranes working. They said they were building a hospital that would shelter thousands and it would be done in about a week. They did it! Would it be impossible for the USA to mobilize like that? Among of things, we could divert resources away from building the Wall."

2020-03-18 18:16:29,"After listening to Donald Trump’s press conference this morning, it is clear that Trump is planning to stoke fear and hatred against China for the COVID-19 Crisis. Moreover, Trump does not care if Asian Americans receive the brunt of the fear and hatred from follow Americans. Indeed, Trump seems to welcome any and all scapegoating long as it take away from his incompetent and disastrous leadership.

Asian Americans—along with other Americans—must rise up and collectively reject Trump’s dastardly attempt to race-bait his way out of blame in this time of crisis. The Federal Plan must address the importance of national unity and racial solidarity, and it must reject racial division and scapegoating. Asian Americans are dramatically over-representated in healthcare fields as doctors and nurses, and these healthcare professionals must stand up and demand Trump and his administration stop using terms that stoke racial hostility and divide the nation. Asian Americans cannot keep silent as the Trump turns the nation against them while depending them to provide medical care to keep American alive. All Americans should speak clearly and loudly to show this president and this administration that we will tolerate racism in this moment of monumental crisis that demands all Americans to unite."

Watch for growing interference with the nomination process of the opposing party and an attempt to delay and defer the presidential and other national legislative election to preserve a Republican Senate and Trump as chief executive.  The political damage to the Constitution of the United States will be much greater and more permanent than any economic damage.

2020-03-18 18:08:02,"Trump is now a self-declared ""wartime President"" of the war on the coronavirus.

This is a tactic, and it is a tactic dangerous to the hopes of Democrats. 

The US has a history of re-electing Presidents with good economies, and not re-electing Presidents with troubled economies.

However, the US also has a history of re-electing wartime Presidents. FDR found such support in 1942 even before the first US offensive moves against Germany in the Torch invasion, which came after the election. That was when the Japanese had grabbed the Pacific and the Germans were still torpedoing everything along the US coast.

If the ""war"" on the virus goes at all well, even a little better than the current worst case fears being spread, then Trump might find strength from that.

Certainly, he seems to think so."
2020-03-18 18:26:37,"The American government has a pretty abysmal record of dealing with catastrophic emergencies.  Just take a look at Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, and many, many other examples.  We are long way off from the days of WWII when automobile factories were repurposed to make tanks.  We really need to snap into high gear since Trump dragged his feet during critical weeks.  We need bold action, NOW!"
2020-03-18 18:06:20,"Trump should be doing the following, now:

-use Defense Production Act to have factories produce necessary health protection equipment, test kits, and anything else to test folks, treat folks, and limit the spread of the virus; and

- get vaccination research and development fast tracked, now.

Why is he telling governors to do all this and get all this on their own?

In the absence of Presidential leadership on this emergency, the Democratic Governors need to band together and do all of these things. And if republican governors want to join in, fine. California, NY and Washington State all have the technology and resources to get this done, and other governors can provide funding and resources as needed. 

Together, the states can do the work the federal government should be doing but is not doing. And together, states can protect the citizens of our nation."
2020-03-18 18:53:31,"The country would be much better off if the federal, state and local government leaders were completely open and frank about the measures being taken and why and what they are intended to accomplish. Most of today's existing fiats are directed not at preventing disease so much as at flattening the demand curve for hospital services, particularly ICUs. While an 18-month scenario may be a worst-case prediction, we won't know how valid such predictions are until at least July or August.  So eschew the pronunciamentos and tell it like it is. I know it's hard for Trump, wedded as he is to his own version of facts, but everyone else is capable of being honest with the American people, and should do so."

The key is to read the planning assumptions, which include worst case scenarios, because we don't really know how this will play out. The assumptions in the plan include the pandemic lasting 18 months and that there will be shortages of medical supplies. If we address this now head on, perhaps those worst case scenarios will never play out. But you gotta love the headline. Sure got me to read the article."
2020-03-18 19:08:55,"This story is misleading. The plan did not warn policymakers that a pandemic ""will last 18 months or longer."" Instead, it made a ""planning assumption"" ""in the absence of facts"" that the pandemic will last 18 months or longer. There's a big difference."

Although no one wants a problem like the SARS-COV2, when it first blew up I thought that a positive byproduct would that the citizens of our country would come together as one, much like we did after 9/11. I only hope that many of those who write comments here at NYT are not representative of the rest of the country.

2020-03-18 19:40:57,"What irkes me the most is the refusal to test ""healthy"" people. Testing only sick individuals (those with COVID 19 symptoms) doesn't give the true picture of the morbidity and mortality caused by the virus. In addition, the size of our country and the difference in population density may play a significant role in viral spread.

The Orange Menace hopes for ""low numbers"", so he can boast about the wonderful job he did by having less positive cases than China, Italy etc. He is too dumb to realize that the virus caused mortality will be quite high, since the number of asymptomatic but infected people is not known. It is assumed to be 80%, but who are  these 80%?  Urban and suburban areas? Rural areas? Communities with younger population? Warmer or colder climate? Young, old, very young or very old?
The good news is that South Korea is starting to provide some of these data, thanks to their aggressive testing. Similar data will also be coming from Europe."

This country is going into uncharted territory and we are in the same boat.  We can come out of this stronger but also torn apart by unresolvable social divisions made clear by mass riots, disorder, violence. 

The reality is that there has been no replacement for government since we left the hunter gatherer Mesolithic age.  

We have to mature as a society and we can no longer afford candidates or presidents who run on an anti-government platform.  We need candidates, mayors, governors, and presidents who can run the government better and on occasion leaner and more intelligently  There is no replacement for government in many realities such as we face today."

How can a nation send their most valuable asset into the fray without the test kits, the N95, masks, the respirators, the ventilators, and the ICU beds?  That is the situation confronting my son and the entire nation's health care community.  The dithering by Trump in not only invoking, but then failing to implement immediately the Defense Production Act is a national disgrace and a ""clear and present danger"" both to our health care professionals and their patients whose lives are on the line.

As a frightened senior, self-isolating at home and glued to the world and national news, I have to change channels whenever the president speaks.

2020-03-18 21:58:40,"I guess Trump has no idea how long it takes to change gears from say auto manufacturing over to respirator manufacturing and PPE gear.  

It takes time to get parts and equipment in place to even begin production, not to mention training workers on how to put those things together.   It doesn't happen in 5 minutes, more like 5 weeks or longer.

Meanwhile back in 2005 US HHS had developed a pandemic study which identified this very scenario and made recommendations. Many public health depts at the state level, and also within CDC, have been planning and thinking about pandemic events for some time. This document looks like it was hastily put together, has some ridiculous looking charts that are meaningless, and are full of recommendations that most public health graduate students could make. It gives an appearance of taking decisive action, when decisive action was needed months ago. Millions of American lives are now at stake because of utterly incompetent and craven leadership."
2020-03-19 00:28:15,"Perhaps ardent Trump supporters can contemplate how much greater America is when they are waiting in line for critical healthcare, with no medication, no hospital beds, no ventilators, and they are possibly ill with COVID-19."
2020-03-19 00:42:01,"The pandemic does not need to last 18 months. Information released today reported that the virus can live for 2 to 3 days on steel and plastic. Think HVAC system. On the cruise ships; in nursing homes. I have been urging public health departments in Seattle, the states of Washington and Massachusetts, and the CDC to consider this possibility. No response.

Yes, the way the pandemic is being handled it may take 18 months and thousands of lives. But the one intervention that could make a difference won't even get mentioned in the US. Total lock down of the country like Italy is doing. We may see improvement there in the next couple of weeks. 

The theory is, enforce rigid quarantine for everyone like in China which seems to have turned the corner. No contact - no transmission of the virus. If that happens, instead of the virus being transmitted to a new person every 2 or 3 days, the chain of transmission ends with that original infected patient. Possibly in 2 or 3 life cycles of the virus it could be gone.

If that did not work, nothing would be lost. If it does work, the epidemic will be short lived (a couple of months), the economy can get back to normal, thousands of lives will be saved and we will not have to spend trillions of dollars dealing with the problem.

This worked in China. We will find out soon if it is working in Italy. We should not hesitate to implement a real ""battle plan""."
2020-03-19 02:26:45,"I understand infection/ transmission  rates. I understand mortality  as a percentage of affected population.  I  understand that the difference between reasonable precautions to protect from infection,  and suppression of civil liberties is by no means clear, and either way we choose, lives will be lost.
I also understand  how the instinct of politicians is to grasp power to deal with the exigencies of a crisis without consideration for the future.  
This crisis will pass.   The actions taken in the name of public safety - cancelling elections, prohibiting public gatherings, restricting economic activity - are not distinguishable from the actions of a tyrannical state except for our perception of intent.
This is of course not the last such crisis we face in an increasingly connected world. We do not know how long the current health crisis will last.  We had better be willing to accept the burden of individual responsibility for our mutual safety than tolerating  the dictates of governments controlling our actions in the name of safety."
2020-03-19 02:48:30,18 months?! Why has China basically solved it in 2 months? Apparently today was the first day China had no new cases. So how does China do it in 2 months and we're going to take 18? Absolutely ridiculous and Trump needs to go.

And then it was easier to just search for Peter Baker's name than to troll through the very crowded homepage.
Granted, as @John in LA pointed out, 18 monthis is just silly in view of China's great job getting to 0 new cases in 2 months -- even after a slow start. But even at the risk of scaring the children it might be a good idea for more people to see this information."

Both follow the same path:   1.  denial of facts;  (2) false equivalence with irrelevant problems  (e.g., normal flu or bad weather); (3) treatment of the problem as a grievance, accessorized by resentment of the respectable media.   The saddest part is that immediate deaths by a large number of people seem to be necessary to focus Trump's mind, whereas a larger number of deaths decades from now are easily ignored."

I've received word that ER doctors at Kaiser in Oakland CA are now using only 1 mask per day in order to ration their supplies. Would it be possible to urge the hoarders and folks with extra supplies to donate or sell some of their supplies to hospitals and other front line workers?

As if refitting a plant, particularly to FDA specifications, and ramping up production for something as precise as medical ventilators, could be done “very quickly.”

The man doesn’t have a clue and we will all pay the price.

2020-03-19 14:37:58,"I have been a student of capital formation for most of my professional life. It has been presciently observed that, by education, experience, and culture, most of humanity thinks and acts in linear, rather than exponential, terms. The resulting inequality in the distribution of wealth and income in favor of those who manipulate the price-clearing mechanisms of the markets according to a non-linear metric has been broadly characterized as the “financialization” of our globally interconnected and interdependent society. Because that metric has been, for the most part, orderly and moderate, the resulting inequalities, though massive, have been made tolerable through state intervention (basically through taxation and the provision of a social safety net). Covid-19 is a self-learning viral process with an exponentially explosive, rather than moderate, growth curve. It remains to be seen whether state action can deal with the resulting new paradigm that defies the traditional price-clearing market mechanisms. When supply and demand and costs are non-linear, the only solutions are of biblical proportions reflected in “free money” and the “Jubilee” of debt forgiveness. I fear that the linear mentality of our politicians will not be up to task until Chaos dictates the terms of Her own resolution."
2020-03-19 14:54:25,"Whatever the plan states about the future, the devastation of the Coronavirus on all levels is real and will continue into the next Presidential term. 

In my opinion, having a president who has experienced personal tragedy  and the heartbreak and  empathy that result from it will be an important qualification. Biden has empathy because he lost his wife and daughter to a tragic accident and in later life his son to brain cancer.  No amount of ""spin"" can make a candidate empathetic and wise because of the suffering he or  she  has experienced and learned from in life.

We all may be facing a time of uncertainty and loss due to consequences of this pandemic so we need a leader who can help us not  through  not with empty rhetoric but honest hope forged in living through personal pain to see the light of each new day.

Like Biden, I am 77 and lost a son to brain cancer. I live with that pain but it also has made me wiser,  more empathetic,  and even hopeful. As my late son wrote before he died  in 2007 at at 19: ""The sky is bright with tender hope."""
2020-03-19 15:14:46,"I'm thankful that the Administration almost immediately imposed travel restrictions from China and quarantines when news of the virus broke.

Also - How about posting the instructions and materials on how to make a medical grade mask?  The folks who are sewing those masks in Washington might consider sharing that information.  Or you, NYT writer, might consider a follow up piece pointing us that information. 

Please consider. It could save more lives."
2020-03-20 06:04:21,"The Washington Post did a story about a mask manufacturer in Texas who has been warning about the dependence on China since the Obama years. Neither the Obama nor the Trump administration took him seriously.  Shame on both of them, and shame on us all if continue to allow our dependence on Chinese manufacturing.  Some things are more important than the discounts allowed by cheap labor."

The Department of Heath and Human Services, which oversees the stockpile, did not return emails requesting information about the supplies. The department has estimated that the country would need 3.5 billion masks in the event of a pandemic lasting a year.” 

Two points. One, I bet we will find that the above statement is inaccurate. My guess is the reserves have been squandered. There is no other possible reason as to why the government is not releasing these “stockpiled” items. Two, is there a way for everyday citizens to make masks?  Many of us can sew. What materials do we need and how do we do it?"
2020-03-20 06:12:30,"Well:  people and restless teens/college kids in search of a project might consider calling/emailing all 50 States' Congressional Representatives and Senators and making these demands, as identifed by Dr Mell and the American College of Emergency Physicians:

1) Ramp up production of medical gear eg ventilators and supplies eg N95 respirator masks, gowns, face sheilds, goggles, through the Defense Production Act powers

2) Increase distributions from the Strategic National Stockpile, a repository of critical medical supplies for public health emergencies

Or maybe Jeff Bezos and the billionaire class will help out.

If we have learned nothing else from this mess, I hope we have learned that it is worth the investment of time and resources and expertise to have solidly staffed and supplied government agencies ready to go in a crisis.  

It should now be starkly clear that depending on the free market to solve all of our problems is inappropriate.  The free market will never be about the common good; that is what government is for."

The sterile process has collapsed. Healthcare workers will undoubtedly become the reservoir."

Everyday government officials say that they are on their way that they should get them tomorrow. But the next day they either didn’t get it or the amount they got was totally inadequate. Last night, I switched to German news : same thing. I want to scream at these politicians who decided a few years ago to not renew the reserves of protective gear to save a ridiculous amount of money when you compare it to other government expenses. But the images of medical staff desperately trying to save people despite the lack of gear, risking their own lives because they are wearing inadequate gear makes me want to cry. They are heroes."
2020-03-20 08:33:45,"The fact that there is an unnecessary loss of innocent lives of physicians, nurses and subsequent patients -- when the medical personnel survive, but are sidelined and cannot help infected people for weeks – just because the caregivers cannot get the proper masks to wear is incredible.

The fact that the proper masks exist and are sitting in warehouses owned by the federal government is outrageous.

Instead of effective action and leadership, we have to endure the flippancy and sarcasm of the self-absorbed man child in the White House. His response to the crisis: “The federal government’s not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,” Mr. Trump said. “You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.”

History will not be kind to Donald Trump and the Republican apologists for his conduct. Comeuppance, however, will come only after thousands or tens of thousands of Americans have perished."
2020-03-20 08:39:09,"What I would have liked to see in this report is WHY and what’s next. Have you identified companies that manufacture these masks and equipment? What are they doing? What do the supply chains look like? How fast are more coming? What does 3M day about ramping up manufacturing? (They are a producer of N95 masks). Are these businesses running production lines 24/7? (Italy provided engineering staff from its army to an Italian company that manufactures respirators so they can operate 3 shifts / day.) A chip manufacturer in South Korea converted its clean room to manufacture hospital equipment; is Intel considering the same?

That medical staff don’t have adequate protective equipment is a story that’s at least a week old and is completely predicted by China and Italy. 

What I want to know is what’s being done to solve the problem."
2020-03-20 08:41:11,"We establish contingency for disruption in many other areas. Why a ""Strategic Petroleum Reserve?"" Why ""Critical Minerals Stockpiles? "" Because there can be disruption of commerce and we need to be self-sufficient during the disruption. There are no shortages of bullets for police and our military, in fact no shortage at all of wares with which to kill others and no lack of domestic capacity to produce them. No one suggests that we outsource these parts of our nation's security overseas. 

So WHY are there no pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities for common medicines needed daily from aspirins to antibiotics and why are there not stockpiles of masks, respirators and protective gear in preparation for a disruption? Did the politicians of either party care enough for the well-being of citizens to even consider that citizens are the reason ""to provide for the common defense?"" They were too busy falling all over each in helping corporations to move these critical facilities for national security out of the country so the companies could profit from cheap labor and avoid taxation."

What good are all the economic stimulus measures, if doctors are at great risk and patients are dying?
Who will be left to fly on the bailed out airlines planes?
WHAT is going on in this country when Trump says the federal government is not a shipping clerk to disseminate supplies that the states should procure?
Most of the states who are seeing severe shortages send much more in revenue to the federal government than they get back.

2020-03-20 08:46:37,"My wife asked me to find masks from anywhere I can. Right now it’s impossible. Even expensive electronic filtering systems are sold out. We had no idea the hospital she works at did not have a secure supply of this basic protective equipment, and that they didn’t even have PPE to cover their eyes.

It’s even harder to comprehend how incompetent leadership has been in this country. The president was briefed on covid 19 3 and a half months ago. I’m glad he has been able to find time to continue his Twitter wars."
2020-03-20 09:02:24,"I am a nurse.  We only have the paper surgical masks on our unit.  We do not have any N95 masks.  Why is the stockpile not being distributed?  

This virus is going to highlight the shortcomings of a for profit health care system.  Right now our health care system seems to exist as a front to funnel money from the poor and middle class to the rich. It certainly isn't protecting our patients from infection and those who care for them."
2020-03-20 09:41:46,"This is the problem with Sanders casting health care as a ""right"". It's not a right if it means someone else has to risk their own life for you. There are other good reasons to have single payer healthcare (easier to regulate, economies of scale, etc) but the facile argument that health care is a right ain't one of them."

2020-03-20 10:17:23,"We've know for the last century that a new virulent airborne infectious agent could be diabolically effective by quickly incapacitating the health care providers.  There's no excuse for the world's governments not having ""gamed this out"" long ago and maintained adequate reserve supplies of the cheapest primary defense: PPE.
Whether ""natural"" or helped along by modern germ warfare science, we had to know that, like a runaway fission reaction, a new infectious agent could quickly overwhelm our healthcare systems by taking our front line defenses: the healthcare workers."
2020-03-20 11:03:19,"While part of the solution will have to be mass production of PPE, we should also look at potential for reuse. Instead of throwing away used PPE and other scarce medical necessities, collect them somewhere and get a bunch of people to work on finding ways to sterilize them.

It is simply implausible that these things cannot be sterilized and reused. The obvious options are heat, UV-light, steam, or chemicals. This could solve shortages of everything from ventilator masks, to PPE, to the plastic used in the test kits."

We have become the people we used to pity. Now, look at us, we're pitiful."

2020-03-20 08:18:08,"The criminal negligence exhibited by Trump and the Federal government's failure to protect Americans must have repercussions.

Trump's insistence that he stated all along that the threat of the epidemic was real is easily proved a lie with the videotape of his more than a month of denials as a Democratic and media hoax. 

While the number of dead isn't known yet what's sure is that Trump should face trial for criminal negligence with hours of videotape as proof. His amateurish performance since he has acknowledged the epidemic may not be prosecutable but it should be denounced publicly and frequently.

He should then be removed from office and sent to prison for dereliction of duty."

2020-03-20 08:58:48,"In May 2015, as Ebola raged, Bill Gates gave a talk forecasting that the next big war will be against a disease. He had many practical suggestions, including a reserve medical corps, war-game-like simulations, stockpiles of equipment, and more. 

In 2016, a stable genius got into the White House, and all that wet down the tube. Now, we don't even have the capacity to ramp up to a million masks a day or 10 million tests a day. These are the quantities we need! 

I will never forgive this President for putting my internist daughter at risk every hour she works with Covid-19 patients   without the elementary personal security that he takes for granted at taxpayer expense. This is just evil."
2020-03-20 09:03:09,"What on earth is wrong with Trump?  I watched the briefing yesterday with the Governors.  Basically, he said, you are on y our own, find them yourself!  Some of the Governors reported that when they did try to buy privately, they were undercut by the Federal Government.

He is seemingly unaware that having the right equipment will make sure the 'numbers' of sick people will go down, not up.

Hopefully now that FEMA is on the case, there will at least be a stock take taken, so everyone can understand what the issue is."

2020-03-20 11:28:51,"These crucial supplies are not available in sufficient numbers here in the US and obviously we won't be getting them from elsewhere.  Making more is going to take time, which unfortunately we do not have.

This was known before Corvid-19 had ever emerged and nothing was done about it. The federal government totally dropped the ball and now we will all pay the price. In typical Trump fashion he deflects, denies and lies, while placing the responsibility on state governors and his political enemies. 

Having a competent president really matters folks, and this is just one instance  of the danger of not currently having one. Putting an unqualified fool in the White House is going to end up costing thousands of people their lives."
2020-03-20 11:48:28,"Another thing Trump got wrong...the Federal Government IS our shipping clerk.  In this time of national emergency, there is a stockpile of masks.  There are war emergency measures provided by law that allows the Federal Government to mandate mask and PPE production by private factories.  

NY cannot order a factory in MI to make masks.  The Federal Government can.  Once the masks and other PPE equipment is made, the Federal Government then ships to where the stock is needed.

All we now require is a president who can make an appropriate decision.  Trump is the most incompetent politician I have ever come across in my 55 years of voting.  It appears that the only reason he would pull the trigger on getting masks made under any war powers act is when he sees a profit for himself coming his way.

I demand to hear his reasons for doing nothing.  I am entitled to his rationale since he is such a pathological liar and has proven to be untrustworthy."
2020-03-20 06:16:39,"The reality is to stop the spread every person needs to wear a mask when they are in public settings. Since we know there are not enough we need to have every city, county etc start the process of making homemade masks now. The countries with the greatest success against the virus were the places where immediately 100% of people wore masks in public settings, greatly reducing the spread. The government and CDC need to step up and tell the people the truth, wear masks in public. you want to preserve masks for medical workers it starts by having everyone wear a mask. The average person can use the same mask for days and gete adequate protection. In korea they get issued 2 masks per person per week. It will only get worse until the government immediately starts telling people to wear masks in public!"
2020-03-20 07:06:30,There are high quality protective masks that the military uses a called NBC masks. These masks should be lent to health care workers in hospitals. 3M and other companies make half face and full face masks called p100 masks which are better then n95. they should use those. This is an emergency! I hope that masks are lent to hospitals and that the government buy the p100 masks!
2020-03-20 08:06:14,"NY Times, please highlight the plight of pharmacists and pharmacy staff working without personal protective equipment (PPE) in about 67,000 pharmacies located across the nation. Pharmacists, working without PPE, are fully exposed when they administer flu, pneumonia shots to customers, some of whom may carry the corona virus. 
Please contact the CEOs of the major pharmacy chain to get them to act swiftly in protecting their employees and the families of the employees."
2020-03-20 09:31:09,"I heard this story three days ago on the brian Lhrer program on NPR. A NYC nurse called in to express dismay that hospital workers did NOT have the proper attire to address corona virus patients. She asked the media and press to make this an issue.

Non-profit hospitals that don't stockpile such equipment in good times to prepare for bad times should have their non-profit status looked at!"

There are many, many of us sheltering at home who would like to help and send such masks to hospitals that would like them.  We all need to help one another since the Trump Administration is not."
2020-03-20 06:20:02,"We are going to kill a significant number of nurses, doctors, and other health care providers if this is not corrected.  If you just think about the death rates by age then I'm guessing that it will be over 1% of our health care providers killed due to lack of planning and poor mobilization after the problem has been recognized.  This is unacceptable."
2020-03-20 07:22:21,"Something’s completely off here. We’re putting healthcare workers lives at risk when we know what they need and how to make it. If this is a war, shouldn’t we be on a war footing? For World War II the government mobilized the country to produce blankets, uniforms, tanks, airplanes, bombs, ammunition, of course rivets, and anything else you can think of. For that particular effort corporate executives showed up in Washington to work for a dollar a year. Hmm.... Would that happen now?  Do we think Tim Cook and Bill Gates will help administer a massive manufacturing program? I wouldn’t bet the ranch (if I had one). Do we think Trump has the humility and wisdom to ask them? Mark Zuckerberg? He’ll take a dollar a year if he can get Trump reelected and stave off anti-trust actions. If we needed any evidence that this is a different world, there we have it. We’re in a war and the people who should be helping us fight it are in it for themselves. That includes a famous opinion host now providing the most destructive commentary imaginable, and who, emblematically enough, once said, “I’m only in it for the money.” In the old America we really were in it together. Now, with our neighbors glorifying demagogic divisiveness, everybody’s in it for themselves. Not the best circumstances under which to make surgical masks. That’s the story: this country and its ideals died long before this epidemic. If they hadn’t, we’d be making millions of masks tomorrow morning."
2020-03-20 10:40:41,"Back in the early 1980's, our hospital put several people with a ""new disease"" in negative pressure rooms, and required gowns, hair bonnets gloves, and ""booties"" (disposable shorts covers) to enter.  The fear that this unknown disease could mushroom out of control was real. As our understanding of the disease slowly grew, we had significant problems and concerns with the fears and resignation of staff rather than work with them.  That particular diagnosis changed over the years from unknown, to ""gay related complex,"" to HTLV3, to HIV and AIDS. 

We've had at least that long to think about how we'd respond if a highly virulent airborne disease emerged and rapidly spread. There's no excuse not to have taken the preparatory steps to assure adequate supply of PPE."
2020-03-20 10:38:35,"It seems as though the national stockpile is a whole lot smaller than it was after the SARS epidemic.  A Virginia Department of Health Official told us that the National stockpile is sized for a regional problem, not a national one.  I wonder if this is one of the reasons that strategic meetings at CDC were classified as secret?

We need some great investigative journalism on this one!"
2020-03-20 06:21:13,Without the heathcare providers  there will b noone to care for you when 50% population will be infected. Give us protection and we will protect you!
2020-03-20 06:25:40,"we know COVID19 is airborne (WHO) but CDC downgraded their recs to wear n95 and airborne precautions only for procedures like intubation, suctioning, etc. And CDC recs that surgical mask to be worn with suspected or known COVID19 cases, but we know that from China and Italy's experience,  there were 50 to 70% of tested individuals that are asymptomatic that help to spread the disease...BUT we are barely even testing here...so imagine you are a doctor who know these things: 1 there are people walking around who are Asymptomatic but can give you the disease 2 we are not testing widely 3 i don't want to get disease, so you can conclude that you need ppe in the healthcare setting period because this is a high risk environment for the infection... so you buy them or you put in what you can get a hold of, because any protrction is better than no protection ( the cdc concedes that much with its suggestion of wearing bandanas ) , but then you get to the hospital and administration warns you to take it off because this goes against cdc recommendations... colleagues are getting warnings, some are getting fired and some downright assaulted with adminyankings masks of their faces...this is not right. Your frontline warriors should not have to fight for the right protection and gear for this war on COVID19. This is morally wrong to march them into battle and we know from China and Italy that healthcare workers are at greater risk of dying fue to multiple exposures..."
2020-03-20 09:38:18,"The Washington Post has an article about the law being changed on Wednesday, March 18, 2020 to allow manufacturers of N95 masks to sell to healthcare providers without being sued.  This is supposed to get much needed N95 masks to healthcare providers, but there still may not be enough masks to meet demands.

Why did those in charge wait so long to change this law?  Those N95 mask manufacturers should have sold to healthcare providers whether or not they are exposed to lawsuits.  People first not profits first.

We had all better pray that despite an almost completely lack of national leadership in this time of national crisis (viruses know no borders), that most of the individual little states can muddle through somehow without any Major Meltdowns happening.... and we can all do our individual parts as well as pressuring elected officials to take the situation more seriously and do what should be done - well, what should have already been done a couple of months ago."
2020-03-20 13:48:00,"I’m a physician in NYC, in private practice  and this is so true, we don’t have enough gear to see patients. We can’t just see everyone that comes in or calls if we can’t protect ourselves, our staff and our patients. We feel helpless. We are not able to help the ER by seeing the cases they should not be burdened with and we can’t help our patients either and most likely many of our practices will have to close. We can’t find PPE. We try to order and can’t get anything. It’s a dire situation."
2020-03-20 13:53:11,"My son is an emergency room physician in Utah and he tells me patients have been stealing gloves, masks and goggles from the emergency department. They have even been pulling dispensers from walls to steal hand sanitizer. Hospitals have had to lock up these items rather than having them available where doctors can get to them quickly. Don’t these people realize they are stealing from those we count on to be life savers - those who are putting their lives on the line to get us through this pandemic? I find this to be one of the most disturbing behaviors I have heard of in this crisis."
2020-03-20 14:19:46,"This protective healthcare equipment should be funded by the government, and it is yet another sign of this Administration’s lack of pandemic preparedness that we are in such short supply and without a plan for replenishing supplies. Where, though, are the opportunities for private donation to fund protective gear, ventilators, and the like? Surely many who would want to do something to help our frontline nurses and physicians as well as the critically ill would want to help in this way."

She is tough, and is is charge of handing out masks.  Imagine being the mask police....she is steely in her resolve that she/they must look out for the good of the whole, but still..
I plan to email her every day and send little notes and cartoons to her and her family frequently.  She, and others in her position, need not only more supplies but all of our support and cheer, as she is on the front lines."

They are pretty comparable to those I used as a nurse during procedures. I am also sewing double cloth “surgical” masks.  My daughter’s hospital so far doesn’t allow home made PPE but I will be ready, when they do. And even if they don’t, the employees can take the masks home to protect themselves when shopping or to protect their family. I am making some for my neighbors too. Keeping busy helps me cope in a productive way with being cooped up. I spent my promised stimulus check ahead of a time; happy to do so to support the front-line caregivers. Thank you all for being here for the rest of us!"

2020-03-20 13:43:40,"Last night my family and I made a box of face splash-shields from clear plastic dividers, mounting tape, twill and a strip of upholstery foam. They look and feel pretty comparable to those I used in Endo lab. I will make more boxes of them as soon as Amazon delivers more twill. It takes more than I expected. I am also sewing two ply fabric “surgical” masks. I plan to deliver to local hospital where my daughter works. She said they were told they are not allowed to use home made PPE, but if the time comes when hospital runs out and she would have to intubate her patients without PPE, I would hope the hospital would relax those rules. Some barrier  is better than none. And if the hospital doesn’t allow the home made surgical masks, I think the employees can take them home to protect their family from them. Keeping busy makes the whole family less anxious and hopeful. We are also making various snack packages. My daughter said they need food. In this whole disaster, it is a shame that the brave worriers facing and invisible killer have limited protection and have to go hungry. I blew my stimulus check from  government before I got it on supplies, and happy to do so. Thank you all front-line care givers!!!"

By handing off all responsibility to the states he ensures his ability to be able to say 'It's not my fault.'  donald trump has abandoned the country.  His main preoccupation is controlling the message.  We are being told that information is available at coronavirus .gov.  That is a White House controlled website.  Why is not the CDC at the head of the list?  We are rapidly becoming a third world country.

I hope there's an uprising (albeit not with crowds - virtual) by all people and lawmakers pronto!

2020-03-20 15:06:26,"Trump has declared something to the effect that we are at war with the Novel Coronavirus. His failure to immediately enact the Defense Production Act and order factories to produce desperately needed personal protective equipment, and increase production and distribution of basic cleaning supplies for all of us, coupled with his cruelly flippant remarks about the Federal government not being in the shipping business make him not much better than a war criminal in my mind. Many people will needlessly suffer or die due to his inaction, and gross mismanagement of this crisis.  Our brave healthcare workers need real supplies and equipment NOW."
2020-03-20 16:16:20,I'm so tired of Trump's daily coronavirus briefings where they spend more than half the time self-congratulating and continuing  to make misleading and false information. They keep telling us everything is great but hospitals and front line workers are telling a different story.  Trump isstill treating this mostly as a political messaging  and reelection campaign. The fact remains Trump and this administration failed and continue to fail in doing the job they should be doing. He must be removed from office.
2020-03-20 13:19:44,"When the history of this crisis is written, Trump's ""We're not a shipping clerk"" is going to go right up there on his list of inspiring leadership quotes next to ""I don't take responsibility at all."""

He thinks criminal charges are due for the lack of pandemic preparedness. He is using his own supply of masks (3) that certainly won’t prevent aerosol virus infection. He said that Iran and China have head to toe protective gear.  Really? Is this the best we can do?

That wouldn't necessarily put the federal government in control of an industry; rather, industries could voluntarily work with the government to determine where to send limited stock. That wouldn't be necessary if individuals hadn't stockpiled masks for themselves. Now, an extraordinary situation requires an extraordinary response."

2020-03-20 18:11:14,"Of course Trump and Republicans are majorly at fault here. But let’s not kid ourselves, the Democrats, including Biden, are similarly beholden to the Insurance Industry, Big Pharma and Silicon Valley. Eventually such a catastrophe was bound to happen. Everything being profit driven, we have been conditioned to just accept this mantra. Private Enterprise with minimum restrictions = good, any government involvement = bad. If something is drilled into you, day after day by media and politicians alike, that our private for profit health care system is superior to all others and that markets rule, this is the tragic consequence. Many people are uninsured, many are homeless on the streets, many live from paycheck to paycheck and are on the verge of going hungry and becoming homeless. This is an ideal environment for this virus to spread. One should never prioritize laissez faire capitalism over peoples. Universal Healthcare should not be an impossible pipe dream, rather It should be our right! Same goes for a sadly lacking social safety net. Can’t we  
finally adopt ideas from other advanced countries, those that have both free markets and protections for their workers. There is a better way to run countries. Profits and COE compensation are not as important as the health and well-being of the population at large."

As a vulnerable elder person, I am staying home.  I am depending on my niece and a stranger to help me, my niece with picking up Passover items for me (they are hard to get where I live) and the stranger to take my garbage to the dump.  

I'm very grateful for the help I'm getting, but if I should contract this virus despite precautions, I don't want to be triaged into death because there are not enough ventilators, nor do I want that to happen to anyone else.

Trying to blame the ""previous administration"" for the ""horrible"" system they inherited is typical of the responsibility dodging moron occupying our white house.  If the system was that bad they had three long years to change it.  They were told more than a year ago that we were not prepared for a pandemic.

I'm glad to hear of anything that shows promise in treating coronavirus, but the thought of shortages is scary. I was able to get a ninety day refill a few weeks ago and will try to refill early next time. I have to use a mail-order pharmacy and I think most of what I get are generics made in either China or India.

The drug blocks the receptor that the virus uses to get into cells, so researchers think it might stop or slow the illness.""

That's not precisely true. Losartan, an ARB, may increase ACE2, and that in turn may actually help reduce severe lung disease because it's protective (but ACE2 is also the sole protein that SARS-CoV-19 uses to dock, so....the other side of the debate is that people on Arbs could be more at risk). Basically, we don't know yet.

China has said that it has been used to treat Covid-19 patients and has produced encouraging outcomes. 

why isn't there more talk about this treatment? is it even being tried in the US? Europe? the information isn't hard to find. i haven't seen it mentioned in the NYTimes - i may have missed it.

EFFECTIVE CV DRUG: AVIGAN (favipiravir)
MFR: Fujifilm Toyama Chemical

""“It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,” Zhang told reporters on Tuesday.
It may be the case in the US, but Chinese doctors are reporting one drug that is effective in moderate cases.
Not sure why it wasn't mentioned in this article, but it was widely reported in international media yesterday.

""Patients who were given the medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virus after a median of four days after becoming positive, compared with a median of 11 days for those who were not treated with the drug, public broadcaster NHK said.

""In addition, X-rays confirmed improvements in lung condition in about 91% of the patients who were treated with favipiravir, compared to 62% or those without the drug.""

The Guardian - Japanese flu drug 'clearly effective' in treating coronavirus, says China."

He is the bell of the ball and is loving every minute of this. Honestly, it all feels so surreal."
2020-03-20 14:26:13,"There is something not right about this epidemic, and I don’t mean the virus, which is natural enough. Bat borne diseases are often lethal. When zoologists investigate bat caves they enter wearing gas masks.

After a delay, sufficient to spread it internationally,—I would call it a studied hesitation—, that was passed off as local authority secrecy and incompetence, a well oiled, practised response was rolled out; portable hospitals, you name it. And now the epidemic is almost over in China. Meanwhile the West is in the throws of a galloping epidemic and suffering immense economic damage.

Production has restarted in Wuhan, and China is looking forward to satisfying the unmet wants of resource-rich countries, with the goods that would previously have gone to us. It is guaranteed deliveries of raw materials they are after.

Another remarkable thing is that unlike in Europe where political figures have been catching the virus, I am yet to read of senior CCP figures catching it, like they were afore-thinking made cautious."

The cessation of economic activity on the ground is real, and as social distancing spreads across the country out of necessity, the economic damage is going to be severe.  Thinking about how an interruption to business activities just from our own midsize company is rippling outward, one starts to get an inkling of just how many millions of people this is going to negatively affect.

This is also a reminder of how fake the Trump stock market rally was, fueled by a trillion-dollar tax giveaway to the rich that spurred companies to buy back their own stock and shower executives with massive compensation.  That sugar-high paper wealth is all gone, having done absolutely nothing for society.

Assuming the virus can be brought under control, we should eventually rebound.  When we do, let’s hope American voters remember that competence, preparation, a more equitable tax code, universal health care and a social safety net really do matter to their own wellbeing."
2020-03-20 14:53:19,"I find all this quantitative easing very unsettling, very disturbing. Historically, money was debased by taking out the precious metals in the coinage. Then, they discovered that they could print money, so then the printing presses would be turned on. Now, they have more sophisticated ways of achieving the same result, of devaluing our money. It’s called QE, or quantitative easing. But it amounts to the same thing: the creation of funny money.

At one time, we adopted the Gold Standard: the value of money was tied to the value of gold. That ensured discipline in central banks and government. We need to get back to it as soon as possible. We will never achieve true success in economic terms by pumping funny money into the money supply. It also erodes people’s savings. It’s time to call a halt to this nonsense."

Regardless of the money governments are pumping into the economies across the Western world, these are only Band Aids. The underlying state of Western economies is weak and weakening still further. How can it be anything else? Countries are in lockdown. Pestilence is upon us: people cannot go out to consume much; people cannot travel; people cannot go about their daily lives.

Once it seems people are relatively safe, then we need to start thinking about how to help those who will be personally financially devastated by this. THEN, once the threat has passed, we can start talking about how to rebuild our economy."

This will probably need to be followed by another multi-trillion dollar package focusing on infrastructure and the like after everyday life starts to return to some kind of normal.

That will pay one month of rent if we're lucky enough to live in a low COL state. Most Americans cannot telecommute. Their jobs are not suited for it. CA and NY is ordering everyone to stay home and other states will soon follow, I'm sure. For the unlucky most of us who can't telecommute, how are we supposed to support ourselves?

Socialism, you know, that thing they've been telling us was a con job to give free stuff to lazy people and the downfall of Venezuela?
Now when billionaires start worrying about themselves getting sick, NOW they are ready to give ""free stuff"" to the poor and they embrace full on socialism, including it seems taking a government stake in bailed out industries (unlike the Obama/Biden bailout in 2008 that only bailed out banks and industries and shafted the peons).

The anti China bigotry is similarly ridiculous because they fund the West's impecunious  desire-based economies.

You see, the Chinese diaspora is a huge entity irrespective of who is in charge.

“Do you mind if I ask you something? You said there’d be no logic in your stinging me. Why did you do it?”

“It has nothing to do with logic,” the drowning scorpion sadly replied. “It’s just my character.”"

Now more and more people die, more and more countries are locking their people in their houses like in China, a tyranny. South Korea did the only thing acceptable for a democracy: they acted fast and with agility and they tested, tested and tested again, identifying who and where.
All the Trumps, Macrons, Johnsons  of the world stayed idle like rabbits caught in the headlights, maybe simply protecting their assets.
Now they all deserve to pay the political price for it and Trump should be the first one. Everything he did since elected president was to undermine the american preparedness for a crisis, whatever it is. He said again and again that he was here to drain the swamp, shut down big government.  he accused public servants of being partisan just because they voiced their concerns when they saw the destruction of america's power.
He must pay the political price for doing what democrats, but not only, were sounding the alarm for.

This situation is going to get much worse over the coming weeks.

I don't want or need any assistance from the government. That said, I do understand that practically it may be quicker and easier for the government to provide assistance to most Americans (possibly based on tax return AGIs) -- as opposed to the red tape and delays that would come from determining who is actually in need.

It was reckless in the strategy and had no way of handling any “black swan event”. Couple this with a revolving door of appointees, wild high spending on pet projects, and the “wack a mole” of handling the vast government employees, where everyone is fair game for out right assault, by just speaking the truth.

So now we are in a massive recession brought by the president of the United States.  Why? He only cared when the market reacted.  What should be done:

the navy ships should be sailing two weeks ago
Army personal should be trained in infectious control
Ships, curse ships, and hotels should be placed in harbors in every major city with FEMA and military personal 
Mask,PPE an any and all things need should be available
Test should be like alll over the United states

The best system around is a mixed economy: largely capitalistic in nature, but modified by socialist elements, such as universal basic income, unemployment benefit, medical care for all, etc. Just check out how successful Scandinavian countries are.

Unfettered capitalism is a disaster! It leads to misery and gross inequality. In 2018, CEOs made 287 times more than their workers. Now, of course, it’s even worse. This needs to stop!

I have never thought of myself as an adherent of socialism but, the older and wiser I get, the more I see that capitalism is riddled with injustices and flaws. How on earth can we justify the current levels of income and wealth inequality? Can you really tell me that a CEO can work 300 times harder than one of his workers? Absolutely not!

Forget socialism! Just let us have a fairer system for all!

Americans, from birth, are brainwashed into thinking that money from the government for the poor and less-well-off is socialism. They don’t seem to care how much governments give the élite in the form of bailouts and tax breaks. That is socialism for the rich. If it’s for the rich, it’s okay; if it’s for the poor, it’s dirty socialism.

Maybe ‘valuation’ would be ok. The ‘value’ wiped out was fake due to the free money in this rigged domain. By rather simple math, and history, the Dow should be somewhere near 12000, but since it overshot the proper valuations for the last 3-4 years, that has to be ‘paid back’ by an undershoot below ‘fair valuation’. My conjecture is: Dow will level at about 9500-10500 range, and then start a SLOW rise, with the recent peak attained about 2032."

Why?  The risk of credit losses is high because of the downturn in the real economy.  That now pales beside the risk that financial firms have taken huge losses on their bets in financial, commodity and currency markets.  Just like in 200,  banks have been 'insuring' others in the market against loss via derivatives that are not usually reflected on their balance sheets.  Where they are publicly recorded, they do not reveal who was 'insured'.

The lack of transparency about who is on the hook for which losses leads market participants to regard all of their counterparts as risks.  So they stop trading with each other and repo markets, etc stop working which risks companies not getting the working capital they need to function.

The only real differences between what happened in 2008 and now is that in 2008 over-leveraged households kicked off the problem;  this time it is companies that are carrying too much debt - and we are facing demand and supply shocks in the real economy as well as gyrations in financial and commodity markets we could not even imagine in 2008.

This crisis is different because, as people correctly point out, it's not financial, it's real. (The humor of the contrast is left to the reader to discover.) BUT, there is a bright side.

To get the time BEFORE 2008 when a president was faced with this sort of crisis, we have to go back to the 1930s and FDR. He ushered in an era of unprecedented broad-based American prosperity. Keynesian government spending works, but NOT when it's aimed simply at propping up a system that has shown itself over and over again to enrich the already-wealthy at the expense of everyone else.

What we need, this time, is a bold new move. We need a Trump New Deal. Yes, I know we already have the Green New Deal. But let's face it, unless we allow Trump to copy their homework, nothing good is going to get done. When things go down, we get to decide how they go up. Let's make the smart choice. Let's use this downturn as a way to make sure we pour the now-molten steel of our economy into a new mold. Cutting checks to every American adult is, at best, going to get us back to ""normal.""

It came up 13 votes short of that target, with a final vote of 228 to 205 against. Two-thirds of Democrats and one-third of Republicans voted for the measure, followed immediately by a 7% fall in the market.

So far the US mortality or fatality rate from those tested +ve for COVID-19 is 1.6%. That means 98.4% who test +ve will survive. That is roughly 1 in 100 persons who test +ve, die. An important lesson from Iran and Italy, both of which have 5 times the mortality rate because they have a high carbohydrate diet.  A well nourished person receiving balanced nutrition with optimal protein intake and able to mount a robust normal immune response will survive with a mild or manageable infection. 

With no vaccine in sight and no specific antiviral and no one talking about a broad spectrum antiviral that I have been proposing for the past 3 months or more, the way forward is to risk developing a herd immunity by distancing from persons who have tested positive. I am no longer afraid of being around a person who has tested +ve as long as they remain 10 feet away from me. I have always tried to be on a balanced diet and I therefore do not fear that my immune system will be weak. If I were to be exposed at a reasonable distance of 10 feet or more, I trust my immune system to crush the virus like roach and then elicit a sterilizing immunity that could last a life time. 

I fear the irrational fear of people who are trying to exploit the panic pandemic. I disagree with Trump that Chloroquine needs to be deployed or that there was no insider selling before COVID-19"

Debt.

US shale oil companies are geared to their gills. They are making a loss with every barrel they pump, and will be unable to make debt repayments - they'll default.

That will knock on to the banking sector, and ripple out throughout the whole economy. Debt will come into serious focus.

The amount of corporate debt, especially fallen angels and junk bonds, is scary even now. at the current levels, defaults are inevitable. However, companies that used to look decent bets will ALSO not be able to make repayments and will default.

This includes food service workers, housekeepers, and so forth. Many of them are contract workers, who are not eligible for unemployment benefits, and probably have little to no savings.

I contacted the president of my organization this afternoon. I wanted to know if they could, or already have, organize help for these people, who will likely be laid off -- to which my colleagues and I are willing to contribute. His office has already replied. I was not alone in bringing it up. And I believe we are going to make this happen!

Those of us who are fortunate to still have a paycheck should help our neighbors. Including the people within our own communities and companies who are facing lay-offs and hardships.

I don't want or need any government assistance. I am one of the fortunate ones who can continue to work from home and still collect a paycheck. But if I get a $1200 check from the government, I pledge to use it to help my neighbors, my colleagues, my community, and/or charities."

Fortunately, we also have assets in non-tax advantaged, non-market vehicles, so we will be ok for some time without having to monetize what are at the present time only paper losses.  

However, if this market swoon goes on for some years (which would not surprise me) we will then have to monetize some painful losses.

The best that we can hope for is that either:
1. we can wait out the market, or
2. we pass on, leaving the diminished IRA accounts to our children as inherited IRAs, who will then have to take the entire amounts as taxable distributions over a ten year period.

If Trump gets re-elected, all bets are off.  He is proving that he is the ""Bankruptcy King,"" having been through six bankruptcies in his own businesses.

Now he is trying to prove that he can do for the US, and for each of us, what he did for his own businesses.

In a normal, evenly spread demand-induced recession, sending out checks provides direct stimulous.  But this is different.

This is a focussed demand-based AND supply-based recession.  So the more focussed the checks can be the better.  The need to be focussed on owners of small businesses just to help them pay their bills.  In fact, probably a better model here would be to allow the most-affected small businesses to submit claims to the government to help them stay in business.

""In the last five days alone, Boeing stock has fallen by 36 percent.""

That would have happened even without the coronavirus, because Boeing cannot seem to sort out their 737MAX problem, and they might have to reimburse many airlines for the business those airlines lost on account of planes that are not approved to fly.  Coronavirus just gives Boeing some breathing space, because airlines are flying many fewer flights these days, and the grounded 737MAX planes are not costing them lost passenger sales at the moment.

A more consequential issue would be a law that would prohibit any company that takes even one cent of ""bailout money"" from buying back even one share of their own stock (or stock of any company that holds a bailout loan - so they can't play ""you scratch my back and I scratch yours"") for such time that the loan is outstanding.  In other words, prohibit company A buying $1 Billion of company B stock, company B buying $1 Billion of company A stock, and then they swap the newly purchased stock."

I predict that this will end after two events take place (not before):

1. We find a vaccination that confers immunity to the coronavirus (so that it becomes feasible for groups of people to work together without large numbers falling ill).

2. We then institute MAJOR public works programs sprinkled all over the country, so that people can be employed in productive work that provides a benefit to our society as a whole - things like repairing and upgrading roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, airports, railroads (which are much more efficient than trucking) and water and sewer systems, installing digital communication systems and providing internet connected learning hardware for every student, and supporting public education (the GI Bill increased the economy by about $7 for every dollar of student cost).

2020-03-19 14:39:05,"My 70 year-old mother spends the winter in south Palm Beach County.  Until yesterday, she was out and about doing things.  My brother and his family were visiting her.  She didn't take this seriously. I still don't think she takes it seriously.  I live in the Bay Area and am subject to the shelter in place order. I work in local government with public health officials. I have been working on the emergency response for 3 weeks. It's crazy how differently California and Florida responded to this pandemic."
2020-03-19 15:34:46,"FL is the land of make believe. My wife and I travel with our RV and spend the month of April in FL. Our trip south involves several stopovers to visit an elderly parent and attend special events. For the past month we’ve been desperately seeking guidance to determine whether we should stay home. From FL, all we get is happy talk that the weather is gorgeous and the beaches are open. Our elderly parent continues to attend her weekly bridge games despite our pleas to stay home. Finally, last weekend we began to receive a couple of event cancellation notices. With this limited information, we’ve postponed our departure for 10 days. 

In the absence of any clear guidance from authorities on interstate motor travel, we will continue to err on the side of caution and stay home. We may loose money deposited to secure reservations, which is not right, but it may be a small price to pay."
2020-03-19 13:44:56,It’s amazingly simple-minded to not shut the state down immediately. There will be deaths. This is on Ron DeSantis and his band of tourism-industry bozos.
2020-03-19 13:53:53,It is extremely reckless that the governor of Florida is letting Spring Break continue on his beaches as the rest of the country is trying to contain the virus and then these kids will fly home to infect us all.  Considering the high risk elderly population in Florida I am surprised someone has not stepped in to make a more inteligent decision.
2020-03-19 14:29:30,"These students on Spring Break represent in a nutshell the collective mentality in American society is this notion that we are all entitled. We are selfish, we are spoiled and we are entitled. To what one might ask? We feel entitled to as we please, spend as well please, eat anything and cut down this and that is make room for more humans.

Those students or others on vacationing en made  who do not see the seriousness of this are in for a rude awakening. I would personally close that border and insist that every student and tourist must test negative or spend time in quarantine before they fly out and infect more areas."
2020-03-19 14:51:57,There is no reason NOT to clear those beaches and send them all packing---close the beach hotels.   What is wrong with this governor and with Florida?    Never mind--we already know the answer to that one.
2020-03-19 15:01:51,What happened to the 23 million they were awarded when they had only 3 cases? How did the governor see fit to use that money I wonder...
2020-03-19 15:04:49,"You forgot to mention another item in the mix that is deadly, Gov. DeSantis support of the republican de facto criminal (pre ACA) health care program.

No. matter which way this virus goes, it's gonna cost lives with un insured or underinsured people."
2020-03-19 15:07:52,"Florida’s dirty little secret: the State will do the very bare minimum, in any situation. Helping actual People costs Money, and they will NOT spend it. No State Income Taxes, very little Regulation of any Business, it’s the perfect place to thrive for Conman and Scammers. The State survives only on Tourist spending, and collecting sales Tax, occupancy tax, transaction fees, etc..etc.. on nearly everything Tourist related. The Property Taxes are high, for VERY little return.
  My Parents retired to the Gulf Coast, nearly 20 years ago. We visit often. Without the Tourist Dollars, this State would be another Alabama or Mississippi.
   In short, you’re on your own.  Be Careful."
2020-03-19 15:14:32,"Welcome to Floriduh!  DeSantis is a Trump clone totally lost and clueless, just like his pseudo god.  It is all about money down here and the public health is not really a big concern.  The only reason we do not have an explosion of cases is because our testing is pretty much nonexistent, especially when you consider the size of our population.   The Rs have controlled things down here for a while, but this crisis may change all that since their biggest supporters are the most vulnerable.  Bottom line?  It is going to get a lot worse down here and we are probably going to be the next ""Italy"" in the U.S.  It is who we are and what we do."
2020-03-19 15:16:05,"Revenge for the 2000 election. We are talking about a a state that took ""climate change "" out of all of their government literature and legislation.The chickens are coming home to roost."
2020-03-19 14:46:48,"This is a combination of ""the arrogance of youth"" and a ""slow to react"" government official. When will human beings actually pay attention to the world around them and then take personal responsibility to do all they can do to support the greater good?

I hope the worst will not happen in Florida. I fear, however, it may."
2020-03-19 15:26:27,"My 91 year old Mom lives in Delray Beach, Florida. She acts as if the virus is somewhere else. Goes out with her friends, went for a manicure yesterday, tells me we are over-reacting. 
The politicians who control the state, from governor to county officials, have purposely delayed a response to enable Spring Break. 
The greatest at risk population is being mislead, possibly a fatal decision."
2020-03-19 15:38:38,"Sadly, Florida’s cavalier attitude to the situation at hand is going to likely prove catastrophic for much of its population in due course, and no amount of tourist dollars will be able to wash away the sins of those who are letting this happen."
2020-03-19 13:47:22,Ron DeSantis  is very capable and you will see an appropriate and effective response.CDC will need to be reorganized they dropped the ball.When it is all over heads will have to roll and culture and leadership need to be changed.
2020-03-19 13:52:50,"Our Florida governor has been woefully slow to react to this potential health catastrophe.  Even into the second week of March, the beaches, theme parks, bars and restaurants were crowded.  There is still no widespread testing, and no one seems to know who should be getting tested, or how to schedule one.  The state should establish and publicize and dedicated web site that would provide accurate information and guidance."
2020-03-19 14:21:18,"This is what happens when a big portion of society completely isolates itself from reality. Trump promised it would disappear like a miracle, then that it was under control, then refused to take responsibility. You can convince people black is white, when it's all abstract and ideological. When they start dying it gets much harder.
The US sets an example to the entire world. I just miss the time it was an example to aspire to, not one to avoid."

2020-03-19 15:38:30,"Even if they don't suffer health consequences, or kill anyone else with their actions, most of these students don't seem to realize how this will play out the next time one of two things happens: a donor is asked to support scholarships or a taxpaying voter is asked to support funding of their universities. I predict those donors and taxpayers will decide to fund something else for people a little more needy and less self-absorbed."
2020-03-19 15:39:44,"I live in South Florida, North Palm Beach County.  It sure seems to be your level of concern and preparedness is dependent on the TV station that you listen too and the newsprint and periodicals you read. Many high income people here for “the season” act like it is a 5 month vacation. They are partying and having a great time non stop. Happy Hour, the beach, tennis, golf, pickleball, dinner out with friends, shopping. Restaurants have curtailed their business but the party just moves to someone’s house or condo picnic area. School is now out. High School kids have no where to go but to the beach. 

Florida thru tourism and seasonal visitors will spread coronavirus to the midwest and the northeast. I have parents in their 90’s in assisted living in Tennessee. I expect that I will never see them again. It is just a matter of time. The winner take all economy has left us with an extraordinary number of toys but very inadequate infrastructure. The non profit hospital business model in my town has beautiful facilities, luxury outpatient treatment but an acute shortage of critical care beds, and the just in time N95 masks, protective eye ware and sealed gowns to keep our medical staff safe.  

I have spent time trying to find details on the number of Level 1 ICU beds and ventilators for my beautiful hospital. Plenty of brochures on their women’s breast center, the just opened Anderson Cancer Institute with their 30 private infusion rooms. The new colonoscopy center but no ICU beds."
2020-03-19 14:51:59,"This is a tragic failure of leadership.  I was floored to see news reports of spring break revelers on Florida beaches.  This epidemic has been building to pandemic proportions for three months now.  Since late January we’ve know it was in the country and putting people in the ICU.  Why didn’t they ban spring break nonsense in mid February, tell the college kids not to visit. There’s no excuse for the governor supporting businesses over the lives of his residents."
2020-03-19 15:25:15,"Report from family members in Sarasota is that many people from the Northeast and Midwest decided since the airports were a problem then they would drive to ""escape"" from their own state restrictions to ""vacation"" in FLA.  Restaurants & bars are open. It is a ticking time bomb.  And these folks will all be bringing it back to their communities when they eventually decide to drive home."
2020-03-19 13:49:31,"“No excuses” for county health departments not testing says the governor.  How about “there are no test kits available?”  How about “County health departments were recently decimated, declared to be totally unnecessary, by federal mandate, your golf buddy?”  Who’s “not taking responsibility.”  I love the “blame the people below me” style."
2020-03-19 14:52:29,Ron DeSantis ran that famous commercial in which he taught his kids to love the Trump wall. He embraced Trump and Trump embraced him. Is anyone really surprised at the lack of Covid 19 testing in FL.
2020-03-19 15:58:18,"The governor needs to shut down spring break. Declare a state of emergency, shut down the bars, only allow take-out from restaurants. 

DeSantis, you appear slow to move because of the economic cost to business. Don't you understand that it will be worse if you don't act immediately to contain this thing.  

My parents are in Florida. They are over 80.  Their rental ends in April, when they plan to come home. I can't ""go and get them,"" Governor DeSantis.  Shame on you for dawdling."

2020-03-19 16:04:44,I have always wondered when a state full of elderly people on social security who vote reliably Republican every election would finally feel the results of voting against their self interest. I expected it would be gradual poverty as their elected officials took away their pensions to “balance the budget”.  But this virus brings the deadly problem of irrational voting into sharp focus. A group of at risk people who have voted with those who have been dismantling public healthcare will now have their lives dependent on the healthcare system they have participated in destroying. Maybe this is natures way of explaining the danger of listening to Fox News. You can’t fool Mother Nature.
2020-03-19 15:55:12,"I know a place on Florida’s Gold Coast that has a high percentage of people over 60 and a lot of transit and turnover.  Some of its transients have already tested positive for coronavirus. Yet it is not closed.

2020-03-19 16:08:08,I live in Philadelphia (in a state that has fewer cases than Florida). This sounds like I am living in a different country. I can see the city the city out of my window right now. The parking lots next to me -- usually packed on a weekday -- are completely empty. There is no one on the streets. At night the buildings are much darker than usual. Every restaurant and bar is closed. Florida needs to catch up. And soon. I really hope that our federal government will start doing their job and implement a nationwide order to stay inside. It is the only thing left to prevent this from getting out of hand and turning what could be a 5 week issue that affects a limited number of people into a 5 month issue that kills thousands.

2020-03-19 16:14:22,"De Santis didn't even appoint a permanent Secretary of Health until over a year into his term office, late January. The Republicans controlling this State have underfunded and defunded critical parts of this State's public health infrastructure for years. Throw in the refusal to expand Medicaid and lawsuit after lawsuit attacking the ACA, and that should give everyone a clear idea of why Florida's response to this pandemic is less than adequate."
2020-03-19 16:16:35,"We are dangerously behind the curve due to this administration's pathetic response se to all early d at a and warning signs - and Trump's refusal to recognize the severity of the crisis.

It is disgusting to see his politically-motivated daily update of our circumstances - a circle-""massage"" of his ego and obvious attempt at attributing progress to him instead of our REAL researchers, Doctors, State governments and medical industry. TRUMP HAS BEEN A THORN IN OUR SIDE, not a help. He has increased anxiety with his brainless Tweets, thoughtless petty comments and obvious ignorance. THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT MATTERS is that provided by IMPARTIAL medical EXPERTS like Fauci.

A REAL President (not Trump) would simply, truthfully and clearly summarize our progress, without falsely promoting himself for an upcoming election. If you have any doubts, just watch Obama's addresses during g the 2008 recovery and compare them to The Dotard's of today. Trump is barely doing the minimum required by his job, but the bar has been set so low that even that he touts as a major achievement.

REMEMBER THIS IN NOVEMBER. Trump is incapable of governing this country."

Stats in Europe show that 30% of those hospitalized with serious health problems from the coronavirus ARE UNDER 30 years old!! Hundreds & perhaps thousands of these American college students will get this virus then return to their colleges & families across America thus they'll be one of the main sources of the spread of this virus. The State of Florida (& other southern states) are totally irresponsible for not closing their beaches to these thousands of students. History will expose their selfish & dangerous decisions."
2020-03-19 15:39:25,"With so many kids congregating on the Florida beaches, many of them asymptomatic to the coronavirus, and the lax regulations on crowd spacing by Florida it is imperative for states like New York and New Jersey to protect its citizens by requiring all returning visitors from Florida to undergo a two week mandatory home￼ quarantine￼￼."
2020-03-19 16:05:10,"Florida has a long time honored tradition of being oblivious to reality. Combined with being the home of one the largest concentrations of con artists and grifters in North America, it should come as no surprise to anyone in America that the locals would be throwing caution to the wind and profiting from a pandemic regardless of the public health consequences."

2020-03-19 13:49:12,"Gov. DeSantis should have closed the beaches before spring break. He knew along with all the Florida businesses what was coming, but he didn't have the guts to tell the businesses that they would take a hit this years. Now the resident population of Florida will have to hunker down and prepare for the worse. I hope the citizens of Florida keep this in mind when voting in November as how the Republican party  cared more about the business interests than the safety of the Florida general public."
2020-03-19 14:04:05,"It's terrifying to think how many people in this state are infected but haven't been tested. Between the amount of out-of-state/overseas travelers we get and the slow rate of testing, we have people blithely going about their normal routines like nothing is happening. Once we get testing ramped up I'm sure Florida will see a huge spike in infection numbers. Be prepared, fellow Floridians."
2020-03-19 14:28:21,"At first I thought DeSantis was doing a pretty good job with this virus.  He seemed to be taking it seriously and preached the social distancing thing.

But then I saw the beaches.  Filled with young spring breakers who think they are immune.  Don't just think it is happening in Key West, it is happening at all the beaches in Florida as beaches are what we do.  I am in total sympathy with those small businesses that may have to close because of this but DeSantis should have closed the beaches before these spring breakers even came down.  They will be going home soon, hung over and possibly exposed.  Good luck to the entire nation."

I am suffering from possible symptoms, and attempted to get an appointment at the drive thru, without success due to overwhelming need and lack of tests.  I called numerous medical centers and finally the county health department, only to learn that there were no tests available in Palm Beach County.  My concern is that the hospitals and urgent care centers will not be prepared for all the cases that will result from the lackadaisical approach to this pandemic."

2020-03-19 18:39:25,"I’m from New York City down here on vacation since early March in Hollywood FL, next-door to Fort Lauderdale. 

It’s been frustrating to actually experience Florida’s fumbled response to the coronavirus as spring breakers flooded the beaches, restaurants and bars in the last week. 

The mayors of Broward and Miami Dade County’s shut the beaches Sunday and Hollywood followed Tuesday. Wednesday, the mayors restricted restaurant and bar hours. Today they finally closed bridge access to the beach communities, which are full of elderly residents and tourists. So now the police are barricading the bridges and patrolling the beaches, rather than devoting full resources to helping an elderly population in a health crisis. 

I’m not really sure which government branch at the state or local level, was trying to keep open the tourist trade but it’s clear none of the officials were putting the health and welfare of Florida’s elderly communities first.

Spring breakers should have been prevented from gathering in Florida as a first measure not as a last resort."
2020-03-19 21:08:28,"I asked this elsewhere and I’ll ask it here.  What might the effects be if the infection chart also included the total population?  For instance, Florida would be 300  infected (at the very least) out of a population of nearly 22,000,000?  

Again, I’m asking, not making a point."

2020-03-19 14:35:25,"I was absolutely horrified that these young adults were allowed to go on as if we are not going through this pandemic. Selfish, ignorant blind to the harm they could do. Vacation? For a generation so enlightened, they act as if they don’t have a brain cell among them. What is Florida thinking in allowing them to come anyway. What they make in money will cost 10 fold when they go back home. Do any of them have parents, grandparents? Shame on all."
2020-03-19 23:35:05,"It’s not just that the younger population doesn’t seem to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic. I live in Florida and my employer has done absolutely nothing to address COVID-19. No changes in protocols for cleaning and sanitizing, numbers of customers allowed in the store, customer access to products, etc. I am extremely concerned being a young person in contact with the senior population but have to continue working to make money. I am taking personal precautions but that doesn’t change the larger risk. It seems nothing can be done unless there is a widespread mandate."

Let's start with the one's who are living from one paycheck to the next, to those that are unemployed, the sick and elderly, the children in the streets...and small businesses that would certainly perish without a suitable social safety net. The reason there is an impasse right now in the Senate has to do with republican insistence in favoring the 'rich and powerful', as they did with the awfully unjust and socially worthless tax abatement in the not too distant past. The problem? Senators, in general, are well-to-do, hence, with too wide a social distance to embrace the needs of the least among us. Accordingly, let's get a respite and allow those 'in the know' to help right a wrong. And the sooner the better, in the name of justice and peace. Especially now, when we must be embarked in containing a viral crisis...together."
2020-03-23 17:36:17,"I was thinking something similar just this morning. Big business has easy access to financing, local small businesses do not. They need immediate assistance. The color and culture of our communities lies in these small, loved, independent businesses. They are owned and staffed by our neighbors, families and friends. These businesses need our support and that of our government as their difficulties are not caused by stock buybacks and excessive executive compensation. Most of us do not want to live in the vanilla community of chain businesses."
2020-03-23 17:47:13,"The small business is the cornerstone for all businesses and perhaps provides the most basic of service of all; that which is of personal worth. Consider the friendly barber of old, the helpful ""merchant"" offering one of a kind goods-the tinker or tailor. As business evolved and the ""delivery system"" became more complex with a broader reach and wider product lines new organizational structures were created. But the personal touch gradually disappeared.

While we are all suffering from this viral isolation let us reflect on ""our friends"" who run these businesses and reflect on the real worth they offer. If large corporations such as banks and car companies receive government assistance so should small business. After all, our economy starts with small beginnings."

From a functional perspective, both large and small businesses face the same problem (albeit on different scales):
 Decreased revenue -> profits dip below ZERO. -> layoffs ensue. 

As a small-business owner I empathize with AND UNDERSTAND what employees need, small business owners need and even the problems that large corporations such as airlines are facing. 

WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT. 

The sudden forced stoppage of work harms employees , small business owners AND the employees of large corporations indiscriminately. 
For example don’t think of it as bailing out airlines. Think of it as bailing out airline EMPLOYEES they earn $40 billion and are 300,000 strong in number. (Not to mention employees at airports , vendors etc). 

Don’t maximize the ability of small businesses owners to pay off loans. This unplanned stoppage will not be helped by taking on more debt. Don’t feel bad for the owners if you don’t want to. But feel bad for the employees: if the owner is in debt, there’s less for the employees and there will be fewer employees. 

Stop allocating blame and deciding who deserves what. This isn’t the time."

Enough people talked to him, expressing that we loved the food before the change, and will want to see the same quality and variety going forward. He readjusted his business plans and kept the kitchen staff and the great food.

You want money for small business.  Huge business wants money for huge business.  Rich guys want money because they're already rich.  You and Trump want to give them what they want.

You would be wrong.  You would be foolish.  You'd be putting political stuntsmanship, economic self-interest above reality.

To save mom and pop and Starbucks and Southwest (which, by the way, I do not) you will do it best, most efficiently, to longer-lasting effect, if you send the money, all the money, many trillions of dollars to individual Americans.

And I do mean ""give it"" (hard to take seriously, since it is their money after all).

No qualifiers, no tests, no strings.  Get social security numbers, get names and addresses, and get those checks out where they long to be.  Employed, unemployed, old young, ambitious, lazy all get checks.

Do it again, if you must.  And again.

Make the checks big, meaningful; if you can stand the thought, make them generous.

People will spend the money.  They will save mom and pop and, sadly, Southwest when that time comes.

Nothing else you do, no other plan you have come up with will work."
2020-03-23 17:15:16,"I have a paint your own pottery studio for 16  years in a mall in Colorado. It was temporarily closed in May 2017 due to a hailstorm which took out the whole mall. I had business insurance. I was able to cover my expenses and pay all of my employees every 2 weeks as I always had while I rebuilt my business. We reopened at full capacity on Black Friday 2017. I checked with my insurance company immediately when I saw this happening and was told COVID19 is not a Covered Cause.

Our small businesses do not need loans, they need grants. And this can be accomplished through enlisting the existing infrastructure in the Insurance Industry. Make COVID19 CLOSURE a covered cause. Then the insurance industry can pay on it to the individual businesses just like it did for our hailstorm. 

Then the Insurance Industry gets reimbursed by the Federal government. The feds do not need to set up a whole new Dept. To monitor The Grant Program to businesses and this can be started IMMEDIATELY! Relief can happen now! 

My insurance company was wonderful. They saved my business and my employees’ jobs. And they can do their part now in this time of need, use them!"

Pillars of our financial stability have proven themselves shaky at best. Our political systems and leaders have shown that partisan politics, egotism, and differing ideologies cannot offer their people the level of healthcare needed to sustain their well-being. Our individual “Me first” sensitivities have led to bare supermarket shelves with some trying to price gouge their fellow citizens in a time of great need. The upshot of all of this greed, nationalism, and ignorance has led the greatest health care system in the world into disorganization with the inability to test everyone who needs it. How can a pandemic be controlled if there aren’t enough testing kits available for use? Unless, as is the case with several wealthy NBA teams money can buy diagnostics at anytime. So, as in the story of Passover, we are asked to isolate ourselves in our homes while the angel of death passes over us. We have been reduced to this because  of the inconvenience that acknowledgement of this viral pandemic would cause to the ambitions of our nation’s leadership. And no payments from the government, and no interest rate manipulation of interest rates by the Fed will ever repay us for lives both destroyed and lost. And the virus lives on with nothing to prevent it and nothing to stop it. Something to think about."

It has been presciently observed that, by education, experience, and culture, most of humanity thinks and acts in linear, rather than exponential, terms. The resulting inequality in the distribution of wealth and income in favor of those who manipulate the price-clearing mechanisms of the markets according to a non-linear metric has been broadly characterized as the “financialization” of our globally interconnected and interdependent society. Because that metric has been, for the most part, orderly and moderate, the resulting inequalities, though massive, have been made tolerable through state intervention (basically through taxation and the provision of a social safety net). Covid-19 is a self-learning viral process with an exponentially explosive, rather than moderate, growth curve. It remains to be seen whether state action can deal with the resulting new paradigm that defies the traditional price-clearing market mechanisms. When supply and demand and costs are non-linear, the only solutions are of biblical proportions reflected in “free money” and the “Jubilee” of debt forgiveness. I fear that the linear mentality of our politicians will not be up to task until Chaos dictates the terms of Her own resolution."

My point?  For those who voted Republican and believed that people ought to stand on their own two feet and be self-supporting, I hope some of you are standing in the unemployment line seeking help.

2020-03-19 15:19:08,"It isn't just the economy that must be managed. Ideally this should be accompanied by quality, sympathetic communication to the public about why decisions are being made, as FDR did with his fireside chats. People who feel alone or cheated in a crisis tend toward political extremism afterward. They need to feel that they matter, they need to understand what's happening and why, and they need to feel that leadership is on their side. The Great Recession produced large numbers of people who don't understand why industries and corporations may need government support, and who now distrust corporations and their leaders simply because they are corporations. Actions to prop up the economy should be accompanied by clear, sensitive communications. Obviously, as well, the arrangements themselves must be free of corruption and as evenhanded as they can be."

At first, Trump was taking the U.S. in the direction of the first scenario. Thanks to medical experts, health care professionals, and local, county, and state government leaders, Trump was forced to drop his ""don't worry -- be happy"" approach and began to deal with reality. So he deserves plenty of blame, and the jury is still out on what if anything to give him credit for. None of the measures now being taken originated with him.

3. A truthful economics would recognize put the dignity of

2. The economy is a secondary concern. And the financial markets are a tertiary (or lower) concern.

3. The silver lining is that #1 and #2 above are actually in alignment, in terms of the correct policy response. The sooner that we can contain this disease, the soon the economy and the financial markets will ultimately recover. 

4. As such, we should first address the public health crisis, save lives, and provide assistance to the many people who lose their paychecks in the near-term so that everyone can continue to meet their basic needs, including housing, food, and healthcare. For those who are concerned about the economic impact, an effective public health response is also the roadmap to recovery in that regard.

This is a serious problem, and it will likely have impacts well into next year (2021). But we can and will get through this. Let's keep our priorities straight. We can and must address the public health crisis, and we can help people and save lives.

Same provision for companies of any kind, but in their case, the tenant/debtor must agree to strict requirements (no stock buybacks, dividend increases or voluntary partnership distributions for 5 years, no tax special loopholes, no executive bonuses or new stock options to vest for 5 years, no increase in leverage beyond refinancing and business continuity, a brigade of auditors, mandatory jail time and triple-damage penalties for fraudsters, plus prominent whistleblower phone lines and rewards for tipsters to keep shady actors and execs honest). 


And don't hesitate to impose a 10 or 15 percent tax on corporate stock buybacks and a 10 percent millionaire surtax on individual gross income over $500k, to help pay for all this. We wouldn't be in this stew if the GOP's Trump tax cuts had not syphoned off the profits for the 1 percenters."

Maybe, our society will have learned the difference between want and NEED.
Maybe we will begin to have a more human centered healthcare system, medicare for all.
Maybe the American economy will change in ways that
make the economy more ethical, and realizing that the economy's purpose is to serve the society, and not expecting society to serve the economy with the humans  seen only as consumers to be manipulated into buying more and more, always and forever.
I'm not sure the economy could change.
It would take leadership.
I remember that Bernie Sanders was invited to give a speech at the Vatican on ""The Moral Economy"", a concept he has not talked much about lately.
To the Establishment, the idea of a moral economy is unAmerican.

Cry me a river. I am currently stuck in the house, there is no toilet paper and I do not even want to open my retirement plan quarterly statement.

2020-03-19 16:44:18,"Dear Congress,

Please say yes to providing assistance to those who lose their paychecks -- so they can pay for rent, food, and healthcare. Please say no to corporate bailouts. Corporations are NOT people.

Workers need to practice social distancing. No one should feel compelled to go to work in order to put food on the table, if their job depends on congregating with ten or more people. And no company should feel compelled to stay open under the same circumstances. This is literally a matter of life and death.

I am not anti-business. Corporations (large and small) will also suffer. But bailouts are not the answer. Interest rates are at all-time lows, with the Fed overnight rate back down to Great Recession levels of 0%. Offer bridge loans, or just stop the clock temporarily on debt service for a few months. That is what the Fed and the low interest rate environment has to offer to keep businesses afloat. And the private sector can do this on its own (I'm talking to you, Jamie Dimon and other bank executives.) Just pause debt service. But no more government bailouts."

It will be accepted wisdom that a future disease could create more market disruptions; that governments should be prepared; that social safety nets should cover more people; that regulations of goods, and services should be increased; global supply chains will be looked on with disfavor, and on and on.

The days of big profit will have ended, in other words, and the markets will rise again, but this time to a lower level that more closely resembles the actual valuation of the companies on their indexes.  The number is actually a little lower than where the markets are now."
2020-03-19 16:48:29,"Trump says the economy will experience a rapid fall before it climbs back up rapidly.  Well, that isn't exactly prophetic inasmuch as the economy has already fallen.  And he can only hope that it climbs back up quickly in an election year.  I don't consider myself an economic whiz but it is obvious that the economy won't rebound until the virus peaks and is under control.  That could be months away or even a year.  Bottom line:  Trump doesn't know any more than a student who just failed Economics 101."

We picked up stray tin and nails in the street gutters - to be made into weapons.  We had ration books and victory gardens to save food for the military.  And we had FDR in charge of the government.

The collateral damage of this criminal onslaught of disinformation,  incompetence, failure to perform, lies and criminal activity is that the average American, particularly Trump's base, no longer believes TRUTH or even knows how to recognize it.

If they want to go around and lick door handles to prove their loyalty to Trump, have fun.

The fact is that a great deal of money has been taken out of circulation due to reasons of people now being unemployed, businesses being limited to hours they can be open, and the stock market loosing a tremendous amount of value.  Add to this the enormous amount of money the Federal government will be sending out, trying to keep this economy from going into a tailspin.  And if the COVID virus really gets a foothold, this will become the Italy scenario.

And fathom this for a moment.  The person who was advising Trump what to do, his only qualification was that he married his daughter.

It's one thing for the federal government to engage in long-term borrowing and spending on infrastructure, renewable energy, overhauling the health care system, etc., but businesses really need to be solvent before speculating; need to build up cash reserves to carry out their activities; and not be dependent upon borrowing simply to exist.

""We shall make cuts to public assistance programs and impose work requirements so that our supporters know that we believe those on public assistance are a criminal class.""

2020-03-19 17:35:18,"Buried somewhere among my possessions is an old brokerage statement from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Beane dating back to March 1956 that records for posterity the fact that I purchased 20 shares of Royal Dutch -- the oil company  that is now Royal Dutch Shell -- for about $600.

I was 16 years old at the time, and my father was already counseling me to lay some money aside for my old age. 

I can’t recall exactly where the money came from -- my only job until that time was as an assistant summer camp counselor for which I received the grand total of $50 -- but some of it was probably bar mitzvah gifts, and I’m guessing that my father gave me the rest for my birthday.

Here I am today smack dab in the middle of a worldwide health and financial crisis highlighted by plunging oil prices, a teetering stock market and a mentally compromised President, so the question naturally arises, what became of those 20 shares.

And the short answer is, I still have them. 

How much those 20 shares are worth today I couldn’t tell you, but counting a few share splits along the way and dividends that were frequently reinvested to purchase additional shares, it is surely a tidy sum, notwithstanding the deeply corrosive effects of 64 years of inflation and the recent steep fall of the share price.

The moral of this story being that if you still have some loose cash available to you, buy a few stocks.

Now a microscopic virus closes factories, reduces pollution, cleans rivers, reduces accidents, reduces consumption, cancels carnivals. The stock market falls but perhaps accidents, assaults on the street, femicides and perhaps domestic violence have decreased. The virus has proven that in a bacteriological war no country would be safe and that changing the consequences of our follies is possible. On the other hand, if we add the deaths from violence, natural disasters, including famines and droughts, there are many more than from the virus. They say that it all started because in China they eat exotic animals, in China most do not know the Bible where it says which animals are edible and which are not, it also says about the cleaning of kitchen utensils and personal hygiene. (Chap. 11 and 15 of Leviticus), the transgression of these commandments has brought about so many human and material losses. Will we keep throwing stones over our heads? Somehow the virus has managed to unite the world in a common fight, uniting ideas, resources, protection measures. When will we understand that Jesus' command to “Love one another as I have loved you is for our individual and global good?"

1.  Sen. Richard Burr was secretly warning his North Carolina business cronies some time ago that things would get bad, well before the public was given that information.  If we still have a functioning SEC, I hope it will examine the timing of stock trades of Burr and his buddies, not to mention those done by members of the administration and their families.
2.  As governors joined with the rest of us in social distancing, Trump and his advisors were piled up around the microphone at this morning’s news conference.  It almost looked like a cheerleading exercise.  The upside is that if this bunch had to self-quarantine because of it, the nation would probably be better off."

China has reached a plateau more than three months later and they are still in complete lockdown. These tiny flickers of optimism are good psychological defense mechanisms.

Opportunities for transformational change to core industrial assets are remarkably rare - almost always involving massive reconstruction programs after major catastrophic events and wars. It never happens when markets are roaring.

Virtually all of the objections, negotiation tactics and bargaining chips are off the table - for at least some brief window of opportunity.

Supply-chains are broken, demand has evaporated. Entire industries are bankrupt and governments globally are poised to take equity stakes in numerous systemically important firms.

Workers are laid off, home-bound and receiving public assistance. Social and cultural systems have received a major shock - people are adapting to drastic behavior changes and reset expectations.

Assuring the health and psychological well-being of the population is a critical leadership responsibility at this juncture.

It is essential to provide a positive future vision and set of long-term goals as people realign their lives.

The last thing they need to hear about while struggling with health and household insecurity is all the billion-dollar bailouts to the rich. 

The absolute last thing the world needs is bailouts to the petroleum industry.

The president and his task force need to consider the devastating economic impact of local governments led by mayors and governors. There already are strict rules for sanitary handling of food, they can add social distancing and other protocols for doing business in hygienic conditions. 

We are not a socialist country where workers get paid wages for not working unless techies can work from home. That is why jobless claims have shot up and people are being laid off by the 1000s. Thanks to companies that are hiring like amazing Amazon, the employment sector is shifting and the job market is retooling. I am considering Mahatma Gandhi  style non violent non cooperation to end the March madness by the end of March and fully open businesses with BUSINESS AS USUAL by setting aside the draconian requirements that are choking businesses just like Corona virus chokes its terminal stage victim to death when the damaged lung can no longer breathe.

The US infection rate is a straight line, up, and across the nation, we've only tested about 60,000 people, and are shuttering hundreds of thousands of small businesses, events, cities. 

The difference? Competent leadership. 

They were prepared, they had mobilization plans, stockpiled resources, they informed the public immediately, the public responded, they pulled resources together, and deployed them creatively and effectively.

The warning from authorities is specifically for heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, or immune compromise.  You have narrowed respiratory to ""asthma"".  Dr. Fauci specifically said w/resp to asthma that it was a risk factor only if your asthma interacts with respiratory ailments (not everybody's does nor is this coincident with severity).

2020-03-19 19:19:34,"Another thing to consider in terms of stock buybacks is that some companies that have suffered large stock price losses in the current market now become targets for so called ""activist"" investors.  Companies can find themselves vulnerable to these type of short term investors depending on their overall corporate health, the amount of liquid cash they have and other corporate assets (e.g. real estate holdings).  Activist investors seek to exert influence on corporate policy at such companies by accumulating a significant enough stock position to put themselves on the board.  Once they have that influence they then will push the board to mandate a share buyback or asset sale to increase the share value and then the ""activist"" sells its shares and makes a profit.  The interest of the ""activist"" is short term profits and not the long term health of the company.  That type of activity needs to be restricted, especially now.  I personally know of a company that is having to simultaneously think about the best way to allocate it's cash resources to maintain the health of the company, its employees and weather the storm while at the same time worrying about whether it should use those same resources to fend off the potential of an ""activist"" takeover."

World War II is the best road map we have. To win the war, four things needed to happen immediately that would completely upend American life.

Private factories would have to halt production of everyday goods – cars, clothes, appliances – and retool to build planes, tanks, and guns. This was done by federal order. Fewer than 200 civilian vehicles were built in the United States from 1942 to 1945. Every assembly line was devoted to war.

Second, wages had to be stabilized. No big raises, no big cuts. FDR told the nation in 1942: “Do you work for wages? You will have to forego higher wages for your particular job for the duration of the war.”

Third, everyday goods had to be rationed. Gasoline, sugar, rubber, steel – limits were placed on how much and when you could buy.

Fourth, taxes would be raised. Income would be effectively capped. The rich must be made to pay much higher taxes.

Then we can devote every resource to defeating the enemy."

How well did that work out?  We had a short, one time ""sugar high"" on that ""free money"" and the deficit took a YUUUUUGE jump upward, to the tune of a TRILLION dollars, with ongoing added deficits for years to come.

At this point, the day of ""free money"" for the fat cats (for example, Apple is sitting in hundreds of BILLIONS in CASH) should be over.  

If money should be handed out, it needs to go first to people who will be unemployed for a long time due to no fault of their own, and to state and local governments who need the money to pay for all manner of medical care, including medical professionals, equipment, facilities, medicines, and supplies.

The way to handle the big companies that are going to lose revenues because people will stop spending is to put them into a form of Federal ""receivership"" or ""fiduciary guardianship"" (for example for failure to pay taxes due, and without the possibility of the government as fiduciary to ""sell them off"" to new owners for small money), and then to resurrect them when we get rid of the more immediate medical problems posed by the pandemic.

Here's the deal: It's a virus. It's basically a *natural* disaster. No amount of planning and no amount of government can prevent nature from running its course. Of course there are things we can and should do, but the virus doesn't care if you're an authoritarian left-wing state like China or an ""advanced industrial nation"" like the U.K. or Italy. So far, the socialized systems have proven neither better nor worse than other systems, so let's stop playing politics, stop buying all the toilet paper, and help the system that we do have function at its best."

Republican Senator Dumped Up to $1.6 Million of Stock After Reassuring Public About Coronavirus Preparedness [HuffPost]

Intelligence Chair Richard Burr’s selloff came around the time he was receiving daily briefings on the health threat.

Soon after he offered public assurances that the government was ready to battle the coronavirus, the powerful chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, sold off a significant percentage of his stocks, unloading between $582,029 and $1.56 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 29 separate transactions.

As the head of the intelligence committee, Burr, a North Carolina Republican, has access to the government’s most highly classified information about threats to America’s security. His committee was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time, according to a Reuters story.

A week after Burr’s sales, the stock market began a sharp decline and has lost about 30% since.

On Thursday, Burr came under fire after NPR obtained a secret recording from Feb. 27, in which the lawmaker gave a VIP group at an exclusive social club a much more dire preview of the economic impact of the coronavirus than what he had told the public."

2020-03-20 13:35:41,"Unfortunately as this crisis goes on the lines will get longer. And a larger crisis looms, Who will be there to help distribute food when we are all afraid of contaminating each other? The time to donate to food pantries is now."
2020-03-20 13:44:35,"This is the exact moment- if there ever was one in this country - to absolutely and unconditionally assist others - who have far less.  We are all going to have to pull together to get through this - and it is going to get a bit worse before it gets better.  How about one small anonymous kindness today - just to move away from isolated self-absorption? And then tomorrow - just one anonymous kindness...and then the next...and so it goes until it becomes a habit!  And, by the way, happy first day of spring.  Go take a walk!"

2020-03-20 14:22:07,"Many of us have skipped meals so our kids could eat, myself included.  Perhaps now that we've got a global pandemic on our hands and food insecurity is an issue being discussed outside of social work circles, we can develop economic policies so that nobody has to go hungry in the wealthiest nation in recorded history."
2020-03-20 14:39:27,"This family's experience with hunger echoes my own. My husband was disabled after having had a heart attack. It was 2002 and we were pretty destitute, even with me working. There was a summer ""feeding program"" at the local school. Each of my children was given a wonderful noon meal, which they had to eat on site. Any crumbs were thrown away by the program and so I got smart and wore a smock with pockets. Bits of cheese, etc., were surreptitiously saved for later. It was heavenly to have a slice of cheese of my own. We planted a garden, gleaned fruit from orchards of friends, cooked dandelions homegrown from the yard; had interesting meals! Food insecurity is real. Every family has unique circumstances and we can't know their realities from on high. Food for children and parents is vital and food programs must be in place, without shaming, to those in need. 
Even with a PhD in place, our family was stricken with hunger. My children, later, told me that their tummies were always hurting when they were young. I never knew this! We need to ensure that basic food is available to all."
2020-03-20 13:57:27,"This family, which probably doesn’t pay any income tax, would be one of the 22 million left out of the Republicans stimulis plan. No check for them. Mitch McConnell is such a nice person."

2020-03-20 14:32:45,"While I sympathize with the plight of this family, and particularly those kids, the real tragedy is bringing that many children into the world. Children don't just befall people like some unavoidable stroke of ill luck. Choices were made, and consequences must be born out. When heart-string-tugging articles like this are written about large impoverished families, why is the choice to continue having children explored so infrequently? Are we to feel deep compassion because these parents are too incompetent to have expressed agency over one of life's most momentous choices?"
2020-03-20 14:07:25,This is infuriating. We're not living in a civilized society when parents are starving so that their kids can eat and our leadership doesn't think the situation needs an immediate remedy. Our country is suffering from a poverty of spirit.
2020-03-20 14:11:37,"Unfortunately Mitch McConnell’s aid package would not help this woman - she’s too poor. The money goes to those earning $50 - 75,000 a year, including those still working. The service worker, the gig worker, the freelance workers would get nothing. Applying for unemployment will require trips to the local offices presumably now closed. Inequality reigns in Mitch’s Senate. Remember in November and vote Mitch, Lindsay, and those opposed to helping American workers out of office."
2020-03-20 14:04:01,"I think the continued meal service is a wonderful thing. I’m glad these kids get a meal but if they qualify for free meals then the family also qualifies for food stamps. There’s no mention of the food they’re able to buy with that program. 

There also needs to be some education taking place here. Near the end of the article the woman is going without food but having a monster energy drink. Those cost $2-4 each depending on size and where they were purchased. She could make a meal of rice and tuna or have soup with crackers for less than that drink. Food dollars need to be spent wisely, now more than ever."

2020-03-20 13:47:11,Heartbreaking story. The government must act swiftly and urgently. How can each of us help? Can NYT revive its Neediest Cases fund? Even a modest contribution by those who can give will help those most in need.
2020-03-20 14:25:03,"Hopefully the covid-19 pandemic will teach enduring lessons:
1. a universal social safety net funded by a fair taxation system is the norm around the world for civilized, 21st century nations; &
2.  Mothers in the richest countries should not subsist on one meal per day of processed foods that a US conservative, so-called Christian govt subsidizes for corporate profits so that her children can have several meals of unhealthy processed foods."
2020-03-20 13:53:15,"Something about this story is off.  

If she’s disabled, there’s a chance she’s drawing a VA check.  For every disabled vet who doesn’t get a check, there’s another who does.  Husband, six kids, 30% rating means nearly $700 a month.  

She also meets the state’s criteria for SNAP, even with the GOP’s drastic cuts.  That means up to $1,100 a month in food benefits.  

I have close friends with kids who have lived or are living in poverty.  They don’t limit themselves to one meal a day.  They find ways to stretch grains, beans, cheap cuts of meat, and sale vegetables.  When my family lived in poverty (for more than a decade), food was my parents’ first priority.  And they ate, too.  

Martyrdom isn’t going to help her kids."
2020-03-20 13:58:03,"Older children do notice when Mom is not eating.  This will upend their feeling of being secure in their home. That’s when they realize things are getting bad.  I have worked with families living in poverty, empty refrigerators, bare cupboards, waiting for the food stamps to come so they can shop.  And they worked, sometimes two to three jobs, they just couldn’t keep up as things like rent and gas got more expensive.  When I would bring food to them from the food pantry, one family told me,”we are ok, give this to someone who needs it”.  And they needed it, all that was left was milk and bread.  This is where the safety nets should not be further slashed.  There are those who truly need the help, please donate what you can to your local food pantries."
2020-03-20 14:33:23,This is reality for so many people every day. These stories are sad but they are like the toy drives and the food drives at Christmas -- being thoughtful towards those in need for a few days a year doesn't address the structural issues that drive child poverty.

2020-03-20 14:35:53,"Aside from the school lunch, wouldn't they be eligible for the SNAP program?  I hope this family has looked into any programs that might help them."
2020-03-20 14:42:45,"This is why a $1000 payment to Americans is not nearly enough. What is needed is a concerted plan of action that can keep Americans - the consumers that drive the economy - above water.

To that end, I propose the following: 1. Expand unemployment benefits to cover everyone who earns up to $250,000.00/yr., payable at their regular salary, not capped. Also, the duration should be extended up to two years. 2. Provide immediate Medicaid eligibility and coverage to anyone who loses their health insurance, or who does not have it all. 3. Place a moratotium on all foreclosures, evictions, and seizures of assets for people getting behind on their debt payments. 4. Free tuition to public college or a trade school for those who want/need to change careers. 5. Set up free day care centers for parents who have to work and no longer have day care providers. Long term: 1. Re-enact the WPA and CCC to provide jobs and job training, as well as housing, clothing, and food as needed for the workers. 2. For all companies who accept loans/bailouts, they must agree to return all foreign based operations and presence to the U.S. within 5 years. No matter how much money you throw at Wall St. and Corporate America, it's not going to do any good if the consumers - a.k.a. workers - can't afford to buy anything.

Our leaders have had their priorities exactly upside down for decades, it's urgent that they now reverse them."

Now, however, the panic buying and job loss stresses those in deed more than all others.

Why has not our ""Most Stable Genius"" and self professed Christian,   along with his shadow Pence, a Christian fundamentalist,  instructed the Army reserves to activate, drive trucks to food processing plants and surplus food depots (e.g. corporate farms store various dairy products, eggs, and grains)  and immediately begin distributing food to those in need?       Why are they not getting grain to mills for conversion to flour?

Why?   Because the W.H. is dysfunctional, cares little for those who do not donate to re-election campaigns, and the Senate is too busy finagling tax cuts and bail-outs for businesses."

Many of us have pledged to hand over our government checks to local outreach resources. We are all pulling together."

2020-03-20 13:56:54,I hope people who can do so will remember to donate money to food banks and soup kitchens throughout the country. People are suffering. I know a Catholic priest who tells me that the food bank that his church works with is seeing 15X the demand it did just a few weeks ago.
2020-03-20 14:05:35,"The Grapes of Wrath, version 2020.

The Trump Administration had originally been on course to cut SNAP (food stamp) eligibility before the Coronavirus crisis, but the House bill approved by the Senate and signed by Trump specifically expands SNAP for the duration of the crisis by $400 million through September 2021 and sets up a nationwide waiver on Trump-GOP work requirements.

The GOP and Trump weren't happy about the Democratic compassion and humanity in the bill, so they reluctantly approved it.

Nice GOPeople."
2020-03-20 14:12:50,"A heartbreaking story to be sure. But instead of seeking help solely from the government—which should, to be clear, provide at least some relief—why not acknowledge the partial responsibility of this couple, at least for getting themselves into this predicament?

Six children? In this day and age? On that salary—or lack thereof?

Have you heard of climate change? Have you looked at your bank accounts? Do you know that a nutritiously balanced, proper meal rarely features biscuits and pasta? Are there even any books in that household?

Let's see some birth control, either personally implemented or state mandated. Or, alternatively, maybe we should put a cap on the number of children eligible for welfare. Maybe with fewer children growing up in poverty we can flatten the adulthood poverty/obesity/crime curves. And then the taxpayers won't have to support the mistakes of religious zealots—either because those mistakes won't exist or won't be eligible for support."
2020-03-20 15:09:00,"The nation never had a strong social safety net and Republicans simply toe it apart.  They oppose all services like health care, SS, SNAP, professional affordable child care, maternity and paid sick leave for people at the bottom of the pecking order. Paid leave and paid sick and maternity leave is for the people who need it least.

2020-03-20 14:32:39,I think the $1200 per person idea should be continued as long as the pandemic exists. It is not as if the money is being flushed away. It will be used to buy things that keep stores and other businesses operating. Our economy depends on consumer spending. I hope Biden and a Democratic House and Senate repeal that tax giveaway the traitorous Republicans granted themselves and their pals.

This epidemic is not fake news and people really are dying.  So here's where the rubber meets the road: give this family (and all those facing shortages) adequate food stamps, meals from school and food supplement boxes from the food bank.  Generous portions for all everyone.  Save the judgment for God.  There is no rational excuse for anyone to go hungry in America."
2020-03-20 14:59:30,"Thank you for highlighting the reality for most Americans!  Yet again, the GOP proposes tax breaks for large corporations, while those with less suffer."
2020-03-20 15:05:59,Well the media has a lot to answer for regarding their coverage of Donald Trump and congressional GOP - but we'll come back to that later: Now is the time for government & the media industrial complex to do the hard work but essential work of being a conduit that enables our most vulnerable citizens (which could & will be all of us soon) to survive. Do your job.
2020-03-20 14:40:02,"Many congregations, like ours, have congregants bring something to drop on the food pantry donation table each time they come to services or religious school.  With those events going virtual, I assume food pantry supplies are plummeting."
2020-03-20 14:52:03,Seems an easy solution is to include an extra 1-2 meals for parents.
2020-03-20 14:44:07,And yet when profressives suggest we look at income inequality they are maligned and called everything in the book. There is no reason on earth why one person lives on billions while a vast number have to stand in line to eat. Something has to change but only the citizen can make necessary changes by making politicians work for all Americans. Vote. Pay attention to what your representatives are doing to ensure that hunger is eradicated by providing laborers with decent wages and security. This isn’t about a mansion for everyone: it’s a plea for simple decency.
2020-03-20 15:03:14,"The biggest cause of poverty is early marriage and early and often kids. If you forgo education and a career to do these things you more than likely will be poor and a need public assistance forever. This is a great story if you are interested in an emotion packed story with an agenda, but even with out a pandemic, the lessons are clear and they have nothing to do with a virus. Neither the tax payer nor the planet can afford this anymore."
2020-03-20 14:44:30,"I can’t be too sympathetic with a mother who says she is disabled, can’t work, and at one point was even homeless but has 5 kids under the age of 10, some apparently with last names other than her current husband. Meanwhile many families of child-bearing ages, including my own sons and daughters, would like big families but decide not to because they can’t afford it. Many other families are in desperate straits financially for the on-going variety of reasons reported every day in the news, long before the covid-19 threat. Those responsible families are the ones who should get help."
2020-03-20 14:58:50,"I'm glad the schools are willing and able to provide this.

Before I became a teacher I was volunteering at a Title I school and asked if I could go and look at the breakfast program, which I had never heard of.   Children were in the cafeteria eating breakfast, and lots of parents were outside the doors, watching.  Children were not allowed to take food out with them, and parents were not allowed inside.  (Children were putting apples and such in the garbage on their way outside.)  I asked the staff a question about that and they didn't want to talk about it.

Later, I asked the principal what was going on.  He told me that kids weren't allowed to take food outside, because some of their parents would make their kids bring them part of their breakfast.  Parents weren't allowed inside for the same reason, some of them would eat the food meant for the children. 

Children can't learn if they are hungry.  We have forced our schools to become social service agencies.  Hopefully, when the pandemic ends, we can do a better job of distributing resources in our country.  But schools should be about educating, not about providing social services, and enforcing rules about who gets what to eat."
2020-03-20 15:10:17,"This story is heart wrenching and is representative of so many families.  I have read in this comments section comments regarding the family's six children.  We don't know if all the children are theirs.  Are some of these children nieces and nephews, children from families which had no way to care for them?  Just as one woman with bare cupboards declined food because she thought there were others who needed it more, so maybe this family is sharing what little they have.  The issue is that in this rich country people are going hungry. 
 This is the outrage.  November is coming.  Make the right choice."
2020-03-20 15:24:17,"Each of us tends, at times, to judge and/or disapprove of different realities from our own, as if equal choices and opportunity are available to all.  Sadly, they are not, and poverty and food scarcity exist for millions on a daily basis, even without a pandemic taking root.  It is dispiriting to read the judgmental comments by some readers. Ms. Mossbarger is a disabled Army vet.  That alone should garner our gratitude, respect, and humility. She and her family - and countless others in similar straits - need urgent help, not judgment, now."
2020-03-20 15:05:32,"NY Times is a great news source and helps families at holidays.

You're either part of the problem or part of the solution and right now the plutocrats that buy and control the politicians to pass the laws that make some people rich and most people poor are the problem.

2020-03-20 15:11:42,"Grew up in a large family of nine, but what we saw was inequality of food at the family table when my father eating well and rest of us not so well. I was undernourished, thin, and the smallest child in my class for years without regular checkups. We children got for a typical meal - a couple of tablespoons of canned veggies, a piece of fried bologna, and milk. I would go to neighbors or relatives when they were cooking and said it smelled so good, and then they fed me. So I see that children have big portions in front of them which is good. We grew up before the public school lunch program or WIC. Once those programs were in place, and my family was eligible, my parents were too proud to enroll. So I would go in line for the free cheese in high school and bring it home or work in the restaurant and catering businesses and bring food home. Yes, it was like that back then before the food programs with poor large families. Parents back then did not have birth control, but today they do and many large families today will not do birth control largely due to religious reasons. And when I finally went to work early in my teens at the age of 14 and paid my way through college and on scholarship, finally caught up with what my true size would have been - tallest person in my class in college."
2020-03-20 15:13:40,"Within the last month or two, I have read in several places - papers, magazines, etc. - that up to 40% of our food is wasted - at home, in restaurants, may be on the farms - and at the same time people cannot get enough to eat!

I try my best to avoid wastage at home but even in my own home, everyone is not happily cooperative - oh, it's only a few dollars; throw it away, it is past its date; etc."

These families need relief NOW -- more food, moratorium on bills for necessities (rent, phone, car). Reform is focus on what will lift up our working class -- education and access to health care not tied to a person's age, job, or income.  Last, reform could look like help in registering to vote, and access to unbiased information on which party is actually better for the working class -- every member of the working class.  Don't need to say which party, do I?"

As far as the ""healthy"" meal you can fix, and why do they have so many children, please get off your horse.  This isn't the time for it.  We all need to pull together to get past this.  The kids didn't ask to be born.  Please don't punish them"

2020-03-20 15:43:39,"The Trump administration is echoing the philosophy of Laissez-Faire in mid-19th century Britain.  A million people starved in Ireland while the government did nothing.  There was enough food to go around, but ""prevailing ideologies among the political élite and the middle classes strongly militated against heavy and sustained relief."" 

""What, then, were the ideologies that held the British political élite and the middle classes in their grip, and largely determined the decisions not to adopt the possible relief measures outlined above? There were three in particular-the economic doctrines of laissez-faire, the Protestant evangelical belief in divine Providence, and the deep-dyed ethnic prejudice against the Catholic Irish to which historians have recently given the name of 'moralism'."" (BBC)

When will the Trump grapple with the moral indefensibility of  doing nothing to prevent today's imminent mass death?"
2020-03-20 15:47:51,"For some of us, this is what freedom looks like. If you are baffled by the decision tree that led to this family portrait, I urge you to volunteer for a full 8 hour day at least twice a year in a low-income, rural school. Not to reform or even understand, but to build bridges of mutuality and exchange. Reintegrating our identity across rural-urban, educational and class divides is kind of the only way forward right now."
2020-03-20 15:55:47,"I am glad journalists are writing these stories.  People need to understand what a huge population of this country looks like.  I am also glad there are so many people volunteering and helping to make sure the millions of children living in poverty in this country have meals while out of school.  School, the place where these children get meals.  Imagine that."

2020-03-20 15:30:31,"It is up to the readers of the NYT to have sympathy or empathy. It is up to the NYT itself to provide readers with information. As others have pointed out there is no mention of possible other sources of income; VA disability benefits, SNAP benefits, etc.. Furthermore, in a story that is really about the family’s financial predicament, there is no mention of that family’s spending habits or whether they have tried to save any money for a “rainy day.” Without such context, my unfortunate reaction is to withhold compassion, thinking that this is just another liberal media sob story. This is unfortunate because people, and perhaps this family, may deserve complete and total compassion. You know, it’s funny, in real life the people that I know who find themselves in financial difficulty almost always bear some or most of the blame for their predicament. But not in the world of liberal journalism, where everyone is only a victim, not a responsible actor in their own drama. The NYT should do its job which is to give readers the information upon which to make a realistic assessment about the story's subject matter."
2020-03-20 16:10:48,In my area of Texas the schools have pick up breakfast and lunch and the school district is even busing food to pick up sites for those who live farther away from the schools. Some restaurants are serving free breakfast and lunch for school age children. The food banks are doing pick up food distribution and our local free meal program is still serving food. People are sharing what they have on facebook when someone says they have something specific they need. I'm worried that services might break down as things get worse. I had to stop volunteering at our local food bank because of health reasons. I worry about the clients.
2020-03-20 13:40:03,"In Korea when we see poor people with kids we look at disapproval at the parents. If you are poor, you have no business having kids. Those kids did nothing wrong. They did not ask to be born.Why should they suffer because some selfish people wanted to reproduce? If you can not afford to give kids a good life, you have no business bringing them into a world of poverty. Really, Americans need to shame poor people from having kids.

They appear to me to be good people who are trying to raise their children as best as they can.  Who are you people?  What gives you the right to make such mean comments?  Who are you to judge?You are part of what is wrong with this country right now.......the increasing gap between the haves and the have nots, the NIMBYS and the NOTES (Not Over There Either).  Readers of this article can tell which side you people are on.  These are human beings you are talking about, just like you and me, and they are living, like you and me, in the richest country in the world.  Please try, if you are capable, to have some kindness and empathy, to the extent you are capable.  If you are religious, think about your comments in the terms of what your religion taught you, if you were paying attention when the lessons were given to you.  If you do attend religious services, next time you are sitting in a pew in your place of worship, think about this Mom in Texas, and her husband, and think about their children.  Just........think.....that there for the grace of your God go you."
2020-03-20 15:30:08,"Welcome to the realities of living in Texas, a state where 20 plus years of Republican governors have waged an open war on the lower middle class and poor in the name of fiscal integrity.

There is frankly little or no safety net in this state for people like the Mossbargers.  Republican legislators crow non-stop about no new taxes and have little if any empathy for anyone other than the business interests that fund their re-election.

By the way, they make up the crowd that for 6 weeks, screamed that the Corona virus was fake news spread by Democrats and the so called left wing news media.

These pinheads ignore science in schools (evolution) and as to the environment (global warming), so why is it surprising they ignored clear trends in China and Europe regarding the spread of this disease and the need to get ahead of it.

This is also the crowd that refuses to expand medicaid, waged an open war on the ACA and has stood by and watched as hospitals in rural Texas fail at an alarming rate.

Of course, they are the first to run to their own doctor when they feel ill, the first to obtain testing and the first to assure adequate healthcare for their families.

Their answer to their failure of leadership.  Racism as always.  Only now its not the Hispanic immigrants.

They say it is the Chinese virus that is the cause.  Good job-you horrible excuses for human beings."

2020-03-20 16:06:50,"We have members of Congress making vast sums of money while they have constituents going hungry.

Let's face it, the Republicans don't care about these people and the Dems had a choice between someone who says the current system is fine with just a little fine tuning and someone who said we need a new system.  

If people in this country wanted things to be different, they would be.  But white people would rather go hungry than think that blacks and Latinos might be being fed even if it meant they would be fed too."
2020-03-20 16:09:30,"Heartbreaking.

It heartened me to see the children praying. I believe that God will provide. My wife and I were in the store the other day and trying to only buy what we need, for the exact reason Mr. Spahn says: if those who can afford to just buy everything they can, there won't be anything for anyone else. There was some frozen chicken dinners that we do sometimes buy, and I asked my wife if we should buy them while we had the chance. She said, ""Honey, we don't need them right now. God will provide."" To which I replied, ""Sometimes he provides *right now*. It doesn't always have to be in the future.""

I guess my point is this: I could take my $1,200 check from the government and pay a part of my taxes or a credit card bill. But I don't need to. I could wind up financially better off after all of this. Here's my challenge to those of us who aren't going to go hungry: take that check and give it to someone who needs it. And I mean NEEDS it. We have a friend who just got laid off who lives paycheck to paycheck. She's getting my Trump Check. (She doesn't know it yet).

To those who have food and can pay their bills through this: give that $1,200 to someone who doesn't and can't. You don't even have to know them.

2020-03-20 16:09:36,"A lot of people feel moved to help in some way after reading or hearing about a specific person's situation -- but helping that person specifically isn't always practical or possible.

One way to help people just like this family all over the country is with a cash donation to your local food pantry. Thanks to bulk buying, food pantries can often stretch each dollar you donate into $3 worth of food for struggling people and families. They're a vital resource in every community at all times, but especially now when people's livelihoods are being threatened by uncertainty and business closures."

Our pantry was not stocked to feed 3 teens 24 hours a day. I am more accustomed to buying breakfast and dinner items as they eat at school during the week.
So please do not make harsh comments about this family. They made choices based upon the children eating at school - just like we did. Give everyone some time to settle into a routine."

Poverty is widespread, from Miami to Seattle, hidden behind huge skyscrapers, massive developments, urban sprawl. Republicans and DemoRepublicans have caused its spread with tax breaks and health breaks given to the rich who made it their goal in life to control our ""plantation economics"" we find ourselves in today.

Student Loan Debt is highest its every been, and many that live in poverty, no matter if you give 1200 a month, will have to turn around and pay their student loan and try to stay above water.  No one has mentioned cancelling that DEBT to alleviate their poverty.  Did Elizabeth and Nancy forget to fight for that or was that one of bargaining chips.

If we are all in this together, then it doesn't feel like it for millions who live below the Rich Velvet poverty line. Bernie should not quit, this is a wakeup call;everyone should now know he is right about who owns the power, and its not the Most of Us."

2020-03-20 15:27:17,"This is heart-breaking. I am hearing similar stores across the country from friends who are witnessing child after child who is wondering where their next meal will come from because the schools are closed.  I don't want to make this a political story - but it is. It's also a story about something defective in our psychology.
Why why why is this okay? Why is it we expect so little from the wealthiest and most economically powerful country in the world? 

A few facts - why are so many of you advocating for a Presidential candidate who will change almost nothing? Who said he will veto Medicare for all if it comes to his desk? Why do you think health care must be profited from? Why is it okay for just 10 people in the USA to be worth more than 200,000,000 (yes, 200 million) Americans as these childrens fight to not starve to death! 

Please stop with the nonsensical argument 'the lesser of two evils' w/ regard to getting rid of Trump. Not only is it a philosophically naive and failed argument - it also doesn't work. It doesn't work for those who NEED food, who need economic equality, who deserve societal safety nets. Spare me the justifications born of a failure to empathize and internalize how bad it is for too many...because that's what it comes down to.

We've had 50 years of Republicans (a lost cause) & neoliberals who push an agenda that harms Americans. Full stop. And some of you want more of it? No matter what you say to yourselves - it's wrong.

This couple represents two people coming together to pool their shared, yet insufficient, resources. As for the children, no child asks to be born into this world. The decision to have children is often complicated and illogical following no dictated or prescribed rules.

 I hope this young lady gets the help she so deservedly needs."

Instead of understanding that this is going to be the fate of MILLIONS of everyday Americans as the Covid-19 crisis destroys the mostly meager savings of low wage workers, writers chide the parents for even having children.  Shame on you!
They only way we are going to survive the current public health crisis and economic disaster is by working together to support each other.   And having compassion for those vulnerable people who are always the first to be affected."

Instead of denying herself, Ms. Mossbarger could make herself a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of  tea for the cost of that cherry Dr. Pepper (which is quite pricey and provides zero nutrition). Admittedly oatmeal is not a luxurious breakfast, but it is far better than nothing. Add a boiled egg, and you've got a lasting meal."

So disheartening to see so many comments chastising this family for having 6 children. I would bet that many of the posters grew up in a time - not long ago - when having 6 kids (or 4 or 5) in a family was normal. AND most were able to live - put food on their table, have the basics - on ONE income.

The real culprit here is the massive shift in wealth to the top and away from the middle/lower income rings in society.

All monotheistic faith preaches the imperative to care for the “Poor amongst us.” Sadly, belief in God often doesn’t result in acting as She/He suggests.

Thus it isn’t news, that the poor are hardest hit. My only other experience with a concentration at the bottom of the economic pile came in 1968 while living in the central ward of Newark, NJ. The whiter, richer, more educated are clueless how desperate life can be.

I live in a poor, tiny, isolated town. We 3,000 people live on ≈$13,000 less and are ≈12 years older than average. Sixteen percent have under $10,000 a year.

We who came here for our love of this extraordinary desert are scarcely better off than the survivors. Social Security, maybe a small pension, keeps us alive. We have little. We want little.

Those with education and wider experience are more responsible. Few of us are “Christian” but most acknowledge that we must care for our neighbor. Compassion isn’t limited to dogma.

What can we do? Little. The epidemic hasn’t yet arrived, but it will. Border Patrol, wall workers, wealthy running for enclaves in Mexico. We try to provide fact over panic, concern above fear, and the reminder that no matter how dark it is, laughter always wins.

Would any of you guys posting these comments agree with me that by the mere fact we can read the NYTimes ... it is likely that we are among the privileged in this country?  So here we sit, using our resources to pass judgement on this family (and thousands of others).

Today, I will challenge myself to do something other than type these comments.  I will do something that might make a difference to those in need around me.  It will not matter to me whether ""they put themselves"" in a particular situation.  I will try to do something sustainable, but I will improve at least one family's life before I go home.  I am confident that I will be joining thousands of others who made this same decision long before I did; just doing what is right when no one is looking.  Because most of us can and should.

There are millions of families in the same situation, probably some right near you.  Everyone sending a check to one family after a story is like our lottery system, one person winning millions of dollars instead of many, many winners receiving $30,000 or more.

As for the comments second-guessing these parents' decision making abilities. People do sometimes making bad decisions.... I'm not sure how I would be able to make an absolute conclusion from reading an article. Regardless- we're past that mindset being effective in this, and similar situations.

Maybe commenters who can sidestep the family’s financial stress and the deaths of the father’s 20-year old sons – maybe those people should never have been born. The one in the White House, who fosters misery with his cruel policies, is quite enough."
2020-03-20 17:06:43,Praying isn't going to get you more food; all the fat cats in the church hierarchy will have plenty of food. Maybe they should practise what they preach.
2020-03-20 16:55:24,"This is a question, not a judgment, and I pose it because I sympathize with Summer Mossbarger. Has she applied for food stamps? I do not see any reason why she/her family would not qualify for food stamps of some value. Also, while mothers do sacrifice for their children, it is not in her children's best interests for her to subsist on just one meal a day; they need her to be healthy and alert. If each of the six children were to give her even two bites of their own lunches, she would be able to have one additional small meal per day. Please, Mrs. Mossbarger, apply for food stamps today, and ask your children to share a bit with their mother."
2020-03-20 16:56:38,"When the ""wealthiest"" nation in the world have more children going to bed hungry than in evil communist China. What good is a virtuous political system if it doesn't take care of its poorest?

BTW, the US is not the wealthiest nation; it is the nation with the most mega/ultra rich. Country like Norway, Singapore, Japan, and Switzerland are wealthier because they have far less absolute poverty"

2020-03-20 16:37:12,It would be great if NYT included links to food banks and charitable organizations like Feeding America (that would benefit the many families I’m sure are in similar circumstances) to encourage donations at the end of the story. I’m sure many readers would be ready to help after reading this story.
2020-03-20 16:46:19,"Low income and six children.  Getting tattoos and drinking expensive soda and energy drinks.  Decisions have consequences.  I don’t feel one bit of sorrow for people that make one bad decision after another.  And please, don’t try to get additional sympathy by playing the veteran card."
2020-03-20 16:35:20,"I'm so ashamed that in a country of so much wealth, food abundance and great waste of food,that these parents are struggling to feed their children and going without food themselves. Our economy is just not working for so many like this family. We need great changes in our country so everyone has opportunity, employment and food sufficiency."
2020-03-20 17:11:53,"Instead of putting those nice flowers on the table, maybe they could sell bunches of flowers in a roadside stall. Put a sign up saying, flowers for food exchange box, or charge for the flowers and put  sign up saying the world is still a beautiful place, buy yourself or your loved one some flowers."
2020-03-20 16:35:19,"A few thoughts:
1.  Rather than serving carryout meals that require the parent / guardian to drive to school every day, the school district or county could provide families a week's supply of staple goods, fresh produce, and some prepared meals [not necessarily corn dogs and baked beans]
2.  Here is some practical guidance for healthy eating on a budget:
<a href=""https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/budget"" target=""_blank"">https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/budget</a>
To be clear, I'm not suggesting that all families have the means to purchase or prepare healthy food -- especially now, when even basics like frozen vegetables seem to be in short supply.  I'm just suggesting this site as a starting point."
2020-03-20 17:10:33,"Cue the critics blathering on about poor people having too many children -- wiithout thinking at all about how much it costs to get health insurance that enables people to see doctors who prescribe birth control. Do you think there is a Planned Parenthood in Alton, Texas -- a state that has been actively shutting down birth control centers and limiting abortion for decades? It's far more likely that the city has a mega-church or two that encourages women to stay at home and have babies. If you deny people access to universal healthcare, shut down free clinics because they provide abortions, and expect everyone to depend upon the expensive, for-profit private sector for health insurance and healthcare, this is what you're going to get."
2020-03-20 16:39:28,"Doesn't the Army take care of their own? Isn't there a social services coordinator at the local Army base who can connect this family to resources after her service?

No American should go hungry in this day and age, but a starving veteran?

 Is there a local base, church or charity with a food bank?

They need to apply online for food stamps. The family is living below poverty level."
2020-03-20 16:40:00,"25% of American children go hungry. Instead of addressing that, EVER, Republican politicians have supported more than 400 anti-choice bills in statehouses across the country, to try to prevent  women from having access to contraceptives and abortion care. They don't care about what happens to the women or the children they bear. All they want to do is force their will, usually their religion, onto women whom they don't know. They wash their hands of the responsibility. Bullying women is much more fun than solving childhood hunger."
2020-03-20 17:09:48,"Heartbreaking story, but as a disabled vet she is entitled to a monthly disability check for life and the family surely qualifies for food stamps, Medicaid and perhaps other help. Do they have a garden?  A few more facts would have clarified this situation for readers."
2020-03-20 16:31:26,"I am shocked at the cruelty of these comments.

Most Americans do not have access to stable health care, do not have the savings to live one month without an income, and have guns.

Epidemiologists predict 40-60% of us will get infected.

What do you think is going to happen?"
2020-03-20 16:43:21,"So long ago I felt sympathy for people like this. Volunteered at a food pantry, donated time and money for those who suffered the brunt of the inequality in our country. 
Make no mistake, poverty in the US exists, it is everywhere and it infinitely cruel.

Then Trump got elected. Voted into office by the same people i felt sympathy for.

I no longer feel the same way. I don't help anymore and hope that feeling this financial pain may create awareness of the crucial role of government assistance in the life of our citizens, whether it takes the form of food stamps, healthcare or Section 8.

I still vote democrat, but now I believe tough love will make these people change their minds. And if it doesn't then at least I won't be wasting my time or money in hopeless cases."
2020-03-20 16:59:42,"This is so sad. In times like this, it would be great if all bills could be put off until we get past this."
2020-03-20 17:17:39,"I do not understand why the journalist mentioned that the mother was drinking cherry Dr Pepper and Monster energy drink, while not having money for food. It makes people withdraw their compassion. I was in such situation once and managed to stretch food stamps for double time. I would not dream about drinking soda, bought everything nutritious on sale and cooked at home, never ate out."
2020-03-20 16:32:35,Don’t worry. The stimulus package for big business will trickle down to your fridge. And keep voting red. That is the closest color to beef.
2020-03-20 16:32:52,"Choices. 

The 1970s TV show ""The Walton's"" has always been on of those shows that I once enjoyed. I did until my grandmother once told me that the Walton's was a joke. A joke? What could she mean? 

""Look how clean everyone was? Look how everyone worked together and went to a nice clean church and everything had this united feel. It's so sugary sweet"" She went on with a smile. She then paused and sighed deeply. ""Listen. I raised ten children during the depression and the Walton's is as close to reality to White folks as the ""Cosby Show"" was reality to Black folks."" She laughed deeply as she patted me on the head.

What does this have to do with ""Coronavirus and Poverty: A Mother Skips Meals So Her Children Can Eat.""

My perception was that ""poor folks"" just needed to try harder. These folks made ""bad"" choices and now they are paying for their ""bad"" choices. They need to earn their place in society. If these folks would just clean themselves up. Work a little harder... maybe go to some clean church... Everything would be just fine.

I feel my grandmother's spirit is laughing at me."
2020-03-20 17:22:31,"I'm so saddened. I grew up poor in Brooklyn during the late 60's and early 70's. There was 8 of us, and the only food we ate came from the school meals; breakfast and lunch.  We had no dinner at home and no food to eat on the weekends.  After 56 years of living on this earth, not much has changed?  Families are still dependent on school lunches to feed their children. And now, with the current administration cuts to SNAP benefits, this will only get worse.  I'm at a lost for words..."
2020-03-20 17:28:13,I too only eat one meal per day. I refer to it as my weight management strategy...a.k.a. diet.
2020-03-20 17:20:57,"This is so sad.  The woman is a vet.  Her husband is working as much as he can.  Some of those kids look young enough to get WIC.  If she qualifies for WIC,  there would be cereal and milk in the fridge.  Food banks,  etc.  To think she is eating once a day is horrifying.  She deserves more.  This country is heading for another depression the way we are going."
2020-03-20 17:25:57,"We’ve suddenly found trillions of dollars to distribute to those making under $75k (at this point in the day, 3/20/20). Where was this money when it was time to safeguard people against a pandemic? I’m so outraged I need to up my meditation to hours."
2020-03-20 17:43:32,"As an over 65 senior, I've been extremely saddened to stop my volunteer work in feeding the homeless and low income.  We do see people on the news and various social media sites volunteering for various things to help others.  I've recently sent a check to the county food bank.  The same principle as always applies:  None of us can do enough, but if lots of people do a little, a lot of suffering can be alleviated."
2020-03-20 18:00:05,"Absolutely heartbreaking. We supposedly live in  the richest country in the world and there are children and adults going hungry every day.

Thanks, you are our heroes and the best of America."
2020-03-20 17:40:36,"It struck me how vets aren’t taken care of after serving our country at huge personal sacrifices.  So many fall through the cracks.  How we treat vets must change, from healthcare to pensions."
2020-03-20 17:53:47,"GROW YOUR OWN?
Looks like a fabulous big green yard for the kids. 

I don't see a big vegetable garden back there . . . 

Growing a garden doesn't cost a lot of money and can generate literally thousands of dollars in food.

Start a garden now. Radishes and small greens can be harvested very quickly. Within a month for some of them. Meanwhile all the rest of your veggies will come along. Plant more when you harvest. Keep seeding weekly. Soon you'll be sharing produce with your hurting neighbors."

This is your chance to prove your theory that pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and relying upon God is the only way for any society to function!"
2020-03-20 17:36:52,"She didn't just become financially insecure. Perhaps if she had used birth control would be in a better position now to take care of her (smaller) family. It's a mistake to give such prominence to a family who are now suffering partly because of their own bad decisions in a time like this, when so many people who have done everything they could to protect themselves and their (smaller) families are suffering as well. Sorry, I don't have any empathy for these people. Meanwhile, refugees in Idlib Province are sleeping outside in freezing nighttime temperatures."
2020-03-20 17:44:00,How does a country as wealthy as ours not have enough money to help a veteran and her family have food every day?!
2020-03-20 17:55:11,"The NY Times (as well as the rest of the media) could do a big service  by laying out how the direct payments (under the Corona trillion dollar stimulus program) are going to be administered in the coming weeks so that families like this won't be feeling more desperate than they currently are.

Will it be $1,000 per adult? $1,200?
Will there be $500 per child that was bandied around for a while?
If it is based on your 2018 tax returns, how will the money get to people that have moved since 2018 like these folks?
When can they expect the money?
Will there be new national laws suspending evictions the next 90 days?

We have millions of working poor people who are not looking at their falling stock portfolios but who are looking at emptying refrigerators. We have millions of middle class folks who going on unemployment. Millions of college kids who most likely will be returning to no summer jobs.  

Some clarity now is really important... Get on it."
2020-03-20 17:33:36,"As a teacher, I interact with children of these families every day. As a single parent, I myself have had to choose between my own medications, and those of my children. You want to hollar at them, “For the price of that monster energy drink, you could have bought a package of meat, or two bunches of bananas, a head of lettuce, and a tomato! Don’t eat potato chips, biscuits, or goldfish crackers, eat eggs! Or an apple! Cheaper, fills you up more, better nutrition.” My mind goes toward criticism of their choices: Food on styrofoam plates is costly; food on a set of dishes you wash and re-use is cheaper. Plant a veggie garden in that backyard. Put all those kids to work, helping sow, weed, water, reap. For the price of even one of all those tats, you could have fed them for a month.   But they don’t / won’t listen, bc our educational system has failed them"
2020-03-20 17:46:57,"It's disgraceful in our country that anyone should be without enough food to feed herself and her children. If she's a disabled Veteran, why isn't the military helping her and her family? And what about SNAP benefits? I just don't get it?"
2020-03-20 17:50:09,"Having just gone through the nightmare of having to apply for assistance, I can tell you that it is not easy to get through the process itself. I thank goodness that I am educated and don't suffer from any learning or physical disabilities that would make it hard to read and understand reams of paperwork. Republicans in Texas have set up the system to discourage as many people as possible from applying for any kind of aid, because they do not believe that anyone (except for big business) should get help from the government. First of all, there are barriers just to getting in touch with the system! Phone lines are jammed, websites are crashing. There are not enough people to process claims. The process of filling out the paperwork online requires access to a computer and broadband. You have to read through and fill out page after page of information, and some sites don't allow you to save and come back to it. If you're interrupted, you lose everything and have to start all over again. If you're completing unemployment paperwork online, you still have to call to talk to a person to confirm your information, and they warn you that your application isn't complete until you do. But getting through on the phone is next to impossible, because they are so understaffed (underfunded). It is obvious that the difficulties are by design, baked in to the system to discourage people from asking for help."
2020-03-20 18:02:35,"This is a by product of unbridled capitalism. Empathy and capitalism don’t go together. Capitalism has no soul and it’s all about profits and loss. 
I don’t want charity from those who can make the system work for them or who happens to be on the good side of the system. 
I would like to have a social system that preserve human dignity and so no one has to choose between medicines and food, kids vs adult meals, etc. We are not losing only meals but also dignity in life. We are losing our souls. This is so so disheartening! 
Let’s make this calamity an opportunity and work together for creating a system that preserve dignity for all and more importantly don’t forget to vote responsibly if you want to see real change."

2020-03-20 18:03:49,"Our country has food. So much food. We need to figure out a way to get it to needy families right now. Senators need to be more concerned with their constituents and  less so with their portfolios. The “president” needs to be more concerned with these children than with his re-election campaign. No child should go hungry..., no parents should go hungry. And that this mom is a disable pd military veteran?? Trump should not stuff one more burger into his maw until these folks are cared for."
2020-03-20 18:07:44,"This article points out the things that those in the US Senate evidently don't get - that people with very little need more help in times of crisis than those who are better off. The plan to send checks to American adults will help, but the structure of the plan, that those with more get more and those who were already on the hairy edge and now have no way of working get less. I have already committed to giving every penny of any government check I get to the local human services office in order to serve the needy in my community and I encourage anyone who, like me, is fortunate to have a job I can continue to do while sheltering at home and has some financial reserves - as depleted as my retirement savings are by the stock crash, I have liquid, non-retirement savings - to make a modest sacrifice by donating the government check to an organization that can see that it assists those in need in your community."

We are on the brink of a crime wave of good people who are forced to steal in order to survive. We need to be very careful right now.  We are right where Germany was when a man chose a minority to blame all of their problems on. That time we were there to help save the world.  This time it might be the world that needs to be save from us."
2020-03-20 18:11:18,"In Canada every child get a $500 monthly benefit check. Our Liberal government has increased that amount to $800 during the crisis.

Recently, I had a conversation with an older woman in our grocery store. When she was a child, she often went to bed hungry. She said her childhood left her with very weak teeth from lack of calcium. She said hunger doesn't only hurt your stomach, your whole body aches.

Be generous if you're able."

2020-03-20 18:40:07,"With 40% of the cases in NY, I think the Times should have focused on a NY family. The mom in this story can drive to a school to get food for her family & stay in her car. Many NYC parents have to travel with their kids via subways and buses to do the same; doing so involves greater risk of catching the virus. Some poor NYC residents are supposed to be in quarantine. Imagine your spouse has coronavirus. You feel fine. Your kids are hungry. Are you really going to stay at home--or are you & your kids going to go out & get to a school for food? And you are going to continue to do this each & every day? My hunch is many poor families with an infected person in the family will. Remember there are many other families with suspected cases of the virus who are not in high risk groups who haven't even been able to get a test. These families will choose food over contagion.

Once a month, my church collects for the New York Common Pantry. At least 10 other religious congregations on the Upper East Side do the same. With religious services suspended, these collections won't take place. I expect that the number of people needing these services will soar.

So, NYCers, instead of mailing off a check to one family in Texas, help the hungry in NYC.

As of today, we are providing emergency food for 15 families every half hour, but this could change with the situation on the ground. Bailouts of big industries will not help the people we serve; many are now facing a total loss of income as restaurants and other small local businesses are shuttered. Helping out starts locally: in communities across America, food banks, churches and other organisations are doing their best to step in as donations dry up.

I am skeptical about concern for ""the most vulnerable' manifested by politicians and media types who have insisted on fighting this virus at the possible expense of a prolonged global depression.

2020-03-20 20:04:46,Stories like this beg the question are the extreme steps being taken and the collateral damage that will result worse than the virus itself.  Would love an accurate analysis from some experts
2020-03-20 20:08:30,"She presumably has an army pension. He was making almost $1,000/week pre-tax. Yet they have no savings, even with their gazillions of children?"
2020-03-20 20:14:49,"The British government has just (Fri pm) guaranteed to pay 80% (Eighty) of salary - indefinitely - to all employees laid off through the Covid outbreak up to a maximum of $650/WEEK. The grant (and it's not a loan) is only available to the employed. The self-employed are eligible for an accelerated welfare package. This is on top of the UK's  $470bn fiscal stimulus injection made 48hrs ago.

Liberal, socialist Europe (and don't forget, the UK is not now an EU member) is sometimes not a bad place to be."
2020-03-20 20:17:57,"Why is this family still paying $1,000 a month rent? Forget talk about $1,000 lump sum payments to everybody at some future time. These people need a rent holiday and extended unemployment insurance now!"
2020-03-20 20:55:47,"I remember eating less so my kids could eat.

Canned soup was a big help.  It's inexpensive and reasonably healthy.  I served it almost every day with homemade biscuits or cornbread.

My parents lived through the depression and my father taught us which foods to buy on a budget that were still reasonably healthy.

My best wishes to this family and all like them."
2020-03-20 21:15:36,May God bless Ms. Mossbarger and countless others like her. She is an Army veteran. The government should be taking care of all our vets.
2020-03-20 22:15:07,"This wasn't the point of the article, and I wonder if I should have my head examined that this is what I focused on in this story, but I fixated on the pictures of the all the kids sitting around the table and playing outside in that huge yard together.  I was thinking how beautiful it is that they have each other. I realize I am removing from the picture the financial stress and hunger they are feeling.  Why aren't the parents also be included in eligibility for free meals?   After all, their health is essential to the well being of the family.  I hope prosperity finds them and wish them all the best."
2020-03-20 21:51:25,"6 kids? Seriously? We really need to have a national discussion about this. Folks, we have a pandemic, a pandemic that is partly the result of 7 billion people inhabiting a planet made for maybe 4. We no longer have acres of farm land that requires large families to manage. We need to think about what the ramifications are of having families of 3 kids or more and we need to start helping others understand this before they make this decision. Nearly every poverty peace of the NYT includes a family with far too many kids than they can afford. I hope for the best for Ms. Mossbarger and her family, but with 6 kids, even if they get out of this crisis what chance does each of those 6 children have for college, for stable employment, even to avoid poverty and starvation?"
2020-03-20 22:13:59,"If the government sends checks to everyone, it would be nice if people could opt out in favor of those with greatest need. Pool funds from people who opt out and send them in a 2nd wave to those who have greatest need. There must be a way to do this."
2020-03-20 20:52:07,"I noticed at once the yellow roses and the six children.  Also the paper plates and plastic forks
There are many ways to economize: no flowers, fewer than 3 kids, use real plates and real cutlery, instead of throwaways.

Her disability prevents her working.  Shouldn't it prevent her having 6 kids?"
2020-03-20 22:20:21,"IF there were a Planned  Parenthood with free and accessible birth control in every small town not only in Texas but every state, and IF every school had all the money and resources they needed, and IF every job paid a living wage, and IF there was free childcare and paid family leave and universal health insurance and free college, then we might be in a position to encourage people like these parents to make different choices about their lives.

As it is, once again we are blaming the victims of corporate greed, a government that serves the wealthy, and a consumer driven economy. 

I don’t blame poor people for wanting all the same things the rest of us want, and I don’t blame them for repeating the cycle of poverty that probably started before their great grandparents were born.

I blame our society in which greed is a virtue and poverty is a sin."
2020-03-20 21:53:17,"Before you go criticizing this family for their poor choices (and who are we to judge?) walk a day in their shoes. Yes, she may qualify for VA benefits but perhaps she doesn't or the VA is backlogged? Yes, they probably qualify for SNAP but they also live in Texas which is notoriously stingy with help for poor people. The six children are most likely a blend of his and hers and theirs. This story will be repeated more and more often in the coming weeks. Rather than pointing fingers and shaking our heads that their choices are wrong, we need to actually start helping these families. Children do not choose the families they are born into, and they deserve what we can give them. We are still the richest nation in the world and the fact that our children go hungry is a national disgrace."
2020-03-20 21:53:54,"Every dollar given to a food bank buys food for 10 nutritious meals.  Leverage your money, send it to food banks in rural areas, this is how you can help families across the country. 

Give and give some more, we need to change this country by doing and not just complaining."
2020-03-20 21:41:05,"An excellent FB page for eating healthy, delicious vegetarian meals on the cheap. Look to the older posts, as the author says she has been ill and won't be posting as much. $25/person/a week will be a lot for the family featured in this story, but may help others: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/poorgirleatswell"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/poorgirleatswell</a>

As to those saying the family might not be able to use the backyard for growing produce, since they are renting, when I lived in an apartment I had great success in growing tomatoes, peppers, spices etc in sunny windows in a cold climate, year round."
2020-03-20 22:29:26,"The food pantry where I volunteer has shut down because of coronavirus. I wonder what's happening with the many people we serve. Does anyone have a plan for distributing food to the needy with social distancing? If so, please post it here."
2020-03-20 22:30:22,"Happy to help the food banks, etc in this time of need, but also wonder why this couple would choose to have 6 kids. I’d never punish the kids by withholding assistance, but also wish people would be more responsible about planning their families. That’s not great decision making."
2020-03-20 22:34:13,"I think judging this woman on her drink of choice or how many children she has, misses the point.  Food insecurity and underlying poverty run deep in this country and are unnecessary in a nation with an overabundance of food.  If the woman who manages the school cafeteria is in line for free lunch, then something definitely isn't right..."
2020-03-20 22:33:45,"I grew up in a large family of 12 including one set of grandparents.   While I feel for this family, poor people in this country need to learn the basics of cooking and good nutrition. It can be done cheaply and easily.  Eggs, pasta, legumes, milk,  a bit of meat once a month and some fresh fruits and veggies made up our daily menus.  Only a bit of effort is needed to make a large pot of bean soup and mix it up with some brown rice or hard durum wheat pasta.  Another night it could be omelettes made with a couple of eggs and with some cut up frozen or fresh veggies thrown in.  It's not that difficult.  And please, everyone, stop spreading the myth that it's expensive to eat healthy.  No one should be drinking pop anymore.  I grew up in a small, southern Italian town in the 60's with no hot water, no fast food, and no junk food, no telephone, no car. Albeit it was a different environment and time, but food is food and people all over the world have been cooking for centuries and making do.  None of us starved  and none of us were overweight or obese.  A bit of public education about cooking with cheap, healthy ingredients would go a long way."
2020-03-20 21:11:21,"This is very sad and no kid should go hungry, but why do people have 6 kids? Children are expensive, let alone 6 of them. Not very many well-off families could deal with 6 kids, let alone a low-income family. Somewhere along the lines, people need to start being responsible. If you can not afford many kids, do not have many kids. Why doesn't the mother work? In this day and age, the vast majority of women are in the workforce. Only the very rich can afford to have a spouse at home.  It is devastating for the millions in the hotel, restaurant, retail sectors, etc, who are now without pay and may have lost their jobs forever, but if you can not afford 6 kids, do not have them! There are millions of women who have successful careers and they only have one or zero kids because of the expense.  Look at most of Europe and people have zero or just one kid because that is the responsible thing to do."
2020-03-20 21:40:03,I dont understand why a disabled army veteran do not receive some retirement/pension from goverment. If she served the country she deserves at least to survive without hungry.
2020-03-20 21:03:22,"I’m surprised by some of the posts. Perhaps this is not the best time to sit in judgment, if there ever is an appropriate time (judge not lest you be judged). It appears she is coming close to slowly starving herself for her children, or at least is willing to suffer greatly for them."
2020-03-20 20:55:38,"Well, it's a good thing that the corporate media and 'moderate' Democrats got Biden to be the nominee, because that evil Bernie Sanders would have strengthened the social safety net and helped these people, and we wouldn't want that!"
2020-03-20 20:49:46,I walk pass the nail and hair salons and think of the workers.  It's very tough.
2020-03-20 21:29:27,The lunches were free so why did she not eat?
2020-03-20 23:09:16,"I grew up in the Jim Crow south and I can remember sitting down for dinner with my grandfather and step grandmother, my older sister and my two teenage brothers for a dinner of Pinto Beans and a home made biscuit for dinner when my mom passed away and our grandparents took us in. 
Being 41/2 years old, somehow I dropped my plate and the glass plate fractured with my dinner all over the floor; there was no replacement.
My oldest brother set me up to the table again with his place, I ate his while he went outside and started to whistle. 
Soon after that time both my teenage brothers signed up for the Korean War; I never forgot how happy I was that he did but I was sad that he couldn’t eat.
There were no soup kitchens back then."
2020-03-20 21:55:50,"Problem 1: No one in that precarious a financial situation should be having 6 children.

Problem 2: America uses up and spits out its already poorly-paid soldiers.

Problem 3: Poverty-level wages for 44% of Americans, socialism for the rich.

Problem 4: NO SAFETY NET FOR THE CHILDREN.  Republicans sure do love forcing women to give birth to children and ignoring them once they've come into this world."
2020-03-20 23:15:34,"A lot of families have been facing dire conditions, and things are going to be worse.

Having read the article and comments, I am uncomfortable that the writer picked a family which seems to have been  touched by  every tragedy, including death, loss of work, an army related disability,  and what this does is to generate both overwhelming sympathy and an opposing  focus on the wrong stuff ( too many children, bad food choices). 

I don't know enough about this family other than to understand that they are going to struggle to feed those kids and pay rent and gas.

There are millions of families, of all sorts of combinations, and all over the country, who are going to need - at the least - a supply of food, just as families did in the Depression.  Consider - one more time - how Scandinavian countries do this differently - providing child allowances as a matter of course. 

The Federal Government - - this one under Trump which itches to take away Food stamp (SNAP) benefits, not caring about the consequences,  must now take action to assist the states and counties and cities and towns which cannot sustain such efforts on their own.  do I think they will???  Mr Trump is a president not like FDR but like Chamberlain.or perhaps Hoover..."
2020-03-20 21:37:25,Is there a way to make a financial contribution to this family?
2020-03-20 23:28:28,"As an educator and parent, I see this first hand and understand what our parents are going through. However, two objects in the story stood out to me. If she is having a hard time putting food on the table and concerned ‘about what tomorrow brings,’ how can  she afford to drink soda and an energy drink to curb her hunger? Why not buy some greens and /or fruits for the price of those drinks? Something is wrong in this picture here. Besides, with six children I cannot see how a veteran has not been given some help? Unless the media is painting a totally different picture."
2020-03-20 22:51:27,"Puh-LEEZE everyone, cut the poison known as soda/tonic/pop/soft drink. It will save you money and save your body. Not just poor people, everyone."
2020-03-20 22:39:47,"Did anyone finally post a way to help this family, if not every family in the country that we know will undergo these hardships?"
2020-03-20 22:55:38,This will expose the precariat in a way that nothing else could....
2020-03-20 23:58:43,Much of the #Coronavirus stimulus plan should be focused on helping poor & working class Americans. Instead the Trump regime is doing its best to eliminate programs that help feed working class & poor Americans.
2020-03-20 22:22:11,Can Ms. Mossbarger apply for VA disability pay?
2020-03-21 01:52:54,I have to ask how much was spent on all that ink on her arm? This family needs a financial education so they can learn the difference between wants and needs.  Sorry.  I have no empathy.
2020-03-21 01:35:31,"Does this family not qualify for SNAP benefits?  Have they no relatives to pool resources with?  Are there no food pantries they can access?  No Veterans' groups that can provide some assistance?  I feel a great deal of empathy for this family, coming from a family of six kids myself, and being raised ""poor,"" although we didn't know we were poor until we were older.  But there seems to be a chunk of this story missing. I'd like to read it."
2020-03-21 00:46:06,Why have half a dozen children if you can't feed them.
2020-03-21 02:53:29,"Forget coronavirus...it's this nation and its bankrupt morals and criminally unjust economic system that make me ill. The virus will pass, but what will be left standing? Millions upon millions of bankrupt, hungry, desperate people just like these. 

And what will the man, who was given the gift of a question this easy --""What would you tell the American people who are afraid tonight?"" --do for us? Exactly what he did to that poor, hapless reporter...explode with inchoate rage. Why? Because apparently to even ask the Bloated Sky God a question now sparks a full blown tantrum. 

I knew this man would be a disaster the moment he descended that escalator. I knew this disease would be catastrophic. I just never imagined the full horror of watching it all unfold in real time. Equal parts nauseating and terrifying. 

We are in so much peril right now that I cannot bear to fully imagine it. If we come out of this with a badly broken country it will be a miracle. At the rate things are going, nothing will be left standing."
2020-03-21 14:29:59,"I am dismayed by the number of comments blaming this stressed woman for having too many children, a kind of child-shaming, so to speak. She is caught up in forces much bigger than her, in a society where gross financial inequality is a given, where living wages are a privilege not right. The number of her vulnerable children should only strengthen our compassion, not judgment."
2020-03-21 17:22:16,"When you publish articles about personal tragedies, it feels like voyeurism.  I wish you would have a link to organizations trying to solve the problem."
2020-03-20 22:31:18,"Instead of personal interest stories like this I think every national and local paper should publish one daily story about individuals and organizations that are stepping up to help their neighbors and communities survive the Coronavirus.  We need the daily inspiration and example of the Best of Us in this time of fear,  exploitation and profiteering by some of us.

Also we need front page articles and opinion pieces about Very Important Things that can easily go under the wire during a crisis.  Richard Grenell, Trump’s latest henchman  par excellence, is continuing his Stalinesque purge of our National Counterterrorism Center, in favor of ( no doubt incompetent) Trump loyalists.  Grenell and Stephen Miller are cut from the same cloth and are dangerous figures indeed.

Netanyahu’s use of this pandemic in his bid for absolute power is also extremely disturbing and is a warning too all of us.  We need to know the details.

Didn’t know quite where to publish this comment.  So I am putting it here."
2020-03-20 20:17:10,"There is no reason to go hungry.
There is plenty of food.
Change eating habits. 
Get fresh vegetables,
eggs, cheese and milk. 
It is very easy to
roast vegetables and make salads.
Eat cheese
and milk for protein. 
This may be a good time
to practice healthy eating habits 
by being a full
or part time vegetarian

In LA I fill most of my

2020-03-21 18:30:41,"Wow, surprised that at a time when we all need to unite and lend mutual support to one another there is so much judgement and supposition about this family and their choices! It's too late for her to have a smaller family, we really don't know a lot of other details regarding other aspects of their life situation.  What i do take from this article it that there are many, many families and exponentially many more to come as a result of CV19 related loss of income who are living on the edge financially with little to no safety net.  Our focus now needs to be on how we can provide assistance and support to the most vulnerable among us."
2020-03-20 18:58:38,It breaks my heart to see these stories printed simultaneous to the exit or Bernie Sanders from the presidential race. God help this country.
2020-03-20 19:23:56,"I agree with Rick. Just when we needed Bernie's policies the most he's decreed too radical. Lofty ideas about shutting ourselves in our homes long term are great and all, but how do we pay our bills if we can't telecommute? Regular Americans aren't lucky enough to be airlines."
2020-03-20 19:27:42,"22 million children in the U.S. who need free school meals to survive. The saddest thing about the article to me was that people have being doing this for so long that they have overcome any embarrassment  in accepting the charity and are not ashamed to be seen to be accept it. That to me says that these people accept that the state / country has forgotten them and large parts of their communities. 

The Richest country in the World used to mean that the average Industrial wage was the highest in the World, Today the reality means that the 100 richest people in the U.S. are wealthier than the top 100 people in any other country. And they are ALL getting richer. And the bottom rung of the ladder have so little that it doesn't even register.

But the good news is that it can all be changed in 3 ways. 1) Vote for a candidate on the issues. 2) Debate the issues and 3) get rid of extremist right wing views i.e. Fox News"

2020-03-20 13:30:50,"This breaks my heart and there's no excuse for this situation.  When confronting a public health emergency we should never have to be concerned that some kids will go hungry because school is closed.  People should be asking themselves what happens to these kids during the summer months or school vacations?  This is a problem made more clear by this emergency, but it isn't new.  I hope more people will wake up and take this emergency as a time to imagine a future where the few aren't allowed to hoard the wealth and hurt the many.  It's way past time to tax the rich and corporations so our society can flourish instead of fester."

As anyone who has been a child or has a child knows, this is a lot of work.  Please NYT, start acknowledging the unpaid work of caregivers, and not denigrating it by saying the person is not working."
2020-03-21 18:53:06,I would hate to be disparaging of the situation in this piece- -The children have at least three different last names- are the fathers absent or are these parents taking on foster children? All the best to them for their efforts to feed them
2020-03-21 19:09:12,"There are many issues with this story but it illustrates a few things that if you don't act your act together when you are young, then you will pay for it later.  Meaning, the husband is in his late 40s and the best he's doing is a carpenter with zero fall back career?  She's in her early 30s and she's not working at all?  Not perhaps even working in a restaurant in the second shift.  There is no room for error, even pre-COVID. 

This is the life they have cemented themselves and their upward mobility will never happen.  Add in six kids that they can barely handle and it's indicative of people who didn't have a plan and their age difference will eventually catch up to them along with their poverty. 

Our country will eventually become a place where only people with money will be able to have children."
2020-03-21 21:31:27,There are so many kind-hearted and thoroughly uniformed commenters to this article.   It's sort of mind-boggling. They want to help this PARTICULAR family!  It's almost like reality TV. This family's struggles are indeed difficult - but they are TYPICAL for much of the country (certainly my county).  Readers seem to be SURPRISED here by the situation described in this article.  THIS is as terrible for our country as is the dire economic reality.  How can people vote for a leader of a country that they do not know?  We are not talking about an obscure subset of the population.  This IS the working poor of America.  Maybe a truly progressive candidate would have a better chance in the Democratic party if its members took a crash course on REAL America.  At least with Democrats there's hope that with knowledge they'll do the right thing.

At that time, I tried very hard not to be ""the"" professor but rather the moderator in a group of people seeking to learn. Some of my students ached for me to be more of an authority. Some of them had never asked a question that was answered by the instructor with: ""I frankly don't know. Let's find out."" 
Now we have one of those times. All of us are learning how to live with an invisible enemy. It is essential that we put our heads (maybe, digitally) together and find out what community means and what Rousseau meant with the term ""social contract""."
2020-03-19 16:54:48,"Yes, "" the urgency of the coronavirus crisis might force generations to find a common economic cause"".

When this pandemic recedes and there are effective treatments and a vaccine...
Maybe, our American society will have learned the difference between want and NEED.
Maybe we will begin to have a more human centered healthcare system, medicare for all.
Maybe the American economy will change in ways that
make the economy more ethical, and realizing that the economy's purpose is to serve the society, and not expecting society to serve the economy with the humans   seen only as consumers to be manipulated into buying more and more, always and forever.
I'm not sure the American economy could change.
It would take leadership.
I remember that, a few years ago, Bernie Sanders was invited to give a speech at the Vatican on ""The Moral Economy"", a concept he has not talked much about lately.
To the Establishment, the idea of a moral economy is unAmerican. 
The pandemic could be a turning point.
For the future of America, the World and our small planet, I hope for a more moral economy."

Why are we still letting congress members buy and sell their own stocks? They're insiders and equivalent to company officers with unprecedented access to know things in advance and affect the outcomes."
2020-03-20 13:58:05,It’s my understanding that Congressmen and Senators are exempted from the insider trading laws. If this is true then that law should be changed as soon as possible. If the members of Congress refuse to address this issue then it should be made public at every opportunity especially if they are running for reelection. I don’t expect any to resign because if they had enough integrity to resign they wouldn’t be trading on inside information in the first place.
2020-03-20 13:20:44,"This isn't surprising at all. No one on Wall St. was prosecuted for the crimes committed resulting in the 2008 financial meltdown. Senators and Reps. have been bought and sold by lobbyists and campaign finance contributors. The Supreme Court green-lighted the final nail in the corporate takeover of politicians in the Citizens United decision. Trump has simply put a huge exclamation point on the greed, use of govt. for enrichment, and the ethos that ""get whatever you can while the getting is good."" And nothing will happen to any of them. Lobbyists are swarming with outstretched hands for the trillions Congress is appropriating to somehow alleviate the effects of this pandemic. Meanwhile, the swamp is overflowing, the credit markets have seized up, and the real ""tide"" has rolled out revealing the how hollow our financial system has become."
2020-03-20 13:39:40,Doesn't this qualify as insider trading? Hundreds of thousands of dollars? They sent Martha Stewart to federal prison for much less. Let's hope the same standard applies to Burr and his colleagues who did the same.
2020-03-20 13:29:36,"""Congress began requiring its members to disclose their stock sales in 2012, when it passed a law called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, which was intended to prevent lawmakers from using inside information to profit.""

As far as the stock sales, I don't begrudge anyone using their intuition to protect their investments.  There was enough public information available about CoVid-19 that anyone paying attention could have used that to base their positions on.  That is very different than say, shorting the market which was forcibly curtailed last week."

2020-03-20 13:46:57,"It seems disingenuous to report that three senators made stock trades, and then not mention for many paragraphs later that those trades were made through a blind trust. 

I used to work for an investment management firm in the IT department.  We had so many restrictions on what, when and how we could buy or sell that it made very little sense to own individual securities.  I ended up using a financial planner to manage most of my money. While transactions still needed to be reported to my company after the fact, my advisor was not required to “pre-clear” since she did not have access to any of my company’s non-public information. 

Something like this needs to be in place for our elected representatives, their staffs, and their spouses. Otherwise they’re really just cheating."

If Senators sold stock based on classified briefings, that is criminal.  However, the much larger story is that some in our government knew the danger of COVID-19 and did not act."

Those who make money investing in stocks do so because they sell before everyone else.

This appears to be all that Mr. Burr did.  And this is no defense of Republicans, all of whom that are up for election this November will hopefully be voted out of office.

But the entire thread of this article appears to be about denigrating Burr simply because he had the good sense to get out of the market in time to save his earnings and then waited until his holdings sold before announcing his concern about the potential for an epidemic.

2020-03-20 13:53:23,Any public official with knowledge of the pandemic found to have traded a disproportionate amount of stock prior to the crash should be forced to resign and charged with insider trading. And should be forever defined by this act of malfeasance.

Loeffler's office makes a weaker claim, because it doesn't use the words ""Blind Trust"", but, if true, again, no foul.

But it certainly looks like both Inhofe and Burr were both selling ahead of the market on insider information.  When even Tucker Carlson, who's to the right of most of the GOP Senate calls for Burr's resignation, he's toast.

It seemed like Burr was one of the last Republicans in Congress with any sense of propriety, sharing the Intelligence Committee control with Mark Warner, the ranking member.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I am, and disappointed.   

Inhofe doesn't surprise me.  After all, he's one of the 8 who voted against the coronavirus relief bill, arguing that people need to work to get aid, even if their sick, that getting relief will make them ""lazy""."

I am so incredibly enraged. As an American citizen, whatever my personal political party preference, I trusted that in times of real need, such as a natural disaster or emergency, my government would be there. We feel abandoned and betrayed by Burr and Trump — who might have prevented the severity of this, who could have taken decisive action like Singapore where their citizens remain free to move about, work, and hug their elderly loved ones.

What makes this particularly egregious, however, is that so many Republicans were on TV and other media sites expressing an “all is well” attitude at best and “this is just a hoax” at worst while they clearly understood the potential ramifications of what was heading our way. That is unconscionable."
2020-03-20 14:09:47,"The SEC and the Justice Dept., headed by William Burr, must now open an investigation into whether these politicians committed a crime. To do less will only enforce the wide-held belief in this country that the system is indeed rigged against them."

I couldn’t find any particular news about failed studies of their T-cell based therapeutics for cancer that the Senator might have had advanced notice of and it’s not like it’s an airline or hotel stock. 
But...even if she is not on a committee that regulates the pharmaceutical industry, it’s hard to imagine that she, like all members of Congress, doesn’t hear things from colleagues before we do. Acknowledging a lack of context, this big sale should prompt suspicion regardless of an impending pandemic and I’m glad that someone is keeping an eye on these things. 
And as a Democrat, I can’t indict President Trump for not being blind to the interests of Trump International and give Sen. Feinstein a pass despite saying that her husband makes totally independent decisions about their personal finances.  It may be true but it’s hard to believe."
2020-03-20 14:30:38,The real crime here is that Burr sold his stocks while he and Trump were saying it was a good time to find bargains in the market and that all was being handled well with coronavirus.  The reality was that by Feb. they had both had confidential classified briefings that this was not the case with the virus and that the economy was likely to have serious shortfalls.  If they believed what they were saying publicly they would have been buying stocks.  They obviously were not. Money talks.  What a system we have in place.
2020-03-20 14:30:42,"His position as the chairman of the senate’s intelligence committee afforded him information that the average American investors didn’t have.  Richard Burr apparently committed the crime of insider trading.  His trading activities needed to be investigated and if found guilty, he must be punished to the fullest possible of the law."
2020-03-20 13:50:57,"It is very important to determine whether these trades were made at the direction of the Senators. If the trades were made by the trustee of a blind trust, then no wrongdoing has occurred. If the Senators themselves directed the sell-offs, then they are likely guilty of an offshoot of insider trading known as the misappropriation theory.

Traditional insider trading involves a corporate insider, such as an officer or director of the company, making trades on material, non-public information. Misappropriation theory, however, involves trading on material, non-public information by someone other than a corporate insider, who owes a fiduciary duty to the company. These Senators were not corporate insiders, but they do arguably hold a fiduciary duty to these companies (and the public) by virtue of their public offices. This is precisely why we require legislators to disclose their trades.

If those Senators directed the trades based on non-public information about COVID-19, then the should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And if they were trying to profit from stock trades while they knew that we were about to experience an horrific health crisis that would result in a multitude of deaths, then they are unfit for public office and cannot be shamed enough."
2020-03-20 14:15:55,"I am almost certain that what prompted the senators to sell their stocks, after a briefing from National Security people, was not related to COVID-19. At that time, no one knew if it would reach US shores and, if it did, there was no indication that it could be as devastating to the US economy as it has been.  

A much more plausible explanation is that they got information on Saudi Arabia's intention to increase its oil production, which has caused oil prices to drop by 50%. Many believe that action has contributed to the stock markets downward movements as much as COVID-19. We saw a similar stock market dive in the summer of 2014, when Saudis increased their productions, again causing a 50% drop in oil prices.

The fact that Saudi Arabia was able to crank up its oil production so quickly indicates that this was planned.  Thus, the outcome of Saudi-Russian ""negotiations"" must have been decided in advance."
2020-03-20 14:07:10,"It's so easy to deny things when you're not under oath. All four should be investigated and forced to testify under oath. Party affiliation is irrelevant.

2020-03-20 14:26:17,"Based on this, many are calling for Richard Burr to resign his seat in the Senate (assuming that his behavior has no innocent explanation). This call comes from people at both ends of the political spectrum, ranging from AOC to Tucker Carlson. While it is heartening to see Americans come together like this, there's one caveat to consider. Burr is one of the only Republicans to acknowledge Russian interference in the 2016 election. If he resigns, his replacement would be a different Republican. (NC is one of the only states where the governor is required to appoint someone from the same party as the incumbent.) As in many southern states, Trump enjoys strong support from NC's Republicans. If Russian interference is looking like a threat for the 2020 election, then this may not be the right time for Burr to resign."
2020-03-20 14:14:20,"As a North Carolina citizen and voter this is beyond disappointing. Burr not only utilized a national security position on the Intel Committee for his personal financial benefit, but even downplayed COVID-19's dangers to the public afterward. 

Whether the act is ""technically"" illegal is another matter. The fact is our elected official leveraged sensitive information in a corrupt manner and then neglected to reflect the truth publicly. Doing so erodes public trust and needlessly endangers the lives of the people Burr is meant to protect. 

I have called Burr's office and encourage others to do the same. I doubt he will resign, therefore it is our responsibly as an electorate to ensure he does not remain in his seat. Anyone who safeguards their personal wealth over the protection of public health does not deserve to be in our Congress."
2020-03-20 14:37:11,"Aren’t there federal laws about using inside info to trade in the market? Any one, Senator, congresspersons or  just anyone on the street should NOT benefit from prior knowledge.
If a member of Congress, he or she should be investigated, sanctioned if found guilty and jailed."
2020-03-20 14:08:02,"The problem here is were the senators preaching one thing and doing another. Period. That’s it.

We all knew how bad this thing could get but didn’t try to manipulate the market with our words."
2020-03-20 14:15:50,"I assume our national legislators have always been opportunistic, but I strongly suspect that insider trading based has become ""business as usual"" during Trump's term of office as he's jerked the market around repeatedly with his trade wars."
2020-03-20 14:28:51,"While we all knew of the Coronavirus and its damage in China by mid-February, and many of us recognized that the market was way overbought at that time, I find Burr's op-ed assuring everybody that the US was prepared for a pandemic at that time very suspicious. This warrants investigation, as it does for the others, including Feinstein.

Had I not been in Mexico on vacation and not paying attention to the market, I might have taken a sizable cash position around February 19. At the first bounce on March 2, I did so and will live on that for a while (I could have waited until March 4 to somewhat more advantage).

Given the privileged information given to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senators should put their holdings in blind trusts. This should be law, the violation of which would entail substantial criminal penalties and removal from office for commission of a felony."
2020-03-20 14:10:28,How is the Chairman of the NY Stock Exchange even allowed to OWN stocks?   Isn't this a patent conflict of interest?
2020-03-20 14:26:49,"This seems like a non-story to me. Earlier, when the virus was confined to China, I also considered repositioning my assets. I've done some reading, in the past, on the topic of pandemic preparedness. I'm not an expert, but it has been clear for years that the US has been woefully unprepared. In the end I decided to weather whatever came, and that is what I'm doing now. I'm content with that choice.

Burr made a different decision. Why is that wrong? It's not like there was any mystery that the virus could cause large problems, both socially and economically. It may be the case that he told Fox viewers the US was ""better prepared than ever."" That might even be true. But ""better than ever"" doesn't mean we are well prepared. It doesn't seem like he ever made that claim (I might have missed that).

I think anyone who has done any studying on this subject is not surprised by what is happening now. Current events are totally consistent with various scenarios I've read about. It is frustrating to those of us who have studied this that the US has done so little to get ready. However, I don't think we should punished for our foresight by those who were not paying attention."
2020-03-20 13:20:25,I suspect that our political system is so corrupt that it's only natural the this is the quality of politicians that are drawn to seek elective office.

This is Chris Collins all over again, except in the process of covering up their actions, Burr and Loeffler put lives at risk by failing to ring the alarm bells until well after their transactions had cleared..."

OK...given that...then they have the audacity to tell us peons that they had contemplated sales for many weeks, or their financial advisors did it and they had nothing to do with it.  Do they expect that their constituents are that ignorant that their rationales will be accepted?  ALSO, does anyone wonder if certain high government officials in the executive office (WH) may have done the same?"

One bought Roku-think they might have realized everyone was going to be at home? One did buy Delta-probably realizes they are going to get a major bailout-& maybe a sly attempt to argue their other decisions were not virus related. 

Only remedy is probably going to be at the ballot box as I assume only Senate rules, and not SEC laws, were violated.  As to the idea that they were only using good common sense (actually, if they are telling the truth, it would be their financial advisors making independent decisions) wonder how many others were buying and selling as they did at the time-when few were that concerned about the virus?"
2020-03-20 14:08:30,"Why the outrage?   ""Insider Trading""?  Not hardly.  There was no ""insider"" Corporate information being disclosed.

The thing people should be outraged about, is not someone showing good sense and selling before an anticipated fall in value, but that the Trump Administration, along with it's cohorts at FOX, were downplaying the threat and, it seems, actively muzzling the CDC and other agencies attempting to sound the alarm."
2020-03-20 14:45:53,Would be shocking to learn the president followed the same path as the Honorable Senator Burr. We have a right to know if the President was actually sophisticated enough to play it the same sinister way the senator did.

2020-03-20 14:11:26,"The Trump Virus is exposing a number of failures in our political system not just the greed and immoral behavior of members of congress and the administration.
The Trump Virus has shown the total inadequacies of our health system, the dangers of shifting manufacturing to the cheapest country, the the expulsion of scientists from government and the cruel mendacity of pronouncements from the Trump administration faithfully printed by the mass media.
Unfortunately the Trump Virus will be with us for a long while yet and will lead to many more deaths owing to inadequate and expensive health care."

2020-03-20 14:52:30,"Senator Burr needs to resign immediately and then he needs to be prosecuted for insider trading. We need to cease allowing one set of laws for those who are wealthy and politically connected and another set of laws for those who are not. We have allowed white collar crime to remain virtually unpunished in this country while sending poor people to jail for being too poor to pay a parking ticket, thus guaranteeing that the poor person loses a job and becomes even poorer. When we allow wealthy senators to thumb their noses at the law, we just accept that they are above the law. That said, I have no faith whatsoever that Burr will do the right thing and resign, nor do I have any faith that AG Barr would do the right thing and prosecute him. So there you have it. The wealthy can escape punishment, the poor cannot. Says a lot about the current condition of our country."

Forbidding insider trading by our federal lawmakers, and a whole host of other ethical and campaign finance restrictions to prevent the corruption of our government, are supported by everyone except Republican senators who have been blocking these laws for a generation.  It is completely legal for a Senator to trade on insider information right now, stealing from the rest of us.  That will not change until we stop electing Republicans."

2020-03-20 14:40:44,"Just like Senator Burr and the Congresspeople cited in this article, investors everywhere have sold stocks. That's why the market is down.

When Senator Burr sold his, the COVID-19 virus was peaking in China, moving to other parts of the world, and it was clear that the virus threatened to bring  world economy activity to a halt. It was no secret. Headlines everywhere warned of trouble ahead.

What was Burr to do, assuming that anyone would have listened at the time? Advise everyone to get out of the markets before the downturn, hastening it? Would he have been more noble to do nothing and ride the markets down? Or is the real problem that he owns stock at all? 

This story is now circulating widely on social media, stoking an irrational mob mentality that  populist politicians across the world now exploit to everyone's detriment.

Yes, extreme wealth disparity is a problem. Undue influence of the rich and powerful robs ordinary people of political representation. It foments political political and social instability. It empowers demagogues. It makes the world a more dangerous place. 

Railing at ""Millionaires and billionaires"" and  ""Wall Street"" misses the mark . Wall Street is not a entity in itself.  It is an aggregate of investors, large and small, institutional and individual. The are what drives the market up or down. They are the ones who get ""bailed out"".
If we want to fix it, focus on changing the laws instead of convenient villains. Get even instead of mad."

2020-03-20 14:46:43,It wouldn't take a genius to conclude that the travel industry would take a hit when we were made aware of corona virus. Everyone was aware of that so can't fault him for making stock trades... its a free country.  But in his position as senator and making positive comments about pandemic preparedness the optics aren't great.  As a senator he shouldn't be surprised there would be heat.

Leave it to a Democrat to sell biotech right before a pandemic!

Gallows humor, folks. I'm a Democrat, too. Looks like Feinstein's sale was not nefarious (not to mention her assets are in a blind trust). Not sure that I can say the same for Sen. Burr and his fellow Republicans..."

I cannot think of a single thing either one has done for the citizens of this state.  Neither Senator has ever bothered to answer any of my e-mails over the years whether critical of them or not.  Now Burr had ample knowledge of the looming pandemic and covered his own behind.  All of our investments tanked his did not.  Shame!!!

If Burr cannot adequately explain his actions, along with Senator Loeffler and any other Senators, then our diminishing faith in who’s draining the swamp and who is guilty of more “swampiness” is justified."

In mid February Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) gave a speech on the Senate floor in which he explained his understanding that COVID-19 was a serious and immediate threat to the health of the American people and the US economy. He then held a press conference in which he repeated his understanding and answered press questions.

Burr was attacked via Twitter by President Trump and the attacks elevated the news value of Burrs speech and press conference. The press interviewed other information sources (CDC, other members of Senate committees, ...) who confirmed Burr's concerns. 

Imaginary result: As COVID19 began to take root in the US,  Burr became a hero for having sounded an early warning.

Actual result. Burr preserved some personal wealth and left American citizens unprepared for pandemic and the economy is crashing.  Burr is now known to be a coward and a traitor to the US. The debate is now over whether his failure of courage constitutes treason."

At the time, he said that insider trading was already illegal, so he so no need for redundant legislation.  

The Republican Party as a whole is corrupt.  They will do anything to hold onto power.  They use their power to advantage large corporations and the ultra rich.  They will throw bones to other to keep their grip on power.  Republican congress people then trade on their legislative power for personal enrichment.

And if you could look at Joe Biden’s and Trump’s stock market behavior in Feb. & March, I’m sure you’d see the same thing. Of course that information is a state secret."

2020-03-20 14:07:44,"So Burr knew and understood what was coming, sold his stock, informed some colleagues but still supported Trump's delusions for those critical weeks.

As Trump and his followers as so fond of saying... Lock him up!"
2020-03-20 15:08:42,"Diane Feinstein made tens of millions of dollars as an ‘early investor’ in Facebook, and I don’t remember ever seeing any scandal about that. Let’s not forget that the Democrats are every bit as corrupt as the Republicans."
2020-03-20 15:06:51,This is not surprising and expected.  The obscenely wealthy made a fortune during the last economic downturn.  In the 1960s members of the CIA made fortunes on farm commodities because they had access to satellite data that the general public did not.   Rules were eventually passed baring this.  Burr does not think these rules apply to him.  He is an obscenity.
2020-03-20 13:48:15,"Want to not look duplicitous, Mr. Burr?  How about addressing the stock sales.

Anyone willing to look could see that they're all con artists, grifters, frauds, led by the biggest, most successful swindler in American history.  Anyone who didn't realize that Donald Trump was manipulating markets for his own benefit is hopelessly naive.  He was doing that before he took office.  Why would he stop?  He certainly didn't stop running his real estate empire.  He simply shifted to a taxpayer subsidized model.  Let's grow up a little. This is the guy who bankrupted Atlantic City.  And you thought he was on your side?  Did you graduate from Trump University with a Ph.D or something?"
2020-03-20 15:03:57,"Burr is guilty, without a doubt, of Insider Trading. That much is obvious. But if one can tie even one person who dies from the virus to the intentional *misinformation* Burr has spread -- that's negligent homicide."
2020-03-20 15:06:29,"“Insider trading?”   There was public information that few heeded.  An inept unresponsive government, a sickness with contagious people showing no symptoms, a potentially deadly virus that spreads easily.  This was all public information and some of us didn’t pay attention. The real crime was Burr and many others telling us there was no problem."
2020-03-20 14:52:30,"Trump said we would get tired of all the winning!  He just meant watching all the elite winning.

2020-03-20 13:55:47,"Burr ought to be behind bars for reckless endangerment. It would appear that three weeks ago he had the lowdown on what was coming. Did he share it with his consituents? Did he issue a public statement? Guess what. No, he shared it in secret with a group of bigshot funders. He shrank from going against his President publicly. He told no one outside of that cozy group of well-heeled business elites. He's also guilty of insider trading. Rumor has it Burr will retire when his current term ends in 2022. Not soon enough to be done with him. He'd look great in prison orange. It's the new color of the GOP."
2020-03-20 15:00:26,"How is it that the actions of Senator Burr are not considered a variation of ""inside trading"" with the exception that he had ""inside knowledge""?

Every last one of these elected officials should be brought up on charges for these unethical and illegal acts."
2020-03-20 13:25:23,So far three Republicans have been caught dumping stock while assuring the nation the economy is strong. After three and a half years of cow-towing to the worst president in modern history a narrative is forming as to why they are in office.

2020-03-20 15:04:35,"If this isn't corruption or at least the very real appearance of corruption, then I don't know what is.

2020-03-20 15:03:24,"Conflicts of interest are based on appearance of impropriety. As bad as it may look, this is not insider trading because his decision to sell was not about a particularly stock, but about managing his portfolio with the information he had. The only way to avoid this is for everyone in public office to require trusts to manage their portfolios. Part of his job is to have early access to information. He cannot “unknow”this. If in his judgment, things were going to worsen, there is no legal reason he couldn’t act on it. Otherwise, his hands would be unreasonably tied."
2020-03-20 14:50:07,"I'm sorry, but potential virus impact by February was widely known by everyone but the President by February - it was no means a prescient trade - maybe if they did it in November then it would be suspect.  By the end of Feb, the stock market's unsustainable rise was just looking for a reason for a selloff.  I think many professional traders acted on this very pubic information."
2020-03-20 14:56:31,"Get ready for more false equivalences: Sure, Burr is guilty, but so is Feinstein. Not really. If people take the time to examine the details, it is clear that what Burr appears to have done (on his own behalf) is very different from what Feinstein (or more accurately her financial advisers) did."
2020-03-20 15:08:24,"So Burr knew the impending virus was going to be devastating to our country, but wrote an opinion article downplaying the threat... And Trump didn't acknowledge the impending threat, actually going to great lengths to even deny its existence until well after the WHO declared it a global pandemic - then stated he knew all along that it was going to become a pandemic? I truly don't know which act is worse - however I do know that both of these apparent 'leaders' do not have our country's best interest at heart - and both have absolutely no business representing our country."
2020-03-20 14:45:47,"Kelly Loeffler, the newly appointed Senator from Georgia (and apparent insider trader), has been running a barrage of TV campaign ads. She paints herself as a businesswoman and an outsider. Regarding Washington, she says in her ad, ""It's even worse that you think.""

On that point, I would have to agree with her.
November 3 cannot come soon enough."
2020-03-20 14:47:36,"What a spectacle! Senators cashing in while the emcee in chief peddles his parsimonious 1200 checks as if they represented some grand magnanimous move on his part. And yet the majority of us persist in putting our hopes for rescue from the absurd dysfunction of electoral college Donny in the ""moderate"" mediocrity of Joe Biden."
2020-03-20 14:57:58,"Perhaps someone will explain how the actions of these elected officials differs from the action Martha Stewart took several years ago, which resulted in her trial, conviction, and being sentenced to prison. 

Insider knowledge is insider knowledge."
2020-03-20 15:07:36,"When the full story comes out that explains USA's delay in testing for the virus I suspect we will find that certain high placed Republicans including the President and his family were seeking to profit from the virus testing regime.  They envisioned great profits and did not take effective preventative action to protect Americans when the opportunity still existed. They were supposed to act as the trustees of America's citizens. Instead they placed their pecuniary interests at the forefront and refused the test kits offered by W.H.O. so that they could own the testing kit franchise in America.  That miserable calculation put all Americans at risk of contracting the disease, to this day we still have difficulty identifying who is infected and thus we cannot identify the individuals they have exposed. So the virus continues to spread. The corruption of the Republican Party has led us into this colossal disaster. It threatens to  potentially cost us millions of lives and trillions of dollars of debt to fix if that is even possible at this point.  Senator Burr and his fellow Republicans knew the seriousness of t he threat as did many of Trump's advisers.  Yet they did not stop Trump from ushering in the Trump Virus. They did take action to protect their personal financial interests however. Senator Burr and all his colleagues who stood by and attempted to profit from the impending disaster should resign."
2020-03-20 14:41:51,"Sorry People but this is inside trading and if true, he is in deep legal trouble. Taxes paid his salary and for the briefing that he used for personal gains. Inside trading and not a real leader and certainly not someone who represented anyone but himself and his family."
2020-03-20 15:08:50,"The answer to all these problems is that legislators and presidents should be forced to sell all their and spouses' holdings except for a primary residency.  Don't like that policy?  Don't run then.   Maybe that will cause a self-selection to more normal people running, and not just the wealthy and landed class."
2020-03-20 15:12:19,"This is far worse than anything that any hedge fund operator ever pulled.   Far worse than insider trading.   Using words that will cost lives, not Syrian lives, not African lives, not lives we'll all forget about in a few weeks.  No, these will be the lives of our Fathers, Mothers, Sisters, and Brothers and on and on all for the sake of massive profits built off the accounting tricks, stock buybacks, and modern day political speak to drive the markets higher in relation to earnings than they should ever be.  Even going so far as to claim the word ""Investment"" around the word stock when the proper term should have always been ""speculation.""
All of Washington DC wreaks.  It wreaks of business, religious, political, and the last three years of personal corruption the likes of which most have never seen.
November can't come soon enough for the entire crew."
2020-03-20 15:13:23,"On the same page as the story of a mother who's skipping meals so her children can eat, we find Richard Burr's first instinct is to protect himself and his fortune. Burr also had the audacity to warn his biggest donors about the seriousness of the coming pandemic weeks before the general public was informed.  Obviously they knew what was coming.  They just didn't want us to know what was coming.  A perfectly reasonable decision excepting the fact that thousands of Americans will die because they made it."
2020-03-20 13:16:47,"Before the election, there must be a full accounting of all investment transactions by all members of congress and other high-ranking officials in all branches of the federal government. It’s a small matter of character, ethics, integrity and yes, even possible criminality. Of course, what should exist, is a law requiring all of these public servants to place all traded investments in a blind trust."
2020-03-20 15:11:32,No surprise. He is must another one of the greedy and dishonest grifters who comprise the current Trump administration. If he isn’t prosecuted for insider trading his constituents should vote him out.
2020-03-20 15:14:14,"You know, some analyst say it may be legal what Republican Richard Burr did but I think it stinks to high heaven.

Here's a person with, what amounts to, 'inside information' who suddenly dumps a lot of stock while at the same time publicly saying the United States was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus.  To me it's JUST TOO COINCIDENTAL.

And it also looks like ""At least three other senators sold major stock holdings around the same time"", 

How can anybody have faith in these people who seem to have quite a lot of coincidental good luck?"
2020-03-20 15:17:54,"Instead of Burr warning the  masses he warned a few,  I don't remember seeing him on FOX bravely contradicting Hannity about the, ""hoax,""  that so many of Burr's constituents believe this virus to be.  What he did was not only unseemly, it was wrong.  And, what make matters worse?   While millions lose millions in 401ks and other financial products, this jerk sells his off based on insider information that he refused to share with the masses.  I wonder if he told Trump."
2020-03-20 13:22:07,"""He argued that the report made him look duplicitous for sharing information at a publicly advertised event that was consistent with the message members of the Trump administration were then trying to promulgate.""

2020-03-20 15:12:18,"I understand that fed electeds are allowed to cheat on the stock market, which is repulsive, but that they would cheat on the market while lying to the public about the conditions motivating their trading is criminal.  I can't think of anything more reprehensible than manipulating the public to prop up the fake market they are trading out of."
2020-03-20 15:14:43,"Feinstein's transactions were done by a blind trust, selling off holdings in a biotech stock.

Burr's transactions were done with affected industry (hotels), and executed while he publicly supported President Trump's downplaying of the COVID19 outbreak.  

There is no equivalence between the two."
2020-03-20 15:15:44,"This is all insider trading, if not what is. When does the investigation start? States must take up insider trading, the feds will do nothing and if convicted these people will be pardoned."
2020-03-20 15:16:49,"As a Senator with confidential briefings, did his use of that information, while publicly stating the opposite, constitute insider information?  Did he violate SEC laws and regulations?"
2020-03-20 15:18:03,This story appears with the story talking about the mother skipping food for her kids.  So many individuals will be suffering over this period of time.  Not a great commentary on showing leadership by Mr. Burr and others profiting from inside knowledge.
2020-03-20 15:13:36,"Lying to the public, while lining their own pockets? Sounds like every Republican ""public servant"" since Ronald Reagan."
2020-03-20 15:18:36,"Even without the stock sale, selling news that rightly belongs to the public to the highest bidder is a gross violation of our trust. As a resident of not only NC, but Winston-Salem in particular, I am deeply embarrassed by Burr's behavior. These are difficult times and it is sad that we have such small-minded men in leadership."
2020-03-20 15:12:34,"Senator Burr has always felt that members of congress should never be held accountable for insider trading. As for Dianne Feinstein, she was the mayor of San Francisco when I lived there during the 1980s and I never had any trust in her. The four Senators who traded stocks should suffer the same fate as the congressman in upstate New York who was charged with insider trading."
2020-03-20 15:13:45,"Senator Burr, nothing if not a good Christian, was certainly thinking about the parable of the talents found in Matthew 25:14-30. What else could he have done, except for telling the rest of us , and that might have spoiled the whole thing?"
2020-03-20 15:14:37,You can be sure that these same elected officials will be looking out for the wealthy as they design the economic support to get through this crisis.
2020-03-20 15:16:11,We should pass a law prohibiting members of Congress from buying and selling stock while they are in office. Seems a worthwhile trade off for the privilege of serving and might discourage the self-serving candidates from running for office in the first place.
2020-03-20 15:15:53,"Both Senator Feinstein and Representative Pelosi made their fortunes from insider trading before the requirement to disclose transactions.  Why are you picking in Senator Burr?  Do you imagine for a moment that the others are not communicating with the trustees in those ""blind"" trusts?
Those with ""blind"" trusts most certainly communicate with the trustees and then trust the trustees to make the desired decisions.  The trustees are trustees because the owner of the trust trusts them."
2020-03-20 15:16:06,"Republicans are not in the public service sector to serve the public, they're in it to serve themselves. And it's been that way for five decades."
2020-03-20 15:16:20,"Good luck prosecuting these guys for profiting off inside information. 

They took advantage of non-public macro economic information. The current laws relate more so to using information particular to a business(es). 

Their proper comeuppance should come from voters."
2020-03-20 15:13:35,Reprehensible. Violating the public trust. Lawmakers placing themselves above the law.
2020-03-20 13:37:41,"Selling hotel stock after a highly sensitive intelligence briefing at which the full implications of the Covid-19 virus pandemic was no doubt discussed is a clear violation of public trust. Senators, and particularly those who sit on special committees, have privileged access to information of national interest, which is why one of the Senate's basic rules of ethics is that ""A Member, officer, or employee may not use his or her official position for personal gain."" 

This is not a victimless crime. Senator Burr dumped stock on the basis on information gained from his priviledged Senate briefing. The people who bought his stock did not have access to the same information Senator Burr had. If you bought Burr's stock, or if your pension/mutual/retirement fund bought his stock, you are a victim. 

And people wonder why Bernie Sanders' message resonates with Americans. They are tired of being played."
2020-03-20 15:20:48,"""It is apparently not the first time Mr. Burr has acted decisively to shield his assets from financial turmoil after hearing from government officials.""

Senator Burr is the Intelligence Committee chairman, he is a member of the Senate health committee and Dianne Feinstein is also a member of the Intelligence Committee.

The fact that these two individuals in addition to others who profited from selling stock BEFORE the president declared a national emergency clearly demonstrated not only a conflict of interest on their part, but clearly unethical and illegal behavior as well.

These are the kinds of actions which need a thorough investigation about.  I hope the states of North Carolina, California, Oklahoma and Georgia remember this in November.  The actions of these Senators are beyond disgusting.  They are wrong and are illegal.  

Truly the epitome of abuse of power."
2020-03-20 15:23:43,No pollition should be able to own stocks or ETF's or trade the markets. Treasuries and US Savings Bonds is about it. They all get insider info and to think that anyone isn't above profiting on it is ridiculous.  This country finds it too hard to punish insiders.
2020-03-20 15:24:41,Oh how I wish we had transparency into what trades the Trump family has indulged in recent weeks/months.
2020-03-20 14:12:06,"It's one thing to have your assets in a blind trust, where you relinquish control to a 3rd party; it's something else entirely when you sit on the Intelligence Committee and are privy to information that tells you to dump and run, and then you do. Burr's aides claiming that he had decided to sell the stock long before the health crisis emerged sounds like the same-old, same-old kind of excuse that insiders have used for years... I had no idea any of this was going to happen... it was all just a happy coincidence.

Burr has only one choice here: Donate 100% of his profits --- he can keep his original investment --- to various food bank and relief agencies in North Carolina. Anything other than this and he should be investigated, prosecuted and/or resign from Congress. This kind of profiteering in the face of so much pain and need is beyond despicable."
2020-03-20 13:14:55,These Senators should be imprisoned without PPE.

2020-03-20 14:25:52,"Burr, Feinstein, Inhofe and Loeffler all need to be prosecuted for insider trading and put in jail.

But will that ever happen?

Of course not...because there are two sets of laws in this country. 

One set for you and me...and a completely different set for those in power.

And the NYTimes should be exposing this as the front-page headline...not buried on Page 19 of the print edition."

2020-03-20 13:32:02,Talk about doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. In these trying times people need someone to take out their wrath on and Burr just became the poster boy for the swamp.If it is true he will be vilified for being a person who took advantage of a crisis.

As bad as it looks, there's really no indication he did anything illegal. As an investor I should have known. I look back at January and it was pretty obvious that the smart move would have been to get out then, or move to bonds and cash. I waited too long, but managed to save about 15% of my portfolio that I would have lost if I hadn't have sold it."

2020-03-20 13:22:48,"The vandals are stealing the handles. Here is an update on the Senate insider trading- which ordinary citizens go to jail for 15 years. 
""Republican (appointed) Sen. Kelly Loeffler, whose husband is chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, began selling off more than a million dollars in stocks on the same day as the closed-door Senate meeting on Friday, Jan. 24...Over the next three weeks, through Feb. 14, Loeffler made 27 sales worth between $1,275,000 and $3,100,000, before the market nosedived and the values of her holdings tanked...She also purchased stocks on Feb. 14 from two work-from-home-related companies — Citrix, which specializes in teleworking software, and another tech firm, Oracle, according to the report (<a href=""https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/georgia-senator-dumped-stocks-after-private-meeting-on-coronavirus-report"" target=""_blank"">https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/georgia-senator-dumped-stocks-after-private-meeting-on-coronavirus-report</a>/)."
2020-03-20 14:00:27,"Of course this is sickening news, but it also explains why a Senator would spend millions upon millions of dollars for a seat that only pays $174,000. This is disgraceful even for shameless politicians."
2020-03-20 16:04:58,"Our elected national leaders are too far removed from the lives of the average Americans. They live in a bubble where they are isolated from the worries of income inequities, access to health care, and job security. They are quick to protect their own assets at all costs while dragging their feet on action that would benefit the greater good--and the average American. Burr's actions are reprehensible. Given all that he knew, he could have pushed harder for greater pandemic preparation and pushed back on the narrative that the pandemic was overblown. We know his priorities now. What will it take to find elected officials who truly understand the meaning of public service and have empathy beyond their narrow social group."
2020-03-20 16:11:43,"My 28-year-old son, a product manager for software, sold all his stock before the downturn. The information was publicly available for anyone to analyze. I haven’t seen anything that indicates Sen. Burr had knowledge of any facts that weren’t known publicly. How those facts are interpreted by different analysts - including government analysts - is irrelevant for insider trading purposes. Now if anyone here can show that the senator was given secret information about some material facts, that would be a different case."
2020-03-20 15:39:38,"Burr felt it was necessary to sell his stock holdings after being briefed on the seriousness of the corona virus. The fact that he did this knowing it might be considered illegal tells you how concerned he was. BUT he did not think it was necessary to sound the alarm to the public? What is his excuse, he is not going to run again. He could have come forth in the interest of the public. Instead he provided cover for Trump and stuck with the party line that everything was going to be great. A classic example of republican party over country mentality. No patriotism here, just self-interest."
2020-03-20 15:28:08,"Isn't this the definition of insider trading?  My company does not allow me to sell stock outside of prescribed windows of time regardless of market conditions to avoid any chance of an insider conflict.  And Loeffler is married to the CEO of the NYSE.  

More than resignation, this should be jail time for everyone who went to a private briefing that provided information that would clearly impact the markets and then took action to protect their personal fortunes.  Martha Stewart did jail time based on a single equity.

And the senators are elected officials who serve the people.  Strip their lifetime medical coverage and their jobs - and join the rest of us who deal with uncertainty most of the time."
2020-03-20 15:51:05,"There were laws put into place during the early 2000's to stop all congress people from trading on insider information. There were Dems as well as Repubs who engaged in this disgusting behavior. As for Burr, Tucker Carlson has called for his resignation. People here and on twitter have been surprised by T. Carlson's call.  The fact is Tucker Carlson has been so far out in front of this crisis, he has been almost a soothsayer.  When the rest of FOX was laughing or minimizing this virus (even as late as almost two weeks ago) Carlson, on his show, stated that this crisis might be the most serious event this country has faced in our lifetime, if not longer. And he said that politicians had better get do something and fast before the whole system was overwhelmed. Anyway, Burr, Feinstein, and Loeffler, at minimum need to donate the proceeds of their trades, to hospitals throughout the country."
2020-03-20 16:01:39,"Obviously, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Or does anyone really believe only Feinstein, Burr, Inhofe and Loeffler are using their position as lawmakers to enrich themselves."

Please, Republicans, support him with everything you have!"

Failing to take such actions following the last crisis was one of the biggest mistakes made by the Obama administration.  Obama might have been viewed more kindly by some of the folks who spent eight years belly-aching about his Presidency."
2020-03-20 16:13:42,"If the SEC wants faith in the markets to return, then Burr should face an immediate investigation into insider trading - as Occams's Razor would suggest it was. 

This should be true even if Burr were to donate some or all of his proceeds from the sale. 

The degree of self-dealing and corruption in this Administration is staggering, and the Trump cult members seem not to care.  They should wake up and realize it is the value of U.S. government and financial institutions that are being undermined - and they will not be able to escape the results."
2020-03-20 16:14:07,"Donating his profits to provide protection gear for 
health care providers is about the only way out for burr it
would seem...

It would also be very interesting to learn what he and alexander

they chose to parrot trump's lines rather than speak
truth to the country. 

Somehow it hardly seems surprising that people who
chose to not hear any impeachment testimony would feel 
it would be perfectly proper to sell 
carefully identified stock holdings based upon their
private information. 

If you are capable of swallowing the  pathetic argumentation 
that if trump felt there were  some  grounds for believing
Burysma corruption was a problem before initiating 
the shakedown of its prime president then that justified
the entire  effort,  then you are equally capable of
rationalizing to yourself that selling high in early February
is perfectly acceptable.

2020-03-20 16:00:35,"This is much ado about nothing.  The stocks sales in general, and Senator Burr's comments at the Tar Heel Club in particular were made well after there was enough open source material available to know that the Covid-19 virus was unusually virulent, and going to be a serious problem.  This publication started running their live updates on the current corona virus outbreak in mid-January, and the President imposed the travel ban on those coming from China at the beginning of February.  As February progressed, anyone paying attention didn't need to sit in a Senate Intelligence Committee briefing to know that."
2020-03-20 15:32:05,"Why is anyone surprised? The Republican Party that fought for fiscal restraint, balanced budgets, honor and integrity are long, long gone. This ain't your father's Republicans anymore

With the Grifter in Chief leading the pack, most of the folks who presently make up the Republican party are pretty united in just one thing: putting profit and personal gain above ....everything else, including American health care.  They have no trouble lying, covering up, evading responsibility.

And to line the pockets of their pals and boost their own stock portfolios, they've created heart stopping Federal deficits, even before the present crises. And be sure, there will lots of government largess directed at corporate cronies and wealthy patrons under the current ""relief"" package.

Expecting them to practice ethical behavior is like expecting an alligator to give you a ride across the swamp."
2020-03-20 15:40:11,"If Donald Trump is a ""wartime president"" then these politicians are wartime profiteers, and should be punished accordingly. But how many others are there in Congress and the Administration who similarly received early warning but chose to put personal profit first?"
2020-03-20 15:44:24,"Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) should resign his position immediately. He took advantage of confidential information as a United States Senator that was not available to the American public (that’s called ‘insider trading’). Senator Burr sold ‘ahead’ of the market with this information and made upwards of $1.5 million dollars. This is disgraceful and I call upon him to resign or, in the alternative, have the full Senate remove him from office."
2020-03-20 15:57:04,"Isn’t this an SEC Rule 10(b)5 violation?

The rule prohibits trading based on possession of material non-public information. 

Just like the hedge fund guys who were fined and sent to prison- right?

Do senators have an exemption from this rule?

Maybe everyone should have had this information at the same time and then they could act as the want knowing there had been full disclosure. Isn’t that what Rule FD is about?

And an HONEST person wouldn’t have have acted in that manner. And a senator is supposed to represent his constituents. But like lots of republicans (and others) burr looked out for himself first with complete disregard for his oath of office and all Americans. 

If he had any honor, he would resign today."
2020-03-20 16:03:51,"Should Senator Burr be prosecuted and forced to resign? Yes, but not for selling stocks. He should be punished for telling the American people this lie: 
    Mr. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, wrote an opinion article for Fox News suggesting that the United States was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus.

Senator Feinstein sold Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., which immediately went up by 20%. What are we accusing her of again?

I'm no market genius, but on Feb 5, I wrote: 
""I fear that the market will do more than the Trump bumps and bottoms of 1000 points on the DOW.

I truly fear that there will be a terrifying pandemic. It might be this new Coronavirus, or it might be the next one. Neither China nor the US is taking preemptive measures to protect us, and I fear that a virus like this could dwarf the over 40 million who have died of AIDS, both in size and in speed.""

The more Trump and friends dismissed the dangers, the more certain I became in my judgement. When my wife returned via Bangkok and Seoul, where the TSA folks wore gloves and masks, to enter the chaos at JFK, with no masks or gloves, and each passenger entering their own data, bare-handed, onto a touchscreen, no means of cleaning afterwards...well, I was certain that we were in desperate trouble, in great part self-inflicted. This isn't just ""sad"". It's tragic."
2020-03-20 15:44:22,"If Burr does not resign, there must be some enforceable regulation in Congress which provides for his removal, and profits realized should be donated to deserving charities.

Way past time for our elected representatives to be held responsible for their actions.

This gentleman, and I use the term reluctantly, is a self-serving self-dealing opportunist, with nary a concern for any human other than himself.

No wonder trust in government is the lowest its ever been."

Nothing else besides accumulating wealth and power seems to phase them and this article tells us how even a global,pandemic, threatening all of humanity, is an opportunity to profit.

2020-03-20 15:27:36,"CIA and other intelligence agencies have analysts who don't just report facts on the ground around the world. In a non partisan way they also lay out the potential consequences for our leaders in their regular briefings. 

If Senator Burr thought the consequences were so dire, he and his Democratic counterpart should immediately have held a public press conference. Others should have made similar public statements before acting to protect their stock portfolios. Most Americans were left to watch the daily Trump misinformation circus as events spun out of control."

2020-03-20 16:05:18,"At least someone else was listening to Warren Buffet too, who said that the stock market was due for a big drop. January and early February was a good time to sell and also buy puts. Trump took quick action to eliminate travel from Asian countries just a week after the virus was determined to not be a type of flu. Of course, many Democrats , including the Governor of Washington State, Biden, and Schumer, all said that Trump was overreacting and the restrictions and cautions were not needed. Some people believed Trump and took action and some people believed Biden and Schumer."
2020-03-20 15:26:55,"I don't know why people are getting upset. Everyone in this country is equal. It is just that some of us are more equal than others.

2020-03-20 15:34:23,"I would not be surprised if this was more widespread. I certainly can see Trump playing down the COVID virus and its potential effects on the economy so he, his family, and Billionaire buddies could pull their money out of the market before it tanked."
2020-03-20 15:48:05,"With this preliminary (and perhaps limited) info, it appears that:

- Burr personally made the decision to dump his stock.  If this is true, he's guilty.

- Sen Feinstein claims that her stocks were in a blind trust, and/or that her husband made the decisions to sell the stock.  I'm not knowledgeable enough to understand the rules of a blind trust; perhaps that does honestly protect her from culpability?  On the other hand, the my-husband-did-it excuse sounds phony, and perhaps it's illegal?

- Loeffler's statement about third-party control of individual investments in her portfolio could possibly be true.  I have two different retirement accounts in different brokerage firms; one asks me before making sales, but the other is a managed account, which I've given permission to to make adjustments in the portfolio as they see fit.  So, it strikes me as possible that Loeffler's telling the truth.  But it does sound too coincidental, and perhaps suspicious, that her husband is the President of the NYSE.

- If Inhofe's story is true, then it seems to me that he's not culable.

But the big question is:  How can we ever know the truth behind these stories and the given excuses?  If Martha Stewart got thrown in jail for similar things, then surely we must be able to ascertain whether these four are just as guilty."
2020-03-20 15:48:36,"""Of course, what should exist, is a law requiring all of these public servants to place all traded investments in a blind trust.""         Since Trump came in,  Republicans don't seem to be bothered too much by laws."
2020-03-20 16:02:26,"If, as Burr claims, the timing was coincidental, I'd like to know when was the last time he sold off so much stock in such a brief period of time.

I'm betting it's probably never before.

But we won't have to worry about all these if Biden becomes president. After all after he got a sweetheart mortgage from a bank in Delaware he claimed he didn't know he was receiving a special deal because he had no idea what the rate the average person was receiving."
2020-03-20 16:03:41,"GOP at it's best.

Cheat, lie, deflect and make it others problem.. 

Every administration since Nixon and after; they have only looted America and never help real Americans. They have spoke lies to hide their original agenda.

I haven't found one GOP leader, who has been working at least 10% of their time to help America or Americans.
They're here to make our government weak enough so they can do what ever they like.

MoscowMitch has put in judges, who are not only ideological against majority of Americans but also the ones - who will can be bought with money and so rich will have free reign to do what they want.
We need a new senate and rules.. starting with all Trump decisions to be reversed with step 0 - court appointments."
2020-03-20 15:25:19,"Newsweek report never even mentioned Diane Feinstein. You state: “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.” Does not mean she wasn't aware or her husband talked with her about it. And the same with Senator Loeffler's weak explanation. If it wasn't so unimportant conflicts of interest, here why is it only coming out 1-2 months later. They must have known the financial windfalls came from somewhere in the mail or online notifications, as it made the federal disclosure reports. 

When shot like this happens and occurs in politics, why do we always separate it between Republicans/Democrats as the guilty parties, but not with our party of choice. 2007/08 was the same, it was the housing bubble, not the Bankers/Wall St., Hedgefunders ect. Like Trump, blame someone else or deny it was known. Then just apologize for 'my ' bad judgement(s) when it becomes public, and then all is well again in our capitalist society as the perennially accepted way of doing business in America, and we'll all move on to the next occurrence of the 'unknown publicly' 
accepted frauds.

And then there are those for whom power insures their wealth.  This is the very meaning of corruption at depths that destroy democracy and make a joke out of the notion of public trust.  Burr should be removed from office; but North Carolina has already fixed for itself a political system that insures the protection of wealth and power and rewards the corrupt."
2020-03-20 15:53:34,"Sen. Burr’s decisions, like those of his colleagues and other insiders, were rational but hardly ethical. 

When government becomes, in elected or bureaucratic office, just another way to get or stay rich, it loses legitimacy. When leaders set a standard of “me first”, who do we follow?

We can return to a national culture where there is some shame for this behavior, but it will take some work."

So he has even better gov'y information than I do (I read public papers) and he knew our national pandemic prep was bad. If he was publicly downplaying it along with Trump, impeach him."
2020-03-20 15:45:01,"When our government withholds information, spins it, ignores it and deliberately contradicts it, we citizens suffer.  This insider trading is a perfect example.  Most financial advisors urged people to resist the temptation to sell their stocks, sticking with the traditionally sound ""you're in it for the long haul, just sit tight"" assurance.  And under ordinary circumstances--especially if one expects to have decades more in which to work and ride out market fluctuations--this is sound advice.  But these are not ordinary circumstances, as members of congress learned earlier than they let on to the rest of us.   

From the moment Humpty-Trumpty brazenly insisted that his inaugural crowds were record-setting, it was clear that we could not trust anything he or his minions said.  His own back is the only one he's ever had.  And don't think he didn't instruct his kids exactly what to do with the family's holdings before he ever began to acknowledge in press conferences that Covid 19 was anything more than the flu.  

If nothing else, this proves beyond a doubt that congress, the white house and every other government entity must be tightly regulated and policed by someone other than themselves.  The temptation to feather their own nest and shield themselves from the burdens they impose on the rest of us is just too great."
2020-03-20 15:59:01,"Burr says he will not seek reelection in 2022, so he is feathering his nest in preparation for retirement. 

 It is time to reduce the six year term for senators. They are free to do what they wish for their first years until a few years before their next election. By then, with today's speedy news cycle, the public will have forgotten those first few years and they are home free."
2020-03-20 16:02:05,"Maybe they could, including Senator Feinstein, donate their profits to worthy causes. My local hospital here in the very rural part of SW Washington State is pleading for donations of hospital beds to care for the patients afflicted with COVID-19."
2020-03-20 16:04:34,"Senator Diane Feinstein also sold stocks and securities, as did others - both democrats and republicans. Does anyone believe that our government officials really care more about the people they represent than about themselves?"
2020-03-20 15:28:50,"$1.5 million is not a fortune. Sure, the optics are outrageous but fact is that thousands of people involved in the financial markets who are paying attention sold stocks well before Burr. For those who know how to look and see, the approaching debacle was obvious so they rushed into gold...and were decimated."
2020-03-20 15:45:05,"Perhaps we need to vote ALL of them out.  ALL.  It will take 6 years, but do it.  Then, we need term limits.  Very SHORT term limits."

2020-03-20 16:02:22,"Surely these senators knew that their stock trades would be public (eventually). I think they went ahead and did it anyway because they KNOW they will NEVER be held accountable. Their constituents will still vote for them (oh...but those Supreme Court appointments), their colleagues will be ""concerned"" or ""deeply concerned"" but do nothing, and entire establishment will rally to protect their own. 
That, to me, is one of the most depressing aspects of this episode."
2020-03-20 15:56:56,"My husband and I are watching the  retirement savings that we live on disappear to nothing, as the stock market falls.  We did not have the benefit of insider briefings, and so we followed the  of sit common wisdom of sit tight in a downturn and the market will rebound; advice that was promoted in  NYT columns within the past few weeks.   And if the Trump administration had told us the truth about this virus and the US lack of preparedness, we certainly would have been better prepared in all ways, including financial.  Now we face the fact that everything that we worked for is gone and unlikely to return in our lifetime."
2020-03-20 16:24:12,"It was not just Burr that did this, also Feinstein. As much as I dislike the GOP, both sides of the aisle did this. I think anyone that has money invested knew this was going to happen, even without being told it was going to happen. The stock market has been volatile for the last several weeks. What goes up, must come down at some point. I don’t like the fact that they did this, but we have other things to worry about right now. This is an issue we need to remember in November when we cast our votes."

Today a Republican Senator gets caught in such a shameless act - Trump will probably get him a medal and there will be vindicating silence from the GOP.
2020-03-20 16:12:44,"Beyond shameless. I hope the regulators investigate and charge them with insider trading. And the Trump family? With occupancies down and restaurants closed, we can only hope that the Trump Organization defaults on the loans with Deutsche Bank, their lender of last resort.  and that Deutsche Bank has the courage the let the defaults occur. 
With the ski areas closed in Colorado, at least we were spared Jared and Ivanka frolicking around on the slopes."

This goes far beyond the ""appearance of impropriety"".

For all those calling for Burr's and Loeffler's resignation put down the pipe. All they have to do is scream the typical dog whistles (abortion, deep state, affirmative action, socialism etc) and the same base losing their retirement and jobs will vote these clowns right back into office."

They should also have no conversations during normal work that are not recorded for possible ethics review and guaranteed eventual release into public historical record. This should probably hold true for any registered lobbyists as well. The opportunity for abuse at our expense is too huge, and too many of them are taking advantage of it."
2020-03-20 15:27:46,"Why are members of congress, privy to not-yet-public information that affects the stock market, allowed to profit from that information?  Any of the rest of us would be fined or jailed or both.

What's worse is that before Burr's sell-off (sell-out?) he downplayed the economic impacts of the virus, mouthing in line with the demands of the trump crime family and the republican party of liars.  After he sold, he began to suggest the US needed to be better prepared.  Deception of this type is unfortunately now the norm in Congress.  Who is the enemy of Americans now?"

These people are the swamp and they are representative of a bigger problem.  It is politicians like Feinstein and Burr and the army of lobbyists who see this behaviour as characteristic of the kind of politician they should be looking to influence that are the issue. ""Out of 44 members of Congress who either retired or lost their seats in the midterms and went to work in the private sector, 26 — or nearly two-thirds — went on to get jobs at lobbying firms, a recent report from Public Citizen found."" A self perpetuating bunch of grifters if ever there was.  To display such behaviour at this time of crisis is not only amoral but borderline criminal."
2020-03-20 15:28:31,"There are three problems with Burr’s stock sale. One, it’s illegal. This is a classic case of insider trading. Two is it’s unethical. Such a sneaky, selfish thing for a public servant to do. Three is it’s cowardly. A real leader would put his constituents ahead of his own interests. Burr needs to be removed from office."
2020-03-20 15:52:14,"If he did it - many of them did it. 

We know that Loeffler, Feinstein and others from the committee also sold stock. You don't think they told their friends, families? What about other committees who received briefings? 

They are telling us everything's peachy while our ""leaders"" have been preparing for the apocalypse. 

This is truly traitorous behavior. They need to pay."

What else would you expect when you put people who have nothing but contempt for government in charge of the government ?

Trump ought to just say it out loud: ""Ronald Reagan liked to say, 'The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.' On behalf of the Republican Party, we are here to show just how right he was by not lifting a finger to help anyone (other than the corps and the 1%, but you knew that)."""
2020-03-20 16:46:20,"These four must resign and now. Burr sold his stock on the same day that he publicly repeated on Fox the Trump lie that the virus was no big deal. In other venues he has said precisely the opposite. What in the world was Feinstein thinking? Burr, Feinstein, Inhofe and Loeffler should all resign now. It is extraordinarily unethical for these folks who have inside knowledge, who are presently legislating our response to the virus, to profit from this crisis or appear to be doing so. Americans are being laid off. They are losing their incomes and their benefits. They are watching their savings and their IRAs drop by massive chunks every single day. They are being asked to shutter their small businesses, at risk of having them go bankrupt."

2020-03-20 16:30:45,"MEDICAL WORKERS May be working around the clock to minimize the destructive impact of the COVID-19 on the US. Meanwhile, several members of the Senate have busied themselves with sales of stocks that they believed would lose value when their values fell dramatically.  That is a prime example of giving the appearance of engaging in unethical behavior.  I think that if the Senators involved chose to be transparent and to show that the transactions were made by a partner or spouse or some other authorized person, rather than taking them away from the business of We The People, then their behavior would seem more acceptable.  Contrast, however, the response of the GOPpers to self-serving behavior among their own, with their unrelenting attacks on Joe and Hunter Biden!  While Hunter's business affiliations in Ukraine may give the appearance of bieng unethical, in fact, there has been no evidence that he broke any laws.  Joe Biden explained that he had warned his son.  But could not interfere because his son is an adult.  These Senators who enriched themselves by taking time away from their duties to We The People, while others lost money, betrayed the trust of their constituents.  Thanks to the shoddy behavior of those Senators, they lacked the moral rectitude to remove Trump from office.  The should know this:  For every person who becomes gravely ill and dies from COVID-19, those Senators have blood on their hands!  (Disclaimer:  Figure of speech. No harm of Senators intended.)"

2020-03-20 16:01:14,"What's the problem it is capitalism. During the Civil War and Vietnam War the rich little kiddies paid their way out of military service. During every war the insiders and others made hundreds of millions off war profitering. The NYT had an article on the B-29 fire bombings of Japan at the end of World War II. The first test flight of a B-29 from Seattle the aircraft had major engine trouble, but made it back. The second bomber test flight was not so lucky it could not make it back and slammed into a building in downtown Seattle killing 25. Turns out the Wright engines were being passed through even if there was a problem. Miller wrote a play about it All My Sons and it was turned into a movie. Boeing and its dead machine the Max and the government regulators that saw no problem and who was sitting on the board of Boeing Nikki Hailey you know the former UN ambassador that said Trump never lied and is angling to become VP. Not shocking it is business as usual and anyone who still believes that the rich, powerful, connected insiders see the patriotism in a different light is more than alittle naive."

How to accomplish this is the problem. A project for some thinktanks."

2020-03-20 16:27:35,"I've just never understood this mindset. Unfortunately, our economic system rewards selfishness and greed. It's not just this action--it's thousands of actions every day in which those who are willing to exploit others end up with the most stuff while others literally suffer (because, we can infer, they're just not 'good' enough). 

We're proud of our system? That one single child in this country goes hungry would be enough for me to denounce it. But the evidence of the rottenness is everywhere."

2020-03-20 15:25:03,"The story of Senator Burr et al is the most infuriating story of greed to come out of America’s response to the virus. These politicians should resign. I hope the Times will bring this story back around. Most crisis have heroes and villains, I am ashamed to have villains in the room shepherding our response to COVID 19, and corrupting the economy. The definition of “greed is good”."
2020-03-20 15:33:43,"Oh please. You think this is the first time a senator has done this? Burr isn't the first politician to use his position to enrich himself. Trump has done it for 3 years and there's hardly been a  peep. Just because Burr and others did it during a time of crisis shouldn't be what everyone is so outraged about. The outrage should come the first time some senator or president refuses to divest himself from investments, or when the president shows favoritism to foreign governments of countries in which he has properties. If let them get away with it in normal times, we can hardly complain about it in times of crisis. Congress is full of shysters. Almost all members are richer at the end of their terms in office than they were at the beginning. That's not news. Deals are done every day that favor senators, or representatives, or the president, or his family. It's disingenuous to act outraged about it now."
2020-03-20 16:36:44,"This is a very small but universally known reason , yet another, why I don't trust any politicians who all act above the law in the Capitol Echo Chamber.

2020-03-20 16:42:44,Burr’s problem is duplicity. Saying one thing to the public while doing the opposite. This is unethical but I don’t see how it is illegal. The administration was downplaying it at the time. Irresponsibly so.

Today it hovers at around $20."

Thousands of his fellow North Carolinians are not so fortunate, as they have lost their jobs or their small businesses are heading for bankruptcy as a result of the sudden collapse of the economy.

Members of Trump’s cult of personality, such as Trump Party Senator Richard M. Burr, are now so brainwashed and so far-gone from democracy that they provide rationales for bad behavior that involve Their Leader. 

For example, Burr “argued that the report made him look duplicitous for sharing information at a publicly advertised event that was consistent with the message members of the Trump administration were then trying to promulgate.”

Burr is being criticized for unethical behavior and what would otherwise land him in prison if he were not a Trump Party congressman, so his basic instinct to defend himself is to say that he was only repeating the Trump Party position. His unthinking impulse is to quickly assert that he can’t be punished for what he and everyone knows is unethical and should be a crime, as long as it is “consistent with the message members of the Trump administration were then trying to promulgate.”

Third Reich thinking, Burr baby. But remember that there are still millions of us patriots don’t belong your cult."

If it is illegal to yell fire in a crowded movie theater, it should be illegal to publicly proclaim an imminent pandemic is nothing to worry about. This is aiding and abetting mass murder.  Burr can't claim he didn't know the truth; he can't claim it was just a difference of opinion. He knowingly and willfully endangered the public. There is a strong chance Burr's lies resulted in death or illness. 

We need to expose and stop the #PandemicProfiteers, including the small-time scammers and the big-time pols. This is fraud - plain and simple. For a quick profit, he sold out his constituents and fellow citizens.

“There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history,” Mr. Burr said, according to a recording obtained by NPR, which reported on his remarks on Thursday. “It’s probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.”"

Who did that, if it was dine, would be a tale.

Right now, buy going on a sell jag big holders will scare out the weak of heart, and be able to buy back in at bottom and as market soars (all sellers gone, buyers demand driving price up) be even richer than before

On March 16, 2020
Trump admitted to the reality of the real presence of COVID-19 without acknowledgment or mea culpas for having promoted it as a 'liberal hoax', a flu, etc. 

Trump knew, Senators knew, yet did nothing to protect the health of our citizens. For 2 months or more, they knew and did nothing. 

Further, the senate acquitted this dangerous and irresponsible president on Wed. Feb 5th when they could have convicted him and begun, by providing leadership and planning, to protect the U.S. against this virus. Pharisees all!

I have family members at work this week in a hospital where they have run out of self-protective N95 masks because of these incompetent and selfish elected officials. No leader Trump who vowed to deconstruct governmental institutions and services while enriching himself. GOP are good with that."

Burr now unmasked is really asking Trump and the senate to forgive him (sounds like a quid pro quo),instead of voluntarily giving his illegally obtained gains to food shelves, and accepting responsibility for his actions.  Burr's behavior is disgraceful and inexcusable, and this government, most especially at this time, should in no way condone it - Burr should be fined and expelled."

People who defend these rights by trading on inside information and getting away with it are admired and envied in the investment community, although this admiration is usually not publicly expressed, and their investment products command high prices.

It is high time for limitations on the free market (socialism, big government, government regulations, bureaucrats) to be praised and for the market itself to be an object of suspicion and surveillance as well as a producer of our current (lopsided) prosperity.  The lopsidedness of our prosperity is how the market works when left to its own devices, and this working ends up the way it did in contemporary Russia."

2020-03-20 17:45:56,"Didn't Representative Chris Collins go to jail for 26 months over the same actions?

At the least, there needs to be a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into this.  If evidence of (or equivalent to) insider trading is revealed, they should all resign.

I hope besides the usual investigations there is one into how he violated his oath of office.

I think many would have a problem with that characterization.  

I hope that the relevant authorities are keeping track of the trading activity of the president's family and associates.  A recent example is the sharp rise in Mylan after the president mentioned that hydroxychloroquine (which Mylan makes) might be a ""game changer"".  I, for one, sure would like to know who bought the stock prior to the price hike."
2020-03-20 17:32:09,"One wonders how these Senators amassed such wealth to trade on in the first place given their meager public servant salaries versus the private sector.

This a wake up call for term limits. 

Career politicians build up their wealth with insider trading over many decades and for some reason the majority of the cases don’t get prosecuted, as if it’s a perk of the job."
2020-03-20 17:54:42,"The enormous stock sales by various well-placed senators right before the recent decline smells like market timing.  And hard as it may be to believe, market timing does not work.  Senators who spoke out of both sides of their mouths at the beginning of the pandemic while dumping seemingly vulnerable holdings will not benefit in the long run.  They will surely miss any upturn as they sit on the sidelines.  One reason market timing does not benefit investors is that most market gains are made on a small number of days.  Sit out for those days and you lose."
2020-03-20 18:35:11,"Every elected official at the federal level that has influence over the value of a stock, bond or other financial instrument, must as a condition of assuming office, place all holdings into a blind trust, with oversight directly by an independent watchdog group.  President, VP, members of Congress and Supreme Court Justices, all need to understand that profiting off information available only to those in power or off those that can make a decision to affect a company or industry positively or negatively, is insider trading.  It is illegal and immoral.  

Perhaps that is why so many are so good at it?"

2020-03-20 17:51:54,"the insiders work for themselves first?  I'm shocked, shocked.  We can easily guess who will get the ventilators and hospital beds when they become in short supply.  And no doubt the big boys will get the bailouts and the rest peanuts (as in the 2017 tax ""reform."")
But we elect them into positions of power so collectively we get what we asked for, disgusting as it is."
2020-03-20 17:58:46,"Mea culpa: Earlier I posted a comment saying these four must resign. That was wrong and I apologize. Burr sold his stock on the same day that he publicly repeated on Fox the Trump lie that the virus was no big deal. In other venues Burr said precisely the opposite. Burr attended confidential meetings with our top CDC scientists. Burr's wrongdoing is the very worst of the wrongdoing here. A public servant privately profiting from this tragedy is unethical and very likely also criminal. On the other hand, as reported elsewhere here today by David Leonhardt, Feinstein and Johnson (not mentioned in this article) have done nothing wrong. For example, Feinstein's investments are held in trust, as they should be, and she had nothing to do with the sale. Under any conventionally ethical administration, Inhofe and Loeffler would resign, as their assets are not properly in trusts. It is extraordinarily unethical for these folks who have inside knowledge, who are presently legislating our response to the virus, to profit from this crisis or appear to be doing so. Americans are being laid off. They are losing their incomes and their benefits. They are watching their savings and IRAs drop by frightening quantities every single day. They are being asked to shutter their small businesses, at risk of having them go bankrupt."

In fact, I’ve made small and regular purchases and I will continue in do so as I did in 2008 and 2009. Optics are everything and highly elected officials should know better, even if a third party manages their money.

Kids are told from a young age to look out for themselves and grab as much of the pie as they can. 

Times like these present extremely lucrative opportunities, mostly for already wealthy people, to enrich themselves while the rest has to suffer...

All you can hope for is that the people in power and the people with the funds at hand to profit from this crisis, have an ounce of decency left in their bodies, an ounce of honor and an ounce of respect for the law.

The very nature of capitalism though, is that the people who make it to the top are usually not the ones who are compassionate, decent or law-abiding, because they would not have gotten there in the first place if they were.

So good luck to us all, and lets hope greed will not lead to something way worse than the corona virus in the coming months when the people with money can dictate the course of the country and the whole world, because lots and lots of businesses will be hurting for liquidity and the ones providing it will get to write the rules.

How can it be insider trading when anyone with the ability to read a newspaper or listen to a news report (not Fox) would know what was happening world wide and thus would also happen in the United States? In February Sen. Burr and anyone else with two brain cells could know that the virus would hit the travel industry and many other industries, and hit them hard. It is hardly the Senator's fault that a belief in and an understanding of science is anathema to his fellow Republicans. And science may have economic consequences. But this is not a secret."

This was nothing but a blatant attempt to mislead the other investors.  Burr knew ,from the simulated 'Crimson Contagion' from January to August of last year, the US was inadequately prepared to deal with a pandemic!  

Instead of attempting to mitigate the medical supplies and hospital shortages this report highlighted, he chose to profit from the misery of the electorate.

This demands an immediate, independent and apolitical investigation with the teeth to charge and prosecute those involved.  Public trust has been completely destroyed by this unethical, malignant and corrupt administration!"
2020-03-20 17:20:16,"This kind of behavior, whether legal or not, is exactly what is wrong with our government. We have grown far too tolerant of corruption and self-dealing, far too willing to accept that there is no value in ""public"" service and that our elected officials should be able to grow wealthy from it. 

Any self-respecting U.S. attorney general would immediately launch a criminal investigation of Senator Burr and any of his colleagues, regardless of party, who engaged in similar self-dealing. AG Barr won't, of course, because he works for a President whose corruption is utterly rampant.

And people wonder why so many Americans have lost faith in our government."
2020-03-20 17:21:41,"While, perhaps, what Burr, and apparently other senators did, is technically not ""insider trading"", as defined by securities laws,   although maybe it is, at the least it is a morally corrupt act because millions of Americans who should have had the same information as Burr had when he sold his investments have suffered major economic losses.  This morally corrupt act is compounded by the opinion piece that Burr and Alexander, the senior senator from Tennessee wrote for Fox News (aka ""Trump TV"", or as George Will referred to that particular media outlet several years ago, ""Fox Pollution"") when they said, around the same time that Burr gave his ""insider"" comments to the Tar Heel Society, in which they said that, to paraphrase, basically, when it comes to the Coronavirus, ""everything is under control"".  

I used to like Burr, as members of the Trump GOP go these days.  I used to think he tried to be a voice of moderation in a Moscow Mitch-run Republican controlled senate, but not anymore.  Burr is as phony as they come.  He's nothing but yet another Trump Sycophant."

The sell-off of stocks by Senators Burr, Feinstein, Inhofe, and Loeffler based on privileged information they received in their capacity as public servants is disgraceful. Anyone caught doing this in the public sector would be fired, fined, arrested. How is it that someone like Loeffler, whose husband literally owns the NYSE, can get away with this? What, she's not rich enough already?

That this is happening at a time when this country is in the throes of a pandemic is tone deaf and repulsively selfish; it also violates ethical norms and insider trading statutes.

People fail to understand this  basic tenet: Many Republicans enter politics precisely so that they may profit from situations like this, and they do so routinely. Usually they manage to 'fly under the radar', only failing in this instance to realize the magnitude of the developing crisis and the attention it would garner. These are people with no instilled work ethic. They are nurtured and educated to seek out an easy buck and no opportunity is disqualified simply because of questionable legality. Most of the time they are canny enough to pull these things off."
2020-03-20 22:34:37,"If these reports are true, everyone of these Senators should resign or be recalled.  This is profiteering from the coronavirus health crisis, plain and simple.  They all had inside information and it looks like they used it to enrich themselves.  The White House has set the tone and from all appearance these Senators are just following the example set by Trump by using their office to enrich themselves.  

The Democrats in the Senate need to investigate Diane Feinstein to see if she used insider information when selling her stock.  If she did then she needs to resign or be recalled otherwise she will become a drag on the party come November. 

At the very least there needs to be an ethics investigation launched using an impartial counsel to look into this matter.  Failing that the press needs to stay on this story so the voting public can run every last one of these people out of office."
2020-03-20 22:34:04,"Maybe now the American public can fully understand that the right-wing capitalist policies implemented over the past decades by both parties have left us vulnerable and weak.  Saying the government was the problem was used to railroad through tax breaks and policies that enriched a limited few.  Add in campaign finance that made them even more powerful and here we are.  The only questions are have we woke us to this and are we willing to make the drastic changes we need to right the ship.

Elizabeth Warren is on the right track, but we need 10 times her number to make the shift we need.  What would really help is that if some of the richest (Bill Gates, Lauren Jobs, etc.) confessed openly to the American public about what has gone on and demand an increase in their taxes and a wealth tax.  Tax payers must demand a sovereign wealth fund so that government sponsored R&D is not given away to enrich the tech companies.  Similar to how AIG was handled any support to corporation during this time must result in large pay backs to tax payers.  Big government means more safety and resilience for all Americans,  No doubt it needs to be managed, but not destroyed and weakened as we have been doing.  We have the resources, we just need to take them from billionaires who live in 5 mansions or more!  And we need to create a system where wealth creation is shared with all."
2020-03-20 20:26:56,"Our system is obviously rigged, when a senator profiteer  from the misery of others , when implicated asks a more corrupt fellow GOP senator to exonerate him.  For those who are shocked by the profiteering these four senators, electing the likes of them means  you are the enablers of these criminals. When progressives like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie tried implicate the systemic corruption and the rig system of our politics, their voices were silent by those who benefit from this system, mainly the GOP and corporate media but also corporate democrats like Feinstein. Frankly as a Californian I am not shocked by Feinstein's actions. 

Given all that has happen,  no one is shocked that the three GOP senators are implicated of this financial crime, however Feinstein proves that political corruption penetrated both parties. If democrats wanted a better America, they would have chosen candidates opposite of those endorsed by the likes of Feinstein. Sadly they didn't! Perhaps this is the reason why Millennials gravitated toward progressive candidates and feel their futures are mortgaged by their baby boomer parents who are too afraid to make the right choice for all of us."

Burr's ""crime"" is he didn't alert the world timely. That's unfair. Trump took a hard position that a hoax was occurring. Alerting the public of the pending pandemic would have put Burr in Trump's cross hairs.
In fact, Burr did signal the alert. He did it with low visibility; but he did it.
Financial bankers get information not available to the investing public. Information about supply chain deficiencies; about competition; about product failures not known by the public. They act on that knowledge.
Burr acted as a prudent investor. Maybe he had information not otherwise available but anyone with vision should have seen the risks of staying in the market.

Who knows how many folks will get sick or die, who otherwise wouldn't have, had this bunch including Burr and Loeffler not fallen all over themselves to claim the virus was nothing, and a Democratic party hoax? To make matters worse, Burr said precisely the opposite to small and select audiences. Burr and Loeffler must resign now. And the Merkley-Brown legislation which, among other things, requires lawmakers to put their assets into blind trusts, should be passed now. Molly Ivans had a word for people like these who will not and cannot stop putting power, profits and politics over the human lives of everyday Americans.

Look at Wikipedia their list of conflicts of interest regarding Feinstein/Blum runs to pages not 1500 characters. I am a life long Democrat but the obscene level of what this party has devolved too is deplorable, both parties as well as their media friends whether Fox or The Times need to get back to helping the Middle Class not waste our time criticizing the other party, not only is it an obvious charade as you all from both parties retreat to your mutual playgrounds in Aspen and The Hamptons:  you have destroyed America’s working class we now have” you” the wealthy neo liberals and wealthy neo conservatives  and the “rest of us” fighting over scraps.

This is beyond disgusting.

Unethical behavior like this is all too common in the Senate. Analysis has uncovered it again and again, and it is not limited to one party.  Biden must speak out forcefully on this, and name names, including Feinstein's."
2020-03-20 22:20:56,"Don't be fooled for one second by Tucker Carlson throwing Senator Burr under the bus.  Burr wasn't running for reelection anyway, so no loss there for the Republican wingnuts.  No, Carlson and other right-wing propaganda sites (Federalist, Daily Caller etc) are using their ""outrage"" against Burr to DISTRACT from Trump's massive failings in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Distraction and shifting blame are Trump's key tactics, and his lackeys in the media are using them now to help him."
2020-03-20 16:53:04,Diane Feinstein - your state is one of the worst hit by this crisis. How about about donating some of your windfall to California hospitals / charities?  The same goes for Senators Burr and Loeffler.

Did he tell the American public? NO. He told his GOP cronies and kept his mouth shut so he didnt upset dear leader.

Martha Stewart went to jail for just this reason, Senator Loeffler is married to a chairman at NYSE. That should mean both of them needs to resign from their respective jobs.

If we didnt have a corrupt AG, the SEC should be prosecuting Burr, Loeffler, Johnson and Inhofe."
2020-03-20 16:31:02,"Unconscionable! Burr, Feinstein, Loeffler, Inhofe, etc....protect yourself at the expense of everyone else. Cognitively a reptilian response rather than a neocortex override regarding what is best for all. These are the ""best and brightest""...what a laugh!"
2020-03-20 13:39:09,"Maybe what Burr meant by “better prepared than ever before” was that...
A.) the country was not prepared *at*all*, and...
B.) he, for one, had just put in a call to his broker telling him to prepare a sell order, ergo...
C.) The country was (ever so slightly) better prepared.

Technically, his Fox editorial would thus have been true."

2020-03-19 11:07:49,This is so sad. My heart goes out to this grieving family.
2020-03-19 11:14:10,"Heartbreaking for this family. Our delayed mobilization and testing is measured in these lives and others. I am so, so sad that this loving family had to suffer this horrendous consequence."
2020-03-19 11:15:47,My heart goes out to this family. Sending LOVE.
2020-03-19 11:18:01,"Condolences to the Fusco family. This resonates clearly for me as I come from an Italian-American family with 12 siblings and 57 first cousins. The family size is exponential after that. For decades our family history is marked by frequent family gatherings with a large group of family members and friends. Most of us are self-quarantined but it's hard for gregarious family-oriented people like us to be contained. Some members are still planning Easter gathering but stories like this will make us pause, for sure."
2020-03-19 11:21:11,This is incredibly sad. It also makes one think “how will I survive”. At this point for me and mine I’m hoping that my ancestors experience with prison camps and foul conditions has given us the biome to survive.
2020-03-19 11:22:21,Showing this close-knit family as they were in health and happiness makes the loss even more shocking.
2020-03-19 11:25:12,"I think this indicates the virus has different strains, with different levels of lethality.  internationally, this seems to be the case in Europe.  Italy reports close to 3000 dead despite an excellent healthcare system.  2,257 are in critical condition. Italy and France appear to have stopped reporting new cases and deaths.  Just north of Italy is Germany, Switzerland and Austria all with comparable demographics to Italy.  Yet, Germany has reported only 31 coronavirus fatalities out of 12,000 cases. Just 2 people are in critical condition i.e. 1000 times fewer than Italy.
The only explanation is different strains of the virus are currently present in Europe,  one mild and the other severe. This large family in New Jersey would appear to have been hit a more lethal variant.  The problem we have for public health is that we have no idea what strains of the virus are present in the U.S. population and whether strains present overseas will migrate to the United States. One would have to assume the worse."
2020-03-19 11:25:32,"Things could have gone much better if not for the test debacle that took so long, it should never have happened.

 My condolences to the family.

 I hope you get through this extremely challenging period and that the 4 children in hospital make a speedy recovery   
 and you can all be together and support each other following the quarantine."
2020-03-19 11:28:28,"My heart and sincere condolences goes out the Fusco family.

Such unimaginable grief.

I fear similar fates may occur due to this horrific virus.

My husband and I continue to cherish each day together because no one is certain what tomorrow may bring.

Thank you to all the commenters for sharing your thoughts and points of view.  Not being able to gather at work or socially, these comments help fill in those gaps where interesting conversation is valued now more than ever.

Good luck everyone and truly take care."
2020-03-19 11:39:58,"I keep reading that families, friends, etc. still want to get together and people find it ""so difficult"" not to attend dinners, celebrations, etc.  And, can't it be a small group, playdates for kids and so on.   No, no, and no!  Please, please, PLEASE do not make exceptions.  Everyone needs to practice social distancing and when really required; isolation.  Compared to illness and possibly death there is no downside to doing this."
2020-03-19 11:40:03,"Why are there 27 community members in the hospital under observation while waiting for test results? They are taking up hospital beds which could be given to people who actually test positive. These 27 people should self-isolate themselves until the results of the test come back. If individual self-isolation is not possible, then maybe the state should create isolation centers, as a staging area: those that test negative go home, those that test positive go to a hospital.

In addition to those who have tested positive for coronavirus at CentraState, a midsize hospital that operates as a nonprofit, 27 community members who have been tested for the virus but are awaiting results are hospitalized under observation, Dr. Matera said on Wednesday.

He said the lengthy turnaround time for test results leaves patients in the dark and burdens the hospital’s limited resources. Patients who might ultimately test negative for coronavirus, and be healthy enough to leave the hospital, are instead being kept in isolation.

If tests were returned more quickly, more patients could be discharged.

“That opens up beds,” Dr. Matera said. “It lowers the anxiety of the staff.”"
2020-03-19 11:40:47,"My sincere condolences to this wonderful family. Few of us are as close knit as they have been.
But, is it just coincidence that this is an Italian American family and that Italy has been the country most devastated by this virus. Is it in the genetics of Italians and those of Italian descent or is it a strain networking through Italian communities, from Italy to the US?"
2020-03-19 11:46:30,"There are really only two choices here. One is a more severe strain of the virus. The other is something unique in the family genetics. Either way, we need organized scientific studies of those who survived a serious bout and those who did not to determine which situation. A few weeks ago I read that some researchers believed there were two strains, one less contagious but more severe (30%) and the other more contagious but mild ((70%). These articles have disappeared from the news but now we have this unfortunate cluster of deaths. It also appeared to be the pattern in China with greatest severity at the onset of the outbreak, which furthered the suggestion in the early article that the severe strain was the original zoonotic strain and the milder form was the mutation. We need research, not fear mongering. And obviously to stay at a distance from others."
2020-03-19 11:38:23,"NYT, thank you for this sad but illuminating article.  Our family was already discussing putting Easter dinner plans on hold.  After reading this article, the decision is obvious."
2020-03-19 11:15:34,Absolutely awful for the whole family and perplexing for medical people. There is always the hope that the reason may in the end protect others - not a great comfort. I know the Chinese authorities said people with blood group A seemed more affected than those of Type O.
2020-03-19 11:40:09,What was the length of time from the Tuesday dinner with the person connected to John Brennan  til the Fuscos hospitalization and death? It seems like it all happened way faster than I thought possible.  God Bless this family !
2020-03-19 11:29:03,"Wow. This is awful. So many family members sick and none of them can visit or help care for each other! Those who are in serious condition are probably wondering if they will die next. *sigh* And it is inexcusable that one of them died prior to know her diagnosis.

I’m wondering if it is best that the mother died not knowing about her children. The main question I have now is, how do they mourn??? None of them can comfort each other! Imagine what that must be like, especially for a family that close. Now what? They have funerals and burials to plan for, yet everyone from that family is in isolation. They can’t properly prepare, nor say goodbye. When do they have the funerals? How does this work? This poor family. Oh this is just heart-breaking. God be with them."
2020-03-19 11:50:04,"Reading through these comments makes it clear that the tragedy that has befallen the Fusco family will likely be repeated across the country. I wonder how many families will have to suffer before people cancel parties, holiday celebrations, and large religious gatherings?"
2020-03-19 11:39:27,There are 27 people sick enough to be hospitalized with suspected coronavirus in a community hospital and all of them are still awaiting test to results as to whether they have the virus or not!??! Beyond unbelievable.
2020-03-19 11:54:38,"Of course we are sympathetic to this huge family, but somewhere between Mar 10 and March 18, it appears they held a great big family dinner at which at least one guest was infected.  This, despite almost constant warnings about the virus and the knowledge that someone within the racing industry nearby had just died.  YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE.  Look what happens when you ignore warnings.  
I am hopeful that more and more families will see this terrible event and start cancelling holiday gatherings, no matter how small.  Doctors and nurses and hospital staff who are trained in infection control and are wearing garments designed to prevent the spread of infection are getting sick. This isn't something that happens to somebody else!  All the people at that dinner who are not actively sick should be under self-quarantine, hoping that they haven't just infected a loved one in their own home or neighborhood.  All those kisses and hugs..."

Condolences to the entire family"
2020-03-19 12:03:19,"When we talk about “flattening the curve”, turnaround time for tests is a systemic issue that needs to be a focus for improvement. Either the CDC and US-based labs need to fix this quickly, or we need to be willing to cooperate with the WHO to get better tests. As the doctor said, we need to end the bureaucratic hold, and either treat people or free up beds."
2020-03-19 12:03:46,"People need to take the social distancing seriously. Yesterday I saw  news reports on all the twenty-somethings who went to Spring Break in FLA because ""this was planned for a long time"", ""I'm just living for the moment"", and ""I just want to have fun"". WHAT???!!! 

The leadership in this country needs to wake up and emphasize the need for taking this seriously. 

We can do it people. If we do it now, we will live to resume regular life in a little while. As someone pointed out, Anne Frank spent TWO YEARS in isolation. She couldn't leave that small space. No sunshine, no internet, no audio books, no FaceTime, no tv. We can do a few months."
2020-03-19 12:04:51,Heartbreaking. God bless this family and let us all learn from their tragedy.
2020-03-19 12:05:33,"This is why we must consider ourselves carriers of COVID-19. The exponential threat of exposure to the virus is not to be taken lightly. Getting tested is the best defense, but I likely won’t get tested, at least in the foreseeable future, because I’m currently asymptomatic. Tests are not readily available making it impossible to know if I’m infected or not, which is why our lives have been turned upside down. Self-isolating may be socially trending but it’s our best defense and the most responsible action to take."
2020-03-19 12:07:26,"I read that repeated exposure to the virus can make symptoms worse. Is it possible that these people were infected, asymptomatic, and got infected again? It's an incredibly sad story."
2020-03-19 12:08:25,No family deserves this kind of devastating news and to know that others are still in critical care. These are the people who could have been saved this by a loud and serious warning. We all have naysayers in our circles and this is the kind of example to bring out at who the vulnerable are and that if we aren't at risk of dying ourselves there are those we care about who are at risk.
2020-03-19 12:18:27,"While the human toll is tragic, this is not a novel situation by any means as tranmission vectors in Wuhan were most often centered around familial clusters.  The implications for cultures which hold traditional values, religious observance, attendance at ceremonies is stark - this virus will wipe out families the same way the 1918 Flu pandemic did.   For groups such as the Amish, devout Muslims, Catholics  and Ultra Orthodox Jews and others who may live in tight knit communities with larger than average families, the risks are stark as the pandemic can rage like a  wildfire and decimate entire families.  The clash between traditional values favoring community, cultural and religious traditions and imperatives and modernity is very real and  will exact a very high price   on people and ultimately on us all as our health delivery systems are overwhelmed.    The need to avoid large gatherings, wedding, funerals, religious services, and events  cannot be understated.   Of course, such a lifestyle change undermines and threatens the cohesion and community of these communities so it is very difficult to change social morays and regrettably, many of the imans, rabbis and priests are simply not that well versed in regard to the immediate need for  pandemic prevention so community outreach and dialogue is critical."
2020-03-19 12:22:56,"My paternal grandmother lost a 2 year old son, and two days later her husband during the 1918 Flu Pandemic, in October, in Manhattan.  She was also sick but somehow survived, as did their 6 year old daughter.  We will hear more stories of families suffering multiple losses I fear."
2020-03-19 12:25:26,"The suddenness of the deaths in the Fusco family is traumatic & very saddening.
The article re-emphasises the need for self imposed “social isolation “ more than ever in bypassing the perils of the Corona Virus.
Added to which to which is the need to avoid touching relics of Saints.
I send my heartfelt condolences to the Fusco family & pray God to heal the family members in hospital.
It’s high time for all the governments of the world to pool funds collectively to research and find cure for this deadly Virus at the earliest."
2020-03-19 12:26:33,"The thing is beyond the three people in this family, A fourth person from that gathering has died as well. That’s right there have been five deaths in New Jersey. One of them was a 90 something-year-old man. But the other four were from one gathering… Three family members, who conceivably could have the same genetics, and a fourth person not related.

A particular virulent strain? And if so what are we doing to track it down? Because I find it incredulous that all over this country and all over the world there are people who may have been physically similar to this family and age demographic and lifestyle and all survived. But these 3+ the fourth friend all died And the number of the relatives are in critical condition in the hospital."

2020-03-19 11:30:42,"This is an absolutely tragic result of Donald Trump’s government’s choices to:

-Downplay and minimize this virus FOR WEEKS/MONTHS not preparing 
-firing the entire Obama era pandemic team in 2018 - to save money
-refusing to (or being incapable of) managing a comprehensive response 
-clearing the executive branch of capable non-partisan professionals and replacing them with political appointees with zero experience 
-not using the lead time we had to produce the masks, ventilators and gloves that are now in dwindling supply nationwide 

Imagine if we all had been warned and preparing for this instead of still today 3/19/20 not knowing the full extent of the spread because we are only now BEGINNING to tests who has it. 

The personal, financial and societal impact of this is horrific and could have been minimized with someone else in charge."

At times it is hard to be isolated and alone, yet, here I am, surviving, by using social media, and as much as possible, trying to educate those I come into contact with.  Grief is tough, and life changing. 

Warm, close, loving, families, Spanish, Italians, etc, will have to adjust very quickly, it's going to be tough, if your insane President does not get through to the Republican base, soon.

Republicans, according to the polls, are not taking the advice of experts on board, as much as other political affiliations."

2020-03-19 12:37:44,"Considering the exorbitant number of deaths in Italy, and the Fusco’s ethnicity,I wonder if it’s logical to add the possibility of a genetic vulnerability to this particular virus as the cause of their contracting it and dying from it.

2020-03-19 12:52:51,"My sincere condolences to the Fusco Family.  The susceptibility of the Fusco family, together with the proliferation of COVID-19 in Italy suggests a genetic component.

I suspect we are all at risk and they don’t really understand who goes down with it and who doesn’t"
2020-03-19 12:57:16,"Thank you for your coverage of this family's tragic story. My thoughts and prayers go out to them.

I live and work in the community where this tragedy is unfolding, and we have been told very little about it, nothing from our local or state government. It's barely mentioned in our local newspaper, and no one is reaching out to us with accurate information or direct warnings apart from the usual--and this situation is unusual,  for sure. Rumors abound, but no one knows what's true.

Beyond this family, how many other people could have been exposed recently at our local businesses and schools? We have absolutely no way of knowing, and that make me very uneasy. Not that we would want people to panic, but this story indicates that those of us in Freehold and the surrounding areas need to follow this situation closely, and drastically limit our outside interactions to the bare minimum for the time being , self-quarantining if necessary.

I wish someone official here would keep our residents updated and informed, and issue whatever strong and clear directives we, as a community, need to follow right here, right now,  not a week from now, to contain what could become a serious community spread--if it hasn't already. 

People have a tendency to think general warnings don't apply to them...but this applies to all of us, especially those of us here in Freehold."
2020-03-19 13:06:19,"Of course we need to increase research into strains of the disease and potential genetic or other susceptibilities. But let's look at some of the clusters we have seen:

--a church in South Korea;
--a synagogue in New Rochelle; and
--a large Italian-American family in New Jersey.

The only common thread here is the likelihood of close physical contact among a large number of people at a single event (religious services or a family gathering).

This just emphasizes the need to be consistent and persistent in social distancing and self isolation. And cleaning and disinfecting.

And we should not fool ourselves: this will continue for months, not weeks. Maybe even longer. We are slowing, not stopping, the spread of the virus until we can implement swift and accurate testing on a massive scale and spare our hospital bed and ventilator capacity. But thanks to lack of preparation that is all we can do right now. and given the people in charge, I am not expecting vaccines, or cures, or even adequate tests in the near future."
2020-03-19 13:11:10,"Testing, Testing, Testing.

Why is it taking so long to get tests and then slow for results?  There will certainly be an investigation as to why the CDC chose to not use the tried and true WHO test with millions already used.  

Instead the CDC chose to develop their own from scratch and then right out of the gate it proved to be defective.  This grossly slowed down the release of data as to how big a problem we have.  
As Trump would say, ""People are saying Trump wanted to sabotage the release of the bad news."" It has backfired."
2020-03-19 13:11:44,"Apologies if this is a duplicate, but I wonder if the family, since they were involved with horses, had ever had farmer's lung? It is tied to exposure to agriculture related mold found in hay and having allergies to it.  Hay, silage, greenhouses, are some of the sources.  Another possibility is agriculture pulmonary fibrosis."
2020-03-19 13:13:20,"My sympathies to this family. Seriously though, lets print this story to help spread panic, instead of a majority of cases where people had/have the sniffles."
2020-03-19 13:07:40,The person who infected them possibly was shedding the virus in large numbers and these people received a Large Inoculate. That seems to be a factor in how ill people get. Touch a surface that has the virus on it and then your face you get mild symptoms and recover in a couple weeks. Breath in a large dose of the virus the result much worse. That would explain why and how the doctors who have fallen succumbed.
2020-03-19 13:02:31,"I have 2 comments, one about the virus and transmission, and the other is political. For the record, I'm a physician.

Some folks here are talking about a super-strain of virus that's emerging. And although that's possible because of strain drift (mutations evolving as virus is passed through a population), I think the ""super spreader"" notion is more likely. There's been  reports out this week, based on look-back analyses in SE Asia, about the importance of clusters in advancing spread. Within those clusters (this family gathering is a cluster), one or more people act as super spreaders, i.e., every cough, breath, etc has a lot more infectious punch than average. That could be related to their genetics or their immune handling of the virus, in other words, not just attributes of the virus. (I think this is also what happened with the New Rochelle cluster.) It all reinforces the social distancing concept, even in families.

As for politics, Senator Ron Johnson's recent comments, questioning the need to shut down the economy over all this, when in fact 97-99% will emerge from this just fine, are absolutely incredible and dangerously naive. Who knows, maybe one of his loved ones will need an ICU bed for non-COVID reasons during all this, and one won't be available. Just saying."
2020-03-19 13:18:53,Is anyone doing studies on the virus’ effect on different ethnicities? It’s not lost on me that this is an Italian-American family and Italy has been hit so hard. Is there a genetic component to this that can give us a clue how to develop a vaccine or figure out who is most vulnerable? Like the BRCA gene for breast cancer? Or is that not how viruses work? Serious question.
2020-03-19 13:16:55,Is it possible there has been some contact within the family with people who had recently visited Italy or had some contact with relatives from Italy who unknowingly may have been carriers of the virus without evident symptoms yet?
2020-03-19 13:18:51,"Can't see a definite date when they suspect transmission - another article refered to this as saying it was March 10, but that's not enough time unless it's become more aggressive.

This is a big family with a lot of contact with the community. 
 This article cites a retreat on Feb 29 with ""minimal contact"", but that's not definitive.  China said 80% of transmission was within families.  People NEED to be careful... like covering faces even in the home.  Face coverings like a doubled-over T-shirt won't stop inhaling the virus, but WILL stop spittle from infecting others - I've noticed droplets on my phone's protective cover.

We waited too long to get serious about this."
2020-03-19 13:19:47,"How sad and tragic. Deepest sympathies for a tragedy whose effect might have been lessened or avoided by better preparation by the  ""powers that be"" earlier in the year...it is NOT like the ""common cold""!  
Other nations have lessened impact by massive testing...unavailable here. I don't know about others, but I am not enjoying ""less government"" right now as the eviscerated CDC and NIH try to ramp up after massive cuts. 
We were not ready, nor did we get ready, despite all evidence. Trump trying to save the stock market, with his early denials of the danger, resulted in sacrificing citizens, and is an unconscionable  crime. My heart breaks for this loving family. Deepest sympathy."
2020-03-19 13:22:18,"the initial inoculum of virus may be key to how aggressive the virus can impact morbidity and mortality in patients exposed -- regardless of other factors including age and sex.  in large gatherings   droplets with thousands of viral particles can inoculate  unknowing  members  of that gathering resulting in a raging illness that can lead to death and spread to others in secondary encounters.  Key to preventing  us from getting the virus is understanding how it spreads thru droplets, aerosols and fomites. An Zhu, M.D. et al initial NEJM may have been misleading about aerosols and fomites not being contributing factors. But more recent ""correspondance "" by Neeltje van Doremalen at the NIH recently published in NEJM suggests  aerosols and fomites as plausible ways to be exposed to the COVID 19.   LImiting large groups of people is very reasonable and probably effective in preventing spread. Stay six feet away from others  may prevent droplet exposure
Strong  evidence that masks help prevent exposure  to the virus is lacking  but i believe its reasonable to wear a mask to reduce viral load that one can be exposed to especially in enclosed environments like offices or conference rooms.  washing your hands constantly with soap or disinfectant  is also a reasonable ploy to help prevent contamination. changing clothes frequently  and bathing more frequently may also help when we have to take risks and venture out of our own homes."

2020-03-19 13:41:10,"Utterly Devestating. Not far from this tragedy in Freehold yesterday, thousands of workers from the Jersey Shores favorite restaurants furloughed thousands of workers. Unlike teachers & other government workers who have guaranteed pay, these workers are standing online today to claim paltry benefits they may not ever receive (the online system crashed). While picking up a meal from a restaurant I aim to support during this crisis, I saw far too many people still out and about, playing contact sports, having outdoor play dates, and other virus spreading endeavors.

I know what it means to have a complete work stoppage of all non-essential services and business activity in any of our major National economic arteries and I empathize with Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Murphy for trying to maintain some semblance of economic productivity while they conveniently appease their donors who continue to unilaterally advocate for their businesses, but this tragedy demonstrates why it all needs to shut down Right Now.  China ultimately curtailed this virus because they turned a regular holiday stoppage into a longer shutdown. While they party in non-income collecting Florida, we must survive and get well soon here or the entire country struggles economically, including insensitive Florida.

For non-essential business Owners, please find a way to use the stoppage for preventative maintenance, inventory reconciliation, online training.  People need work from home opportunities more than ever now."
2020-03-19 13:50:30,"Does anyone yet know:  Does the severity of the illness in an otherwise healthy person depend upon the duration of the exposure? Can one become sick enough to die just by walking past someone who transmits the disease, or is it from prolonged and close exposure? Studying situations such as that with this family might help with just one more piece of understanding everything about this virus."
2020-03-19 13:57:59,"So sad. I think as time goes on they will start to see more individual circumstances that apply to others, and I have a feeling it will not stop at one. There are ongoing studies regarding the differences in severity among people.In China, they are seeing young healthy doctors and scientists who have not only been exposed to covid-19, but other coronaviruses as well, who have very severe symptoms, opposed to others in the community. It is also possible that workers in wet markets are also exposed repeatedly to this family of viruses floating around, therefore building up antibodies.What is happening in many of these cases is possible antibody dependent enhancement, where the antibodies just go crazy and cover the lungs with white blood cells, therefore developing into pneumonia. This is a virus that wants to coexist, and there is no real information yet on reinfection, although the MO of viruses is to eventually respond to a herd immunity, either by a vaccine or exposure. We are essentially buying time because the current situation is unsustainable. We may have to go to vulnerable/elderly isolation, who knows until a vaccine can be produced. But it takes time because virologists need to be concerned about-antibody dependent enhancement, which is a big consideration in the production of vaccines.There is much still to be discovered, and as it is a fast mutating virus, it's unnerving. I am just a layperson interested in the the uncharted waters whose map we've had for a while."

I'm just a retail worker, no scientist, but even I know that correlation does not equal causation.  Unless the virus has different strains showing up in different areas of the world (it's only been a few months, is that likely?), what genetic component is tying together China, Italy, Iran?"
2020-03-19 14:28:48,"This is heartbreaking, but there will be many more stories like this.

First, the US is in for a worse-than-China-level outbreak, because there was no early testing and no contract tracing as in Singapore, Taiwan or South Korea. There will be tens of thousands of deaths, and - unless harsh quarantine measures rigorously enforced - hundreds of thousands, or even millions.

Second - and I don't want to insult the Fuscos here - 60% of Americans are overweight or obese, which means that millions suffer from weight-related illnesses such as Diabetes II, which makes also younger adults particularly vulnerable to the virus.

There is no chance to avert disaster now, but it is still possible to avert total catastrophe if America hunkers down."
2020-03-19 14:35:38,"The story doesn't mention if there was anybody at the dinner from Italy, surely a significant detail. It does document that a single family of this size can be a center of contagion. We can't put ourselves in a cocoon, but we can all be vigilant when we need groceries or car maintenance or anything that can't be delivered to our doors. I hope those in this family in critical care survive and heal. For the rest of us, it's an instructive story of how we must proceed for the next month or two or more."
2020-03-19 14:36:30,"So sad. NJ and NY should do what China did - close everything for a  few weeks (limited exceptions -supermarkets would be allowed but shoppers will need gloves, masks and there should be tighter controls on crowds).

It's puzzling, too, that the doctor does not mention obesity as an underlying condition.  Even without any obesity related co-morbidities, an obese person's body has to work harder at everything than a non-obese person."

2020-03-19 14:50:21,"The tragedy that has enveloped this fine family, and which, it seems, has not yet resolved itself, gives my heart a squeeze. As I sit at home with my wife and children, all of us still without symptoms, none of us exposed to our knowledge, preparing for the weeks of self-isolation yet to come, I am puzzled by what stands for good fortune in this COVID-19 world. As family quartermaster, I have been spending many more hours than usual structuring our food and supplies order for the week, which we have delivered (due to my being handicapped, and there being a local grocer who has set up local deliveries in areas that, fortunately, include ours). I have been stressing out over how to get toilet paper in the house, since we will run out in a week, or paper towels, or certain high demand foods, or sanitizing products. How stressful for me. And trying to see through to the end of the self-isolation, hoping we all keep our tempers and our wits. How stressful for us. Not really. Three members of one family dead, and twenty or so more relations under threat of contagion or death, from the novel coronavirus; an entire church, its priest, and its congregation under observation because of there having been a gathering of people to break bread together. My heart feels the squeeze again as I write this. May there be no further casualties from that gathering, and may our scientists swiftly find a prevention and a cure for this new scourge that now threatens the Big Blue Marble we call home."

2020-03-19 14:54:19,"This is really sad. But we do have to consider one important question - does susceptibility to the virus have a genetic basis?

We know that some people seem to have virtually no symptoms, and others, as in this tragic case, seem to readily fall to the virus.

We must tremendously step up our research into these pathogens - it can't be left to our worthless ""For Profit"" drug industry.  We need research that is not product oriented. 

Capitalism does ""not ring the bell"" in every case.  The ridiculous old man, Bernie Sanders, was right about a lot of things - this is one of them.

However, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure have all been listed as serious risk factors and judging by the photo I'm guessing some of the family members here were dealing with some of these health issues."

While I continue to be a very boisterous critic of Trump and his administration's mishandling and bungling of this crisis, the consequences of those misguided and flatly wrong decisions are clearly being felt and actualized as the Fusco family tragedy illustrates.

Making difficult and painful decisions today in not gathering for any reason with family or friends could save lives tomorrow and the days/weeks to follow.

This is a story about a devastated family...not about whether fat people who ate a lot of carbs should have changed their lifestyle years ago. The fault right now is squarely with our federal government: it should have listened to the experts and taken decisive action immediately. Even now, it is still not being treated seriously enough. Meanwhile, the potential for this happening has been documented for years, notably in ""The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?"" published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine. Whether pandemics or climate change, our government treats the scientific community like the cliche, eccentric scientists in 1950s monster movies: no one listens until the threat is ringing the doorbell."

The principle behind containing a virus is simple. Isolate people from contact with other people and places to prevent the virus from spreading. Period. Now do whatever is required to implement this.

If you don't like a system where the well-to-do have access and you don't, a system where health care is not equally available to everyone and a system which operates upon a profit motive then change the system. The Democrats had their chance to make far-reaching changes with Bernie but decided that they prefer Biden. 

Fair enough; this shows that they don't want change in any meaningful way. And, by the same token, stop complaining about the system. It's operating as intended.

Democrats will get what they have chosen. In all likelihood, that's 4 more years of Trump but either way, the oligarchy will remain intact and the system will remain unchanged."

The 3 huge risk factors for death from COVID-19. Obesity is at an epidemic in America. It's also an epidemic in Italy, Iran, and much of Europe. Places like Japan (low obesity rate), seem to have COVID-19 under control. People tend to become more insulin resistant as they age, because years of bad eating + time = insulin resistance, which progressively gets worse as time goes on.

--------------------------------
Ms. Fusco-Jackson’s relatives also believe that speedier test results could have made a difference in her care.

“They didn’t treat her as a confirmed case because everything is so delayed,” Ms. Paradiso Fodera said. “It’s a big bureaucracy. The testing result time is important.”
----------------------------------

Leadership failure from the very top of our government is responsible for the slow responseas evidenced by lack of testing capability and lack of personal protective equipment like surgical masks, gloves and face shields. Not to mention our lagging health care system capacity to handle these viral outbreaks that have ravaged the world especially in the past few decades. 

Donald Trump's refusal to acknowledge the seriousness of this pandemic early enough to make a difference and his closure of a White House national security office for planning and prevention of Global Biohazards two years ago is unforgivable and has led to this families irreversible suffering and countless others to come."
2020-03-19 15:29:28,"Speaking of obesity ....

I'm not. But about 15 years back, I spent a long day at a deservedly famous amusement park in NW Ohio. I mistakenly thought I'd happened upon a convention of obese people, since nearly everyone I passed was way overweight. I soon learned that there was no convention going on at this amusement park -- I was just seeing a cross-section of the American public, and it's probably gotten worse in the past 15 years.

Not being a physician, I can't comment knowledgeably on what the results of obesity are. I can, however, note that, whatever those consequences may be, the US must be suffering them."

This is one of likely millions of stories of families being wiped out many due to what should be criminally-liable consequences for the administration covering up the pandemic for their usual financial gain.

We received an email from our Congresswoman last night reminding people to prepare and put plans in place if the house is all ill.  Have a plan to have your pet(s) taken care of IN ADVANCE of your becoming ill.

Our wills and legal papers were done last yiear, so we're just adding some things outside of it to be clear.
But folks (especially seniors) be prepared for the worst and hope we'll be fine.  If you can think, hang on to your head (we want to bury ours but can't).

2020-03-19 15:12:24,"Does the NY Times have it wrong?

So it appears. Trump has been criticized, deservedly in my view, for proposing an elimination of certain payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare deductions). I gather that suggestion has gone nowhere, for two reasons:

1. Its effect would take much too long.
2. Reducing payroll taxes obviously wouldn't help those who've lost their jobs.

Is the Times guilty of the same sin? It recently ran a story titled ""Trump Seeks $500 Billion in Checks for Taxpayers,"" which obviously means checks would be sent only to people who are still paying taxes, NOT to those who've lost their jobs and probably need the checks the most. 

Is that really the proposal? As I read that article, the proposal is for the federal government to send one (maybe two) checks to American adults and children REGARDLESS of whether they are ""taxpayers"" (i.e., still have a job). 

Is the Times headline correct? Only ""taxpayers"" are to get checks?"

2020-03-19 15:36:15,"This is tragic and my condolences to this family. 
I wanted to remind people that in Wuhan in Jan and Feb, COVID-19 has wiped out many families (grandparents, parents, even kids under 18) entirely, just like this one. Sadly, this NJ case will not be a surprising outlier, if people here in the US do not practice STRICT self-quarantine at home, NOW. 
Besides having dinner together, the Wuhan experience also shows that home isolation of confirmed cases (even with mild symptoms at the beginning) could be dangerous. It proved difficult for family members who were living with confirmed cases to avoid infection. COVID-19 is highly infectious, could live on surfaces for days, and many people here lack basic disinfectant products to clean their homes thoroughly and timely. This is why the Chinese government decided to use lots of temporary quarantine spot to isolate confirmed cases with no or mild symptoms in early Feb.
Here in NY and other big cities in the US, many people live in extremely cramped apt, or have to share rooms and even bathrooms with non-family members. Their living conditions are much worse than Wuhan people who contracted the virus from home isolated family members.  I am very concerned about the widespread practice of asking confirmed cases to simply isolate at home here. Something must be done very quickly, or we will see a surge of cases from family infection."

We’re fighting another war with another profound family tragedy.
Sadly, the first of others to follow. We must learn to behave as if we are infected by the virus. We have the choice and responsibility the Sullivan boys did not have. We must make those choices."
2020-03-19 15:41:08,This is a horribly sad story but hopefully it will reinforce the notion that this is a deadly virus and not to be taken lightly.  I am appalled at some of the media members and politicians like Devin Nunes and the governor of Oklahoma who were encouraging people to dine at restaurants or continue with their normal lives.  This should be a giant wake-up call to the deniers and skeptics.
2020-03-19 15:49:39,"Has anyone heard anything about a potentially stronger strain of the virus, as mentioned in the article? Seems to be a topic glanced over in other pieces. I've been reading stories of younger, healthier people getting really sick. Yesterday our family doctor confirmed there were multiple strains out there, and so does this article, albeit they do mention the potency and devastation of this case to be rare."
2020-03-19 15:42:54,"Some of these comments are deliberately cruel. What is it about Americans and this culture of blame? This stricken family is suffering and all some of us can do is pick them apart and blame them for their misfortune?  Hey, how about the slim and otherwise healthy who die from the virus - what were THEIR faults? The main fault in this country is an unworkable for-profit medical system  totally unprepared for this type of world-wide emergency though they had been warned over and over again. The fault also lies with the dimwit in the W.H. who got rid of the scientists and the NSC pandemic agency set up by former President Obama and who is currently pretending to be presidential while having denied this was aii happening until just a few days ago. The fault also lies with a republican party unwilling to meet this disaster head on because it doesn't fit their political agenda and God forbid might hurt their 401Ks. Yet here we are. 
At this time of great tragedy in our country, it doesn't help ANYONE to blame people for their  misfortunes, especially when we all need to band together (metaphorically) to defeat an invisible scourge.

Someone, or more than one person, at the dinner gave them COVID-19.  The question is who was the person with the risk factor.

To be frank, either one of them went to Italy and contracted it there, or works with people from overseas.  The fact that three close members of the family contracted it points to tasting the dishes and sharing a spoon...now we know that's NOT a good idea.

I also wonder about their symptoms - I see more and more on medical news about GI symptoms - upset stomach and diarrhea - being more important than people and even doctors think.  Any respiratory symptoms plus upset stomach and/or diarrhea should lead to testing for coronavirus."

2020-03-19 16:03:29,"I agree with Rebecca - after seeing the pictures of the family, obesity played a role in this terrible outcome.  

40% of adults in the US are obese today - the impact of COVID-19 could be even more deadly in the US.

Obesity is a chronic inflammatory state which stresses organs and joints on a 'normal' day.  It is not surprising that people with obesity have less stamina and 'reserve' than healthy people.

My comments are likely to be highly criticized as 'fat-shaming' but the reality is that obesity is the new 'normal' among American adults.  

The AMA recognizes obesity as a disease but very few health professionals can discuss it with their patients with the urgency needed to protect their health."

2020-03-19 16:29:43,"@Kimberly asked: ""Does the severity of the illness in an otherwise healthy person depend upon the duration of the exposure? Can one become sick enough to die just by walking past someone who transmits the disease, or is it from prolonged and close exposure?""

Answer: No, those are two different things. The more time someone spends around someone who is sick, the greater the chance that they will get the virus too.

But *how sick* someone gets depends upon the strength of their immune system. Some people get the virus and have no symptoms because their immune system is strong. Others have a weak immune system and get a severe case. Underlying health issues weaken the immune system, so it's more important than ever to do what we can to be healthy.

There is also some evidence that *this* virus can provoke a strong immune system to over-attack the virus, resulting in an auto-immune type response against the body. It's called a ""cytokine storm"". There needs to be more research done on this. At any rate, keeping our immune system as healthy as possible is a great idea."

t is merciful that the mother died without learning that two of her children died. There is no greater pain  to a parent than the loss of a child. 

I'm  alarmed to learn that young people with no underlying  conditions are dying of coronavirus, as my 44 year old psychologist is in the hospital. He is  hooked up to a respirator.  He has been awaiting results of a coronavirus test for six days.
It seems highly likely that he will test positive. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday , is extremely ill ,and is hooked up to a respirator .It seems unlikely that a healthy 44 year old man would happen to develop pneumonia, unrelated to coronavirus  at this time.

His family , colleagues and patients await the results in dread.
I was panicked about the coronavirus  pandemic before my psychologist ended up on a respirator, Now, I am without the support of my psychologist, terrified that he will die of coronavirus, and that I will.

I'm more terrified that he will die ,than I am of dying myself. 
If he dies, I do not want to live  .He left his own destroyed home behind and  headed out to rescue me from my post-Sandy entrapment. He is an extraordinary individual.

Why area asymptomatic, well-connected individuals being provided results within a day, while there are others who die before their results are ready?

This demonstrates a significant problem remains in the U.S. -- we have a severe lack of test results.  East test result requires three things: (1) test kits, (2) trained medical staff to take samples, and (3) laboratory capacity to quickly run/report on each test.

If any of these are reduced, the entire path to getting Test Results is slowed/stops.  This contributed to deaths.

Why are reporters not asking about the long continuing severe shortage of tests?  (and please, do not bother asking trump -- he will make silly quips, as in: ""We have billions of test kits, they were sent on Friday."")

This has happened in Wuhan for multiple times. Self-quarantine at home has proven to be a failed practice since it greatly increases the risk for other family members. That's why China built 14 temporary hospitals to isolate all mild cases from their families and effectively stopped further spreading of COVID-19.

2020-03-19 19:07:33,"""But the virus’s devastating toll on a single family is considered as rare as it is perplexing"". Really? ! This is exactly the kind of stories we Chinese heard again and again in February from Wuhan. In a highly publicized story, a film director (50+), his sister (50+), and both of his parents (70-80+) all perished within a short period of time. At the moment of his death, his wife was in ICU. Only his son, who happened to be studying in the UK, escaped the ordeal (temporarily). So far the US government has repeated every grave mistake the Chinese government has made: in the first phase, not enough tests were made available for effective tracking of the transmission chain; insufficient protective gear for the health workers to prevent the virus from spreading in the hospital. What is most worrying, is that currently presumptive and mild cases are told to self-quarantine at home. Based on the experiences of Wuhan, self-quarantine DOESN'T work if other family members live under the same roof. You can basically assume that the whole family is going to catch it. The transmission chain in Wuhan really started to break when the government converted stadiums and conference halls into ""mobile cabin hospital"" to segregate the mild cases, and enlisted hotels and universities to house the ""under-observation"" group. Coronavirus respects no ideology, race, or political rhetorics. Why do Americans insist on falling into the same traps?!"

Thereby encouraging uninterrupted transmission for weeks by people who may not have had symptoms or severe effects.  Many of that audience are still not taking this seriously today, beyond the effects on their 401k's, which they blame on the Democrats.

One of my concerns was that while airlines may need help to get through this difficulty, I am not happy about bailouts going to a business that has been gouging the public for many years.  When airlines started to charge baggage fees because of the spike in oil prices, but then did not rescind them after prices came down, it became obvious this was a scam. Especially when they started charging for carry on, as well as checked bags.  Now they look for ways to charge for everything. 

Same goes for hotels that charge resort fees. Why can’t we just decline them? And who decides to stay at a hotel without receiving the perks of staying at a hotel? Like using the pool or having WiFi in 2020? It’s just an extra way to gouge customers without telling them upfront. 

The industries getting bailouts must be prohibited from stock buybacks for an extended time period, and also need to provide insurance and adequate pay to their lower tier employees as part of the requirement of receiving bailouts. The executives should not be the ones that are benefiting from government help, it’s the workers."

Small businesses almost always operate as an LLC, which means they pay no income tax (or very little) as a business, because they withdraw all profits before the year ends.  What McConnell is attempting will not in any way, shape or form help businesses who suffer from a down economy.  It's just another gift to rich people.

For decades, Infectious Diseases specialists have made  less than half of most other doctors, like cardiologists or radiologists, because iD does not do  “procedures” like the other specialties, (most of which, by the way, are unnecessary and self-referred, being performed by the same doctor who “recommended” it, an innate conflict of interest and the main reason why America pays double for its health care compared to the rest of the world).
But now, at the time of crisis, ID is on the front line, working overtime and putting their own lives at risk. 
The ancient methods for fee-for-service not only drive up costs for unnecessary care but are driving down the supply of  doctors for this crucial specialty. To illustrate, the ID specialty programs in the US depend on foreign medical graduates, (who, fortunately for Americans, are very smart and dedicated), to fill over two-thirds of their positions; by contrast, for cardiology, many programs refuse to accept any foreign medical graduates, because they can fill with US medical graduates only.
As long as Senator Thune and all of his other boon-doggie colleagues at the trough are lining up for the free money our heirs will pay in taxes for the next 50 years, maybe someone in Washington DC can be fair and foresighted enough to care about those who give care when it’s needed most."

Safe work, socially distanced...

How hard can it be for the wealthiest nation in the world to place money first and foremost into the hands of an exponentially growing population of Americans now without work?  How hard can it be to immediately produce more ventilators as we experience the numbers of those afflicted with Covid-19 and subsequent deaths multiply minute by minute during a 24 hour period?  And our health professionals on the front line of this war against a microscopic enemy daily risk becoming more and more vulnerable because of a lack of masks and other personal protection equipment.

The federal bailout, urged by lobbyists, may be loaded with conflicts of interest, difficult to sort out...and unjust, even offensive, to those that really depend on financial aid to survive. But I'm  afraid those at the base of society, the workers that do live from paycheck to paycheck, shall be bypassed, lacking 'emissaries' (instead of corporate lobbyists) to make their case. And if we've learned anything about crooked Trump is that he'll favor his donors, the 'rich and powerful'...as usual (remember the tax abatement of one trillion not long ago, worthless to the average worker, and not even re-invested in the industries that did benefit?). If this governmental necessary outlay (money), with our taxes, is to assure justice and equanimity, we do need a very 'healthy' regulation and public supervision. Or do we need to be reminded we live in a capitalistic system devoid of ethics, hence, the odious inequality, fertile for selfishness and greed?"

Then the trend line has been sell, and the market falls off.  Even where it later in the day attempts a come back, Trump appearing and opening his mouth - by itself - appears to be depressing the stock market.

So how about Trump stay away from the podium, as well as Pence or any other politico within his administration (and why in the world would Ivanka even be on the dias to begin with... but I digress).

You would think that they would treat their frequent flyers well, but they have relentlessly raised the number of miles to redeem points, while simultaneously eliminating most upgrades by waiting until the last minute before a flight takes off to sell that last revenue business class seat.  At the very minimum they need to extend their frequent flyer benefits for a full year. There’s no way anyone can maintain their prior level of travel for the rest of 2020. All we see is the back of the airlines’ hand as their response for the loyalty of their best customers.

Perhaps a more highly regulated industry needs to be re-visited before handing out more bailouts. Those who remember flying in the 1960s and early 70s might think that a worthwhile idea. Commercial air travel then was a pleasure, service was excellent and dependable and probably no more expensive than it is today. In reality today the airlines are operated by Wall Street.

He reduced CDC funding and eliminated the National Security Council staff charged with identifying and protecting us from virus threats from abroad.  When quick decisive action to quarantine the country could have contained most of the threat, Trump, who like many conservatives is generally against using government to help people, did nothing.  Literally NOTHING.

Now that we are becoming victims, we should help people affected by the disease and related unemployment.  For the latter, we already have a good program - unemployment insurance.  States should review their programs to ensure persons laid off due to the virus immediately get benefits and at a reasonable level. This will also help maintain consumer demand.

We do not need new programs for businesses.  Trump already gave them a $2 trillion gift with his tax cut.  Let private enterprise take care of private companies.  Businesses impacted by the virus can borrow money or, if needed, sell more stock to get money.

2020-03-20 21:51:46,"Many readers ask “Why bailouts for large corporations?”  The answer is very simple: Because boomers concoct most government decisions. Boomers do it as lobbyists, boomers do it as top execs of large corporations and banks, boomers do it as lawmakers, and boomers do it as members of the executive branch.  I am not a boomer, I descended on this planet before them and I recognize I may be playing my second or third overtime period.  Boomers are the generation that gave us most of our ills as a society.  Boomers made “my comfort first at any price” their life motif.  And they believe that if the Boeings, Walmarts, Bank of Americas of this country get bailouts they, the boomers will soon be able to go to Mar-a-Largo type of places to play golf again, will be able to go on cruises again, and will be able again to continue to ruin the planet they will be leaving for their grandchildren and the children of their grandchildren. Solution: Clean the U.S. Senate and the White House of the current occupants (who are just a few years younger than I am) and replace ALL of them with people that do not think that we still are in the 1950s. If the large corporations close and the workers of those corporations lose their jobs and therefore their income bail out those workers not the corporation!"
2020-03-20 23:16:34,"Not a penny for the cruise industry.

Simply put, the American owners pay 1-2% US tax on billions of profits, and in return build and register their ships overseas, crew them with low wage foreign workers then use loopholes to operate in the lucrative American and European markets.  

Yes - more than a few thousand jobs do depend on these ships in the US - but cruising is a leisure activity and is not an essential or national security critical industry.  

Now it's time for the shareholders and the hedge fund owners to step up to the plate and take it out of their ""shareholder value"", not our pocketbooks."
2020-03-20 22:36:35,Of course Boeing wants $60B. Their executives see this as a get out of jail card for their poor management of the company.

It won't improve how their business is run.
2020-03-20 23:11:34,"Where will all this financial aid/bail out actually go?  Into the pockets of the fat cat ceo's, who already have been bleeding these corporations dry, or, into the actual hands of the workers?

These ceo's with their well-manicured hands out, pleading for more corporate welfare funding - what ever happened to what you've been telling individuals and the poor - pull yourselves up by your bootstraps!

Any federal assistance should go straight to the workers in the form of cash, and health care coverage.  Bypass the ceo's - they've got more than enough to live on."
2020-03-20 22:48:01,"$1.5 Trillion at this point is nowhere near enough.

The hogs feeding at the trough aside, the economic downturn currently unfolding will leave a $5 Trillion hole in the GDP.

That's the gap that needs to be plugged: $5 Trillion. I don't hear anyone discussing anything close to that magnitude."
2020-03-20 23:38:45,"Each state has a system for unemployment benefits already in place.

There is no need to create one from scratch at the federal level.

Or to send checks to everyone, especially those not in need.

The federal government should advance funds for unemployment benefits in whatever amounts are necessary as requested by each state, as loans or grants, as may be agreed by Congress and the each state governor.

Any corporate bailouts will be corrupted or misused.

The Federal Reserve has taken proper action by providing sufficient liquidity to banks and money market funds such that major corporations can access their emergency lines of credit.

No direct grants or loans need be made to large corporations.

It is normally difficult for small business owners who receive payroll from a corporation that they own to claim unemployment benefits during a downturn, unless they actually close the business for good. An exception should be made so that such owners can claim benefits and keep going on a personal level until they can re-open and hire again."
2020-03-20 23:41:12,"The most direct and most effective course of action would be to send the money to individuals who have lost their jobs. That will keep them safe and secure while simultaneously pumping money into the economy as they spend. The companies that laid them off can shut down their facilities and reopen them at a later date. 

By contrast, the organizations requesting this money well may use this opportunity to grab funds for a variety of projects unrelated to the virus. This applies to both the private and public sector. I doubt the virus has caused Boeing the sixty billion dollars it is requesting any more than the virus has caused the NYC subway system the four billion dollars it wants."

I happen to think that the 2010 bailouts saved the economy. But Meadows and his crowd, though having a point, went way too far demagoging their way into office over them. Sometimes things happen and have to be dealt with. 

And this same bunch won’t make a peep about The Deficit. What a world."
2020-03-20 23:30:23,"Seems like this would be a great time to start the United States Sovereign Wealth Fund.  These companies can sell their equity to this fund and the US becomes a major stockholder with a seat(s) on the board.  All of those shares bought back by companies, get re-issued (and then some) to our wealth fund.  The current shareholders who watched their stock price increase and the executives with their stock options, all get diluted.  Boohoo!  

The US taxpayer indirectly becomes an owner of this fund.  Assuming the companies recover, the fund makes money.  And of course the government has all the leverage it needs to ensure it gets a favorable price, much like any white knight would do.  Maybe some of the private sector would compete for the offering and then everyone wins.

Let's not just hand out money to any industry that wants it.  We did that with the Trump tax cut and look where it got us.  It's time for the government to think responsibly and not just grow our debt by trillions more with nothing in return.  These companies made their bed with the tax cut, so let the government share it with them."

Congress is correct to help small businesses and individuals in NEED! But there must be rules. The checks can’t just be sent out willy-nilly. This can’t be games as usual in DC. Once this is over American taxpayers will be footing the bill.  

The companies that pay their upper echelon obscene salaries but don’t pay the other employees a living wage, don’t deserve free aid. 

What can the rich and big business do to help Americans? 

Instead of donating to politicians, they can donate to the Treasury to help pay for the stimulus plan.

The high-muck-a-muck of business must cut their salaries and benefits and reinvest the savings back into the company. Let’s see them sacrifice like us. 

Those who recently got a tax cut must return the money to the Treasury. 

They should tell the Treasury that they want to start paying their fair share of taxes. The tax level must go back to what it was before the cut. 

The politicians with millions on hand for elections must donate them to the Treasury. The stable genius should be the 1st to do this as he’s gotten a lot of money from his rich pals.

Handing out money with no supervision is not in the public interest.  It is in the interest of the stock holders.

Their employees have fabulous benefits that we taxpayers pay.  It is time for more to come off the 1% pedestal, down a few notches to where the rest of us live.
The airlines have been shockingly greedy and made taking a plane ride a 'horrific trip to be contemplated'.  I recall in my youth, traveling alone on a plane , with plenty of legroom, ability to put the seat back, free snacks and drinks frequently offered, a hot meal  and warm companionship offered by the stewards.   Airlines turned themselves into cattle cars and ruined the concept.  I had a horrific ride with my disabled son on American a few years ago and vowed I would never fly those rotten bums again.

On the side they also shortchanged their NASA and defense contractors to where those customers are not buying what their selling either.  Boeing still managed to pry all the money in the world out of all these suckers and somehow did not manage to set anything aside for a rainy day that was predictable based on their shoddy business and manufacture processes.

Boeings executive leadership is populated a CEO with GE/private equity background and the board of directors populated with members with the private equity members.  Instead of investing in a 737 replacement, Boeing upgraded an old airframe, off-shored as much as possible, cut quality assurance, and spent 43 billion in stock buybacks over the last 7 years.  It is the employees who will suffer, not the executives who drove the company to the point where it could not survive unexpected economic shocks.  If there is a bailout, the company should be owned and run by the employees, the ones who really care about and love aviation, and not by financial engineers whose only focus is on short term driven profits."
2020-03-18 16:26:33,Boeing should keep it’s engineering and design staff fully employed during this time to do a complete redesign of the 737 Max. They should use this as an opportunity to scrap a model who’s reputation is irreparably harmed and replace it with one that can leapfrog the industry with low carbon emission capabilities.

Every bit of taxpayer money designated to help in this crisis should go to helping people (hospitals, food, supplies) and directly to taxpayers (stimulus). Nothing should be given to the greedy, reckless monopoly corporations. It will simply line the pockets of billionaires."
2020-03-18 16:39:47,"In rational terms, the Boeing debacle was more about panic than reality. The MAX was making approximately 6,000 flights a day, nearly a quarter million flights a month at the start of the crisis.

Before the merger with McDonnel Dounglas, the prevalent culture at Boeing was pride in it's history and products. Engineers, designers, execs, sales reps, etc all worked in close proximity and communicated on a regular basis, both formally and informally. McDonnel Douglas on the other hand was much more of a stereotypical profits and shareholder gratification is paramount corporation. The DC-10, the most hastily and poorly designed commercial airliner to receive certification in the post WWII era was a reflection of this. For reasons that still remain unclear, the McDonnel Douglas cultural ethos prevailed. A popular aphorism was Mickey D bought out Boeing and Boeing paid for it. The silver lining? Perhaps when this is all over, a chastened Boeing will recapture its old self."

No such bailouts should occur without concessions from industry. For example, in the airline industry, no stock buybacks and bonuses for overpaid CEOs. Instead, when times are good, airlines should be forced to improve service like giving people adequate space on a plane and limiting false price advertising by adding fees on top of fares."

Boeing incinerated $43 billion in stock buybacks since 2012 to manipulate the price of their shares, which has now collapsed because....they're almost out of money!

My what a surprise, but of course they did. It is a fact that Boeing and many other companies large and small will need bridge loans to survive and gear back up once we have gotten past the pandemic. This time around however unlike the 2017 trump-Republican tax gift there needs to be some restrictions imposed. After that tax cut Boeing increased dividends to shareholders by 20% and authorized the buy back of $20 billion in company stock. They executives also acted carelessly in the production of the 737 Max the resulted in the deaths of human lifer.

  Boeing should be required to repay the loans prior to any bonuses or dividend payouts and until the loans are extinguished. Executive base salaries shall be frozen with no bonuses or extra perks. Boeing cannot buy back any of its stock so long as the loans are in place. And finally Boeing must stop fighting the efforts of the FAA to clean up its act on the 737 Max and accept responsibility."
2020-03-18 17:18:24,"Really? I’m not getting the joke.

The airlines, airline manufacturers, cruise lines, hotels and convention centers and the list goes on. All want a bail-out after showing record profits for over a decade, increasingly higher salaries, bonuses and stock options for executives, huge buy-backs of stock with little going to its workers, and decreasing customer service and care?

Despite all the huge profits they now want money from the American taxpayer? Some want a mix of “ free money” and loans. Others just want the “ too big to fail “ approach.

American taxpayers are fed up. All the “ too little-will fail “ folks who pay their taxes, make good financial decisions for their families, and have little in savings.

Enough is enough. Give these large entities money...in dollars leant with the interest most of us pay. Make sure they follow good financial practices going forward, limited executive pay, no stock buy-backs. AND make them pay their fair share of taxes like the rest of us. No exceptions.

I’m happy to pay higher taxes to make sure we have a stronger social safety net, to provide assistance to citizens out of work, and to ensure that people regain jobs...perhaps repairing our horrendous infrastructure.

But I’m not willing to bail out corporations who have made bad financial decisions but benefit their stockholders to the exclusion of their workers, clients, and community.

This time they need to show some “ corporate responsibility. “ No free money but loans."

People declare Bernie Sanders to be an extremist, but his idea of having employee representation on the board is not far fetched. Germany has a powerful, successful economy and consider the example of Porsche who gave all their German employees, factory workers to managers alike, a $10,000 bonus in spring 2019 for an exceptional 2018. Now the company will face layoffs but unions will be cooperative as it works both ways.

The results have been tragic and they should not be allowed to put this plane back in service."
2020-03-18 17:34:42,"Maybe Boeing should claw back the huge cash bonuses for the recent couple of CEOs who steered the company onto the 737MAX reef. The last guy to parachute out was paid $60 million just to leave, in addition to his huge salary and previous bonuses and stock, etc. The guy before him, who was in charge with this mess got started, made off with tens of millions in bonuses also. If you or I made off with $100, much less tens of millions of dollars, we'd be arrested and hauled into court. 

Interesting how Corporate America wants all the benefits of tax breaks and government contracts, but the minute the economy goes rocky they show up with their hands out. Not just Boeing, but defense contractors generally, the airlines, cruise companies, Goldman Sachs, Citi, and the rest. They just got the largest tax break in history, and now they want more.

What are the world's airlines going to do with more planes when fleets are grounded and a number of companies, including some very large ones like Lufthansa and Air France-KLM will almost certainly go bust, government support or not? Meanwhile, people coming off domestic flights are testing positive for coronavirus. How long before flight attendants refuse to fly & remaining customers dwindle away?

The rot started long before that- around late 1970s. Destruction of US society, politics, industrial competitiveness, science and tech- all took nosedive.

Any person surely has the freedom to deny science, truth, and reality; but he has absolutely no freedom to evade its consequences.

Republican leadership led by highly religious and superstitious Ronald Reagan promoted that rot around 1976, even though both the parties (Dems led by ""progressive"" Jimmy Carter) embraced religious (Christian/evangelical) fundamentalism and racism linked to it.

Gradually education (mainly STEM & research), politics, economic policies, globalization of trade - almost every aspect of American society and economy were ultimately affected. Corporate governance deteriorated and crony capitalism flourished.

Our ability to create wealth declined significantly while distribution of that wealth was worse affected. Gradually wealth creation was replaced by wealth management. Finance and management (MBA guys) seized companies and gradually destroyed American industrial competitiveness. 

But past glories and financial might suppressed most of the consequences from general public view. In the meantime the pressure was building within. Now it's payback time. First Trump presidency and now Coronavirus exposed the rot to general public."

2020-03-18 18:14:03,"Boeing is a fine example for what is wrong with a large slice of the US brand of capitalism.  Short-term opportunistic thinking has replaced the wisdom of re-investing in the business of corporations under the mantle of maximizing shareholder value.  Privately led companies dare not do business that way.  Unrelenting, and often unwise, cost cutting and funneling of profits into share buy backs are leaving Boeing (and many other corporations) cash strapped during emergencies.  They all hate government regulations.  As soon as the s hits the fan they call on government (us taxpayers) to help.  Profits are sheltered from taxes and flow into the pockets of individuals.  The public is asked to pay for the losses.  What kind of capitalism is this??"

2020-03-18 18:23:56,"Readers here seem to hate the idea of any aid to companies. But they're missing two critical elements of this.

1. Their problems are exogenous, meaning that they come from the outside. That was why the US bailed out GM. Gave it loans. All of which were paid back. If GM's was a problem they made, then you would let them go under. 

2. You want the economy to recover as quickly as possible. So you want these companies in place to be able to re-start as smoothly as possible. That way people get their jobs back. Which seems to be the goal of folks. 

To paraphrase Bernie: People, through no fault of their own are losing their livelihoods and need to be ""made whole"". 

That's true for companies too: through no fault of their own, are going out of business, and need to be made whole.

The big difference: companies employ people. Making them whole, makes their employees whole. Before this mess started, that was 96.5% of the working age population."

How much do they pay the board that oversaw the entire 737 debacle? How much does the C-Suite get comp'd in salary, bonuses and stock? Bailout Boeing and they're still going to lay people off.

This worker and family support must come before any subsidies to large corporations who have already benefited from large tax cuts that were used for stock buybacks.

Even more important than what, exactly, we want to insure against (a quintessential political question) - the first question is how to pay for universal coverage.

First, make support for medical facilities the most top priority. Free medical care and testing, bonuses for health care workers. No profiteering by health insurance companies, whose boundless rapacity got our medical system into this ravaged state in the first place.

It seems like the most they're willing to do for such people is a possible grace period for non-payment of rent. What happens when the time comes to pay several months of it at once? Do the senators who dumped all that stock have some hot tips on how their constituents can turn $600 into $6000?"

Convert Trump properties to emergency hospitals now!! Send Americans a minimum of $3500 each now and again in the fall.  Do not bail out oil companies who's CEO salaries are grotesque and who have gouged the public for decades. We bailed out the banks already in 2008 as they snatched away peoples' homes.

A tax cut strategy at this time is completely irresponsible and unacceptable. Offer loans, but these must have conditions as Schumer stated yesterday: no buybacks, no layoffs.

The fact that they still want to sneak in tax breaks, limit health care, etc. etc. borders on the criminal.

Think how many service workers, like at McDonald's , are old.  Many were supplementing their Soc Sec income.  They will be laid off.  

For many people on Social Security life becomes a gradual withering away, not just in health but in everything. 
If things break, they don't get fixed.  My heating unit has been broken 2 years.  My shower broke and I now use a garden hose clamped onto the tub spigot.  Etc.  

I am not seeking sympathy.  I am just saying that for me, an influx of cash would be used to repair some of those things and would go directly back into the economy.  

So come on, NYT.  It is the elderly who are most likely to die; likely to be the first laid off;  and who face the greatest risks in everything we do, like buying groceries.

2020-03-20 16:30:19,"There are two reasons I think the direct payments should be made universal rather than means tested.  

First, creating a situation where some people can rightfully be denied payment makes it much more likely that people will wrongfully be denied payment.  To the degree that  these payments are intended to alleviate the economic suffering of individual Americans, it is much better to err on the side of giving people too much than on the side of giving people too little.

Second, one of the goals of the payments is to increase consumer spending to help prevent an economic downturn.  From that perspective, it doesn't really matter if the people receiving the money don't need it.  It's true that people who do need the money are more likely to spend it (on things they need, like food and housing), but people who don't need extra money are still likely to do something with it.

It's not politically popular to give rich people extra money.  But there are reasons proponents of universal basic income want to do it anyway.  

I'd also like to say that if the government is going to spend a trillion dollars to bolster the economy they really ought to spend money paying for the uninsured and underinsured to get treatment for the virus if they need it.  It's very important right now that sick people seek treatment, and they're less likely to if they think they'll end up with thousands of dollars of medical debt."

Who cares about tax cuts?  People who pay taxes, of course.  To Republicans, those not affluent enough to pay taxes just don’t count.  Perhaps they are right, because anyone who is not paying taxes is not among their natural constituencies.

Until election time rolls around and they need all the votes they can accumulate, not only those of the rich who benefit from their policies.  That’s when they drag out the big guns: racism, xenophobia, taxes, religion and its stepchild abortion, and, of course, big guns.

Now we face a national emergency as a result of the pandemic and a key Republican response is - tax cuts. Of course.

Perhaps Chuck Schumer will introduce legislation to change the name of the coronavirus to the communist virus.

2020-03-20 16:07:30,Any corporate bailouts should be paid for in the number of shares given to the Government equal to the value of the number of shares previously bought back. Big corporate stock buybacks are nothing more than the destructive hoarding of wealth for the benefits of the executive and super rich!
2020-03-20 16:06:01,The Congress was too busy unloading their stock for the last month to work on something like this as the article in today's Times points out.  I wonder how many Congress critters sold short as well.  We will never find out given the way Congress protects itself. Americans should demand that we get money out of politics.  Unfortunately the candidate who espoused that has been relegated to the trashbin of history.  Americans will get the government and the outcome they vote for and deserve.  When I think of the Senators to include Feinstein no less who dumped their stock after the intelligence briefings in January and I compare it to the nurses and doctors putting their lives on the line treating this  epidemic I feel sick.
2020-03-20 16:56:17,"As usual, Republicans and some Democrats are willing to do more to help the rich than the poor.
Why do large corporations need money now when they are laying off workers? How do we know that the corporations will not use the money to buy back shares?
More money in the pockets of the rich will go to their buying stocks as the prices are tanking.
Democrats should have the backbone to refuse to sign on a bill that short changes the ordinary Americans.
If the Democrats cannot be relied on to do even this minimum, we Democratic voters should just stay home in November."

This is, as usual, slanted to the advantaged. Folks like me, with incomes of $85K, don't need this $1200. It's a Republican/Trump effort directed at the 2020 election. Meaningful assistance would offer food stamps, rent coverage, medical expenses...,etc., in accordance with need."

2020-03-20 17:20:42,This is class genocide. Hundreds of thousands of low income Americans who through no fault of their own are being excluded from any stimulus. Their crime? Being too poor to be required to file taxes in 2018.
2020-03-20 17:54:13,"Trump's idea for the government to take equity stakes in companies to form a sovereign wealth fund is a good one. 

Rather than loans that the private market would not make, taking an equity stake, or providing secured convertible debt, pays taxpayers for the risk they are assuming.

Funding such equity or secured covertible debt stakes with low interest rate long-term Treasuries would create value to the US Treasury over time, stabilize capital markets, and reduce layoffs.

It is time for the nation to do what over governments have long done and use the higher growth sovereign wealth funds to secure the nations long-term obligations to Social Security, Medicare and infrastructure rebuildinging.

The timing couldn't be better.

The government does not need to vote the shares, but rather hold broad market indices through ETFs."
2020-03-20 18:01:18,"With all the Americans at risk of death from covid 19, especially seniors and those with Pre-existing conditions, and the government handeling over an emergency relief package, the old 2008 arguments over “shovel ready” programs springs to mind."
2020-03-20 18:13:39,"Trump says it isn't the Federal Government's role to be buying and (fairly?) distributing things in a time of national emergency?

This is EXACTLY why he's unfit and never was fit, for the job and offers no leadership.

For members of his cabinet and the congress to be lobbying for their own personal areas of gain is not only nauseating but unethical.

The only problem is that the voters are very short sighted and won't remember this avaricious behavior when it comes time to vote."
2020-03-20 18:15:12,"The small businesses AND the workers are those that need to get cash as soon as possible! Period!

Corporations have plenty of cash reserves to get them through this pandemic and should put both their hands back in their pockets! It is well known and documented just what they did with both the 2017 tax cuts and the bailouts provided during the Great Recession. Corporations NO!!!"
2020-03-20 18:11:57,"For crying out loud. One of the reasons the country is in economic crisis is because of the, 'no-thank you very much', trump republican Tax overhaul that gave millions to corporations and wealthy people and a pittance to the rest of us.

Now we are looking at another gift from the republicans who have ""...unveiled a package that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to big corporations...large corporate tax cuts and...limits on a paid-leave program enacted this week to respond to the crisis.""

At the same time, Democrats are pressing for a more ""...generous paid-leave benefit and targeting help to workers and families rather than large corporations.""

Don't listen to the spin. The Democrats have a plan to help the country and the republicans are spooning out the same old nonsense."

2020-03-20 18:40:33,"When I walk down the street and see all the stores and eateries are dark and closed, my thoughts are with people who used to work there just few days ago.
They are the ones who need extra help, not us who are still working and collecting a paycheck.
In this uncertain time being scared and cautious is one thing, being scared and unemployed is quite another thing.
Please let's hope their unemployment benefit would be meaningful enough that they feel they are not sitting out in the cold alone."
2020-03-20 22:04:00,Limiting buybacks does nothing; corporations can give to shareholders by increased dividends instead. What could work is to tie any buybacks (that help execs with stocks & options) to increases or bonuses for employees. E.g. for every million spent on buybacks another million (or a preset fraction of it) be divided EQUALLY as bonus among all employees. Same for dividends.
2020-03-20 19:23:05,"As usual the GOP are going to cut corporate taxes and undercut the rest of the package just like they did in 2009/2010.

It is so predictable. If we replaced them with automatons, we would get the same results."
2020-03-20 19:10:37,"A corporate tax cut is pointless as it will stimulate nothing. Instead take that money and spend it on capital projects like highways and other infrastructure. A recession is cause by lack of demand, so the obvious action is to stimulate demand. Money directly to consumers will do that."
2020-03-20 21:59:24,Trump has been talking up a new tax cut for a while.  They were not getting  much traction  but now they have their opening.  If there's one thing I know about tax cuts it's  that they are virtually impossible to take back.  Use some other kind of relief for companies that need it.
2020-03-20 19:32:52,"More corporate tax cuts? Really?

I have news for them. Corporate tax cuts won't do any good when there is minimal income to be taxed.

There is literally no challenge that Republicans won't answer with ""corporate tax cuts"" as the solution."

No legal protection for the ER doctor who turns away a patient to save a bed for coronavirus.

If you are uninsured and have to go to the hospital, your life savings will be drained in a day.

This bill isn't about helping anyone who needs help.  It's about using the crisis to build political support.

It's sad this story is hidden.  The text of the law is hidden, it's reported only late on a weekend, and the story itself isn't featured at all.  

Our attention is clearly elsewhere, entranced by the shadows on the wall of the cave."
2020-03-20 21:50:16,"If they wanted to help senior citizens they might consider simply having the IRS wave the annual compulsory  withdrawal of a percent of IRA's for those over 70.

With that set of ""alternative facts"" then corporations should get the same relief that people do.  People can't go to Wall Street or the Fed and raise funds through loans and stock purchases.  

Anyone guessing how much Uday and Qusay Trump will net out of this?"
2020-03-20 22:19:46,"What the trump regime is doing to help big corporations is appalling. Why give money to companies that don't even pay taxes AND get tax breaks? Did they give any of that money, you know trickle down, to their employees? NO. they kept it all at the top. Now they want to use their employee's money to assist them again in their own failings. They should've put money aside for things like this but they gave themselves bonus and bigger pay checks. Why is socialism good to trumpers when it used to help people that don't need it but to fuel their greed which is why we're in this predicament in the first place. It's all karmic. Stealing from the poor to give to the rich is karmic. Thank you Democrats for taking a stand for the average American who can't afford (in every sense) this pandemic. Is our credit going to be ruined like it was during the last recession while banks were getting bailed out? Let big business fend for themselves like we did in 2008."
2020-03-20 21:19:40,"Between the reporters and most of the reader posts I have zero faith in recovery for anyone with under a million in assets.

What we will get is little relief, Again we will stand jaws slack as the event is turned into another handout to the rich paid for by hourly workers while Amazon pays nothing. How about we just tax the billionaires 99%?

Tax cuts for the wealthy, is nothing more than insanity, greed, and a general attitude of eat the poor.

While you were not looking we have turned into a banana republic with a big fat banana running the show."
2020-03-20 20:30:00,"Once again, Republicans try to help the rich and not the poor.  People who are living paycheck to paycheck need help. Those making far more do not.  Apparently they have no shame at all."
2020-03-20 22:47:30,"You can count on Republicans to save corporations first.  Workers aren't really human to them.  The sources of their power and prestige are all that matter.

2020-03-21 00:16:52,"The arbitrary cut-off of $99K for individuals and $198K for married couples is too low. I may not register the same kind of need as someone else based on my 2018 taxes, but who is to say what the future holds in these uncertain times? My husband and I make a comfortable living (just at the threshold where we won't receive any stimulus at all), but we don't make enough to have investments, much less a ""portfolio."" It's us and our little savings account. I don't have children, so I have always paid more taxes than other people, and I have never received the same level of benefits. I feel downright resentful. I think the stimulus needs to be universal, or the threshold for phasing it out needs to be much higher--say $1 million for a married couple."
2020-03-20 23:58:23,"Money flows up hill. This money shower in the making will further enrich the already rich, like it did after the GFC, further aggravating the already dangerous income inequality in the US. This proposed injection of liquidity needs to be drained off at the top by a higher marginal rate of income tax, and higher corporation taxes for companies still profitable."
2020-03-20 22:44:30,"Trump’ brilliant reason against the government stepping in to help the health care system with shortages of everything needed to deal with the virus is:“You know, we’re not a shipping clerk,” and the governors “are supposed to be doing it.” What?

All the talk of bailing out the airline industry and the rest of the corrupt corporate raiders we continue to vote for should make us get off our couches and march on Washington to throw them out. But thanks to the Covid-19 virus and the Trump Effect the next election may not happen and the millions of Americans in its path have no say anymore.

Juxtaposing his earlier statements (on almost anything, but especially COVID-19) with his later proclamations shows just how clueless and uninformed he really is."
2020-03-17 22:24:07,Or he is telling the truth. HE knew it was a pandemic when he told everyone it was not and they should go about their daily lives.  In which case he just confessed to mass murder.
2020-03-17 22:27:31,"If Trump always knew it would be a pandemic, why didn't he instantly rehire the NSC pandemic response team that he and Bolton had disbanded? After all, at a press conference on Feb 26, he said the reason he did it is because he didn't like people on the payroll who were ""doing nothing,"" and ""I can always get them back when I need them."" It sure seems like he could have used them, oh, about 6 or 8 weeks ago... of course, back then he was using words like ""hoax"" to describe what he ""knew would be a pandemic."""
2020-03-17 22:28:54,"This is scary. A leader who can't admit he's wrong isn't a leader, rather, they're a follower. This is not someone this country can trust to pull us through the pandemic of a lifetime."

2020-03-17 22:25:12,"And this surprises whom? He doesn't listen to anyone with a brain- why would he listen to himself? Why would anyone assume he remembers what comes out of his mouth? He isn't going to read it- he doesn't read anything. 

Resident Trump is completely insulated from literally everything from Pence the Pious right on down to the kitchen staff at 1600. 

I can't wait until the day when we don't pay for his meals, flights, rallies, golf, and mistakes."
2020-03-17 22:30:53,"This most recent self-contradiction follows a pattern. Either he's in a constant state of flipping the switch on what he thinks will please his base, or he can no longer remember or comprehend what he said previously.

In the first instance he's a lying and deliberately deceitful man unfit to occupy the Presidency.

In the second instance he's mentally unstable and unfit to occupy the Presidency."

2020-03-17 22:28:12,This is the usual Trumpian propaganda -- repeat lies until people can no longer see the truth. There was a government in the 1930s and 1940s that made heavy use of this strategy. He seems to take most of his inspiration from that time -- propelled by his rabid backers.
2020-03-17 22:30:35,"The way Trump's brain functions, and it is not a normal brain, he absolutely believes that what he just said is true. He's not trying to pull a fast one. His mind tells him that whatever pops into his head now is the truth. And the reason he convinces so many people is that his brain allows him to say these things with total conviction. If he was just lying, that would be bad enough. But his reality is beyond that. It's frightening."

The problem, of course, is that when you have a legion of zombies who have surrendered all independent thought to a pathological liar, nothing really changes no matter how absurd his lies become--and this particular lie is his new standard for absurdity.

What I want to know is when are reporters going to band together and call him on it in real time? 

I just hope that the Democrats run endless ads about his saying this and ""I don't take responsibility at all,"" and all the other things he's said about this health crisis (as stated in this article).

On March 9th., in a tweet, he accused the ""fake news media and Democrats"" of trying to ""inflame the corona-virus.""  

He was more concerned about the stock market and his image than the spread of the virus.  At this point, he still hasn't shown any empathy nor compassion for the victims.  It's all about his monstrous ego and how he will be perceived as a candidate."
2020-03-17 22:38:11,So Trump now admits that he has known for weeks that this would be a pandemic.  I had thought that his repeated statements the problem was under control and his failure to get testing done and take other action to prevent the spread of Covid-19 the way Singapore and Hong Kong did showed how incompetent he is. I guess he’s now admitting that he intentionally  lied to us and put us into the public health and economic crisis we find ourselves. Wow.

Frankly I don’t buy the “unprecedented circumstances” put forth by public and health officials, reflecting nothing less than the unconscionable level responsibility they were charged with yet now seem to unaccountable for.  Sub-par healthcare at twice the cost of any other first world country.  US life expectancy is now 35th in the world."
2020-03-17 22:40:03,"He’s lying. But if he did know it was a pandemic, and did nothing about it, then he is guilty of manslaughter and should be removed from office."
2020-03-17 22:58:44,"Trump had no idea it was a pandemic. He denied it was even an issue, then tried to control the numbers by endangering people, leaving them in a corona petri dish cruise ship. Or crushed them together for hours in airports, spreading the disease further. 

The lack of testing was by design. He simply figured, if we don’t test it, who will know? We'll just say its the flu.

The problem is, the states and medical community  got out ahead of him. Once they started shutting stuff down, the layoffs were inevitable, as was the recession. The market had also gotten ahead of him and priced that in.  

Despite trying to talk up bailouts and talk up the market, no one was buying his propaganda. The reality had set in even for his nitwit cabinet. You could see the life drain out of Trump when he finally realized he couldn’t deny the recession. He looked morose. 

And that lasted about a day. 

The Fed was also ahead of him, acting to avoid a credit crunch and financial crisis. But it’s not enough. Even Mnuchin knew this. 

There was but one thing left to do: lie, and buy your re-election - we witnessed it today. Remember how deficits mattered to Republicans during the crisis that Bush left on Obama’s doorstep? Well, they don’t now. We’ll double  the deficit. And if morale hasn’t improved, will load it up some more. 

There is no limit to what this man will do to avoid responsibility for his failures.  It’s all about another grift, this time, for four more years of the Presidency."
2020-03-17 23:04:15,"Trump's ""perfect"" Oval Office speech was six days ago.
But He and his supporters are all about re-writing history.
Not the future; the past."
2020-03-17 22:53:11,"The thing is, he and his team care more about optics and sitting in a room for hours, to come up with ways of spinning the issue of the day, to whatever they believe shows dear leader in the best light, than they do about actually trying to save lives.  If Trump has gotten out in front of this thing and lead from day one, offering both the sober truth and reassurance that the federal government is doing everything in their power to help Americans, he would have breezed to reelection.  If Rudy Giuiliani--forget today's Rudy--had been eligible for the third term that his successor enjoyed in NYC,, he would have won in a landslide--because, yeah, he really did step in and lead after 9/11."
2020-03-17 22:49:41,"It’s not over...this very stable genius will probably also discover cure for covid-19...just watching him last week at the lab, he was on the cusp of a cure, Stay tuned."
2020-03-17 22:42:35,"A Federally funded think tank needs to be formed now. Comprised of leaders in all areas of public health, including economists, this task force will examine data collected throughout this pandemic and follow through for as long as necessary to analyze and learn from this experience. We need to establish a uniformed and orderly response, based upon the best science available, to the next pandemic. We need to have protocols established ready to be implemented by the Federal Government to prevent a recurrence of hoarding. We need to re-think the purpose of allowing the stock market to remain open during pandemics and national crises. Our founding fathers envisioned this role of our Federal Government and its role during a crisis, as seen with a pandemic. And with this comes the responsibility to use science to learn from the Corona wake up call to know what needs to be done when the next pandemic occurs. It will. Observing the response to date during this pandemic, I shudder to think how our nation will fair if the next pandemic has a mortality of 30%.
During times of pandemic the news media need to report on those countries and regions e.g. Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, that learned from the 2003 SARS virus and who have been successful in addressing this pandemic. The public is then educated what it takes, and importantly the efficacy, to effectively address a pandemic."
2020-03-17 22:40:38,"It's astonishing that anyone with an ounce of respect or love for our country would not step aside and let the experts do their job.  Trump cannot do that, and we will all pay the price."
2020-03-17 22:38:50,"The result of Mr. Trump's lack of concern for finding out the actual facts and taking action: Many weeks into the pandemic, still no widespread testing available in USA - a national disgrace with major impact on lives and livelihoods.  South Korea took it seriously and is testing more people in a day than we have done in half a month; they now have a measure of control over spread of covid-19.  Responsibility starts at the top, and Mr. Trump is ultimately responsible for governmental decisions (or lack thereof) that affect the whole country.  If he won't take or doesn't want that responsibility, he should resign."

2020-03-17 22:38:47,Again thanks to all 63 million voters who did this.  And the many more who continue to support it today.  The man understands the dynamic.  That's why he keeps lying and saying absurd things.  He has a very big audience.
2020-03-17 23:04:31,"Donald J. Trump has not changed one iota since his father began bailing him out of failed business deals. Then he moved on to Deutsche Bank and managed to convince the only bank that would lend him money to loan him more  on which he defaulted. Then when his Atlantic City  properties were going under he convinced salesmen to hawk bonds for him and then stiffed them for the money.  I just finished reading Dark Towers by David Enrich and all through the book I kept saying he has not changed one bit.  I believe his so-called ""charisma"" has worn dangerously thin. He should resign!"
2020-03-17 22:43:41,"Trump is already trying to take credit for the idea of giving each adult American 1,000 dollars. Mitt Romney brought this up days ago and suddenly it's Trump's idea. Trump would never think of this. He's the one who wanted to take 700.000 people off of SNAP in the middle of an epidemic, and he's the one who wanted to pay for coronavirus testing by stopping aid to  help pay heating bills for the elderly poor."
2020-03-17 22:47:10,"IF he knew it was going to be a pandemic, why didnt he tell the rest of us?
Why didnt he do everything he could to keep us safe?
WHY did he lie about it?
He was either lying then or, more likely, is lying now.
How is this behavior acceptable to anyone?
I too hope that the Democrats run endless ads about his saying this and ""I don't take responsibility at all"". He is writing his own funeral....if only the Ds have the videotape. Bloomberg had the best people when it came to punishingly effective ads against trump."
2020-03-17 22:51:56,That's even worse. He knew it was a pandemic and did nothing to stop its spread. That makes him culpable for the result.
2020-03-17 22:52:02,Really?  I bet he couldn’t spell the word!
2020-03-17 23:02:32,Trump’s blatant lies show that he is well on the way to becoming a mad dictator.

2020-03-17 22:46:17,"I would like the president to know that he has reached such a point of incomprehensible verbiage that I no longer listen to him on television or radio, or read his words In the newspaper. I switch channels, fast forward, or turn the page. I am ignoring every word he says about COVID-19. I turn solely to my state department of public health and local public health department for advice. With all due respect, Mr. President, I ignore you because I want to survive. I think many people across the country feel the same way.￼￼"
2020-03-17 23:01:03,"Despite months of lead time, Trump’s inaction and denial of reality has caused people to get sick and die. Yet Trump says, “I don’t take any responsibility at all” for what’s happening in the US and for his administration’s unforgivably slow response.

Why even bothering having a president at all?? What is the point of having a president who himself says that he doesn’t have any responsibility? Can he please just disappear? Just think how many lives could have been saved!"
2020-03-17 22:40:02,"This cash payment scam is so telling. And the fact McConnell has stated they're going to move at ""warp"" speed?  Since when do they move at warp speed to help Americans?  When they stand to win an election by buying votes for $1,000 each, that's when.  They want to do it NOW because, well, doing it in November would be so obvious.  And we wouldn't want that, now would we? Trump is thrilled, just like every other politician in an election year, that we now have a virus from which he can save the planet. ""we have it totally under control""...yes, indeed you do.  Massive, massive control.  When people are terrified, then you hang a $1,000 carrot in front of them, you've pretty much guaranteed control over every move they make. Heck, people are forgetting he described this as a hoax, and now insists he knew it would be serious all along. Here, here's 1,000 bucks to forget I said any of it.  Real justice will come when I get my $1,000 and he's still voted out."
2020-03-17 22:43:04,"If he knew, why didn't he act sooner?"
2020-03-17 23:01:12,"So he was lying, either then or now.  Which is it?"
2020-03-17 23:06:00,"Boy, do I feel like a dolt. I just put it together. When Trump talked to Mike Bloomberg immediately following his election, he told Mike that “No one is smarter than I am.”  So of course, if he didn’t know something, like that healthcare is complicated, or that COVID-19 could become pandemic, nobody else could possibly have known. 
Now those assertions that “nobody knew” make more sense."
2020-03-17 22:52:30,"If that gets you going, imagine how Trump will spin the Feds decision to give $1000 to each citizen during the virus? That will play huge with his base. 

During this quarantine, that has now affected sports, movie theaters, concerts, you name it - those big-time stars must be telling every fan across the nation that they need to vote this sucker out. They have the name,the time and the money. If you can't perform live, perform by getting people to the ballot box."
2020-03-17 22:55:18,Trump is such an embarassment.  It is obvious to everyone that he just makes things up as he goes along.
2020-03-17 22:49:57,Does he think that people don't have memories or that videotape does not exist???
2020-03-17 23:05:39,As I read this “story” I’m reminded of the star struck obsessed fan  predator who tracks and maps out on their bedroom wall every step that star takes every day with push pins and string.  This trivial minute level of scrutiny is disturbing.

He's on record as basically saying the opposite, many times, and in many ways leading up to this sudden pronouncement.

2020-03-17 22:43:13,"It's so sad that despite a pattern of misleading the public, ignoring science, and taking no accountability for anything, 40% of the public continues to believe and support Trump. His actions, whether it be removing the NSC Pamdemic unit, saying this is a hoax, or even saying he is doing a great job and he has to fight the ""fake"" NY Times reflect the fact that this man is and never was qualified to lead anything of consequence. 

Unfortunately like everything he touches, Trump burns everything to the ground and always seems to squirm away. Consequently, hIs take away is ""it's not my problem"".  

I truly hope that this is the nail in the coffin to eviscerate the Republican party and stop them from pushing all of these lunatics into office. It is so sad that it will take hurting the lives of thousands, if not milions--for a chance of this to happen. That's the only way to end this Idiocracy.

2020-03-17 22:50:28,"To me, in this matter, Trump is like a DWI repeat offender who has once again consciously chosen to drive while impaired.  He dwells in a world in which no one ever has, and no one will now, take away his keys, flatten his tires, remove his distributor cap, stop him.  And We-the-People, ALL of us, regardless of any and all personal identifiers, have been tied up, pushed out into the road, and thrown down as he drives recklessly, at breakneck speed, right into us, over us, and on down the road. His choices and the consequences of his choices are criminal and yet he will walk away unscathed and scott-free. How can this continue to be?"

To understand their behavior you need to understand the patterns in their actions and comments.  Trump's behavior is no different.  His pattern is well established. In the moment he will say what makes him look good or is a positive personal spin.  Or,  he will deflect blame to others, attack a perceived opponent or critic.  He knows that no one in the media will challenge him, or correct his erroneous statements or flat-out lies in real-time.  Then it is over, and he repeats the cycle in the next interview or the next day.  But, not before he has tweeted out his defense or attack, that will be reprinted verbatim by reporters like Haberman, Rogers and Peter Baker at the NY Times.  After 3-Plus years, members of the media have still not figured out how to cover this man-child in the White House.   And So Goes!"

Any other President who uttered such words would be out of office and in solitary confinement."
2020-03-17 22:59:37,"Was there any doubt that Trump would anoint himself the omniscient and omnipotent expert in all things medically related? He is incapable of admitting that he is ever wrong.  And the sad truth is that his profound self-deception and egomania trigger his belief in his own words.  He truly believes the lies that he speaks. And his followers will declare him the hero of this debacle which could have been assuaged if not fully contained.  They may lose their jobs or get temporarily laid off; God forbid, they or their loved ones may become infected with the coronavirus with possible deaths to follow.  THIS is this man's frightful power.  But we must not forget.  We can not allow a person of his ilk to remain in the highest office of the land.

But really, at this moment, and considering the likely consequences of not just his recent failure to act in a crisis, but his persistent aggressive discouragement of right action in response to this unprecedented crisis, I think that this sort of a brazen lie really deserves a lot of media attention.

We are in a crisis unprecedented perhaps in history, and our chief executive helplessly shows himself, yet again, to be a pathological liar and narcissist.  That's news fit to print."

The world's been laughing at us for 3+ years now; and now, given the miserable, ineptitude demonstrated by President 'Embarrassment' over Corona, even the most partisan among us could have nothing but tears to shed for those who continue to suffer.

There's nothing laughable, however, about how this President's ignorance, masked in grand, vile hubris , is demonstrated daily, most recently with his lame attempt to rewrite so clear a record of wrong-headed mismanagement through continued lies.

Fortunately, he seems to be able to continue to make the time, in the midst of this nightmare, to tweet and retweet blame through smoke, rather than proactively lead.  It's like throwing a roll of paper towels to victims of a hurricane.  Remember ?  I do !  

The only way this nation will recover fully is to keep the truth alive rather than allowing a serial megalomaniac to rewrite history.  

And, we haven't even seen the worst of Corona..."

They add no value to the discussions we are having here and now. We want to know what is happening today, what will happen tomorrow, and do not care a lot about what happened over ten years ago. When the book is finally closed on this emergency, then t will be time enough to make comparisons.

Next, we eliminate from the contributions of all the Task Force members the false and sycophantic references to the ""President's Leadership"". Yes, I know that those are compulsory if they want to keep their jobs, but at some point integrity should also be a consideration.

But what of Republican voters, among whom, and no matter what, Trump's approval rating hovers around 47%.  They'll vote for him, for sure.

It's possible Democratic voters will unite. But what of the almost 50% of eligible Americans who do not vote?  I've made tens of thousands of phone calls and knocked on thousands of doors, and thought I'd heard it all - and then I hear a new explanation. 

Trump was elected by around 25% of the electorate. Perhaps that should trouble us almost as much as that he was elected at all."
2020-03-17 23:43:42,"He can't have it both ways.

""Right now virtually every state in America is in suppression mode, but suppression has no chance of succeeding unless cases are identified. With the United States having tested only about 40,000 of its nearly 330 million people — the worst record in the developed world — we are struggling to catch up, which will take weeks, all while the virus spreads, possibly so widely that it becomes entrenched and impossible to suppress.""

Trump will, with troubling conviction, deny something he previously affirmed; and Pence will, with equally troubling conviction, lavish praise on Trump’s questionable accomplishments. Almost as troubling is the nervous laughter and mindless head-nodding of others who may, to their regret, share the same stage. At least those with solid professional credentials can later write their “inside baseball” books to justify their compliance. “We were the only adults in the room, we needed to right the ship, provide the guardrails, etc.” I suppose some of these retrospective explanations will pass muster. We shall see."
2020-03-17 23:29:15,"Trump stopped travel from China on January 30th. That was entirely unprecedented at the time. A month later, Biden and Sanders were still saying that that was wrong, and that they wouldn't have done it, for the sake of political correctness... 

A month of planes from China, 600 travelers a day, 20,000 total, with say 1000 infected starting 1000 clusters, way before social distancing, that would have put the US in a scaled Italy situation, 150,000 infected (instead of 5,000), 10,000 dead already (instead of 200).

People here say Trump was a disaster, but forget to mention that miraculously we have 1/20 the rate of infection of Western Europe or Asia. It's not a miracle, but due to the timely action of Trump.

Also, people here wish that a Democratic president was in charge, without mentioning that his/her political correctness would have brought us twenty times more infections and more deaths.

Actions speak louder than words, and Trump's unprecedented actions, on China and Europe, saved a huge amount of lives and suffering.

All the people watching the news can see that he has assembled an excellent epidemics leadership specialist team who have his full support.

By the way, China reciprocated to our political correctness by accusing the American Army of planting the virus in the Wuhan wet market..."

Trump deserves great criticism for his inept handling, or non-handling, of the coronavirus, but he HAS been much more peaceful than his opponent in 2016, Hillary Clinton, would have been. He proposed taking us out of Afghanistan, for example (and ask yourself: When we attacked Afghanistan in 2001, did you think we'd still be there in 2020?), and has resisted multiple efforts to get us into the Syrian War. HRC, in stark contrast, advocated a ""no-fly zone"" over all of Syria; given that the only planes then flying were Russian, what do you suppose would have been the result of that?

HRC opposed the Vietnam War, but that was 50 years ago. Since then, she's become a war-monger -- siding with George W. Bush, for example, in the US invasion of Iraq. 

Trump has very many faults, but he IS more peaceful than HRC would have been."

30 million uninsured became pandemic's hidden weapon of procreation and vector of attack. Same for 12 million illegal immigrants who are afraid to seek help. 

The inadequacy of our healthcare. geared toward profitable chronic diseases, but not up to the task for a pandemic.

The population where 40% have less than $400 in a bank and are one disaster away from being homeless or hungry. And that disaster arrived to all at once. 

The federal government starved of funds and talent for so many decades that literally no one seems able to stand up to the challenge at hand.

The problem is, Fox will reinvent this to make him look like the stable genius that he isn't. Hannity said that Trump's decision to stop travel to China the single biggest decision in history. I'm pretty sure Winston Churchill and FDR made a few important decisions along the way - and possibly our founding fathers. 
I think what Trump really means, is that he just learned what the word ""pandemic"" means. Judging from his usual grandiose speeches, the man can't handle a word with more than one syllable. And if in fact he thought it was a pandemic, then shame on him. And the bigger shame is that his base won't bat an eye."

And the kicker is that people have already died due to his narcissistic re-election concerns that minimized the pandemic-to-come. How very sad and frightening that such a complete lack of integrity continues to inhabit the WH - without accountability."

He can drop an atomic bomb on a city somewhere.  He can betray all our allies and sell all our secrets.  His actions don't, and won't change minds.

""Fellow Americans, I have something simple and terrible to confess to you.  I am, and have been a pathological liar all my life.  I always pretend I know a lot.  Really, I don't know anything and understand very little.  I listen to  Hannity and more recently I spoke with Carlson.  That's how I changed my mind on the corona virus.  I tried to pretend it was a Democratic and media hoax.  But then, because of a British study over the weekend, I found out that this epidemic could hit my presidency really hard.  So all my bullying of Powell couldn't help fix the economy.  And then I could lose the November election.  They could even try to go after me and my family for all that we have done while I've been in office. After all, no matter what I said before, the Russians helped me win in 2016 and Flynn promised them I'd lift sanctions.   I've made money through the presidency on my investments.  So has Ivanka, and so has Jared, so have my sons.  There, you have it all.  And you know what, none of my supporters will believe that I said any of this.  So it won't make any difference.  After all, they really believe I was a successful executive because of seeing me in ""The Apprentice"".  What next, will they believe I was a pro wrestler?"
2020-03-17 23:00:36,Trump tested negative because the virus didn't want to infect its best ally.

Obviously the Coronavirus would still present a serious world crisis even if Hillary Clinton were president, but the US would have taken the threat seriously from the very beginning, our response would have been much more competent and many American lives would ultimately have been saved."

Trump is despicable because his flaws are both so serious and such an essential part of his character.  He is completely unsuited to deal with this crisis on our behalf, but here's tbe thing:

At  the moment he is the only president we have, and no other world leader is offering a better alternative.  We are all in this ship togetber and it is on fire and sinking.  We can give the captain a chance to try to get things moving in a better direction, or we can pile on ... provoking, goading, and belittling him ... knowing how to get the worst possible reaction from him.

 Then we'll hear how HE told Fauci we needed to ""flatten the curve"" and then he explained what that meant. Because he came up with that whole concept. And everyone was just astounded at his brilliance. And they were taking notes as he explained it all to them.

That's why I took tremendous steps, the biggest steps ever taken, better than the Dems wanted me to take, better than what Obama or Biden would have done, to make it better.  And what i did worked.  Yuge numbers of more people would have died, and the stock market would have dropped eeven bigger.  Only I was capable of doing all this.""

And even worse: The Republicans will agree, and his Base of Deplorables will cheer that the virus mostly effected populations of Liberal voters clustered in Blue state urban areas.  (Go read The Hill or Fox News; they're already doing that!)

His filed statements showed he made roughly $600 million in 2016. What they don't show, though, is what I suspect is true: he'll owe a great deal of income tax when The Trump Organization finally sells its properties. My very strong hunch is that, through the beauty of 1031 exchanges, most or all of those properties have a very low tax basis, so that he'll owe a very hefty tax on the gains when they're sold."

He's like Mrs. Bennett in Pride and Prejudice who, when George Wickam is shown to be a ""villain"", whom she had simpered around,  insists she always knew he was evil...and as soon as he's married to her daughter adores him again. 

Just 2 weeks ago Trump was saying the number of cases would be down to zero.  Now that there are 5000 cases and 100 death and ""he always knew"".

Personally, I've finally arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Trump suffers from a diagnosable disorder that would be laughable on a TV show, an annoyance were he a member of your extended family, a challenging problem for a clinician, but unfortunately is extremely damaging and even deadly as a leader."

Weeks from now the Fox Propaganda crowd will have no memory of calling it a hoax or leaving the country vulnerable and completely unprepared.

Unqualified Donald can however take solace in reaching the exclusive club of the worst Presidents in American history:

When the South seceded in 1860, Buchanan did nothing.

When the Corona Virus hit in 2020, Trump did nothing,

My wife and I and my daughter-in-law are in full panic mode as our oldest son, a young physician at a major nearby hospital, has just been ordered to the front-lines in triaging patients with absolutely none of the gear necessary to protect him and his patients. Trump's criminal dereliction of duty even today is putting both our entire population in jeopardy and endangering those first responders who are being thrown into battle without the armaments to fight it.  This is a war against a killer virus, but Trump's focus is on the economy and corporate bailouts that will only worsen the looming catastrophe that is causing the economic collapse.

They could have already infected tens of thousands, and spread it over many parts of the nation.  Holding off testing allowed this kind of propagation.  And we've only just touched the surface.  With carriers like this we could be looking at cases in the tens of thousands in no time."

In the grand scheme of things it might not mean anything for any of us. But I still think it's important to expose the gaslighting. He and Fox News downplayed the risks and seriousness from the start, and it's a perfect example of an unfortunate but consistent terrible first instinct. With just about everything they lead with the narrative they want to be true. We'll never know what the situation would look like if Trump, from the start, had relied on scientists and medical professionals in an area where effective policy is as important as the number of hospital beds.

Just as the mistakes made by Chinese at the onset have made the impact worse elsewhere.
Now after dismissing the threat of the virus and reassuring Americans  for weeks, and thereby squandering opportunities for preparedness, he is denying it all. The fact that its all on record seems to be of no impediment to his mendacity. Can you imagine what his tax returns and scholastic records would reveal - no wonder he has gone to great lengths to suppress their publication. 
This virus along with Climate Change demonstrate that Trump's drumbeat of America First is in reality a a Trump First that hurts the world at large including Americans and especially many of the people who vote for him. 
In recent past he attempted to buyout a German company that is in the vanguard of coronavirus vaccine development - on condition that it would be used exclusively for the USA . One presumes the motive being that he could then secure a second term by being man who saved Americans. Never mind the 100,000s who would perish beyond the US borders.

2) ""For the first month or so, why did you repeatedly claim you had it - quote: 'under control,' and that the number of cases was - quote: 'going substantially down, not up' - which was completely false, while the virus was spread exponentially world-wide?""

3) You claim you knew we were facing a pandemic when you first heard about it, yet as late as March at Mar-a-Lago, with the president of Brazil at your side, you said ""I'm not concerned at all"" about the outbreak?  If you knew it was a pandemic, why did you shrug it off?

I want viewers of the debates to hear Trump respond to such questions without a Teleprompter.  I expect his answers will be as ridiculous and transparently self-serving as usual, perhaps worse under pressure on live television, and once again demonstrate his incompetence and utter inability to tell the truth."

Trump also attempted a coverup, but here scientists like Dr. Fauci said no to that, this is serious. Still Trump wasted precious weeks doing nothing to get in front of the disease.

Twittering giggles for certain howlers, riotous peels for genuine can't be topped ones...murmurs of bemusement to suggest  there is no  clue where in the world that one came from, etc. etc.

Since trump is a tv creature you have to use tv methods 
to push back at his orwellian strategies of disinformation. 
It does little if any good just to point out in tones of 
MSM gravitas that such and such utterance is made up or simply not true. 

They've been trying to do that without any great effect since 
day 1 of this  maladministration's woeful reign of the big lie. 
But it just doesn't have any effect. He feels perfectly confident that anything he says will get reported and that is
all that counts for him. Introducing a form of deux ex machina derision consistently would make it more

Tests would have to be validated, which essentially means that they would have to work to certain parameters a very large part of the time.  Today, someone in the press conference said there was a 47 percent false positive rate...that is completely ridiculous.  This would never pass validation.  Validation guarantees that the same results can be replicated to within a very narrow set of parameters, determined by establish scientific evaluation.  It's hard to see scientists, standing shoulder to shoulder with 
Trump, defending his failure to use not only the German test, but the Seattle flu test which caught the first case of Corona.  That study...then up and running was shut down.  Trump may well have known that this was a pandemic, but he was determined to not be transparent with actual data, and that continues to this day, causing deaths.  We are still well behind in testing and in a few weeks we can expect an explosion of new infections and no doubt more deaths.  Shameful!"
2020-03-18 00:27:26,"I know Trump is delusional and the part of whichever cortex or lobe it is that houses short- term memory is badly damaged. Some heroic doctor needs to inform Trump that the results were wrong, that he *is* infected and must immediately go into seclusion. And that electronic devices are now believed to accelerate the particles (which particles isn't important, Trump will believe it)."
2020-03-18 00:29:10,"I don't understand why reporters who are present at these briefings don't specifically cite Trump's earlier statements and  plainly call him out on his lies. Is it for fear that they'll lose access to these forums?

It's all well and good for the NYT to do these after-the-fact rundowns, but I think he should have to publicly address his lies - even if he just lies some more. At least it will be in real time and on camera."
2020-03-18 00:30:53,"Perhaps he knew and decided to let the pandemic run its course for a while, because it will mainly disable and kill people in cities, as opposed to small rural communities. He has much less support in the cities. And dead people don't vote, or participate in the census!

Cynical, I know. But all those closed-door HHS meetings, with no health experts... were they just about spinning? Perhaps a darker strategy was discussed as well."
2020-03-18 00:05:53,"I cringe every time he steps up to a microphone. Not only do we not know what he is going to say next, I believe he doesn't know what he is going to say next. Lying is normal for him and it has become the new normal for his supporters. They have learned to embrace it. What is truly disappointing is his enablers. He sees the world only through a political perspective."
2020-03-18 00:09:43,"Sort of an ad in Pennsylvania. It claims Trump knows everything.  And I can only guess Fox knows everything?  And Nunez knows everything, almost?  Evidently when they are all asleep and open their eyes, they claim they know everything. But it is not worth the world knows. It is not what they stated to us in reality.  Yet is our reality. It is what  has been previously stated. And Trump and Fox in  not in reality. I often  wonder are they real Americans?"
2020-03-18 00:25:18,"Sigh... Honestly, I’m beginning to think he doesn’t even know when he’s lying. Whatever he says in the moment becomes the undisputed past-preset-future to him... November cannot come soon enough."

2020-03-18 00:28:55,"Isn't any surprise that our President paints himself as innocent when he and his administration's policies were actually complicit in leading to the Coronavirus pandemic and its spread here in the US.  He thinks throwing $1000 checks to people who live paycheck to paycheck, a number of whom have likely permanently lost their jobs, doesn't begin to address the financial ruin many will suffer.  What about those millions of tests, tests yet to be rolled out.  He knows too well when the real testing begins, it will become more apparent that he is a fraud and failed at keeping Americans safe.  Any leader worth being called one would own up to the missteps he/she made in helping to create this mess.  And yet, he still finds the time to tweet about Benghazi and Sleepy Joe.  The best thing that could happen for our country right now would be for Trump and Pence to resign."
2020-03-18 00:37:21,"Apparently the author is ignoring the large number of people who look at trump as a leader. I find it incredible that such a person could be the leader of the most powerful nation on earth.

2020-03-18 00:46:06,"This claim,  whether true or false is additional evidence that Trump does not have the necessary temperament to serve as an effective President.  If the claim he knew this novel coronavirus would become a pandemic is true, it simply means that intentionally decided not to protect the security of the nation.  

However, until very recently, Trump dismissed the seriousness of the virus and  claimed it was a hoax perpetrated by the ""democrats and the media"".  Since many such statements were made on national television and witnessed by millions, it is clearly evident that he not being truthful.  Again, evidence that the man is not fit to serve as President of the U.S."
2020-03-18 00:30:01,"But he and his friends get tested even without showing symptoms.  Testing is there ""for everybody.""  Except ordinary people who are not connected to him. Then those ""beautiful tests"" don't exist!"

I hope he suffers the most humiliating defeat of any candidate, ever."
2020-03-17 23:40:38,"The gross negligence and ineptitude of the Trump administration in denying the crisis presented by this very dangerous virus has been on full display for many weeks.  It is outrageous for Donald Trump to tell us that he has known all along this was a pandemic. This is such a ridiculous lie that one wonders if the man who uttered those words has not taken leave of his senses.   

For those of my fellow citizens who continue to support Trump, please keep in mind, that this man, without question, is responsible for our failure to mount a massive effort to contain a disease that has the potential to kill upwards of 1 million of our friends and relatives.  

This is no longer about politics."

2020-03-17 23:59:44,"A total lack of credible leadership from DC, specifically from Trump and the GOP. 

Trump lies so continuously and outrageously that no one outside the credulous White rube demographic believes anything he says. He’s so focused on how he looks and his re-election that admitting that we face a national disaster, or advocating for a national response has been beyond his grasp. 

Rather than pressing the military budget and resources in action to fortify our healthcare response, he still has them working to build walls against brown people coming into the country. He has missed the mark.

Business Admin 101 teaches that you can’t manage what you don’t measure. Trump abdicated the responsibility to put our testing on a war footing, to identify and manage this outbreak. We face the twelfth hour knowing that we're all on our own, hoping local and state leadership will be enough.The crosshairs of responsibility are on Trump and the GOP."
2020-03-18 01:09:31,Trump was finally overruled. What he says is no longer important.
2020-03-18 01:07:14,"He's always at it,  making it up according to what he
is sure will sell at any particular moment. It matters little if it is ""true"" since there is no  political cost when it demonstrably isn't. He has, after all, his
finger on the faucet of  most, if not all  the campaign money for any non democratic party candidate for congress. 

He therefore controls
the subsequent discourse to whatever he comes up with. 
As long as only democrats complain it doesn't matter one
iota. That is easily manageable. 

If there is no pushback from  his allies, and 
no pushback from his propaganda channel, there is no
price to pay. Life is good in this bubble of disinformation.
There is no such thing as   effective pushback. 

He is fully aware that truth means nothing at all to his cult, and that is whom  he needs to drive to the polls in November. Saying whatever that will energize  them  to vote is the only thing that counts. 

Democrats don't and never will think that way. 

When 40+% of a country belongs to such a brain deadening, mind neutralizing cult, that country is in dire straits of 
losing contact with reality. The resulting delusion can 
then lead to seriously delusional behavior. We  need to be aware of that. 

The virus is an equal opportunity opponent, it doesn't
care if you believe or not his gibberish. It'll  take 
many  victims from within the cult to convince at
least some that  he said 
was a dangerous  lie which contributed to their own source of individual loss."
2020-03-18 01:14:15,"Another theatrical performance for TV. I found it interesting that we know that some of those people on stage have come in close contact, including the Failed President, to people who have tested positive to this virus, yet they talk about “social separation”, but they were all together in close quarters to each other and shared the one microphone."
2020-03-18 01:02:36,"""Some of his critics have stretched his comment to suggest that he was calling the virus itself a hoax, but his supporters have argued that he was referring to the Democratic criticism, not the virus itself.""

That wasn't a ""stretch"" - it was the plain meaning and intention of what Trump said.  That the whole virus scare was a hoax.

The stretch is trying to make believe he was talking about something else."
2020-03-18 00:49:36,"It's what an ten-year-old does. The child makes things up. When challenged, he says, ""I never said that."" He changes what he has said, to show that he's like an adult---he knows what big people know. With Trump, of course, it's the reverse. The adult who has the mental and emotional age of a child. This is the person who is the President of the United States."

2020-03-18 01:13:14,"Trump has been melting down since the first signs of the pandemic showed up and he started to realize that it could jeopardize his re-election prospects.

It’s time to implement the 25th amendment which was designed specifically for situations like the one we are in."
2020-03-18 00:48:29,"The sad part is that Trump's supporters don't care; supporters include both his voting base and every elected person who declares to be a Republican. As a society, we once held elected officials to a higher standard, remember Nixon? In the end, we all lose."
2020-03-18 00:51:40,"If we are fed up with Trump's lies, gaslighting, spin, manipulation, attacks, corruption, and disregard for our democracy....we should spend more time on other discussion boards pointing out his flaws.  This forum is a bit of an echo chamber, which is fine.  But to return Trump to the private sector where he belongs, we need to engage other people and present facts to them.  If you can get one or two other people to at least consider an alternative to Trump who didn't previously do so, you will deserve kudos."
2020-03-18 00:53:37,"He’s now saying he always knew it was a pandemic?

So is he lying now or was he lying before?

Probably both, as he may not truly believe that to be true even now. 

Whatever he says to fit the current circumstances is his version of his truth."
2020-03-18 01:00:10,"And then there was the whopper during this morning's press conference. A reporter asked about the government turning down tests from the WHO. Trump passed the question to Dr. Birx. She gave an indirect but coherent answer (I believe it's since been exposed as a big stretch). Trump felt compelled to chime in ""They didn't offer and we declined.""

Just how deep is this rabbit hole?"
2020-03-18 01:03:29,"A wonderful article with some valuable and tragically accurate facts and information  that wont make a lick of difference to the average supporter of this President. 
Trump approval rating and the number of Republicans believing that the  media's coverage of Covid-19 both ironically hover around 46%.
His claim that he could shoot someone  in Times Square and get away with it, is probably one of the few truthful statements he has made . It is more than troubling that close to 50% of the population  stubbornly support this man,  
Once the threat of the virus has subsided there is clearly going to be Congressional investigations as to how Trumps administration mishandled the pandemic. 
There is  in addition  clearly  a  need for a national discussion as to how our education system has  failed us.  How can so many of our populace  be so lacking in basic common sense and  have an inability to recognize the difference between right and wrong."
2020-03-18 01:08:59,"So let me get this straight.

Trump knew from the beginning this would be a pandemic.  So he didn't order any test kits.  Or ventilators.  Or masks.

The sadder part is that if he HAD known, he wouldn't have done any of those things unless he made money on them."

2020-03-18 00:56:34,"Once again, Mr. Trump attempts to rewrite his own history.  In addition to the examples that your informative article sited, wasn't it about 10 days-2 weeks ago when the President exclaimed at one of his rallies that the CornoaVirus was another hoax by the Democrats?  

I can answer that question ""yes"" because I saw it on TV numerous times."
2020-03-18 01:15:30,"I wish I could believe that the American people would remember  on Election Day how this man talked about there being only 15 cases in the US when there were already over 60 and how he talked about it just going away in a matter of weeks. 

But the American people have demonstrated time and again their deficient memories and their appalling susceptibility to transparently false propaganda. 

By the time November rolls around, at least half the voters will have internalized the myth of a world-class response to the crisis by this president, promoted relentlessly by his media partisans. He won't pay a price. And this only highlights again a deeper problem: the low-info gullibility of the American people will make the empowerment of another Trump an ever-present possibility even if we do manage to get rid of him."
2020-03-18 00:47:43,"And I thought he had said a couple of weeks ago that we had 15 cases and would be down to zero in no time.  This ""very stable genius"" represents leadership we have never seen.  That I can tell you."

2020-03-18 01:05:15,"Trump reminds me Jim Jones of Jonestown. The idea that you can say anything, and people worshiping you could believe you to their death. The Fremen in Dune, and the cult around them, also had the belief in their power to shatter bone and stone with a word. Trump's followers believe his words have this effect of changing the world. The difference is that that was a sci-fi novel. This cult will lead to certain death for people."

This is how he has gone through his life while others are left to suffer the consequences.

Enough of this.
He must be voted out in November."
2020-03-18 00:31:13,We should long be past being surprised that Trump is the ultimate con artist. He is truly the preeminent disseminator of ‘Fake News’.  This is the same arrogant man who maintained to Bob Woodward in late 2018: “Nobody’s ever done a better job than I’m doing as President”; history will not treat this President kindly.
2020-03-18 01:11:47,"Trump lies and his base apparently does not care.  Even in a life and death situation, they don't care."

2020-03-18 00:55:53,Liars will lie. Only in the alternate universe inhabited by Trump enablers will this be believed. There have been so many of these lies over the last three years that one becomes inured to them.
2020-03-18 01:56:23,"I am part of the citizenry over 60+. I would leave my home only under dire circumstances. I am literally betting my life every time I walk out of the house. When I return the clock goes back to day one for the count.  Anxiety level is always high.  I am lucky because there is only myself.  My family members are fighting this battle in other parts of the country.  President Trump stand aside, stop talking and leave the professionals to do their work."
2020-03-18 01:28:04,"This is exactly what you get when you have 'stable genius'  running the country. Totally incompetent and unprepared. Just in last 10 years military budget was over 7,000 billion dollars. If we just spent 0.1 % of that money on emergency medical equipment we would be in much better position now. Other administrations are not without blame for what we are experiencing now."
2020-03-18 01:34:59,"He always does this. He also said he predicted the GFC even though he launched a home lending company on the eve of the GFC. Why enter the home lending market on the eve of its collapse? Unless you were oblivious to the forthcoming collapse.  That is the case with trump, he was oblivious to the GFC, just like he was oblivious to how bad this would get. But its his nature to claim he ''knew all along'' - it gives him a sense of superiority. Its behavior indicative of a small person."
2020-03-18 01:17:21,"The question about Corona virus is- was it inevitable. With a vaccine a year away their were only two possibilities, let it in, let it do it’s thing, people get sick, people recover, the recover build the antibodies that hold off future epidemics, this was one way of thinking. The other way was to close all borders and ground all places. The virus can’t swim, and it can’t fly, so holding it at bay by isolating the country from the rest of the world, was a strategy. Obviously the United States picked the former, let it in and let’s have our epidemic between March and June. Europe has the same strategy it seems, other countries like Russia and India sealed their borders had very few cases, but are that one super spreader from being exactly where we are.
  If a treatment for Corona Virus is found in the next two months, then our strategy was a fiasco, we kept the planes coming in for two weeks, those people infected the country, now the planes are grounded anyway.
  If no treatment for Corona Virus is found and a vaccine in fact takes a year, we will be wrapping up our epidemic by July, while the countries that isolated themselves, have to stay in isolation and pray no one slips through. Or they get to go through the whole thing, just on a different time frame.
  Isolation is of course the best policy, a drug will be found that treats Corona, and the countries that were able to hold it off, will have that knowledge 
 Can we get a redo?"
2020-03-18 02:03:14,"It makes one wonder if Trump will ever be held accountable for what he has said, much less what he has done. 

It boggles the imagination that he so consistently escapes being personally label for what he is and held accountable."
2020-03-18 02:14:28,"As a foreigner, I can only say how blessed you are to have a President who saw very early that this is not just a flu, but a serious pandemic. 

It is so heartening to see that he did everything to alert the American people early, so that precautions could be made, test kits ordered, and that literally everything is ""under tremendous control"".

I am hopeful that all this foresight will be rewarded in November!"
2020-03-18 02:05:23,"When Trump stood at the podium yesterday, he was seen as being “presidential.”  Thank heaven that he at last admitted that we now have a very serious problem, perhaps unprecedented.  So he gets a little credit for that.  

It really is a matter of too little too late, however.  The “alternate facts” universe has run up against hard, rugged rocks of facts and is being torn apart.  

This is what happens when incompetent leadership is elected to office.  This administration has to be turned out. So this fall, vote as if your life depends on defeating Trump:  because it literally does as we are seeing now."
2020-03-18 02:09:36,"OK, Trump's throwing money at the virus problem. Giving money away to anyone who wants it.

How about directing multiple laboratories to develop and mass produce a coronavirus test?

How about directing multiple laboratories to develop a vaccine?

How about some real leadership?"
2020-03-18 01:19:29,The man has been lying for the last 3(0?) years.  Should we have expected anything different this time?  The more astounding thing to me is that his followers just continue to dismiss it.  We all have our job to do in November.
2020-03-18 01:57:33,"I still, to this day, after the 2016 election results came sliding in, wonder how his base continues to believe him.  What struck me today at the newest televised charade was how they huddled so close together on that podium.   Not very good modeling for social distancing!  By contrast, when Sen. Schumer spoke at the Dem response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he and a colleague left the stage several feet from each other.  Trump could have spoken the words he offered today back in January when things were accelerating.  Instead he tried again today to sell snake oil.  And his supporters will continue to buy it--by the bucketsful."
2020-03-18 01:24:41,"I regret to say that I am not surprised nor shocked at the way President Trump has addressed the issue. ""Nothing is his fault."" ""Everyone is out to make him look bad."" ""I've done a better job than Obama and the do nothing Democrats."" November can't come soon enough."
2020-03-18 02:06:07,"And so the revisionism begins, it will only become more emphatic and elaborate.

Tell me I'm I being too paranoid."

2020-03-18 01:54:10,"So, trump intends to pump billions into the stock market to protect his rich friends instead of to fight Coronavirus.   I really wish that I was shocked but Trump always does the worst possible thing."
2020-03-18 01:44:04,Trump good at social distancing from truth. At least six feet. And helping something happen is different than predicting it.
2020-03-18 01:49:39,"Your average risk analyst would rate Trump's liability in this matter as, to use Trump's favorite term, ""a disaster""."

2020-03-18 01:11:50,"Trump's lies and gaslighting and ignorance and arrogance and cruelty (he's still trying to take away food stamps) during this unprecedented crisis. . .  if those aren't high crimes,  the phrase has no meaning.  When this is over, impeach again, yes, even if it's right in the middle of the presidential election--and this time, make it stick."
2020-03-17 22:54:35,Everyone - Dems and GOPers alike knew he was a liar before he took office. I'm guessing more lies yet to come for the remainder of his living days.  The act of lying defines him.
2020-03-17 23:10:41,"In Trump world, reality is whatever he says it is. There truth is always relative. He offers a batch of ""alternative facts"" which are simply his wish list, & expects his gullible followers to  believe it all without questioning. 

  He has been telling so many outrageous lies for so long that the bar is set quite low in terms of his overall credibility. By now the press is so inured to his prevarications that he is rarely called out for his latest whopper. 

 Anyone who isn't living under a rock realizes that Trump has been actively downplaying this virus' threat for several months. To hear him claim that he knew it was a pandemic all along is a pathetic attempt to rewrite history. He recognizes that his failure to respond appropriately to this crisis demonstrates his incompetence & will probably doom his chances for re-election. It's the desperate last ditch effort of a failing man who is in way over his head. It doesn't fool anyone."
2020-03-18 00:04:31,"If the president knew it would be a pandemic, why didn't he act on it?  If he wasn't really in denial, which is bad enough, and really did know, he should be tried for manslaughter.  He is incompetent, unintelligent, unethical, immoral, and criminal.  Woe are we."
2020-03-17 23:09:17,Biden's campaign ads should consist of nothing but clips of Trump spewing lie after lie. We can only hope that enough sane  voters make it to the polls in November.

2020-03-17 22:53:47,Trump lies about absolutely everything. For Trump to lie about the Covid19 is just par for the course.
2020-03-17 23:13:00,"Exactly! 
He knew it and did NOTHING until it became too late. 
Shameful."
2020-03-18 00:43:00,"Once you tweet something Mr. President, it is a permanent record for the rest of time.  At least your record is consistent:  lies, misstatements of facts and more lies.  You have cleverly manipulated  the power of your office and State Run media (Fox/Your Twitter account) to get away with this.Coronavirus has exposed you as a fraud to everyone. A hoax?  A hunch it will go away?  The American people now know who you are: a man who will always put himself before the people and the earth."
2020-03-18 01:10:24,I love that you included Trump's previous quotes that contradict his absurd claim.  I'll bet he hates that - it must be so annoying when your own words betray you...
2020-03-18 00:33:55,"C'mon people.  As long as he's a bigot and cruel, he perfectly reflects his supporters.  They know he's lying, but it hurts other people.  That's how they know they are ""up""."

2020-03-18 00:34:27,The man lies more easily than most of us take breaths.
2020-03-18 01:19:58,"He thinks this may now play to his favor; you could sense it today in his press conference: “Not my fault, but here I am to save all of you.” Don’t let him get away with this! Don’t forget that he is the reason we have such incredibly inadequate testing! He is the reason our economy has ground to a halt!  And he and Mitch are planning to starve government by giving bailouts - with our money- to industries that have no right to those funds. Don’t take your eye off this ball: Trump and his Administration- including that incompetent Jared Kushner - are the reason our great country is in this terrible place. Hold them accountable!"
2020-03-18 00:30:38,"""The president tried to rewrite his history with advising Americans about the coronavirus. His own words prove him wrong."" No. His own words prove that he is a habitual liar who will say anything to people in order to get attention, dominate the airwaves and--yes--avoid taking responsibility for his ineptness, his lack of action and his heartlessness."
2020-03-18 02:49:51,"Huh ... interesting. So he knew it would be a pandemic long before anyone called it a pandemic and then he did exactly ... nothing. Makes sense. I'd expect nothing more from the poseur. He may want to reconsider this claim, in light of his administration's woefully inadequate response to what he ""knew"" would become a pandemic."
2020-03-18 02:29:47,"I am enraged, and listening and reading wonder if I’m the only one? For now, those of us in hot spots must be good citizens and follow orders to shelter in place. My family and I are doing this faithfully, two parents working from home and two children now online schooling. But, this is a short term solution, sustainable for weeks, not months. We cannot rely only on social distancing forever! People simply can’t stop working, caring for family, learning, and interacting for months in end without economic and social collapse. Where are the demands for a strategic plan? 
1. We need testing immediately. Both test for those who believe they have it AND test that can determine if you have already had it. This would allow those who have it to be quickly isolated and those who already had it to now move more freely in society— getting groceries for that elderly aunt or going back to work.
2. We need ventilators. And radical solutions such as the federal government using 3-D printers and demanding (and then financially compensating) companies with the capability to mass produce them.
3. Masks, gloves, hand sanitizer— same with respect to government intervention and financial pressure/support to convert factories temporarily.
4. Mass public relations about proper hand washing and healthy habits during the outbreak.
5. Auxiliary hospitals run with military assistance if needed to care for those that are ill in a compassionate, safe manner. 
Why aren’t our politicians demanding  this?!"
2020-03-18 02:39:44,"There is simply no bottom to this man. None...

Though it is hard to ignore the president (lower case intended) we would all be better off if we did. Lets feed our angst into getting Biden and his down ballot votes to the polls come November. Throw the whole lot of them out of power - Presidency, House, Senate, every state and local election - the whole works. Out. Done. Over."
2020-03-18 03:00:51,"This will become the narrative, and he will leverage any success to win in November. We must not let him get away with this. 

If lies are repeated and not refuted, they become truth."
2020-03-18 02:25:37,So Trump with his amazing powers of foresight saw very early on that there would be a serious pandemic and yet he took no real significant steps to prepare the U.S. until it had already started spreading significantly here. I guess that's what he's saying.
2020-03-18 02:54:40,the powerful can lie anytime they want to and may not be held accountable even when it puts hundreds of thousands of lives at risk
2020-03-18 02:55:45,"There is a psychological theory that most Trump supporters tend to be people with low self-esteem. In my circle of friends, I would say that this is very often the case. He somehow makes them feel better about themselves. Every Trump addict that I know watches Fox News exclusively."
2020-03-18 01:35:47,"Why even bother?  We all know truth is malleable, despite evidence to the contrary."
2020-03-18 01:44:29,"This article fails to mention all the numerous instances in which Mr. Trump downplays (in his speeches and tweets) the Coronavirus crisis, by comparing it to the number of annual influenza cases and deaths."
2020-03-18 02:04:08,"1. This is not about him. Period.
2. He needs to stop speaking, immediately."
2020-03-18 02:23:27,"Katie, why did you leave out the fact that Trump was against the cruise ship stuck 30 miles off the coast of San Francisco  docking because it already had cases of covid-19 and he didn't want them landing and ruining the low numbers of cases at the time?

Why was Trump's consistent response for the past few weeks only about the economy and not about the health and well-being of Americans?  

The instances of  lies heaped upon the American public by Trump and his administration throughout his tenure is legion, but this is  particularly true in the last 2 months because of his inability to focus on, or even accept reality.  Trump and his minions convince themselves that their lies are real. Today Trump  had the audacity to give himself an A+ for his administration's response to the crisis. 

What we are witnessing (and the victims of) is an administration functioning on Magical Thinking,  instead of clear and effective responses to real and dire crises.  It is terrifying to behold. And, woe to us."
2020-03-18 02:38:57,"If the Corona virus miraculous vanished overnight, Trump would likely claim he knew that was going to happen also. His claims of being a genius are symptomatic of another condition, which by now is self evident."
2020-03-18 03:33:38,Isn't it time to ask Mr. Trump if his discovery that the pandemic is not a hoax has led him to reconsider his stance on climate change?
2020-03-18 03:43:28,"Once, just once, I would like to see one of these minions, props --- people, speak up when he lies to their faces. The other day, when Trump was at the CDC (a line of doctors, virologists and scientists behind him) he bragged they told him ""he really gets this stuff,"" and should be working on it in a research capacity--- I was thinking, oh God, please somebody say something. Somebody stand up and say, ""Mr President, with all due respect, and with all the respect due to the office you hold"" no one here said that to you. Just stop it, please. For God's sake."""
2020-03-18 03:57:04,Trump did know. He just didn't want people to panic which is why he was secretly working behind the scenes on policy whilst keeping the people calm. Full credit to him. He didn't just come up with this economic response over night. That took time. The same can be said about the virus itself. Trump will find a cure. I have no doubt. Very soon!
2020-03-18 02:23:40,The reporters clearly misheard. What Trump actually said was that this pandemic is why he is going to postpone the elections.
2020-03-18 02:41:45,"The political theorist Hannah Arendt once wrote that the most successful totalitarian leaders of the 20th century instilled in their followers ""a mixture of gullibility and cynicism."" When they were lied to, they chose to believe it. When a lie was debunked, they claimed they'd known all along—and would then ""admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness."" Over time, Arendt wrote, the onslaught of propaganda conditioned people to ""believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true."""
2020-03-18 01:23:56,"Any respect the world may have for America's leadership is fading. The president of the US is a habitual, automatic liar. He feels no discomfort about his compulsion. 

His party's state media FOX News automatically transmits his lies to the public---and much of that public has been groomed to accept them-- ---No Matter What.
This has made a mockery of our democracy.

The US political system, instead of solving the problems of the public, manipulates the public.  Candidates and proposals can easily be advertised and marketed like any consumer product. The media ads for this cost a fortune, so must be financed by mega donors. They can then call the shots, setting limits in lawmaking for their gain--and our loss. 

But 1 party is better than the other, of course, so we can stand in long lines to vote---and then hope. Is there any truth to the sales job? Or is it another con job?

The US has given ultimate power to a person who lives in his own Reality TV world, ruled by ego and dominance over others. His courtiers have flocked to Tsar Trump the Terrible to share in and exploit the power he gives them. 

Can we hope for a regime change? Will it be just 'better than Trump'?  Or can Americans restore hope in Representation for Our Taxation? That's what our colonies demanded from King George the 3rd, in our revolution against imperial colonialization.

This era in American politics will be taught in history classes from now on. Will the lesson help our future?"
2020-03-18 03:32:26,"We should call this pandemic ""Authoritarian Virus"" or ""Xi/Trump."" 

The first response of Xi Jinping and the Communist Party to the virus in December was to protect their control of society at home and their prestige abroad by covering it up. The police hauled away the doctor who first sounded the alarm and made him sign a pledge to stop his ""illegal activities."" And they stepped up censorship of social media as more people talked about the virus and the failure of their leaders to contain it. 

Once they could no longer cover up the burgeoning pandemic, they finally imposed draconian measures to contain it. But the authoritarian instinct to suppress any adverse information needlessly made the pandemic worse than it could have been. The propaganda machine has now rewritten history, claiming that Xi was heroically leading the fight against the virus before anyone ever heard of it. And the censors have been even busier. 

Our authoritarian leader did the same thing. Instead of heeding the early warning from China and taking steps to protect the country, Trump tried to protect himself. He first denied and minimized the virus, calling it a hoax and then a liberal plot to bring him down. He refused to take any action until the collapsing stock market convinced him the virus was impervious to his lies. And like his fellow authoritarian, he now he claims to have known all along. 

At least Trump doesn't have Xi's army of censors to wipe away the truth. For now."
2020-03-18 03:54:47,So he intentionally misled us in the face of a global crisis that will cause serious loss of American lives? How is that not impeachable?
2020-03-18 03:39:27,All of a sudden Trump is taking the crisis more seriously. He is thinking that could somehow put off the November election because of virus? Trump: We should not endanger people by letting them go to the polls or the workers running the polls. He might feel the economy could recover somewhat and a cure could be found during that delay and he could take credit for it. I would not put anything past him. He thinks only of himself.
2020-03-18 03:52:28,"And, Ladies & Gentlemen, he did not take the Coronavirus test. Said he took it, results were negative. 
Not a chance."
2020-03-18 03:57:06,"Perhaps Mike Bloomberg should put his skilled communications team to expose through TV commercials the web of deadly lies about the corona virus woven by the President.

It's really necessary, given the spell the President has placed on his ""base"", to keep reminding our citizens of how badly the Trump handled the first two months of the pandemic. 

He didn't have a clue COVID 19 was a pandemic and responsible Americans need to rub Trump's supporters' noses in it. I'm glad Trump finally realized we are in an emergency but like Hoover he was very late to the party.  The federal government's anemic response to the pandemic (until this week) is a powerful argument for giving Trump the Hoover treatment at the ballot box."
2020-03-18 03:57:44,"My personal favorite was a week ago when Trump told the nation that everyone should just ""stay calm and it will go away"", like the coronavirus was a bear wandering around the back yard looking for snacks or a dip in the pool.

Dear God, election day can't come soon enough!"
2020-03-18 03:12:20,"It has always been known that Trump is a self-centered and disingenious man. As long as he was a private person, this did little damage beyond his immediate circle. The surprising thing is that it's exactly these qualities that the Republican Party and roughly 45 percent of US voters seem to be looking for in their leader. It is therefore safe to assume that they, lacking a secure standard of human culture themselves, consider him the perfect personification of their own void."
2020-03-18 03:30:29,"When you elect people who think government is bad, you get bad government. Right now we have government that is criminally negligent. The lost opportunities--to require social distancing, to impose curfews, to manufacture ventilators now, to increase hospital beds--will result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands if not millions. And much of this could have been prevented by minimally competent government officials. This IS the job of government, which we just don't have. Impose curfews. Close down restaurants except for takeout and delivery. Limit store purchases of toilet paper, wipes, and hand sanitizer. People are endangering themselves by going to the store daily to try to find these items. It's not rocket science, government officials. Do your jobs, and kudos to those few of you who are."
2020-03-18 03:42:00,I would not be surprised if an investigative journalist were to find that that the long delay in test kit availability was because Trump and his cronies were attempting to profit from producing test kits that they manufactured.  So they refused to accept W.H.O. test kits and they allowed the virus to get a firm foothold in the USA because testing delays and greater proliferation of the virus would mean more profits?  Whatever the reason for the delay it helped US cases to grow from in one month's time from 15 cases to over 6500. That fact alone is reason enough to charge Trump with crimes against humanity.

I think at the moment we have to think more about 
Important things than to think about Trumps opinion
About the meaning of a word for a world wide spread of a virus."
2020-03-18 03:28:28,"Trump finally figured out the only way through what he sees mostly as a PR problem - an inconvenience to his ability to campaign on the economy - is to actually address the public health crisis. 

He can’t lie his way out of doing his job well this time. He doesn’t know what to do. 

Hopefully Trump will now allow others who have long believed the problem is serious to address it."

Neither numbers were true, of course. I guess none of trumps' supporters who continue to believe him have read the book - 1984."
2020-03-18 00:53:09,It was obvious that his presser today was a campaign event. He hogged the microphone. It was such a relief when the scientists and doctors were finally permitted to present factual information.
2020-03-18 01:06:37,"I just skimmed through Trump’s tweets over the past month and it is obvious that Trump only began to take the coronavirus seriously on March 11, when the WHO called it a pandemic.  The few times he tweets about the coronavirus before that, it’s to say either that the media and Democrats are needlessly sowing panic or that he made a brilliant decision in January to close our borders to China and that move would keep us safe.  Meanwhile, Americans are falling ill after travel to places other than China, including travel within the U.S.  It’s impossible to believe that Trump ever thought we were facing a pandemic.  His tweets suggest he wasn’t thinking about the coronavirus at all.  Tweet after tweet is about politics, mostly his bid for re-election.  And doesn’t he realize that saying he knew all along that the coronavirus would turn into a pandemic just makes him look all the more inept?  He’s left a trail of indifference to the virus in his daily tweets."
2020-03-18 00:59:59,"He has publicly proclaimed that he ""knew"" it was not going to be a pandemic and that it was going to be a pandemic.

Two lies always equals the truth within the easily bruised psyche of Donald Trump. 

His next lie is likely to be that his administration did NOT decline to purchase millions of COVID-19 tests from the World Health Organization in January, although Trump did decline, believing they would not be needed that urgently.

The lie after that will be to blame Obama for some phantom regulation that obstructed how quickly U.S. based organizations could produce enough tests even though no such regulation exists...oh wait, he already told that lie. It's hard to keep track isn't it?"

2020-03-18 01:23:20,"So, why the shortage of ventilators and testing kits with such prescience?"
2020-03-18 01:02:56,"Trump lied about the extent and severity of this virus, and that has  directly led to a wider spread of the virus than it should have been. His actions within the government led to lack of testing, that also contributed to the spread.
This is not about politics. That is why trump initially played down the seriousness of the COVID virus. He was afraid it would impact ""his numbers"". This is about our leaders doing what is best for the people that they serve, and making sure that their safety and wellbeing comes first. Trump was and is concerned about himself first. He only became concerned about the virus when he saw that it was impacting him politically. Then, he continued the lies by stating that he never said the things that he said.

Enough, please. GOP leadership, please put someone in charge of this crisis who cares about the health and well being of our people. I don't care about their political views, and long as they have a competent response to this crisis."

Yes, in the sense of someone ""leading"" the country, we no longer really have a president anymore. 
However.
It is not the president's foolish and transparently self-serving lies that disturb me now.  It is the desperate, unceasing support of the GOP in the Senate.  The fawning, and the bowing and scraping of the Cabinet.  The State TV ambitions of FOX News, which has told a large portion of the population that they can only trust the president.   All these people knew perfectly well that the president had become a clear and present danger to the country.  Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller are the most powerful voices in the White House.
Last week, an analyst on cable news said that even Dr. Anthony Fauci, the respected scientist leading the response team, was himself becoming tainted for continuing to compromise with Trump's lies and contradictions.  (I hope that doesn't happen.)

""All men lamented.""  
(Pardon the sexism.)"
2020-03-18 03:15:42,"The remarkable thing is that Trump now probably truly believes that he always thought this would be a pandemic.  Lying is his brain's default operation, most especially regarding himself.  This illustrates why he had five bankruptcies and why many of us could foresee a disaster coming after he was elected.  Well, here it is.  Trump refused to see it coming, in which case he guilty of colossal negligence; or he always felt it would be a pandemic, in which case he is guilty of colossal irresponsibility and negligence.  Republicans have to be made to understand this so we can be rid of him."
2020-03-18 03:11:17,Trump voters have the attention span of a gnat.  This is why Trump has been able to recreate reality on an almost daily basis.  Sometimes you wonder if his people are  conscious functioning human beings.

Do they really believe that the ends always justify the means?  Is this what they are teaching their children?  If so, contrary to what their little red baseball caps say, America in NOT going to be great again.  Ever."
2020-03-18 01:47:03,"He will say that the deaths were inevitable and unavoidable, and any way far fewer because of his strong measures. He will say that Democrats open borders, and Russian hoax and impeachment caused the pandemic by blocking him from governing. He will claim that only he and his administration can protect us going forward. He will say that Democrats are evil because they are happy people are dying every day and hope the numbers go up. He will say that the healthcare system is a product of all past failed administrations, not him. He will say and he will say. But this is his calamity. His legacy. The subject of the first sentence of his obituary. Trump has wrecked the country through his ineptitude and ignorance. The cratering of the US economy is his fault and his fault alone because he hollowed out the government and left us exposed and vulnerable. Nothing he says will change this. Ever."
2020-03-18 03:49:03,"Americans, besides dealing with the immediacy of the event, need to ask themselves why did they tolerate the normalization of this person as president by the media and much of the country?

Think long and hard Americans.  Get the young off their phones and ask THEM to think about all of it.   Even when the Coronavirus threat subsides, America is on the skids.  This is the real deal finally.   And the country is taking a huge nosedive economically as an aside.  Human life comes first.  Trump could not care less."

The toadies that surround him?  The blank-eyed obsequious Pence?  What sickness do they suffer from?

The impeachment process, as necessary as it was, left him feeling omnipotent, and them more craven. Last week's hoax becomes this week's pandemic, and not one of his supporters choke on the words.

In Autumn 2016, before the election he was meant to lose, this joke was circulating:
Q: How dishonest is Donald Trump?
A: In December, if you ask him how he lost the race for president, he'll swear he never ran.

So there's nothing new here... except this time, people will die. 

The man never was, isn't, and never will be up to the job he (""like a miracle"" -- a horrible, dystopian miracle) now holds. One of my karma fantasies about Donald Trump is that the only vote he gets in the 2020 election is his own."
2020-03-18 02:15:15,"Trump is constitutionally incapable of thinking about anything but himself. He is one of the great narcissists in history.

America is turning on him."
2020-03-18 02:36:01,"Yes, it's another sad, pathetic lie. But what's sadder is that pointing out the truth won't make much difference. He'll keep repeating it and repeating it and repeating it. Fox News and the other members of the right-wing press will take their cue from that and scrub every reference to his earlier statements from their archives. By June half the country will believe he saw the virus coming long before those ""low-IQ doctors with their liberal university degrees"" and will dismiss any mention of the facts as Trump Derangement Syndrome."
2020-03-18 02:10:08,Trump’s admission is well beyond benign neglect. It makes his decisions to mislead the American public and withhold federal resources tantamount to depraved indifference. Who will hold him accountable for his the consequences of his malfeasance?
2020-03-18 03:07:06,"Simple, delusional. His narcissism does not allow him to confront reality. Doesn't pay attention to what he is being told, he doesn't read the memos, everything explodes in his face, it was not his fault, things get worse by the minute, and then he said that he knew everything right from the start. While the rest keep cleaning the mess. He sounds like many bosses that I had during my working life; worst part is that after the crisis passes, that boss will benefit with a bonus or a promotion.

But his presentation today which can be found on line was excellent. It was hard not to see  his adult, reassuring, measured and unifying message favourably in comparison to Trump's ranting self-serving prevaricating ramblings. It would do you good to remember how a leader is supposed to behave
* He kept 6 feet away from his medical spokesman on a separate podium
* He thanked the opposition leader and the leaders of state governments run by the opposing party
* He did not bad mouth anybody
*He did something Trump can't do with a straight face- he reprimanded panic buyers as being selfish
* He provided a sense of hope for the country and a sensible probable time line
* He did not call the virus Chinese
It is worth looking at as a contrast to the fumbling mass of crass prevaricating indulged in by individual 1 the un-indicted co-conspirator masquerading as as a president."

It would be useful to do a daily comparison of the coronavirus news and its counterpart on these other outlets.  

Now that Trump has, for some unknown reason, decided to perhaps credit a British worst-case scenario and thereby go over to the side of his detractors, we need to see how quickly and completely his trumpistas follow his lead and how creatively they portray and attempt to mask his changes in position.  Besides, it is always fun to watch purveyors of alternate reality tiptoeing through the minefield of facts and losing a foot or a leg every so often.  Unfortunately, the limb always grows back."

Lots of others - most, I should say - in the public eye are accused of being wishy washy or hypocrites, or some other negative personality trait when they reconsider their positions. Trump is inspired by the hard work of his team, whom he respects, and the sincerity of both Republicans and Democrats in their joint effort to address the travail of all Americans at this time and other people of the world.

He has none of the qualities needed to lead the battle against this pandemic. There is a need for a Rooseveltian big government approach to deal urgently with the public health aspects and the economic consequences of the pandemic.It must at the minimum give 3000 dollars a month to those affected and  have a moratorium on debt payments, rent, car loans, and credit card until the crisis  ends. Otherwise the second Great Depression will ensue. 
The army must build hospitals with ICUs and vital respirators available. This requires urgent leadership!

He did slip into some salesmanship type characterizations of aid packages ""Bold"" and beautiful?  And he did not tell the truth about his prior assertions.  

But he is now on the same page as the rest of the world's leaders. And he did reveal that which I did not know regarding China's leadership's false accusations against the US as having actually caused the epidemic and inference that we intentionally infected China!, And he did give credit to others, remarkably not for their Republican affiliations but rather for their work on ending the epidemic ( in the US, only). 

President Trump was professional, informative and displayed a grasp of the dangers of this epidemic.  He did not plagerize Macron exactly, but close to it.  The world is at war with a virus. 

So, President's Trump's nature is to always sell big.  We all knowthat by now.

This will result in less number of patients requiring ICU and even ventilator. In the process freeing up these resources for patient from neighboring city/county and so on. This is the process by which you will flatten the curve nationwide. This is what Dr Fauci is trying to communicate.

My heart hurts for all of the kids being raised by their grandparents who stand to lose their primary caregivers, and my heart hurts for America in general. I will shed many tears over those things. But I will not shed one drop when these men are voted out or removed by other means, and I simply no longer care how it happens.

My family was in the hotel business for 30 years and pioneered a 4 star hotel in the city we reside in.

And hoteliers tend to be overly defensive and aggressive after a while when the mounting costs and operations just don't bring in the revenue or even all that praise which got used to in the very initial days and when all that the owners and managers do is just criticise any guests or staff who point out the flaws and make known any real concerns or make complaints.

Trump is just like that.

This is no politician of any standing whatsoever.

The sooner America goes back to seasoned politicians the better."
2020-03-18 01:54:38,"From the inauguration on, there’s  never been any reason to trust donald and his administration. trump’s regrettable presidency has been the most sinister. deceitful and manipulative in this country’s history. Why would anyone suddenly trust trump about the worldwide Coronavirus crisis. While people in Asian countries have worn face masks to prevent spread of disease, trump and his people insisted Americans didn’t need face masks to cover up the fact that we were terribly under stocked with face masks. There still remains a horrific shortage of COVID-19 test kits and testin capacity. I believe nothing from trump, pence or anyone else connected to his administration. If I get sick, I’ll go the the ER and do what the MDs and nurses tell me to do. trump has always been a less than worthless human being, never more so than now."
2020-03-18 05:26:47,We all know Trump was calling it a hoax when he needed to be gearing up to fight this virus. Trump is going to try to play catch up now that our lying eyes ain't closed any more. We in this time of crisis want to think he has finally realized this isn't a reality show and that people live or die by his actions.Trump is  months late and Trillions short. Trump is going to be Trump but for the life of me I can't understand his party. Pence's daily required  platitudes of his Great Leader has become nauseating. Watching Trump when Pence is doing his Great Leader act speaks volumes about Trump.When Pence is telling us Trump can walk on water Trump's demeanor tells me he really believes it.
2020-03-18 05:55:51,"I'm quite sure most of us realized about 3 years ago--if not longer--to ignore most of what comes out of the Trumps's mouth. Yet another article along these lines isn't a particularly great use of news space, other than perhaps to re-iterate the need to look for leadership elsewhere these days."
2020-03-18 05:45:10,"Telling the truth certainly hasn't helped him get to where he is today so why, short of embracing his recently acquired religious belief, would anyone think he would start?"
2020-03-18 05:06:48,I knew that he would claim that at some time.  The man knows no truth.
2020-03-18 05:45:12,"How can the scientists and doctors, whom he drags in as the chorus to what has becoming his daily floor show, stand there and listen to the constant refrain of self-congratulatory lies? They must want the curtain to come down quickly on this sorry spectacle—but then the buck does stop with them in the Trump White House."
2020-03-18 05:05:16,"Ok, let's say for the sake of argument that Trump is telling the truth when he said that he knew that it was a pandemic.

So what does that say about his actions, his mind set and his moral compass?

It says he was complicit in the spread of the pandemic because he knew, and did not take appropriate measures - knowing that it was a pandemic. Worst than that, his pronouncements that it was a hoax and that it was nothing to really worry about encouraged an overwhelming spread of the virus, which will result in the costs being much higher and the number of dead Americans to be much higher.  

So why did this ""stable genius"" lie in such a dangerous fashion?

Because, losses on the stock exchange and a recession in the wings would be bad for HIM.  So, your lives were less important to President Trump than stock prices.  I suppose I should be shocked, but we have seen variants on this theme in the Trump mindset from Day 1 of his presidency. It is just in the case of COVID-19 it is blatant and directed at Americans, because in his mind you don't matter as much as power and money."
2020-03-18 04:25:03,As the saying goes: A country gets the government it deserves.
2020-03-18 05:01:51,"Why didn't any of the reporters ask Trump a follow-up question about his 'I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic' remark? I don't understand why the American press isn't far more critical of Trump whenever something like this happend (ie daily). How can all those reporters just sit there and politely nod their heads when their President is lying right in front of them? The only thing I read now, is how Trump has apparently 'changed his tone' - and that is not the full story."
2020-03-18 04:08:36,"FDR: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Truman: The buck stops here.

2020-03-18 06:10:09,"Trump's state of mind leading up to today --  whether he ""felt"" it was a pandemic or not -- makes no difference. 

If Trump knew this was a pandemic and serious, then he lied to the public. If he did not learn that it would soon be a pandemic, then he was not listening to his  from his teams of experts.

Either way, there is no excuse. As president he has flunked every serious test of leadership."
2020-03-18 06:09:26,Books will be written about this man for years to come..

2020-03-18 05:24:25,"“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”

Translation: Experts were telling me it was a pandemic long before I was willing to publicly call it a pandemic--and I was vaguely aware that they were correct as I lied through my teeth to the American public."
2020-03-18 04:09:44,"Do not engage with the ""so he knew"" rhetoric. It is clear he didn't. Discussing it as if he did plays into that narrative. 

Trump fired the pandemic response team, called the virus a hoax, then called it the ""foreign"" coronavirus in a thinly veiled attempt to unite his base under his nationalistic brand of authoritarianism. 

He didn't take it seriously. Do not engage with the ""if you knew, then why didn't you do XYZ?"" questions; instead, reject this statement flat out."
2020-03-18 04:09:09,If one was to believe this statement then he committed an impeachable offense by ignoring it and not protecting the nation.

We now live in a ""1984"" world. We have to decide if we want to keep living in that world."
2020-03-18 01:00:42,"Trump predisposed the entire Midwest to scoff at the seriousness of the virus, and having just traveled through Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, they're not yet serious about taking precautions.  He's and Fox News are going to be responsible for the deaths of a lot of his supporters.  I think when our cities are over the peak, we'll see a second later peak in flyover country."
2020-03-17 23:56:21,"At this point there is only one question I would ask this person in all seriousness: ""Is there any subject under the sun that you are *not* willing to lie about? Even when it can be proven that you are lying?""

Unfortunately, we know the answer all too well."
2020-03-18 04:46:45,"Of course he did and I'm sure he also knows ""the day"" it will end; BAK, what he doesn't know is the day of his last day in the White House, it'll be a surprise and now one will pay for his taxi fare home wherever that is.  So to be fair, this is the only country with two types of viruses, the Trumprus and the Coronavirus unfortunately the first one is making the effect of the second one worse, however the second one could get us ""the serum"" to rid of the first one."

Cotton has in the past criticized benefit programs and voted against disaster relief bills. 

Wow, Tom Cotton has turned socialist!  Armageddon has definitely arrived."
2020-03-18 02:21:34,"Maybe the real reason so many despise Trump (and his core) is that, in a real sense,  he honestly shows us in clear view how despicable all politicians are.

Perhaps we don't want to admit it about those who promise (there's a joke) to support those issues we, at the moment, think are important to each of us. And then those we put our faith in never fail to leave us hanging.  But not very deep down we knew it all along and we do know what they are all made of, and it's not something soft you want to step in. Trump by being Trump forces us to face it without blinking.  Ask yourself, is this really the best our country can do? It may well, and sadly, be."
2020-03-18 03:54:52,"Donald Trump's mind-bogglingly incompetent handling of the coronavirus has resulted in a worsening of the pandemic that is hitting our economy, communities, and individual lives in shocking ways—and it should destroy any last shot at his winning a second term, if anyone is paying attention."
2020-03-18 04:32:51,The sad truth is that Trump can’t ever be taken at his word. As was once said about Lillian Hellman: every word she says is a lie including and the. Donald Trump didn’t for a minute know that a pandemic was on the horizon. He probably doesn’t know what a pandemic is.
2020-03-18 06:05:34,I knew it all along. He just wanted to keep it lively and surprise us.

However, it is rich to hear the older generation deal with an existential crisis and rely on millennials to help fix it.  Multiple concessions demanded from travel, starting/continuing careers, or everyday life.  Then spending mass amounts of money to try to solve/alleviate it.  
Then when we ask for money or concessions to battle the fight of our lives in climate change, it's deemed too expensive, not the right time. or people just not believing the science.  

I hope the older generation will pay back the favor when all this is over."
2020-03-18 06:40:02,"No nation was prepared for the coronavirus. No one had the right systems in place, the right infrastructure, the right interpretation of what was happening, the nimbleness and intelligence to act wisely. The international structures were not in place either. Plenty of mistakes were made. In some cases knowledge was suppressed and people were persecuted. Trump came along slowly, with some bluster and resistance, but he also slowly realized that this was beyond him and that he would have to adapt and think of his leadership in a different kind of way. We are watching this evolve now. It is worth remembering that while Trump was starting to deal with the virus, the opposing Party was still staging his impeachment. In the President's recent change in tone, and in his obvious respect for the team working on the pandemic, there is an opportunity for a new kind of leadership and cooperation."
2020-03-18 06:45:30,Trump has been winning rhetoric arguments but he can’t win in scientific arguments. This time he will pay for it for putting the lives and well being of Americans at great risk. For sure he will pay back at the polls in November.
2020-03-18 06:54:24,"I read Orwell's 1984 soon after it came out. It was a prescient warning of how a totalitarian government could regiment its citizens, particularly by using technology. But its central theme was the regime's command of history, partly through the Ministry of Truth where the protagonist worked. It was often necessary to turn history's facts on their head to conform to the current needs of Big Brother."

2020-03-18 08:50:30,"Trump got off to a slow start. But when the need for emergency measures was clear, he took the initiative pretty much as needed. And now we are where we need to be. He has spurred drastic isolation measures and economic stimuli and he has put the country in the hands of our leading medical experts. On the whole, his accomplishments have substantially outweighed his failures.  And, indeed, he has demonstrated his respect for science."
2020-03-18 08:59:34,"Many readers seem to believe that Trump is sincere when he says he knew it was a pandemic. No, he did not know. Scientists around him did know, but he didn't WANT to know or listen. Actually, I am pretty sure that a week ago he did not know what a word ""pandemic"" means.

Greetings from the center of the epidemic."

This city is literally a medical mecca, where we have a large hospital with a trauma center, also a branch of the Mayo Clinic plus a Mayo hospital and literally hundreds of specialty physicians.   Because of my age, eighty, a recent urinary tract infection, arthritis, asthma and a total hip replacement in December, I thought while I was there, I would prudently ask for the corona virus test.  Guess what?  Even though our strange leader in Washington, claims there are tests available for all, my doctor said he didn't have any, nor could he tell me when they might receive the kits, although they had requested them daily for more than a week.  And we have a large population of senior citizens - an especially vulnerable group from what I read."
2020-03-18 08:49:28,"The trump administration over the last three years has been drastically cutting budgets and gutting public health agencies, eliminating preparedness teams, and abruptly  dismissing expertise.  There was a pandemic czar and an office full of experts that worked at the highest levels of our federal government that had been running trainings and exercises, ensuring national pandemic stockpiles, modeling possible outcomes, organizing collective response and communication channels, and planning for the execution of these plans. But the nation was left totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" as trump deliberately dismantled all the important measures Obama had taken to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future."

I'm sure Trump's followers will excuse this and dismiss this as fake news, even with video evidence, since one of Trump's main points is accusing the free press guaranteed by the 1st Amendment of being the ""enemy of the people"". 

I also think the economy wouldn't be so bad off if Trump had taken this seriously from the start. Yes, there would still be issues but it went from ""everything is good"" to ""this is super serious"" overnight. I bet the South Koreans are going to recover from this better than anyone because their pandemic response teams are so good at finding clusters and quarantining people that they don't have to do as much social distancing and more businesses stay open."

2020-03-18 08:48:55,What is unsettling is that the President's followers are agreeing that Trump was prescient and showed great leadership in not encouraging panic. They are all shifting gears along with him scornful that anyone would see a contradiction. Anyone who thinks his supporters will desert him in November has been too deep in self-isolation. Anyone who thinks otherwise and that Trump endangered the rest of us by his dithering better be showing up at the polls to vote blue no matter who.

First, we need to know how long it will take to get a viable vaccine.

When we know that, then we can make a plan.  We have to plan for that outcome.  We’re going to create a vaccine.

We have people saying this will cause a huge depression.  We know that isn’t acceptable.  How do we know that?  We know that economic depression costs lives.  Lots of lives, tangible and intangible.  But how many lives compared to those that could be lost with this virus?

We’re going coordinate with the CDC and others to know the timeline for vaccine viability, which is the time when the vaccine can hold off the virus long enough to keep things working normally in the economy.

Many people will die.  The reality of lives lost must be quantified by the CDC.

We’re going to reopen the economy to normal activity based upon their numbers combined with our knowledge of the effects of a shutdown on the economy.

The worst case is that this should affect the economy about the potential number of lost lives, which is about 1%.  But we can’t be acting effectively if we cause damage beyond that, which a total shutdown currently does.

We can project that a 1% loss of life is tragic, and that it will cost the economy maybe 1.5% as a result, but we have to go on.

So after this initial shutdown, we’ll reevaluate.

We can't lose more than 2% of the economy to protect 1% of the population.  It would be irresponsible to do so.

A good president would say such."
2020-03-18 09:20:25,Trump's decisions for the U.S. to self-quarantine from China (the China travel ban announced on January 31) and from the EU (the travel ban announced on March 11 after the epicenter shifted) suggest that Trump did early see this as a matter of significant moment.  Trump also did try to finesse that view with words apparently designed to avoid a national overreaction.  Trump's words trying to calm things do not necessarily indicate that he didn't recognize the peril early on.

But step in immediately when Trump downplays the risk, lies or in any other way slap Trump down - not a chance.

Oath of Office ignored.  Hippocratic Oath ignored.  Why does it take any oath?  Step up.  All that Adams, Pence, and the rest risk are their jobs.  Their timidity risks our lives."

 Of course it's beyond the pale unconscienable for him to mislead us about the imminent danger confronting our health and safety, and that of our friends, family and neighbors.

But we can take him to task after we get through this crisis. For now need to be grateful that he has finally 'made the pivot' to at least acting like he cares, and is getting out of the way of those professionals who are working so hard to protect us all, and not just the voters in The Red States of America.

They will believe that he with great vision saw the problem, calmly lead the country, and took care of them. Oh, and the stimulus he is now touting, which was not what he pushed for originally (he wanted payroll tax cuts) and the relief in the bill the House Democrats already passed? He will get credit for all of that, too, as they continue to sneer about ""do nothing Democrats."" Their world is fixed; the center of their universe is Trump, who shines like the sun.

Just deny you messed up, lied, and cheated, then accuse the other side of an unreasonable hatred of 'Us and Our Leaders'.  Continue to self deal, grease the palms that count, and repeat.

And still, after all of this, there will be millions who continue to appreciate Trump’s “honesty” and his willingness to “stick it to the experts” that were mucking things up with their professionalism and general competence. 

None of this article is the least bit of a surprise. Of course he would bungle the response and then claim that it was beautiful. He will continue to do so.

And Putin was careful to not affect Mother Russia. But for what purpose? Simply to make war on the world's economy and to improve the chances of Trump having a second term by his saving the US from a recession and having more of the Russian/Trump alliance. Could Putin be that clever? Many beers were raised to that idea at St. ELmo's."

2020-03-18 09:42:52,"And when he halted flights from Europe, he was criticized for that, too."
2020-03-18 08:24:24,"The most tragic part is that, supported by his propaganda machines, his base will likely believe his latest lie and distortion. 

Perhaps, as his base falls sick, one by one they may see more clearly how much Trump completely bungled the US response from not preparing tests or supporting the CDC warning. 

Doubt it though."
2020-03-18 04:34:02,"There is literally no bottom to the enemy domestic which is Donald Trump. 

At this point, there is so much recorded evidence of his pathological lying, self-contradicting, and sociopathic utterances that it should be no problem to produce a greatest hits reel demonstrating the true nature of this monstrosity (as if we didn't already know). 

Now back that with say a billion or two from Michael Bloomberg to pound the airwaves in all the battleground states throughout September and October."
2020-03-18 09:38:03,"Yes, Trump is once again ""rewriting history."" But this is another time could use plainer, stronger, more accurate words like ""lying,"" ""blatantly lying,"" ""egregious lies,"" etc. What's wrong with that? Maybe a reread of Orwell's ""Politics and the English Language"" is in order."
2020-03-18 05:18:50,I will never forget that yesterday Trump told state governors clamoring for respirators from the national stockpile to first look elsewhere. He also made the number of respirators in the stockpile classified information. This is literally the worst yet: Medical professionals on the front line who could die from exposing themselves to the virus don't know how many respirators are available. How on earth can they be expected to expose themselves and their families to a potentially lethel virus and not know if they will have the tools they need to save the patient? This is absurd. They are not the military. They are private citizens stepping up. They need to know what tools they have.
2020-03-18 09:02:37,as long as the headline of what Trump says presumes accuracy he can keep the lies going indefinitely. only when the media stops reporting as if he is honorable will things change.
2020-03-18 09:21:45,"Perhaps the most ironic and perverse fact of our times is that Donald J. Trump arose from something called ""reality"" TV to claim the title of President of the United States.

Do reality and integrity even matter to his supporters anymore?"
2020-03-18 06:00:29,"I have enormous respect for Maggie Haberman's reporting skills, but Trump made a ""remarkable assertion"" and ""abrupt pivot""? 

How about lies? Deception? Manipulation of the truth?"
2020-03-18 07:38:41,"Pants on fire.  if he sends $1,000 in blatant  vote-buying, we will endorse over to Biden.  This administration did not know panoramic or how to spell it, as Trump's sole conviction has been that science is bad if Obama thought it was good, and what is good for Trump is ALL that matters."
2020-03-18 06:29:20,"My President is now President Joe Biden. 
He is a good man, an honorable man and a truthful man.  He has been tested both personally and politically in ways that would fell lesser men.  
I know deep in my heart that he would never hold his personal interests to be more important than his own selfish interests.  That is my President.  
Because my President would never put millions and millions of American lives at risk simply to try to burnish his own disgraceful image.  
Because my President would never tell lies and spread dubious information that would cause at risk elderly Americans to treat a deadly virus so casually that huge numbers may well become infected and die because of it.
Because my President would have taken emergency action immediately upon having been made aware of the urgency of the situation before this virus took hold and destroyed both livelihoods and lives, families and friends, and the poor and the homeless.
That’s why my President is President Joe Biden."
2020-03-18 08:56:15,"Trump and his allies have tried to downplay this virus from the start.
Trump only came around to realizing the magnitude of our crisis in the last day or two.  Mostly due to his insistence on the stock market as the only measure of how well he is doing as president.  I never expected much else from him, honestly. The market crashed and Trump thought he could still turn it around by barking his usual pro-business platitudes.  Then the Fed slashed rates down to practically nothing just as Trump had always wanted and it did nothing for the market.  Now he has no idea what to do to get the market to go back up, and as that is his only measure of self-worth, it has destroyed him.  His aura of invincibility is gone."
2020-03-18 07:22:28,"Why didn't any of the reporters call him out on this boldface lie immediately while he was at the lectern? Trump has no respect for the office he holds, why should anyone respect him?"
2020-03-18 08:14:51,"We need journalists to keep Trumps's hypocrisy front in centre and not let it be swept under the carpet. 
Politicians of all parties bend the truth but Trump's lies are on an entirely different scale.
Journalists don't have to re4sort to slander or excessive partisanship to do their duty."
2020-03-18 08:25:03,"I guess the reason articles like this are written is to inform people of this man's mental instability. I would have thought this was a well known fact by now. On the other hand, for the few that are unaware or basically uneducated (his fans), this may make a difference when it's time to vote. Keeping fingers crossed..."
2020-03-18 09:59:48,The trump brand and facade of wealth have been served well by lying and boasting throughout his entire. Why in the world would he stop now?
2020-03-18 07:39:16,"Actually, I do not want to know what Trump thinks and I do not want to see or hear him. Most people, I am sure, feel the same way."
2020-03-18 09:44:38,"The first patient was in January. At that point, contact tracing has to begin. Who he was in touch with for the two weeks, which is a lot of people. When contact tracing was not done, as it was not taken seriously by Trump and his incompetent team, the virus is already loose in the community.That was what happened in Wuhan. Singapore, my country, Taiwan, HK and South Korea had learnt from SARS. USA learnt from H1 91. We applied our learnings. What happened to yours? This is dangerous and unfair to your population. I think it is a point of no return. And I fear, it will come around again and haunt my shores too. And I hope many Americans see this as unacceptable leadership and find someone more qualified. I just can't listen to his twisting and turning of scientific facts any more."
2020-03-18 08:18:11,"“i feel the tone is similar but some people said it wasn’t “
Some people?  Would that be all people?"
2020-03-18 08:22:05,"No, he didn't re-write history. I think having watched the situation in China his gut could see a pandemic coming. He just made a poor judgement call as to how he would go about lying through the situation. Ultimately he gave up on the lie thing once he discovered that continued lying would cost him his job. Again, it's all about him."
2020-03-18 06:23:17,How long before Trump declare the emergency so severe that he must suspend the 2020 election?
2020-03-18 07:05:08,"I think in U.S. most prestigious news organizations are doing a great job reporting on the Covid-19, informing the public internationally. However a society functions the best when the government actively reacts on the issues reported by the press and take actions accordingly. I don’t see that happening in America right now. I am thankful that The Times has been reporting from China, as we know that this is The Times webpage is where to get some true information. While Trump as your leader keeps calling genuine reporting as ‘fake news’ and not reacting accordingly when the nation faces a crisis, and lying in front of everybody’s face. Still, I feel sad that he is not held accountable for what he has said and done. I thought things like that happen in China, where there is no freedom of speech."
2020-03-18 07:08:31,This isn’t funny. But for once I’d like to hear some loud ironic laughter from people in the gallery when says stuff like this. Vs everyone standing there silently with this look on their faces that say “did .. did he really say that?” Imagine if one of the people behind him just said HA HA HA HA!
2020-03-18 06:33:18,"“It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”.... that seems fairly definitive that he is lying now. However, I suspect than in a day or two many MAGA’ts will be repeating that Mr Trump knew all along that it would be a pandemic."
2020-03-18 08:19:44,All of Trump’s public statements consist of nothing more than throwing virtual paper towels at the virus and the coming recession.
2020-03-17 23:11:20,"And his supporters, who were shouting ""hoax"" a week ago, will believe him."
2020-03-18 01:53:21,"If he knew it, then he's guilty of manslaughter.  In his position, he did everything he could to stop the process of getting ready. Criminal."
2020-03-18 03:03:48,What I find even more baffling than Trump is how my own father thinks Trump is God’s gift to the world.
2020-03-17 23:52:47,"I have another:

""America: I have only one request. Come November, think about and realize who failed you.""

Get your flu shot. A lot more Americans will die from the flu next year than will die from the coronavirus. At the moment, for example, 101 people have died in the US from the coronavirus, and roughly 18,000 have died from the flu."
2020-03-18 03:26:02,"Of course, President Trump ""Now Claims He Always Knew the Coronavirus Would Be a Pandemic""

Regarding the Covid 19 outbreak -- at the Centers for Disease Control -- he also told us:

""I like this stuff.  I really get it.  People are surprised that I understand it.  Every one of these doctors said, “How do you know so much about this?”  Maybe I have a natural ability.  Maybe I should have done that instead of running for President.""

I agree! 

I think Donald Trump should have gone to medical school rather than running for President.

A person might reasonably wonder if he would have completed medical school, but Mr. Trump is confident. As he says: ""I'm a very stable genius""."
2020-03-18 03:39:35,This would be funny if it were not tragic.
2020-03-18 00:11:19,"America has to look itself in the mirror - and what you get is ... Trump. Maybe for another four years, if for some reason the other seventy year olds don't work out. You could have someone like Tulsi Gabbard for President.  A strong, smart woman in the prime of her biological and political life. A normal American."

2020-03-18 06:09:27,"I just spent the last three hours with anxious back and forth calls between me and my kid in Australia--whose friends were all telling him his mandated return flight Monday is cancelled.  (Some of them had been on it.) NO online indication from United that this was true, 3 hour wait for an agent at 2 this morning.  I THINK I've succeeded in switching it to Friday but who knows if that flight's for real either?  SO angry and FED UP with this so-called-president's lies.  He is a sick, sick, mind that the GOP should've seized the day to remove.  The next move is selling these same kids into national debt hock so he can hand out$1000 checks to placate the 45% that unfathomably still believes he's fit to govern."
2020-03-18 09:30:47,Of course the Very Stable Genius but by also being a virus expert he did not want to confirm it until tests verified he was right.
2020-03-18 05:16:56,"Trump is such a stable genius!  Of course, he knew all the answers, as we have witnessed by his lack of leadership!"

He says he knew it was a pandemic but trivialized it and was indifferent to the devastation it would cause to the lives of Americans."
2020-03-18 03:46:40,What's worse? That Trump thought it was a hoax or that he thought it was a pandemic but called it a hoax?
2020-03-18 00:22:01,Given Donald’s attention span 15 minutes is effectively “always”.
2020-03-18 01:01:56,"It is not necessary for his followers to believe the Main Stream Media. They don't have to switch to MSNBC or read the Times or WaPo. They don't have to turn to Rachel Maddow for the analysis. All they have to do is remember what he has been saying on Fox News and in his tweets for the last few weeks. His own words convict him of lying and incompetence. 

Is there a conspiracy to destroy him? Only if he has been conspiring with himself against himself."
2020-03-18 02:10:15,Someone should document and publish what Trump have said and done since January as a historical record for later generals to learn the truth.

1. WHY? Because infections are increasing, people are dying, and investors are panicking
2. WHY? Because the COVID19 pandemic is out of control
3. WHY? Because we weren't prepared... even though other countries provided warning and response models  
4. WHY? Because in 2018 this administration fired the people responsible for preparing and despite growing evidence of the real risk (e.g., deaths in other countries, infections increasing in the U.S.) our “leaders” actively minimized the threat instead of accelerating a serious response 
5. WHY? Trump"
2020-03-18 05:59:39,"So much for “ . . . preserve, protect, and defend . . . “ which we knew from the moment he parroted the words were to him just that, words without meaning."
2020-03-18 06:43:59,"I think that if everyone heeded all the sagacious advice to panic and act like they're close to death, the entire world would be sitting at home fiddling on their laptops, with everything shutting down and playing it safe. It's ridiculous. We're lucky farmers don't let everything rot in the fields, afraid to drive to market, or that nurses don't refuse to go to their hospital. Sorry! Life has to go on to some degree."
2020-03-18 07:08:14,"Trump is only reprogramming the minds of his herd.
 It has nothing to do with whether or not it's true or not.
Last night on Fox, Laura Ingraham was ranting that it was untrue that Trump disbanded the Pandemic Response Team.
Yesterday Trump said he was unwilling to use his authority to ramp up production of needed medical supplies.  In a few days, when the pandemic escalates, and 
 needed supplies are not available, Trump will deny he did anything the holdup those supplies.
It's terrible, but I really don't know if he's doing it out of ignorance, or he's trying to get even with the Governor's, whose competence in reacting to the crisis, has made him look like the fool he is."
2020-03-18 07:36:13,This is predictable and standard behavior from him.  His lips are moving = he is lying.   Why should this be any different?
2020-03-18 01:24:59,"Here’s the dangerous thing— what if he loses the election? Do you think a man like this will just admit he lost and leave peacefully? He’s willing to say that up is really down and that a square is actually a circle, and that anyone who disagrees with him is dishonest and wrong. He’s never admitted that he has ever been wrong.  His supporters will never stop supporting him either."
2020-03-18 04:19:35,"Me thinks enough ink has been spilled reporting about Trump's lies for years. I really am not in the mood, and would like to tune him out. Can the media help?"
2020-03-18 02:18:40,"Has Trump hoarded all the coronavirus tests in the White House basement? Does he get tested on the hour every hour after every meeting? 

Where are all of the tests? This is outrageous that people aren't being tested to slow down the spread of this pandemic."
2020-03-18 06:49:20,"It is no surprise that the ""president"" has made a 180-degree turn on the matter.  He does that so often that it's a wonder that he's not always dizzy and falling down.  What is surprising to me this morning is that nowhere on the front page of the New York Times Website have I found anything related to the Justice Department's sudden announcement that it is giving up on the case against Russians who interfered in the 2016 election.  Instead (and I understand why) I have found article after article after article after commentary after article about the corona virus, with a side note that there was a primary yesterday.  Under normal circumstances the Justice Department's decision to just give up this case would be big news.  I'm looking forward to the day when that will once again be the case.  Thank you, NYT, for the work that you do!"
2020-03-18 04:37:15,"Really, he knew it was going to be a pandemic? Hasn’t Trump been telling us it is nothing, everything is under control, if he did, why didn’t he act fast and decisively, the man is crazy."
2020-03-18 07:17:24,"Of course he did. Ask any of the 37% of his worshippers and they will confirm not only did he predict the virus, he found the cure and identified the culprits who caused it. The proof is the cast of nodding heads lined up behind him like a row of American flags, congratulating him for his decisive leadership. If Democrats think that his criminal response which will cause widespread suffering will make him an easy target in November, think again. With the massive power of the presidency, a desperate Republican Party, Fox News, his devoted base and Trump is relentless to do everything to remake the world to fit his desires."
2020-03-18 00:04:24,"""Never let a crisis go to waste...""

Since this crisis has started, Trump has used the pandemic to:
attack Obama
attack immigrants/foreigners
attack the EU
attack China
literally attack Iran
threaten Social Security and Medicare
attack governors responding to the crisis
attack the media
with his Republican enablers, attack paid sick leave
and write a big check to Wall Street while claiming that working stiffs will be helped (hint: they won't)
The only one helping Donald Trump right now is Nancy Pelosi!  And the Senate Republicans are fighting that tooth and nail.

If only he had spent all that time and energy attacking the crisis at hand."
2020-03-18 01:12:15,"He even knew that it was a 'perfect pandemic'
Behind the scenes he's been working on the 'greatest vaccine'
Rest easy, people of the world. Our fearless Nero (sorry hero) is furiously working on tweeting (no meeting) with with his scientific peers!"
2020-03-18 00:51:38,"What's new for Trump is that he's dealing with an opponent where his remedies don't work. He can't insult him on Twitter to gather his own followers behind him via emotions and gut feelings. With the alleged ""Crooked Hillary"" this might work. But a virus can't be twittered out of the world and can't be stopped by any wall. This makes a cold stop in the USA on his world tour. Numbers of infected and dead people are not a matter of interpretation, they cannot be twisted into alternative facts. What no democrat, no impeachment trial and no celebrity has been able to achieve so far is now being created by a virus. It attacks or kills Trump's political style - and hopefully costs him re-election. Regards from Germany."
2020-03-18 01:50:48,"Even now, he's not really responding to the health crisis. His eyes are on the stock market alone. When the market rejects his lies, he has nowhere to hide."
2020-03-18 08:04:12,"There is a perfectly valid reason for Trump's denial of the CV crisis. In his mind, it simply didn't exist, his lackeys were unable to correct his delusion, so he blindly continued along obscuring all data that disagreed with his delusion.

While that perfectly good reason may explain Trump's behavior, it does not explain why our country hasn't removed this delusional man from office. Consider, how many times would a pilot deny there was a runway ahead and be allowed by his airline to keep flying? How many times would a doctor botch a procedure and be allowed by his hospital to continue as a surgeon?

Trump demonstrated he was unfit long before corona so the failure is ours for not acting sooner to remove him and his enablers from office. Even now, where is the ""hue and cry"" to remove this obviously disturbed person from power?"
2020-03-18 09:36:59,"Well, I am SO happy the President of the United States wants us to know that he, smart and clever he is, knew it is a pandemic already. Now I am wondering how this important statements is going to change or help with ANYTHING. 
I don’t get it how such an egocentric person achieved to be President. Maybe, the Job role president of the U.S. is not as impressive as It used to be. 
I wish Trump is just a mood of the nation. „Oh, I am feeling so trumped today... just wanna do mine, don’t care for others, yeah, all fine as long as my suite looks expensive...“"
2020-03-18 09:40:53,"Trump and his coterie have established firmly that anything said or done by him in public view doesn't count as crime. The public also accepts this view. Why is it now an issue that he recanted whatever he said about the virus earlier? Everything he said was public. And hence, by definition, he cannot have done or said anything wrong."
2020-03-18 03:08:03,"If Trump knew all along this virus would be a pandemic and ignored it for over a month from its first case in the U.S., his behavior as President rises up to the criminal act. He better sticks to his previous statements that he thought the virus would ""miraculously"" disappear if he wants to avoid criminal charge."
2020-03-18 06:34:03,Why would anyone be surprised by this?  Trump has lied his whole life and whenever he is confronted with it he doubles down.  Imagine what it must be like for his wives.  Still there are people in the country who think he is doing a good job.  There are none so blind as those who refuse to see.  God help us all.  We would’ve better off if Toonces the driving cat was at the wheel.
2020-03-18 06:59:08,"You have a very, very strange man occupying the White House. I am sure his reaction to having recently 'tested negative' for Covid-19 will be to quietly assume (then arrogantly announce) that he has preternatural immunity to all infectious diseases.
His conflation of phone call recordings and virus testing might, do you think, be due to the word that 'transcription' is a term sometimes used when discussing the RNA amplification techniques that are involved. So if viruses have 'transcriptions', and telephone calls can be 'transcribed', they must be similar. Or even the same. Hey - test people over the phone. Why has nobody else thought of that? Because he has a natural flair for all things scientific.

2020-03-18 03:49:13,"He knew it was a pandemic and then he deliberately lied to the American public in a desparate attempt to calm the stock market.   What did he tell his wealthy donors?  Get out of the market now, before the whole nation finds out?"

2020-03-18 02:42:40,"Of course he did.  That's why he's so easily able to say ""I take no responsibility.""  Even more disturbing is the fact that his loyal band of followers will both believe this ""remarkable assertion"" and accept it as the truth and absolve him of any blame for the tragic and eminently preventable spread of COVID-19 in the U.S."
2020-03-18 05:58:24,"So astounding to watch this man LIE, LIE, LIE, and his base doesn’t blink. Is it a mental illness or just plain evilness? I can’t help being amazed at how￼ easily he does it.

On another hand, I watched McConnell answer questions after his press conference today. He is usually such a dour person, and yet today he was downright giddy and laughing. It was almost as though he was ecstatic by the turn of events.

Between the two of them, it’s like living in the dimensions of the Twilight Zone."
2020-03-18 04:29:30,"In addition to the rest of his many shortcomings, he lacks the one most important for a president: judgment."

Thanks Stable Genius!"
2020-03-18 06:16:52,"This man CANNOT speak without lying, and without making ridiculous claims to make himself the hero of whatever the subject at hand.

It's all too obvious.  He must be removed from office."
2020-03-18 05:19:40,Ask him at what exact date he knew it was going to be a pandemic. Every time Trump makes a statement you have to make him back it up with numbers.
2020-03-18 00:44:51,"Every single person in the room knows he's lying.  Does he?  If the answer is no, that tells us he really isn't sane.  If the answer is yes, he glories in his ability to say whatever he wants without consequences."
2020-03-18 01:22:01,"We're entering the realm of self-parody. If it weren't so lethal, it would be laughable. Anyone in Trump's administration who enables this swamp-worthy flipfloppery should begin removing mirrors from their homes. And I suppose we can expect similar backpedaling from the right wing media sycophants at Fox and elsewhere. Republicans are twice as likely to go out and spread the infection because of the tainted media sources they consume."
2020-03-18 07:01:03,"Why would anyone believe anything this “man” ever says? The response to a global problem was delayed by weeks or months by their need to downplay or deflect it. How many US casualties will his ignorance/arrogance cost? 

Ironically the brunt of the administration’s failure will be born by their disproportionately susceptible supporters."
2020-03-18 01:15:53,"Trump continues lying to Americans.  We’ve witnessed the constant lying and corruption for over 3 years.   Now with the dire predictions from CoVID-19, back in May 2018, the Trump administration pushed to have designated part-time Infection Control positions in nursing homes to be cutback or eliminated, setting up dire risks for our most frail and vulnerable elderly population.  Pense announced during press conference of 3/3/2020 that it was a priority to keep seniors safe.

Trump’s buddy, Brian Ballard, works for the nursing home industry, did intense lobbying for these changes saying it would unfetter business and save the industry over $640 million a year.  Then another powerful lobbyist, Eliezer Scheimer, who owns many nursing homes himself and who donated $750,000 to Trumps campaign, pushed for more relaxing of regulations by pushing for dropping of infection control inspections from once a year to once every 2 years!!

Seema Vilma, administrator of Medicare went along with the new regulations to infection control and said, “it was about not about easing up on regulations but about not micromanaging the process”!"

And what is needed in times like this is a spirit of unified purpose and a readiness to let go of our bogeymen in order to direct our energies toward shared survival and healing. And yet, all one seems to find on the editorial pages of the Times is obsessive vilification of the President, something which serves no useful purpose other than to allow a particular echo chamber to congratulate itself. The fact is, at this moment - and in all likelihood for five more years - Donald Trump will continue to be America's commander in chief. At such times,  it is in the nature of citizens to increasingly support their president. By continuing to flog the same dead horse the Times will achieve nothing other than to make itself irrelevant as a shaper of opinion, if it hasn't already done so."

The “I don’t take responsibility at all” president’s efforts to downplay the disease could lead to tens or hundreds of thousands more serious cases and deaths. [HuffPost]

WASHINGTON ― What happens when the president of the United States tries to lie, wish and tweet a pandemic away?

As it turns out, it puts a government response four to six weeks behind schedule, resulting in hundreds of thousands more Americans dying.

Jan. 22, Trump claimed the disease was “totally under control,” that it was just in a single patient who had come from China. “It’s going to be just fine.”

Feb. 10,  virus was starting to spread in Italy & Iran, Trump told the nation’s governors : “A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat.”

Feb. 26, the day after a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that life in the United States was likely to change very quickly, Trump claimed that there were only 15 cases here, and that number would soon fall to zero.

Feb. 28, he called the virus the latest “hoax” that Democrats 
& media were using to hurt the economy and, in turn, his chances for reelection. Indeed, over the course of February, he spoke and posted on Twitter repeatedly that the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, had not killed as many as the seasonal flu and suggested that Americans should buy stocks.

2020-03-18 06:51:50,"The man has a serious, untreated mental illness - narcissistic personality disorder.  One of the symptoms is disassociation from reality and grandiose statements.  Apparently the GOP lives in the alternative reality universe because 74 percent believe what he tells them.  It's hard to believe that any sane person could believe that Trump is smarter than everyone because his uncle taught at MIT and he knew it would be a pandemic all along.  If they can't see that he's sick, God help this country if they re-elect him. Jim Clyburn hit the nail on the head in an interview with Axios when he said we are heading to a Germany of the 1930s."
2020-03-18 05:33:15,"Considering Trump's penchant for lies and clearly limited vocabulary that's always on full display in his Tweets, I'd bet my last nickel that he not only had never heard the word ""pandemic"" before three weeks ago, he had absolute NO idea what it meant.  Somebody must've miraculously gotten it into his head with a pictures of the hospitals packed with the sick and dying from all over the globe, because as we all know, his attention-span is that of a child and he retains NOTHING.  

This ""stable genius"" only listens to his ego, his sycophants and fellow GOP'ers.  His administration is now fully stocked with climate & science deniers, people willing to destroy everything our Constitution and country stand for all in the name of GREED and POWER.  

He only cares about this crisis because it threatens his re-election, which he based on a healthy stock market.  Now that that bubble has burst and with the virus still not even at peak levels here in the U.S., we could still be looking at a death toll in the tens or even hundreds of thousands when this first wave passes, including lots of his fan base still thinking it's ""just the flu"".

True, he did not create the virus, but his narrow-mindedness and EXTREME lack of intellect and leadership has lead us to this danger point - if this doesn't give pause to at least SOME of his voters and those angry enough about Bernie not being the Democratic nominee to threaten to vote for Trump, then this country is truly doomed."
2020-03-18 07:45:38,"Trump has taken bold and decisive action.  He has deferred to epidemiologists and virologists, as he should, on critical decisions.  He has surrounded himself with competent people who can help him make the decisions that will guide the country.  This criticism of him is entirely gratuitous.

Trump could cure cancer with his left hand and world poverty with his right and the left would still be frantically grasping at any excuse to tear him down."

Today when he pivoted from ""it's no big deal, over by April, we're doing great"" to ""he always knew it was a pandemic"" I felt real rage.  This fool worked hard behind the scenes to depress testing and to minimize an unfolding disaster.  Today he pretended to delegate actions to states who have taken action without him, in a vacuum of federal leadership.  Instead of concisely and clearly outlining a series of steps to unfold throughout the nation, he talks vaguely and defers to the states on each desperate need that is mentioned: not enough ventilators, not enough masks for health care workers; nowhere near enough beds in settings that will not spread the virus.  Where is the federal plan?  At every step, we are reacting, rather than being proactive.  And my god, what a toll we will pay shortly.   What he has done - or rather failed to do - is criminal.  Trump must be held responsible."

So, no need to call him out with these kind of articles—help the citizens and not with 'instant' money. Reminds me of 'W' handing out checks—is what is proposed going to have a lasting effect on the country's citizens where they will be able to not have to worry about the exorbitant cost of medical care—the proposed $1000—look at the price list that Representative Katie Porter produced for just the cost of having testing. What about those who do come down with the virus?—the Staff that are being worn out because of the urgency for more beds…sure, immediate gratification but when is it going to be about long term care so that our kids can thrive knowing that they don't have to grow old like we do worrying if we get the scourge of this virus that is totally blind to if you are white or black or brown, rich or poor, gay or straight."

Didn't play reams and reams of clips of Trump downplaying the risk, mistating the facts, and flat out lying.  They just played the clip.

It is indeed like  a miracle. The defining characteristic of miracles are that they are, without exception, fake claims. 

Every single miracle, including the miracle of blind, mindless faith in the likes of Trump and other self-proclaimed divinities, is that they are fake through and through. Of the thousands of gods, devils, pixies, and elves that infest the human world, there is but one common denominator: non-existence. 

Blindly putting your faith in the fantastic (literally fantastic) claims of absolute fakery is, however psychologically understandable, rarely the healthiest response to anything. However unpleasant it might be, a solid dose of reality is far more likely to cure the ills that confronts us, whether medical, social, economic or otherwise. 

Trump's inflated fakery has already done great harm. 

The true miracle made manifest here is the perfection of blind faith that so many have continued to accord him. 

If only we could be sure that he and his like would disappear. That might take a miracle."

The press, the NYT or any other version of 'the media' have to consider everything he says/does because of the office in which he squats.  They have to give every utterance endless credence until it is obvious there is none.

I don't have to; other members of 'the public' do not either.

Donald Trump does not care about this country or it's citizens and he does not care about learning anything in order to do a better job. 

His only real concern is to be re elected, not for any 'vision' of the country, not to avoid potential federal charges which his behavior has generated.

My mistake, he did close the borders down to China at the end of January but if he knew it was going to be a pandemic he needed to do many more things to intervene. 

Trump has the audacity to make this statement when there are thousands of people in America who have this virus or are carriers while many Americans die.  This admission is absolutely bizarre and an admission of not honoring his oath he took when he became President - to protect the American people!  This reminds me of the Ukraine Scandal when Trump was going to have Ukraine interfere in our 2020 Presidential election - again, not protecting the American people.

This man-child is 'damaged goods', no matter which way you look at.

2020-03-18 03:54:06,"Unfortunately, Trump might end up having the upper hand with 850 billion of our money to buy his way to a second term. This is what I call laughing all the way to the bank, hand in hand with McConnell and Madame Chao."
2020-03-18 00:31:35,"And the Supreme Court just announced that the decision to reveal Trump's tax returns...DELAYED...along with other decisions, because of the virus outbreak.

Transparency is what Democracy is made of.
Those taxes would reveal the real Donald Trump, of course, and what his hands have been into...
We have every right to demand the big reveal.
Because, yes, the Russians are involved. Mobster nation.
And their mobster banks. They know how to control a man.

We need to see those statements, and we need to make it happen BEFORE the election. Because he promises to cheat us out of a fair election, yet again! Yes, I am more than angry.
Let us be free of this, this demagoguery. Demand the Supreme Court to take action. What good is the division of power if they do nothing? Is America a democracy? Let us prove it."
2020-03-18 00:50:55,Trump fails again and he gives his base another lie. He didn’t see it coming until the states start taking precautions he then was convinced that we were losing the race and his fake economy was crashing fast.
2020-03-18 06:30:31,"So much on-the-record material to use in continuous play loops until November. Democrats, be ruthless and let Trump”s own words take him down."
2020-03-18 01:38:11,"I swear it was  only a few weeks ago I saw someone who looked exactly like trump claim it was a hoax, fake news, a Dem election ploy. Unbelievable resemblance."
2020-03-18 02:24:25,Those who understand trump's lies don't need to see the proof.  Those who believe his lies don't understand the truth.
2020-03-18 02:44:55,What worries me even more than the coronavirus pandemic is that 45% of Americans still believe that Trump is doing a good job!
2020-03-18 03:40:30,"Just when we most need national leadership to deliver facts and offer sober guidance, we're stuck with a president who lies as others breathe. Sickening that he's propped up by a chorus of enablers."
2020-03-18 05:23:34,"For him to say this with a straight face indicates an 
1. an abysmal lack of human empathy
2. an appalling display of ignorance, and 
3. clear-cut evidence of a deep moral emptiness.
Any one of these could be dangerous, even disturbing. To see all three in one person at the apex of American government is beyond frightening: it is sickening.

Should we be more frightened that he is so deeply sociopathic that he would allow a country and its citizens to be at risk as part of his personal ""joke"" or that he thinks so little of the citizens who he swore to protect and defend that he would laugh about their possible death, then lie about it to their face.  

The evangelical ministers and ""spiritual advisers"" around him (yes you, Robert Jeffress) are culpable...for his soul and our lives. 

Vote in November not like YOUR life depends on it...but as if the life of those you love best depend on it. Because guess what...it does."
2020-03-18 10:32:17,"So if he said he ""knew"" it was going to be a pandemic, he is either lying now, has been lying all along, or both.

He cannot help himself.  He HAS to lie.  He needs to make himself look presidential and competent, when he knows both are the furthest thing from the truth.

Now we must all suffer due to his lack of leadership, and some of us have, and will die."
2020-03-18 03:11:17,"As usual, Trump tells the lies that paint the world as his deluded supporters want to see it."
2020-03-18 05:39:47,Trump is toast now. Even the hard core Trump supporters of a football forum board I regularly post on have turned against him over the virus handling. Nobody trusts him or believes him anymore. If the election were today Biden wins in the biggest landslide in political history of this nation.
2020-03-18 01:53:18,"Trump is so typical of someone who does not believe in truth and democracy , hence for him attempting to rewrite history is just another average day."
2020-03-18 02:24:41,"Of course, he's a stable genius."
2020-03-18 02:31:12,Why don’t reporters in press conferences come with a list of his lies with dates and times and confront him with it in press conferences? They let him get away with this every time.
2020-03-18 07:41:53,"If the present WH resident only took a picture of one of his predecessors (any President) from the wall, placed it on the chair in the Oval Office, and left the room, there would be fewer contradictory statements and more competence and decency."
2020-03-18 09:34:18,he knew it and didn't say it so as to not cause a panicdemic. he remains optimistic as long as possible.
2020-03-18 02:01:58,He's unable to remember what he said back then.
2020-03-18 02:12:50,"The WHO test kits were not inferior. If they were, the top scientists would not have relied upon them. What a pathetic attempt to change the real story about disaster disaster the test kits and the roll out of testing by the CDC has been. Pointing fingers is a tell tale sign of their own campaign of deceit. All in a political attempt at spinning that the President and his administration has been on top of this."
2020-03-18 01:41:09,"If he knew it was a pandemic long before others, then his failure to warn others, his failure to take the bold actions needed to save lives, and his efforts to minimize the threat make him among the most evil leaders of all time.

Nero ain’t got nothin’ on The Donald."
2020-03-18 06:57:12,"He knew it was a pandemic before he knew it was a democratic hoax which was the best and most tremendous hoax, no it wasn’t a hoax! It was real and the Democrats said it was a hoax cause it was always a pandemic like trump said before he said the other thing that was right about everything that he said."
2020-03-18 03:06:55,"If there was any doubt before I think this week proves it - Trump is not well, mentally."
2020-03-18 03:59:32,Trump alone is responsible for this mess.  The minor players are the Republican members of Congress and Fox News.
2020-03-18 01:46:49,Le sigh. Trump is not the problem. We are the problem because almost half of us will ignore his incompetence and vote for him again. We are becoming a confederacy of dunces.
2020-03-18 06:50:11,"@ macduff15

""The way Trump's brain functions, and it is not a normal brain, he absolutely believes that what he just said is true. He's not trying to pull a fast one.""

Nah, he's trying to pull a fast one.  It's called ""lying."" And I wish the media would call it that instead of “remarkable assertion,” “claim” and other euphemisms.  We’re all adults.  We know a lie when we hear one.  

Vote Blue this fall.  And no third party candidates, please.  (We learned our lessons in 2000 and 2016.)"
2020-03-18 07:44:51,"He’s lied about everything his whole life, did he lie about his covid-19 test too?  Is that why it is suddenly a pandemic?  Why the sudden change of tune?"
2020-03-18 01:36:54,"In this case, I believe Trump. I believe he knew it was likely to become a pandemic. And supposing that fact a threat to his reelection, he then lied about his true feelings over and over again.

Both foolish and dishonest. The POTUS.

I think he could pass a polygraph with flying colors if asked, ""Did you believe it was going to become a pandemic by early February?"""
2020-03-18 02:59:57,"Where is Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC?  He has disappeared since he admitted to congress that some people had died of the virus even before the first official death was reported.  They were apparently misdiagnosed as dying from the common flu.  Has Trump thrown under the bus???"
2020-03-18 02:50:47,Really?  Then why didn’t he PLAN FOR IT??
2020-03-18 01:45:12,"Trump’s lies, covering up the very real harm he has done to the public, are disgraceful. 

What’s worse is that he knows people will believe his lies. 

If he is re-elected, we are in real trouble. 

Not just because he will fail in addressing the next crisis, but also because he would have in place machinery for the manufacture of lies and an electorate ready to receive them."
2020-03-18 04:42:19,"We just are not honest enough about Trump. The truth is he consistently and purposefully misleads the public. Purposely. These lies are not gaffes. They are lies designed to mislead and sway opinion. 

It’s wrong.  It’s dangerous.

We’ve got to get rid of him and the entire GOP.

Kick Trump to the curb on November 3rd."
2020-03-18 03:58:10,"Everyone commenting here is absolutely right to be horrified by Trump's constant, blatant lies. I wish they would also be horrified by Biden's. At the debate the other night he lied in response to every, single question. He played no part in writing the bankruptcy bill. Lie. He never said cuts to social security should be on the table. Lie. He didn't support the war in Iraq. Lie. He's always been completely pro-choice. Lie. I'm just wondering why we're so eager to nominate another liar -- remember when he had to drop out of a previous presidential race when he was caught plagiarizing others' speeches -- to compete with the liar-in-chief.  By next week every American with a brain will realize the necessity of socialism during a catastrophe. Money to bail out individuals or corporations, universal healthcare, paid medical and family leave. A social safety net that protects all of us, not just the billionaires. But by then we'll be stuck with Hillary redux, another corporate shill who has nothing to offer a younger generation hungry for change and the rest of us who finally understand what desperation looks like. Biden wants to return us to the sunny days of 2016. Don't let him. This catastrophe has to teach us that out-of-control capitalism is going to kill us all."
2020-03-18 04:25:43,trump just admitted that he knowingly committed a crime against humanity.
2020-03-18 10:36:02,"Same stuff, different day....and still I'm not sure who I loathe more, the man himself or the people who voted him in."
2020-03-18 10:36:26,"For three long years we have been suffering as a nation from the anxiety and stress caused by Trump’s behaviors. Piled on top of this dysfunction, we now have stress caused by the pandemic, which has an uncertain end date and outcome. On top of all of that, we have personal issues in our lives that cause stress. About six months after I had a severe case of pneumonia years ago, my hair started to fall out from the stress load put on my body. I can’t imagine the impact this triple mega whammy of stress and anxiety will have collectively on us as a nation. And if Trump is re-elected, or refuses to leave if not elected, we may just all descend into madness."
2020-03-18 03:34:48,"He's a flawed man in too many ways to measure. Yet he does at time have a logic, shocking as he may express it, it at times, makes more sense the the left tripping over themselves to go along with the most insane leftist ideology that no one agrees with. I will say he's stepping up and has changed his tone and seems more like a leader the past 48 hours. Something he should've have been doing for 48 months."
2020-03-18 09:41:53,"A doctor just said very cleverly...if he knew about this so brilliantly with fore knowledge...who was he informed by,why isn't that person coming forward or were they gagged,and why did he not act sooner?!"
2020-03-18 02:08:49,"What would you have him do? What would you have done differently?  I watched the two old white men duke it out softly on the ""debate"" Sunday. So all of you on the left think these has beens would/will be a better president than Mr. Trump. Your hubris is showing and it is not pretty. Mr Trump is not famous for his verbal exclamations but he generally does the right thing. Instead of accusing him of all the evil in the world, you could serve your country better by trying to pull together instead of contributing to the deepening divide. There is a virus in this country much more insidious and deadly than the corona and we all know what it is."
2020-03-18 03:52:58,"I think when a President of the United States wishes that American citizens  be imperiled by remaining on a cruise ship instead of disembarking to get the best medical care because he didn't want his  ""numbers"" to look worse in his ridiculous attempt to manipulate the Market, I think that says it all, and it  should be an irrefutable sign to his die hard followers that he is almost always up to no good."
2020-03-18 02:39:38,"The sudden presumed pivot of this amoral person in the White House is not really a pivot at all, since he’s now doing exactly what he loves to do best:  be the center of attention, be on stage, look like a leader, “large and in charge” - just as he does at his rallies with his faithful base.  It’s more fantastic than the narcissistic megalomaniac could ever have imagined:  hold court with the very industry CEOs who shunned him early in his administration, take credit for anything that might go right (although things going right seems less likely by the day), lay blame on sycophant Pence, and others on that stage whose robotic praise for him, plus facial expressions trained to freeze no matter what he says and, best of all, be in front of international media several times a day hanging on to his every word.  All that, and he doesn’t even have to travel to the hinterlands, on the road all day, pumping flesh with strangers.  He instead is hanging out in his robe, brainstorming with Fox “commentators” who tell him what to say, how to act, and how it will play with the base, and of course Tweeting and prepping for his closeups.  Hoax, lies and videotape, that’s what he lives for.  And Americans are dying because of it."
2020-03-18 02:55:02,"Stop writing stories like this.  It gives Trump cover.  Simply repeat and replay what he has said about the issue, over and over and over and over.  

Perhaps then, the truth will win out over the spin."
2020-03-18 02:23:38,"There is going to be the biggest money grab from Trump and his fat-cat pals, you just watch how it will go down.   With hundreds of billions of taxpayer money to be given out, you know that Republicans are licking their chops on getting the lions share.    Mean time, average Americans are going to be thrown some scraps and will be told shut up, make-do with it and be grateful.  (even though this money is taxes paid by hardworking Americans).

There will be minimal respirators, tests, hospital facilities, or planning or thought given on measures to save lives unless we force Trump and the Republicans to answer for every unnecessary death.   Their haphazard plans so far have made this crisis only worse.   Trump’s ego won’t let the medical professionals lead and he can’t stop himself standing at that podium controlling and blocking everyone."
2020-03-18 10:17:27,"As in Australia, for assured competence and resolute public prudence, America needs to reform its central administration to a collection of senates of expertise, professional law source and able military command.

2020-03-18 02:16:00,"Did we expect anything else? His pants are definitely on fire. 
Still can't get ""widespread testing"" in one of the medical meccas of the US.  Doubt he even knows how to tell the truth.

Doctors and nurses are getting sick. 
And yet those of us who remain asymptomatic still come to work every day. Because that's what we do. Some of us might be unknowingly spreading illness. THAT is not a lie."
2020-03-18 02:44:22,"This is a laughable lie, but odds are that Fox News and its ilk will join Trump in spreading it and that many in the Republican base will come to believe it."

China will continue illicit trade in virus infested wildlife and follow their usual modus operandi of whitewashing history  while Trump, the snake oil salesman, spouts one crazy lie after another."
2020-03-18 10:37:18,"Here's the question for America.  Is leadership, like hindsight, a 20:20 proposition?  I am still waiting for the Trumpers to recognize that 'the damage has been done'. They currently shrug their shoulders and think it's not so bad.  They keep telling themselves it's just like the flu.  What are our Republican leaders doing in all this ?: telling you to go out to dinner with your family, wearing gas masks on the House floor  to mock the crisis, and Rand Paul, sensing the great urgency of the situation..... a physician no less....is blackmailing the American people , holding up their aid to get something he wants that is totally unrelated and totally irrelevant.  The next thing you will hear from Trump is ""Well there are Republican viruses and there are Democratic viruses.  And coronavirus is a Democratic virus"".  And the base will utter a uniform ""Yeah.  That's what I am talking about"" as the symptoms set in."
2020-03-18 02:11:58,Medical experts and disaster handling experts who know what to do unlike Jared Kushner or Larry Kudlow are needed ASAP. Trump is a skilled salesman and conman who doesn’t care about hurting people.

Cancerous Trump denied the deadly coronavirus simply for his own political needs... 

Remember Cancerous Trump told the world in early January that he spoke to China's President Xi, while the epidemic was killing Chinese nationals.  Did Xi pass it off as nothing? No, of course not. Xi was smart enough to see the disaster unfolding.

CDC and other government officials knew the 'unknown' aspect of the virus was the danger, not knowing how it could spread and how to stop it. They told Trump but he arrogantly  ""knew' it was just like the ordinary flu and no big deal...

Cancerous Trump has never, even when he gave seasonal flu death figures, shared a sorrowful moment for the victims and since this pandemic has NEVER shared compassion or sympathy to ANYONE...

Be the cure for the Virus that is Trump, vote him out in November.

Better still, arrest him and throw away the key."
2020-03-18 03:33:22,"We are truly living through Orwellian times.
The only reason that this continues is through the collaboration and encouragement of the right wing media machine.
Trump should be called out for his incompetence, greed, corruption, criminality, and lack of leadership.
Instead, we have to listen to the frank sycophantic statements emerging from Mike Pence's mouth.
A whole segment of the population mistakes Trump standing in front of a podium as ""leadership"" ... that still amazes. Truly."
2020-03-18 09:29:26,@Nathan.  Oh baloney.  Trump can’t do more than one thing at a time?  Is that what you are saying?  He managed somehow to play golf a lot in December.

2020-03-18 03:37:23,"This, according to a prominent hydrologist, explains why Trump is lying again.
To quote that doctor, Dr. Lance Dodes, Harvard Phycologist;

“Mr. Trump is a sociopath, in that he meets every diagnostic criterion for the official diagnostic term “Antisocial Personality Disorder.” The fact that this is a personality disorder, rather than simply a single symptom such as anxiety or depression, means that all his actions are signs of this severe, continuous, mental disturbance.
To understand his actions, it is essential to keep in mind that sociopaths have only one goal: to enhance themselves, and that in pursuing their self-interest, they lack both normal human empathy for others and a normal human conscience. Cheating, conning, lying, stealing, threatening are all done with no remorse.
When stressed with facts that would require them to admit failure, or even that others know more or are more capable than them, sociopaths lose track of reality, becoming delusional with insistence on the truth of what they psychologically need to maintain their superior view of themselves. Indeed, nobody matters except to the degree they can serve the sociopath’s personal needs.
That’s why loyalty is demanded, but as soon as an associate disagrees, the sociopath turns on them with a fury; there was never a real relationship to begin with.”
Trump to a tee!"
2020-03-18 10:38:02,"trump has too much on tape and tweet to prove his own point false.  Up until last Friday, there was no inkling he fully grasped the risk.  He still says it will ""wash away"" which is to how viruses work.

He recognizes that history will not be kind on how he is handling it.  And he sees his poll numbers, which show he is losing independents in droves, which is not good for his chances.  He still gets up in front of camera, refuses to model recommended behavior, and shows little emotion and empathy when he speaks.  (Compare that to Biden's speech last night after winning the Florida and Illinois primaries - calming, reassuring and serious at the same time. something trump has yet to achieve).

At this point trump must realize he cannot rewrite history, nor cover up his and his administration's missteps.  He needs  to act for the future, getting broad testing started (still, it is an issue after declaring over two weeks ago anyone who wants a test can get a test.  WRONG.  Still wrong.). Sadly,  governors, mayors, business owners and others have stepped up in trump's leadership void.  They may be the ones that save us, not trump."
2020-03-18 05:02:49,"I used to think of Trump as a pathological liar. I still do, but I realize he can not tell truth from fiction. The man is incapable of doing that. For him lies are truth? Fiction is reality. As frustrating and angry as his presidency makes me, I have started to wonder what it must be like to live with this man, have him as a relative, or having done business with him. It isn’t as though he is a “stable genius” or an astute business man. He is insane and delusional. That is what scares me the most. We will hopefully have to deal with him or another nine months. Pity the people who will spend the rest of their lives with him."
2020-03-18 04:12:25,"If Trump were really as clever as he thinks, he could have gotten right into action: order test kits, ensured that masks and protective gear were in place, began to address the economic fall-out before it happened, had the Department of Education figuring out steps for schools, anticipated and quelled public panic, etc. He could have possibly clinched November by doing all all the right things. Instead this lying buffoon played golf."

2020-03-18 06:42:11,We should have removed him for his dangerous criminality but the cowering Republicans were spineless. His incompetence is now proving deadly.

2020-03-18 10:46:45,"The U.S. has experienced a delay in the full entry of this pandemic only by virtue of being on the opposite side of the globe from the source.

There was a 1-3 month window of opportunity to deploy whatever defense mechanisms we might have mustered, (although the citizenry would never have accepted the draconian measures which are now necessary), and “We” BLEW IT - - largely due to the egotistic, self-image serving, utterly leaderless blathering of our mistake of a President.

A failed human was in charge of the world’s highest office. Fun and games until somebody loses their life.

His lies, delays and incompetence brought us to this level of disgrace, mess and fatality. With the right and timely response this could have been less aggressive and easier to flat the curve. We have to make him accountable."
2020-03-18 08:38:16,"So Trump knew it was a pandemic all along. “This is a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”

The lying never stops. There are recordings of Trump saying  things that he now said never happened. Why doesn't he get nailed by the press for his abuses as president? 

Should we be surprised that Trump would want to make money off of a pharmaceutical company that would produce a coronavirus vaccine? The Trump administration offered 'large sums of money' to get exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine being developed by a German company, Die Welt reported. According to the article, Trump tried to get the Tübingen-based CureVac company to move its research wing to the United States and develop the vaccine ""for the U.S. only.""

 Trump ONLY cares about more for himself. There is no limit to his greed and no compassion for anyone or anything...JUST PURE GREED! He wants more power. 

How long before he cancels all elections ""for the betterment of this country""?

He lies and lies and lies.  Under the 'leadership' of Trump, valuable time has been wasted in controlling the coronavirus. The ignorance of decisions made by his 'wonderful gut'  has put this country in a very bad position. His ignorance of science and the hiring of loyal incompetent people is proving to be a disaster."
2020-03-18 10:48:27,the really  sad part is the Trump loyalists will believe every word he is saying.
2020-03-18 10:48:57,"It is obvious then that Trump took the opportunity to weaponize the virus against Democrats to say it was another hoax instead of implementing precautions to protect the nation. He should be sanctioned and he should apologize publicly for the chaos, damage and future deaths he has brought upon our nation. Do you hear Trump?  Stop serving money and tend to the people. That goes to the GOP as well.  We will remember this at the polls."
2020-03-18 10:49:52,Trump seems to exist in his own separate world where he rejects any information that he doesn’t like or suits him.  It’s a luxury most of us never had.  His inherited wealth and privilege have insulated him in many ways and he seems unable to relate to many of life’s realities.   It became clear very soon after Trump moved into the Whitehouse that he was not able to handle this enormous responsibility.   We can do better than this!
2020-03-18 10:48:57,"It is painful to admit that I have lost faith in the ability of the federal government to protect us because of one person: the president.  I have become anxious each time that he appears on tv because I know he is going to lie. This admission goes against my belief in treating people fairly and giving everyone a second chance but..... when people show you who they are, believe them.  What is even more frightening is that some people actually believe the nonsense coming out of his mouth. We need someone in the federal government to demonstrate real leadership and take over before this situation worsens. Please!"
2020-03-18 07:58:48,As if the scare of the coronavirus was not enough Trump is bombarding the Americans with his more deadly tweets full of ignorance and lethal as the pathogen adding to the toxicity of the widespread social contagion that has already vitiated the public mind.
2020-03-18 10:48:35,It's scarier to think that he might actually believe what he says.
2020-03-18 08:19:14,Just remember Trump only cares about himself and about being reelected. Now that we have a pandemic and the stock markets are tanking and we are on the brink of recession is this inept adminstration taking action. We will remember in November. The hole is too deep for Trump to dig out of. Trump always blames Obama for everything. What is Trump's excuse now?
2020-03-18 08:47:00,"That Americans still believe in him is unbelievable.  He lies and lies and still a lot of people admire his clownish behaviour.  Now even Joe Scarborough praises him, because on one occasion he spoke the truth.  He was forced to do it. Unbelievable."
2020-03-18 01:27:00,"Yeah, Trump is such a “stable genius” that he knew it was a pandemic all along.  He’s not a stable genius.  He’s a pathological liar.  I don’t believe anything he says.  And that’s a very troubling thing to say about a president of the US.  It’s Trump’s own words and beliefs. Americans need competence, but above all transparency and the truth.  Trump offers none of those things.  He needs to resign - now."
2020-03-18 10:49:58,"All one needs is a cursory look at President Trump's media and rally statements on COVID-19 to surmise that he did not take the virus seriously until it threatened his electability. Trump is about appearance and will lie his way out of responsibility in order to preserve his appearance. Without effort one can prove his lies to the public and show his true intentions. To the American public, do not let this liar lie his way out of responsibility for the predicament in which he has put this country. He has tried to blatantly revise the history of his statements about the virus, as if his past lies never existed. He is not serving the public nor protecting its safety, which is his primary charge. Vote him and his crowd out so that, hopefully, we can replace him with a public servant leading the country and serving the public."
2020-03-18 03:04:56,"“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters.

OK, Mr. Trump  Then you just admitted that, no you weren’t wrong, but rather that you intentionally deceived the American people and withheld life-saving information from your own citizens. And now hundreds of thousands—possibly millions—of your countrymen and women will die because of your duplicity. But sure, let’s not rush to judgment, let alone impeachment and removal. Let’s wait for November for the judgment of the American people—those who are left to vote."
2020-03-18 07:11:03,Ignore Trump's words. They have no congruence with truth but high association with whoppers. Concentrate instead on his and Pence's facial expressions. There's the truth.
2020-03-18 07:26:30,"The president of the United States is unhinged.

Once that grave thought sits with you a moment, realize that he can launch the entire nuclear arsenal on a whim.

It is a dark and stormy night."
2020-03-18 03:03:47,Too bad he can't pay off historians or appoint them to a government position.
2020-03-18 06:16:26,"The huge compensatory ego construct known as Donald Trump, declared himself a god today, again.

More importantly, the corona virus is planetary wake up call reminding humanity that it is one species, on one planet, in a lonely corner of The Universe. 

It is a a reminder that humanity needs desperately to work together to protect itself and it's planet and preserve the future together, under one banner. 

But what will happen is this; Competition against each other, as defined by national borders, will destroy humanity as surely as I write this words. Nice knowing you for a brief moment in time. 

Kind Regards,
The Grand Exalted Ruler of The Universe"
2020-03-18 02:51:36,"Unbelievable...He knew it was a pandemic before he knew the definition of the word pandemic! Such audacity.
And through it all he has not offered one word of condolence to the￼ families of the deceased...not one word of praise for the healthcare workers on the front lines, not one word about the fantastic job done by the state and local governments who took it upon themselves to organize the fight against the virus when the federal government couldn’t get out of its own way.
Just self praise and self adulation.
No effort to bring us together and unite against this threat.
“Have you no shame, Mr. President”
I guess not."
2020-03-18 02:12:17,"The Times needs to be more precise in its use of language.  Needs to write as Orwell would want.  Trump and those hanging around him, applauding him, are criminally negligent. They are, by their actions or their enabling silence, culpable."
2020-03-18 03:22:21,"Trump rewrites History.

2020-03-18 10:50:48,"Thanks Ms Rogers. Good article. You have pointed out that our ill equipped former game show host president and his self serving lies, supported by Hannity and Fox and Friends,   went a long way towards, in the early stages, downplaying  the severity of the virus.

In fantasy land I think of a class action lawsuit against Fox for spreading false information that led to their audience members becoming ill or dying. The network, led by Hannity and Fox and Friends, faithfully passed along Trump inspired propaganda as if it was true."
2020-03-18 10:51:44,"For him, saying whatever Fox News tells him to think is just like saying to a potential investor that ""all units have a water view"" or ""we have commitments on 90% of the units.""   Just another lie to another mark.  That's the way he has always been and we know that.  The true and utter disgrace is the members of the Republican Party who support and enable his deadly dangerous behavior.  There are times when I think Dr. Fauci would like to smack him with something but restrains himself because he can realize the actual severity of the situation."
2020-03-18 02:05:03,"But there are zero cases in West Virginia. Zero cases! Did I tell you there are zero cases in one state? West Virginia. They must be doing something right in West Virginia, right? That governor! Good job. Zero cases. That's not a lot, zero. Zero is a small number. And you now where there are zero cases? Yes, right, in West Virginia! Great state. Great Governor. So the virus isn't all across the land, you can't say it's in every state. Because West Virginia. Zero. Zero is a big number Hugely. No. It's a small number. Very small number. Zero. No number is smaller That's a number so small the likes of which we have never seen before. Zero. Did I tell you that state - which one was it - West Virginia. Zero cases. Amazing. 

( Alas, the JHU dashboard records one case today in WV. )

Don't put anything past this, this,...guy."
2020-03-18 07:53:47,"I wonder if sometimes NYT needs a section perhaps after the serious news to, ok, poke fun at pretentious affront.

The childhood  image of poking sticks into a caged bully is not my own.

As I got older and studied Medieval images of sticky ends of bad 'uns.


As a responsible adult I am laughing at Trump.

He is to be endured until the next election.

Love to see the images of Trump commenting on he along with  other patriotic leaders such as Thiery le fronde, William Tell, Robin Hood sandblasted into Mt Everest. 

Well that won't happen but his mate in North Korea may suggest that he could do a deal could arrange a statue along with stone statues of Lenin, Stalin and Mao.

If the truth be told job lot includes a granite rendition of Castro.

The Trump Library will include a shredder.

Time Magazine covers with Ivanka at the Resurrection and the Cross predated to 30 AD or roughly  are available by credit card.

Think about the joy of life.

Trump is the first man off the Titanic.

“This is a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”

Trump is a joke unfunny.

Next he will be barking Trump Hotel in Antarctica.

To be serious the hole in the US budget is eyewatering to the point of tears.

Future children will have to pay for this gross frolic.

Americans buy guns.

I admit loss of humour."
2020-03-18 05:46:55,"See, there you guys go again. Always listening to what he actually says instead of what he means to say.   So unfair."
2020-03-18 10:01:53,"Pathological liar. Someone needs to get in Trump's face in a similar manner to how Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) did to Good Will Hunting (Matt Damon) and repeat ""the spread of Covfefe-19 in the US is all your fault"" over and over until Trump admits it and starts to act presidential. Might take a few months of saying this (not the half dozen times in the movie). Hmmm, perhaps the extreme treatment Alex receives in A Clockwork Orange would be more appropriate. The Base should also be forced to watch this on live stream until they too are broken of the trance they are in."
2020-03-18 04:19:49,"You know, this might be a card out of the Republican playbook.  I remember very well when the sainted Ronald Regan refused to utter the words AIDS until the epidemic had reached unimaginable heights.  You have to ""respect"" Reagan though.  He never backtracked and said that he knew from the beginning what AIDS would turn out to be.  This President, on the other hand gives a new meaning to word ""waffling"".  It is simply appalling.."
2020-03-18 10:10:13,I believe this is further proof beyond a shadow of doubt that the rump base is held together by racism. There is no redeeming quality in this man. His supporters love him because his only goal is to make America white again. They will overlook any and everything that he says and does. They are united in that singular goal.
2020-03-18 03:37:14,"If that was even true, it would prove him even more to be the shallow, uncaring man we know"

President No Responsibility Trump is all knowing."
2020-03-18 09:31:19,"Actually, call it for what it is criminal negligence. No one blames this sad example of a man for the virus, but he was briefed  in 2017 that pandemics were real. Expecting a reality TV host to get the briefing material is in itself silly. That is why you don't elect reality TV hosts. Now each death is on his watch. If anyone else led to the deaths of  hundreds or thousands we'd call them a serial murderer and prosecute as such. I do hope, when he is out of office, that he pays some price for his reckless and criminal behavior."

Me too."
2020-03-18 10:31:07,"I had a heated e-mail exchange yesterday with a friend who voted for Trump. 
The ""conversation"" ended when he said he was sick and tired of Trump getting blamed.
Not sick and tired of his lying, just that he gets blamed.
Annoyed that the Democrats turned the virus into a ""political football""!

Unbelievable but there's one data point out of millions."
2020-03-18 07:36:24,"Trump himself gave us a perfect self-critique of his performance when he bizarrely retweeted a photoshopped picture of himself fiddling on a violin with a serene expression on his face, captioned, ""My next piece is called...Nothing can stop what's coming!"" He added, ""“Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!” 

He seemed to be consciously, or unconsciously, likening himself to Nero, not perturbed by or feeling responsible for dealing with the scourging of the city by fire, or in the present case, the country by pestilence."

And we cannot forget his base who hang on every word out of his mouth like it was spoken by God.  

And then when he does a 100% turnabout and says the exact opposite, their hero worship mentality somehow is able to rationally explain it.

It is not just trump here.  It is the Republicans and his base who believe whatever he says even when he contradicts himself.

Amazing, truly amazing.  Maybe it's Stockholm symptoms."
2020-03-18 10:57:56,"I could not believe it when I heard it. I had NPR on. I stopped the car. Even for a pathological liar, it was too much to witness so much callousness: using a world pandemic to campaigning. He must have practiced the stern look for hours in the mirror, maybe with a coach.

2020-03-18 05:09:59,"I get whiplash from all the lies this man says, without even batting an eye. I really don't think he has the mental capacity to distinguishes what is the truth and what is a lie. The truth is whatever pops in his head at the time. For our own well being, we need to stop believing this man. All that seems to come forward out of his brain is ""I need to reward my friends. I need to reward my friends"" but then he gets confused on how to do that. It is depressing to watch this incompetent man struggle with reality. He doesn't even seem to realize that there are tapes that show he is lying about him calling it a ""hoax"". He just expects that now that he has changed his story, we should all believe what he is saying now.  We need honesty in the time of crisis and Trump is just so incapable of telling the truth."

But we will not be fooled.   Political spin and revisionism are not going to work here.

I guess he can blame it on the alignment of the stars, or the media.  Or someone with a disability.  It's an Alice in Wonderland world."

I’m glad you point these things out; probably you should start calling him a liar when he lies.

2020-03-18 11:03:35,"Perhaps our country is now fighting a war on the pandemic.  If Trump is our commander in chief he just allowed the enemy army to invade every state in the union and to establish several bases of operation that will become permanent. Unless we spend a few trillion dollars to remove the invaders our experts project that millions of our citizens will perish.
In response to this military disaster what Trump would say is that he knew the enemy army was coming and that he was fully prepared to deal with them. But is he? Are we?"

It was hard to hear his Cassandra-like knowledge when his administration has carefully distracted us with a cavalcade of crises, criminality and chaos. Simply dismissing the Oracle of DelphLIE, is unhelpful.  To fight a pandemic, America needs to cling to the clear, unvarnished public information and policies of our soothsaying President."

He even tried to secretly buy a German pharma company which is developing a vaccine so only the US could have the use of it. Have you any idea how morally bankrupt and despicable that looks to the rest of the world? - and yet no one in the US is sanctioning him for it???

This newspaper has been played for fools by the far right who understand that the extreme fear of the editors and reporters mirrors the extreme fear of the people in the CDC.  All of you are more afraid of Trump than you fear the destruction of this country and democracy.

For shame.  When the story of this time is written by future historians, the editors and Washington bureau reporters will be seen as cowardly fools, no better than the CDC sycophants, and the historians will place a great deal of blame on that cowardly reporting."

It's a stretch to say he was not calling the pandemic (not the ""virus"" as you chose to put it) a hoax.

Trump’s ineptitude In his negation of the seriousness of the situation as well as his firing of the NSA Pandemic Team must stick to this sociopathic Teflon entity like Gorilla tape taped to itself."
2020-03-18 05:53:09,Thank You!! Please do more articles like this.This is how we combat propoganda. please continue to show his actual statements.
2020-03-18 03:33:43,Feb. 28: he called it a “hoax.”
2020-03-18 10:09:07,This headline is another example of normalizing POTUS lying to public.  The lede is not his claim it’s that he continually misleads the population of US.
2020-03-18 07:59:05,Can we trade our bailout checks for a new president?
2020-03-18 11:03:22,No surprise. Everything he says is a lie.
2020-03-18 06:13:06,Didn't you just know he would say this?
2020-03-17 23:42:39,Reread George Orwell's Animal Farm.... Trump can twist and lie about anything to sound real.
2020-03-18 05:55:38,"He could claim he invented the wheel. It doesn't matter anymore. 

Few words that leave his mouth have any value. He is a constant self serving liar. He has surrounded himself with equally incompetent sycophants who degrade themselves at the feet of their dear leader. He is politically useless. 

He has zero credibility. He is incompetent, self serving, and endangers the citizens he is meant to lead. 

Dr. Fauci is the first real breath of leadership coming from the admin side of things ever. Someone worth listening to - especially now. 

Right now, Fauci is President."
2020-03-17 23:40:25,He is unfit for office. Mitch McConnell - the gravedigger of American democracy - is responsible. The Constitution worked until it went to etc Senate.
2020-03-18 09:41:53,A very dangerous man
2020-03-17 22:50:47,"Hey, smell the leadership on that guy."
2020-03-17 23:41:17,What is the surprise?  He’s a chronic liar.
2020-03-18 01:24:27,"Please don't tell me that every politician lies, for indeed, so does every human being lie to some degree. But Trump is the most utterly shameless, relentless, serial liar ever to disgrace the American presidency. For him, there is no yesterday or tomorrow, but only the expedient performance that gets him through today. It's become even more repulsive to watch Pence kowtow to his boss's shameless behavior."
2020-03-18 07:49:28,So Trump’s leadership is a mess on this crisis. Agreed. Where is Pelosi now? Too busy watching the videos of herself ripping up Trump’s State of the Union message? Where is Ms. Mouth now? Absolutely ridiculous.
2020-03-18 02:17:20,He mocked the idea it would be a threat to Americans. He mocked anyone who suggested it would be. He is disgusting. He's fooling no one.
2020-03-18 10:44:42,He continues to lie as people die. He must lose in Nov.
2020-03-18 00:57:55,Did Trump know Coronavirus was a pandemic before or after he called it a Democratic Party “hoax” ? What did he know and when did he know it?
2020-03-18 01:18:38,"He knew he knows nothing. Gee he had a swell donor paid birthday party when he laughed and said it was no big deal and spent two days playing golf with the Washington Nationals. There is a team I will never pay to see. The birthday brought in hundreds of thousands for the Trump campaign and he and is cheap, stupid son never put in a dime. I love how Trump supporters never catch on the fact his money is his and so is yours. He is cheap skate and when he leaves office I can't wait to see all the rats run away from him. Catch on also this big bailout for the airlines, hotels. gee who will benefit from that, and thrown in with this $1,000 payment is your own future being flushed down the toilet. The payroll tax won't be collected for a year or two. Sounds great, till you catch on that money is what funds the social security and Medicare and this is part of the plan. So where will the money come to pay out to retired. Most of the money today goes to present and future retirees. Oh, then if he wins and if the American public vote for crook they really do get what they deserve. Social security will be gutted or it will become what Ryan, Trump, Mitch, Pence and Republicans have been pushing for your own account connected to the Stock market.I can hear it now another win win you know like Reagan and the trickle down of giving big tax cuts to the 1% and corporations. Yes, put your money in a market that has crashed 4 times in the past 30 years. Love the con."
2020-03-18 02:17:31,"If Trump always knew the Coronavirus was a pandemic week ago, then his response suggests he is either evil or corruptly incompetent. Either way, his lies have caused many deaths and going forward he should recuse himself from the  planning and response to the pandemic."
2020-03-18 03:54:17,"The sad thing is not the fact that he is lying, arrogant, ignorant, narcissistic, amoral, etc.   It is that he has the power to ruin this country, this world, for many years to come.   Many billions lives (plants, animals, people)  are and will be affected, not in a positive way.  Yet, there are millions of people are happy to help him to accomplish just that."
2020-03-18 05:15:59,"If he really knew this was a pandemic before it became one, doesn't that make Trump a criminal.  He was willing to spread lies in order to make himself look good?  He lied about the safety of every American?  
You can't get more morally depraved than that."
2020-03-18 06:45:20,"That Donald Trump is an unremorseful, compulsive liar has been known since long before he was elected. The most disturbing element we've learned since his election is the unrestrained complicity of his supporters. They facilitate and enable him each and every day, sharing his denial, his repression and his lies as glibly as collaborators and Quizlings in World War II. I used to vote for Republicans on occasion. Having learned that their candidates are completely untrustworthy I'll not be making that mistake ever again."
2020-03-18 11:21:06,"All this comment from Trump is proving other than his comedy potential, is how well he can contradict himself by past behavior. This grandiose lie is a whopper."
2020-03-18 02:43:13,"Of course! This man lives by lies. That’s what becomes his life as our president!  As Trump’s tenure in office extends, disgust increases. We’re in trouble and he has no clue about it. On his side,  generously speaking, he simply may not know, ie, night and day."
2020-03-18 03:50:11,"I think it's time to stop pretending with this guy. Instead of calling out his inconsistencies and bold face lies while trying to figure out what he means when he utters them, we should be talking at a much higher level, referring to the mental illnesses this President is likely suffering and how they effect the delusional words coming out of his mind and mouth.
I'm not sure he can be called a liar, as that implies that he knows them to be lies. It's much worse. He actually believes what he is saying."
2020-03-18 04:00:17,Don't forget that Trump called the Governor of Washington a snake for criticizing the White House response (or lack thereof) to the virus.
2020-03-18 05:46:51,"There is something even worse than Trump’s many lies, and that is the willingness of far too many people to accept his lies."
2020-03-18 09:21:41,"Thank god you again and again uncover the truth about Trumps brazen claims. Don' t be too harsh on him. He is really just a mirror of society. You must stick together now. Stop the fingerpointing. His lies and the stupidity of Stephen Miller are again very obvious. But somehow many people want to believe these lies. I mean when an address to the nation is written by someone with Stephen Millers mindset, you really are in big need to overcome the polarization.
Focus on working together to solve this crisis. You have this kind of reactionary president.
Work with him now. He finally woke up. And please fire him later at the ballot to prevent more damage."
2020-03-18 00:05:49,trump should be held personally liable for deaths from COV19. His own fortune should be seized to pay the families of victims. This is not a China virus. It is the trump virus.  A man unfit and too untruthful to be President becomes even more dangerous during a pandemic. He needs to resign.
2020-03-18 08:36:19,"Those who read and comment on this site have known this president was a liar and a fraud since before he was elected. We are outraged, but we are not surprised by anything he does or how low he stoops. 
What will really matter is when his followers finally realize that they have been played for fools and Fox News has been complicit in their betrayal. 
Only when these millions of followers realize that this president and Fox are purveyors of fake news will our democracy cease to be in existential danger.  
We will eventually survive the coronavirus, but we are truly threatened by those who unquestioningly embrace right wing propaganda."
2020-03-18 00:33:15,"Has anyone alerted FOX to the change?  

We should be seeing story retractions any minute now..."
2020-03-18 03:13:19,"This article is a model for how to report on Trump.  His lies are news.  Blocking action on the pandemic for 6 weeks, and then turning around the next day and claiming that he predicted the pandemic, is a lie of astonishing brazenness, calling into question not just his credibility but his mental soundness.  It should make us all fear his inability to manage this crisis, if not the likelihood that he'll botch it horribly.  A lie like this deserves a headline story."
2020-03-18 03:21:05,"Glad you've published this article, but I imagine for a significant portion of the public, Trump's claims will be seen as true. The true Trump cultists will believe anything that comes out of his mouth, and much of the mainstream media essentially goes along - just today, there were a couple of instances where CNN reporters went out of their way to praise Trump's supposed steadiness because he wasn't a raving lunatic at a press conference for once. The American press is mostly terminally credulous."
2020-03-18 04:09:38,"After Trump, Fox Opinion hosts, Republican Congressmen declared this pandemic a Democratic hoax, partisan fear mongering, and a contrivance to make Trump look out of touch and insensitive, all of the above are now claiming, ‘I told you this was a serious problem.’
They have no shame, take no responsibility, and their hypocrisy is noted by anyone paying attention."
2020-03-18 06:36:03,"How does a President get away with such behavior? I was never a fan of Cuomo, but to tell a governor “Hey, go find those vents yourself?”
And since when, is the President and Vice President always together during a crisis? I thought they where supposed to be separated? Or perhaps my training of 18 years in The Marines was wrong...
This guy needs to go..."
2020-03-18 07:37:34,"Dems: ""Let's go to the video..."" This monster will continue to lie right up to election night.   We don't need talking heads saying ""He's a liar.""  We don't need Joe Biden saying ""We need to get rid of this guy.""  We need the video. Again and again and again.  People must never forget for one single minute until they walk into the voting booth (assuming His Majesty and Sir Mitch deign to allow elections to go forward--a mighty big assumption)."
2020-03-18 11:01:57,"It is sad, when the President of the United States continues to spread falsehoods, then back tracks when proven wrong. The ineptitude of the President has been magnified by his incompetence of running of the office of the presidency."
2020-03-18 00:45:29,Of course he rewrites history...it's one of Trump's many skills.
2020-03-18 01:14:33,"I remember at the very beginning when we had to go through a couple of months of hand-wringing trying to come to terms with calling him a liar.

He is disgusting and that is why is fan base so committed. 

And that is why this is a pandemic."
2020-03-18 11:22:43,"Let's take a break from the nitpicking (unlikely) for a bit of perspective: as of now, 5881 cases (sourced from this website's data, the maps page). US population: 327 million.
Percentage of population that have the bug (well... this bug, anyway): .00179 percent.
If sheep could understand human speech one wonders what additional havoc might have been wrought in the meadow when the boy cried ""wolf""."
2020-03-17 23:46:08,"If the rest of the western hemisphere had reacted as well and as aggressively as Andrew Cuomo and New York has, the COVID 19 curve  would be very close to being flattened.  
It appears that President Trump will not be expressing this so I thought someone needed to. Thank you!"
2020-03-18 11:15:36,Is it possible to remove a U.S. President and prosecute them for crimes against humanity?
2020-03-18 11:18:03,"Trump is going to talk his way into the penitentiary.  

It was criminal to spot a pandemic and not do anything about it."
2020-03-18 11:18:31,If trump knew this catastrophe was coming then why does't the country have more tests available for anyone who wants them?!
2020-03-18 11:19:18,"Criminal negligence.

Truly a forty dollar haircut on a ten cent head."
2020-03-18 11:19:30,"Why didn't a reporter in the room follow up with: "" So, you're saying you knew it was as serious as a pandemic, yet you still made light of the virus? Minimized the whole thing?""

""Why did you do that sir.""

At some point a brave journalist at one of these press gatherings - perhaps one who knows they are close to retirement - should just look him in the eye and say: ""President Trump sir, why do you lie so much! Why!""

And let him squirm."
2020-03-18 11:21:26,"This is the MO for Trump. Churchill warned leaders not to offer false hope to the people that could easily be swept away.  Trump did just that and then had to grow silent while the true leaders (Governors) and experts (scientists) stepped up to take command.  Trump grew silent during that process, but instead of learning, he has tried to coopt their work as his own and reinstate himself with comically sad results.  Trump is a carnival barking con man who does not know what he does not know, and does not know half of what he thinks he knows.  His arrogance, ignorance and narcissism does not allow him to move past this MO.  Most folks do not realize the dismal results that Trump has actually had as President as they are not well versed in the issues he has addressed. The folks, however, do understand their own survival.  Make America Right Again!"
2020-03-18 11:21:39,"He proved during his impeachment trial that he was capable of shooting a man down on Fifth Avenue and getting cheered for it.

Next there will be an effort to top himself.

I predict that it will be him standing first in line to receive his $1000. virus check."
2020-03-18 11:22:36,"When you run a country listening to Fox and not the experts, this is what our nation gets. A 'stable genius'."
2020-03-17 23:53:12,Translation: I just learned what 'pandemic' means...
2020-03-18 11:13:22,"He has been doing this all his life,  lying about his businesses,  cheating his partners (and on his partners), boastful,petty,  insecure and vengeful.  He has even tried to rewrite history with a Sharpie.  And 80 percent of Republicans think he is doing a good job.  This seems to me to be more revealing about America  than about Donald Trump."
2020-03-18 11:19:42,"Dear Bernie - Please do the right thing for America and end your candidacy.  It is the right thing because staying in the race is driving millions of Americans to continue campaigning and going to the polls, transmitting Covid-19.  If you drop out now, lives will be saved.  We can take a pause while the virus slows down in the coming months, and campaign in the general election in the fall.  If Covid-19 is still around, we can wait to participate until voting day, and vote in Joe Biden over Donald Trump.  Just saying that makes me feel better."
2020-03-18 11:13:35,"Trump never admits when he lies. He now says that he always ""felt"" it was a pandemic, even while he was saying it was trivial and overhyped maliciously for political advantage. So he *stated* that he was lying, but he hasn't *admitted* that he was lying, and he never will. With the help of Fox ""News"" Trump hurled American politics into the post-truth era--where facts, documentation, and millions of witnesses' testimony don't matter--and we may never get ourselves out of it again."
2020-03-18 11:14:54,"The time for assigning blame is past. Let the news media have at it if and when we get through this ecological and financial disaster. We are here and now..in the middle of a crisis. Yes Trump is an irresponsible narcissist. We all knew that,  and those that did not acknowledge it in the past, are forced to face the it now. But it doesn’t matter right now. What matters is handling the crisis as best it can be handled. This is now a problem beyond Trump and his silly antics. It is perhaps the most significant challenge any of us have faced or will face in our lifetime. And we are just on the first third of the curve. It is scary and devastating and will disrupt and cost Lives. Perhaps the news media will convert to reality only, and stop the sensationalism. Perhaps Trump will get real and stop running for re-election . But we need to concentrate on working with the recommendations of experts and taking the appropriate steps as best as possible in an unknown and rapidly changing problem with difficult choices to make. Let’s get on with doing what we must. Stop acting as if blaming matters now. Stop responding to the hysteria and cleaning off food shelves. Pay attention to the recommendations of the CDC and public health officials . Neither paranoia nor complacency will get it done. Get real fast ."
2020-03-18 11:19:37,"Trump played down the danger of this epidemic early on by telling millions of us that our 15 cases would soon be down to 0.  How many people got infected because, reassured by these remarks, they took minimal precautions against exposure?  And how many of those will become critically ill or perhaps even die?  Just a few days ago Kelly Ann Conway and Larry Kudlow, who presumably relay the official White House opinion, said the virus had been contained.  How many people relaxed after hearing this assertion and got infected as a result, and how many of those will become critically ill or perhaps even die?  

Words from the White House matter, and Trump tailoring his remarks to his own political image instead of the health of the country, may well have had disastrous results.  How much damage he did will never be known, but his irresponsibility should earn him removal from office.  His pathetic attempts to rewrite history only strengthen the argument that he is woefully unfit for his job."
2020-03-18 11:22:42,"The most telling element of all the Press Announcements coming from the White House are the presentations by the medical experts.  All with a connection to the administration, have a preface to their remarks.  These are all similar like, “Thanks to the leadership of President Trump——-“.  When or will the man who is the current President wake up and realize how shallow this is.  He’s not fooling any thinking American."
2020-03-18 11:22:41,There is literally nobody in the GOP who hold him accountable for whatever he says. And that by itself is more dangerous than this pandemic.
2020-03-18 01:04:14,Here's the problem. The people that vote for him don't read the New York Times....
2020-03-18 00:34:52,If somehow he really did know ahead of everybody else it makes his dreadful performance look even more incredibly worse.
2020-03-18 02:26:13,"So he knew all along, how does this not make him criminally negligent, or legally insane?"
2020-03-18 03:30:34,"Our post-Prescient Stable Genius.
We just keep Winning.
He was right. 
Again!

He's a Sharpie!
On acid."
2020-03-18 05:53:42,We call that “lying” where I come from.
2020-03-18 07:36:05,It seems you left out the part where Trump called it a hoax.
2020-03-18 08:49:55,"As bad as we have it right now, it’s likely to get worse. But we’ll never have it as bad as the hundreds of forgotten children and babies warehoused in cages along the border. What monsters we have in power. They make me sick."
2020-03-18 09:36:12,"So Donald Trump knew a pandemic was headed straight for us and did nothing, claiming it was all a hoax??

Worse than impeachable.
Worse than Hoover.
Worse than Buchanan.

Vote him out in November."
2020-03-18 01:37:09,What is the surprise here?  Trump believes whatever he says at the time he says it.  He creates reality in his head and spews it.  It's that simple--and that dangerous to the country.  Shame on Republicans for looking the other way.
2020-03-18 04:01:11,"And this is the president whose Secretary of State chides China over its treatment of indepedent, democratic media? Our credibility as a nattion is shot. Our sanity and coherence as individuals is questionable. Our leverage abroad and our competence at home have been fatally diminished. That we, as a people, have elected and put up with this liar and his cronies for the past three years is inexcusable. Shame on Trump, and on all Repulicans in Congress—except Mitt Romney."
2020-03-18 05:50:30,What a glaring and vicious lie! How can anyone trust him to continue as president? Time for a tsunami of calls for him to resign immediately for the safety of our country.
2020-03-18 11:33:09,Of course Mr trump knew the epidemic would turn pandemic! He also already knows that the USA soon will beg other countries for help and that he will given his leave from an ungrateful people.
2020-03-18 06:07:43,I honestly don’t listen to what Trump says anymore. He is ignorant and he lies - a bad combination. I listen to Dr. Fauci and I follow the statistics regarding Italy’s experience to anticipate our own trajectory.  We are in for a rough ride.  Be kind to each other.
2020-03-18 11:23:41,It is almost (almost) funny listening to his cult deny his words and lack of action over the last few weeks. Sadly they till love him.
2020-03-18 11:29:20,"Gotta hand it to the guy, he truly has no shame about lying. It's pretty remarkable. Every day it looks a little more like a dictatorship."
2020-03-18 11:31:45,"Trump's congressional cronies should just tell him to ""lead, follow, or get out of the way""."
2020-03-18 11:32:47,"Special thanks go out to the Republican members of the Senate for allowing us to continue not having a functioning Executive Branch. Except for Mitt Romney, of course."
2020-03-18 11:26:58,"So he wants to send Americans money.
It looks like a payoff for votes for his reelection, and nothing more.
Makes me think of Stormy Daniels."
2020-03-18 11:27:04,"There are competent professionals in government service (mainly civil servants, with a very few political appointees) working on this situation, and we'll get through it. Would be helpful if Trump was to shut up and get out of the way, but don't count on it.

Let's not forget this on Election Day, no matter what he does right going forward."
2020-03-18 11:29:33,"History repeats itself.   Once again, the Republicans have driven the car into a ditch.   Hopefully in the fall, the “Democratic” party will be successful in record numbers and will not return the keys to the inept for a very long time."
2020-03-18 11:30:56,"What really bothers me is the abject cowardice displayed by Trump, the right wing media, and so many conservatives.
Man up, take responsibility."
2020-03-18 11:31:15,"At times it seems like Trump is unaware of the existence of recording devices.
Of course, Trump’s zombie-like base is by now so well-trained in Orwellian doublethink that they simply believe every single thing he 
says, no matter how mendacious or flagrantly contradictory. Of course, it does spare them the— for them—gruelling and challenging process that is simple logical analysis."
2020-03-18 11:28:58,"When he’s wrong, he claims that he’s right.  So, he’s never wrong, even when he’s very wrong.  When he’s uninterested, nothing can arouse his interest.  He’s deeply uninterested in the lives suffered by ordinary Americans.  After all, he’s president.  It’s all about him, and him always being right."
2020-03-18 11:26:15,"Office of Personnel Management chief Dale Cabaniss resigned yesterday six months after being Senate confirmed. She was respected and had bipartisan support. She felt she was being undermined by 29-year-old John McEntee, a Trump confidant, who was recently appointed chief of the White House personnel office. The federal workforce is 2.1 million people and zero guidance has been offered on: telework, sheltering in place or guidance for senior-citizen federal workers. The Trump administration is trying to dismantle key government functions just when we need them most."
2020-03-18 11:27:25,"We have a president who changes his words to fit what he wants the public to believe. Since he has demonstrated that he has little regard for education, science, or facts, more of the general public will do believe him, yet some do. This is a sad commentary on the state of our country today because people will die based on a virus who fits and behaves according to facts, not wants or beliefs. Now is not the time to doubt science and medicine (applied science) but now is the time to be safe and take action to protect oneself and others."
2020-03-17 23:05:03,Trump is narcissism in full bloom.
2020-03-18 11:42:02,"Forget impeachment, he belongs in jail."
2020-03-18 01:25:43,"Luckily there’s video to contradict the pathological lier who is everyday demonstrating how he never deserved to occupy the highest office in the nation.
November cannot come fast enough!"
2020-03-18 02:00:24,"He just can't stop, can he?"
2020-03-17 22:56:22,Shocking. Really out of character.
2020-03-17 22:56:44,Still plenty of time for another impeachment.
2020-03-17 23:12:18,"Ah, I see. So he knew all along and chose to do nothing anyways? Good to know."
2020-03-18 02:13:18,"Can we not have an accurate headline?  Or at least one closer to the truth. I know you won't report that he lied, but what about: ""Trump falsely claims he always knew the coronavirus would be be a pandemic"""
2020-03-18 11:14:11,Ronald Reagan has finally been proven right......government is the problem.
2020-03-18 00:38:35,"Is there anything he doesn’t know? “I am a genius, it’s all natural to me, I don’t know i just like it it’s easy for me, I should have been a doctor.” Really?"
2020-03-18 02:04:58,Not sure Trump even knew what a big word like pandemic even meant before someone told him.
2020-03-18 05:12:44,Short term memory is definitely failing him
2020-03-18 01:02:16,"I look forward to the day when, once again, shameless lying from public officials is not acceptable."
2020-03-18 01:04:25,"Of course he always knew.  The Obama team warned his transition group on January 13, 2017.

So what has his ""tremendous team"" been up to the previous eight weeks?  Millions of Americans are loose and never been tested."
2020-03-18 01:35:56,He needs to just stop talking.  And we need to vote him into irrelevance
2020-03-18 05:56:33,Trump really does talk out of the proverbial.
2020-03-18 11:35:28,"Trump was trying to calm people during the catastrophic worst-case scenario the press was pitching on a 24/7 . People don't need to be scared out of their wits and set into panic mode by any President. The President as you may recall stopped all traffic from China to the US the day after W.H.O. on Jan. 30th said that the virus was of concern for a reason. He was worried. He was also criticized for doing it by the left. Behind the scenes our country was preparing for the worst but the public face was designed not to set the country into a full scale panic like the stock market is in now as evidenced by their daily selling then buying then selling irrationally just adding to the panic of the people. Just look at the timeline put together by the NYT and you will see that the US was taking protective steps all along while not trying to panic people. Panicking people is the job of the news media and the Democrats when they do not control the White House. Everyone knows that. In any event the country is hunkering down and will get control of COVID-19 with the measures that have been implemented and are being  implemented each day. Our CDC and infrastructure was not and never was designed to test 300 million people or even one million people on short notice. The CDC and testing system are being reshaped by the Trump administration like any other administration would have had to do had this happened on their watch.<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html</a>"

See a pattern here... Trump lies to the public about COVID-19.  

And he wonders why he is getting negative polling and media coverage. 

We need truth and transparency from the president of the United States at a time of crisis.   THIS is a time of crisis... yet Humpty Trumpty just keeps on lying."

2020-03-17 23:18:37,I’m absolutely baffled by the president surrounded by his “experts” for the Covid19 task force - at every press conference standing shoulder to shoulder while telling everyone to “Social Distance”! Trump even tweeted that directive to us in all caps. Where’s the modeling? How does Dr. Anthony Fauci who knows better also stand shoulder to shoulder to the group and not insist that people move apart! It’s appalling and beyond irritating. Monkey see. Monkey do.

Trump hasn't governed as a covert stealthy subtle President of the United States.

Trump's daddy knew the character of his corrupt, cruel, dishonest, immature, incompetent,intemperate, insecure and lazy second son.

Trump's kids, mistresses and wives know his low reputation for telling the truth.

Trump's employees know his bad reputation for honesty and truth.

Trump's accountants, bankers and lawyer's know his awful reputation for honesty and truth.

Because Trump has always gotten away with being a corrupt evil bad boy at 73 years old there is no incentive for him to change.

But unlike Tiberius, Caligula and Nero, Trump didn't inherit his office as President of the United States by divine royal sanction selection.

Nor is Trump Julius nor Augustus Caesar ruling our constitutional republic by an armed uniformed military coup.

Trump won 63 million votes including 58% of the white European American voting majority in 2016.  And 2020 polls show Trump enjoys the majority support of that demographic."

Now that the pandemic is here, his default position of closing borders, cutting taxes and handing out bribes ($1000 cash payments) suddenly appeals to the suburban house wives he so desperately needs to get reelected.

For me, NY Times is one of the reasons Trump will win. Tweets from journalists that the electoral college is supposed to stop Trump from winning etc, and a stream of articles like this, that are just there to anger a mass that want to hear the same over and over: that Trump is talks nonsense at times, but often, unlike politicians, are reasoning as he talks and that is one of the strong reason he changes his mind and is perceived as more phony (he still is phony) than he is, and fair should be fair. Why not have fair coverage of good things that happens also and trust your readers to be intelligent enough to know the difference instead of this relentless propaganda?

2020-03-18 11:36:50,"Xi and Trump have so much in common.  They are both nationalists trying to 'make their country' great again.  Both are tyrants, braggarts, and will do anything to make themselves look smart, capable and competent (which, of course, they are not)."
2020-03-18 11:42:06,"It is Trump’s narcissism and resultant inability to EVER admit that he was wrong and to crow that he is smarter than everyone else that directly led to all the failures in his life ... multiple law suits, bankruptcies, impeachment.  It will likely be the proximate cause of the end of this disastrous presidency."
2020-03-18 11:52:31,"Of course Trump is saying this and the media will let him win on this (with enough people to count) if they continue to be so soft and avoid terms like ""lies."" Honestly, have none of you ever been picked on or dealt with a bully? Logic, reasoning, appeals for fairness... never ever work with a bully The only ting that works is to fight back hard and when you do, the bully reveals the deep seated insecurity that is a source of cowardice."
2020-03-18 12:12:38,"In the midst of a crisis, he still needs to lie. What kind of a person does that?"
2020-03-18 12:12:39,"It's going to be a struggle between those that are not amused by Trump's lying, preening, pouting, blaming, castigating antics any more and realize what a mistake he is, and those that stick to whomever is at the helm during a crisis."
2020-03-18 12:13:07,at this point why does it matter what he previously said?...I didn't think it was a big deal either and i'm sure a lot of Americans felt the same way. he is human just like you. why dwell on the past when there is a pandemic now!!
2020-03-18 12:13:58,He’s President of the USA.  Commander if Chief of the worlds largest nuclear arsenal and he still fees a need at every turn and twist to assert how smart and great he is.  We ought to have compassion.  It must be so horrible to live day and and out with the self-criticism and deep insecurities this man carries.
2020-03-18 11:39:18,"His serial lies are no longer newsworthy. Best to ignore him, since he craves attention and believes no publicity is bad publicity. Vote the Swamp King out in November, let one or more of the States sentence him to jail, and slowly start the lengthy and painful process of reviving the nation's spirits and economy.

What a mess!"
2020-03-18 11:47:13,"Oh boy, a 1000 dollar check..how is that supposed to help me. It's as out of touch as the state ""unemployment"" program payments that are based on housing costing 250 a month lol."

2020-03-18 12:14:08,"Then the next questions surely are “If you saw this pandemic coming for a long time why didn’t you a. Level with the public? b. Galvanise community leaders? c. Work with the media to inform the entire country instead of working against it? d. Why didn’t you move forward on a federal level on plans experts have been recommending for months?



This level of detachment from reality is psychosis and is precisely the type of danger Trump poses that the psychological community has been warning about. Who honestly can be confident he will not go back on his realisation again when things get really bad? That is the pattern he follows."
2020-03-18 11:39:28,"And this is a President? GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE! If he had been kicked out at the start of the year the Pandemic would have been handled totally different. Insanity at the highest levels. Republicans keep defending him. A walled in country loaded with sick citizens unable to get proper care. Wow, we see it is washing away? Maybe he'll divert the silmulus money into finishing the wall? The king of a kingdom without subjects."
2020-03-18 11:39:30,"Trump has a psychological condition that prevents him from distinguishing fact from fiction.   This is simply unequivocal fact. 
Trump’s compromised mental capacity renders him incapable to lead reliably and honestly in times of crisis. Therefore  America’s woefully inadequate response to the pandemic should not fall solely at the feet of President Trump but at the multitude  of responsible adults who let the patient run the asylum. 
Making Trump the scapegoat for the lack crucial leadership is simply reaching for the low hanging fruit.  
The Presidents White House advisors, cabinet, the GOP party and its supportive Congressional membership , his family and Fox News sycophants, let Trump lead the response to the Coronavirus.  Shame on all of them."
2020-03-18 11:58:33,"And all this happens when someone who is does not have the experience and intelligence to run a country gets put into office by malcontents with a mob psyche.

2020-03-18 12:04:03,"If ever there was a stark example of why we need to vote Trump out of office, this is it.  We're *way* beyond partisanship at this point, as Trump and his fawning sycophants are literally endangering our lives.  We must vote as if our lives depended on it, because that is absolutely the truth."
2020-03-18 11:44:38,"Thank you for the recitation of facts, but it isn't really news that Trump lies.  It's useful for historians to have a collection to show the many contradictory statements and acts that are the hallmark of this man.  However, most Americans are aware he is a pathological liar.  Those who ignore this plain fact are a mystery to the rest of us."
2020-03-18 12:03:54,"Just 10 days ago:

2020-03-18 11:42:30,"The president of the United States claimed the Cov19 was a “media hoax”, a “democratic hoax”, would be gone soon, and there would be “beautiful tests” soon available to everyone. People are dying but Trump has denied until yesterday. But it’s too late. His propaganda sits in the minds of his believers. Now the real result of his political obfuscation and outright denial, telling everyone to carry on as usual, be happy, is that millions of Americans now don’t take the pandemic seriously and refuse to avoid big crowds or self isolate. “Don’t worry, it’s a hoax, it’s not real”.  And the masses that believe in the Pied Piper are following him down the street to die or give it to their elderly relatives, who will then die. It’s THIS that is most definitely a cause for impeachment - deliberately distorting facts about a deadly epidemic, and causing people to die, in order to stay in office."
2020-03-18 11:52:12,"The terrible thing is that if by God’s grace we come out of this relatively well and the economy recovers in time for the election in November the electorate is likely to give Trump credit and keep him in the White House.  We as a people do not learn, and the Trump supporters, aided and abetted by Fox News, would give the man their first born even if Trump himself infected them because, after all, Trump is the chosen one.  Trump will be giving himself credit for eliminating the virus and Fox News will be clamoring for a Nobel prize for dear leader."
2020-03-18 12:06:20,"The CDC needs a special pandemics group to monitor worldwide developments and give us an early warning about any possible upcoming epidemics or pandemics. Oh, wait, Obama established one but Trump disbanded it. Never mind."
2020-03-18 12:15:13,"Another big word. I’m sure he never heard of the word ‘pandemic’ until recently, and then had to have someone explain to him what it meant."

They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in.

One is Corona Virus, the other is steadfast belief in a failed President. Either contagion has the potential for existential threat to our continued welfare. At this juncture it is difficult to effectively control the vectors spreading Corona Virus. However every citizen has the option to turn off Fox News and exit your propaganda spewing Facebook group. Social isolation isn’t required to stem the spread of Trump. Act now, the country you save may be your own."

We need centralized responses, overseen by urgency from the top. China and South Korea have done this right... the US has as its President a man who is incapable of being anything but ignored, even by all of his sycophantic appointees."

The safer approach may be to assume everything hs says is a lie from the get-go and have him prove that anything at all is the truth as seen by objective others.

With 16,000+ pieces of proof that his lies are a way of life, he is losing the moral authority to govern by any normal metrics and the word ""trust"" is missing in his lexicon."

Consider a president who declares a national emergency, then declares he is not responsible for anything....here's a fundamental lesson about being a leader, you can delegate authority, you CANNOT delegate responsibility.  This president's infantile fear of failure or criticism will doom the whole country.  Just do the math people....your health system is just not equipped for this.  The one thing you can bet is being regularly discussed is if this pandemic can be used to delay or cancel the November election...."

2020-03-18 11:35:47,"We need  a total reset of the political parties or new ones to emerge. Traditional Republican values were sold out in an instant. Where was fiscal responsibility as G W Bush cut taxes in the midst of two wars? Trumps tax cut will worsen the deficit Republicans always harped on. Anything to get elected. They would champion child abuse if it guaranteed an election. But what is sickening is watching Pense praise Trump for the first five minutes whenever he opens his mouth. Trump lies and brags and Pense confirms the lies and bravado. I remember a remarkable video of Saddam in a room full of political leaders and it seems Saddam had a bone to pick on some issue. The 'leaders' fell over themselves groveling, and calling out cheers and long life to the tyrant. I have seen similar videos of these guys dropping to their knees kissing the hand or cuff of Saddam. Many Republicans are getting close behind. Where are Republicans like Lincoln who decided to hold a presidential election even though he, and everyone else, thought he'd lose? We Americans have done our best to choose good leaders, but occasional we fail miserably. No issue, be it immigration, job migration or anything else, is worth tolerating a leader who does nothing but lie and brag and has bullied Republicans into validating his delusional idea of his success as President. The man lies knowing full well the proof of his lying is on video and audio for all to see. What does that say of his opinion of his supporters?"
2020-03-18 11:44:33,"You cannot trust Trump, nothing he says is true, and whatever is said is biased towards him, and only him

Does Mr Trump EVER say anything that's not false and/or self-serving and/or self-aggrandizing and/or other-blaming?

And yet there are many millions who view it as harmless - certainly no reason to doubt that he's doing a good job, and  needs another four years in the White House and on his golf courses."
2020-03-18 12:05:19,"To paraphrase what Mary McCarthy said of Lillian Hellman, ""Every word is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'"".

Where's Melania and why isn't she reminding him that he is wrong?"
2020-03-18 12:10:22,"Why is Trump parading around like he’s just won another election? He did the same during the last weeks of the 2016 campaign. But then, he had a secret asset named Vladimir Putin manipulating the social media. Between the upcoming election and the current plague, it’s hard to know for sure which is the disaster and which is the diversion."
2020-03-18 12:11:26,"In 2018 the U.S. had a ""Global Health Security Office"".  As its name suggests it was intended to be a agency intended to safeguard us from pandemics. It was staffed by reputable scientists.  In 2019, the U.S. no longer had this agency.  
I believe that trump was president at that time. And in keeping with his disdain for professionals and scientists (consider how he treats climate and environment) it was allowed to disband and disappear and only in the last few weeks do we have a group of experts facing our pandemic threat.   In an open news conference that was broadcast recently, trump was asked why the pandemic team was disbanded. Trump snorted that the question was ""a nasty question.  I didn't do it...I didn't know anything about it. ""
Right.  This is why trump holds on to his base.  By lying constantly and ignoring his many, many mistakes, never accepting blame or admitting errors, he presents himself as the 10 out of 10 leader who is perfect and surrounded by enemies of America who are out to get him. And his deluded base believe him, and Fox affirms his delusions.  A hard man to beat when so many vote in ignorance of how great a threat trump is to our health and to our democracy,"

I don't wish harm to anybody, but beside a virus who will not distinguish between anyone, we might be in for very high unemployment or worst. The trumpists might have to re-think their loyalties."
2020-03-18 12:06:20,"The opinion that Donald Trump is a political genius is over.
 Trump could have assured his re-election and his place in history, by leading a World War against a common enemy;  Instead he delayed the federal response, missed the window of opportunity presented by the original travel ban and aided the spread of the pandemic by denying the need for social distancing. 
 His many early denials of the severity of the ongoing pandemic; lack of effective preventive action; false projection of ""zero"" cases and comparison to the flu, have proven his incompetence and exacerbated the danger.  
  He could have been a War President without an actual war, 
(A modern candidate's dream). Instead he reverted to what he is, a proven con artist, spouting misinformation, dangerous nonsense and outright lies.
The usual GOP swath of America overlooked his lack of expertise and the constant falsehoods that service his brand, until now. That's over. 
 Now that it is about life and death, we all see that Trump went from ""I alone can fix it,"" to ""I take no responsibility""."
2020-03-18 12:13:20,"Trump's statement that he ""knew it was a pandemic all along,"" is chilling. If he knew it, why didn't he do something about it in January? Meanwhile, Americans are getting sick, plans are not in place to deal with it, and now all states have reported coronavirus infections. Why did he wait until March 16 to change his tune from mockery to carefully reading his script prepared by someone on staff, no doubt. Of course, his rewriting of what he has said over the first quarter of 2020 about the coronavirus, is just another lie. He thinks his followers are gullible enough to believe him as he desperately runs for re-election (his only concern)."
2020-03-18 11:33:52,"The President has a character deformation - he can't see that by lying much of the time over the last few years, playing fast a loose with the truth, playing politics with EVERYthing, he's sown the seeds of distrust throughout much of the population. And now, when we're all in urgent life-or-death need of clear, accurate information and cogent analysis, he's ineffective.  We don't believe him, and turn to others for the truth of things.

I am so frightened by the abrasiveness of President Trump."
2020-03-18 12:15:46,"I sorely wish my republican friends would learn the lesson that an ounce of prevention is cheaper than a pound of cure.  The president was so worried about his re-election chances that he probably felt he could somehow hide what was happening behind  ignorance and constant claims of fake news.  He has gotten away with so  much in his life he might very well feel nothing can touch him.  His lawyers can't help him on this one.  Nor can his present words.  He has always put himself above all others, nobody knows more than him he would say, but when you think you know everything you have stopped learning and in the position of the president we need someone that continues to learn, and has some humility and empathy.  We don't have that now."

Push him out of the way so we can get this job done!  You're the ""fake news"" and enemy of the people anyway.  We expect you to live up to those titles.
The arrogance and ignorance he has spawned has emboldened an attitude that is deadly in this situation, from the congressman who shows up on Capitol Hill in a gas mask to the basketball player who touched everyone's mic and then tested positive and the Scrantonians who crowded the bars even though the St. Patrick's day parade was canceled.  Trump's base will never get it (and can get their fill from FOX) and he pushed the rest of us over the cliff weeks ago.
Keep following him; recording him; filling in the chronology to be ready to bring it out again in October and November.  And be vigilant about what he else he's slipping by while we're all busy washing our hands, such as the Flynn pardon and Trump family business contracts. No coronavirus bailout for Mar-a-Lago!"

Roll the tapes. Play them nonstop on whatever media outlets they can be played on. Non-stop. I am so sick of egregious lies getting brushed under the rug. 

He had all of the best experts in the world to counsel him. And yet he used his very, very large a-brain to share his hunches with the country that the virus was no big deal.

Trump's COVID-19 lies, unlike some of the countless lies which preceded them over these last three years, are seriously consequential for the country.

I blame vicious, under-regulated, out-of-control American capitalism for making 40% of all American such vicious and hateful people.  Capitalism is based on a totally negative assessment of humanity, focusing on greed, fear, competition and rugged individualism all of which are both anti-Christian and anti-human.  Yankee capitalism is a powerful but very flawed wealth creator which also brings out the very worst attributes in humans.  It appeals to the reptile-brain part of humans, hence its power over the minds of Trump and his supporters.  The fact that Trump is in the White House at all is exhibit A.  It shows us the ultimate outcome of a corrupt, un-regulated, out-of-control, capitalist system.  Trump is the inevitable end point of a system that rewards the worst characteristics in human nature, including immorality, dishonesty, selfishness, narcissism, greed, tribalism, hate and fear.  Christian it most definitely is not!"

It’s like an Orwellian novel, where the Chinese gamed all of this out to ruin our economy, our way of life.  They knew we would throw away $8 trillion out of fear of saving a few thousand lives.  Heck, they extinguished that many in Uyghur for practically nothing.

If you see this guy for what he is, the ""aspirational facsist"" to borrow an academic phrase, you stop this nonsense of over and over again claiming with great shock, ""Gosh, he's not telling the truth!""

On a talk show a comedian did a routine where he said “lying is magical.”     You just say what you want and just say you didn’t.   It is astounding how much he lies.   He lies about everything.

3) When Trump earlier said that the pandemic was fake news, he knew that no one would believe him. His entirely predictable lie was thus understood by everyone as signifying its precise opposite, substantiating his recent claim that he knew a pandemic was coming before anyone else did.

I might have paraphrased her words, but the essence of what she said hold true then and still to this day. He boasted by giving himself a 10 out of 10 for his respond to the crisis and didn't take any responsibility for anything.

2020-03-18 03:34:22,"The biggest problem with Trump is trying to figure out what is really going on in his head. When the trait of being an inveterate liar is transposed onto a man of limited knowledge (and with no penchant for learning), it is often difficult to tell if Trump is simply lying once again or spouting some idiocy that he actually believes but is, never-the-less, devoid of any reality.

The biggest (and saddest) surprise is that so many Americans fully recognize the above, but somehow have talked themselves into believing that such a man could be an effective and respectable leader."

The GOP is responsible too because they had a chance to get rid of Trump by voting to remove him at the impeachment trial and they did not, so they own this as much as Trump. My biggest fear, aside from the virus, is that the presidential election will be postponed for safety reasons and we will be stuck with him beyond January 20, 2021."

His constant racist, misogynist harangues; his unprecedented, bald-faced lies; and his  embarrassing statements and faux pas internationally have done as much, if not more, harm to this nation than a  ""simple"" pandemic ever could.

The 25th Amendment should be invoked, but there's zero chance of that with McConnell's blind-sheep sycophancy. November will be our rescue, or it will bring the end of the United States' democracy as a political system.

Instead, hang out with smart people!
Smart people are...well, smart. They are fun. They have good vocabularies and good manners. Don't be around people who make you cringe. Don't be around people who have no class. Don't be around people who suddenly seem to have switched off their common sense—and obviously are in no hurry to turn it back on.
At this point in history, who can be a true friend with someone who supports Trump?
You'll find, as we all have, that you actually prefer to hang out with smart people...even if the only ""smart person"" in the room is you.

At least with this virus, you know it's not personal; with DT, you know it's personal when he seeks to help corporations first, when he's concerned with ""the market"" first, when he's apoplectic about how this situation will affect his reelection prospects, and when he continues to seek cuts to medicare and social security to pay for the huge tax breaks he's already given the wealthy and the powerful.

What is left to say that hasn't been said a million times?  He's a liar, he's incomprehensibly ignorant, he's a liar, he's entirely self concerned, he's a liar, he's more lacking in empathy than any other person on the planet, he's a liar, he has the emotional development of a toddler and the foresight of a rock, and...he's a liar.

2020-03-18 09:45:22,"I can’t waste another moment describing my malice for Trump. Not worth it. It’s when I look at the staunch white men who surround him when he speaks that truly repulse me. It’s like watching a scene from The Twilight Zone when aliens invade the earth. They all look alike and have the same pursed lips and deer in headlights eyes. To me, they’re even worse than Trump. They’re like a cult, killing their followers, putting a deadly needle in their arms as they smile and say it’s all good."
2020-03-18 11:54:49,"It's a simple question for someone to ask of this man:

You are president. If you knew a pandemic was coming, why didn't you do something about it at the time? Why the wait?"

2020-03-18 03:54:46,"It's sickening to hear the effusive ""dear leader"" praise from every administration member durring the presidential briefings.  V.P. Pence's are particularly grating.  How can anyone believe what these ""experts"" say when they preface every statement with ""as our president has said?"""
2020-03-18 04:56:15,"President Trump is a sick man.  Ideally, he would be removed from office using the 25th Amendment.

Since we have an election in eight months, the best thing that could happen now is to move him away from his responsibilities and bring in experts in medicine and economics to introduce possible solutions to the challenges facing us.  Trump, as most people should know by now, is a conman, not a leader; a liar,
not a problem solver; a narcissist, not a leader.  With a nationwide Recession aleady here, along with a Pandemic, we need the best people in the world to tackle the changes needed and find solutions.  Trump, McConnell and the Republican Party are leading this country into a World Depression."
2020-03-18 09:52:22,"And I always knew from day one that Trump would lie as president.

Trump lied during his campaign and lied all his life.

The coronavirus is a threat to all of us. In order to try to halt the spread we need a leader who will just tell us the facts and not say ridiculous unscientific 
falsehoods. 

We need a president to tell the truth and Donald J Trump is incapable of doing just that. Therefore he is a danger to all Americans in this time of crisis."
2020-03-17 22:55:18,"The man is so pathologically damaged it is almost sad. He would be a great character in some Shakespearean plot.

He is truly disturbed."
2020-03-18 00:39:37,"No new news here. Trump is pathological. It's been evident before he was even elected. This country is being led by a mentally unstable person. Unfortunately, humans have a weakness they cannot overcome. We are prone to being conned."

2020-03-18 05:49:31,"It doesn’t matter what these ny times readers think, I imagine for the most part they’re in agreement that the president is a liar. What matters are the electorates in those swing states. What matters to them, and I go on on a limb to assert, is that he looks like most of them, he hates like they hate, he finds the easy target, he exploits their irrational fear. All the president has to do, is to cast the Covd-19 as a foreign/Asian virus invasion. Once Trump has hooked his rabid followers, he’ll make them forget that the 1 trillion dollar tax cut was for the top earners, corporations. How repealing Obama care was in their best interest. He just needs to hate like they do, and all is forgiven, and any transgressions against them forgotten. Oh and never mind about the pending 1 trillion dollar bailout, most will go towards corporations, such as airlines (don’t we just love airlines?), and maybe some golf courses that have suffered irreparable damages due to the lock down.
Trump may not be an intelligent man, but he knows how to work the crowd. He knows how to conduct a symphony of hatred with his ever loyal, rabid, followers. 
And all is forgiven."
2020-03-17 23:23:01,"Would we all be better off if the Press just stopped showing up and covering Trump? Seriously? I think if you listen to a mentally ill person who can't stop lying, eventually it does some damage to you.

There is something very  unhealthy and exhausting about needing to constantly correct a mentally ill person. Ask those professionals who deal with patients in mental wards, those lawyers who defend serial liars who are also criminals.

Trump is creating a gas-lit and sick America. Why not just shut him out of the conversation and put our trust in more local governance? Like the state governors and local emergency response doctors? If Trump wants to be listened to, then let him earn that privilege. 

I know he sells newspapers and tv ads. Can we have at least some Trump-free zones? Please?"
2020-03-18 03:46:56,"We are so naive.  We keep assuming he will tell the truth when a lie could be so easily disproven.  This has never bothered him in the past, so it should be no surprise that he did it again.

The difference is he risked the lives of millions of Americans with his stupid response to the threat two months ago.  That is what we should be talking about, not that he is pretending he has done the right thing in any of this.  If it weren't for the intervention of others in the administration he would still be calling it a minor threat and taking no action at all."
2020-03-18 12:19:32,"If the President knew all along this is a pandemic, how come his actions didn’t match his “knowledge”?"
2020-03-18 12:24:17,"Thank God he knows more than the generals, the scientists, and the doctors.  

He can't use his trusted sharpie or call upon Stephen Miller regarding COVID-19.  Miller is probably the person who told him to call it the ""Chinese Virus""."
2020-03-18 12:27:20,"President Trump is a triple threat who doesn’t think, listen or act rationally. He’s conflicted between confronting reality and telling the truth, so he lies.  He lies about everything big or little, because the narrative MUST fit his altered reality.  A reality where he’s the hero. Always. 

He’s learned to succeed through bullying, suing and bankruptcy.  He is entitled because he demands to be treated that way.  The RNC accepted his failure to produce tax returns. Why?  

His base accepts his arrogant, unorthodox  behavior because it mirrors their distrust of government.  Rich or poor, his base feels threatened. Democrats are always telling people how to act.  They don’t want to be babied. So they elected a baby. 

The adults hired to control Trump all failed. He can’t be handled. The Senate found a useful idiot so McConnell can complete his conversion of the judiciary into a Conservative Club. 

It’s obvious he constructed an altered reality to his handling of this pandemic. Last week he called it a Democrat hoax. Yesterday he said he always knew it was a pandemic.  And Fox fell in line to this turn-around.  Hosts deriding the severity of the virus are now calling to end partisan bickering to get behind the president to end this (now) serious pandemic.  

Hopefully this pandemic will resolve quickly and in November enough Republicans, Independents and Democrats will end the viral incompetence of Trump’s presidency."
2020-03-18 12:27:45,"Can we just call trump a liar please! The words used like”misrepresent” don’t go far enough to describe the harm his lies cause. If we as a country had been more proactive and started dealing with this 2 months ago like the scientist and doctors warned us to do, we would be in a much better place, instead because of trumps stupidity and lies, we are sheltering in place, our elderly are at risk and our economy is tanking. Time for the Democrats to clean up this mess."

2020-03-18 12:38:59,"It's no surprise that Trump at first lied about the pandemic and called it a Democratic hoax.  He does the same with everything: he spouts lies and calls everything that threatens him a Democratic hoax. But in the coronavirus he has met a terrible physical force that threatens all humanity. The virus rips through Trump's flimsy, self-serving lies like a stone hurled through a cobweb."

It would be refreshing to have the news straight. Biden, our alternative leader, stated that he would not have closed the border with China. Imagine the scale of this if it was his decision. Now that's frightening."
2020-03-18 12:19:40,CIA and Military Intelligence knew this was coming. But Trump ignored everything and put his head into the ground.

He’s now admitted (in a shameless lie) that he “always knew this would be a pandemic” — a fascinating admission against interest. If so, he has no justification for his irresponsible lack of action the moment the first cases were reported out of China. His inability to ever be wrong, ever be corrected, ever not (pretend to) be the best, which leads to his ridiculous assertions and pronouncements, actually exposes his abject inadequacy both as a leader and, frankly, as a human being."

2020-03-18 12:41:33,"President Trump frequently lies.  That is not news.  Everyone knows he lies often.  His supporters know it.  His opponents know it.  The difference is that his supporters don't care.  

I am not a partisan of either party.  I think partisan behavior is usually bad for the nation.

You partisan Democrats are foolish to waste your efforts with one attack after another on Trump regarding this virus.  The November election is already decided.  Trump will lose.  He will not lose because any Democrat candidate was able to beat him.  He will lose because the virus has already beaten him (Trump has know he will lose for the past month or so.  You can see it in his changed, much softened demeanor and voice)

The public foolishly gives every president the credit for a good economy and the blame for a bad economy, regardless whether he really caused either.  In similar fashion, the public will hold Trump responsible for this virus, regardless what you partisan Democrats say or do.  And, in this case it is a double whammy against Trump since the virus will kill the economy and the public will hold the bad economy against Trump, too.

The relentless attacks on Trump by you partisan Democrats long ago became tiresome, boring, and totally predictable.  You are speaking only to yourselves as no one else listens any more to your relentless partisan drivel.

You should turn your attention instead to planning in case Trump decides no to run and you face a different Republican candidate."

The President, by admitting that the US is in a “debt crisis.” It is a 
 cancer eating away at our economic security and fabric of our country as our massive national debt sky rockets and Trust Funds race towards insolvency …

At best he intentionally mislead, at worst he lied, to all Americans and made both situation worse – not better. He had every opportunity to publicly warn us and seriously address both earlier, but he didn’t.

In both cases he was aided and abetted by a complicit Congress; both were more concerned with their political self-interest, not our national health!

A lot of people see that most people getting this and are coming out fine and miss the point that the need for intense medical care is the strain on the system that is coming.

When Trump said no travel from China, as an effort at containment, journalists screamed their favorite R word. Then they criticized him for doing too little too late.

He says he knew sooner than he admitted it was bad. So what? Does all the bashing help get people to listen to what they are supposed to do NOW?

The abandonment of our early-warning system through the office of the National Security Office by Trump and John Bolton did incredible damage to American preparedness. Shorting the budget appropriations for the Center for Disease Control made matters worse.

Instead of feeling any responsibility for his early recklessness and dishonesty, Donald Trump doubled down and lied to the American people about supposedly recognizing that this is a pandemic and, worse, by minimizing in his public statements and Tweets the danger facing us by the novel coronavirus. At one point, he branded the whole thing a hoax by Democrats.

Katie Porter has quickly established for herself a well deserved reputation that she will fearlessly ask the same question over and over until it's answered. There is no need to fret and fuss over Trump's rewriting history on this one. Just show the news clips...over and over and over. 

Morning Joe is not taking the bait and switch being implemented by the administration in general and the Surgeon General specifically. It is becoming more and more obvious that while there are perhaps many reasons widespread testing has not taken place, the overriding reason is the administration wants to keep the numbers in check. The Surgeon General dodged specifics with regards to questions about our country's access to ventilators and tests. In effect he said the horse is out of the barn. What we have is what we have. The emphasis needs to shift to social distancing and hand washing. The president is apparently  gambling the death count will be 'acceptable' and the true number of people with the virus will never be known. 

We need Katie Porter and her clones to pummel the administration with targeted questions until we get real time specific answers. Then we need to vote out this administration and make sure we remember what happens when we elect an incompetent, immoral, president who is incapable of empathy for others outside of his family circle. Electing a weak president has real life and death consequences."

2020-03-18 12:35:09,"If less than 1 percent of Americans have the virus, how can it be a pandemic?

If only 1% has been tested, thus far, how do we know what we are dealing with?

Where are the facts?

Governors will have to take the lead in their respective states because federal response is futile.

That is bad news for Californians who are saddled with Gov Newsum, who can't even get CA labs to create and ship tests, or staff labs for quick turn around time."
2020-03-18 12:38:59,"Of course he felt it was a pandemic even before it was called a pandemic.  It's just that he didn't know the word, yet.  Once someone told him, he knew that that's what it was.  Just a smallish one, to begin with, but very much like a real pandemic.  And in a very short period of time going to be the biggest pandemic in the world.  A great pandemic."

Every politician from the beginning of time has made mistakes. That’s what life is all about! As individuals, it’s our job to look at all the facts and then attempt to make a decision that serves the better good.
Today, we’re at one of those stupendous crossroads. How we, as citizens of this planet approach this crisis could affect our future and the future of multiple generations to come.
The Blame Game has never cured anything. 
Together, we can and will overcome anything."

2020-03-18 12:35:08,"I remember when ex-President Reagan was interviewed on TV and asked embarrassing questions about his administration:

He just smiled sweetly as he fondly twisted the facts to present his presidency as one of competence, decency, and great progress on all fronts. A golden age it was!

Then, as now, my eyes bugged out as my jaw hit the floor.

I think they both believe their own public relations stories. I imagine that we all do that to some extent, which is why we need others to correct us. Despite what Kierkegaard said, truth is not always subjectivity.

Objective science is our friend, in this case political science. Yet Trump lives and breathes in his self-glorifying imagination, which he, like all cult leaders, wants all of us to share.

The man is just not right for the job. He and St. Ronnie must be related to Neville Chamberlain, in spirit if not in fact."
2020-03-18 12:18:39,"I often wonder how different, and how much better off, our nation would be if more news outlets had pointed out Trump's lies - and called them what they plainly were - much more often all along."
2020-03-18 03:35:23,He did know.  He was just too selfish to do anything to protect the people he is sworn to protect because it might hurt him politically.  Shame!

People are and will be sick and dying because of his failure to act in the best interests of our country and all of us.

The only things and people he cares about are himself, his family and his cronies."
2020-03-18 12:21:56,"Trump's lies have hurt all of us, and probably killed some of us. If he was ever entertaining, he isn't now. The same is true of all his advisers and Fox. What they say and what they do (mostly, fail to do) directly threatens your family. 

Ignore Trump, Fox, and the rest. Listen to Fauci.

Then to make matters worse, if possible, he takes advise from the likes of Jarad k.  The country is anxious and we need a leader who can sooth our frazzled nerves. But, he is devoid of  compassion or empathy.  In other words, he was born without a heart."

Trump, the GOP and their Fox enablers will now be persistently putting the message out that they predicted this and have done a marvelous job fighting it from the beginning.  The zombies among us who have had their brains eaten by Fox, Breitbart, Limbaugh and others will swallow it whole.  I implore the outstanding New York Times and other legitimate media sources to keep repeating the truth on these matters.  Do not assume that your real facts have now adequately rebutted falsehood.  Propaganda must be beaten back at every moment it is encountered, even if you begin to get repetitious."

I wrote the below this morning.  Like another 80 million Americans, I could see this coming a mile away.  The man is a liar.  He alone can insist that pretending otherwise will get you 'kicked' out of his parasitic, charismatic club that is so exclusive, it has only one member:  Donald Trump - a liar.

Covid 19 is unfolding in perfect pitch.  Since science was involved, the threat was put on the back burner.  Since foreigners were the ones afflicted, it simply couldn't have as bad an affect here in the United States as 'there'.  The lackey's, taken over by this presidency, insisted that things were being overblown, that going out to eat was a great way to keep the economy strong.  

This morning, we have dollars being committed instead of ventilators.  

And Trump will insist he was right - he will look us in the eye, and lie."
2020-03-17 22:53:22,"As ludicrous as this statement is, the sad part is that Trump supporters will not only believe him, they will defend this ridiculous assertion to their deaths. At this point, it doesn't matter what Trump says or does.  Anyone who still supports him at this point will support him in November.  Yes the newspapers should continue to point out his lies and incompetence, but at this point it's almost a moot point."

People are going to die. Quite possibly someone each of us knows. And we have a POTUS who’s rantings sound like Jim Jones and his followers have all drank the Kool-aid. 

He had to have known in December when it actually hit Wuhan. And all this time as usual, lying and deflecting while using effusive adjectives like “perfect tests, beautiful tests.” 

He’s a liar and now quite possibly a murderer. Just another day in his Jonestown."
2020-03-18 09:29:05,"“Rewrites history?” You mean lies? Seriously, NYT, if you can’t call a spade a spade in the midst of this crisis, I’m not sure I can remain optimistic about the fate of our country. Trump did nothing to prepare for the pandemic we knew was coming. For months he called it a hoax and refused to focus on tests because bad numbers might hurt his re-election chances. Untold thousands will die because of his actions. And you’re still writing headlines that obscure the horrible truth."

The time has come to make the POTUS disappear, by Invoking the 25th Amendment. Publishing video recordings of his lies about the Coronavirus, in lieu of just printing his lies are more persuasive proof that Trump is unable to function in the job of POTUS."

2020-03-18 12:46:01,"We're well beyond the point of needing to warn the public of the danger of the coronavirus.  What we need is leadership and action to contain it!  Since there is too much unknown about how the virus spreads and too little ability to treat it, the most effective solution is hardcore quarantine to stop the spread.

There are far too many people wandering the streets without understanding or regard for the risk of contamination that they are creating.  Unless you are a necessary city worker or delivery person, stay at home!  Let's take the economic hit now and fast rather than prolong the pain and $uffering.

De Blasio suggested he may mandate home shelter.  That's good but needs to happen ASAP and with support if not actual direction from Cuomo and Trump!"

In a similar experience with a person who was terrified of admitting a mistake, the person claimed that his signature on a list of to-do items was done with creative photo-copying. He HAD to believe this, or else his goose was cooked. Same with Trump. NOW, what do his supporters think? They still think it is a hoax (see recent polls). Will whiplash unmoor any of them? I bet a few, very few."
2020-03-18 12:48:47,"If he always knew, why didn’t he taken proper action months ago? Why are there severe shortages of tests, masks, respirators, etc.? His narcissism knows no bounds. I do not believe he understands what he’s talking about; nor can he fathom what his inaction and denialism have wrought and will continue to unleash. He’s broken our communities, our health, economy, and the pillars of our democracy. Let the nation’s top health officials work jointly with governors, immediately, to provide desperately needed leadership and knowledge to manage and defeat COVID-19, as the health crisis it is. Restoration of any sense of normalcy depends upon it."
2020-03-18 12:43:46,Trump is unable to grasp that this crisis is not about him - it's about the American people.

2020-03-18 12:57:53,"Funny thing about facts - they don't change. So, while Trump offers his revision to history, whether it be Coronavirus or another issue, history has already been written how he responded initially to COVID-19. He can say whatever he wants at Press Conferences and at his Rallys - which I assume he is no longer holding, yet his voter base, would probably still attend. History has been written - his administration's response to downplay the potential epidemic, bolster the financial markets with the downplay and dismissal of what is happening in other countries will not affect the US is clear."

His final frontier is the utter destruction of the economy that began with the tax cuts, failure to fill important government positions,  slashing budgets and military spending. 

We have been living in a constant state of high anxiety because of his power grabbing, obliterating norms, ignorant and dangerous tweets and absolute unaccountability for his outrageous lying.  The huge retirement of Republicans who refused fealty has endangered everyone by leaving only sycophants who sway with the blowing of his vacuous hot  air.

It’s getting to the point where the world will need a miracle to   survive through the last year of his presidency."

1. Trump always knew the coronavirus would be a pandemic.  In this reality, Trump knowingly did nothing to prepare the government response, the medical response, the economic response, or the humanitarian response.  In this reality, Trump is  criminally incompetent.

2. Trump never knew the coronavirus would be a pandemic.  In this reality, Trump's ignorance and lack of leadership did nothing to prepare the government response, the medical response, the economic response, or the humanitarian response.  In this reality, Trump is idiotically incompetent.  

Regardless of reality, Americans suffer and die from his incompetence.  I'm curious which reality his base exists in."

If a French perfume company can jigger its facility to provide alcohol wipes, why can't some of the America First Corporations, with all their idle stock, not make respirators and masks?   They get NO money until they pull their oar here.   This is really a scandal."

Not so long ago, the FCC required a certain amount of airtime be devoted to public service announcements as a requirement for broadcast license renewal.

I am sure he was told by his top advisers from the onset that this is a pandemic. This is just a way to criticize the president for doing nothing wrong.

I thought The president was pretty good for the first half.   Then he couldn’t help himself and said things like the New York Times has terrible, untrustworthy reporting (translation they are an enemy of the state), and he knew covid19 was a pandemic before anyone else did.   Unbelievable.   So my kids got it.   Later in the day we read some content on our nyt digital subscription and the tv headlines.  The media didn’t take the bait much yesterday.   Good for all of you.

The reality is that his calling it a hoax and minimizing it for nearly four months caused fatal delays in getting enough test kits, personal protection equiment for medical personnel and expanded hospital capacity, killing many Americans who would not have died otherwise. Trump's handling of the pandemic resembled that of North Korea rather than South Korea."

Just when one believes Donald Trump could not behave more despicably and selfishly, he always tops himself.  Many of Trump's critics are hoping that his first real crisis in the Oval Office, the COVID-19 pandemic, will be his Waterloo moment. Since he will do or say absolutely anything to get re-elected, many of us have also learned to temper our expectations for the most corrupt and ethically and morally bankrupt individual to ever sit in the White House."

Testing that could happen right now in MA is stymied because of tangles of bureaucracy. Fact. We are flying blind into the maelstrom.

What the Remain-proponents did not do, was to focus on why it would be better to Remain.

This is a wake up call for America and hopefully it will be heeded.  

We have had a failure of institutions to create enduring policies/plans to deal with pandemics as well as other potential crises before Trump.  

We have institutions like the CDC, NIH and FDA that are so wrapped up in bureaucracies and antiquated regulations that they are crippled when it comes to dealing with a crisis leaving doctors without the tools or information needed. 

We have no centralized healthcare system and are left with a patchwork of safety precautions, rules and regulations that are neither standardized nor mandatory.  

We have no centralized patient database leaving us with an inability to adequately track outcomes needed to create better diagnostic and treatment algorithms. Instead we have lots of privacy regulations and electronic systems that don't share data.  

We lack a universal healthcare system leaving even those with insurance with fears of health-related bankruptcy, so they avoid seeking care.  

We have outsourced our supply chains leaving us without basic tools like masks and swabs.  

We bail out corporations while workers suffer.

Congress must create:
-Enduring crisis policy with safety nets built in, frameworks to ease regulations when needed
-Universal Healthcare
-Centralized patient database system 
- Flexible manufacturing

He, like the entire 99% liberal mass media, handled the grave dangers of COVID-19 with less gravitas than they probably should have. However, it is not difficult to imagine why world leaders and the public-at-large downplayed the crisis.  No one really knew save the world health experts.  Other alarmist calls have been made in the recent past which might have had the effect of muddling recent alarms.  SARS, MERS, Bird Flu and Swine Flu were also supposed to have been worldwide pandemics. Instead, these far more deadly viruses eluded the world and amounted to regional outbreaks that were quickly contained.   Most people can remember the impending doom that was said to have awaited us.  It is rather amusing now to hear petulant liberal media puppets--most of whom were more concerned with the primaries than the more serious dangers of a pandemic--criticizing Trump for the very thing they and most of the public was guilty of.  Trump is flawed, he is imperfect and he doesn't always call the shots like some virtuosic Nostradamus.  Trump doesn't always get it right.  In this regard, he joins a club of 44 president before him, including the liberal mass media's hallowed and deitized messiah Barack Obama.  The main difference is that there is a hateful disdain and childish tone to the invective that is hurled at Trump 24/7.  Your hatred is palpable."

Given the administration's contempt for science generally, I'm surprised that they haven't declared that the Earth is indeed flat. If there is one thing that is inexcusable, it's not to learn from history. There have been innumerable plagues and pandemics throughout history which have harvested many millions of human lives and caused much untold misery. Absent any radical advances in medicine, we can expect that such pandemics will regularly reoccur. What is notable about this administration is its failure, at least to date, to maintain standing groups of scientists and physicians to advise government on a continuing basis on the health risks facing our nation. Instead, it's been quite the opposite with qualified experts being replaced by political cronies who believe prayer is a substitute for science. Could a Biden administration do any better? Maybe, maybe not, but I doubt that their performance in this regard would be any worse."

Like many of us home with our children, I was watching a Harry Potter movie with my son - the 5th one - Order of the Phoenix. In the film, the Minister of Magic spends all his time denying the truth that is so very evident; Voldemort is back and about to wreak havoc. He publicly mocks, vilifies and pursues Harry and Dumbledore as they try to warn everyone of the impending danger while the heroes risk all to fight against the invisible menace coming for everyone. 

Near the end - only when Dumbledore, Harry and his selfless friends with the courage to fight for the truth battle Voldemort out in the open where all the world can see - does the Minister of Magic HAVE to concede, ""He's back. Voldemort is back!""

Newspaper headlines show us that as the film ends, Cornelius Fudge quickly fades away as the Minister of Magic, soon to be replaced by one more capable. I can only hope this script we are currently acting out has a similar ending."

This really traces back to 50 plus years of alternate reality where the GOP used fear to drive a wedge into the New Deal coalition. When justice started coming to minorities, whites by the millions took their well being for granted and became Nixon and Reagan Republicans. Finally finding a winning issue, the party of elites invested heavily in fear, and its sibling anger. All this was about ultimately was economic elites no longer wanting to invest in their country, their workers or any others. They just wanted more of ""their money"". For base greed, they destroyed our unity, stole our economy and democracy. The Democrats joined in to compete, as they saw it. We had elegant theories developed to justify greed. So the lies have given us an incompetent plutocrat who defends his class while millions addicted to lies believe he is their champion.

Trump is an inevitable symptom. The fault lies in those devoid of wherewithal to detect lying. They swallowed everything whole for so long, they lost reality. Their anger and fear they let be manipulated into what was most important. We have had social distancing for decades now in spirit, finance and politics. Having colluded with those intent on destroying the safety net's ability to function, we are now united in disease and death.

True believers will not be saved by their guns, nor sick religion. The only hope is to believe in and create effective government to survive their folly. And those that promoted it."

Why do y’all always wait for the safety of an article or a tweet to correct the record (and it’s not always a given that you will even do that) When did speaking truth to power stop being part of your job?
2020-03-18 13:59:48,"There's quite a paucity of comments here from the MAGA folks, whose pre-pandemic NYT Comments never failed to defend Trump against liberals who apparently are unfairly attacking him in an election year.  Even Fox News had it in themselves to fire Trish Regan.  I suspect that in private and to save face, the base is listening for real to our real leaders in this crisis, the ones like Dr. Fauci who correct Trump swiftly and before the whole world when Trump makes false statements."
2020-03-18 14:04:21,Only a naive child would believe anything this guy says. The Democratic candidate will have more fodder for political ads in November than there is time to air them. If the republicans were not so greedy and self centered they would dump trump over the weekend and find a candidate that could at least tell the truth.
2020-03-18 13:08:35,"Now one can add reckless endangerment to Trump's long list of criminal behavior.  The lying is par for the course, and many, many Americans are still behind this poltroon.  I remain flabbergasted."

Stay tuned to upcoming developments coming from the cemetery plot near the unfortunate fallen (sarcasm implied and meant)."
2020-03-18 13:46:05,"Maybe Trump should get the Nobel Prize in Medicine in addition to the Peace Prize. He could follow-up upon return from Sweden by giving himself, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs and Bill O'Reilly the Medal of Freedom, and maybe Medals of Honor too for all the hills they heroically they took in Vietnam or Afghanistan in their minds on the 18th green. Maybe Richard Nixon, Spiro Agnew, Charles Manson and Ted Bundy could get a little something posthumously too. Don Jr. should get something as well for courageously fighting-off and killing baby elephants and other of God's beautiful but heavily-armed wild and dangerous creatures."
2020-03-18 13:48:38,A video of Trump saying these things would be even more effective.
2020-03-18 13:58:26,"Suppose you take at face value Trump's statement that he knew all along that this would become this pandemic , then this is an outright admission of dereliction of duty  for which he should again be impeached and removed.  Or you could be a Type A Trump supporter who actually believes it is true!  

If more realistically, you see it as just another Trump lie, somewhere in the mid 16 thousand range by now, but can only shrug, you are probably in the majority.   Trump supporters may also realize it is a lie, but cheer it on because it annoys people they hate.  We could call them Type B Trump supporters.

My question is:  what happens when Type A and Type B  come together and discuss the question of veracity?     Would it be like... matter and anti-matter colliding?  Or more like dark matter accepting that both truth and falsehood co-exist as real mass of equal weight...both alive and dead at the same time, like Schrödinger's cat?"
2020-03-18 14:03:00,"There is a time when a president either leads our country by making good decisions or fails by making poor one. Trump has failed miserably. He seems more interested in what is happening to the stock market then to American lives. No, I don't feel safe. Come November I hope Trump is voted out of office. I know I and my partner won't vote for him."
2020-03-18 13:52:25,"China flights were not stopped

Trump and his task force repeatedly claim that they shut down flights from China in January.  From first hand experience, I know that flights from China were not shut down in January or February.  

First, the US cannot refuse entry to American citizens or holders of green cards.  So they need to clarify what they mean by ""shutting down flights.""   I flew from Shanghai, through Japan to the US in January and again in February.  Both times, my temperature was checked in Japan by airport personnel wearing masks and surgeon gloves.  Neither time was I checked at my port of entry in the US -- San Francisco International Airport.  The flights were full,  about half of the passengers seemed to be Chinese.  I am a Caucasian holder of a US passport.   Many of my fellow Chinese passengers also had US passports, some had Chinese passports and, I assume, green cards.  I was never asked if I had been in Wuhan, whereas on both entries into Japan I was asked if I had been in Wuhan.  My answer was negative.  I had only gone to Shanghai on both trips.

In short, full flights were arriving in the US from China, totally unchecked, in January and February.

This is one of many facts which the President got wrong.  Somebody should point this out to the administration.

His one point in claiming a ""10"" on his performance was the early shutting down of entry from China.  This, like other statements, was clearly not true."
2020-03-18 13:53:25,"World wide, the deaths from Corona virus will probably surpass 3X the losses on 9/11. We are now referring to it as a war. Yet, almost nothing has been effectively done by our government which is led by the Commander in Chief, Donald Trump. Even worse, he has fired many of the experts that would have led the fight and not replaced them with competent staff, and lied to the American people about the status of the battle. In almost any other county, such incompetence would have immediately led to a vote of no confidence. The leader would be replaced. The government would rise up and reject a real estate mogul who is clearly the wrong person to lead the battle.

As part of the current team that has repeatedly demonstrated ineptitude, it would make little sense for Mike Pense to assume the job. It should go to Nancy Pelosi, the next in line for the job until the next election. That would require a tectonic change in our entrenched political opinions. However, it would put in charge a leader with a proven record of abilities that even many Republicans admire. She is competent and would focus like a laser on what needs to be done. She also is a leader who would rely on facts and experts to lead the battle. 

Keep in mind, losing this war could cost our society trillions of dollars and devastating social disruption!"
2020-03-18 14:10:56,"To the NY Times, thank you for collating the string of lies. What we all knew is now neatly organized for anyone who cares to read it. It's even on Yahoo.
The question is, where is the press? Why aren't they calling Trump out on this at every public appearance?"
2020-03-17 22:43:36,"You cannot prove that Trump didn't know this would be a pandemic all along even if his words said otherwise.

He probably knew the truth from experts but decided to keep it to himself and not create a panic and distress the American people until there was certainty about it.

With Trump you must listen between his words.

It provably appears that you are upset that Trump is acting presidential in handling this crisis."
2020-03-18 14:18:31,"Trump’s recent claims that he knew all along that coronavirus was a pandemic, in the face of his repeated public statements minimizing any threat to the US from the virus, lead me to ask two questions:

1. Where are the headlines declaring:  “TRUMP ADMITS LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE”
2. How is it possible for anyone to know something is a pandemic before it has met the criteria for being a pandemic, given that the situation can (but sadly not in this case) stablize and never reach pandemic status (in the way that, despite the horror it visited on Africa, the spread of Ebola was contained)

It appears that while most of use “the retrospectascope” to look back at the past in order to put the past in context, and to allow us to reflect on decisions we have made in the past in light of current information that was unavailable at the time, Trump seems to believe that he can actually be transported into the past, change history, and unsay things that he has said.

How can his supporters not see him for the liar that he is?  I am saddened by the loss of rational and objective thought that seems to be occurring throughout our country."
2020-03-18 14:42:48,"Not content to simply lie about knowing it was a pandemic, trump has to inflate the lie and claim he knew it before anyone else. Typical."
2020-03-18 14:45:25,"In addition to Trump lying he had back up from the likes of Hannity Ingram, Pirro and Fox News writ large.  Rush Limbaugh ridiculed those with early concerns about the virus likening it to the seasonal flu. The Republican attack apparatus went into full operation telling Trump supporters that this was nothing to worry about and blaming the Democrats for overreaching.  Trump and his Republican Party have failed the nation.  Nothing they say can be believed.  But somehow we will all need to find a way to hunker down, stay home and avoid large scale contact with others.  Donald Trump and his Republican support apparatus have become a plague on this nation."

Fox and the other ultra Right-Wing media outlets are (and have been) doing the job of presenting Trump as credible. We need The New York Times to show explicitly that he's not."
2020-03-18 15:06:54,He was holding off announcing it because Jared and his brother were concocting a scheme so they could make money off it. Normal Trump leadership.
2020-03-18 14:28:49,"Is anyone looking at the actual numbers? We are at just over 100 deaths in the US. Most were 60 years old and already sick, and about half over 90. 30 were from one nursing home in Seattle. China has 3000 deaths in a country of 1.5 billion, and their new cases are sharply down.  I know, I know, we're ""2 weeks behind Italy"".  I first heard that warning late last week. We'll see. I don't know how Italy botched it but it doesn't seem to be the case here. Our city has millions of people on subways and buses breathing all over each other. 16 deaths (all 5 boroughs) in a city of 8 million.

Look for yourself at the headlines. It's mostly about the quarantines, restrictions, and the cratering economy. Not so much about people keeling over in the streets. Yes, the testing will reveal thousands of new cases. But those people will mostly have a mild form of it and they already know to stay home. 

Please don't bother quoting the experts. I am reading the Times' own reporting on what is actually happening (not just the dire predictions), and I think the reaction, shutting down the whole country, destroying people's livelihoods, is downright hysterical. Please have a little more skepticism. The press wants ratings and clicks and of course, to bring down Trump."
2020-03-18 14:54:34,"Trump's bizarre claim that he knew it was a pandemic early on is even more frightening and elucidating: If he is so prescient, why didn't he act sooner? Oh, I know why. He was anxious to see thousands become ill and die rather than intervene. One minute it's a pandemic, the next minute ""it's a hoax, folks."" This is the guy with the nuclear football. What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-03-18 15:09:05,We need a real leader in charge. Trump is not it. Who could have guessed that a multiple bankruptcy filer who could not keep his businesses operating would make such a botch up of our democratic process. He does not deserve a second term. He didn't deserve the first term and we are suffering for it. I miss No Drama Obama daily. This would not have occurred under him. He knew how to delegate and how to lead. I hope we survive.
2020-03-18 15:19:41,"His lack of warning and taking the lead is just one more example of a poor leader lacking morals, ethics, honesty and the list goes on.  This is just one more example of his inability to lead.  I personally don't believe anything he says.  May be poor judgement on my part but being in a leadership position for quite some time if my leadership skills resemble his I would not have survived as a leader!"

2020-03-18 15:18:40,"I feel it is worth noting that the market responded to his dismissive remarks by tanking, and the only upward blip was when he declared a state of emergency.  It was probably simply buying time for him and his cronies to divest while the divesting was good.  He has yet to say one inspiring thing to provide some level of hope and pride in this nation. To do so, he would need to string together a few sentences that neither elevated him above us or denigrate someone, something he is woefully ill-equipped to do.  We are a nation without a leader."

2020-03-18 14:49:11,"Prediction: when Trump is confronted with his incompetent mocking of the earlier reports on the coronavirus as a hoax by Democrats, then telling us he knew it would be a pandemic, here is what he will likely say.

""I always knew it was a pandemic. My earlier comments were all about trying to calm the American people and the stock market while working on a plan to thwart the virus.""

Trump's personal trainer during early ""adulthood"", Roy Cohn, coached his pupil — devoid of any critical thinking skills — on the benefits of massaging his ego, how to lie incessently to avoid facts, and how to blame his rivals for his own failings. 

And, BTW, I used the term, 'adulthood"" loosely. Donald Trump aged into a 6'3"" toddler with tendencies toward tantrums as an answer to all opposing opinions and comments.

Dr. Fauci continues to warn the rest of us, it will likely take 12-18 months to develop a cure for Covid-19. Once that cure is developed, the speed of manufacturing and distribution will be crucial. 

Maybe this will all pass by the end of summer, or the end of the year. One of my biggest worries is Trump demanding a delay in the general election. Voter suppression has already been successfully implemented by Republican leadership so, it will be essential for all eligible Americans to get out and vote. 

Trump wants to lead us into authoritarianism, crowning himself the monarch in charge.  Be furious! Demand change! Bring sanity back to governing! 

Vote blue, no matter who!"

Mr Limbaugh and others, knowingly spreading false information regarding this dreaded virus,place people in danger therefore should be arrested.Freedom of speech does not entitle anyone giving society false information.On Feb 24 it was common knowledge the corona virus was not  the ""common cold""but a very dangerous new virus that we knew nothing about."

I'm not a scientist but I do read about it for the clues it offers. Discoveries to date seem to confirm that the cosmologically  sudden occurrence of homo sapiens on our cozy little planet is - thus far - the most improbable event in the known Universe.

I'd have thought that an improving grasp of that fact and its implications would have given us a better, wider appreciation for the opportunities and hazards it presents. 

Where it does (all too rarely) occur, recognition of that reality has a stunning impact; awe, reverence, humility, gratitude and an acceptance of obligation ... to one another and to the biosphere. Scholars of the human psyche have called that the ascendance of the superego, as opposed to the self-centered dominance of the id and ego. The critical issue is the personal and cultural choices we make for the guidance and leaders we follow. That's why, with a few sacrificial exceptions, we get the leaders we deserve.

In that regard, this current crisis may be the stimulus required to pump up our very flat learning curve. We've been warned repeatedly: the Biosphere is angry. Are we, finally, scared? Good!"

operate by manipulating followers into a mindset by
which the sole truth is that which emanates from the dear leader, while anything heard from anyone else is not to be believed.

This offers a good example. He is   testing the strength of loyalty bonds out there in red   America, far from the contaminated urban blue areas. This test of fidelity
is  needed since all dear leaders are pathologically  insecure
about the subjects' loyalty.  This is why
they often challenge their membership with absurd
tests to insure and measure continued loyalty.

The loyalty test is also graded  within the cult itself. That is,  cult members themselves instill conformism to the 
sole source of Truth by peer pressure, fear of banishment  from a trusted community, denial of the one source of true beneficence, i.e., the wise compassionate gaze 
from dear leader. 

This example   fits the model. Dear leader
is challenging his cultists to a loyalty test. Were they to wander away into some zone of cognitive independence, with
whom could they  share their newfound freedom
of thought when their only trusted contacts are fellow cultists?  It is best to  swallow the kool aid yet again, i.e., what he says  will  now be my new truth. I remain 
part of the flock.

From outside the cult all this seems to be pathological lying. But  if the goal is to maintain group loyalty with November in mind, it is not difficult to decipher the underlying point."

NYT journalism is useful to keep track of the times; but the records are already settled for him; These pieces are fueling his campaign and making him stronger and not weaker in his constituency. He will never admit his faults publicly, he will never admit that he has done smth poorly ever and he will claim unreal facts and throw juicy accusations and maximize his screen time with these acts and eventually, he will win big time against boring, dull but truly civil servant minded leaders trying to play chess with him. This is the fallacy of democracy, you are governed by the average guy! The solution is the education of the average guy, but it takes to be more like Sweden to do that.

Can anyone cite one proposed suggestion for how to deal with a novel viral pandemic of the unit disbanded after four years of inaction. Even the man universally revered, Dr. Fauci, failed to imagine a novel viral pandemic. Let's get real: Other nations ( China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan saw it for what it was. Not us. Not even now as milllenials crowd the beaches of Florida, primaries ( three) went off as scheduled today!! Restaurants and bars remain open in Chicago.

President Obama noted at upon the onset of this flu on April 27th, 2009....""This is obviously a cause for concern ... but it is not a cause for alarm"".
Does anyone here recall chastising Obama for making that remark? Was his leadership questioned? Was Nero fiddling while Rome burned?
No, because its the job of the President to take control, but not cause a panic. 
We are currently at 6496 cases with just over 100 deaths. 
I dont seem to recall shutting down the entire economy during the swine flu. No panic in the streets. No empty shelves. Yet the swine flu infected 10,000 times more people, with 100 times more deaths. Seems to me certain local elected officials and their media cohorts are creating an unnecessary panic. Now they are shutting down construction sites. 
Local Democrat politicians and their media cohorts are taking their nod from Obama's former Chief of Staff, Rahm Emmanuel..

More than 40 million people live in CA and a little more 1,000 have been tested.

How did Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks get tested so quickly in Australia?

How did Trump get tested on the spot at the White House, along with other WH staffers?

Forget sending money to Americans.  Use tax payers dollars to create tests, fund labs, staff unemployment offices.

More than 40 million Californians and less than 700 people have tested positive, yet the entire state is shut down.

How much is hype?  

How much is government
mismanagement?

How much is being motivated by Republican politics?

Less than 1% of the country has the virus, but the country has shut down and we are in lock down?

Where is the leadership?"

I highly doubt he even knows how to spell the word, much less what it means.

But let's face it. The smartest guy in the room stated that he felt this was a pandemic ""long before it was called a pandemic"" while telling Americans weeks ago that ""the coronavirus risk in the U.S. is very low and that ""It will go away, just stay calm"".  That's Trump logic in a nutshell.

What's left for him to declare knowing well in advance of the entire world? A vaccine for this virus?

2020-03-18 16:11:19,"""Some of his critics have stretched his comment to suggest that he was calling the virus itself a hoax, but his supporters have argued that he was referring to the Democratic criticism, not the virus itself.""

I've watched the video of his comment several times. He was clearly calling the danger of the virus a hoax. A criticism is a criticism, a hoax is a hoax. They are not the same thing. His words, his demeanor, his attitude, and his delivery were all clear.  He announced to the world that the dangers of this virus was a hoax."
2020-03-18 16:13:52,"If Trump really knew it was going to be a pandemic, then, was he willfully encouraging people to believe in a miracle even go to work because he wanted COVID-19 to spread and last until November? Was he hoping against hope to prevent his eventual ouster?"

The truth matters, and despite Trump's own claims of his actions saving lives, and gratitude from the VP to the point of being gross. his actions were to deceive, play down the risks, ignore what the science knew from China, and blame Obama for the Trump administration gutting the National Security budget for pandemic responses.  He accepts no responsibility for us essentially still being blind to the actual risk.  Con job continues.

2020-03-18 19:06:40,"Trump, no kidding, is calling himself a ""wartime president."" Right. Like the old lawyer story of the boy who shoots his parents then asks the court for leniency because he's an orphan. Trump created the problem, now wants credit for fixing it."

When the real news is bad, they divert the conversation to the most insignificant topics possible, or they fall back on emails, which is good for laughs.  I wonder if their followers are as aware of the state of the entire world as they should be.  If not, maybe the repercussions they suffer will make them seek the truth."

Right now he's probably lying, just to make himself look smarter than the scientists.  But let's say he's telling the truth now and he was lying back then -- that would mean he knew all along what kind of danger we were in and he decided to keep us in the dark.  If that is not criminal behavior from a president, I don't know what is."

You're seeing America finally immunized against a dangerous vanity fair.

The presidency of our great nation can defend itself against the functional absence of a genuine president."

From npr.org
In February, a little more than a quarter of U.S. adults believed the coronavirus was being blown out of proportion. Now, that number has risen to nearly 40% of respondents.

Pollsters found that both shifts are  driven by changes in opinion by Republicans. For instance, 72% of Republicans saw the coronavirus as a real threat in early February, but that figure has now plummeted to 40% of Republicans now believing the deadly virus is a serious menace.

And a majority of Republicans — 54% — now say the response to the coronavirus is overblown, a significant jump from last month, when about 23% of Republicans held that view.


Fewer independents, too, see the coronavirus as a real threat. Fifty percent of them view it as such now, compared with 64% of independents last month who said the virus was legitimately threatening.

Democrats remained the most unchanged on this question. An increasing number of them — 76% — now say the danger of the coronavirus is real, up from 70% last month."
2020-03-18 18:03:37,"If this is the case, then he sat around and did nothing but downplay a pandemic he knew was coming, instead of ordering more hospital masks, social distancing, and enabling supplies sooner?  Why would anyone aware of a coming pandemic do nothing for 7 - 10 days?"

I do not trust much of what he has to say.  All I see and hear are a bunch of people trying to clarify our situation for the public behind some kind of prior Trump aggrandizing statement...as if he has any clear idea of what is going on or any clue of what to do.

Now he says that things would be better for us ""if China had given us earlier notice""...Covid-19 has been in the news since September 2019...Trump is trying to coverup his dismissal of this pandemic even though he and his administration had ample time to prepare.

We are now behind the 8 ball...."

Our own National Intelligence Agency, had he cared to attend or God forbid read the reports warned of a pandemic.  Trump aka The Chosen One cared more about the Stock Market than the American people.  He has dragged his feet on testing, dragged his feet on accepting responsibility for the FACT that the USA squandered 6 weeks of preparation in his denials of the facts.  He continues to drag his feet on seeing up field hospitals.  Thankfully the Governor's are stepping up and the ""Fool on the Hill"" twiddles his chubby little fingers."

Now, with this Covid-19 pandemic, the only things that seem to have gotten his attention is that the economy is tanking, and that he himself had to be tested.  God save us!"

If you want proof, listen to Limbaugh/Hannity/etc. as they create and propagate increasingly bizarre and intricate conspiracy theories (some of them going back 20 years) to contradict observable facts and justify their support of trump.

2020-03-18 20:24:56,"As an older American at greater risk to the Corona Virus, I take solace in the fact that Donald Trump has finally acknowledged the severity of this pandemic despite over two months of his denials, deflections and disparagement of those who earlier warned him of the danger.  How many lives might have been saved had Donald Trump acknowledged the risk posed by the Corona Virus in January and taken the same actions then as he is taking now?  

Even though Donald Trump has now seeming acknowledged the severity of the Corona Virus, he and his advisers are treating this as a financial crisis rather than a health crisis.  Yes, the Corona Virus has severely impacted our economy and will likely do so for the foreseeable future.  But, unless and until we can reduce the spread of this virus, the economy will suffer regardless of the amount of stimulus being applied.  

Effective leadership in a time of crisis requires intelligence, integrity, expertise, and empathy, character traits that Donald Trump does not have and never did.  Fortunately, many of our state governors, such as Andrew Cuomo of New York, Jay Inslee of Washington State, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, just to name a few, have stepped up and provided the kind of leadership sorely lacking in Washington D.C.  The Federal Government needs to give them the support and resources they need, and we will survive this crisis."

The fact is he wanted to wish it away and purposely downplayed it for his own political reasons. Trump was afraid that if he had been honest, it would adversely impact the economy and the stock market. Trump really only viwed this health crisis through self serving political lens. Now he wants to act as if he had brilliantly acted. The fact and truth is Trump waited at least two to three months to plan and take needed actions. All evidence of his incompetrnce to be our president."

This means he is acknowledging he was flat out lying when he said it would disappear, when he said it was a hoax, when he said it was no different than ordinary flu.

This man is so anxious to appear right and on top of things that he fails to realize the importance of maintaining a storyline about oneself.  What a frightening leader for such an unnerving time."

He must think enough of the world is made-up of such dimwits so he can lie compulsively and get away with it. So far it appears to be working, as over 40% of the population polled still ""have confidence"" in his crisis management.

We should have manufacturing of essential items here in the US, government run if necessary.   You can't save people by being prepared on a Republican small government platform.  In fact, I'd argue that the Republican party is now so twisted, amoral and corrupt (looking at you, Nunes, Moscow Mitch and Graham...), so far from what it once was, that it needs to just fully die out and be replaced by a third party.  What ever happened to separation of State and Church?  The Republican Party gave us Trump.  In the face of Impeachment, it kept Trump.  Now we're neck deep in a pandemic, we have them to thank for our shamefully inept and slow response."

2020-03-18 19:49:50,"Can just one Republican member of Congress - just one (besides Romney) take a stand 
against one or more of Trump’s BIGGEST missteps? This claim of being the first to label this virus a pandemic? Or at least denouncing his willingness to put hundreds of thousands of Americans (of Chinese heritage) in physical danger by using and encouraging the use of “Chinese Virus” and even “Kung Flu”? What are you so afraid of? Don’t you realize how badly history will treat your legacy? If not worried about that, how about how poorly some of your own family members and close friends will view you? Here’s your big chance to do the right thing! You can even go on supporting this ignorant blowhard’s candidacy if you believe in it. No problem! Just call him out on the big and obvious dangerous lies and statements."
2020-03-18 16:10:07,"None of this would be happening if Hillary Rodham Clinton had been elected President.

Trump's rhetorical wars with the rest of the world – with China in particular – and his dismantling of the State department and the pandemic preparedness office caused this. 

A Hillary Rodham Clinton White House would have had a team on the ground in Wuhan immediately, much like the Obama administration responded to the Ebola outbreak."
2020-03-18 21:08:30,"As everyone already knows, Trump is either on or off.  When he's off he's sleeping and when he's on he is laser focused on self-promotion.  His entire being for decades solely has been self-promotion. He knows absolutely nothing about anything except self-promotion and he has found a very thirsty crowd for it in this country unfortunately."
2020-03-18 21:13:02,"An minute now, I expect Trump to take credit for lessening air pollution..."
2020-03-18 21:11:14,"This headline looks like gossip passed around in a middle school cafeteria, sadly, with 2000+ ""adults"" joining in. Who cares what he said or when he knew. Was he clueless or was he averting panic? I just don't care. 

Clearly we have had it too good for too long. We don't know how or when to be serious, and this is what will kill us all. It is frightening that the perennially disgruntled are still, not so secretly, hoping Trump will fail. 

We have a serious problem of no one's making. There is no playbook for it, and that is both everyone's and no ones's fault. Hindsight still has 20/20 vision or does everyone really believe they are just smarter than everyone else? 

Will those who must lead us through this be helped by our petty observations, ill will, and second guessing? Bloomberg (or Musk or Buffet or ...) could put his organizational skills and billions to work on this, but why bother? The press and the their outraged audience would work the angles until they tore their efforts to shreds. It's our national pastime.

This is not a movie and we are not watching from afar. We are in it, and it is time to get serious. For the sake of our children, our parents, and our nation, it is time to put vindictiveness aside so that we can think carefully and creatively, and work cooperatively to weather the pandemic, and while we are at it, let's encourage the press to report the news without creating it."
2020-03-18 21:15:53,"I really wish some of these supposedly intelligent people would simply call out this lying, ignorant fool, and just walk away. Sure, some of them would likely lose their jobs, but at what point does one finally draw the line?"
2020-03-18 21:58:38,"A free press has always been vital in democratic counties, especially the United States, since it’s founding.  

The current president, an appointed servant of Russia, through a manipulated election, lies, cheats and subverts this country every single day.

The press, can’t even call this man a liar to his face, let alone ask him why he continually lies.  Apparently, the Old Gray Lady, once a great newspaper, is past asking this man a simple question;  why do you lie to the American people on a daily basis?  

Trump is destroying this “once great” country for personal gains.  

The New York Times used to questions these kinds of problems.  Apparently, they are now too timid to ask the question that people want to hear.

“All the news that’s fit to print.”  Not anymore.  Only the news to insure that the stock holders aren’t upset, and they make money.

Once a great newspaper, now just a mediocre, politically correct rag."
2020-03-18 22:16:18,"At some point it may alarm Americans in this crisis that this President creates his own reality on a daily if hourly basis. His statements on video cratradict the latest lie about Trump knowing COVID19 it was a ""pandemic"" before anyone was stark and obvious distortion of recorded history but our Fourth Estate refrains from noting the obvious- someone who recreates reality on a random basis should not have access to the nuclear codes or lead an attack against a virus he has in Nazi Propaganda style called the ""Chinese Virus"", a disgraceful appeal to prejudice and race. Trump is a liar of unstable delusions of grandeur like many autocrats in history and attacks the 'Fake News"" just as Hitler attacked the ""Lying Press"". Trump is a clear and present danger to our Republic- he is incapable of relating the truth."
2020-03-18 22:50:44,"I guess I’m not sure why this is an important article. It’s seems like there would be better use for the time and space to help, not just bash away. Come on NYT, you can do better."

2020-03-18 22:07:55,Then his inaction and lack of leadership back then makes him liable for that is transpiring now and magnifies his incompetence..
2020-03-18 22:11:38,"Guess that makes him even with the Democrats and the NY Times who accused him of racism and xenophobia when he first declared a ban on anyone other than US nationals entering the country back in January after an unidentified flu-like virus was reported spreading from Wuhan, China.  Any objections to banning entries from Europe?  Racism against Europeans this time, maybe?

Wonder who has a larger memory black hole: Trump or Democrats and their media mouthpieces?

Oh, and the new Dem schtick is claiming the term ""Wuhan Virus"" is racist.  Nevermind the TDS media had no problem with the name just a few short weeks ago.  Nevermind it's been standard practice to name diseases after the geographic area where they were first reported, e.g. Ebola (river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Spanish Flu, German Measles, Zika (forest in Uganda) Virus.  But if it's Trump, it becomes a new reason to lose one's mind. And be sanctimonious about it."

2020-03-18 21:37:22,"Anyone notice that over the past two days, Trump is acting like a deer that's been caught in the headlights? Yeah, thought so. Somebody finally had the guts to tell him that coronavirus has mostly been detected among Republicans. Actually, virtually all cases are among the MAGA bunch. Trump likely assumes it's the ""wrath of God"" to punish him, like one of the ten plagues against pharaoh. Will the intracoastal waterway at Palm Beach turn to blood next? And what after that?"

2020-03-18 21:47:48,"Trump deserves to have the virus named after him:  the 21st Century Trump Virus.  Most Americans would accept this. 
 
Trump and his supporters will recognize his clairvoyance in predicting the pandemic and his very stable genius in leading us through what Trump called an invisible war.

Others familiar with his earlier statements would blame him for being late and incompetent handling.

The Trump virus becomes a perfect double entendre, acceptable to all."
2020-03-18 22:21:27,It worries me if Trump gets reelected after this COVID-19 pandemic. We have witnessed the worst performance by any president during crisis.  It is pale in comparison to Bush in 911 and Obama during financial crisis.   Please gives us Biden.
2020-03-18 22:57:08,Trump's attempts to rewrite history are reminiscent of the Soviet Union in its heyday.
2020-03-18 21:27:40,The mental state of this country can better be served if those who know the facts ( i.e Dr. Faucci ) give one 2 minute report daily.  The hourly tweets and special news conferences by terrific Donnie and praying Pence ... both full of contradictions and uneducated posturing... should be banned immediately. More harmful  misinformation from the wrong sources than can be handled intelligently is drowning us with confusion.
2020-03-18 21:36:17,I want the DNC to start running political ads relentlessly featuring trump and disastrous handling of the crisis.
2020-03-18 17:46:39,So why are we still so scared of the pandemic when China got away with 80000 known cases and 5000 deaths? Shouldn’t we all be relieved that public health measures and locally necessary lock downs will mitigate the spread quickly? Why predict the apocalypse on insufficient modeling when we actually just have to adopt what China did? At this moment the panic certainly will cause more damage than the virus. People and health care experts have to get a grip on reality.
2020-03-18 18:21:34,"China good actions deserves praise.  The US needs to reflect on its failure to produce enough tests even for its own population, its inability to plan for a ""surge"" in basic model ventilators, and in general be capable of manufacturing necessary goods  in an emergency situation, not only for ourselves but for others also."
2020-03-18 18:55:07,"Well, it’s only right that China tries to lend aid, seeing how its leaders were at fault for not acknowledging it in the first place, leading to deaths in their country and now devastation around the globe. (but no, contrary to Trump’s claim, it is NOT the ‘Chinese virus’).
It is very likely self-interested (building back PR and their role in the market, now that many countries are questioning the wisdom of over-reliance on Chinese manufacturing), but if it means tangible aid in the form of health supplies etc, then why not ?
In a time where existing divisions are further exarcebated by this pandemic, any collaborative effort to make progress is welcome!"
2020-03-18 19:34:53,"Ah, the story of masks.  On the ground here in Shanghai, surgical masks went from highly coveted items the day after the Wuhan shutdown was announced, completely gone from shelves, to government rationed and distributed (5 per household per week), to stumbling blocks to business reopening (most need to give them to their employees every day), to back on shelves for maybe $5 for 10 as of today in stores.  99% of people on the street wear a mask of some kind, and I am convinced that this is major reason why there have only been 360 infections or so in this megacity of 25 million.  And why I could walk around the French Concession today and see crowds of shoppers and diners again.

No, masks won't protect 100% of the time because their pores are larger than viral particles, but they do add some protection, especially when everyone wears one. In the age of coronavirus, everyone in the world needs to get into a habit of wearing one for a while when in public.

Also, I agree that it's time for China to export masks massively, since there honestly won't be much demand for much else for a while.  And to manufacture them in the US is relatively easy - any climate controlled, air filtered plant can do this, and I've heard from a sanitary pad manufacturer who switched to masks last month that the assembly line machines cost about $100k and make a few hundred masks a minute."
2020-03-18 19:56:06,"The help is welcome. So let's welcome it. We have more than our hands full here; no shame in other countries who can stepping up. I'd say they took their hit, for sure, and they have much to make up for having blown this in the first place.

Us? We had their example, and we STILL blew it."
2020-03-18 17:54:18,"Now that they exported the plague, they want to play the savior.  The West needs to stand together against the fascist Chinese regime.  The US needs to officially recognize Taiwan as an independent country, and establish an official relationship between the two."

2020-03-18 19:22:15,"I would have more appreciated the Chinese putting the same amount of effort into closing down the live animal markets in their country that led to this outbreak. 

And, this reminds me of a quote from Apocalypse Now:

Willard:   “It was the way we had over here of living with ourselves. We’d cut them in half with a machine gun and give them a Band-Aid. It was a lie—and the more I saw of them, the more I hated lies.”"
2020-03-18 18:39:48,"“One of China’s leading entrepreneurs, Jack Ma, offered to donate 500,000 tests and one million masks to the United States, where hospitals are facing shortages despite having weeks of notice to prepare. In February, the United States flew in 17 tons of supplies to Wuhan aboard four flights that evacuated Americans from the city.”

Interesting, never knew that America offered this assistance, before when we ourselves are so woefully unprepared and under supplied, but I am glad we helped China when they were in crisis, and I hope that the Chinese SHAARE CRUCIAL INFORMATION WITH THE US AND REST OF THE WORLD, AND HE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY  about key discoveries of the virus - that should be a key aspect of building trust too - as the saying goes “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.”

Providing essentials are good, but should go hand in hand with giving full disclosure of scientific nd medical discoveries about tackling this virus!!!!!

Hold them accountable."

2020-03-18 18:54:39,"This is like committing arson and offering a bucket of water to douse a raging inferno. Given the emergency, countries should take whatever China is giving away. But they should never forget China caused this global calamity. When the dust settles, China should become a global pariah. Corporates and consumers globally should insist production and supply chains shift away. Xi Jinping wanted to be another Mao, and he’s fast achieving a similar death toll."
2020-03-18 18:22:20,China offering to help countries around the world with the coronavirus is like auto glass repair shop employees breaking windshields and then passing out their business cards.

2020-03-18 17:57:48,"During the years of “Great Leap” in China some seventy years ago, there were twenty millions (or many more) of Chinese people died of famine. At the same time, they exports grains to Africa. Similarity?"
2020-03-18 18:38:33,"We have to look at ourselves in the mirror now. Where were we in January? We were drinking beer and laughing at China how they handled the pandemic. Not only did we not act like a world leader helping S. Korea and European countries, we did nothing to get ourselves prepared, absolutely nothing! Trump is not the only person to blame. Where was the warning from the CDC and NIH? We refused to use test kits offered by WHO while our own test kit was a joke. Who is responsible for that? Are we really the best? You are kidding!
I hope we are not the sickest man in the world!"
2020-03-18 20:13:57,If China is declining that quickly—which no one expected—why can’t the US do the same?
2020-03-18 19:16:11,"China runs the risk of global ostracizing for its third or fourth pandemic. This is good PR as much as it is good will. They can also be generous with supplies and people because they are on the other side of the outbreak. How can the US or West offer support when we in the beginning to middle of their own crisis. 
China should be offering their plans on how they are going to prevent these animal born viruses from continually generating from with in their boarders"
2020-03-18 20:17:26,"Of course China should lend aid to countries. Other countries are just coming to where the Chinese communist  government was in December when they brutally suppressed information, denied human to human transmission, denied the scientists the opportunity to share findings with the global community and allowed 40,000 people to share a New Year's banquet before they dispersed. The record of the Chinese government was appalling and irresponsible. The result is global death and economic destruction. Thank goodness the NYT, WaPo, and WSJ exist. I hope in do time all Americans will read the account. The global community needs to know governments won't be allowed to act recklessly in future early stages of viral infections."
2020-03-18 18:00:51,Almost everybody in Bulgaria and many greek friends that I know are awestruck by the gesture of the Chinese to give lifesaving machines to the Italians especially after the refusal of Merkel and her cronies to help.I bet you every government on Earth has taken note of it and will be very careful to be on the right side of the Chinese politburo. So it seems whoever has the manufacturer base rules.
2020-03-18 18:21:07,"Let me be unflinchingly clear on this, CHINA IS NOT OUR FRIEND.  They are the ones who started this pandemic, they are the ones who suppressed journalists back in NOVEMBER who wanted to go public about the virus, they are the ones who allowed 5  million people to leave the Wuhan area when they KNEW it was spreading. They are the ENEMY. The appropriate response is to isolate them NOW; economically, politically, and corporately. End ALL interaction with China NOW."

2020-03-18 19:23:07,"China's entire response to this has been a disaster. The fact that they are spinning narratives now should not distract us from the fact that they hid the disease, its seriousness, and have tried to shift the blame for the disease to the US. 

As the country continues to expel journalists that were exposing their horrific response, it's hard to take anything they say seriously."
2020-03-18 18:27:10,"This global pandemic could have been avoided if the Chinese government simply enforced poor food sanitation.  The Chinese government needs to get their act together and should not be rewarded for playing the hero in a crisis of their own doing.  It is time for the rest of the world to impose economic sanctions on China until they implement/enforce strict regulations on food sanitation.  This should have never happened and yet similar things have happened in the past like SARS.  What assurances do we have from the Chinese government that they won't inadvertently cause another pandemic?!  The world needs to push back against China, instead of treating them like they're doing us a favor.  Keep in mind being tough on China has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with calling out an authoritarian government that's unwittingly unleashed a weapon of bio-mass destruction on the world."
2020-03-18 19:46:04,"""authoritarian incubator of a pandemic""

Sigh. There are a dozen different ways this sentence could have been written that conveyed all of the information in this sentence, without dripping in venom. ""Incubator"" connotates a petri dish, where one intentionally cultivates a disease. You could've used epicenter, which is both factually correct, and also less dehumanizing. The media loves to parrot talking points and say, ""No, we didn't say that; we're just reporting on OTHER people saying that,"" but at the end of the day, you need to take responsibility for the words that pass your desks.

The Chinese government messed up, big time. And now they're trying to help clean up the mess. As humans, we should be nuanced enough to understand that people--and governments-- can do both bad and good, our government included. And that people-- both in China, the US, literally everywhere in this world-- are seldom their governments."
2020-03-18 20:26:10,"It is the US who constantly claims to be the world leaders and the only superpower in the world. China has never claim to be the world leader in any press release and it is the title crowned by the US out of ineptness of their gunboat diplomacy in facing the epidemic.

2020-03-18 18:55:29,"Given the aggressive way that the Chinese government is suppressing news about the Covid-19 epidemic within China, we have no way to know whether or not things really are getting much better there.  We should face the possibility that sending goods and supplies of any kind from China to other places will have the effect of spreading the virus.  We also should face the certainty that current international supply vectors mean that neither China nor the rest of the world can get by economically without a large amount of trade taking please between China and other countries, regardless of whether or not that trade spreads the virus."
2020-03-18 19:55:26,"China made the right political decision some weeks ago: victory against the virus was necessary to rescue the economy and the political party. So the virus epidemic was declared over. No cases any more. No tests any more. Some people die due to other causes, like pneumonia, like every year, no problem. Some old people die like every year in winter time, no problem. May be we in the west should learn from Chinese wisdom and take the same road instead driving our democracies and economies right into the abyss."
2020-03-18 17:40:47,"Far from any praise on the Chinese government, the Chinese government should be punished severely for the threat it’s unleashed on the world. It stood by and did little (if anything) as its citizens continued to consume dead and live animals from China’s popular wet markets. It fully understood the threat posed by this practice and did little if anything to stop it. An example (of many) of studies covering this issue is an article from 2014 in the International Journal of Infectious Disease can be found online and is called “Major emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China: a matter of global health and socioeconomic development for 1.3 billion.” In addition, the Chinese government suppressed initial reports of the disease, further complicating the response from the West. The help of the Chinese government now is kind of like cutting off someone’s leg and then giving that person a Band-Aid."
2020-03-18 18:00:39,"Will China crack down on the illicit wildlife trade that is arguably at the heart of this whole debacle? Will they denounce traditional Chinese medicine, which sustains the illicit wildlife trade?

However, history tells us that over time, people will start to forget."

Of course, restarting the Chinese factories might (re)ignite viral spread in regions that were spared during Wuhan's shutdown. Time will tell."
2020-03-18 20:56:33,"This epidemic is pregnant with progress for China, contingent on the US government following the well trodden path of deficit spending to cope,  instead of raising taxes, like in wartime. 

The fact of the matter is that China’s meteoric rise to the status of premier manufacturing power in the world is strongly correlated with American deficit spending. 

This epidemic will be a double happiness for China. Consumer demand for Chinese goods will be hit, but the manufacturing capacity will be still there. The clever Chinese will use that surplus capacity to satisfy unmet wants in Africa and elsewhere, of which there is plenty, in exchange for valuable raw materials landed at Chinese ports, without spending US dollars even.

I wonder if the deficit merchants will ever wake up, before it’s too late?"
2020-03-18 20:57:41,"The US China rivalry is something that will continue to unfold in a time scale of decades, if not centuries. This pandemic is a global health emergency that probably will complete its course in a much shorter time scale, perhaps, in a few months. Lives are at stake here. If the political leaders in this country are wise enough, they should prioritize work in front of them. Use some help from China, and worry about the rivalry later. Life first."

They will paint the best picture.  The Virus isn't handled yet till the world has an active vaccine that staves it off, it could be like  the Flu of 1918, that came back twice more to wreck havoc.

While they are pushing the propaganda to the extreme, don't fall for the narrative that all is fine and dandy.  Though the walking infected are still an issue world wide, we are still at risk, of it coming back even if it seems to end, before the vaccine is ready.

I'd hope people now are better informed about how bad viruses can be on our lacking health care systems."
2020-03-18 21:53:40,"Honestly, I don't know if I trust the numbers they are pushing. It seems improbable that they are handling the situation so well even with the strong measures they are taking. I guess it is okay to be skeptic of the information that comes from an authoritarian country, which is now behaving in a full propaganda mode."
2020-03-18 22:03:27,"No point in trying to compare responses by China or America. Both had some difficulties-but the future is what we should think about. Considering the huge population of China-particularly the large cities-China has rebounded very well. They will do what is necessary to retain and enhance EU ties, Remember that the Belt and Road initiative was growing before the corona virus hit them. China is already well positioned in Africa where the pandemic will grow next.

Good economic sense would tell us that tariffs should be eliminated-all the Trump tariffs should be dropped against Chinese and US goods and these countries should do the same against US goods. Trump tariffs are a major factor before corona in weakening the US economy. America must understand China is not going away and better minds than Trump must take control to get him out of the picture. This is not the time to compete ideologically but compete within the parameters of global economies where all can do well if tariffs are dropped. 

After corona, countries will unite with China to form a world trading bloc if Trump is still in office and continues with tariffs. America will find it hard to resurrect their economy under those conditions."
2020-03-18 20:29:41,"Xi and China could do the region a big favor by helping its (now self-admittedly) primitive and woefully incapable client and neighbor North Korea, with millions at risk and nothing to do about it but substitute Japan Sea rocket launches and nuke-building for medical care.  For all the Vogue-posing by Kim and Trump, it was outward facing China that pulled Kim's leash short with economic sanctions a couple of years go and antagonized China that has freed him back up for current mischief.  COVID-19 relief should be on the basis of a return to civilized behavior by China's puppet boy."
2020-03-18 20:33:55,"Now that China has the means, let the Chinese people contribute more to the well beings of humanity. 

There is always a price for everything. If the help from the Chinese government comes with a string to strip off my personal freedom, I will resort to  Patrick Henry.

Otherwise, I say, thank you."
2020-03-18 21:07:46,"Oh please! The whole thing started in their country. This is re. The Chinese government.  They tried to hush it up. And treated the poor doctor who sounded the alarm (and then tragically, died) as an outcast. 
It’s the least the Chinese government can do."
2020-03-18 21:19:05,"Why are we taking China's reported numbers as being true?  They have always manipulated their public reports, on all topics, to serve their political ends."
2020-03-18 21:31:35,"The story should include how Chinese government failed to act in time to contain the virus. 
It should also include how the rest of the world failed to act in time, despite free press, full knowledge of the danger of the virus, and the extreme measures by Chinese government, to contain the virus. 
It should also include all the racism and sinophobia that have been prevalent in every western media report since the outbreak, including the NYTimes (e.g. would NYTimes let the President get away with calling AIDS or Ebola the ""Africa Virus""?).
Considering how the rest of the world remained hopelessly inactive while hauling all kinds of insults at the Chinese at a time when they could have done something themselves, I don't see where the expectation of ""China should take care of this mess"" comes from. 
True, had the Chinese government handled the situation correctly, there would not have been a global pandemic. But the same could be said for the rest of the world: had the rest of the world handled the situation correctly (and they are in a much better position to do so), there would not have been a global pandemic either."
2020-03-18 21:44:22,"This whole problem lies at the feet of the PRC. Also, no we are not going to have autocracy at least not here. Perhaps this is the wake up call the US needs. The PRC is our opponent on all fronts. Its vaunted miracle was due to US elites passing PTNR and WTO for China as well as massive IP theft. The US should take direct steps to force onshoring with incentives and penalties. Rebuild, push the rare earth mine in CA and lock in deals with Greenland. Block PRC investment, revoke student visas, shut down the Confucius society and when it is done shut the trade door. I am as progressive as you can get, studied China since '76 under one of Chalmer Johnson's mentees and am tired of the vast mistake we made.  Also, I would not place much trust in any data from the PRC."
2020-03-18 21:07:23,"They were right and we were wrong but there is no help for us.
1- After spending months criticizing,  mocking and bashing China at every turn around the COVID epidemic, it is very difficult for Americans to  admit that we were wrong and to follow the example set by China.
2- Though crow could be eaten,  there remains a bigger problem.  Remember why NYC had such a hard time committing to school closure? A major concern was  not about education, but food, that kids might go hungry without school. When I learned that, I finally understood why China's response to this epidemic seemed so alien and unfathomable to us. It is because such a response is literally out of our reach .We lack the safety net, infrastructure and even sense of community that would be required.  We have been exposed as a house of cards and there is every reason to be scared.

Though at this point, anything is better than nothing. I hope they will send some surplus our way..."
2020-03-18 21:31:30,"So tired of the endless comments about how China ""started it"" and should compensate the world. 

In all fairness, when a single country contains about 20% of the world's people, odds are in favor of infectious diseases arising there. To help you understand, are you more likely to find one person who loves anchovy pizza in a group of 5 or a group of 5000? Now, these odds don't work for everything. For example, if you get a bomb dropped on your country, it probably did *not* come from China."
2020-03-18 20:30:13,"Our apologies to those in need in the world, our president can't even deliver test kits here at home.

The coronavirus is only a speed bump in their plan to be the super power in 10-20 years. The seeds are planted in the Belts and Bridges program. Their efforts to assist are welcome because the US has failed to protect its position in the world. Say 'thank you"" today and learn Chinese tomorrow."

To insinuate China as a 'humanitarian' moral leader in the world at the moment is factually wrong and simply inane. It is one of the last things but 'humanitarian', and to label it as such is deeply ignorant and distorts the ongoing inhumane practices by the government.
And yes it is right that the Chinese government gives 'aid' to the Western countries suffering at the moment; after all this virus ORIGINATES from China, exported to the rest of the world by its colossal human capital. China must provide assistance to the countries suffering as a result of its own poor hygiene infrastructure."

It's outrageous for Jack Ma to send corvid-19 test kits and masks to USA. Who is he fooling? What an insult to American prowess in technology and medicine. Jack Ma has no regard for American pride. If Wuhan virus Pompeo has any dignity he should immediate send them back publicly. Right away.

Assume Steven Lee Myers and other NY Times reporters stationed in China will be packing up soon. They are returning to USA's safe harbors, aren't they?

Spare me the tired rants about wet markets. China has demonstrated an amazing ability to effectively deal with a huge and novel threat. Boy, did they show us how to do it. But there's more. We, can't emulate them (spare me about how we don't want to, because we're ""free"" etc.) in mobilizing an effective response because we simply can't. What they did is out of our reach.

2020-03-18 22:35:55,"While many in the U.S. have been focused on internal policy strife and Trump, the Chinese over the past decade have moved very quickly into voids left open by Western Democracies.

As evidence, one only need look at the huge inroads the Chinese have made on the African continent. They’ve built highways connecting once disconnected areas and are bringing products to those markets and employing local residents. 

They’ve also reconstituted several major shortwave radio transmitters and other media delivery platforms so they can reach and talk to those populations at the flip of a switch.

What has the U.S. done to counter that? Nothing! In fact, we have shutdown many overseas shortwave operations and other media outlets under the pretense of budgets and the nonsense that everybody has an internet connection, and that last fact is hogwash when you look at how many people in the U.S. don’t have access.

We also need to have the conversation about the Chinese culture - live animal markets, bats, etc -  that gave rise to this virus.

Doctors have died and disappeared, and as the CCP sent proof of the virus down the memory hole in December, 2019, according to the London Times (3/1/20).

2020-03-19 00:18:26,"Again, as with almost all NYT articles about China, the writers cannot resist second-guessing the motives of the Chinese government in negative ways, persisting in assuming the worst, whether explicitly or in terms of the adjectives used to describe actions.

What this reveals is a deep uncertainty and fear in the US about a future where the US is no longer the main player. Trump has accelerated this, but it was happening anyway. The myth of American exceptionalism is evaporating and the US is going to have to acknowledge that other systems of government exist and can thrive and that there are flaws in every system. Those of the US have been on display in recent years. 

I came to this realisation slowly, having lived in the West (UK, Germany and US) for most of my life. Living in HK is like living in a little Western enclave, but it provides insights into mainland China and sources of information that are missing to those who only read the Western press. 

My understanding has solidified through the events of the civil unrest in Hong Kong, and now Covid-19. NYT often has the facts right, but the interpretation is almost unrelentingly negative, twisting everything. 

Illegal, violent (and, frankly, undemocratic) protests in HK, fuelled by fear and misinformation, are recast as brave resisters to an autocracy (not actually existing in HK). Failures in local management in Wuhan is recast as sinister activity. And on and on. 

And now this. No good deed goes unpunished."

Going along with that is political repression, suppression of dissent, absence of personal freedoms and rule of law, no free press, no freedom of religion and high level government corruption. 
Not to mention the whole no democracy thing.

-January 15: Pelosi and House Democrats celebrate the “solemn” occasion with a signing ceremony, using commemorative pens.
-January 21: The first person with coronavirus arrives in the United States from China.
-January 23: The House impeachment managers make their opening arguments for removing President Trump.

-January 31: The Senate holds a vote on whether to allow further witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial.
-January 31: President Trump declares a national health emergency and imposes a ban on travel to and from China. Former Vice President Joe Biden calls Trump’s decision “hysterical xenophobia … and fear-mongering.”
-February 4: President Trump talks about coronavirus in his State of the Union address; Pelosi rips up every page.
-February 5: The Senate votes to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment, 52-48 and 53-47.
-February 5: House Democrats finally take up coronavirus in the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia."
2020-03-19 00:22:40,"I’m very disappointed to see that even NYT readers blamed Chinese government for the current situation purely based on their political belief. Do you believe Trump administration would perform better if the virus was originated in US? Even Obama administration was not able to prevent the H1N1 pandemic.

Yes Chinese government did block/censor the information in the early days (though mostly by the incapable local governments whose mayor and governor already got fired) but also they shared the DNA sequence of corona virus with WHO on Jan 12 (what has US done since then?) and did everything to contain the virus for the next two months. Given how badly it’s still spreading all over the world MORE THAN A MONTH after the world aware of the situation in China, it is foolish to say the world would be in peace now IF Chinese government did better in the early days (otherwise other “free” countries should be able to contain the virus). 

For those who don’t believe in China’s current numbers - how can China remove the lockdown policy and allow people to travel (still some restriction in Wuhan) if the situation is still bad? No one including Trump can talk down and hide the number of infection / death in a pandemic."
2020-03-19 00:21:26,"The NYTimes continue to push the lie that China “mishandled” the coronavirus when it the first appears. In reality, Chinese authorities rapidly responded to the threat and rigorously implemented science-based policy, which is why the epidemic is at an end in China but flaring in the rest of the world.

Observe the following:
1. Chinese doctors first recognized that a series of unexplained pneumonia was caused by a new virus on Dec. 30, 2019. The WHO was notified on Dec. 31. So China did not “keep the virus a secret” in any way.

2. Chinese scientists isolated and sequenced the genome of the virus on Jan. 12 and promptly designed a test based on the result, administering the test to millions in less than a month. Compare this to the US, which has the test recipe readily available, chooses to make its own, fails miserably, and has now tested a fraction of what it should have.

3. The Chinese government locked down Wuhan when there were only 200 confirmed cases and a handful of deaths. At the time, the infectiousness and lethality of the virus were not known, but Chinese authorities chose to act decisively. Compare this to Europe, which didn’t act until several thousands of patients were in all major EU countries, even when the high lethality is well understood.

While the Wuhan government had not acted perfectly IN HINDSIGHT, its actions were appropriate given the lack of information in the early stage of the epidemic—and much better than any countries in the West."
2020-03-19 00:34:50,"It is time China came clean about how all this started. Are we really expected to be that gullible to believe this started with a bat in a food market - when Wuhan hosts 42 Pharma company and hosts the laboratory is the only declared laboratory site in China capable of working with deadly viruses. Who accidentally dropped the test tube? COVID-19 targets certain susceptible individuals and especially the elderly. Sacrificial lambs in the land of overpopulation. Remember this was the same country that when building the 3 gorges dam had more than 1.2 million people displaced and the number of cities and towns flooded 13 cities, 140 towns, 1,350 villages - and the death toll from that venture was never disclosed.
Why are international journalists being expelled?

The only thing you will remember, when the suffering ends, is who helped you and who did not. When this crisis is over, the world will not be the same place as it was before. The US blew its best chance to shore up all the relationships it dismissed in the last 3 years, and pushed them all towards China."
2020-03-19 00:35:25,"When the coronavirus first broke, the NYT was filled with stories criticizing and attacking China's response. Now that China has the disease under control and Western powers - especially the US - have proven grossly, spectacularly incompetent in dealing with a virus that they had months for which to prepare, is it any wonder that the Chinese are reacting with ""schadenfreude""? Moreover, what is the point of this story? China is helping the world, and helping it deal with a problem that it helped to create. When the West acts in this way - providing aid, for example, that requires the receiving state buy goods from the West- this viewed by the Western media as unworthy of commentary. When China does it, it is not only sinister, but the fact that China is simply following the lead of Western states goes unremarked. I get it that the Western media reflects the biases and prejudices of Western culture and governments, but do they really have to be so obvious about it? As the Chinese have said, there are lots of problems in the world that are going to require international cooperation. This is one of them. So is climate change. Moreover, China is becoming a much more powerful nation in the world. It deserves a level of recognition and respect commensurate with that reality. The real problem here is the refusal of the US to accept that reality."
2020-03-19 00:38:19,"Thank goodness there's another country out there willing to step in and take the lead in fighting this virus, because all we've got leading this country is a real-estate grifter who's only talent is insulting people.

I hope there's at least one adult left in our administration to make a phone call to BYD - the Chinese company that just announced completion of the world’s largest mass-produced face-mask plant now running at full capacity, producing 5 million masks and 300,000 bottles of disinfectant per day.

It could even be just call to Warren Buffet's office in Omaha Nebraska, because he owns a big piece of BYD - and could probably get things done there for us."

Swine clue, SARS, H1N1 and now Coronavirus originated in China. The world needs to hold them accountable for these outbreaks.

2020-03-19 02:43:22,"This article claims that the Chinese government is filling a global leadership gap, but this is highly debatable. Unsurprisingly, the CCP is making inroads in small countries like Serbia with communist histories and sympathies, but there is much more reserve towards the Chinese government in other countries and blocs, including the EU. Ursula Van der Leyen tweeted that Europe had sent supplies to China when China requested aid for the epidemic and China is now returning the favor. Her words and actions give absolutely no sense that the EU as a whole and most of its larger economies are allowing the Chinese government to take any sort of leadership position in its borders. I'm sure the Chinese government is seeking that kind of leadership role, but it's very doubtful it will succeed. In fact, politicians like Giorgia Meloni in Italy have been fulminating against the Chinese government for its negligence and deception in dealing with and communicating about Covid-19. Her opinion is shared by others in Europe, and by some Americans. A reporter asked the candidates in the Biden-Sanders debate how they planned to hold the Chinese government accountable for Covid-19. I believe the sense of frustration with and distrust of the Chinese government is widespread globally and within China's own borders. Any global ""leadership gap"" will be filled by multilateral partnerships not unilateral Chinese control. Thankfully."

So it quotes a Chinese who is a regular critic:

“China is now trying to repair its severely damaged international image due to its mishandling of the outbreak in Wuhan in early January,” Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, wrote in an email.""

What is the basis the second guessing of motives?

I'll be fair and don't hesitate to say China started out shakily and made missteps -- mishandling per Pei -- but please, let's be balanced In our assessment. It was quite an achievement to mobilise resources to manage containment of the virus in a population of 1.5 billion. And they seem to have overcome the epidemic.

Here in Canada, with only 40,000,000, we are catching our tails to contain the spread. Imagine a country with 1,500,000,000. Wuhan alone has 11 million.

Come on!"

They punished their own doctor in Wuhan for trying to warn the people. He died and is now recognized all over the world as a hero.

The 50cent people posting all the wonderful words about their brutal military junta is an example of their twisted propaganda, and it is sad.

Still, hundreds of millions of Chinese people are trying to get out--many of who dream of being American citizens.

But keep in mind, this is a new virus, they probably didn't know what hit them at the beginning. Comparing to what's happened here, even weeks after China took unprecedented action to lockdown the entire country, Trump still downplayed the threat of the epidemic. Since its decisive (or draconian) measures, China has largely limited the disease to Hubei province within China, and passed legislation to ban wild animal trade, which is thought to be the origin of the virus. But what about the rest of the world? As a NYT column stated a few days ago, China bought the West time, but the West just wasted it.

The Chinese government allowed the wet markets where corona originated to continue even though SARS gave them ample warning that those markets were a danger to the world. And then the Chinese government hid the corona epidemic for too long when it could have been contained. And finally, the Chinese government now positions itself as a hero for having contained the virus, rather than taking responsibility for its role in getting to where we are now. It's great if the Chinese government helps other countries deal with the corona virus; given their role in allowing this pandemic to emerge, they should! Any article on the Chinese government's aid to others should be balanced by presenting the facts regarding why we are where we are now. I support any effort to bring attention to the duplicitous Chinese government's role in the generation and spread of corona."

International leaders,  media commentators and some readers here who praise the Chinese actions, comparing the Chinese government actions  favorably to ours, are either terribly misguided or acting as surrogates of Chinese propaganda to serve their economic interests."
2020-03-19 05:33:10,"There’s a lot of disagreement on whether the numbers being reported by China is accurate or trustworthy. As in many other areas, the most logical way of trying to figure out if someone is being truthful is determining whether he is incentivized to lie. By this metric, China was dishonest at the earlier stage when they tried to cover up the discovery of the virus hoping it would go away. The “incentive” then was that the provincial officials wouldn’t have to deal with their bosses if it went away. Things have come a long way since then. No doubt the incentives are still skewed toward pleasing their bosses, but the outcomes are more likely towards testing metrics than keeping numbers down."

Frankly I feel sick and tired on emotional and political sentiments from misunderstandings on both sides. (I am also a bit surprised that I did not find any article of NYT on impact of virus situation to a normal person's life and feeling or an ordinary medical staff's assessment of situation in China to give reader a feel about the real situation. All news focus on political issues.) It doesn't help anybody in fighting on who is wrong or who has an ambition to be the god of world under current situation (think of it, almost like child play).

Take the same sample to Peru, Bolivia, Centroamerica, etc...It really bothers me to watch a diminished US leadership in the time of crisis and when humanitarian aid is so much needed. How come the US didn't implement a massive testing weeks ago? It is so difficult to fight against an invisible enemy and testing would have give us the advantage of triaging and knowing exactly how to fight this disease accurately and effectively. Look us now, in complete crisis and chaos, when other nations are already moving ahead beyond the tip of the problem as Singapore, S.Korea and China.

China lied in the beginning and is still lying now. Even WHO has stopped mimicking China's claim of no new cases. The credibility of WHO was already questioned and this pandemic sealed its fate. No one takes WHO seriously.

The only question I have is why the media continues to publish China's statements with little or zero pushback. I doubt proclamations from Russia or many other countries would be taken without scrutiny. Until China is open and backs up their statements they should not be published as facts.

Unfortunately Italy long ceded its country to Chinese control and must puppet the propaganda out of desperation. Italy was warned by other European countries to not make certain deals with China so they have some nerve criticizing other European nations for their predicament.

Just as China has some juxtpa claiming it is a saviour after creating this death march. China can initiate all the propaganda they want along with questionable media outlets and corrupt politicians. Yet the people have not forgotten who started this and any politician or media outlet that pushes another agenda will surely feel the wrath of the people as more die."

And now they still control the manufacture of most of our medications(or materials used in their manufacture), a good proportion of masks and other PPE's, and so many other important products. This is a really urgent situation. Our political leaders need to ensure that we are never ever again beholden to this Communist country and its heartless leaders.

Nothing would cut the transmission of Corona virus like wearing a mask, goggles snd gloves.

I wish the governor and mayor would  stop whining and start doing things themselves, and getting factories up and running to make masks would be one thing. Telling all New Yorkers to wear Masks, goggles and gloves when shopping would be another.

It’s a cultural thing, we feel awkward about wearing masks , well let’s get over that. And yes masks aren’t totally effective, and you have to know how to take them off, but they would help in so many ways.

But other countries around the world have been incubators for other epidemics also. In an increasingly globalised world, we have to work together to solve problems.

To China's credit, it did take action. Nonetheless, the situation with Japan, Korea, Taiwan!, and Singapore ALL show that perhaps its model isn't as good as that of a democracy - in some of these other countries, the population density is greater. Yet they have flattened the curve. So you can't convince me that authoritarian rule is the only way to curb handle something like this. What we need is good government  (which even China didn't have when it first tried to play down the threat until it did - who knows how many lives could've been saved because of this?)."

In recent weeks state media have touted China’s support for other countries facing the outbreak. A recent graphic published by the People’s Daily showing the number of new infections around the world had surpassed those within China included a gleeful headline hailing the “reverse” in fortunes.
But Beijing’s aid is no altruistic act. It aims to promote a feel-good narrative at home and boost softpower abroad. 
The Communist Party shifts attention away from its early failures to tackle the virus - its spread posed one of the most serious threats to the leadership in decades.
Italy, the second worst afftected country after China welcomes aid from Beijing. But Xi Jinping politicises it, highlighting the struggles European countries have had in helping each other, and drawing a favourable contrast between himself and Trump, who instead imposed a travel ban from Europe. 
In a phone call with Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, this week, Xi said he hoped to establish a “health silk road” as part of China’s global One belt, One Road initiative, which has come under criticism from countries wary of Chinese ambition to expand leverage and influence. 
Foreign minister Luigi Di Maio posted a video of himself on Facebook watching live footage of a plane of supplies and medics from China, noting that China was the first to send aid to Italy."
2020-03-19 12:03:45,"China owes the world this aid, after allowing wild animal markets to continue thriving even though experts knew they are breeding grounds for new viruses.  The world needs to clamp down on these markets, or this will happen again and again.  Never mind climate change, humanity will be destroyed by virus long before that (how many more economic shocks can we withstand in the 21st century??)."
2020-03-19 12:37:29,"Helping other nations is the right thing to do.   And since we live in a capitalist economy-- one China is quite adept at, we should be grateful China is ramping up production, though it's unclear whether the US will benefit from any of this, considering the US offered no aid to China when it was in peril.

Yes, the Chinese  live animal market was likely the source of this problem.  But their culture is also a lot more selfless than ours, as are most asian countries.  This ability to think about the welfare of others is critical in fighting this virus. 

Our selfishness is now our biggest risk factor.  As is our president who is the outgrowth of that greed."

The proof of that so far  what happens in US and  Western Europe."

China acted quickly and well, and the results are now obvious. It is a double standard to laud any western country if they give assistance to others. However, if a non-Western country shows compassion, then it is deemed a ""diplomatic offensive"". Really?"
2020-03-19 14:30:14,China followed the same secretive behaviors with the 2003 SARS outbreak. By not notifying the World Health Organization timely they  consciously unleashed this virus globally. Should they be stigmatized? Shame is an important motive of selfish human behavior.

2020-03-20 11:51:08,"Here's my experience with corona virus testing:

I am a retired infectious disease specialist and university faculty member.  I volunteer in a free clinic, and last week a saw several patients, none of whom were ill.  However, on Monday I began experiencing cold symptoms.  Although I wasn't seriously ill, I most likely caught the infection at the clinic.  If it was COVID-19, it would be community transmission from an asymptomatic person, which I thought would be of significant public health interest.   After several phone calls to the university and local health department, it was apparent that I wasn't likely to be tested any time soon.   It seems they're only testing people with known exposures or more severe illness.  Thus they're probably missing lots of mild cases.    

I just stayed home, and I'm feeling much better."
2020-03-20 11:51:58,"Everlywell, a company that offers DIY at home medical tsting yesterday anounced the will have test kits avialble for sale as of Monday, 3/23.

Initially 10,000 will be avialble. They hope to add sufficient capacity to process up to 250,000 tests a week.

Test cost is $135.  

If they can do it (assuming this is a reputable company and their science is sound) and these tests become available to the general public, perhaps someone from the government should talk to them about purchasing the tests and distributing them where most needed.

Of course, the inability to test via public sector by definition keeps the numbers low."

Now it seems the vast majority resent scientific progress/facts because they might challenge one’s worldview, religion or opinion. Most are too proud to ever admit being wrong and too lazy to engage in the hard work of understanding the nuances of difficult issues and policies. These characteristics are undeniably exemplified by our current leadership.

OK to listen to doctors who trump has brought in like Dr. Fauci or Birks.  They speak accurately.  But trump lives in his own reality designed solely to further his own interests.  Trump remains focused upon trump, not upon you, me and our families getting through this.  Some people listen when they hear from trump Corona-19 is not serious and will soon be gone, or that everybody who wants a test gets, or millions of masks now available.  Those who did listen to him got only extra disappointment which nobody needs now.  Seems OK to listen to the doctors other than the Surgeon General, but you will make this a much easier experience for yourself by simply turning off sound or changing channel when trump speaks.  This time much better spent washing your hands."
2020-03-20 11:43:23,"The facts of your story is one of the reasons it is difficult to get specific facts re this virus because testing is so erratic.

A story comes out that maybe seniors are at risk, then the. next day maybe young people are at risk, then the next day its the greatest scare since the Black Plague, then the next day it doesn't look that bad etc. etc.

Countries like Italy and Spain (and to a lesser extent the US) have a much greater death rate than the average flu but this can be because very few people are being tested, whereas deaths are final and easy to document. 

It could very well be determined after the fact that the number of people with the virus was tremendous making the death rate very low. 

Stats from S Korea and China are probably a little more accurate since many more people are being tested.

The bottom line is nobody will learn the truth until this virus has come and gone, but the ax grinders on both end of the aisle will push their theories.

As the old saying goes, figures don't lie, but liars figure."

I believe that representative sampling, as for flu, is essential for right assessment of disease spread geographically and along the time. Secondly, testing of non-severe cases will allow identifying those recovered (14 days after symptoms disappear) and able to keep countries working."

Just off the top of my head the above suggest that solutions come fast, results are best or problems solved if you address them as quickly as possible as well as always be prepared so you can.

Things which have been sorely lacking in either the policies, protocols or practicalities of the countries that have lagged in or been caught lacking in how they should have best responded to the Coronavirus from when they first became aware of it , let alone to when it had already presented itself and begun spreading throughout the countries it presented in.

There is no excuse for those nations who should have known better and have dropped the ball to the detriment of their people who are and will pay the much heavier price for these failures."

2020-03-20 12:01:43,"One thing that I don't get. Why is it that the US decided not to buy the tests that were widely available? WHO were selling tests to countries in Feb. This allows for countries to get tests in a very prompt and quick manner. Yet the US decided not to do so and to develop their own tests. And to make things better, the tests they developed are faulty. Why reinvent the wheel when there is no need to?

2020-03-20 12:09:01,"I live in a country just north of the 49th parallel, with universal health care.  Which means we focus on prevention more than the cure.  We do not profit when a patient shows up in hospital, we profit when we prevent the need to do so.
We therefore have very active systems of public health acting in a coordinated fashion across the country.
In my province, with a population of 4.7 mill, we have done close to 17,000 tests, with 122 positive results.  This gives us a clear understanding of exactly where we are in community spread and when to implement the drastic measure to slow this tsunami down.  I hope we haven’t miscalculated, but at least we had the numbers to calculate.  
I have watched with sickened dismay how the lack of coordination and available testing has created the perfect storm in our beloved neighbour to the south.  I pray that my fears are unfounded and you all pull through this with minimal destruction.  Early reports, are not so optimistic.
With discipline and effort, good can be born of tragedy and hopefully the health care system stateside can be revamped to prevent future disasters."

2020-03-20 12:18:25,"I think you've overstated how widespread testing is in Australia. The criteria for testing are very strict: you must have been in an affected country, and you must have been in contact with someone who has the virus, and you must have symptoms. Many people with symptoms are turned away, and estimates by Norman Swan, a respected doctor on the national broadcaster the ABC, are that there 20 times as many people with the virus as have been tested. Many of us feel testing should be as aggressive and widespread as it has been in South Korea, Taiwan or Singapore."

Have had persistent cough, congestion, and headache since returning but was denied testing. My 14 day self-quarantine ends tomorrow, still coughing. When the postmortem of this crisis is performed, I hope they identify who within HHS/CDC rejected the WHO test, and who stood to profit from the test to be developed by  CDC. As a few other commenters have said, follow the money. Perhaps I would be less skeptical if the head of HHS was not a former Pharma lobbyist, or if some of those who had the President's ear in the early stages of the crisis - I'm looking at you Jared - were even remotely qualified to provide counsel."
2020-03-20 12:39:32,"We were too late to test and isolate infected individuals, and now SARS-CoV-2 is spreading unchecked. So now what? CA was the first stare to bravely declare a shelter in place order, and many have been practicing social distancing for weeks. So why are people so desperate to get tested?? Patients are filling hospital ERs, among them the ‘worried well’ or ‘hysterical healthy’, and endangering themselves and others in the process! Testing is only useful when it is either for research purposes (for example to define the true extent of transmission or death rate / but too late for that in US so look to South Korea for those figures) or when it is ACTIONABLE - meaning, a result will change behaviors or direct appropriate treatment. Our mandate is clear: reduce exposure by staying home - and that action wouldn’t change regardless of a test result. Similarly, there is no treatment for mild-moderate disease, and mass testing now ironically puts individuals who may test negative at risk of contracting the disease. So why are some still obsessed with being tested?"
2020-03-20 12:44:50,"In the UK we probably made the same mistakes as the USA. Initially there was the idea of Herd Immunity where most of the population would get it and thus develop immunity. Only last Monday, there was a report from Imperial College which said that if we carried on down this road there would be 250k deaths in the UK and 1.3m deaths in the USA. Those deaths would be mostly of those older than 70 and those with other conditions.
So Johnson changed tack. The best hope now is self isolation for the vulnerable  in the hope that in 3 months or so we would be in warmer weather, the NHS would be better equipped etc. 
There is some evidence that Johnson is backtracking from this. He won't close bars and restaurants etc. Presumably for financial reasons, so in London some of these are full thus spreading it around nicely.  
I fear that the USA will be badly affected. Unless you can lock down cities properly,"
2020-03-20 12:46:45,"We learned in 2008 that trickle-down economics doesn't work when our government pumped money into the economy to supposedly help large corporations and their employees.  These corporations promptly allowed wages for nearly all workers except top executives to remain flat or decline, while repurchasing stock to care for investors.

We are going to learn now that gutting the federal government in order to maintain tax relief for large corporations and the wealthy is not only immoral, but downright deadly.  

The republican platform touts this fictional story of economic prosperity by stripping government of its power, and empowering the rugged individual.  It sounds nice in theory but doesn't work in reality."

I know Australia has 1/10 the population of the US, but still, this disparity is shocking. Our only hope is that next time, the US will be prepared. Regardless, we're told that the virus will disappear in April anyway..."
2020-03-20 12:54:21,"I’m a doctor in Singapore. Testing is not widespread or easy. You absolutely can’t just go to a local clinic or hospital and get tested. The real help is the system.

2020-03-20 12:56:01,"It is not surprising to me that the Trump Administration has failed the US public so badly in this public health crisis. The President has created an anti-science environment based on fear, requiring all staff to contort their actions and words to conform to his messaging, which itself seems to come from Fox commentators like Hannity. 

The messaging from the White House and GOP only started to shift when the stock market started to tank, reflecting the potential financial damage to the GOP donor class.   

Even now, the President is bizzarely demanding that state employment agencies hide their data on new unemployment claims from the public. 

We are inching closer to the authoritarian style which has served the common person in corrupt regimes across the world. 

Hopefully, we will be able to vote this year to choose the national leadership style we need going forward."
2020-03-20 12:56:02,"If you want to know what the real number WAS 3 weeks ago, you simply have to multiply the number of deaths times 100. In the case of the USA 217 x 100 = 21700 cases - THREE weeks ago. Why 3 weeks ago? Because those who die, die several weeks into being infected. That means, the real number in the USA has to be modelled 21 days into the future from that day with 21700 infections 3 weeks ago with an exponential growth factor.
Numbers taken from www.worldometer.info/coronavirus/ which I suggest to check at 9pm in the evening, since numbers are still accumulating during the day."

2020-03-20 12:27:00,"So the Asian nations pushed ahead immediately while the Western nations sat on their hands and let the disease get out of control.  This is a reflection of the cultural differences between the East and West.

In the East, nature is neither good nor evil.  Humans beings do not conquer nature, they are a part of it.  They flow with it.

In the West, nature is an instrument of good or evil.  Natural disasters are acts of God.  Our literature calls them out as divine punishment for wrongdoing.  As such, humankind must conquer nature, not flow with it.  This causes Western cultures to believe that they can overcome nature, to dominate it.  Nature has been politicized.  This politicization has caused the West to believe we can control and dominate nature.  We think we are invulnerable.  We are not.

That virus will rip us apart.  We are vulnerable to the most primitive life form on the planet.  Our sense of invulnerability causes us to not do what is necessary.  Our politics and worship of immediate profit causes us not to realize the dangers posed by invisible microbes.

The virus is winning and many still do not accept what is happening now, and especially, what is going to happen in the coming months.  Delusions of invulnerability will do that."

2020-03-20 12:24:21,"Testing or not, one has to understand that as long as out health care systems can cope, we can assume a mortality rate of ~1%. That said, we need to look at the numbers of death, multiply them times 100 to get an idea of the infection numbers from 2-3 weeks ago, since people die several weeks into getting seriously sick. With other words, our infection numbers are not accurate and we need to closely monitor newly infected patients to determine the ultimate mortality rate. Again, this rate can then only be assumed, as long as our hospitals can cope and the mortality rate goes up dramatically, when we cannot cope with the numbers that need ICU support. That is what we see in Italy and also parts of Spain already. In Italy the mortality rate currently stands at 3.9% - precisely because of that. Whoever does not take this serious, let me remind you, in the 2017/18 flu season 80,000 Americans died when the death rate was between 0.1-0.2%. With this new Coronavirus, the death rate is at least 0.5-1.0% - that means 5-10 times higher. What does that mean? It means that in case the USA has a level of infections as during the 2017/18 flu season, deaths could be as high as 800,000. And only, IF we can cope with the numbers needing ICU support. Otherwise this could increase by a factor of 3, 4 or even 5 .... that simple. By the way, I am writing this from Spain and we are under lockdown. Amazing how quick people understand when friends and neighbours die."
2020-03-20 11:55:39,"The biggest question I have is - why in the world did the US decide not to buy the test kits from WHO? WHO had test kits available and was selling to countries in Feb. Yet, the US refuse to buy from overseas and insists on developing themselves (which takes time). And to make things even better, the tests were faulty. 😂😂 Is it Pride? Reminds me of Proverbs 16:18 ""Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall""."
2020-03-20 12:14:21,"What’s missing in this discussion is the evidently disastrous advice for people in places other than East Asia, where this is an instinctive habit, not to wear masks unless they’re showing symptoms. All you needed to do a few days ago was to go on the BBC website and get this kind of terrible advice from a physician projecting calm and professional authority. 

Well, it turns out that asymptomatic people have been the most active disease vectors – the very people who needed to be wearing masks when they were outside when we first found out about this pandemic. Even if standard surgical masks don’t work as well as N95 respirators, they are nonetheless well known to be effective in preventing carriers from spreading viruses if they’re wearing them properly. Medical experts who understand the problem of asymptomatic transmission should have known this from the beginning and stopped people from spreading this destruct nonsense. 

We are going to look back on this as one of the key informational disasters of this period. Conspiracy theorists and anti-government bunker-dwellers will ultimately likely also use it as a reason not to trust “experts.” Well done.

This whole episode is also likely be seen as a lost opportunity to learn from places like Japan and Hong Kong, where the spread of the virus has been largely controlled by the mass adoption mask wearing as a daily habit, along with practice of social distancing (bowing instead of kissing) and proper hand hygiene."
2020-03-20 12:22:15,"Careful before you belittle our doctors and scientists over China and other counties.

Do you know why our researchers are going slow on testing? Do you know why other countries were so quick to release their test kits?

We do not enough about this virus. Releasing an inaccurate or an incomplete kit not only gives a false sense of complacency but also could undermine the health of all."
2020-03-20 12:36:02,This should not be a surprise to anyone.  Human nature has a difficult time understanding warning signs and therefore preparing themselves.  Obviously some are better at it than others.  It is no different with countries and governments.  Having an ego maniac as a leader and a Congress owned by corporations lost their ability to focus on their real purpose of protecting and working for the people they are supposed to represent.  The love of money and power has brought us again to this point.  America is all show and very little substance.  It wasn't always this way.  Leadership cannot be bought.  This pandemic will pass but there will be another.  We are facing climate disasters in our future.  Will we be prepared for them.  Will we recognize the hazards of our destiny once this over or will we blunder on thinking everything is going to be just like it was?  Do we look for answers in prayer or do we recognize the answers science provides us?  Humanity is really at a precipice right now and it's not just because of the pandemic.
2020-03-20 13:01:33,"This can't be emphasized enough.  The testing process has been portrayed as 'very complex', but it relies on relatively routine techniques.  Additionally, it would be good to hear more about a suggestion from some quarters that we initiate 'surveillance' testing to get a better handle on population prevalence, which doesn't need to be as rigorous and controlled as a diagnostic test aimed at providing very high reliability information to an individual patient. Surveillance testing could potentially be much higher throughput and the population level information might help focus resources during what is looking to become an incredibly stressful time for our hospital and health system. Presumably a positive in a surveillance test could be followed up with a more rigorous diagnostic test.  Potentially could also help focus use of the diagnostic kits to verifying infections in positives from surveillance testing.  None of this is ideal, obviously, but we're looking to go from terrible to minimally acceptable rather than perfect at this point if we hope to slow this thing down and mitigate the damage."
2020-03-20 13:02:08,"Dr Brix mentioned that the US test was delayed because initial versions were not sufficiently accurate and would have resulted in an inordinate number of false positives causing many people to believe they had the virus when they didn’t.  This makes sense generally but not in this specific case where it was imperative to isolate those with the virus early.  Sequestering people with false positives may cause additional inconvenience, anxiety and resource consumption but it will not add to the spread of the disease.  It seems to me that the CDC came at the problem from the wrong direction.  They should have been more concerned about minimizing the false negatives since these people would falsely believe they didn’t carry the virus and would not be likely to change their habits unless their symptoms were very pronounced. But even a test with a relatively high false negative ratio is still better than no test at all.  So in hindsight the CDC should have released the early version of the test and replaced it as better tests came along."

2020-03-20 13:07:55,"I have one patient that was sick enough to be tested (found to be positive) and 3 or 4 that probably have COVID as well and won't get tested because I don't have access to tests. They are all recuperating at more or less the same pace and within a few days will be able to leave their homes again. 

As a physician, I typically order any test because it's going to lead to a change in treatment or management. In the absence of a treatment, and with the limits of testing here in NYC where there's wide community spread it's reasonable to presume covid when someone has mild symptoms and calls their health care provider.

Testing now is probably more an academic (and maybe futile?) exercise than a genuine preventive public health intervention. We will never know the full incidence of the illness in a statistically sound fashion and our leaders dropped the ball...bigly."
2020-03-20 13:09:39,I fail to see the significance of a test when their is no medicine to help the symptoms and we should stay home and avoid contact.  Seems more like a science project.
2020-03-20 13:27:43,"This is absolutely incomprehensible.  RNA extraction is the most routine of biochemical procedures.  Molecular biology labs buy kits for this in bulk, boxes of 250 or 500 kits for $3-4 per kit.  Same thing for reverse transcription to DNA and then PCR amplification with virus-specific primers, and in principle, that's all you need.  You can get the primers made and delivered overnight, cheaply and in nearly unlimited quantity.  Any graduate student could design a test and execute it in a matter of hours.  I've read several articles like this and I still can't understand what the holdup is."
2020-03-20 13:28:09,"Contrary to opinion here, tests are not something you buy off the shelf and take home and use.  The CDC and FDA tightly control all testing.  The delays we are experiencing are the result of their regulations using our OWN approved test.

The FDA approval process, alone, for an outside test would have taken weeks. Imagine the amount of re-work involved in introducing an outside test downstream when every step of the testing process is tightly controlled by the FDA"
2020-03-20 13:32:59,"I’ve had a 38.5-39 fever for 5 days, sore throat, tight chest . I called the 811 number in Canada three days ago and a nurse called me this morning for screening. I have been passed to the next level of screening and will get a call in 24 hours to test or not. I’m self-isolating and won’t change my behaviour if I test positive. For me I worry about what if things go badly, quickly and I am unable to leave my house. I live alone, I have friends here, but none close (I work abroad and am not home much). My family is a minimum 1,000 km away... i know I’m made to feel guilty for wanting/getting a test, but in China (where I work and left Jan 15) testing is available and done on anyone with a fever... isn’t more data better? Isn’t doing general tracing better than not? I just want to know and want others to know incase I get worse."
2020-03-20 13:36:12,"It is not easy to get tested in Australia.  Anecdotally, a friend in Sydney who has strong symptoms has been refused a test as she can't say who she may have caught it off.

2020-03-20 13:46:49,Shouldn’t everyone just assume they have it and do all they can to not spread it further? We’re most contagious prior to experiencing symptoms so it makes sense and would be good public health policy to just assume we are carrying the virus and act accordingly.
2020-03-20 13:49:45,"While Australia has done a good job of preparation, they are now running short of reagents and the wait times for getting test results are getter longer.  Still, that's better than many other countries.

She called the 811 number locally in Halifax, Nova Scotia, spoke with a nurse and an appointment for testing was set up for 1 pm on the 20th. Here in Nova Scotia there is testing available, but after prescreening by telephone. There is no walk in testing and not everyone gets past the prescreeners. A friend of hers had possible exposure and developed symptoms at day 16. The prescreener said he was ineligible for testing. There is no magic about the 14 day cut off. A recent article in the Annals of Internal Medicine said that 1% of people will show symptoms after 14 days. Worldwide, testing criteria and procedures are inconsistent and I'm afraid that we'll realize what catastrophic mistakes were made only in retrospect."

But when leadership is failing us, ongoing failures and being dishonest about it and saying everyone can get tested, when we can't, what are we to do. Pretend?"
2020-03-20 14:00:04,"It is incorrect that Australia could get tested at will. Our inglorious PM limited testing to those who had recently flown in from overseas from Asia, people who had been verifiably in contact with a positive testee, and a few others like health staff. 

Even now, upon calling my local doctor recently due to a cold (I think - it was very mild) I was told to follow that advice. 

So for the record, I’m case anyone gets that wrong impression, we might have the tests but we do not get tested at will."
2020-03-20 14:03:02,"""... political leaders are rushing to make testing more widely available""

With all the money we spend, we should have the best politicians that money can buy, but apparently we don't. Australia spends less on politicians but seems to be getting more for their money.

Perhaps we should let doctors, scientists and health care managers run the test development and distribution and leave the politicians out of it.

Oh well, too late for that."
2020-03-20 14:05:42,"Our government spends 3/4s of a trillion dollars on the military every year. Maybe we should have spent a fraction of this amount on pandemic preparedness. 

For example, there are a few million health care workers in this country. If we had prepared 100 PPE's for each one, at ten bucks each and replaced them every ten years, it would have cost 2 billion dollars every ten years, or 200 million per year. Far less than 1/1000th of the annual military budget.

How about the ability to rush the manufacture of testing kits?  Another billion per year just to be ready to make kits--the way Iceland was able to make them?

Maybe be ready with tent-style military hospitals with 500 beds each?  My guess is that if this country needed a hundred of those at immediate notice, the government could manufacture twenty per year at ten million (?) each. 

Ventilators and gas masks?  Pay a few large manufacturers  an annual fee to be ready just in case. Stress test them like we stress test the banks for their ability to overcome worthless debt during economic downturns.

We have lobbyists from every military manufacturer making sure as much business as possible is pushed toward their employers. I'd bet there's a Senator from some state right now attaching a rider to a bill ensuring that the tank plant in his state builds an extra 500 tanks next year-- tanks the military doesn't need. 

The military industrial complex is well represented. Who represents the people for pandemic preparedness?"
2020-03-20 14:13:00,"See Italian News la Repubblica of yesterday

A private company in Italy has shipped 500,000 kit tests to the US this week, that flew form the military base in nothern italy back to the US on a military plane.
The same company, Copan Diagnostics, indicates that the issue is not test kits availability, the production is more than sufficient, but the availability of labs to have them is the bottleneck."
2020-03-20 14:21:07,"Well, now we know where is the real ""Third World"". Western democracies apparently have nothing of value to offer other countries in the context of effective governance. 

Perhaps it is all a function of the excessive value placed on ""individual"" freedoms and excessive self-regard. Perhaps real freedom can be found only in collective responsibility and a willingness to see this value as the basis for electing ""our"" representatives. 

In each and every major Western European and North American country there has been decision paralysis at the highest levels of government as well as a refusal to invest in preventive measures - except for unneeded military equipment. 

Let's face it: our leaders were more afraid of possible minor ""economic"" effects, especially on inflated share prices, than on the health and safety of the people they were supposed to protect and defend. Before we cast stones - or ballots - we might be well advised to look at our mirrors."
2020-03-20 14:21:24,"Despite the technical and political setbacks in developing our own national testing kits, our ability to test for COVID-19 has been greatly assisted by the generous donation of half a million test kits by the Jack Ma Foundation. We are indeed a global community and it is heartening to see expressions of that reality despite our current leadership's preference for a more narrow, nationalistic approach"
2020-03-20 14:25:22,"Maybe I'm missing something but the whole discussion about testing seems to assume there is some great advantage in it for individual patients. Testing is important in helping authorities track and isolate the disease, but because there is no cure, the individual is just as sick (or not) whether they are tested or not. The controversy over sports stars and celebrities cutting in line to be tested fails to mention this. Just because you've been swabbed doesn't mean you got some magical cure no one else has. It's a tool for health officials and governments but I don't see any specific benefit to the patient. Anyone with symptoms of any kind should be isolated, as should anyone who might have been exposed. If I'm wrong, someone please enlighten me."
2020-03-20 14:29:43,"If we look at France and UK, both countries that can still cope with the number if ICU patients, it has to be concluded that the infection rate is much higher than the official numbers.
France: 372 deaths suggest an infection number of 37200 3 weeks ago.
UK: 144 deaths -> 14400 infections - 3 weeks ago.

At an assumed mortality rate of 1% (as long as we can cope with the numbers of incoming patients) - and 3 weeks ago, because people that die, do die several weeks into it.

The death rate might be the best indicator of how many people WERE actually at least infected about 3 weeks ago. We need to project and model from that time ago 3 weeks into the presence to get an approximate idea of the current infection numbers. 

The reported numbers are definitely too low, also given testing is done at a relatively small scale and results can only correspond to tests performed. Once ICU capacities are overwhelmed, 1% mortality rate increases by a factor of 2, 3, 4 or even 5 .... and in the worst cases beyond that, where countries simply have no hospital beds to begin with, let alone ICU beds."
2020-03-20 14:30:14,Testing now is an important containment measure to help societies slow the spread of the disease and allow governments to try and keep up with medical necessity.  However people need to but may not understand that testing negative will be a big relief or a reason to relax their vigilance.  With the explosion of the pandemic you could be tested negative today and exposed tomorrow.
2020-03-20 14:44:14,"Testing is very important in Asian countries because most people listen to their government and will stay home for self-isolation. But this probably won't work out in the west. Italy is a good example. One of the reasons why so many people catch this virus is that they don't follow the orders from the government. Even they have lockdown their cities, but people still go outside meet friends without wearing any mask. Judging from how the American people around me reacts to this pandemic, I would guess eventually there will be more than 2 million people get infected in the USA. Even the death rate is 1%, that's 20,000 lives. Let's hope in the next two months our scientists can develop some medicine for fight against virus, since vaccine will take too long."
2020-03-20 13:26:22,"A lot of us were afraid when Trump was elected that he would do something to ruin the country. We were mostly thinking in terms of war, or attacks on our civil rights.
It turns out the reality is far, far worse.

President Obama couldn't have stopped the virus, but at least he would have had competent scientists and bureaucrats (the ""deep state"" Republicans so dread) dealing with it early on.

Instead, we have Trump dragging us down with his lies and insults (calling a governor a snake? Really??) the CDC being cut back; and a Republican congressman having a giggle wearing a gas mask on the floor of congress-- while one of his constituents lay dying, one of the first of what will be many, many victims of Covid19.

It should be obvious by now that the entire Republican attitude toward government-- that it has nothing to do if there isn't a war on-- is a disastrous folly. It is already to late to undo the damage Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have done so far. Our only hope is in November, to vote Blue, No Matter Who."
2020-03-20 13:57:54,"I do not accept the excuse that nobody is at fault. As your own article shows, nations such as Korea and Singapore took this threat seriously and were able to produce far higher volumes of test kits than America.  

Any time you see a physician with an ailment, tests are ordered. Our government has promised us again and again that tests would be available... yet virtually no-one is being tested.  

There seems to be a conspiracy to protect the individuals who are to blame, and I hope the Times gets to the bottom of this rather than blaming “the system.”"

If you're Donald Trump you think you can. During his  presidency, he's made it up as he goes along, he's refused  to get adequate information, he's shown a lack of respect for science - indeed, at times he's been hostile to it - and he's trusted hubris to get him through. What could go wrong?

This is the nightmare scenario we've all dreaded - a national crisis with The Donald at the helm. (Those of you that bet on terrorism, or war, or natural disaster (Exception: Those of you living in Puerto Rico can collect your winnings), or a virus of the cyber kind; sorry, you lost this round. But! hold on to your tickets; there's plenty of time in this administration. You still can be a winner!) An unprecedented pandemic in a country that is, basically, unpresidented.*

And speaking of fires, props to Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia. After his disastrous handling of the nation-wide fires, he has came back to handle the coronavirus response pretty well. It's nice to see a world leader who can learn from his mistakes.

I dont see anyone identifying how many were tested and NOT infected......we need perspective on what is actually taking place. Additionally,  if we think this is so wide spread...which seems to be the case in certain areas.... we should take location data from mobile carriers on those deemed infected, and notify all those in a range based on movement of infected an individual to self quarantine vs shutting down cities, states and the whole country. We have the technology to better mitigate this while vaccines and viral treatments are worked on."

For America, the misinformation spewed forth by our own president resulted in the lack of containment, planning and preparation and even caused a run on toilet paper. 

There continues to be no plan of attack even though it is ""war-like"" and the only preparation we are feeling is the mental aspect of the ""worst is yet to come.""

Trump may lose, in fact it is likely, but the senate will remain republican and most democrats will remain ""centrist"" with their allegiance to corporations as well, so the status quo will be maintained.

Isn’t that their job?  Why did they get the first test wrong?   Why weren’t they prepared for the volume testing to use as data gathering?  This stuff seems fundamental to their role.

It was completely baffling when CDC decided that we should test only people who 1) were deathly ill or 2) were a) symptomatic and b) also had a history of contact with someone who was likely infected and c) tested negative for other respiratory diseases.   This was a concerted effort to keep the number of detected infections low.   Everyone knew that this was only looking at a fraction of the infections.

At that point, the government of the country with the best doctors, best hospitals, best private companies, etc., etc., etc., should’ve taken actions that responsible adults and parents would take to protect our loved ones. 

But our President did not do that.  He did not take a measure of the time factors involved.  He did not form a task force.  He did not assign a pandemic czar.  He did not order testing.  He did not prepare his constituents.  He did not do any of the things that responsible leaders have now taken, except when he was forced to do so, and it was too late.  By comparison, he just looks feckless. 

This failure of leadership is on him.  But how could we allow him to do this to us?  

Note well:  he is doing the same thing to us with regard to climate change impacts.  It’s just slower and longer term....and much more costly and deadly.

Finally, has anyone tested zinc spray such as Zicam? It is especially useful on the colds that start in the throat, like COVID-19.

Since I started using it on common colds, not a single one has got down to my chest. That's been the case for about 4 years and 8 or more colds.

As the this article says, once the contagion is too great, testing will be impractical, but right now, consider—out of a population of 11.7 million in Ohio, about 200 people have tested positive for the virus, yet schools and restaurants are closed, all public gatherings like concerts are cancelled, people are working from home and who knows how long before there is a “stay home” order. So the economy of Ohio has ground to a halt because of around 200 infected people. I am aware that due to limited testing, the actual number is unknown, but even if it were 1,000–to shut down an economy because .0001 percent of the population is sick makes no sense. And if widespread testing had been available, or could be made available now, quickly, this would not be necessary. This is how other countries flattened the curve and we still have time to do this in much of the country. When you look at the upcoming deep recession, you can blame our administration for letting the spread of this disease get out of control and letting our economy fall apart."

I remember HHS Secretary Margaret Heckler assuring us that a vaccine would be coming soon, despite the fact that was obvious at the time; that HIV is a retro-virus and a vaccine had never been conceived of for a virus that attacks the immune system itself.  The prospects for a vaccine for HIV are only on the horizon now, decades later, and effective treatments to hold HIV at bay took years to develop.

While it is much more easily and universally transmissible than HIV,  Covid-19 is fortunately a virus with a biological structure that is less challenging than retro-virus HIV.   We also benefit from all the research and testing over the intervening years of sophisticated anti-viral medications spurred by the search for treatments of HIV, that may help us find treatments that will have some effectiveness in lowering the mortality rate for Covid-19.   

We also have the benefit of Anthony Fauci who has been at the NIH since the early days of HIV, and who perseveres against hype, fear and obstinance, but bends when appropriate to find compassionate solutions."
2020-03-20 14:07:08,"The USA has some of the best labs, universities and research centers anywhere. People across the world compete and leave loved ones behind for the chance to study here. So what happened?

The testing fiasco reveals what I see as our Achilles heel: our star spangled research institutions are ivory towers. Their research feeds into private pharmaceutical companies and patent folders, with very slow trickling or representation of our considerable brain trust outpourings into our system of governance. 

The dog-eat-dog, brutal academic competition for funding in the USA creates some of the most cutting edge results, but also exacerbates the lack of cooperation and the harvesting of research for the greater national good. 

A uniquely American, if not Anglo-European, problem."
2020-03-20 12:49:40,This is the direct result of our own President trying to downplay COVID-19 as media hype.  He was far more concerned with the stock market. For almost 2 months he could have ordered all of the country to prepare. He could have ramped up testing. He could have ramped up production of medical supplies. Yet he is still sitting on the Wartime Production Act when we need it most. This is important folks - our President’s refusal to take this seriously has already cost many lives. How does he sleep at night knowing that? The good news is that we are  le surely looking at a one term President. He’s finished now. History will not be kind to Donald J Trump who will forever be known as the COVID-19 President and an example of exactly what not to do in a pandemic.

Our  CDC, led by a pal of Pence turned out ineffective tests. Our current 'drive thru' testing programs puts the precious few health care workers at risk while having terribly long, slow lines, and are slowly cranking out results.

Since we're thinking outside the box anyway, why not provide the swabs and the tubes so that individuals can get their own samples (supervised by medics) and then turn them over to be sent to the lab. 
As it stands now this agonizing, relatively sloth like pace, will be months behind testing. Any data will be too late for those who have yet not contracted the virus to do enough help and Americans will be well on their way to the direst consequences.

There was a time when we'd have been leading the fight. Our tests would have been created first and sent around the world.  Our factories would have been busy in January churning out masks & parts for ventilators. Our president would have been issuing calm & reassuring press statements, not tweeting vile, racist garbage. I would have believed that, even if I might get sick & die, my country would prevail.

No.

No you don't get to make this better for the sake of a nice turn of phrase.

It was easy.  It was handed to Trump on a gold-plated platter.  It was explained.  It was demonstrated.  The staff were trained, the alerts sounded, the cautions re-enforced.

There was nothing hard about this.  Nothing at all difficult.  It was a no-brainier.

Enter Trump.

Knowing there was a plague on the horizon, knowing the planning would be costly, time consuming, and complex, knowing the lives of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of his citizens would be in play, he decided to shut the whole machine down.

And not just shut down, he drove a tank over the parts and scattered them to the wind.

Beyond the usual pro-Trump slant of your sub-head, you do highlight the real problem.

For Trump all this was easy.  So easy it required not one second thought .  ""There's no plague today.  The only guys talking about a plague are Obama guys.  I want to start as soon as possible handing no-strings billions to my rich buds and their corporations,  So...preparedness agencies CLOSED!""

Easy peasy, yes?

As you have been at extraordinary pains to point out, over and over again, no one believes Poor Trump could have avoided the plague.

America's deplorable state of unpreparedness to confront  COVID-19 is but the latest and most dreadful example of what happens in a vacuum of true leadership.  

Social conscience, competence, honesty, and empathy are NOT coming from the top, but from countless decent, strong and admirable American citizens doing what's necessary to deal with this pandemic.

Every single top-down decision by the Trump administration has been analyzed first and foremost as to whether it benefits politically and financially Trump himself, his family, and his party.  

For Trump in his crude Bizarro world, the growing devastation of coronavirus still remains overwhelmingly a political issue concerning his image, his reelection, and ability to keep making money.

But in spite of the weight of Trump and Trumpists sitting heavily on top of everybody else, the ingenuity, resilience, and goodness of the American people will come out on top.

These individual differences must be used to understand immunity. Why don't children become ill from COVID19? There is the problem of serology.

Emergency response calls for reasoned analysis of empirical evidence, not magical thinking and a magic marker.

Good government provides collective solutions to shared problems. It's what the Founders called caring for the welfare of the people. What we are experiencing is the deadly Republican dog eat dog, dog in the manger dystopia of capitalism run amok and an authoritarian kleptocrat running off the rails.

Recently a NYT commenter was saying  why care about testing, how is this different from the flu, just go to the hospital if you get really sick.  Just one reflection of either ignorance or nonchalance in the face of a pandemic. Or to justify Trump’s previous policy.

It is those who are asymptomatic who are most likely to unknowingly infect others. Other fatal diseases like Ebola disable and kill their hosts so that there is less chance of passing it on and it is easier to contain.

People with the flu can still go out without generally endangering others because most Americans are now vaccinated to help fight it. Not the coronavirus.

And if severe symptoms do appear, it is not recommended to rush directly to the hospital if you have Covid-19, because you will expose everyone else at the hospital if they are unprepared for you.  Call first so the proper precautions can be taken."

2020-03-20 11:45:10,"I see our testing problem as two-fold, and both are ultimately political not scientific.  

One is that we have a party that does not believe in government, and so has done everything it can to cut back, de-fund, shut down, deregulate, and minimize the effects of government programs designed to help the American people.  If we still had offices responsible for pandemic preparedness and management, we could have been where South Korea and other advanced countries are right now.  Sadly, this administration cut all of those programs.  

Second, we have a president who is in way over his head and is only concerned with how this disease affects his image.  Rather than rise to the occasion with true leadership, he has wanted to minimize the numbers.  Therefore he put no emphasize on getting tests or testing, or even getting the equipment needed to protect our healthcare workers.  

The country can literally die all around him and he and Pence will stand at that podium and insist that the president is doing a heck of a job, and blame the rest on the governors.  Trump is, after all, not a shipping clerk.

Meanwhile you're waiting in a room full of potentially infected people, so even if you test negative you could catch it then and assume your symptoms later on is the common cold. An old school friend's wife has been turned away twice, even though she is coughing blood, he visited tonight to get some toilet paper which I left on the porch for them - hidden from the street (as they were on their last roll and I have a lot spare since I got lucky and bought a bunch to give to family and friends, and some elderly friends of my mother). Still the testing regime may improve soon as a hundred thousand test have just arrived from overseas - but that leaves the question of why they were needed to be imported in the first place when Australia was one of the first to develop a test. Apparently Australia doesn't have the capacity to make many test, just to invent them.
So don't count Australia as one of the best practice yet, there hasn't been a proper sampling yet."
2020-03-20 16:14:28,"I have a relative who works for a hospital system that covers Seattle and Portland, among other places. She said her boss said the source of the problem is all the testing reagents from Europe were sent by the federal government to WalMart and Walgreens with the idea that a lot of people live near those businesses and can get tested. In the meantime, the hospitals dealing with sick people coming in have nothing. One of the batches from Europe was botched. Why aren’t our Dows and DuPonts spinning up the chemicals? Why aren’t our factories producing PPE? I know, short notice, but the response has been so badly bungled from the beginning. And it’s due to Trump wanting to profit and protect himself politically. Hospitals are asking regular folks to sew masks at home that meet CDC guidelines. Republicans missed an opportunity to impeach someone they knew and know is not up to the challenge. But look at the ones who got a classified briefing— profiting without regard for the sacrifices we the public are undergoing. Lock them up!"
2020-03-20 16:30:18,"""But patients who self-quarantine likely won’t ever be tested, making it difficult to know the true scope of the disease. And as the disease spreads, the practicality of testing declines, as does its value.""

I don't think the media fully understands the essence of testing.  Not only do tests have to be developed, but the reagents used in the tests need to be mass produced and themselves tested. This takes time. The CDC did not do this validation properly with their initial tests, so many had to recalled.  It's harder to do than the media makes it out to be.

Many Asian countries are being used as exemplars of how things should have been done.  This may well be appropriate.  But lets keep in mind that we have not verified the accuracy of all this testing.

Also, there's no doubt but that the US government should have had an infrastructure for mass producing tests, and this is indeed an epic and consequential failure.

Finally, note that there are two types of test: those that test for viral RNA; these detect active infections.  But there is a second type of test, developed, but not yet widely available, that detects  human antibodies to the virus.  Similar tests for other diseases such as mumps, measles, chickenpox, etc. have been widely available for many decades. 

Similar antibody tests for corona virus,  once available, will be able to tell who has had and recovered from covid-19.  In other words, the quote from this article at the top of this comment is likely incorrect."
2020-03-20 17:36:40,"Why have so many Italians, Italian Americans and Iranians who tested positive died and have a higher mortality rate of over 7%, compared to Americans (1.6%, Chinese 4%, Germans (0.18%) and South Koreans (1.1%)?

The possible explanation could be high dietary intake of carbohydrates (Rice, pasta, white bread, pizza, ice cream) and not enough protein intake (eggs, soyabeans, meat, fish, poultry, lentils, beans) by Italians and Persians. COVID-19 infections are mostly CURABLE unless there are some underlying conditions like acquired immunodeficiency due to other infections, diabetes, age above 60, or dietary imbalance or genetic immunodeficiency or extreme genetic immunodeficiency eg the bubble boy. 

The immune system is made of proteins like antibodies, cytokines and cells both require optimal protein intake without which it will mount a weaker immune response."
2020-03-20 12:02:48,"So let me get this right. Developing test kits is “relatively simple” but the CDC, our de-funded, supposed expert national organization dropped the ball? Why didn’t we use the WHO tests, follow the money. It’s always the clue to explain the mistakes made in this country.. 

I am at home with a fever, a cough and a wife who is also sick with similar symptoms. I travelled in US airports within the last two weeks. My local urgent care facility tested us both for the flu. negative. They refused a covid test because our symptoms are not severe enough. We are improving. We will never know if we had the virus or whether we could’ve infected others.

For those that don't like autotranslate, a brief summary:
- Tests were available very early and in large quantity in Germany.
- During last week, 100,000 tests were performed in the non-hospital sector (doctor's offices, drive-ins, ...). Total number of tests since beginning of crisis is unknown (due to the distributed, federal structures in Germany). Total capacity is 160,000 per week, still increasing capacity. Bottleneck is most of the 47  labs using semi-automated tests, and according to other reports not mentioned here, getting hold of your doctor or your local hotline.
- South Korea is currently testing 84,000 week. Per capita, that is 23/100,000 vs. 17/100,000 in Germany. Total number of tested as of this Friday is 316,664 (considering their first real outbreak started in late January, they also had to ramp up tests). A doctor's recommendation is also needed there.

My thoughts:
- The caption of the Spiegel article is a little misleading, basically both countries have the same testing philosophy, performance, and capacity.
- South Korea may have been so successful in limiting the spread because they were dealing with a localized outbreak at first.
- Germany had people everywhere coming back from vacation in Italy or Austria, which in my state accounts for more than half the numbers of this week."

2. Trump insists on calling COVID-19 ""Chinese virus,"" the fear of being discriminated and even harmed drove these people to Taiwan where there is healthcare for all system, enough testing and proper isolation/quarantine for the infected and possibly infected.

So the vast majority of the R have played the delay game for vital tests, goods, and medical equipment and supplies.

They called the Corona virus a hoax and a new Democratic attack on the President.

P.T. stated that he has known about the Corona pandemic for a long time. Also the R on the Senate intelligence knew the scope and the Reproduction  factor early on.

What did they do with this knowledge? Sold their stock, lied to the American people about the potential severity of the outbreak, and did NOTHING to minimize the spread of the virus and obtain the equipment and supplies to medically treat those with CoVid-19.

The scientists and officials who worked diligently, prudently,and knowledgeably to name the virus and the illness sought a descriptive name that was not prejudicial/harmful to any national group, race, or creed.

So P.T. and Rs decided to call it the Wuhan or Chinese virus. Well, it is true that in the past the naming did use regional or personal designations, this is no longer considered appropriate or desirable.

In homage to their xenophobia, they avoided the official nomenclature. Their anti-science and anti-government approach is in ascendance.

we have to set aside politicians entirely. politicians are only a partisan slime that spreads over the top of government, in much the same way the crud spreads inside your gym sneakers.

the issue is how our governmental agencies are structured to identify, coordinate, and respond. the government (here, at least) is not a leviathan but a hydra headed grotesque.

much of the USA failure to respond early, develop tests early, coordinate resources, has been due to gaps, cracks and turf wars between the different agencies. 

if we learn from this, and set up our government to respond automatically, effectively and with full force, then it doesn't matter what kind of fungus happens to be in the corridors of power. 

the people we malign as ""bureaucrats"" will do what they do, do it promptly and efficiently, and let the politicians take all the credit.

2020-03-20 16:30:34,"This administration is a disaster, but the lack of testing is due to 1) the global supply chain 2) bad decisions 3) the type of tests we chose to do.  

China decided to use the antigen based tests, results are ready in less than an hour but it has a tendency to give false negatives.  So that’s a under-reporting issue.  

We, and a bunch of Western countries, decided on a PCR approach which takes at least a day to get results, but it doesn’t have a false negative problem.  It does tend towards false positives if you use contaminated reagents.  Plus, it requires more steps so there’s more that can go wrong.  And it did go wrong.  We picked the wrong primers, they looked good on paper but not in practice.  We fixed that.  And then one of the steps requires a primer kit from Germany.  The German company said they sent us two years worth but where are they?  Lost in the mail?  

Some people blame our centralized approach because we relied on just the one type of primer kit from Germany.  We weren’t letting labs create different types of tests.  A capitalist society is good at a decentralized approach.  That’s all true, but why are we ignoring our global supply chain problem?  

France has Dior creating disinfectants instead of perfumes.  Spain has Zara churning out masks instead of clothes.  Germany has Nivea making alcohol based cleansers instead of facial cream.  Where’s our emergency manufacturing?

In January, Trump's initial response was to concoct a LIE, that the virus was a hoax by the Democrats.  Not only was that a waste of time, it will have lethal outcomes.  Had the Office on Pandemics been operative, We The People would have had early warnings.  We would have followed the models in China and South Korea of isolation far earlier.  Because of Trump's delays, many people will become ill and die.   Their blood will be on Trump's head!  Maybe not!  His preferred hair color is orange, not red.

2020-03-21 02:21:01,"Once a population is on close to lockdown mode, and the symptoms of Covid are fairly well known, I would propose a contrarian view of covid testing; that being that those individuals who are asymptomatic and particularly those individuals living together as a family unit get tested first. The reasoning is as follows... Those individuals who are symptomatic know who they are and can readily isolate themselves from others for a period of time with the assumption that they have the virus. If they have a mild case and recover, they either harbor immunity and won't need to get tested, or if they didn't have the virus, can find out after isolation by being tested later.  If those patients become severely ill, they can go to hospitals and be tested at that time. The most dangerous individuals once a population is in isolation mode, are the patients who are asymptomatic early on in the disease and who harbor the virus, are contagious and don't know it.These are the individuals most likely to spread the disease once a community outbreak is established. Often, these individuals are parents caring for children and adults caring for aging parents.They may be teenagers who are asymptomatic early on and don't believe in quarantine. These are the dangerous individuals who can unknowingly spread the disease and who need to be tested first. Thats why the countries that tested the most individuals early have had the best results so far."

That we supposedly see different mortality artesian different countries is due to try unreliable and in many cases unrealistic data. Keep in mind, official numbers can only reflect a tiny snapshot of the population in direct relation to tests performed. It also makes a huge difference if you test across all demographics (i.e. Germany) or test jut those that are already sick (i.e. Italy) that then also die at a relatively high rate due to the hospitals being overwhelmed unable to cope. That will of course blow numbers out of proportion. Do not look for any official numbers or rates, except one: deaths! Then multiply your deaths x 100 to get an approximation of how many people were infected 3-4 weeks ago. Why 3-4 weeks ago? Because those that die, die weeks into being seriously sick. We then need to project the numbers from 3-4 weeks ago into the presence to get an idea about the least real number of people infected right now using models that factor in exponential growth! Again, deaths x 100 gives us the number of infected people from 3-4 weeks ago - then model into the presence from back then. This model works, as long as we can deal and cope with our ICU patients."

As an expert in pathogenic organisms, I know that the lack of adequate funding in so many health-related sectors will lead to countless unnecessary deaths, on top of long-term financial suffering by millions. I hope the top 1% are enjoying their tax breaks, and have plenty of bog rolls!."

Be the cure for the cancer that is Trump and vote him out of office... 

read from from this NY article.

""The Trump administration is asking state labor officials to delay releasing the precise number of unemployment claims they are fielding, an indication of how uneasy policymakers are about further roiling a stock market already plunging in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

In an email sent Wednesday, the Labor Department instructed state officials to only “provide information using generalities to describe claims levels (very high, large increase)” until the department releases the total number of national claims next Thursday."""
2020-03-20 06:23:09,"Of course the Republicans don’t care about the average American; it’s all about bailing out the corporations. And I’m sure there’s a good amount of pork in there, too. Hopefully Americans will remember the Republican response in November."
2020-03-20 07:32:45,"""The Trump administration is asking state labor officials to delay releasing the precise number of unemployment claims they are fielding,..""

This is a remarkably bad idea. Truth abhors a vacuum. The void of accurate information will immediately be filled with inaccurate information. 

Right now the American people need to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about their circumstances. Doing otherwise will only make matters worse as they inevitably learn the truth the hard way, amidst a swirl of rumors and lies."
2020-03-20 06:46:45,"Trump once again demonstrates he understands narcissism, and little else. Have states withhold unemployment figures? Uncertainty freaks the stock market out. Grand idea - not only withold the figure from the public, but let them know the figures are being withheld, and in the mood today, in the absence of any truth-telling, the market will assume the worst. Trump certainly has experience in this area - e.g., Tell the market that we've got all the medical supplies needed and they're already being shipped out to the medical personnel that need them - and when we find out that Doctors are saying the shortage of protective gear is 'dire', the Trump administration loses its last bits of credibility. Not sure if Trump's next book will be entitled ""The Art of the Lie"", or ""The Art of the Bumble.""  With the number of people who will likely die from the lies and bumbling, it hardly matters."

What of our president and his family? Did they unload stock positions as they claimed everything was going to be OK? yet another problem with the lack of disclosure by Trump and his cronies. Please look into this further and expose the hypocrisy of our elected officials. 

Not only are our representatives betraying us for their own profit, but our lack of preparation is having dire consequences. As a physician, I am struggling to manage our lack of PPE and masks. We are canceling surgeries and emptying our hospitals of patients who are suffering from illness and need our help in preparation for an onslaught of coronavirus patients. People are suffering and will die as a result of our failings in testing and preparation. Physicians and health care workers will become sick and die because of exposure to a pathogen for which we could be better prepared. We have a moral obligation to step into harm’s way. Yet what of society’s and our health system’s reciprocal obligation to protect us from harm? 

In our current transactional selfish culture of lying and self-dealing,I will still honor my obligations and step into harm’s way. Burr should donate his blood money to NC to purchase PPE."

Not again."
2020-03-20 05:56:22,"With regard to drugs under study, Trump needs to stop talking. The nature of science is that there will be a lot of drugs that show early promise, only to fizzle out under more careful scrutiny. Dozens, probably. Given what we know, these compounds should absolutely be checked fully and expeditiously, and no doubt such programs were already well underway when Trump redundantly ordered them to be so; scientists aren't stupid, and they became aware of early results well before Fox News personalities started talking about them.

But hyping particular candidates like this prematurely makes it harder to do the science to determine whether they actually work. It serves no useful purpose.

I'm hardly surprised; conservative media spend more time hawking scams to credulous seniors than anyone (Colloidal silver! Antibacterial toothpaste! Testosterone supplements! Gold coins!). But this is one time when it really matters.

2020-03-20 06:48:51,"Given the dire straights the country is in now, it seems even more foolish how this president gave a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut, 80 percent of which went to corporations and the wealthy.  Moreover, it was delivered during an up economy stabilized by the previous administration...a move no serious economist would recommend doing.

One more time: This is a HUMAN crisis first and foremost. Yes, it is also an economic crisis. But let us not forget that HUMAN life must take precedence over our personal stake in seeing a more buoyant stock market.

I strongly recommend that everyone read the above linked article from Maclean’s magazine of Canada. In particular, the article notes: 

“Most recently, Chinese government propagandists have promoted a bizarre story about the outbreak in Wuhan being caused by the United States Army. … Those stories have since been amplified by Chinese government officials, … Such aggressive Chinese government disinformation about the coronavirus is being deliberately promoted to draw attention away from Beijing’s own responsibility for the global pandemic.”

I have argued in many comments on NYT articles on live developments re the coronavirus pandemic that China must bear the responsibility for launching this international disaster onto the world.

There must be a debate at the UN on the damage and destruction caused by China’s gift to the world that keeps on giving and is taking away and destroying lives and world economies. China must pay for the international impact arising from its incompetence and mismanagement of its unregulated livestock industry and health system that has allowed the coronavirus pandemic to damage the world so extensively. It can afford to do so from its amassed fortune of US$3.12 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves."

Instead of going to a big box store, maybe people can still buy a few things at a local small grocery store. Maybe people can get take-out from a restaurant a few nights a week. I plan on buying fish at my local fish market this morning because they are a treasured business in normal times, and their eat-in restaurant is closed. We need a sort of ""save your local businesses plan,"" buying local being an act of solidarity with neighbors. We need to do what we can to keep putting some money in circulation. I realize some businesses are simply closed and there is nothing to do. We will come out of this eventually."

What if someone lost a job or made dramatically less money in 2019? Let alone being impacted by current circumstances.

What if 2018 was an outlier income year?

Same for other proposals like payroll tax or tax credit. Junk ideas. What use a reduction in payroll tax when there is no income. And why wait for a tax credit, when the need is now.

Put cash in the hands of all Americans."

Well, Bogota got shut down as of midnite last nite - that will last thru midnite Monday which happens to be a ”festiva” - a religious holiday - Day of San Jose.

This total lockdown ordered by Bogota mayor is to test the government machinery in case there may be a more drastic action needed to fight Wuhan virus.

To date - Colombia has reported some 130 cases - luckily no fatality to date. As it's capital and the largest city - Bogota has a majority of cases.  All from recent arrivals from Europe and their contacts.

This 4 day lock down  - ”tocqe de Queda” - in Bogota means every one must stay in doors - except for a run for groceries, pharmacies and other emergencies. 

Buses will run but taxis will not ply and available only thru app.  

No restaurants are allowed to stay open.  

You can take your dog out for a 20 minute walk. 

Police will patrol the city to ensure the lockdown succeeds and what if any additional measures are required.

We've had multiple meetings at my work and have spent many hours preparing for the possibility of working at home, but my boss, bafflingly, is still insisting that we show up in person every other day. I'm literally being forced to put my life at extra risk every time I have to go in, not to mention the lives of my co-workers and my fellow public transportation riders (I don't drive). No one I work with is taking this as seriously as I am; every single one of them is still taking risks they don't have to in their personal lives and  increasing the possibilty they will infect someone else.

2020-03-20 17:27:28,"Since this enormous rescue plan will ultimately be borne by tax payers, I, for one, am strongly recommending that any financial grant to corporations be contingent on performance or rendering of corporate service in the fight against Coronavirus.  For example:  Restaurants serving free meals to medical/health workers and others leading the front line defense.  Manufacturers supplying equipment and supplies.  Car manufacturers making ventilators.  Hotels donating rooms where medical/health workers can rest between shifts.  Retail and furniture businesses donating beds, tables, beddings, tents, etc.  Airlines ferrying equipment and first line responders who need to travel from one work site to another.  Drug/pharmacy companies donating test kits, drugs and medical supplies.  Accounting and auditing firms to do bookkeeping.
Etc.  This administration is also very keen on pushing individual/family welfare recipients to submit proofs/needs justification.  Corporations should be subjected to the same requirements.  
Why should my tax dollars go to mismanaged companies that would have been down and out even before Coronavirus?  Many well-run companies survive all kinds of turbulences, and others that can be rightly proud not to beg for hand-outs.  I am a retired person living on savings accumulated over many years of hard work.  I know how bail-outs work.  It saved the economy during the Obama administration.

For the same reason that all persons boarding aircraft need to undergo the same level of security clearance regardless of the odds that the person is a security risk - it's considered improper ""profiling"" and politically incorrect to single out those who are more suspect.

4) Balanced intake of protein rich foods, fiber, good fats, vegetables, whole grain carbs and appropriate vitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent acquired immune deficiency to COVID-19.
5) Hand washing and hand sanitization as often as possible especially after touching any surfaces, dollar bills, credit cards,hand shakes etc.
6)Bathing every day with anti-bacterial soaps which should also be antiviral.
7) Stress, anxiety and panic could suppress immunity and so avoid any of these emotions.
8) Social distancing of more than 10 feet at all times.
9) Make a dash to testing centers when you have a fever.

Using his usual terms - broken, horrible, a mess, etc - Trump claimed that any delay in his administration's response was because Trump - Mr. I Alone Can Fix It - had too fix everything this past week before they could move ahead.
So, here we are folks. Let the states fight over masks and respirators. And more test kits? Ditto and besides, Trump doesn't want everyone to be tested. Just those with symptoms.

Today, here in Tennessee, the full state legislature has gone off on vacations until at least June 1, secretly passed a flurry of bills to make it harder for laid off workers to get UI, to push millions$ to companies with no more documentation than a wink/nod, and pushed and passed laws that lock down all information about what they have done and are doing now.  I do not speak for all, or even for many or even one, but I detest having taxpayer money paid to lawmakers for per diem and transportation costs to get back to the place they never should have abandoned in the first place.

And remember, please, they are doing all of this under the guise of protection from the virus; which, as you know, is something they do not believe in at all.

Finally I want to stress that  the Chinese Thousand Talents program essentially is a Chinese academic espionage initiative that is operating to steal American intellectual property.  It should be terminated once and for all. The US government finally has seen the light- the research of several Thousand talent investigators has been terminated where some have fled to China and some face Jail time in the USA (Professor Libert Harvard).

2020-03-20 22:14:34,"It may have had its origins in China, but the President, with little useful knowledge created distraction and the all important delay which was / is critical.
Probably equally if not more important is the impact of minimal back up supplies either because those who previously were responsible, no longer there, or a lack of coordination of options just now being mobilized several weeks late.
The latter has severly exposed, and in some cases directly injured precious medical experts and staff who are still not fully tooled for the roles they play.
What it illustrates is yet another example of a Leader who has only his interests at hand with eyes on the financial outcomes and his reelection. Now, they sum up to a net loss on his watch along with the virus legacy in the US incalculable and looks persistent.

I want to know how many people that are dying from coronovirus vs. the basic flu, given testing statistics and at-risk demographics, are we seeing?

Nobody will show those numbers.  We see numbers of deaths vs. those tested.  These numbers have no analog with flu numbers.

I suspect what we've been told is an order of magnitude out of reality.  That maybe this is 3 times as bad as the flu, and that mainly this is caused by easier transmission.

I think everything I've seen is that this is transmitted easier than the flu, but even that is in question.

I'm grateful that the Times is issuing online a daily, free Coronavirus Briefing. I'm a native New Yorker, 17 years in Seattle.

Our wonderful, highly competent and civil governor, Jay Inslee, yesterday held a news conference on the Virus. He said he communicated in the morning with the White House and urged the president to send a hospital ship to the Puget Sound area, as it's the ""epicenter"" of the west coast pandemic.

The ship was also requested by the governor of California.

Surprisingly, the ship, requested by Governor Inslee, would not treat Virus patients, but would treat all others needing emergency help to free up land hospitals to concentrate on Coronavirus.

Last Tuesday evening around 5, I rode my bicycle to a mini beach (Golden Gardens) on Puget Sound in my Ballard neighborhood, and it was full of Seattleites, swarming the beach, as well filling up hundreds of parking spaces with cars.

Last evening, around 5, I went for a walk in the neighborhood and again saw hundreds of people heading toward the beach. They were on foot and on bicycle, jogging and dog-walking.

I guess that there were 1,000 or more people at the beach last Tuesday evening and last night. My guess is that people, including me, are chafing at the bit to get outside."
2020-03-20 21:47:53,"It occurs to me that the stock market drop, assuming it doesn't recover by November, might not hurt Trump in the election. His blind devotees will support him regardless and those on the political fence, the swing voters the Dems desperately need, might decide we still need a (cough, cough) ""businessman"" in the White House to see us through to the other side. I dreadfully hope this isn't the case."

The bear is an equal opportunity destroyer, it does not care about the color of your politics. The reason is simple, the biggest bubble in human history will also lead to the biggest crash in human history. The Fed rescued us in 2000 and 2008, but look at the way it did, by creating a bigger bubble each time. Now the Fed and the politicians are left with two choices, get out of bears way as the 1930s Fed did and allow it to reset everything and start building anew or do what the Japanese Central Bank did in the 1990s, try to bail everyone out serially. There is a long list that will need bailouts starting with Countries, States, Municipalities, Car Makers, Airports, Airlines, Banks, Non-bank lenders, individuals etc. The choice they will make will determine if this downturn will turn into the greater depression (as in the 1930s) or the long depression (as in Japan).

Whatever they do is not going to work; they are clueless. Absolutely clueless! Instead of throwing money at the wall, they’d be far, far better off giving that money to the people. By doing that, they would be shoring up demand. Put money into people’s pockets and you increase demand. This is a demand-side problem, not a supply-side one. The airlines, for example, will not go out of business because they can’t supply the flights, but because there is/will be no demand for flights. At the moment, because people are grounded; but when they are not, they will have little money left over to buy those flight tickets. Ditto, many other industries.

Shore up demand by making sure people will have money in their pockets!"

2020-03-20 22:39:35,"@NYTimes  The attempt to explain away the discrepancy in gender death rates, i.e., the males rate exceed females rate by more than 1%, has at least 1 weakness that refutes the argument from smoking and immune systems.  Seriously men die faster because of the gender role men take upon themselves, as protectors of all, and facing virus pandemic, the role is triggered exponentially. Males need to reject this gender role assignment immediately, especially under pandemic circumstances. The argument from smoking and immune systems is a distinction without a real difference, as whatever the number is, it’s hardly a blip on the radar screen."
2020-03-20 22:43:30,"What, again, was the ""Trump bump""? There was a sustained period of economic growth that was created by two factors (more the first): (i) Obama's response to the 2008 slump and (ii) Paul Ryan's giant corporate tax cuts that artificially inflated the market."

2020-03-20 22:51:47,"The fact that we are now coming to a standstill and potential national lockdown is entirely due to Trump's incompetence, thick-headedness, or unwillingness to take decisive action when there was time.

Trump's press briefings are a clown-show untethered to the truth. The fact is that tests are still not available for those who are suspected to carry the virus, but don't show symptoms yet. This logistical nightmare was entirely avoidable since early warnings by professionals were abundant.

Some Republican Senators in the know quickly dumped their stocks while feeding Americans lies and false assurances.

Now the problem has become a race for resources - and Trump is dithering again. The Nation is still flying blind and needs to hit the brakes, hard. To get ahead of the curve the Nation needs to mobilize its resources and top managerial and logistical talents without delay so that the Nations can cope with the expected tsunami of critically ill people.

Trump would deploy the military to build the border wall, but would not help the states build temporary hospitals. The main purpose of the stimulus plan is to pump up the stock market so Trump would get re-elected. Billions are going to corporations again. All the CEOs should donate their pay. ZERO taxpayer dollars should go to CEO pay in the bailout. The federal government should care for the sick first and stabilize the situation and the investor confidence will return.

Please don't buy the hype that it's all due to increased testing -- New York is not running 60% of the tests in the country. 

California's new cases have largely stabilized with the lockdown in in Northern California since Monday, and with statewide lockdown since today, hopefully we'll see a downward trajectory. 

These numbers are entirely consistent with experiences of other countries that locked down--China, Korea, and Taiwan--and those that didn't, like Italy. Physical separation is the only known ""drug"" that prevents the spread. 

What Cuomo has done is unconscionable, especially because geometric progression means you have to count how many lives could have been saved on the last days, and he can kiss his political future goodbye.  

But this should also give us hope -- if the country locked down for three weeks, the virus would be entirely controlled. However, this strategy will not work if we do this on a rolling basis."

Small businesses are the heart of the economy, not big corporations.  They employ the vast majority of people.  And they operate on small margins.  Being shutdown for even a few weeks is sufficient to put them permanently out of business.  Permanently.  And all the government giveaway programs will not stop that.  There are 157,000,000 American workers.  With virtually every business shutdown, the vast majority of those will be subject to layoffs or firings.  I've heard estimates that unemployment will rise to 2,000,000.  Try 20,000,000 or 50,000,000.  The government should provide the parameters for the group of people with a high risk of serious problems with COVID-19, tell those people to isolate themselves and provide support for them for medical and financial needs as well as providing food and shelter as needed.  For those outside that group, they should be allowed to return to work, following appropriate protocols such as washing hands, maintaining a distance from others, etc.  If that doesn't happen soon, we will inevitably be thrust into a long a painful depression."

For the last three years, you told those of us who knew better that GDP growth, low unemployment, unsustainably low tax rates for the rich, and a booming stock market meant that putting up with such a foul, disgusting, and demented gangster as president of the United States, was worth it all. 

Although Trump did not start the coronavirus, he has done just about everything possible to worsen the situation, and scarcely anything to ameliorate it. He has drastically undermined public confidence in the ability of government to solve the problem, though obviously nobody else can (or could have, with a competent government, which he has undermined at every turn).

And largely as a result, the stock market is crashing, unemployment is soaring, recriminations are mounting, the divisions he caused and worsened are festering. Thousands surely, possibly millions, will die.

So here's my question: Do you regret supporting him? do you repent it? Do you promise never to vote again for any Republican: any Nixon, any Reagan, any Dubya, any Trump?"

2020-03-21 00:01:57,"Please STOP listening to nonsense about the 'malaria drug(s)' which seem to originate from some Trump straw clutching - and is being repeated even here as if the US Covid infection crisis is done and over.

There is the sketchiest information on the efficacy of chloroquine and/or Hydroxychloroquine - essentially obsolete malaria drugs reserved for unusual clinical situations. Both of them show some anticoronaviral activity in the test tube (so do many, many other agents) - that finding tells us that Chloroquine MAY be worthy of further study. That's all. The only clinical trial (as compared with so called 'compassionate use, i.e. administered to patients at death's door) was undertaken in France. It was a small trial and, mainly through ill luck rather than poor trial design, was frustratingly inconclusive - the reason why the WHO wants larger, better studies, quickly. And chloroquine 'cured' nobody. It reduced the Coronavirus count in the lung secretions of Covid sufferers. A bit. That's it. Chloroquine combined with the macrolide antibiotic Azithromycin reduced viral count a bit more.

To date, there's no scientifically acceptable evidence that chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine will help the Covid epidemic. What we do have is the usual gang of gung-ho amateurs shouting 'Give it a go! It can't hurt!"". When that amateur is Donald J Trump, things get dangerous.

Those two drugs have significant side effects. And, yes, some of my patients did get hurt by them."
2020-03-20 23:07:37,"look just keep trump off the TV.  these press conferences have become his new rallies where he was allowed to lie at the rallies and thinks he can continue lying at the press conference. Every time he makes a lie the market drops.

2020-03-20 23:11:23,"Why does Trump feel that he must speak to the American people every day of the week, and why, when he does hold a press conference, does he drag all those other people to stand behind him when they could obviously be doing other, more important things?  It's as if he can't do it alone, he needs support from the yes-men (and a woman or two), who must nod in unison and mention, at least once per person, what a wonderful job he's doing...  He's not, but they're apparently supposed to say that he is.  

Can you imagine ANY president in our history who has demanded such things of members of his administration?  The narcissism of this man is astounding and frightening.  We're in the middle of the worst viral outbreak of my lifetime, and on the brink of a possible recession (or worse) and the POTUS is worried about his poll numbers."

The window during which they believe actions could have been taken to avoid this pandemic.

Do they think millions of masks would have been produced?  That hundreds of thousands of respirators would be ""found""?  That the CDC  test's problems would have been corrected sooner?  That the FDA would have abandoned all control over tests?  That in that 30-60 window every person with symptoms would have been tested?

Perhaps they believe if not for that 1-2 month window being wasted, we be like South Korea, which spent 2 years redesigning its response and eliminating all the obstacles its government faced during MERS."

It doesn't even have to be what most would consider to be bad news.

Although America and Americans are getting more than their fair share of bad news lately, Trump is only concerned about what he considers to be bad news to him personally.

I keep looking at the calendar and thinking about how much more damage Trump can do between now and January 20th of next year and beyond perhaps.

2020-03-21 00:01:02,"Serious question: how long will states imposing strict “shelter in place laws” (eg California) allow free movement of people and goods between their state and the states that are not taking the outbreak seriously? And what will the implications be if a state like California wants to restrict the flow of people and goods coming from states that (as Trump so eloquently put it) are “not affected” by COVID-19 and are “just watching it on television”? 

It’s starting to hit me just how much sacrifice is going to be required of the American people over a very long period of time. And if we are not united as a country with regard to how willing we are to make those sacrifices (and how strictly states are going to enforce quarantines, shelter in place, closure of non essential businesses, etc), it’s going to get ugly."
2020-03-21 00:33:48,"As I wrote to Kevin Zeese of ""Popular Resistance""just a few hours ago:

Kevin, I don’t know how to set-up a humanitarian funding web-site, but I’m guessing you and Margaret do yourselves, or know the kind of charitable fund raising organizations that could provide a lot of help to folks who really need financial help to survive and keep their kids safe.

My thoughts are that many retired folks like myself and Judy are retired and comfortable but in a retirement income-level that is low enough that our government may send us checks that we really don’t need.

I think many many retired folks who have a safe nest egg of moderate wealth, but may receive government checks we don’t need should be encouraged and promoted to send their unnecessarily check amounts (which might just be superfluous bonus money) and send those funds to younger and more desperate families that need more financial support than we need.

The number of families could be very high and amount that could be repurposed or ‘re-gifted’ from moderately comfortable ‘boomers’ to lower income millennials and gen x families could be a life-saver (and would bolster whatever level of direct government checks to families will provide).

If I was to receive a check we don’t really need, I already plan to ‘pay it forward’.

Can Popular Resistance help directly or indirectly network such a plan?

2020-03-20 18:05:41,"The spat between Trump and Peter Alexander at today's coronavirus news conference was unfortunate. Trump should not have accused Mr. Alexander of bad reporting when all he did was ask Trump what he would say to Americans who are worried about their safety.  Without justifying Trump's behavior, what bothered him about Mr. Alexander's question and similar questions is that Trump is trying to give the viewers hope that things are going to get better so that they don't panic or unnecessarily worry.  So he touts the possible use of quinine-based medicines to treat the symptoms of coronavirus even though that has not yet been established.  In Trump's mind, there is no point in emphasizing the odds that the medicines won't work.  If they don't work, they don't work but there is no harm in holding out hope that they will. (Any idiot who rushes to take quinine now without waiting to see if it works deserves whatever harm he/she may incur).  The job of journalists is to get the truth out no matter how much it hurts.  So this tension between emphasizing hope and pointing out the facts will continue."

2020-03-20 21:47:58,"The New York Times reports that ""Asian Americans have reported incidents of racial slurs and physical abuse because of the erroneous perception that China is the cause of the virus."" Unfortunately, this sentence reflects the biased reporting which Mr. Trump exploits to fire up his followers.
1) The words ""have reported"" leads to a Twitter link where a Chinese woman reports that when she was taking out the trash, some boorish man hurled an obscenity and the word Chinese at her. Following the Twitter feed, someone else comments ""White people are showing their true colors."" 
The blanket statement that these racial slur(s)--only one is referenced--and physical abuse--none is referenced--resulted from the Coronavirus overlooks the simple fact that there is thuggish behavior in this country. 
2) The words ""erroneous perception that China is the cause of the virus"" is tendentious and false. The government of China is to a degree the cause of the virus. Policies of food safety did apparently allow the virus to pass from animals to humans. Chinese internal political policies led to a deplorable coverup of the situation which wasted valuable time.
For all of this, Trump's neologism China virus is of no value and will not be adopted. The term ""coronavirus""--simple and memorable--is the term most Americans will use for this virus, except for the ultra correct few who will use Covid19 virus to show they know there are more than one type of coronavirus."

He's perfectly capable of giving sound overview remarks and introducing each of the scientific & medical experts. His demeanor is by far more professional and mature. He won't engage in gratuitous insults of the press. And, even with the bombastic bigot Mike Pompeo occasionally sharing the stage, I do not think Pence will engage in blatant race-baiting that only antagonizes the nation which will emerge from this pandemic crisis as the new global leader."

What I do care about are all the usual racists saying that China did this to attack us. China has suffered thousands of deaths, trillions in losses. A virus is a lousy military weapon, because it can't be pointed at an exact target.

BTW, among the racists in other countries who hate Americans is being floated the theory that the US military developed the virus and released it in Wuhan. Why? What advantage would we get from killing thousands of Chinese and wrecking their economy? And why not in the capital, Beijing, or the financial capital, Shanghai, if you wanted to cause the most damage?  Why Wuhan?

2) what the current situation underscores is the old rule of thumb, that the government pares its debt or at least lowers its deficits during good times (not done in the last 3 years) so it has more room to maneuver during and emergency or downturn, both of which we will fully experience; it pares its debt or lowers deficits by raising taxes in good times on those who can most afford it; Obama never should have made permanent the Bush tax cuts, though I'm not sure he could have over-ridden the GOP and timid dems in the senate; Trump worsened the fiscal situation even more; the stimulus called for now will dwarf several times that in 2009 from Obama which the GOP still screams about."

Back then, a portion of people were laid-off but not forced to stop working on a massive scale. 

It’s easy to throw out numbers in a comments forum, but this will take at least $5T (properly distributed), and massively raising taxes on the wealthy to get the market to its mid-February high within 2-3 years.

SECOND: Talk about poison pills. A corporate tax cut disguised as an economic stimulus? Puhleeze. Many major corporations don't pay a penny in U.S. taxes because they've moved their corporate addresses to the Isle of Skye or some such place. Moreover, didn't our corporations receive enough of a break when they got their $1.8 trillion Christmas gift tax in 2017?

The SBA exists to help small business with loans.  The VA exists to help vets.  SSA, SSI, Medicare and Medicaid exist for all who are eligible.  These safety net programs could and should be expanded as needed because of the virus. 

I am retired.  Even if I qualify for a direct payment, why should I get it?  I haven't lost a job.  My income hasn't changed.  I have lost net-worth in the market, but that was a risk I knowingly took when I put money there (and when I readily accepted ridiculously high gains in recent years).

We have am existing infrastructure of government programs that are thoughtfully designed to provide people support when they qualify for it.  Let's utilize the safety net--and if a payout is to occur, let's hold off till businesses are back in operation so there are more places (especially small businesses) to spend the give-away money so that it will at least stimulate what will be a broken economy."

Well today they’re building a tent outside and they have repurposed dorms. He was given a letter to show to police officers that he is critical personnel so he can get to Manhattan. 
Last night I learnt that his boss tested positive for Covid19. He defied a NJ town quarantine because he had to work to run things but did stay home when symptoms showed up. 
Another co-worker has been home with 102.5 unable or unwilling to get a test.
Another has declared she needs a mask even though the COO sent an e-mail to everyone that mask supply is running low for personnel that comes in contact with patients. 
Another of his staff has a daughter whose teacher tested positive for the virus. Last Friday one of the daughter’s best friends drowned in the Hudson with another teen. 
I’ve been spraying and wiping everything my husband touches at home from the moment he comes back. Last night he was glassy eyed, like Mayor De Blasio. 
Mr. President, how do we keep it together? How do we stay strong? I learnt that our Governor can get the National Guard to build more beds. We still need them. We need more people. We need supplies of al sorts. The hospitals in out city are under tremendous pressure.

2020-03-21 03:03:43,"Why in the world aren't we spending $1 trillion to stop the spread and make face masks and ventilators? We're wasting money trying to prop up the economy, just waiting for enough people to get infected or die before we wake up. This is the stupidest response possible."
2020-03-21 03:18:28,"Any economic relief package should begin with relief for those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum, NOT at the top! No more tax cuts for the rich!! No more millions to large corporations who will just use the money for bonuses for their executives, not for their employees. Shame on Congress for giving in to the Republicans on these issues! The Republicans are using this crisis to further ""feather their nests"" and those of their wealthy supporters. Shame on all of you! The CEO's of large corporations should stop taking their salaries and give the money to the wage earners who work for them. This is an economic apocalypse people; time to stand up and be counted on the side of fairness and justice!"

2020-03-21 06:44:56,"With regard to the closure of the borders with our good neighbors Canada and Mexico, at last check, Canada had about 1,100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Mexico had less than 200.  Meanwhile, the US is hurtling toward 20,000 confirmed cases.  While even one more case in our country doesn’t help, you have to ask, who is being kept out of where?

It would seem that our President will do anything to keep people out of our country since it pleases his base.  And then he complains about others injecting politics into this grave matter?  Please, save it for the jury."
2020-03-21 11:15:58,Jeff Bezos should also give a check to every American. Especially since his company is going to increase profits through all of this and still not pay taxes to the Fed. Shameful.
2020-03-21 07:35:28,"Closing down transport whether by air, sea or land should have been the very first move, but by all accounts, transport seems to be still very much open, giving this virus room to roam the world."
2020-03-21 02:57:07,Trump is clearly delusional. At what point will the 25th Amendment be executed? And what price will have to be paid before that is allowed to happen ?
2020-03-21 03:13:13,"Trump proves on a daily basis that he is incompetent, a liar, and a charlatan.

Nothing that comes out of his mouth should be relied upon.

On November 3, 2020 vote Trump out of office, along with every one of his Republican enablers who is up for election, especially Moscow Mitch McConnell.

Vote as if YOUR LIFE, YOUR FINANCIAL WELLBEING, and our democracy, depend on it, BECAUSE THEY DO.

Vote BLUE, no matter who, top to bottom, for all federal, state and local offices."
2020-03-21 06:31:10,"There is now enough data and articles from multiple reputable news sources showing what epidemiologists and statistical gurus have known for a while — but have been afraid to say in the shadow of our President’s denials and ego — that the situation in the US is following the curve already seen in Italy, only we are about a week to 10 days behind.  And while our fatalities may be slightly blunted because the US population is younger than Italy’s, the toll will likely be high.  It’s just math.

Many governors and mayors across the country are taking action on their own to restrict activity and improve social distancing, but the blatant incompetence and lack of leadership at the Federal level has left us with a patchwork of preventive measures when we need a strong, unified approach to provide the needed medical resources in a timely way, and a strict nation-wide lockdown with teeth for violators to slow the virus’ spread.  It is the only way to avoid the coming swell of serious cases of COVID-19 that will completely overwhelm our hospitals and ICUs, resulting in horrendously difficult triage decisions and many more deaths, particularly of our older citizens.  These are the impossible and unfortunate choices that the Italians are having to make now, and our lack of strong unified action will likely mean we will have to make those same terrible decisions. 

In his actions, inactions, falsehoods, and ineptitude, our President has provided a textbook example of negligence."
2020-03-21 06:52:18,"It would be a bit more comforting if we were to hear that the White House, Senate and House were working overtime to get more test kits, ventilators and masks rather than simply worrying about the stock market.  You know, the market they've already sold out of or shorted.

And, BTW, if you folks in DC want to consider a huge financial calamity on the horizon, just wait until all the health claims hit the private insurers."
2020-03-21 11:35:01,What has happened to American ingenuity and sense of possibility?  Action the best ideas now!

""I have a feeling . . ."" 

I have a feeling too."
2020-03-21 03:57:28,"Earlier today, I thought that this crisis needs the likes of General Russell Honoré, the commander of the Joint Task Force for Katrina. And lo and behold he just showed up on the MSNBC’s 11th Hour. He suggested putting all the nurses and doctors who will be graduating this May to work now to help care for the sick.

The stable genius needs more people of General Honoré’s caliber on his team!"
2020-03-21 03:59:11,"In 09 not one Republican in the House voted for Obama's stimulus that was to avoid a depression and only three in the Senate. People need to quit comparing Democrats and Republicans and saying that they're the same. 
I truly believe now if there was a Democratic president that the Republicans again would let us burn and let people starve to make that president look bad. No soul."
2020-03-21 02:03:10,"All Trump cares about is engineering his re-election. So as lazy and incompetent as they are, he and the GOP simply throw money at the problem.  But the have no interest in fixing what Trump broke, planning and a national health care policy for the future (or what they call ""socialism"").

Everyone I have talked with the last few days--a lot of scattered family members mostly--think it is stupid to send out measly government checks that won't cover much in people's lives to keep their heads above water without going bankrupt.

How about this idea?  Take the $500 billion and provide free health care for anyone with the coronavirus who is hospitalized or has expensive medical costs for treatment but has no or lousy health insurance.  

It is a special fund, and doctors, medical services, and hospitals bill the government's special fund for payment (as Medicare does).  This fund late provides the basis for a medicare type government health insurance for the uninsured and those who want the option of a government plan.

Here's another idea:  Any corporation who receives large amounts of money from the government for this epidemic disaster, must give back something to the public in return.  For example, how about banks allow a moratorium on mortgage payments for those who do not get paid because of the epidemic and market meltdown?"
2020-03-21 04:04:55,"What a criminal disparity in who gets a test.  So many in DC right now have symptoms, have even been in contact with some folks who tested positive, and can't even get tested themselves, yet folks who are not ill yet who are prominent politically have easy access.  No surprise, but perhaps if there was some kind of legal mandate of equity in who has access to such tests during a pandemic, there would not have been such a shortage in the first place.  Plan for the future?"
2020-03-21 02:34:20,I respect your publication but am puzzled at this headline. I am living in IL and no one in ordering me to stay indoors.
2020-03-20 05:47:55,"Why is it that every time Trump opens his mouth, more lies, exaggerations and misinformation comes out?  The administration is totally unable to control what he says, lest they be fired on the spot.  The general public either disbelieve everything he says, which means they're not getting information or believe everything he says, which means they don't think there is a problem, or that it will quickly be solved.

He needs to shut up, go and play golf and let people that actually know what they're talking about front the response.  From the growth in numbers, it's starting to look like Italy will be safer than the USA."
2020-03-20 07:03:04,How anyone could still align with the Republican Party at this point is well beyond my level of comprehension.
2020-03-21 12:36:47,"NO to any bailout of big business that does not require that the monies go to salaries and wages first.  Profit-taking from a public handout cannot happen again like it did during the mortgage financial crisis in 2008.

Also, big business can afford a haircut.  They received a windfall with Trump's 14% tax cut at the beginning of his presidency (let's hope that this is the end of it..)

The US Treasury is NOT Trump's piggy bank...it must work this time for working people and their families."
2020-03-21 13:58:15,"The virus will ultimately be manageable. 

Getting Trump and his team to lead this country responsibly will not be possible. 

Trump continues to be a con man. 

A con man doesn’t hire an honest wo/man to work for him. 

Trump will lie until he can lie no more. 

Trump will continue to damage this country and its institutions over the next 9 months. 

The markets will not stabilize because a con man is at the helm. 

The country will not get healthier because a con man is at the helm. 

People will die unnecessarily because a con man is at the helm. 

Trump is a liar with no gray area. 

Trump does not care about his base.

Trump does not care about our country. 

Trump does not care about our constitution. 

The only thing his base and I, along with the rest of the country, have in common, is that Trump doesn’t care about any of us. 

He doesn’t even care about the people he gave tax cuts too. 

He would just as quickly throw his own children under the bus. 

Trump is a con man. 

He is dangerous to everyone. 

End his time in office in November before he completely destroys this country, its people (us), and our economy. 

He will strip this country if its strength if we don’t get him out. 

Look at the risk we really in now because just weeks ago he called the virus a hoax. 

That “little” lie took away a quarter of the stock market value, took jobs away from millions, closed countless small businesses and ultimately will have caused the untimely deaths of U.S. citizens."
2020-03-21 14:25:34,"Let’s take a quick look at what is happening (by way of a few recent NYT headlines) because Trump is at the helm.

1. U.S. is plunged into deeper disruption and paralysis

2. Coronavirus recession looms, its course unrecognizable

3. The coronaviruses rampage through a nursing home 

4. Starbucks is closing cafes and stocks sink

5. Senate debates $1 trillion rescue plan

6. With new state decrees, 1 in 5 Americans ordered to stay home 

7. Dow Ends 11-Year Bull Market as Coronavirus Defies Economic Remedies

8. Another Virus Victim: The U.S. as a Global Leader in a Time of Crisis

These may not even be the best representation of the disaster Trump has brought this country to. 

The best representation will come from the headlines that have yet to be written as this unfolds. 

Trump is a disaster and a massive threat to everyone, including, and perhaps especially, his base."
2020-03-21 02:37:09,"Anthrax, polio, cholera, Influenza, all raced through human populations, took a toll and ended.  Coronavirus is less deadly a virus and can end if left to run through and expire.  The false hope that government actions can remand the result doubles the harm.  Stop efforts to 'tamp the curve' it is futile and a greater harm than the virus, for it destroys human civilization by ruin."
2020-03-21 02:01:55,"Thank God for President Trump.

He understands the enormous magnitude of the problem and can deal with it."
2020-03-21 00:54:17,"In World War 2 death benefits to the families of those 400,000 GI’s that didn’t return were under $1500. That’s roughly what each American family expects now to help the dislocation from the Chinese Corona Virus that has claimed less than 200 Americans over 4 months in a year with 12,000 ordinary Flu fatalities. 

How did we get here ?"
2020-03-21 00:12:22,All $1200 is gonna get us is 10 days of groceries and maybe pay the electric bill.  Makes me wish I were born a casino or a cruise ship.
2020-03-18 13:32:06,"Moot question. Athletes know how lax and cynical Japan was in this epidemic; no one will show up. 
The Olympic brand, founded in 1896, was a novelty in its time. It has expired."
2020-03-18 13:51:24,This is a no brainer. Postpone it. I can't believe they haven't done this already.  It is NOT worth the risk.
2020-03-18 13:53:28,Absolutely not.  Everyone is going to lose a lot of money.  The point is to stay alive.
2020-03-18 13:57:32,"This is not brain surgery.  It seems inconceivable that they are still pondering whether or not to hold the games.   Of course
cancel/postpone and  then be thankful more people won't get sick and/or die."
2020-03-18 14:02:53,"Sadly, the Games will not go on because governments will have imposed such draconian restrictions on their publics that they will not be able to attend. Once governments impose restrictions on their publics as now exist they will not let go in time for people to attend the games. So called experts will always raise the specter of possible infection. People, everywhere, live in police states now where only the government will release them from captivity. Once governments have captivated their own people they will be reluctant to let them go"
2020-03-18 14:14:24,There will certainly not be an Olympics.  Best to cancel it now and focus like a laser on containing and eradicating this virus.
2020-03-18 14:19:22,"Ultimately, countries will decide not to send their athletes for health and safety reasons.  That will decide the fate of the games.  But that is not the best way to go forward.  It is much better for the IOC to be proactive and postpone the games."
2020-03-18 14:20:51,"Maybe Japan should do a better job of testing people for the virus, so there can be an accurate picture of the degree of infection. Look next door to South Korea for an example. 

It’s so similar to the Japanese government’s handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster: obfuscation, avoidance, denial. In the meantime, lives are needlessly endangered."
2020-03-18 14:22:34,"While the virus spread could [hopefully] be on the tail end of the curve in late July, the underlying fear of this strain is going to last for a long time.

The Olympics will not happen.

The apparently ability for it to spread before signs of infection is a very complicated medical issue to deal with."
2020-03-18 14:25:43,"They may not be cancelled, but other than perhaps Japanese spectators, no one will be there, including international athletes.

Way, way past time that the Olympics were scrapped.  I stopped watch decades ago after they started adding team sports and non-sports, not to mention the vulgar ""Up Close and Personal"" bios of the athletes (gag).  The final coup de grace for me was when watching the woman's 5,000 meter they cut away to cover  a beach blanket bikini volley ball game for 20 minutes before cutting back for the last lap."
2020-03-18 14:38:29,"Japanese officials allowed 1,000 people off the Diamond Princess without testing or quarantine, if I remember correctly. Some of them went back home on public transportation. Yet the official number of patients remains under 1,000 without counting the Diamond Princess. Businesses have not shut down. Some clubs are still open. Travel and tours are still being conducted. And testing is not given widely as many seem to think. While the government says they’re testing, in reality testing is limited and very hard to get. Why the discrepancy? Abe is putting money over people. The public and private sectors are both determined to recoup their investment in the Olympics."
2020-03-18 14:16:12,"Since this article did not give a definitive answer allow me NO the Olympics will not take place this summer. It will be either summer 2021 or 2022,"
2020-03-18 13:24:41,"I’m not an expert, but I’d be amazed if this goes off on time. I know how hard Japan has worked on this now. But the Japanese are not stupid.  I think they will realize it’s better to postpone."
2020-03-18 13:20:23,"Cancel it! If not, then boycott it.

Health before profits."
2020-03-18 13:36:02,"Yes, the Olympics will happen. But with some new events, such as the Ventilator Distance Throw and the 100 m Sprint while hooked to an IV stand."
2020-03-18 13:37:35,"Get rid of the Olympics, permanently."
2020-03-18 13:46:11,"If they do, it would be tantamount to manslaughter. Completely irresponsible."
2020-03-18 13:55:57,If for some crazy reason the Olympics goes on. We need to boycott it. This is madness.
2020-03-18 13:34:01,What nonsense the Olympics are toast. Fagetaboutit. Nuff sed?
2020-03-18 13:36:28,"Um, no."
2020-03-18 13:37:48,“No.”
2020-03-18 14:52:14,"Until a vaccine is developed and widely disseminated there will be no Olympics. The money is hardly wasted. It will go on in four years, presumably where matters left off like everything else in the world.

The sooner people internalize the reality of the situation, the sooner the world will move forward. Denial is understandable but ultimately unproductive."
2020-03-18 15:02:32,"I would like to suggest an alternative method for putting on the Olympics. It would not work during a pandemic but it would lessen the economic consequences.

Have the opening ceremonies in Greece for every Olympics. All the athletes would gather there to celebrate their achievements and bond with each other.

The athletes would then disburse to various athletic sites around the planet. No need to build new stadiums every four years. Use existing infrastructure. 

The athletes would then return to Greece for a closing ceremony; or, each venue could put one on. The flame of course would go back to Greece.

Hopefully many countries could share the wealth and the risk of putting on the Olympics. Peace."
2020-03-18 15:15:55,"I hope the games can go normally. This pandemic might pass as quickly as it came. Maybe first devise a series of options: go as planned starting late July, delay 2~3 weeks, and delay 1 year. Observe how things evolve and schedule all regional qualifying rounds accordingly. 
Japan has put lots of efforts and resources into the preparation so that the world can enjoy and cheer. In the worst case, the games could be delayed but still must go on. 
Best of luck Tokyo!  Your friend from the neighboring city of Seoul."
2020-03-18 15:41:57,Olympics are always a bad bet for the hosting city. Pick 2 venues: one for summer and one for winter and stick with these every cycle.
2020-03-18 16:05:17,"Damage from the virus to Japan will be several trillion dollars.  Time to put things in perspective.  Postponing for a year under the assumption that the virus will be gone, or least mitigated, will give a great boost to Japan just when it's needed."
2020-03-18 17:25:26,"If I'm a young world-class athlete, am I going to risk my health and life just to show up in Japan this summer--which in only 3 months away?  I don't think so.  This whole argument is about M-O-N-E-Y.  I have felt for some time that the best option is to select a permanent location for the summer and winter games.  But, the IOC is corrupt so that will never happen.  Too much M-O-N-E-Y at stake."
2020-03-18 17:26:51,"Will nations allow their athletes, and crew to attend?  With restrictions on gathering etc. will athletes be able to train? Will the public wish to attend, be allowed to travel?  Not likely.  Postponing will at least give Japan a chance to recoup, and is that decision not up to the IOC?"
2020-03-18 17:54:51,"The Japanese government’s well-publicized misreporting on the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Crisis has eroded their credibility so much, people around the world are questioning the government’s reporting on the scale of COVID-19. The tight restrictions on testing, of course, is adding fuel to the suspicion that Japanese government is trying to keep the number of infections low so it can go ahead with the Olympics. 

As so many are pointing out, even if most of the advanced countries stem the tide of COVID-19, the virus is just taking off in the developing world. How meaningful will the Olympics be when majority of the countries in the world are in a medical crisis and under the travel ban? The most well-payed and protected athletes in the world are testing positive for COVID-19 (NBA stars for instance) as are heads of sports organization (including Japan’s president of Football Association who may have spread the virus in multiple countries from Amsterdam to U.S. to Japan).

Thankfully, the Olympics is on a four-year schedule. It seems appropriate that 2020 Olympics will be held in 2021–leaving a permanent record in the most important annals of sports that in 2020, we experienced a global crisis that rivaled World War II."
2020-03-18 15:48:00,There is always a postponement - be creative.
2020-03-18 16:40:35,"The Olympics is being postponed until a later time, that is all!"
2020-03-18 17:18:01,"Hello, Japan's businesses.  Do you believe it's sensible to bring tens of  thousands of athletes and spectators from the four corners of this pestilent world to gather in one place in Japan when we are in the midst of the worst epidemic in the last century?  It's not going to happen, and you might as well recognize that fact now.  It would be utter nonsense to think otherwise."
2020-03-18 18:51:27,"Well, I was going to Tokyo and will still go if normalcy returns.

While businesses are definitely concerned - it's the athletes who I feel the most sympathy for.

In many sports - the Olympics is a one shot just like the city that holds it.

I have been to several Olympics and have met and chatted with many athletes.

For most, just to be at an Olympiad itself is unbelievable.  And to represent their country is also quite overwhelming.

Not only many train for almost all of their young life - and suspend all other life that their peers enjoy.  Often, they totally isolate themselves from all - and in many cases, their own families.

And many families sacrifice a great deal - emotional and financial content wise.

While it is easy for us to say postpone the Tokyo - many athletes use their own countdown clock to train to prepare for that one day of glory.

So, this uncertainty is no good - especially to kids who will be in their first  and my be, the only Olympics.

So, at least in favor of these athletes, sooner Tokyo decision is made - better for all."

2020-03-18 22:06:04,"The only thing that really motivates the IOC is money. The Olympic games were supposed to be about nations getting together and celebrating achievements. Now it is all about profit, destroying the environment to build stadiums, winning gold only (as in ad from the Atlanta Games: “you don’t win silver, you lose gold”🤮) and watching athletes pumped up on drugs and steroids..."
2020-03-18 22:22:41,"If I were a betting man, my money would be on the games being cancelled. The games are over four months away. I see no reason to cancel them at this point. Who knows where we'll be?The heat may or may not wipe out the virus. Strict testing will be in place. If Japan and the affected businesses want to gamble at this point, let them. Unlike the other sports and events that were immediately postponed or cancelled, there is plenty of time."
2020-03-18 22:51:55,"I'm just wondering if I were not Japanese, I would come to visit to see the Olympic games under current circumstances. Maybe no, but I can understand people who would like games to be held. It is because those people have been working hard for the games. It's a tough decision. All we can do it just wait..."
2020-03-19 02:21:23,"How in god’s name can they have a huge international event with people packed into stadiums? I’m thinking about the very popular gymnastics especially. 
    When I first saw that the virus was spreading out of China I just had that same feeling that the Olympics would be dangerous. 
     It’s sad for the athletes , but do we want to risk their health or possibly their lives ? I mean let’s get real . This is our World War 3 . 
     I hope they cancel the Olympics  and put it on when this virus has a vaccine ."
2020-03-19 05:17:09,"Spending money on Olympics preparation is not a bad bet, a bad bet is assuming that in a pandemic, bringing in millions of people from four corners of the world, in close proximity, and into a country of mostly senior citizens, will be safe. It doesn’t get any dumber or more reckless than that."
2020-03-19 08:41:32,"International tourist visits to Japan have been increasing hugely in recent years, regardless of the Olympics, so if Japan and the IOC mishandle the Olympics question during this pandemic Japan's fast-growing tourism industry could suffer catastrophically and lose a lot more money in the future than the Olympics would bring in.  Therefore, this is not even about national economics for Japan, but more about an Olympic global photo-op for self-aggrandizing ""leadership"" and the stubborn refusal of Japan's ""leadership"" to have their agenda challenged. Inside Japan the ""leadership"" get away with this reality-denying attitude, given the hierarchical nature of the culture and weak political opposition, but it's not going to fly with many people beyond Japan's borders. There would be plenty of understanding and goodwill for Japan if they moved the Olympics now to 2021, but the window for making that gesture is closing fast."

Those of us that have been around know to stash away whatever we can when the gigs are plentiful, because it’s not always going to rain money. We’ve been very lucky the last 10 years as concerts and events have exploded around the world, but those of us who remember the lean days of 2007/8 and post-9/11 have been through something like this before, though not on this scale. It’s a great reminder that, for all the talk of “family” and “togetherness” on the road, once the bus stops, you’re on your own. 

Make no mistake, we’ve chosen this lifestyle and we don’t expect sympathy or pity. But something other than a “payroll tax break” for massive corporations and bailouts for Wall Street banks, things that won’t affect our lives in the least from the government that we help put billions of tax dollars into every year, would be nice."

2020-03-17 14:56:45,"I'm a self-employed sound designer and composer for the theatre. My work is overwhelmingly classified by 1099-MISC contracts, which means I cannot apply for benefits or unemployment. I had four shows lined up over the next five weeks. In the last 24 hours, all of them have been cancelled or postponed. I am terrified."
2020-03-17 15:13:12,"Thank you Ben for a sober & well written piece. Too many of these types of articles focus on the flashing lights & stars rather than the everyday people who make it all happen. You would probably not be surprised to learn that it's typically not a very lucrative living either.

I would add that similar work pools also exist for the television industry, and unlike previous economic turndowns, they are also sitting at home with no options for unemployment benefits or help."
2020-03-17 15:22:14,"Consider the free-lance classical (or jazz) musician. Barely surviving on as many gigs as they can put together, now all is canceled except perhaps lessons given by video. By the time this is over, it may be summer, which means a few more idle months. And how much will resume in the fall, if things ever go back to normal? How permanently will much of social behavior be changed? This could become disastrous beyond all measure. A universal income may become an absolute necessity, and the worst result would be a complete migration of life onto the internet."
2020-03-17 15:53:09,"The same situation is faced by workers in the sports TV industry that employs freelance camera operators, graphics operators, directors and technical directors, sound technicians, engineers, and more.  All are paid by the event and have no benefits, no health insurance or 401K's.  A payroll tax cut would not help these people as long as they are not employed.  It is game over for the length of the suspension of games in all professional sports leagues."
2020-03-17 16:20:25,"Consider France’s intermittent du spectacle system. 

Out here, non-salaried entertainment industry workers who have worked over a minimum number of hours in the previous year (43 gigs for musicians and actors, and a higher number for techniciens, with a minimum amount of pay of about 180 euros for the gig to be technically legal) are eligible for a daily stipend for the following twelve months. The stipend is dependent on the amount of money you made and the amount of gigs you played, and it starts at 43 euros. That is 1290 euros a month garunteed minimum if you don’t play any gigs. Days you play gigs you don’t get the stipend, but you are paid for your gig. Money you earn on your gigs is taxed about 55%, but that is money you get back along with much more, if you do the calculations. Here in France it is hard to get rich in the performing industry, but no one is really poor. And money isn’t important if you do what you love and are healthy.

Did I mention France has free health care for all?

After living here, I can’t imagine being a performing artist in the US. There is no safety net (for the low season, in case of injury, for times the artist needs to create and not perform). And in case of a major disaster such as this one... well we already can see the fallout. I am sure there are major flaws (debt?) to the system here, but for now I am happy to ride the wave of government funding of performing arts."
2020-03-17 16:45:33,"When I worked for the Eagles (a long time ago), the motto was:

""All for one, and you're on your own.""

Same as it ever was..."
2020-03-17 17:45:26,"Concert promoters like Live Nation and AEG use plenty of 1099 ""independent contractors"" at their shows (runners, in-house backstage help, etc) who do not work independently at all, but are paid as such. They work at the behest of the company for whichever tour or show comes into town. Promoters have been using this labor force for years, getting away without paying benefits by cutting workers' hours short who work too many in a year.  There is no safety net for them, and no bail out by the companies they serve so loyally."
