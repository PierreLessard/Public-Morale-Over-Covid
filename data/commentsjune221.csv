Wow. It’s been known for a long time that anti-virals for certain types of infections need to be given very early in the course of infection. I’m surprised that no one thought to investigate that possibility at the outset of the pandemic."
2021-06-17 20:45:25,This could be like a renaissance of basic research to￼ develop antiviral drugs against all types of infections like previously happened with antibiotics - lots of morbidity and mortality occurs from viruses - nobels may be handed out for some of these results.

But, in the past two months, we've also seen availability of Pfizer and Moderna go up tremendously (as mentioned in the article).  In March, the calculus was get any dose as soon as possible and one couldn't afford to be picky.  Now, anyone who is actually motivated to seek out a vaccine has a choice, and most of them are choosing to be ""inconvenienced"" by an extra dose of PFE or MRNA because 95% sounds a lot better than 72%."
2021-06-18 10:50:15,"""people started to get this concept that maybe there’s something better about being immunized with Pfizer and Moderna.”

Yes, what a concept. The MRNA vaccines are more effective and devoid of the miniscule yet still present dangers of the J&J vaccine. They are also more effficacious than the J&J vaccine after a SINGLE dose. We have also been widely informed that the second dose of the MRNA vaccines is needed to establish an immune response 'memory', leading to popular speculation that the J&J vaccine does will not provide enduring protection. 

Johnson & Johnson made an inferior product. People do not want to settle for it. Even here in Germany, I have friends who are desperate to be vaccinated yet have turned down offers for the J&J vaccine. I don't blame them. It has effectively become a class-structured vaccination program, with MRNA for those with advantages and J&J or Astrazeneca for everyone else."

A shameful failure."

2021-06-18 11:11:44,"One other possible reason for the low interest is there has been zero CDC statements or 
media reporting about J&J’s efficacy against variances, compared to lots of reassurances regarding the success of the mRNA, at least after two doses.  As one of the 11 million who got the J&J because experts said to take whatever was available, I frankly feel abandoned and very worried when I read about the very low efficacy of single mRNA doses."
2021-06-18 11:22:12,"To read this article is to realize that the American public is taking a 'consumer' approach to getting vaccinated.  ""What's the scuttlebutt on this or that vaccine? Should I refuse a vaccine offered by my medical provider, and hold out for something I hear is better?""  The fact is that Johnson & Johnson and Astrazeneca are highly effective vaccines.  What is persistently not mentioned when their ~75% efficacy is compared to the ~95%efficacy of Pfizer and Moderna is that all  four give almost 100% protection against serious or fatal cases of Covid.  And all four are statistically MUCH safer than getting Covid in its many variants.  The western world has lost touch with the realities of life lived under the constant threat of serious, contagious diseases.  At the soup kitchen in our UK community we hope that Johnson & Johnson will be a life-saver for homeless people, who are unlikely to return for second jabs.  Under the UK NHS, we are not given a choice of vaccine; I have had Astrazeneca, my husband had Pfizer.  Get vaccinated as soon as you can, and let's beat the notion of a class-structured vaccine program.  It's based on misinformation, and a false sense of safety in a western world that's forgotten what things used to be like."
2021-06-18 11:28:34,I already got corona while going to a Black Coffee concert in Tulum Mexico in January and I felt like getting two shots was overkill (plus I hate needles) so the Janssen vax was perfect for me in order to get a vaccine card and fly around internationally as it is accepted in the EU too.  I think for the people like me who basically didn’t know we had corona until after the fact this is a perfect vaccine to perk up the immune system a bit more and get the paperwork in place as well as get the herb immunity stats up since obviously many cases such as mine went unreported.
2021-06-18 10:46:01,"It was a mistake halting the vaccine in retrospect. It is a good vaccine and, because of its single-dose, regular storage form, would have been very good for administration in rural populations and in the younger.

2021-06-18 11:23:07,"The 10-day pause by the Federal Drug Administration virtually killed any hopes that the J&J vaccine would be widely distributed. And, there was nothing brief about it.

For what reason would the FDA sit on a decision about the vaccine for 10 days? The FDA announced the pause and set a meeting to consider the vaccine several days later. Several days! What? It's as if the FDA is on ""island time"" instead of a war footing against this killer virus. And, all of this because of a side effect that can occur less than one in a million shots. 

The unspoken secret all along was that, of course the J&J vaccine would be given the second green light to go forward, just maybe with a caution advisory for certain individuals. The FDA, in slow-walking its review, didn't take the advice of the CDC on most everything related to the pandemic: better to be proactive because the risks of doing nothing are far greater.

Congressman Meijer was right: Every day of delay by the FDA meant more doubts in the minds of the American people.

If the FDA were Tylenol during its safety scare many decades ago, the commissioners would be working around the clock, eating pizza and sleeping the hallways, to review all the data they could find to make the right decision. But the commissioners efforts were ""good enough for government"".

As a result many people are suffering with long Covid and others have died because of the delays in the Federal Drug Administration and its commissioners."
2021-06-18 11:45:05,"It is so frustrating and tragic to watch the Western world stand by idly while thousands of people are dying each day and millions more have lost their livelihoods due to lockdowns. The failure of the US to supply vaccines to countries in SEA, Africa and LATAM while their need is dire will not be forgotten by their people,  and the Chinese will take, and are taking advantage. There is no alternative for many of these countries, and they are having to choose between using Chinese vaccines of dubious efficacy and lockdowns that will devastate the economy, especially as WFH may not be an option for many. Meanwhile people in the US are picking and choosing and throwing away vaccines by the thousands. Sad to see how far the US has fallen."
2021-06-18 11:28:29,"When in our history of vaccines have the consumers been given the choice, the authority, to determine what vaccine is good for them? I can't grasp this attitude that is being accepted as fact. It is as if the public is choosing designer jeans or designer shoes.

The J&J vaccine has so much to offer yet it's just not popular in a country that lives by what is popular rather than good."

That has long disappeared into the old American belief in  exceptionalism. That has degraded our national sense of community to the degree that it has become a ""what's in it for ME"" idea.  It's not ""how do I help my community (others) & myself to survive & thrive.""  

Commenter J in the UK is right on target. 

We Americans will face a dark future because of our  needless sense of ""rugged individualism"" & that idea that parts of this country are better than others.  We will be lost to our national selfishness no matter how many wonderful stories we see on TV & in our newspapers about a FEW good people helping others.

Americans are notorious for our selfishness as well as for our generosity. The selfishness is overcoming the generosity by leaps & bounds.  We are turning into the United States of Amazon, Google, Facebook, & the rest of Big Tech.

I can only think that we'll get what we deserve. The future may belong to China, Russia & all the other authoritarian dictatorships where belief in community has only ONE approved expression.  The rest go up against a wall in front of a firing squad. All we are doing is building our own firing squads & walls."

For many places where the choice is no vaccine or J&J, it is clear that J&J is an excellent choice and one our country ought to make possible by sending our unused vaccine elsewhere."

I hope more people will get the shot."
2021-06-18 11:38:08,This is not surprising. Americans concerned enough about their health to get the vaccine don't want the J&J shot because it's less effective and can cause blood clots in very rare instances. They chose safety and efficacy over convenience.
2021-06-18 11:16:37,"If these are expiring, they should be shipped to India. There is no excuse for letting vaccines expire when the virus is raging in countries which still have little to no vaccine because the first world has taken them.

2021-06-18 10:45:33,"The fact that at such a critical moment in a life-threatening pandemic, this vaccine has to be disposed because of incompetent production and contamination is really depressing.  For me, the J&J vaccine is like the Ford Pinto and the Boeing 737-8:  classic American disasters."

I joke that with J&J I got the ""dollar store vaccine."" I got mine just a couple days before the pause, and I wonder if it came from that troubled manufacturing facility in Baltimore. I didn't realize just how few of us got that shot here in the US, and I confess, it makes me feel a bit weird about it. 
I hope that smart people are figuring out if booster shots will be useful and when to get them -- and whether people like me would benefit from taking one of the other vaccines as a booster. If I could, I'd layer up with a Pfizer or Moderna right now!"
2021-06-18 12:00:09,It's not access.  People are choosing not to get vaccinated.  Last year I endured an avalanche of campaign commercials.  It's a shame that a similar effort has not been launched on behalf of vaccines.
2021-06-18 10:57:41,"Any potential side effects along with lesser efficacy pales to the fact that Emergent BioSolutions had no business producing the vaccine. They were awarded a contract through very suspect relations and have had a myriad of failures previously.

2021-06-18 12:40:52,"I volunteered recently in a mobile vaccine clinic held in a community immigrants in a mobile home park. I think access  is a big part of the reason many do not get vaccinated. Having the vaccine clinic come to the community, without the need to make appointments, at times when people are off work, along with a team of health care professionals who can answer questions and dispel misinformation in the language people use is key. Another key is not requiring a photo ID, a barrier to immigrants who fear disclosing personal information. There was initial resistance to the J&J vaccine, but in the end, “one and done” was what most people chose."

No appointments, no buggy websites, no IDs, no forms. No standing around in a CVS in an enclosed room for 2 hours waiting for the pharmacist to be ready in the middle of an epidemic. I would have waited 5 hours, I don't care, but not everybody will or even can.
There are some differences due to limited supply, but they just need to make this easier for people. However they can."
2021-06-18 12:45:34,"When I scheduled my appointment at a local instore pharmacy, they had one option listed - Moderna. I learned after the fact that they also had J&J, but used it only if they had five commitments for the day. They could have at least listed it as an option with a caveat. I would’ve gladly waited until they accumulated four others, because I am more comfortable with the single dose, traditionally developed J & J vaccine."
2021-06-18 12:51:06,"With today’s hyper-charged news cycle, it’s no wonder that people would hear about a pause and make up their minds that the shot is irredeemable. There’s no guarantee that they will hear the updated information, and the resumption of shots would naturally draw a lot less fanfare in the press. 

I understand the tough spots the decision makers were in: be viewed as hiding something or risk the loss of faith in the JNJ shot. The anti-vaxxers would seize on whichever way they went. This is a classic example of the failure of science communication, and an indictment on our public education that has sowed the seeds of distrust and disinformation through the lack of good information.

It’s hard to be optimistic that anything will change in the near term. The human mind is not evolved to recognize microscopic threats, but it sure is evolved to recognize perceived threat from other humans in power."

I wonder, what is the role (if any) of the media in pointing these things out, and maybe prodding the government to take humanitarian action that is only common sense.

2021-06-18 12:50:56,"This article gives the false impression that 'consumer choice' was involved. No one presented me with a menu when I got vaccinated, nor anyone I know. You took what the authorities provided.

The reality is that J & J contracted with a company that botched millions of doses, and then had distribution temporarily halted owing to the side-effect question. 

If there was 'vaccine hesitancy' it was on the part of public health authorities and distributors of the vaccine, who of course were less likely to go with the J & J vaccine, despite the advantages it offered for many people.

The biggest issue was the contamination, and the blame for that lies squarely with J & J - the contractor they chose did not have adequate know-how, and the company clearly did not monitor what the contractor was doing until it was too late."

It has helped many vaccine hesitant persons decide to safely get vaccinated. In this article the focus on making the story about health care disparities improving outcomes with J &J’s vaccine is ridiculous. The disparity here is that Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine is likely less safe, clearly less effective and was produced on the cheap possibly with a good helping of corrupt and shoddy practices. It seems to me that targeting marginalized and poor people with an inferior vaccine in such a crisis is itself a blatant health care disparity. The answer is better public health resources to help for example that homeless person get the second Moderna or Pfizer shot."

Telling people that it's impossible to say that 95 percent efficacy is better than 74 percent because the latter figure is from later data with more variants, while ignoring even more recent data from Israel showing the gold-standard effectiveness of mRNA, is an obvious lie and people aren't falling for it."

If the reason for the push was the misconception that people were not getting vaccinated because 2 shots of Pfizer or Moderna were needed, then the J&J problems did the opposite and made people more wary of the vaccines.  I really hope the push by the government was not to assist J&J in recouping the costs of their less effective vaccine."

When it was my turn, they tried the same thing with me-- making me get the Pfizer one instead-- when I requested the J&J shot, as had been promised to me on their site when I scheduled the appointment. They kept saying that they didn't want to thaw the whole vial because they wouldn't be able to use up the whole multi-dose vial during the day, even though there are only four or five doses per vial, and two people (including myself) had already requested it while I was in the store. I believe the Pfizer vials have like twelve doses each. They finally conceded and gave me the J&J shot, but I had to be visibly cranky and demand it. It was absolutely ridiculous."
2021-06-18 13:01:49,Its amazing the authors of the article never mentioned what a disastrous blunder it was for the FDA and CDC to pull the vaccine for a week when the data was so weak and whatever analysis was needed could have been done behind the scene.
2021-06-18 12:40:53,"It's important to remember that, before the J&J debacle, Biden's vaccine distribution plan forbade ""inequitable"" distribution of J&J versus other vaccines.

Prisoners, homeless people, migrant workers, or people of color were required to have the same relative percentages of each type of vaccine.

This meant that the one-and-done J&J could never have been fully deployed for populations that are harder to track.

The blood clot and manufacturing debacles were just two nails in the coffin."
2021-06-18 11:49:30,"Now booster shots are in the offing. Is J&J back in business when it comes to booster shots? Are the vaccines compatible? If you received a J&J vaccine, is Pfizer’s booster appropriate or Moderna and visa versa?
I think the public should have answers before any further vaccines are considered."
2021-06-18 12:35:04,I don't understand why J&J doesn't give these vax to Brazil or India  or some other needy country like Nepal rather than letting them expire ?
2021-06-18 12:39:36,"I had the J&J shot when we were told to get what you can. 

I'd like to know how much time needs to pass before I can get either Pfizer or Moderna. Is there medical advice on this yet?"
2021-06-18 13:11:49,"I'm surprised that the one-and-done concept doesn't make this vaccine more appealing to people, especially those who are contending with busy work schedules or those who would find scheduling the second dose of another option difficult. That's why I got J&J, and I'm glad I did. That said, the more people choose any vaccine at all, the better."
2021-06-18 13:14:32,"Disclosure: I received the J&J vaccine and am immunocompromised. My antibody levels were negligible (thankful I have some) and it’s as if I’m not protected. Others with my clinical profile who got the MRNA vaccines produced a strong immune response.
—
It has been so discouraging to read article after article, and study after study, touting the effectiveness of the 2-dose MRNA vaccines in various settings with no mention of the J&J  vaccine. On the J&J front, there has essentially been radio silence (aside from reports of blood clotting, the pause, and vast contamination issues). All policy decisions are being made using data from the MRNA vaccines. 

The silence has been deafening. 

Continuing the trend, with the Delta variant and its increased transmissibility, there has been absolutely no data on J&J efficacy. People, myself included, are rightfully scared and a little angry. We desperately need guidance from the FDA/CDC on an MRNA booster (being done in other countries) to increase our protection. 

We were told to get the first vaccine we could, but no one signed up for being an afterthought. 

Lastly, we need to start broaching the subject of *undervaccinated* people. We talk about unvaccinated/partially vaccinated/fully vaccinated. But there is a growing group of people who are technically fully vaccinated and not fully protected. The CDC needs to begin addressing this group as a valid segment of the population that needs distinct guidelines."
2021-06-18 11:16:50,"Today, Canada receives 1,000,000 Moderna doses donated by the US.  My guess is that they are approaching expiry dates.

We lead the world in first doses given per capita after getting off to a late start because we rely on other countries for our vaccines that we purchase.

Our second-dose numbers are quickly rising, and our rates of cases and deaths are very much better than the US.

Astra Zeneca is now being phased out of use here after it was relied on in the early months due to unavailability or the mRNA vaccines.

As to Emergent Biosolutions, it just paid executives big bonuses for the profits made from the US government contracts.  Disgraceful."
2021-06-18 11:23:46,"The pause on the vaccine was an epic blunder that has caused, and will continue to cause, loss of life.  The cowardly bureaucrats responsible should be fired."
2021-06-18 11:50:24,What a shame. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is the one that I took. I preferred it because it was one shot. I was also a little suspicious of the Rna technology used in the other vaccines.
2021-06-18 12:14:11,"One man’s anecdote: I got the J&J back in March and my life is 99% back to normal. Traveling internationally for work and pleasure. No stress going out for dinner. Shaking hands with people! HUGGING people!

It’s wonderful."
2021-06-18 12:39:17,Disappointing...the fact that manufacturing was the issue screams volumes of where the US falls short globally.  It's not okay.
2021-06-18 12:46:32,"Sorry folks, but I do not have sympathy for people who choose not to get vaccinated. Period."
2021-06-18 12:01:34,"""The vaccine’s appeal has dropped after several controversies, and experts now say that the U.S. has missed a big opportunity to tackle health disparities.""

That is in the subheadline on the front page.  Although the fact that health outcomes are not equal for everyone in this country is important, is that really what this article is about?  Is the Times perhaps taking the opportunity to reiterate its constant message that not everybody is equal?

In my area, I see big signs that point you where to go for Covid vaccines, walk-in, no appointment necessary.  As far as the vaccine is concerned, it seems to me that it is available to anyone who wants it, at least around here.  ""Health disparities"" may be real, but I don't see how the events described in this article are particularly relevant."
2021-06-18 12:10:50,Why haven’t these vaccines been redistributed? We have health care providers around the world still valiantly working to save lives. We have many neighbor nations who are in desperate straights because the pandemic still rages there.  We are better than this!
2021-06-18 13:09:04,"People may be subconsciously equating the J&J vaccine’s problems with J&J’s recent issues with cancer-causing talcum power. Given all the tumult in the world, people could be forgiven for thinking “hey, they couldn’t get talcum powder right, maybe I should pause on the infinitely-more-complicated-to-produce vaccine?” I’m not saying it’s “right” or “fair” but people are entitled to be discerning when their health is on the line - especially after the very traumatic period when Trump was mishandling the pandemic, suggesting people inject themselves with bleach, etc."
2021-06-18 13:23:35,"For the life of me, I don't understand why they aren't sending doses to Canada and Mexico before they expire. Maybe cull everything within 10 days of expiration and get it sent! I understand that it's a whole bureaucratic and refrigeration event, but really. Our North American neighbors would be so grateful. They are way behind us in terms of doses. It benefits all of us if they are protected."
2021-06-18 12:31:24,"US citizens and those travelling there to get vaccinated are incredibly lucky to have options while the majority of countries in the southern hemisphere will take anything they can get. 

Send the incredibly effective J&J vaccine to COVAX and get the rest of the world vaccinated or employ vaccine diplomacy, so folks see a US-backed firm in their clinics rather than Sinovac. Optics, man."
2021-06-18 13:04:26,"Let’s be careful to differentiate economic and media induced concerns from medical concerns. The fact that J&J was not the first to the finish line, and uses conventional technology does not bother me. mRNA is new, and we don’t’ know how durable its protection will over time. Both I and my solid organ transplant recipient, immunosuppressed son, received mRNA because, we’re at very high risk, and we wanted protection ASAP. I would take J&J now as a booster or as a primary vax. If cleared by his docs he would too because mRNA is barely effective for solid organ tx patients. 
Ignore J&J’s decision to go to Emergent for manufacturing. Emergent is a fraud and their management should be pilloried. The fact that J&J was more interested in the science than making huge dollars manufacturing, is actually a plus for me. Beware the Trojan Horse manufacturer trying to boost manufacturing revenues. 
J&J uses a more conventional technology, one that is more akin to what we see with other viral vaxes, in this case a disabled adenovirus as a carrier. We’ve all had these kinds of vaccines. It is more stable, storable, transportable. It is 66% effective, which is a little better than the flu vaccine. For all we yet know, that 66% may last forever, while mRNA might atrophy after 6 mos. J&J does carry of TTS, the platelet clotting issue but those warnings are directed solely at women between teen-ages and say the ‘50s. Even so, actual incidents are very rare. 
Let’s not give up on this."
2021-06-18 13:06:52,"Has anyone noticed the amazing cognitive disconnect between covid vaccination and drug advertisements?

People gloss over a drug’s multiple, serious hazards or contraindications to treat, say, psoriatic skin patches, but will stop cold if the vaccine has a one in several million complication rate.

Psychologists, here is your chance to contribute to the national dialogue."
2021-06-18 13:14:27,"""he United States missed a critical opportunity to address health disparities with a vaccine that should have been ideal for reaching vulnerable populations""

Officials went door to door with J&J vaccines in my neighborhood and people didn't take them. Not much more could have been done to reach those communities, other than shut down the propaganda facebook groups and WhatsApp group chats spreading misinformation about the vaccines."
2021-06-18 13:09:32,I never had much faith in the viral vector vaccines on my part. Their construction is complicated and they have only been used to date within clinical trials for mostly fatal diseases. Big Pharma saw the juicy apple of a pandemic dangling in front of them and grabbed the opportunity to bite hard at the chance to throw VV vaccines into millions of bodies and avoid liability. Luckily for America it didn’t work out. Hopefully moving forward our public health monitoring systems will be at full strength and vaccines can be manufactured quickly using the mRNA format.
2021-06-18 13:26:32,"So don't take it amiss, but before any vaccine goes somewhere in America over the expiration date, a delivery offer could be made to another country. Even if you have to take money for it, a buyer should be found."
2021-06-18 13:36:44,"The FDA and CDC pulled the J&J for a pause when some 2 cases per million blood clots were reported. FDA and CDC wrongly believed that it would only increase the confidence in vaccines if it put a pause. They knew well all they had to do was to give medical practitioner s advice on how to treat blood clots arising from the J&J vaccine. The CDC's political advisory committee made things worse by deciding to meet again in a week and delayed approval for another week. That sapped confidence in the vaccine. I hope FDA and CDC do learn from this for the future. If there is no danger and only change in practices need to be announced, there is no need to withdraw a treatment or drug because it does more harm than good."
2021-06-18 13:39:47,"I said from the beginning that the J&J vaccine would be the only one I would take. As a person with MS and on treatment I was not comfortable getting vaccinated but took the one shot chance. There is no way I am getting a booster shot of a vaccine that requires two shots.  

If the J&J vaccine was not available the vaccination rate would have been even lower because many of us with specific illnesses took this vaccine. I still believe the media overhyped the issues with J&J  in comparison to issues with other vaccines.  Double tapping people is much more profitable than a single tap and I believe that was the real issue."
2021-06-18 13:42:20,"Perhaps it is the vaccine adverse and vaccine hesitant who are missing the opportunity? They leave themselves vulnerable to the disease. 

I was vaccinated before J and J was available. My wife received J and J as it was easiest vaccine available to her when she became eligible. My son received J and J two days after he was eligible and instead of Pfizer."
2021-06-18 13:56:01,"Working at a Bronx clinic I have seen firsthand some of the reasons this vaccine fell flat.  We were asked by the city to create lists of vulnerable home bound people who were interested in receiving the shot.  We assembled the list.  Then I heard back that the criteria for the program were prohibitive and that most of our listed patients would not qualify.  The entire process was canceled at my clinic.  Patients had to be entirely home bound with assistive devices, over a certain age, etc."
2021-06-18 13:47:17,"I had the J&J shot right before the pause.  I would take it again in a heartbeat.  The side effects were minimal, and it was nice to be ""one and done.""  A shame that this happened."
2021-06-18 13:21:09,"Echoing the comment that this article is negligent in not considering the idea that pausing the shots due to - what was it, 6? 13?  - cases of blood clots, most of which were not fatal, was a big problem."
2021-06-18 13:44:32,Please do not let J&J vaccine expire. The poor countries will be happy to use them.
2021-06-18 14:13:44,"It didn't help the vaccine's credibility when a concerted effort was made to convince people that the Janssen vaccine was just as effective as the mRNA ones. Even though the efficacy rate in the US was 72%, we were told that we couldn't really compare this to the mRNA vaccines and this was just as good. A little common sense would tell you that this isn't the case; we not have real world data that suggests that all these vaccines are performing in line with their Phase 3 numbers and that the mRNA vaccines are actually better. 

A more sound approach would have been to be upfront that the efficacy of this vaccine was a bit lower, but still very good. It could have been targeted specifically to the populace that was at lower risk. And in retrospect, the FDA should not have paused it when they got news of blood clots. They've obviously learned their lesson. The mRNA vaccines are not being paused in spite of reports of cases of myocarditis in younger people."
2021-06-18 13:33:48,"I waited for the J&J and frankly, this whole problem, has been created by corporate manipulation by drug companies and our easily corrupted FDA.
Remember the competition over HIV drugs when they finally were created?
One and done was a big time threat. 
So, I hope they can use this vaccine in countries where one and done will make a giant difference.
The numbers on this drug and the fact that it was tested with some variants before it hit the market made the decision in this home...The other two were not tested with variants prior to release....
The risk of blood clots from birth control pills is also proven and real... Don't see millions of women throwing out their dosage...Heart inflammation issues in some teenagers from other vaccines..This issue is being over played for competitive advantage......Business motives seem to create these problems and we should verify and then trust as consumers."
2021-06-18 14:07:55,"It seems to me, in so many more ways than one, this pandemic has exposed all the ways in which our society is plagued by a dearth of actual experts, and is concurrently being overrun by people who think themselves smart but in fact aren’t. 

So many aspects of this entire situation have been bungled by poorly-considered or -executed communication, or ill-thought-out plans, which revealed themselves to be not plans at all, but stalling masquerading as competent planning. Everyone holding fast to their own ideology through it all, while making it appear as if the experience was shifting their perspective. 

Our political leaders are worthless, and ignorant, and many of the corporate leaders are similarly worthless and incompetent. They barely had the ability to lead us through this pandemic, and they got through by force of luck, not through any competent leadership or foresight and ability to project ahead. 

I come out of this experience severely disheartened and frightened at what this says about the world we actually live in. I’m realizing now that my pandemic malaise is actually that feeling."
2021-06-18 14:22:41,"Take the ""almost expiring"" doses and mass vaccinate the homeless, distribute to rural areas and donate immediate to Carribean and Central American countries. Anything less is unconscionable. The point of the ""one and done"" and the gift of this easily refrigerated vaccine is that people outside of the urban/suburban American wealth and comfort can also get a vaccine. When will Americans realize we all breath the same air? Only in the U.S. do spoiled, affluent people refuse free medical care. It is an embarrassment and a sign of a seriously adolescent cultural mindset. Wasting vaccines is the ultimate American entitlement and a sin if there ever was one."
2021-06-18 14:20:31,"This article really angers me because my husband and I got the J&J vaccine, relying on reporting that it was safe and effective. Now I find myself wondering how safe we are as the Delta variant emerges. Should we have held out for Pfizer or Moderna?"
2021-06-18 14:27:14,"Are we sure that people are choosing to not get the J & J vaccine?  Or are they just choosing to not get vaccinated at all?  

Some blame also falls on the federal government for awarding Emergent such a large contract without the accompanying oversight for this critical vaccine."
2021-06-18 13:58:29,"Every state imaginable held back vaccines for 'minority' and the under- served. NYT itself wrote workers were going door-to-door offering it in poor neighborhoods in NYC. Of course, it was declined.

Sorry, my dad is 78, woke up and wheeled my mom down their wheelchair in rural Ohio after a snowstorm to get vaccinated. No more excuses for everyone else who has had it laid at their feet. 

Time to start treating them like adults. If a vaccine is held back for you, with a free Lyft ride to the site and you say no, I don't care anymore."
2021-06-18 14:12:15,"What I think this article leaves out is that the J&J vaccine is — by design — more difficult to manufacture. That’s because it’s an older technology — an adenovirus vaccine. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the newer mRNA vaccine type which makes them easier to mass produce and flood the market with.

If the J&J was able to be mass produced as quickly and in comparative numbers to the mRNA vaccines, I believe it would be more common. What I’m arguing is this should also be a story about an improvement — perhaps a revolution — in vaccine technology."
2021-06-18 14:12:29,The US public has proved itself undeserving of the kind of medical and scientific capability that it has at its disposal.
2021-06-18 13:46:39,"Dr here
I thought J&J could have ended the pandemic worldwide. FDA decision to pause it was disastrous. After that, trust plummeted not just here but worldwide. Add in manufacturing failures with tainted doses and here we are. 

Just think. Poor rural community in Asia or Africa. One shot and done. How hard to do a two shot vax when you have so little infrastructure."
2021-06-18 13:47:08,"I wish this article (or others) would include more substantive information on any specific concerns about the J&J vaccine. Instead we get a re-hash of the hesitation and acceptance issues, but no details about what might really be wrong (if anything) with this shot. Let’s talk more about what researchers found related to the clot issue, and what exactly was wrong with the millions of doses that have to be destroyed in Baltimore. We know the susceptibility of the public to hype and rumor, but is any concern warranted at this point?"
2021-06-18 13:54:47,"The 9 members of the NYY—players and staff—who had breakthrough cases of covid after vaccination, had received the J&J vaccine. Most were asymptomatic. A few had mild symptoms. 


There seems to perhaps be anecdotal evidence that the J&J could be more prone to breakthrough cases vs the mRNA vaccines. 

It would be useful to know if the recent breakthrough cases on cruise ships were following J&J vaccinations."
2021-06-18 14:24:30,I had the J and J vaccine as a 50+ Asian female and had a slight backache for a day and then gone. It's funny how the media tends to tout the Moderna and Pfizer shots as the holy grail in the US but the J and J shots is seen as lesser of the three which it is not. Once again media and doctors tout the efficacy of the MrNA  but leave out J and J in the conversation. It's probably because it is not as fancy and shiny using this new approach to vaccine. I took the J and J because personally I didn't want the MrNA is my system. I read all the info that is is very safe but no one really knows long term effects. Of course no ones knows the long term effects in J and J but at least this method as been used to combat other viruses. I have known people who are still dealing with some unusual side effect with the MrNA vaccine 4 months later after their shot. Haven't heard any issues with the J and J shot months later so far. Thought J and J have had their issues with distribution and manufacturing I would still get the shot again.
2021-06-18 13:37:30,"I received the JJ vaccine in March and was happy to get it.

Now, I wonder if a JJ booster is needed, will it still be around or will it be OK to get one of the other two shot vaccines?

The carelessness and sloppiness in manufacturing has hurt so many who would have benefited from this vaccine. 

Unbelievable!

The unused doses should immediately be DONATED to countries in need."
2021-06-18 13:53:17,"Obviously this is bad for J&J and its shareholders but there are two viable alternatives, Moderna and Pfizer, which, when properly administered, have proven to be highly effective, even against the new delta strain of The Virus, even if you need to take it twice, which given the alternative, hardly seems like an inconvenience at all."
2021-06-18 13:30:46,"I had the opportunity to get the J & J vaccine but opted for the Moderna shots. Why? Moderna was more effective. It isn't complicated. Also, more people are openly choosing to skip vaccination, leaving more vaccines on the shelves. 

It's shameful that we're relegating the J&J vaccine to those who are least advantaged because it's the most convenient to deliver. Feels like throwing them the crumbs of what our medical community has to offer."
2021-06-18 13:45:52,"Most countries are dying for the J&J vaccine.  It is the huge success of Operation Warp Speed, that we have the choices and supply that we do.
In fact, four companies that received funds, plus Pfizer which received a large advance order, developed successful vaccines.  No other country can begin to match it."
2021-06-18 14:04:39,"I see that this is being portrayed as an injustice, soon to be turned into a product and monetized by the press.  Highly dubious premise.

These vaccines were available to all, free of charge, in every corner of the nation, with amazing speed.  I got the J&J vaccine and it was satisfactory in every way."
2021-06-18 14:11:13,There has been some mention of having J&J vaccine on hand at ERs and urgent care clinics. A large percentage of medically underserved people get their care at these facilities and a one and done approach could vastly expand the pool of immunized Americans.
2021-06-18 14:11:14,"The infusions  I  sometimes take for MS have a higher rate of deadly consequences, including an untreatable fatal brain infection, than the J&J vaccine. Also at t the end of commercials touting new medicine the list of potential risks are quite frightening. 

The  establishment hysterics over the J&J vaccine raises some serious questions. I would like to see a report breaking down the profitability difference between the one shot vs the two shot vaccine.  I suspect money making was a bit factor in the hysterics."
2021-06-18 14:38:43,For a future article:  I got the J&J vaccine but should I get one of the others given all the concerns?  I have had no ill effects or covid symptoms before or after getting the vaccine but given the ease of getting vaccinated why not get the Pfizer vaccine?
2021-06-18 14:39:37,"Regardless of the maker of the vaccine, the US should have a policy to distribute all vaccines to countries in need once the expiration date is one week out.  We have plenty, many don't.  To allow large numbers of doses to expire should be avoided and risks emergence of more variants."
2021-06-18 14:40:24,"I am not an expert on vaccines and can't speak to issues of efficacy and side effects. However, I simply can't understand why primary care and family physicians were left out of the loop.

What a waste if it doesn't get encouraged to be a big part of the worldwide vaccine solution.  

I just heard an NPR report yesterday about how there are almost no vaccines being administered in Haiti.  The J & J would be perfect for troubled nations like Haiti since administering a single dose is hard enough.

And this is the world and the US is the nation that has rockets that now reenter the Earth's atmosphere and land right back down on the pad and you can order your favorite widget and have it delivered to you in one or two days from anywhere in this nation?

Let's use an analogy.   You were on the Titanic when it sunk.  You are in a lifeboat which has room for more people.  You row up to people in  the water and urge them  to get in the lifeboat but  they refuse.  You continue to urge them to get in the lifeboat but they continue to refuse.  You hear other people in the  water desperately crying for help.  You row over to those people  and save them.   Your goal is to show compassion to everybody in the water and to save all those lives that are willing to be saved.  I believe that's where we are now"
2021-06-18 14:32:03,"Blaming Johnson and Johnson for hiring a bad contractor is fair. Blaming it for the fact that the Republican Party has made vaccination unpopular among their dim cult members is nonsense.  In Colorado, you could also blame the ignorant clowns, like Lauren Boebert, Ken Buck and Doug Lambert, who are the representatives for the portions of the state most resistant to the vaccine.  Just imagine what might have happened if Boebert and her fellow Republican representatives had taken it on themselves to encourage their constituents to get vaccinated rather than pretend it was all some hoax."
2021-06-18 14:35:58,The problem from the start was the untruth promoted by many in public health that you should “just take whatever vaccine is offered to you” as they are “all really great”. This was reminiscent of the “you don’t need a mask unless your a healthcare worker” from earlier in the pandemic and people saw it for the sham it was.
2021-06-18 13:23:39,"It's time to offer these close dated shots to any country who wants them. Almost everyone in the US who wanted a shot already got it, or has easy access. No sense in wasting what the world needs."

2021-06-18 14:42:17,"Social media is not a reliable source of information on science or much else.  What was missed here was an opportunity to educate the entire country on how science works and what the problems meant.  Very few Americans read anything other than the popular news of the day.  Unfortunately that popular news included the most flamboyant ""facts"" about the various vaccines without the accompanying facts.

The chances of complications from any of the vaccines was very low.  The efficacy of all the vaccines offered was fairly high.  Problems like the ones we saw with the one shot J&J vaccine were rare.  Contamination problems were caught.  That is what needed to be emphasized.  

What needs to be addressed is how many people still need to be vaccinated versus how many of them can take off the time needed to get two shots or one.  Most workplaces have not been all that accommodating.  And most people cannot afford to lose the money to get more than one shot.  

If there's one thing this pandemic has shown us, unless we're GOP members, it's that the US is a deeply unequal nation for all but the richest.  The entire vaccine set up was too dependent upon internet access, concentrated in too few places that were inconvenient for many people to get to, and highly inefficient.  

The internet is not the place to run a health program."
2021-06-18 11:24:04,"J&J has a 72% efficacy rating. Moderna and Pfizer have 90% plus.  Millions of J&J doses were contaminated at the Baltimore plant.

Yeah, it is really hard to understand why people have turned against the J&J vaccine."
2021-06-18 11:27:00,Would the efficacy of the J&J vaccine increase if people were given two doses of it. That would be one way of using up the unused doses before they spoil.
2021-06-18 13:07:19,"As has been explained ad nauseum, comparing efficacy rates between the three vaccines is comparing apples to oranges.  The studies were conducted at different times and in different areas.  Of course the efficacy rate is going to be different. But the important statistic - severe COVID requiring hospitalization or resulting in death - is virtually identical among the three.  The chance of clotting occurring with J&J is nearly zero. In fact, there have been more cases of myocarditis after getting Pfizer or Moderna.  But the odds are still miniscule.  We do not live in a zero risk world, despite the fantasies of those who think it can be so.  Getting out of bed every day carries a risk.  So for those of you who think that J&J is “inferior” and “risky”, but haven’t gotten a vaccine because it’s too inconvenient to get two doses, or you’re unable to miss work because of potential side effects, take a refresher science course and then go get your J&J shot when you have two days off in a row.  You’ll be one and done.  For those of you who somehow feel you made the “better” choice with Pfizer or Moderna, you could also benefit from a refresher class.

Left to their individual abilities to process information for which they have no underlying knowledge most follow their age peers’ responses with the exception of the right wing nuts and left anti-vaxer shamans of mumbled incantations over supplements.

J&J performed remarkable R&D on an abbreviated timeline achieving a viable vaccine using standard vaccine technology. Without the usual years of clinical trials the side effects now noted would never have been noticed outside of the industry. The third-party contractor under preCOVID norms would have been vetted and monitored differently. The fact that the Company devoted their scientists and labs to the vaccine’s discovery is well worth public appreciation and acknowledgment. The same goes for Astra Zeneca. Along with others, excluding Pfizer, the highly skilled scientific work was done without commercial profitability targets or 10 yr sales goals. We all benefited from every COVID 19 vaccine development project in learning more about the strengths and vulnerabilities of the virus itself and the resultant disease. These companies through the labors of their skilled employees are heroes.

2021-06-18 14:14:52,"Early on the message  was get the first vaccine possible. The lower efficacy of J & J b(60-75%)compared to Moderna or Pfizer (94%) was possibly due to it being tested when there were more variants circulating. Real world studies today show mRNA vaccines are still in the 94% range and superior to J & J. Sure, they’re both good but one might keep you from even getting Covid. But the real concerning issue now is people who got J & J  have the right to be worried about the new Delta variant when studies show AstraZeneca (viral vector like J & J) is according to one study only 33% effective without  the 2nd shot. There have been no published studies I see about how J & J is against Delta variant. So it sounds great to send the extra J &J vaccines tp where they are needed but is it effective against this variant?A US trial is  currently underway of following up J & J with a Moderna shot. These results  need to be made available as soon as possible. It doesn’t matter that J & J is “one and done.”  . It’s possible that following up J & J with mRNA will provide even better protection than 2 mRNA shots as shown by recent trial in Spain with AstraZeneca (viral vector like J & J) followed up by Pfizer.  CDC and FDA - do the right thing so the 11 million people who got J &J are protected. I would hate to see those who got J & J being told that 50-60 % protection is good enough as opposed to the 90% plus protection mRNA vaccines have given 137 million Americans."
2021-06-18 14:17:33,"Here we go again. The 95% vs 72% noted in the article is wildly misleading. J&J was developed later, tested on a different strains and used different criteria and methodology. All three vaccines have basically the level of effectiveness."
2021-06-18 14:54:19,"When the approval of the J&J vaccine was announced, like many, I expected it to quickly become the dominant vaccine choice.  It's one and done dosage and ease of storage are significant advantages to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  Then when another NJ pharma giant, Merck, decided to join J&J in production, I thought it would merely a matter of time before it eclipsed both Pfizer and Moderna.   
Little did I know.

Even before the possible side-effect concerns and production issues became news, the J&J vaccine had to contend with public comparisons to the other two vaccines.  Social media unfairly likened the J&J vaccine to low end economy car and the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to Ferraris and Rolls Royce.   Those analogies were civil when compared to others.  At that point I feared the public perception of the J&J vaccine would decrease its demand.  The missteps that followed certainly haven't helped.

All of this have little to do with the efficacy of the vaccine, and while I took the first vaccine available to me (Pfizer), I would take the J&J vaccine in a heartbeat.  
I am rooting for J&J.  It still represents one of the best methods to get this planet past the scourge of Covid-19."

2021-06-18 14:58:48,"This is a real shame. My friends and I who got the J&J aren’t in any struggling demographic, but the fact that we only needed one jab lifted one emotional burden in an already difficult time. It would be a good option not just for those with housing or transportation issues, but people simply scared of having to face a needle twice, plus the potential side effects. I had none with the J&J, not even a bruise."
2021-06-18 14:42:47,"As a case study, the trajectory of the J&J vaccine has some intriguing elements. For one thing, it represented a competing paradigm - one dose, versus the two-dose regimen that was being discussed extensively (in terms of how the second dose puts one over the moon in terms of protection). It was linked to an adverse event (blood clots), and therefore paused, with a concomitant (and unmet?) need for public education to contextualize that episode. It's biggest producer fell short on critical quality control.

I hope that our work vis-a-vis this pandemic includes formally studying these - and all other - aspects of our response and thereby developing a brilliant playbook for the next pandemic. With such a guide, we'll be set up to do well even if, when the next one hits, we again happen to have incompetent and even destructive helmsmanship at that moment."
2021-06-18 14:43:17,"I got the JJ shot during the early days when it was hard to book an appointment.  I wasn't told in advance what shot I was getting and almost walked out of the line.  Now I regret it, having a 30% chance of getting COVID with all the people who won't get any shot worries me.  Knowing that I might not be hospitalized when I get it is not a comfort.  I won't feel comfortable in crowds,  and certainly wouldn't travel to Louisiana or any other low vaccine state.  I hope a  ""booster "" with Moderna of Pfizer comes out in the Fall."
2021-06-18 15:19:21,"It’s very simple: The J&J vaccine was less popular because it came out later than AND was less effective than even a single shot of Pfizer or Moderna. 

Then add to that the multiple issues with contamination and rare medical issues potentially related to the vaccine, and how could anyone expect it to be successful is beyond comprehension. 

The thing that really baffles me though, is that we’re trying to hoist this vaccine on vulnerable populations, both in this country and abroad. While there are some questions of access in certain locations, the fact that we’re not even having substantive discussions the communities we’re pushing this lesser vaccine on (which tend to be poorer and Blacker, here and abroad) leaves me understanding why there is still skepticism of the medical establishment in those communities. We need to do better and stop expecting those communities to simply settle for less."
2021-06-18 15:15:12,"I assume J&J is getting paid for every dose though. Our government does not seem to be able to refuse the big drug companies anything, including payment for shoddy work.

Did the government let the J&J lobbyists write the contracts like they do drug legislation?"
2021-06-18 15:20:04,"Dear NYT:

The Biden administration messed this up, period, and should be held accountable. 

First, the administration failed to supervise drug manufacturing at a Baltimore plant under federal contract, delaying rollout of the J&J vaccine, and later forcing J&J to throw out tens of millions of doses -- a PR debacle.

Second, the Biden administration flailed in its FDA review and approval process on the J&J vaccine, delaying its emergency approval.  

Third, the Biden administration was too eager to prove their anti-racist credentials -- putting wokeness over public health science -- and employed high profile, mass-vax stadium sites, instead of delivering it more effectively to disadvantaged communities via clinics, drug stores, mobile vans, etc.

Fourth, the messaging around J&J was terrible -- making it appear this excellent ""one and done"" vaccine was second rate.  And remember, before she was put in charge of fixing the r""oot causes"" of the border crisis, VP Harris was ""in charge"" of promoting vaccinations to people of color and other skeptics.  She was MIA.

Fifth, the FDA's ill-considered and poorly messaged ""pause"" on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine ""effectively kicked it aside for good.""

Now, after all this mismanagement, Biden is failing to make use of millions and millions of doses of J&J, while millions of Americans -- and billions of other humans -- sicken and die from this terrible scourge.  

This was a squandered opportunity."
2021-06-18 15:16:39,"I initially planned to get the J&J vaccine, because of the companies reputation and that only one shot was required. It didn't happen, and I ended up getting the two-dose Pfizer. I am so glad it worked out the way it did, especially after learning at the catastrophic problems in Baltimore.  What a reputation hit J&J, and the subcontractor (which was awarded a no-bid contract from a Trump crony) have taken. And many people profited from the situation, and should have the million they made clawed back. We'll see."
2021-06-18 15:03:14,The pause was ill-advised. I can't help but wonder why they paused on this but not on the new Alzheimer's drug.
2021-06-18 15:08:22,"There are winners and losers with vaccines and clearly J&J might have had advantages in certain areas it was inferior in very important ways.  Reality is that most people who are motivated to be vaccinated in the U.S. can get two shots outside of very unusual circumstances.  I get if this was rural India but reality is that rural areas in the U.S. aren't exactly difficult to reach places.  If another wave of the pandemic goes through certain areas, especially with the delta variant becoming common now, it is on those areas."
2021-06-18 15:22:12,"The over response ""pause"" in Abril had a devastating impact on the overall move towards getting vaccinated.  J&J will never be seen the same after that.  What a shame."

2021-06-18 15:11:06,"The problem I have with Johnson and Johnson is their credibility.  

The deaths of those women after getting the one  J&J shot IS tragic and will forever hover over many a memory.

But what also bothers me about J&J is the manufacturing production mishap at a factory in Baltimore which caused a two month shut because their subcontractor, Baltimore Emergent BioSolutions, ruined 15 million doses of the J&J vaccine because of multiple procedural failures, including unsanitary conditions near sensitive manufacturing areas.

There is enough concern and worry over these vaccinations from the very beginning without having issues like that one pop up from a subcontractor.

I tend to shy away from things that have caused great concern in the past.  I keep wondering, what else will go wrong with this company and their vaccination program?"
2021-06-18 15:13:38,"Turns out tanking its credibility at a time where skepticism was already high has a huge impact. The people who would actually draw the conclusion that ""they're pausing it because they want to make sure it is safe"" are not the ones who ever were going to need convincing.

2021-06-18 15:41:07,"If the USA doesn't want them, for God's sake send the vaccines to places in desperate need, such as Argentina and Peru. And here in Mexico too, we need to get everyone vaccinated before the inevitable arrival of the Delta variant."
2021-06-18 15:35:55,"This talk about J&J being less effective compared to the other two does not hold water. The first two vaccines were not evaluated in the countries that exhibited variants (i.e. South Africa and others). J&J was. Those of you thinking that Pfizer and Moderna were ""better"" are leaving that part out. The bottom line is that all the vaccines range from 90-100% efficacy in keeping a person from getting hospitalized or dying. That includes J&J. Read the studies. If you're uninformed, you will end up convincing someone that they shouldn't get a life saving vaccine."

personally i feel it would have done even more damage to those communities, the perception being that we pushed the worst of the vaccines on to our most vulnerable. this would have entrenched the mistrust in many of those communities. bullet dodged, i would think."
2021-06-18 15:58:20,"Scott Gottlieb said on CBS ""Face the Nation"" that the J&J vaccine is 60% effective against the Delta variant and the mRNA vaccines in two doses are 88% effective. In light of these differences, perhaps it isn't a bad thing that the mRNA vaccines are the dominant ones in the US."
2021-06-18 15:35:48,"Got it.  Works for me, or at least it works as well as anything else - not that anyone really knows until he/she gets sick.

Regardless of this issue, one can only hope that some lessons are being learned, e.g., when a pandemic looks to be arising, shut the borders down, period.  All people returning from outside the USA get escorted straight to areas (hotels, etc.) for quarantine/observation, and we go from there.

I say this as someone living just south of Cleveland, OH, where the maps show a massive influx of infection right around the time all the Universities in the region (more than a few) recalled all the students, who flew home, debarked, and were told to ""socially distance"" themselves.

We now know how well it works to ask people to do the right thing (and of course, this is after coming into contact with numerous airline personnel, other travelers, and so forth).

I took the first available (J&J) but wonder if I should have held out for the moderna or pfizer.  And I want to know if there is going to be a booster available for those who got the J&J vaccine to make it as effective as the others?
2021-06-18 16:01:23,Its unclear what the long term effect of all these vaccines will be..short term studies are not predictive of long term outcomes. The JnJ vax uses a technology that has been used for other vaxs and has a much lower efficacy rate but we have data from decades of use for small pox and polio. The new technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaxs has a much higher efficacy rate but no long term data. It may be that the JnJ vax may be safer in the long term than the new tch vaxs.
2021-06-18 16:06:09,J&J used to be revered as a company with high standards and ethics. They really dropped the football on their Covid vaccine. This has got to be a big hit to their reputation.

2021-06-18 16:19:04,"Vaccines were always going to be an uphill battle in some communities, but the media frenzy around the 8 people who developed blood clots is precisely when American enthusiasm around vaccines plummeted.

2021-06-18 16:15:35,"There is clearly someone to blame here, and it probably isn't Johnson and Johnson.  It's Emergent Biosolutions.

The problems described are due to a major shortage of the J&J vaccine which stem from the well described major manufacturing problems at Emergent.

J&J can be faulted for subcontracting to Emergent in the first place, but there weren't many alternatives, especially on American shores, given the outsourcing of American manufacturing and closure of American factories that has taken place over the past several decades.  About 90% of the medicines used in the US, and their key ingredients, are made abroad, mostly in China, and also India.  This has left us very vulnerable.

But there are American plants, and it's worth asking how Emergent could have done such a bad job.  They're practically next door to the FDA.  In the past, Emergent's main business was making vaccines for the US government.  Was there any government oversight, or were the Feds asleep at the wheel?

I don't think the lion's share of the blame can reasonably be placed on J & J.  The truth is the country and the world very much need their expertise. We need more vaccines, and we need drugs to treat Covid.  J &J does need to do a better job of supervising their subcontractors.

Drugs and vaccines require big pharma to develop, test, and manufacture. If we allow American trial lawyers to bankrupt companies like J&J, we will all pay a high price when there is no one to  make the drugs and vaccines we need."
2021-06-18 16:20:08,"It's a little disingenuous to compare one-shot to two-shot vaccines on the basis of doses administered. The real question is how many people are vaccinated with this one versus another one - and where this is discussed near the bottom (1 in 12, roughly eight percent of those partially or fully vaccinated against COVID-19) it's done disparagingly. The authors seem interested in convincing the reading public that they share the take that this vaccine is not just less popular but less worthy. (It is certainly less available.) The US is better positioned that almost anywhere in the world, vaccine wise. Publicly espousing attitudes that clearly lead to more vaccine doses expiring unused is a waste - literally - and a shame.

Meanwhile those who have had the Janssen vaccine are itching for data about its prevention of illness and transmissibility in real world conditions. Pfizer seems a lot better about funding its own studies, as are countries which have national health programs (and are able to compare vaccines (but none of these have a Janssen-vaccinated population subset to compare).

One might imagine that a dose of Janssen with a booster of an mRNA vaccine might offer the best possible protection of any two-shot combo, but few cross-manufacturer studies have even started and none yet offer this (a Moderna booster study will start soon, I think). Data about other vaccines' efficacy against the infiltrating Delta variant is starting to trickle in. A little more speed is wanted."
2021-06-18 16:21:56,Not surprising. You get what you pay for. A magic one-shot vaccination that doesn’t need the preservation techniques the very effective ones do? Troubles and hiccups with manufacturing? I also wonder the long-term efficacy of J&J vs Moderna etc. There will be more to this story …
2021-06-18 16:06:23,"Whatever excess vaccines we have -- J&J, Pfizer, Moderna, and our not-yet-approved but stockpiled Astra-Zeneca -- should be donated to COVAX immediately. There's no excuse for vaccines being left to expire.

One thing missing from the assessment of effectiveness: In clinical trials, only experimental-group volunteers are vaccinated; the rest of the population isn't. The difference between 75% and 90% effectiveness is going to dwindle as a population approaches herd immunity, simply because there will be fewer people transmitting the disease."

2021-06-18 16:43:18,"Something like half of the new drugs advertised on TV give a laundry list of severe side effects ending in a phrase like ""in rare instances it can cause death."" The J&J vaccine has been blamed for 1 death in over 10 million administrations world-wide, yet the media frenzy, Trumpista conspiracist and anti-vaxxer hysteria have led the news cycles for weeks. Between 39,000 and 40,000 Americans die in auto accidents each year.  In Florida, where I live, auto deaths are over 1,500 a year per that same 10 million figure (Texas leads the numbers with California second, BTW), yet we think nothing of getting in our cars daily.

Are we innumerate (numerically illiterate) or just overall stupid?"
2021-06-18 16:44:11,"Coverage of the J&J vaccine in the popular press has been so sensationalist and misleading that Americans who form misguided ""opinions"" can almost be forgiven for ending being associated with science-deniers.

If you picked an American at random in Jan 2020, there would be about a 1 in 550 chance that today they would be dead of Covid.  If a vaccine has a fatal reaction rate of 1 in 11,000* you are still 200X safer taking the vaccine.

Science! ... every ... single ... time.

*Which is 100X higher than any of them do!"

2021-06-18 16:45:26,Corporate arrogance. Emergent Biosystem's management should be removed if the company wishes to retain government contracts. JNJ bears responsibility for not riding herd on Emergent. I can recall the CEO of JNJ boasting on TV over a year ago how the company could quickly produce hundreds of millions of doses. Given JNJ's stellar reputation there were few doubters. Who knew that the company had contracted out the manufacturing. A massive failure.
2021-06-18 17:17:09,"People don't want a less effective and more dangerous vaccine when there are much better alternatives available?  I'm shocked.

I guess people can figure out how to come back for a second shot after all."
2021-06-18 17:18:14,"If J&J vaccine really turns to have serious common side effects and it is primarily used to “address health disparities,” the backlash would be even more serious.   What little trust there is will be completely gone. It’s not “addressing health disparities” until everybody has access to the same. But let’s face it - everybody likes equality only as long as it fits their own self-interest. It’s not incidental that Pfizer and Moderna aren’t going around equally."
2021-06-18 16:58:24,"Are we really that surprised on how people distrust J&J vaccine? And opt for a more reliable vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna). This is a PR nightmare for the company. Not to mention they had a history of contaminating one of their products, e.g., talc based baby powder (w/ asbestos particles) is associated with cancer; they’re still appealing on the $2 billion lawsuit case. Like any biotech company, J&J CEO still wants to make profit and keeps a positive outlook that people will use their one shot vaccine."
2021-06-18 17:03:09,No surprise. I knew that pause w/ J&J was going to put a dent in the rollout.
2021-06-18 17:08:16,"They never should have suspended it’s use for what amounted to an infinitesimal risk factor that wasn’t and hasn’t even been proven to be causal, and even if causal is a non-factor when compared to the risk of not being vaccinated.

I blame the media for freaking out and over reporting with angst the issue without context or facts."

2021-06-18 17:05:33,"I do not see the J & J vaccine as a failure or lacking.  It did have problems to overcome.  Here (USA) we have options, very good ones, that the government is paying for.  The true reach of the J & J vaccine will always be outside of the industrial world, who can afford Pfizer and Moderna vaccines with their super stringent storage methods. 

Pfizer and Moderna may stop the pandemic here, but the J & J vaccine has a good shot to save the world."
2021-06-18 17:29:43,"I'm nearing 70 and have been temporarily disabled from an accident since February.  Early on, b/c of my age, I was offered my choice of the vaccines by my local department of public health, but they required that I appear in person.  I explained in a note about my immobility, and two months later the DPH contacted me and said they could send a vehicle to my residence for an in-person vaccination, but J&J was the only option.  Did I want it?  I couldn't say yes fast enough.  If I had held out for either Pfizer or Moderna, I'd still be waiting, and it could be a couple more months before I could physically manage to go to one of the sites.  So I'm grateful both to J&J and the DPH."
2021-06-18 17:20:54,"Who are these ""experts""?  What missed ""game changer""?

From what I see, whether Pfizer, Moderna or J&J, we have more vaccines than we have people remaining who are willing to get a shot(s).

We're either giving it away to other countries both needy and not (yes, you Canada) or else shelf lives are reaching expiration dates.

There's no missed opportunity here.  There are literally millions of idiots in this country who aren't willing to protect themselves and those around them.

We may be able to prevent Covid infection.  We cannot cure stupidity!

Enough of shaming people.  Because that is exactly what the tone of articles like this is trying to do.  

It is insulting particularly seniors like myself who spent hours on-line in the early days desperately trying to get a vaccine appointment ""back in the day""!"
2021-06-18 17:35:28,"It’s almost as though shelving it for nonsensical health concerns scared people off. That was a comically incompetent move by the CDC.

Also, at what point will the government stop paying for unvaccinated people’s COVID health care?"
2021-06-18 17:24:09,"My sister, a school teacher, got the J&J vaccine. She now feels cheated. School teachers are exposed to nearly every virus and variant that passes through, so they typically want the best protection available.

The J&J vaccine is better than nothing, but for those of us that take the virus seriously, it's clearly not the best.

We were told when the J&J vaccine first appeared and we were all desperate to be vaccinated, that we could follow up the J&J with one of the others.  I.e. one dose of J&J and one of Moderna.  We never hear that anymore.  I wonder why."
2021-06-18 17:34:52,"“It’s just not what I think anybody would have hoped it would be when it came out,” said Dave Baden, the chief financial officer of the Oregon Health Authority.

Well, this goes a long way toward explaining the problem and its cause. The J&J vaccine is, of course, medically exactly what it was supposed to be. The incompetent handling of the early stages of the so-called ""clotting controversy"" by healthcare administrators destroyed the vaccine's acceptance. We are now in the sorry situation of many doses of an effective vaccine expiring on the shelf while people continue to die of the covid virus."
2021-06-18 17:36:15,"The ""Lord can work in mysterious ways"" and sometimes this seems to be true. First, there were all the pandemic doubters and deniers ,who were primarily Trump supporters, believing his intentional misinformation-- that Woodward reported from  Feb 7, 2020. Then low and behold, Trump and family all catch Covid 19 contradicting his optional  mask theory and denial of the pandemic. Second, we are forced to pause the J and J vaccine because of the concerns for blood clots with J and J and Astra Zeneca. This turns out to be fortuitous.  Unfortunately, J and J has proven to be a failure compared to the mRNA vaccines of Moderna and Pfizer. Initially, I  was willing to recommend all 3 of the approved vaccines in my primary care practice. However, I sadly must report J and J is inferior in achieving antibody responses compared to the mRNA vaccines and I would strongly recommend not using it--unless you have no other options."
2021-06-18 17:47:47,Almost never mentioned is that the effectiveness of all of these vaccines is the high percentage if you own body creates lots of antibodies from the vaccine.  Older people will not get that 88% protection:  the vaccine is still critical but they are not getting 88% protection.   Rarely said in the media.
2021-06-18 17:46:19,How about some reporting on what J&J is doing with regard to a booster shot?  What happens to those of us that had the J&J shot?
2021-06-18 17:49:38,So I love the JnJ vaccine. Every single person in my orbit got Covid.. kids.. grandparents.. staff.. uncle aunts... expect me and wife. Only ones vaccinated at that time thanks to JnJ
2021-06-18 17:50:14,What a dumb country!
2021-06-18 17:50:43,"Interesting.  The constant hammering by the right wing has told us that government can not do anything right and that private enterprise is the only way.

Having worked for many companies and seen lots of waste and stupidity I long ago came to the conclusion that the message from the right is not true.

Look at this company, look at Astra Zeneca and that mess they made with that vaccine.

If this is private enterprise getting it right then sign me up for some government."
2021-06-18 17:50:17,Give the excess vaccine doses to India and other countries. They are better than the Chinese vaccines.
2021-06-18 17:46:09,"In addition to a lack of trust in corporations and government oversight entities, like the FDA and CDC, that became corrupt and incompetent under Trump, I think decades of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical TV and print advertising have largely contributed to average Americans believing that they know as much or more than experts. Corrupt industries who own American policies plus over-saturated marketing to consumers equals a breakdown of the systems meant to protect society."
2021-06-18 18:57:28,"Reading some of the comments here, it seems that people believe that only “troubled” or poor nations are short of vaccines. 

That is incorrect. 

There are many wealthy countries who are willing and quite able to pay, who cannot get their hands on vaccines. There is a global shortage.

And what we see is the US sitting on tens of millions of vaccines -this needs to be emphasized- TENS OF MILLIONS of vaccines, which it will neither donate nor sell. 

In the meantime, countries like China and India have been donating and selling vaccines for months. Shipments from these countries are arriving regularly. The absence of US support is noted.

It would be nice if the US would donate some vaccines to countries that can’t afford to buy. 

But since the US is not doing that, can the US  at least SELL to the countries that can afford it?"
2021-06-18 19:26:45,"A disclaimer: I'm not an expert on the testing that has been done regarding the vaccines.  The following is my limited understanding.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were tested in two dose regimens; I don't believe there have been large, formal one-shot regimen tests of these vaccines, though we do have some data.  The J&J vaccine was tested in a one dose regimen, and I don't believe it has been tested in a formal two dose trial.

I don't think there have been trials comparing a two-dose regimen of Pfizer/Moderna with a two-shot regimen of J&J, and I don't think there have been trials comparing one shot regimens of both vaccines. 

The data does show that one shot of the J&J vaccine is effective, but not as effective as a two-shot regimen of Moderna/Pfizer.

All three vaccines are effective in reducing the risk of Covid, and in mitigating the severity when the disease ""breaks through"" in a vaccinated individual."
2021-06-18 19:31:40,"Hard to grasp how doubtful many people are about science and how little most people understand about scientific facts, how misinformation has tainted people’s ability to think clearly -scientifically - rather than guessing and speculating. Because no matter what, getting a vaccine - any COVID vaccine - is better than no vaccine at all. J&J’s is an excellent vaccine. What a gift to humanity, what a feat these scientists have achieved in such little time, it’s awe inspiring. These should be the headlines and people should be grateful for vaccines and understand that our only chance - the only one, there is no other - of getting a normal life back are vaccines. If I would be in charge which regrettably I’m not I would make vaccination MANDATORY. Everyone must get vaccinated, no exceptions."
2021-06-18 20:25:35,"My daughter got the J&J vaccine because her doctor felt that the side effects of the two-dose shots would put her in the hospital.  Since the J&J vaccine is  similar to the flu vaccines she gets yearly without problems, the doctor felt it would be tolerated better.  And yes, a few vulnerable people have indeed needed hospitalization from the 2-dose vaccines.
To be clear: my spouse and I both got the Moderna shots and are very happy we did so.  We're also very happy that our daughter was able to get some sort of vaccine that was safe for her."
2021-06-18 20:28:41,"The only reason why the J&J vaccine is supposed to be a one-dose vaccine  is because it is based on Ad26, which means that any second dose would not be effective anyway, because the immunized individual would have developed antibodies to the Ad26 itself, which would prevent any meaningful response during a booster shot.  

I have worked with recombinant adenoviruses for gene transfer applications for almost 30 years and that is exactly what happens in animal models.  Already 2 weeks after the initial shot, the subsequent application of the same virus would lose effectiveness and after 4 weeks it will no longer do anything. 

There is no way to effectively boost with the J&J vaccine except by changing the serotype of the virus.  The same will likely also be true for the AstraZeneca virus.   The first shot does the job, the second shot is almost a placebo."
2021-06-18 19:47:13,"Well I just managed to get the very last J&J dose in town (microchip now transmitting;)

I have no adverse reactions, it's one & done, & it's not genetically modified like the RNA vaccines, which though brilliant & fascinating, is a bit new for my taste (not that this should discourage anyone, I'd have done any of the options if J&J weren't available), if in fact there's a more traditional option, which there is!

Hopefully this option will return to popularity. I'm really glad to be vaccinated against this horror, & grateful to all the researchers who made it happen so fast.

But seriously, I've never heard such a collection of hokum like some of the stuff these anti-vax people are proclaiming with utter certitude.

I have neighbors who are sure that vaccinated people are transmitting blood-clots to the un-vaxxed (through the air?), & 
that the Covid vaccine is causing early menstruation in girls, so these people won't let their 16-year-old get her learners permit or leave the house because of these things.

So much of the anti-vax/anti-mask/anti-distancing conspiracy theories were propagated by the Trumpist obsession with Covid-denialism, because Covid interfered w/the myth of the 'Trump Economy', interrupting what they saw as the surefire path to total Trump dominion & the end of the US constitution in favor of a white-supremacist caliphate.

For this lunacy, the USA became one of the worst Covid outbreaks on earth. Charge Trump with Criminally-Negligent Genocide."
2021-06-18 18:39:01,"If get another breakout of the virus this Fall, a lot of the critics will be out words, my Mom, Dad and myself were vaccinated in March with the JnJ vaccine and we feel fine, perhaps the fact that Dad is a retired marketing guy from a big pharma company help us understand not just the virus but the vaccine process, as a naturalized US citizen, I can't believe the level of ignorance among the people on health topics,  it's really sad how Americans are brainwashed so easily."
2021-06-18 18:19:34,"With new information appearing every day about rampant corruption in the Trump administration, I can't help wondering if it's laissez-faire largesse to Johnson & Johnson wasn't connected to Trump's coziness with Robert Wood (""Woody"") Johnson IV, a great-grandson of the founder of Johnson & Johnson.

Trump chose ""Woody"" to be the U.S. Ambassador to the U.K, His complete lack of diplomatic experience was overlooked, perhaps because of his generous donations to Trump World:

By August 2019 'Woody"" had donated $1.5 million to Trump's campaign and inaugural committee. 

In February 2020 'Woody"" gave $575,000 to a fundraising committee for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign and $355,000 to the RNC.

 In May 2020 ""Woody""  gave $1 million to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC."
2021-06-18 20:03:30,"Big Pharma demonstrated clearly that mass quantity production was beyond its capability, as did federal and state government in distribution and vaccine delivery to individuals across the country.

The J&J outcome is a very sad one for a world renowned Pharma leader over many years, now having lost its reputation on subcontractor failure.

Hopefully the whole throughput process will be amended by White House intervention."
2021-06-18 18:24:55,"The J&J vaccine was from beginning less effective than the two previously approved vaccines, even if it was reasonably effective, but that was glossed over if not outright lied about (""every bit as effective as ...""). There was also this worrying drumbeat on how this is the vaccine that minorities and the underserved ""could"" now take, as if a slightly less effective vaccine was just what the doctor ordered for members of those groups, and it was just too darn much trouble, for them and the authorities alike, to give them two shots of the more effective vaccines. Then came the production problems  ..."
2021-06-18 20:17:48,It is pointless to discuss J&J vaccine fate in USA. This vaccine would be the perfect vaccine in the developing world so I wonder why there is no push from J&J corporation?
2021-06-18 19:18:40,"So the Media interrupted the J&J rollout with overhype of reactions that were statistically zero and now declare it a failure. Typical. I don't see them raising the same alarm with the heart inflammation reactions from the other vaccines. Why is that? In my own case it just came down to scheduling. I wanted the J&J, but couldn't make that appointment. Three days later I got the Moderna. Why isn't the media pushing distribution of these vaccines to neighboring countries that need them?"
2021-06-18 20:21:30,I wanted the J&J vaccine in my area (southern CA) but was told the people in charge in my state or county had relegated it to a certain population e.g. homeless people or indigent people who were unlikely to keep a second appointment so its purported failure has to do with what states opted to do as well.
2021-06-18 18:14:04,"Could the issue be that the government stopped the use of J&J for several weeks and tarnished its image unnecessarily?

But why does anyone care which vaccine people choose?  In California, I had one choice at the time and it was J&J.  So I took it because I am a rational person.  If ""today's special"" had been one of the others, I would have taken it instead."
2021-06-18 18:43:27,Any vaccine that is about to expire should be given to a country that demonstrates it needs the vaccine and can use it right away.
2021-06-18 20:26:48,"Better to get Pfizer anyway. Be grateful that we have even one vaccine this quickly, and fingers crossed that the vax and possible booster(s) will defeat the variants."
2021-06-18 17:58:33,"The pause of the J&J vaccine was inhumane. This country is often so bad at grasping the concept of statistical anomalies to such an extent, that a bad but extremely rare side effect from something that is in most circumstances beneficial to ones health were scrutinized, yet there are statistically common health issues that arise from things like excessive pollution that go unscrutinized simply in the name of freedom and because it isn't a news story to say such and such factory causes more cancer than you can ever imagine, because it happens everyday. If people can choose to smoke cigarettes where there are no health benefits and substantial risks, people should be allowed to choose to get a vaccine with health benefits and possible extremely rare dangerous side effects."
2021-06-18 19:08:45,I'm curious to hear more about the vaccine mixing studies.  Specifically a JnJ with an mRna booster. I thought there was promising theories of mixing viral vector with mRna than solely mRna.
2021-06-18 18:50:11,"The real problem with the J&J vaccine is its 72% efficacy vs 95% for Pfizer and Moderna.  Yes, I know the argument that it will keep you from dying or going to the ICU.  But evidence is mounting that people with mild or no symptoms are having long-term problems.

My wife is a psychologist, and she has two clients that are struggling with ""brain fog"" a year after they contracted COVID with mild symptoms.

You're welcome to take J&J if you wish, but I'm very glad I got two shots of Pfizer."
2021-06-18 20:42:55,"I think tHe federal government should recoup the money it paid to Johnson and Johnson and especially Emergent. In my opinion, very little worked out as planned or promised."
2021-06-18 19:22:56,"I want to know whether J & J and Emergent will have to give back some of the taxpayer money they took to develop these vaccines.   J&J has had quality issues since it started laying of it's old workers in 2008 and hiring contractors. How the sort of mix up could occur at Emergent is impossible to imagine, for anyone who has done pharmaceutical manufacturing. To see these vaccines go to waste is terrible, they should be sent to poor countries.  Vaccinate Guatemala. At the end of this though, there should be some serious consequences for the companies that took the money."
2021-06-18 19:43:38,"I got the J&J vaccine. Although not as good as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, it still has a very high efficacy rate. Smallpox was eradicated with a vaccine that has an even lower efficacy rate than the J&J vaccine. It's just that Pfizer and Moderna have exceptionally high efficacy rates."
2021-06-18 19:31:27,"My girlfriend and I both got J&J. Both of us chose J&J because we wanted to get this whole thing over with and move on. We also felt that the blood clot risk was negligible and mostly just a hyped media thing. However, the thing that I think truly kills the J&J vaccines success is the day-after side effects. 

It's not very advertised, but if you are a decently young person, the J&J vaccine will kick your butt for about 36 hours after. You simply cannot do anything but lay in bed and take it. You can treat with over the counter but it's brutal.

This reality has gotten around and a lot of people prefer the two shotters because the recovery is lighter for both shots and you don't have to take a day or possibly multiple days off work to recover.

that's just my experience. But, I'm thankful for the J&J. I have a huge fear of needles and being over with this quickly sure was nice."
2021-06-18 18:58:43,"I’d remember back to the Great Ebola Scare. The same kinds of fears, anxieties, warped realities, outright lies, and outright lies told for politiical purposes, are around today.

Some of the political comments I’m seeing from lefties are pretty maddening, I have to say. You wanna be mad about the ways we handle (or likely don’t) medicine for people of color and the poor? Good, you should. 

But be mad at the food inequities that leave them more vulnerable. Be mad at the lack of health care facilities and docs where they live. Be mad at the morons who constantly attack Medicaid, CHIP, food programs, Planned Parenthood, UNESCO and so on. Be mad at the incoherent and warlike and corrupt governments in joints like Tanzania and Venezuela. Be mad and the ao-and-sos who spread anti-vaxxer lies. 

Heck, you wanna be outraged? Go after the crummy electrical systems and the lack of refrigeration. Go after the way China and India have played vaccine diplomat. 

These adenovirus vector vaccines—J&J, AZ, Sputnik—were designed to be much cheaper, to need less refrigeration. To be good—and they are—to be very safe (and they are) and to be better accessed by the people who were already most at risk. 

Yelling at them is stupid."
2021-06-18 20:12:26,"It’s quite telling that countries like India, China were or are producing vaccines, willing to distribute to other countries after their own population get vaccinated (including to developed countries like Australia or NZ), while idiots here in the US are willing to get affected by Covid rather than get s dose of vaccine.

To all the Trump supporters crediting Warp Speed for vaccines in the U.S.:
- Pfizer was produced in Germany & reflects the work of 2 Turkish immigrants (Trump/Republicans hate immigrants, especially from Muslim countries)
- Astrozeneca was produced in the U.K.
- Moderna was already in the works
- Trump spend 2 months pouting on the golf course after he lost the election and left no vaccine pipeline AND Republicans obstructed the transition and allowed members of the Trump admin not to cooperate in a peaceful transfer of power, leaving Biden's team to scramble to buy and distribute vaccines, delaying deployment for at least a month
- And recently, Republicans, including my senator, Marsha Blackburn, have participated in a bogus campaign orchestrated by Tucker Carlson to get Anthony Fauci fired.

It may have saved my life because 2 weeks after my shot my daughter got Covid and we were together in close quarters during that time, indoors, and maskless (she had had a negative antigen test the day before we got together).

The J&J vaccine got clobbered because the reporting by the press painted a false picture of its effectiveness.  Story after story said J&J was only 60% effective vs Pfizer/Moderna at over 90% — a false comparison because J&J tested in different population groups abroad.  There were zero Covid fatalities and zero Covid hospitalizations for serious illness in the 45,000-person J&J trial.  this vaccine is highly effective against all known variants.  

The FDA had no business suspending the J&J vaccine, which was poison icing on the cake.  This is a true tragidy because the J&J vaccine is cheaper to produce, can be stored with regular refrigeration, and only requires one dose.

2021-06-18 21:18:36,"What privilege we have here in the US that people are actually choosing which vaccine to get or choosing to not get vaccinated at all while millions of people in the rest of the world cannot get vaccines and tens of thousands keep dying.  Send the doses to countries that are in desperate needs and want them, now, before they expire. Maybe some good can come out of this."
2021-06-18 21:49:39,"Long haul COVID is a problem. It affects even people with mild and asymptomatic infections. Chronic fatigue, organ damage, brain fog, loss of taste and/or smell, etc. are not things to take lightly. So the difference in efficacy rates is like playing Russian Roulette. And against the Delta variant the J&J drops to 60% vs 88% for the two-shot ones per Andy Slavitt (stated that on radio show yesterday - KQED Forum).

At the beginning, when the goal was merely to prevent hospitalization and death it sounded ok - a mild or moderate infection was just supposed to go away and you would be fine. But once it became clear that long haul was going to become its own healthcare crisis, it’s not a good situation. I think they need to study how to boost the J&J people NOW, with the Delta variant being dominant. Delta can cause more severe infection that the original strain, and we J&J-ers are 28% less protected. 

It IS an issue."
2021-06-18 18:27:16,"Another concern about the JNJ is its lower efficacy in preventing mild-moderate infections compared to the others. While initially only death and hospitalization were issues, new research shows that mild-moderate and even infections with no symptoms can result equally with severe infections when it comes to long COVID. There are now reports of people with no symptoms initially coming down with odd symptoms months later too."
2021-06-18 23:11:46,"Multiple real world data are coming out showing that the very high effectiveness numbers of the mRNA vaccines hold up against variants, including the Delta variant. The most recent study from the UK shows the mRNA vaccines to be 88% effective against symptomatic COVID caused by the Delta variant. Compared to that, the Astra Zeneca vaccine, which is the same technology as Janssen but in two doses, was about 64% effective. That's a meaningful difference in a large scale study. 

People may well say that all vaccines protect against hospitalization and death, but given a choice, I'm going to take the one that also protects against milder forms of the disease. 

We need to stop repeating the mantra that all vaccines are equal in the face of data to the contrary, and especially given the likelihood of increasingly dangerous variants over time. This amounts to  disseminating false information and preventing people from making informed choices."
2021-06-18 21:30:13,I proudly got the J&J. The travesty in it all is that the pause and less than tidy manufacturing hygiene in Baltimore was only part of it's current downfall. The media was the other problem. They blew up the pause even though it was only a minute number of people getting blood clots. Same with AZ over in Europe.

""The Delta variant currently makes up between six and 10 percent of cases in the United States, said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, adding that it will probably will be the dominant strain in the United States by August.

If you are fully vaccinated, particularly with a two-dose vaccine, “don’t worry about the Delta variant,” Dr. Jha said.

Millions of Americans have received either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines; both are two-dose vaccines. Studies have shown their efficacy drops only slightly when encountering variants.

“People who have been vaccinated still do quite well against this variant,” Dr. Jha said, “but it is one where you need a high degree of immunity to ward off, so you really need to have both of your doses of your vaccine.”

And if you have the J&J vaccine?  The one dose vaccine?  Very obviously, you don't matter.  Thanks, Dr. Jha."

2021-06-19 00:19:04,"It is all turning out to be a lot more difficult than anticipated with variants, long-haul infections and logistical distribution problems; but don't forget that the USA has done a comparatively good job under Biden. That is as compared to other countries.
It does not help that the Murdoch propaganda machine for profit has sewn confusion and bad faith disinformation with a public health calamity.
The crazy right has played games with the health and longevity of Americans. Rupert made sure he was sequestered from risk and fully vaccinated. Apologies from Australia- you should be more careful whom you allow to immigrate."

What’s also a shame, is that we are the envy of the planet with vaccine resources aplenty, while the rest of the world mostly stumbles or waits for its opportunity.  Millions of (spoiled) Americans gaming for the “right” vaccine, when any (applied in sufficient) will drastically slow the spread of disease.  Millions of others “protesting” by exercising their right to not get a vaccine or depend on the good citizenship of others to be their virus shield.

I jumped at my opportunity to protect myself, my family, and my fellow citizens.  That is patriotism.  Wasting millions of doses is not, and just tells the world we’re spoiled and ignorant."
2021-06-26 17:18:52,"First, kudos to Kelly Danielpour for starting VaxTeen.org

Second, requiring consent of both parents is horrible given the politicization of the issue by the Trump administration et al.

Third, requiring consent of one parent is troublesome, for the reason above--politicization of the issue.

Teens want to feel safe, and they are much much safer if they get vaccinated.

Take a look at what is going on in Bogota.  Horrible.  People of all ages dying of Covid-19; healthcare system is collapsed.  Teens can read about this in the newspaper, and then to be denied a vaccination?  

It is really important to back off of politicizing pandemic issues and just get to the task:  do what is possible to protect people; and people should do what is possible to protect themselves and others around them."

2021-06-26 17:52:05,"There are times a kid's got to do what a kid's got to do. This comes up often in abuse situations where the child calls police or tells a friend or neighbor what is going on in order to restore safety. As far as I'm concerned, if protecting your very life means giving irrational parents the runaround, then a kid's got to do it."
2021-06-26 18:05:32,"I hate to think how these relatively young parents would have handled the Polio vaccines. Lots of dead children, I suspect."
2021-06-26 18:11:08,"It is a travesty that teens are barred from making this common-sense health care decision. Many teens are better informed than their parents, have researched the question and have decided to make the choice that almost every doctor is urging them to make. If a teen can explain to a doctor why they want to be vaccinated, they should be allowed to be vaccinated. End of story. Parents who prevent their kid from following mainstream medical advice are neglecting their kids' heath."
2021-06-26 18:17:30,"There is a legal issue which is not mentioned in this article.  When you get a flu shot you have to sign a long paper that lists all possible adverse events and acknowledges that you are aware of them and still want the vaccine and that you are holding harmless those who are administering the vaccine.  They won't give it to you if you don't sign.  If a minor receives a flu shot, a parent or legal guardian must sign on their behalf.  My younger son got a shot two weeks before his 18th birthday, and I still had to sign.  The next year I *couldn't* sign for him as I had no legal authority to do so.

I had to sign a similar waiver for me to get the Covid vaccine. 
Wouldn't someone administering a Covid shot be concerned about the legal inability of a minor r to sign such a release? And if the parents actually opposed it, the legal issues would be further magnified as what would keep the parents from suing in the event of an adverse event?"
2021-06-26 18:27:19,"It's not just the COVID shot that parents are refusing. I'm seeing the same thing with the HPV vaccine in my pediatric practice. Unvaccinated teens who are asking to be vaccinated. The kids want these vaccines.

2021-06-26 18:27:38,"My kid has a close friend ('Rory') who is the 17 year old daughter of two educated, affluent anti-vaxxers. Rory wants the Covid vaccine so she can go back to school in the fall and be with her friends. It's an ongoing battle with her parents, one of whom suffers from severe asthma but still won't get vaccinated. It's distressing to hear this kid express her frustration."
2021-06-26 18:37:49,"Age: 63. No children.
  I've held off saying this for decades but here goes; many parents are wrapped up in really un-healthy, anti-social psychologies concerning their kids. Unwilling to let go. Unwilling to admit that their kids are growing up and that they, the parent, are growing older. It's a form of child abuse.
  Some parents so over-value their children that the thought of any harm drives them literally mad. And I don't mean unhappiness, I mean physical harm. A skinned knee, a bump on the head. G-d forbid she should get bit by a dog. 
  The parent is willing to cause all manner of unhappiness, anxiety and heart-break, as long as the kid doesn't get dinged. This, despite the fact that uncountable previous generations of kids got ourselves knocked around regularly, with no apparent harm done. Some of us still have the (barely visible) scars from silly things we did before the Beatles even got together.
  So I applaud those teenagers who blind-side their parents and wrong-foot the authorities to get the vaccine if they want it."
2021-06-26 18:40:02,Nearly 180 million people vaccinated and adverse reactions from vaccine are vanishingly small in number.  I hope Elizabeth's father isn't helping her with math homework.
2021-06-26 18:48:17,"To Elizabeth, who is caught between her high school's vaccination requirement for fall attendance, her father's refusal and spat with administrators, her considered decision to quietly get vaccinated, her fear of her father suing her mother for consenting, and her worries about a taint on her college prospects:

You did not deceive the vaccinators. The school nurse whom you consulted out of diligence may have been misinformed. The onus for acceptance of your consent form was not with the school nurse, but with the vaccinators. Whether the form was flawed or incorrectly accepted is not your responsibility. Your honestly signed form was accepted by clinicians whose job it was to interpret it. 

Your father won't get far suing your mother for consenting to a vaccine urged for your age group by infectious disease and pediatric specialists. Notwithstanding its proven effectiveness against a deadly disease, your father is entitled to his opinion of the vaccine. He is not entitled, however, to overrule your mother. Any lawyer who files his nuisance suit will pocket an up-front fee and deliver nothing. Your father, meanwhile, will discover your agency as a person. It's time. 

As for colleges, you will wow every prospect with an admissions essay on navigating this welter of conflicting risks, loyalties and costs. I can't imagine a better coming-of-age story, or one more predictive of excellence in college, career and all of  life. Best wishes and carry on."
2021-06-26 19:01:52,"Maybe parents denying covid vaccinations to their teenagers for no solid reason should be declared ""temporarily incompetent."" 

What is really worrisome is if the parents are refusing to allow their teenagers to get vaccinated for covid for political reasons, such as they believe and support or want to demonstrate their allegiance to Trump. This could be determined by asking 2 questions:

1. Did Joseph Biden win the presidency in the 2020 election?
  
2. Did Donald J. Trump win the presidency in the 2020 election?  

If the parent answers ""no"" to question 1, but ""yes"" to question 2, then the parent is declared temporarily incompetent to make covid vaccination decisions for the children. 

Okay, I am not serious, but having taught in the health care fields for decades, it is not unusual to see children and adolescents who are far more reasonable and rational than their parents when it comes to health and medical decisions. 

More importantly, when it comes to competence: the fallout and damage are staggering from Donald J. Trump's lies, misinformation, and mishandling of his duties as president--no better demonstrated than his mishandling of the covid pandemic. 

Trump is the one who is not ""competent"" to make decisions for anyone, much less an entire country and the planet."
2021-06-26 19:10:11,"This is child neglect, if not abuse. Unconscionable."
2021-06-26 19:17:39,The children should notify their local child protection departments. Parents that refuse to let their children get vaccinated are jeopardizing their lives.
2021-06-26 19:34:56,"Where did this notion that you have the right to risk everyone else life come from? 

The only people who have the right to say no to an immunization are those medically unable to take one safely. 

Everyone else is obligated to everyone else to get immunized."
2021-06-26 19:35:19,"This reminds me of what was going on a few decades ago - when places like Planned Parenthood and women's health clinics would provide free screening and birth control to minor teenagers without their parents' knowledge or consent -  

The reasoning being that it was preferable to have healthy young people practicing safe sex - rather than a population of pregnant teens infected with an STD --

I applaud the clinics which are providing the vaccinations to these smart and very away teens..."
2021-06-26 19:36:17,"COVID shots were my sons' ""get out of jail free"" cards.  They are now back to normal teenage lives -friends, in-person summer school, summer jobs - and so happy after 15 months of miserable isolation.  I cannot fathom why anyone would deny vaccination to their kids."
2021-06-26 19:36:32,After 23 years of teaching I became convinced that the biggest problem in teenagers lives is their parents.  The second biggest problem is their friends.  The next biggest problem is their teachers.  The next biggest problem is the other kids that bully them.  For high school seniors many of them have the problem of choosing a college or how they are going to pay for college or what they are going to do after high school.  In short being a teenager really stinks in this society.  This article is another example of how that is true.
2021-06-26 19:39:02,Hopefully Elizabeth only has one more year of shared custody. Good for her for sneaking down the alley for a vaccination.
2021-06-26 19:41:20,What is wrong with people? When did we start letting gossip trump science and common sense? These parents should have their children taken away for neglect.
2021-06-26 19:42:57,It's far worse than this article states.  There are teens being threatened with being thrown out of the house and made homeless if they get the covid vaccine.  There are parents who are threatening to stop their teen from going to college if they get the covid shot.  The vaccine misinformation out there is doing huge damage to many people's lives.
2021-06-26 19:44:59,"Thanks to VaxTeen.org I see that several states that require parental consent for most medical treatment to teens have an exception for STDs. So what we need is some research demonstrating that COVID-19 can be sexually transmitted. Once it's classified as an STD, teens could get vaccinated without parental consent."

2021-06-26 19:53:07,"It’s ironic.  Kids can, without parental permission, engage in sexual activity.  But vaccination?  That demands parental permission.  So effectively we could pregnant, unvaccinated teens, which puts both the mother and unborn child at risk."

Actually I think most colleges would view that as an intelligent applicant taking necessary steps in an extraordinary situation.  I think she should include it in her essay.

If her first choice views this as a negative it may be time to consider another college."

2021-06-26 20:02:19,"The willful self-inflicted ignorance and selfishness of these parents is astounding. It was 1955 when Jonas Salk introduced the polio vaccine and parents around the world raced their kids to the doc saying, ""Give him/her the shot"". And so did mine. 

It worked and then Sabin came out with his oral sugar cube vaccine. That was over sixty years ago and I just read that with the exception of some village in Pakistan, polio has been eradicated from the face of the earth. And so it is with smallpox.

2021-06-26 20:06:37,"It's disturbing how data-free these assumptions are. The risk with Covid isn't necessarily getting it, the risk is in passing it to someone who won't survive. The kid won't die, but his parents and grandparents and so on might.

To a casual observer, it's mid-boggling that people wouldn't rush to vaccinate their child against something that already has killed over 600,000 people. Even if you think the number is inflated by 3x, 200,000 excess deaths is a heck of a lot (don't check that math, I'm rushing).

According to the CDC, under 500 children 17 or under have died. That's great odds, except for the parents of those kids. On the other hand, almost 580,000 children have contracted Covid. There are no statistics to show who those 580,000 children might have passed Covid on to. That's the real benefit to vaccinating kids and a big part of why Covid spread and mortality is continuing to edge down.

Here's the data:

2021-06-26 20:10:53,Parents who refuse to allow their children to get the vaccine are unfit to be parents.
2021-06-26 20:12:42,"I Absolutely concur that refusing to allow one's child to be vaccinated against a deadly virus is child abuse.  Quite frankly vaccination against COVID-19 should be mandatory for minor children and should be required for enrollment in public or private education. 

This is NOT a political issue there are not to debatable sides to the issue.  SARS CoV-2 is a deadly virus.  Vaccines should be available to children 12 to 18 on demand by the patient without the permission of the parent or guardian, and in fact should be required for all children for which it is efficacious."
2021-06-26 20:12:58,Forbidding vaccinations is yet another indicator that we need to start regulating who can have a child.

I hope that she can forgive you for this invasive, autocratic statement."
2021-06-26 20:14:09,"Sadly many teenagers are much smarter and better informed than their parents.

Suppressed but alive, everywhere. That divorced parents would use the issue of a child's health to spite each other shows just how much it is about the power struggle between them and how little the child's desires, needs or well being are considered. Examples of evil hearts at work. Freedom for me but not for thee."
2021-06-26 20:27:19,"It could very well be that these kids, so controlled by their parents when minors, could shun their parents as soon as they are able. If so, the parents would have only reaped what they sowed."

Such decisions have always been a gray area and always will be.  There is no clear right or wrong answer, except to those who never see gray in any issue. Neither parents nor the state have unlimited authority over the care of children. … Two parents disagreeing between themselves is an entirely different issue."

2021-06-26 20:58:20,"Age doesn't make a person wise, as there are so many examples around. Nor does youth make any person foolish. 
My parents were very strict people, in their own perception. They thought they were preventing me from engaging in dangerous activities. I learned to deceive them so I could get involved in the activities of a normal youth. It was not the best scenario but the opposite would have been risking my development as a young person and an adult. I never engaged in risky behavior.
So my advise to any young person whose parents are trying to prevent from getting vaccinated is to use all their imagination to get a shot in their arms. They can get advice from people who know the system and can help in finding the loopholes. Do not give up.

We also know that 95% of those vaccinated never get the virus or if they do, they don't get very sick.
 
And we know that some vanishingly small percentage of younger males -- of the millions of doses administered --develop incidental heart issues.
 
When you consider the numbers, it's insupportable not to get the kids vaccinated.  Maybe even child abuse."

I've given up on hoping our fellow citizens will do the right thing."
2021-06-26 21:05:05,"I think both teenagers and parents should treat this matter more rationally. 

I am an 8th grader and I just got my second shots last week. After the shots, my biggest change is probably not wearing masks, before I got my vaccine, I will forget my mask when going into a shop, but now I will never have to worry about wearing a mask. Also, another benefit is I can hang out with my friends more often.

I know many parents must be worried about the side effect of the vaccine. After my first shot, to be honest except for the soreness of my arm I didn't feel bad at all. The day after my second shot I feel a little dizzy, but that might be Heatstroke since that day is 40 degrees Celcius. Besides that everything else is good.

However, everyone's body is different, make the best choice for your child!"

Now sixty some years later, I have had dozens of vaccines and I am still quite healthy.  When did science become a villain?"

I do not remember having a large percentage of the population being against the Salt vaccine.  I have no memory of parents being against the Smallpox vaccine either.

Why point this out?  There isn't any way for this nation to have a large percentage of anti-vaxxers unless there are people or organizations that try to indoctrinate them.

Vaccines save lives.  The risks of vaccines is much less than the risk of getting Covid or any other deadly disease.  The best course of action is to vaccinate as many people as possible and though I believe these parents mean well, they are endangering their children and society. 

One last point.  When Trump was president, I believe he added to the distrust of the CDC, FDA and vaccines in general.  I believe, Trump increased the numbers of people who are now hesitant.  I also believe that has cost the nation many lives."

When we were all eligible for the shot not one of us wasted a moment getting all ourselves there. We suffered together and then we celebrated together when we made it out on the other side.

As the song says (almost), a cube full of sugar helped the oral polio vaccine go down. A few years later, a TV ad campaign recommending the measles vaccine. ""Get the Rubella Umbrella!"" 

To generations that knew enough to be scared to death of what these diseases could do, these vaccines and others were a Godsend. For a while, measles was more or less vanquished in this country. Then, a few people decided that a fast route to book sales, TV bookings, and the attention of the crowd was to scare people about the vaccines instead of the diseases. And now, Measles is Back, and in no small way. And if we don't find a way to these charlatans, they'll bring polio, tetanus and small pox back, too."

2021-06-26 21:58:00,"I am ambivalent about this issue.  I think teenagers should have a major role in deciding whether they get any vaccination.  

However, that does not mean they should have sole authority to determine whether they get vaccinated.

There is strong argument to be made for a parent preventing their child from getting this vaccination.  I do not say that as an anti-vaxxer.  I am definitely not an anti-vaxxer and I got this vaccine as soon as I could.  

But I am 72.  The older a person is, the greater the harm they are likely to suffer if they get infected with this Covid virus.  Whereas young people seldom suffer more than mild symptoms if they get infected (many suffer no symptoms at all).  However, the risks of this new vaccine are largely unknown.  Whatever risks there turn out to be, they are likely to be more substantial the younger the person is (since they have to live much longer with whatever risk problem manifests itself).

Therefore, the vaccination trade-off between risk and reward is very much in favor of vaccination for older people.  But for the very young that trade-off is not nearly as much in favor of vaccination.  I can see how a reasonable parent could decide that the unknown risks from these vaccines are sufficient reason to forego the benefit of preventing mild symptoms for their young children."

I, for one, expected exactly this. In the early '80s, during a period of rapidly rising medical costs, my employer and many others floated schemes to give people 'more control' over their health.

As someone who grew up in th South where Carter's Little Liver Pills were on every drugstore counter, and where I studied folk remedies for sore throat (a red flannel neck cloth was less harmful than a swallow of turpentine), and as a news reporter who covered con artist, I knew this would happen.

Out forefathers, operating in a environment where there were a lot more people without significant formal education, knew better and required public health measures. Today, people have more days of schooling but most of us are just as ignorant about the state of medical practice as our grandparents who left school in fifth grade.

It’s always about the ability of anyone, child, teen, or adult to truly understand what is being asked and what are the risks/benefits. And yes they want parents on board, but no one is going to stop a child from getting the health care they need. And you’d be surprised how much a 12 year old can understand.

Like, say, that the reason the kid wants privacy with the doctor, or STD testing, or plan B or the HPV shot so badly is because they are being sexually abused by an uncle or coach and are terrified to tell anyone. And it’s hard to tell a doctor or nurse if you never get private time alone without parents. (And parents can be hard to tell) 

So here, teens can get, not just vaccines, but birth control, abortion, condoms, Plan B and Naloxone Kits, or everything from doctors exams to surgery—as long as they can really comprehend the issue and that comprehension level can change."

Maybe the various states ought focus on legislation that solves this type of horrendous problem, rather than on permitting children as young as 11 — who don’t have the actual brain cells yet in place to exercise truly sound judgement (ask car insurers if you doubt) or to give fully-informed consent to things less consequential than medical interventions.

And having schools require vaccinations is a better place to start in terms of ensuring kids have access to vaccines and are in fact vaccinated than to allow or expect a 5th grader to make complex medical decisions.

2021-06-26 23:35:38,"I'm fully vaccinated (2 Moderna shots, months ago). But I agree with those who don't consent to their children being vaccinated. It might be tough in divorce situations, or where the parent gets vaccinated himself but refuses to allow his child to do so, but almost always the parent makes the same decision for himself and his child.  What's wrong with that?

I can understand not letting an unvaccinated child socialize with other children, and I can see quibbling about what the age of consent should be, but why should we otherwise impose our views on parents? Aren't we essentially telling those parents that they ought to agree with us? Or that someone else (e.g., ""society"" -- whatever that means) should make the decision?

If  a parent declines to get vaccinated (and is willing to accept the social and personal consequences) and makes the same choice for his 2-year old, why should we object?"
2021-06-26 23:36:59,"A note of caution for these parents: my friend never had her kids vaccinated against anything and was quite opinionated about how shots were unnecessary and potentially dangerous. 

When her kids went to college, they discovered for the first time that they weren’t vaccinated. They didn’t talk to her for two years. And she felt stupid, and felt they beyond despised her.

I myself was dubious about the necessity for Gardasil and concerned because of family autoimmune issues. So I talked to my kids (who’d had all their other shots) frankly about it. We talked about all the things that cause HPV to become persistent and I told them they had to be honest with themselves about all the issues that affect that. I told them they had free access to both the pediatrician and the GYN, and should make their own thoughtful decision, with my full permission on file. I have no idea what they decided to do, and I don’t care. 

Kids over 12 may not be mature, but they can participate in decisions about their own bodies. They’re going to do so, in fact, whether you “permit” it or not, so you might as well help them to be thoughtful and informed about it."
2021-06-26 23:38:37,Those teenagers are obviously higher on the evolutionary scale than mom or dad.
2021-06-26 23:39:30,I'm sure all of you who are in favor of teens making their own decision about getting the vaccine are also in favor of teens making their own decision not to.
2021-06-26 23:40:40,"COVID-19 vaccination is a public health issue. If parents are misinformed by ideologically tinged media consumption, are ignorant of scientific evidence, or are otherwise misguided, then the law should step in to protect children and ensure that they have access to the vaccines that will save their lives and those of those around them."
2021-06-26 23:43:51,"I was able to leave an abusive home at thirteen without the State stepping in, but it was neither legal or sanctioned.  

I believe that every child, especially a teenager, should have the opportunity to file for Emancipation, period.  

The legal system needs to wake up and value a young person’s ability to discern when their home is abusive and this is a great example."
2021-06-26 23:44:38,"These parents who are ""frightened by the newness of the shots"" had best buckle their seatbelts for a whole lot of newness to come from every direction in this world. To be a terrific parent, one must remain ready to learn and assess risks in a rapidly changing world. This is an example of parents putting their own children at greater risk -- not to mention everyone else in the world, as our risks go down every single time a vaccine is administered -- and also of the clear-sightedness of many youngsters. A sad story. Yes, please, a legislative assist to these teens, a la the HPV laws, seems warranted. Why not do it at the federal level and thereby minimize costs to administer / enforce?"
2021-06-26 23:44:42,"I have great empathy for these young adults. And I hope they seek emotional support for the trauma suffered when their parents do not respect their right to be concerned about their own health and their need for education. 

In Pennsylvania the age of legal consent for mental healthcare is 14. So a teen can seek and receive that care without parental approval; furthermore the parent is not privy to the licensed psychotherapist or psychiatrist diagnosis or notes. This is especially important if they are suffering other parental abuse."
2021-06-26 23:45:02,"I’m curious, have there been any cases of minors refusing to be vaccinated despite their parents’ insistence?"
2021-06-26 23:45:25,"Wow, I am going to get my 5 year old vaccinated as soon as I can. While she isn't crazy about shots, she is excited about not having to worry about covid or wear a mask anymore. Denying them to your kids is insanity."
2021-06-26 23:45:39,"My parents were divorced and I was married for over 32 years to a divorce attorney who represented children in very difficult custody situations, so I have probably thought about this subject more than most people.  One thing I wish all parents, divorced or otherwise, would understand and appreciate is that after the age of emancipation, which in the U.S. is typically 18 years, your child has absolutely no obligation to ever be in touch with you again, or let you have any contact with future grandchildren. I respect an honest difference of opinions, but in at least some of these scenarios, I bet it's a power struggle between exes pitting their offspring in the middle and that's a very bad idea."

So when we have vaccination clinics in the schools, as we do, the permission forms come home to be signed.  But if the guardian/parent does not sign, the child can still choose on their own to receive a vaccine that day, if the nurse decides that they are capable of giving informed consent.

Of course you cannot attend public schools here if you are behind on your vaccines.  You will be suspended.

I love it.  I guess if you want your kid to have measles or meningitis or diphtheria, this system is not optimal, but it's great for the rest of us."
2021-06-26 23:47:14,"I am one of these kids, so seeing an article like this is great. I'm 17 years old and am well informed about the vaccine, however my parents did not want me to get the vaccine. I just filled out the paperwork under their name and used my moms name to sign it. I had to have my brother come with me but my mom actually signed that one off for me! Just not the consent forms."
2021-06-26 23:48:25,I suspect the 16-18 year olds could find a fake id if they spent a little time on it. I bet the vaccine sites don't check as closely as the local beer joints.
2021-06-26 23:48:40,"What caught my attention is that some Southern states are legislating AGAINST children getting vaccinated. Everytime the South has an opportunity to do the right thing, it does the wrong thing. After the Civil War, the South had a chance to make a new beginning, but instead it tried to approximate Slavery 2.0 in the form of Jim Crow. After the Civil Rights Movement it had a chance to go right on voting rights, but instead it got Shelby permission from its flunkies on the Supreme Court to birth Jim Crow 2.0: a slew of new voter suppression laws.

Now, after diligent and intelligent scientists have created the tools to defeat a murderous pandemic, the South is so focused on making the Democrats' good-government policies fail, it is willing to sabotage the nation's public health, including children's public health. Because good public health is emblematic of good government.

In my mind, the South is just a disgrace."

And guess what - her child came down with polio and is crippled for life. I have often wondered if she feels any remorse or guilt for how her ideology that is based on lies and a rejection of science ruined her child’s life. 

Vaccines are one of the greatest miracles of the modern world. That parents willfully expose their children to risks that could be easily averted is the height of hubris and arrogance."

2021-06-26 23:51:55,"Most (all?) of the ""Vacinnate them"" commenters are really pointing out that vaccination is the decision they would make (and it's the decision I'VE made). But who am I to tell someone else that they can't make this decision for their minor child? I must confess that I'd find it very odd that an adult would decide to get vaccinated himself, but not consent to his minor child doing the same, but I'd accept even that since the ages are much different. If a parent is willing to accept the social isolation that inevitably follows a choice not to be vaccinated, and is willing to accept that for his 2-year old too, who are we (or ""society"") to say he's wrong?"
2021-06-26 23:51:57,"The disinformation that the covid-19 vaccine could have ANY effect on reproductive health is a Tucker Carlson meme.

2021-06-27 00:05:37,"lay down the law!
just as authorities screen residents for lawful purposes before a hurricane strikes, advise parents of teenagers who want to be vaccinated that if they refuse to give permission they will be charged with criminally negligent homicide if the teen dies. And regarding grown adults who refuse the vaccine, stop worrying and let nature take it's course. They are responsible for their own deaths if they die. We did our best to save them. It's natural selection."
2021-06-27 00:06:50,"There is a difference between allowing parents to make a decision on vaccines for teen children and disagreeing with that decision.  It is inevitable that some things a parent must decide for their kids.  But I see no reason why the rest of us cannot criticize a bad decision.  Preventing teenage children from getting the disease is a bad decision.  Covid is much more dangerous than the vaccine, and even if kids get a mild case of covid, they might spread it to more vulnerable people.  If we want to end this epidemic, vaccines are the best tool we have.

Traditionally parents try to prevent kids from doing things that are bad for them.  What does it say about our society that there are a significant number of people who want to prevent their kids from doing something that is good for them and for everyone?"
2021-06-27 00:09:56,"The time has come for the FDA to get rid of the EUA. Just how many people need to be vaccinated before it considered safe. With Polio vaccine it was just the opposite, the government did not have enough vaccine because under estimated the demand."

I’ve been asked by several people of all walks of life if I think they should get the vaccine. I looked each person in the eye and said “Do you think all the rich white people would be running to get the vaccine if it was so bad?” Everyone thought, and blinked. It may have worked in a few cases."
2021-06-27 00:28:13,"The New Yorker Radio Hour recently featured a heartbreaking interview with a 16 year old from AZ who was prevented from getting the vaccine by his parents, who were knee deep in misinformation/conspiracy theories (both parents believe the vaccine will alter their child's DNA, etc.). This young man was also feeling increasingly isolated from his friends, who were all vaccinated and had greater freedom to socialize with less restrictions. He's desperate to find a solution or a workaround that won't alienate him from his parents. This is just one example of the fallout from the lies and disinformation that's spoon fed to gullible people at the expense of their own health and that of their families."
2021-06-27 00:34:57,"Thank you for writing about this, the most accurate piece I’ve read that takes the issue of divorced parents and teens into consideration. For the first time in my kids’ lives - personal views, opposition and difficulty co-parenting together is on full display. I mean it in saying - it’s nice to know I’m not alone in having this dialogue. I tell the kids to talk to their teachers, be open to other opinions, find mentors. It’s not easy…"
2021-06-27 00:38:28,"All issues of consent involving minors are tricky. While it’s socially necessary to establish something like an age of majority, people younger than that age should and do have at least some rights to personal and bodily autonomy. I think it’s enlightened of some states to have a threshold age for medical consent that’s lower than the one for other types of consent. Most people are developmentally ready to understand the risks and benefits of medical treatments in a medical setting before being ready to make decisions like joining the military or entering a binding contract.

Adults have the right to make bad decisions on their own behalf—there could be no freedom as we know it if they didn’t. But we do recognize some points at which parents may not make bad decisions on behalf of their children. I’m not in favor of intensive government intrusion to force people to vaccinate their children against their will, but children who want to be vaccinated should have some path to be vaccinated if a parent objects."

2021-06-27 00:51:29,"There is no reason the laws shouldn't be changed to allow teens aged 14 and up to make their own decisions regarding vaccines.  Vaccines are one of the safest medical procedures out there with little risk beyond allergic reactions unless you have an underlying condition (re: cancer treatment, immunocompromized, etc...) at which point doctors won't even offer them to you.  

Since anti-vaxxers have become so prolific, teens need to be able to protect themselves when their parents aren't doing so because they are following conspiracy theories.  Yes, sometimes kids are smarter than their parents."
2021-06-27 00:52:06,"If the Covid-19 were responsible for causing over 600,000 people to die is not enough to inform you that Covid-19 is a seriously dangerous illness, then you are not paying attention to reality.  

Also, more than 100 million people have received Covis-19 vaccines and very few encountered serious negative reactions.  

These are overwhelmingly positive numbers and statistics.  Science and medicine have improved to help people live.  

The so call adults who would not let their children receive vaccines are sadly gambling on their children's lives.  

Please read up on the subject instead of believing some naysayers.  Then make an informed decision for the benefit of the children.

2021-06-27 00:55:16,"This is a little off topic, but today an NCAA baseball game was cancelled because of COVID-19. NC State was supposed to play Vanderbilt for a chance to go to the finals of the college World Series. Vanderbilt players (18 to 21 year olds) had been 100% vaccinated. Approximately half of the young men from NC State decided not to get jabbed. Due to COVID issues within their program, NC State essentially had to forfeit the game and go home.
   Vanderbilt moves on to face Texas or Mississippi State in the finals.
   I’m sure many of these young men wish they had made a different decision about being vaccinated. Remember, these athletes are only marginally older than the individuals described in this article. 
   I thing young people know enough by now about the advantages versus the disadvantages of getting the vaccine."
2021-06-27 00:59:49,"I am so fortunate that all of my friends and close family members believe in science and we19re determined to get their respective children vaccinated.  Unfortunately I cannot get my son vaccinated at this time because authorization for his age is still pending.  However, as soon as his age group is allowed he will be getting the shot.  He is terrified of needles and every year when it is time for him to get his flu shot it is always a struggle, but I told him being uncomfortable for a few minutes is better than being sick for two weeks or more. I have been prepping him regarding the COVID-19 for a couple of months now and told him it will be 2 shots.

COVID should not be spreading rampant and yet it is because folks are not getting vaccinated even though vaccines are available to all without an appointment."

2021-06-27 01:02:29,"Why should we allow parents to stop their kids from making responsible choices? If they are old enough to learn to drive, they are old enough to make the decision on whether to be vaccinated. If I was a parent in this situation, I would have my child make the decision."
2021-06-27 01:02:35,"What is it with these parents who'd deny their kids the protection of a vaccine? Are they misinformed, or just plain ornery. I suspect if the CDC, Dr. Fauci, or President Biden gave a speech recommending AGAINST vaccination, they’d all rush to get vaccinated."
2021-06-27 01:03:45,"As a general rule in our legal and ethical system, if people want to recklessly endanger their own lives, they are free to do so. Recklessly endangering the life of another generally carries the distinct possibility of a civil and even a criminal sanction. Recklessly endangering the life of one's own child for no better reason than some irrational need to stubbornly cling to insupportable points of view that are demonstrably false is abject moral bankruptcy. There are many situations in which duly constituted authorities are empowered to temporarily or permanently deny a parent the right to make decisions for a child. If our political systems were reasonably functional and able to act in the best interests of children, which admittedly is expecting rather a lot in these times, there would be a summary process available to minors to authorize vaccinations in spite of the wishes of misdirected parents. It is not unconstitutional for our government to act in furtherance of health and welfare when the need to do so is scientifically demonstrable."

There is so much more peer pressure and bullying now, Why should they have to worry about their health and the Covid epidemic?

I raised my three boys through their teen age years. And, it was not easy. I had been married for 24 years until my husband had an affair and left me.

I ended up moving away to be closer to my family for emotional and financial support. My two younger sons sons were just seven and nine years old.

It was very difficult. My sons were extremely angry with their father, and there were many years that they barely spoke.

I had to work hard with them when they struggled in school, and had to weather the rebellious years when they smoked too much marijuana and drank to excess. One of my son’s got drunk and totaled our family car when he turned 21. 

My oldest son, unfortunately, was aware of his father’s affair for many years before I was. It was too much of a moral dilemma for him, and he refused to see or talk to me for almost 20 years.

He is now in his late 30s and we are again close. But, I feel so sad about the years that we lost.

My two younger sons are now in their late 20s, and are also doing well. One just completed his work on a Ph.D. and has an active practice in psychotherapy.

Most of the people who now believe in all things Trump will never change. They'll pass into their dotage and then their graves with delusions intact. The question is what successive generations will believe.

Some children never stop doubting their parents' wisdom in everything. Far more start doubting it (even when it's sound) in adolescence. By the age of responsibility, most people have outgrown mere rebelliousness and have become genuinely astute at spotting their parents' follies and separating the wheat from the chaff in their parents' teachings. Knowing better than Mom and Dad is part of individual adulthood and social enlightenment.

This is cause for great hope. It took the house of Frankenstein several sequels to get out from under its curse, but Trumpist America will surely do better."

If a minor child happens to be one of those rare cases of injury from the vaccine the parent becomes responsible for not only the ensuing bills for healthcare but also what could be long term care for their child. This is an important consideration when the risk of long term injury or death from covid is extraordinarily low for the child and teen demographic. 

Vaccine manufacturers have no liability for their products the way car or toy manufacturers do. Even if something happens to someone due to gross negligence the company is immune from responsibility. This law was enacted in 1986, since then those who have been injured by vaccines have had to spend years petitioning for money from ‘vaccine court’ which is not at all like our legal system. 

I’m not saying this is a reason not to get the covid vaccine but I can understand why a parent that is teetering on the edge of abject poverty and working to make ends meet is wary of a vaccine for a disease that is generally not severe in teens. Laws of consent are written in part to allow the person who will bear the burden of the decision, should it go poorly, to be the one making the informed choice."

2021-06-27 03:25:30,"When I was very young, there were a lot of things provided through school that made it clear that parents may not know everything. Various health screenings, DUSO the dolphin puppet shows that taught us about empathy, staining tablets to help us learn to brush our teeth properly, milk break to be sure everyone got a nutritious snack, hearing tests, speech assessments and therapy. And you could not go to school without your vaccines. I don't know how things are done now, but I would guess that at least some students will always another source of adult guidance and help in their lives. This is one of those cases."

We send children to school, teach them critical thinking skills and then refuse to let them actually work it out for themselves if they should get vaccinated. Hopefully states will treat children less as property of their parents and more as human beings capable of making decisions."

We need to stop treating our children as something we control and start taking on the responsibility of preparing them to make their own long term decisions.

Someday I may not love the decisions they make, but I hope they will have made them after thorough education and with consideration for their own responsibilities and with empathy for others."

I may be allowing my own biases to get the better of me, but can’t help wondering about the degree to which he may be using / abusing his daughter to make / score (in his mind) a political point by stopping her and giving himself an excuse to go to war with her school, and / or to score points in a power struggle with his wife.

Even if he is truly scared of the vaccine, i would still find his actions incredibly disrespectful of his 17-yr-old daughter and ill-advised on those grounds, unless he is ambition is to have a permanently fraught relationship with her.

They seem to have a very selective view of the importance of freedom that befins and ends with their own.  At best, it suggests an unwillingness to accept that the freedom to choose does not come with a right to expect all of their choices to be free of unwanted consequences.  And, at worst it seems like nothing more than a self-centred and unprincipled desire to choose for themselves and dictate to others."

A child who wants the vaccine has shown his or her intelligence and maturity and should immediately be given this control over his or her own body.  If the child were to come down with Covid-19,  it is the child who would suffer.  Further, the costs of treatment would probably fall on the state or others through insurance costs and we would all wind up paying for such foolishness and ignorance."

I remember the yearly ritual of my mother taking us to the military hospital on whatever base was nearby for our required shots.   With relatives in Hong Kong, we had to get the cholera shot every time we visited.  When we moved to Laos/Thailand I had to get a gamma globulin shot before school started, it was the only defense against hepatitis at that time.  TB tests in the school cafeteria every year.   Booster shots.   I'm now 61 and have never suffered any reaction from the shots.   It really shocks me that parents have done a 180 degrees against the science to the detriment of their children.  If I were 15 and denied the vax by my parents, I probably would hold that over their heads for the rest of their lives.   Remember parents, your kids will have to take care of you when you are elderly, how would you like proper medical care withheld because your child refuses to believe medical science?"

We all are young only once, these years are so important and being denied normal social interactions because of parental despotism might lead to many more harmful consequences in a person's life.
Not to mention that also young people can get seriously ill from Covid-19 or develop long-term symptoms even having only a very mild acute course of disease. Or the yet uncharted threat from delta which seems to be more dangerous for younger patients than the wild type. Teens are not stupid, they are aware what is happening and should be heard and respected when a decision concerns their life."

No child of a reasonable age should be denied the right to protect one's health and safety, in spite of parental objections.  It is a disgrace that the United States continues to ignore the importance of ratifying this important human rights treaty.  The right to health care should be not be denied to young persons, simply because their parents object."

What that probably highlights is that the FDA is operating at a snail’s pace, and needs a kick in the pants to hurry up and issue final approval.  What is taking them so long?  It can’t be a lack of data, surely, since over 100M people have received jabs.  

Sure, many ignoramuses will still refuse to get the vaccine.  But even if only 10% of the current resisters will line up to get vaxxed after final FDA authorisation, that ought to be enough for them to get on with the analyses and issue a final approval."

Often this is circumvented deliberately by the family through isolation within restrictive living conditions, by parents selecting schools and any activities which effectively isolate these minors from reasonable adults who may intervene.

Of course large group offenders are religious sects, but also people who are simply inept parents.  We need a more comprehensive education system with systems in place to channel children towards assistance.  As it is, and has been for years, kids depend on the random intervention and support of heroic smart teachers, relatives, other peoples´ parents and the occasional great social agency to help them get free of destructive and dangerous parents."

The consequence is that we remain the sole nation where minors are merely chattel, with exceedingly limited human rights.

The CRC expressly states in Article 12 that children have a right to be heard and their views considered with regard to healthcare.

And what kind of parent does this because of fear of imaginary dangers of a vaccine, or a desire for political posturing, or to indirectly get back at a divorced spouse, or because they think they own their child's body? And what kind of parent is convinced that their medical judgement is superior to that of virologists, epidemiologists and those capable of developing and properly testing a vaccine?

Unfortunately 2020 and 06JAN2021 taught America that we have way too many “adults” who act like children. 

Unfortunately, as COVID continues to be politicized, we are seeing how our children are clearly more mature and rational than the immature narrow-minded parents “raising” them. In actuality, I would not be surprised if these same kids have always been either the “adult” in the home or parentified.

For the 40-60 year old parents out there who are “anti-vaxers” GROW UP!!!

I’ve been working in the substance abuse field for close to 40 years. The average American may not realize it but alcohol is doing more damage to their bodies than some of these other chemicals they fear. I suspect alcohol abuse has more to do with Aspergers than the vaccinations they are trying to blame.

And even if there are risks in getting the COVID shot, statistically speaking, it’s better than the alternatives!!! 

I just got the 2nd shot. I had to delay getting vaccinated because of steroid treatments. I had no side effects with the 1st one and a significantly mild side effect (slight swelling in shot area) with the 2nd one. Even if I had had a significant side effect, comparing possible non-death reactions to my sister’s bout with COVID, I would line up every day for a year and subject myself to a COVID vaccination — to avoid the  pain and suffering I witnessed.

Prayers that our children of today make for more responsible adults tomorrow!!!"

If my children had not wanted the vaccine, I don't think I could have or would have forced them. I would have asked our family doc to educate them. You can't very well drag a teenager to a vaccination site and hold him/her down.)"
2021-06-30 02:56:14,It's a shame when parents neglect their kid's health like that. To me they should be investigated by child protective services.
2021-06-21 13:52:05,"The article identifies a problem but fails to offer any guidance to those of us with underlying conditions that affect our immune systems.  As the article states, there are millions of us.  The only things we are told is that the vaccine might not give adequate protection and we need to be careful.  Is science developing a quantitative test so we can know how much protection we have?  What actions do we need to take or not take?"
2021-06-21 14:06:04,"Is the American Red Cross still testing for antibodies when you donate blood.  If so, are they using the correct test?"
2021-06-21 14:09:43,"My blood donation vendor- Vitalant, Colorado- tests donations with one or two antibody tests. The first, lower price test is whether you have antibodies at all. The second, high price test is after the first test is positive. It tests for antigens to virus proteins not normally stimulated by the vaccines. That can discriminate whether you have have been infected by covid or just the vaccine. After being fully vaccinated, my first test flipped positive and second test stayed negative. (My take is a positive test for infection makes blood more valuable for convalescent therapy.)

Note, they dont want a donations while you are in the middle of vaccination process. I recall the wait is two weeks after a mRNA or protein vaccination and a month after an inactivated virus. The latter is not offered in the US. Also both a donation or vaccination tire some people for a period of time. You want to spread them out."
2021-06-21 14:29:02,"I seem to recall from my college Immunology courses that it is expected that antibodies will decline over time, but that the body retains an immunological memory and can reproduce the antibodies again, very quickly, if stimulated by a new bout of disease. Is this still believed to be true? If yes, why would antibody levels matter that much?"
2021-06-21 14:43:53,"I thought a second vaccine injection should rapidly induce levels of protective antibody - at most, within a very few days after a second shot. The article says though not to expect ""detectable"" levels of antibody until at least two weeks after the second shot, which I find surprising. Is this long delay something unique to these vaccines or to COVID?"
2021-06-21 15:02:22,"Interesting. I'm wondering is my 20-something daughter who had pneumonia last year in March and finally got over it and some other weird symptoms and then got a negative antibody test in the summer got the wrong test.

Well, she's vaccinated now, so like this article said, it's moot."
2021-06-21 15:32:43,"I am among those chided for still masking up every moment I am outside my apartment and avoiding indoor socializing.  As a 70 plus, I developed a set of chronic conditions that are annoying to my functioning (like idiopathic neuropathy) but could put me more at risk for COVID-21 Delta that is now threating us despite my being fully vaccinated.                                                                       . 
    I thought that if I could get an antibody test maybe I could join others declaring the pandemic is over for me as well. However, this article indicates that such tests are as confusing as COVID-19 detection tests have been.           
         So better safe than sorry as I continue to enjoy my Zooms from all over the world and home photo and writing projects and mask up  outside my apartment until more are vaccinated-- including children under 12--and they develop a booster for COVID-21 Delta. I know too many long haulers from my Zooms to risk contracting a so called ""mild case"" of this viral infection."
2021-06-21 15:34:18,"Interesting, but also raises additional questions.  Maybe on of the NYTimes's reporters could ask an immunologist (doesn't have to be Tony Fauci) just how well antibody levels correspond to having actual immunity against Covid-19 after getting both vaccine shots.  I thought that the so-called cellular immunity (T-cell mediated) is at least equally important for our ability to mount a robust immune response against Covid-19 as the B-cell mediated antibody response.  
As your article and the postings here show, having good and scientifically sound answers to this question can be important to better judge just how ready we are to go back to work or mingle with others."
2021-06-21 15:40:12,"This piece reports it's the cardiologist who ordered the antibody test for Mr. Lat. So the question is what led the cardiologist to order the nonsensical N protein test and why is Mr. Lat blaming himself for the wrong test. In my experience, it's the lab used by the hospital or clinic that determines the method used for that test. To learn which type of test the lab uses or to order something not on the menu takes a call to the lab director, which in turn, means going through the switchboard.

But the antibody test only measures the humoral (circulating) immune response and, at this point, the effective level of antibodies is not established. The other, and possibly more important immune response is cellular and the tests to measure that response are too complex for clinical use.

But the good news is that two shots of the US approved vaccines do protect against serious Covid 19 and the variants known at this time, for most of us.

A research question would be is there a threshold of antibody levels necessary to trigger a cellular response; if there is a threshold, what would it be? Until then, it would make sense for immune compromised patients to be tested for the presence or absence of the spike antibody. Its absence would be meaningful.

This is my understanding, as a primary care physician."
2021-06-21 15:45:00,"There is quite a variable response of IgG production after vaccination, but it is not fully known that ""low"" responders are less protected than ""high"" responders-- long term or shorter term.  It's very important that we study this (and we are studying it, as are others.). People who are immunosuppressed probably should be getting tests for anti-spike protein antibodies."
2021-06-21 16:15:47,"This article may give a lot of people an inaccurate sense of the role of testing after infection OR immunization.  It is not at all clear to me as a practicing academically affiliated MD that there is ANY reliable predictive data that correlates a test after COVID  vaccination with ""practical"" immunity in real world situations. There are many examples where, with other vaccinations, such ""titers"" do NOT reliably predict risk going forward.  Potentially such testing for COVID vaccination could be a waist of resources or worse, give inaccurate ""information"" for practical use. I think we need a LOT more information and I think ""experts"" should avoid making pronouncements outside of a formally organized ""best practices"" group, gathering all the best available data and practical experience.  (Pending better data from multiple high quality studies)."
2021-06-21 17:07:21,"Everyone in our immediate family is fully vaccinated. All of us, except out younger daughter, an adolescent who is disabled and immunocompromised, had a response to the second shot to varying degrees. She was on a ventilator for three weeks nine years ago. We were told then that she would likely not survive another similar situation. She is nonverbal, so couldn’t tell us if she wasn’t feeling well after the second shot, which was two weeks ago last week. She’s having an antibody test today. This was a timely article for our family. We will know better what questions to ask. Thanks."
2021-06-21 17:10:53,"The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society is conducting studies of treated and untreated patients’ responses to vaccinations. I have an indolent B cell lymphoma and was tested twice. I had strong antibodies one month after my second vaccination and ten times as strong three months later. Many others with similar diagnoses had zero response. I will continue to mask and be careful but those others will still need to isolate, especially with Delta lurking. I disagree that folks shouldn’t get tested. Of course we all need to know if we’ve responded and then may adjust our activities and behaviors accordingly."
2021-06-21 14:29:49,"""Many doctors are still unaware...""
Trust the 'experts' but, just to be sure, become an armchair virologist yourself by reading an explainer article in a newspaper, then, get several official medical opinions, toss the contradictory ones in a hat and pick one. Next, pay the enormous and often unexpected bills that start showing up in your mailbox. But, do not worry about what new variants are waiting in the wings come flu season. Resume normal life while obsessively watching your emergency government decree screen in order to be sure to run and hide when the next germ spooks the herd. 
Got it..."
2021-06-21 14:44:05,"Great article!  I love that you use real immunologists as your sources here.  This summer is great time to get vaccinated if you haven't gotten around to it yet.  Costco has walkin appointments, as do a lot of places.  My 2 cents, not an immunologist, but if you are freaked out about the super rare risks...Over 55 get J and J, male over 40 get J and J, male under 30 get your first mRNA shot now (Moderna or Pfizer). If you are freaked about the risk of myocarditis, the first shot doesn't cause it.  By the time you are due for your second mRNA shot, we will know if it is smart to delay it or not, thanks to Canada.  Delta is nasty, vaccines keep you from having to go to the hospital. This ain't over. Don't worry, your fertility will be just fine."
2021-06-21 15:49:33,"Okay, if you’re immunocompromised don’t get N test.  Got it.  Get some other test to measure spikes instead.  And so that test is….?"
2021-06-21 15:52:27,"The line that leapt out at me was.....

"" he turned to Twittwer for an explanation""!!!!

Thank God I live in France!

As at an ""at risk patient"" I had received my second jab on Feb 19. Soon after I received a text from my transplant hospital informing me that new research suggested a third was recommended.

I had that 3rd jab on March 24 and after reading an article on this issue in the NYT, called up my doctor who emailed me a prescription for an anti spikes test.

Sadly that came back low, so am now awiting for the result of research being carried out in Nantes, France on the possibilities for other transplantees.

France gets a lot of stick, but boy do they have a fantastic medical sytem."
2021-06-21 15:56:37,"Specialists and the NYT:  ""Don't worry, be happy.""
Me:  ""Trust, but verify.""

Considering how error-prone the entire covid response has been, how dishonest the media and ""experts"" have been, and how sloppy is medical care in the US in general, because this virus has a high probability of deadly consquences, I'd like to know that in my case, those vaccines actually worked before I go traipsing around with the unvaccinated and still diseased hoi-polloi without an n95 mask, or even at all."
2021-06-21 16:07:25,"Dr. Dorry Segev who is quoted in this NYT article, is also quoted in a recent National Geographic article.  The Nat'l Geo piece is worth reading...

2021-06-21 17:50:38,"30 days after having the Cansino vaccine in Mexico, my wife and I went to a lab in the state capital to ask for an antibody test. The lab asked if it was to confirm a prior infection (N-capsule protein) or vaccine-generated antibodies (Receptor Binding Domain region of spike protein). We told them, they did the right test, and provided numeric IgM and IgG levels of RBD-specific antibodies.  This will allow us to do our own, lateral time study of antibody-decline with future tests.  Test cost was US$67.50 at an ISO-9001 certified lab.  Perhaps US labs should do a little research and think through what they're doing, as this lab did."
2021-06-21 18:12:50,"I am so annoyed because I asked three different health professionals if I should pause a medication I was taking before getting the vaccine. The answer was no. Three weeks after, when I felt so comfortable that I was safer, comes the news that I have a 10fold lower chance of not having developed antibodies. And the 'experts' wonder why they meet so much resistance to 'science'."
2021-06-21 19:21:45,"What about the virus variants, such as Delta — do any of the antibody tests allow for distinction between immunity to one variant or another?

Are pharmaceutical companies working on updating or upgrading the vaccines so that they are more effective in warding off the newer, more dangerous variants?

What about studying and addressing the impact of folks who can’t be bothered with going in to get their second dose of the vaccine — might they be contributing to the development of vaccine-resistant variants that could seed another pandemic?  Similar to how taking only a partial dose of antibiotic or not finishing the course of treatment can provide opportunity for drug-resistant microbes to develop?  Shouldn’t public health officials be following up with these people, even delivering the 2nd dose at their home if need be, so that vaccine-resistance doesn’t develop?

We would appreciate the NYT investing and reporting on these important concerns."
2021-06-21 13:33:46,This article would be much more helpful to people with compromised immune systems if it included the name of a test that is appropriate for the vaccines administered in the United States rather than only discussing and naming a test that is inappropriate.
2021-06-21 17:32:41,"I am conflicted about this article. On the one hand, this wanton testing is occurring so the subject is newsworthy. On the other hand, there is scant mention of how any of this testing is meant to affect management - is the cardiologist (cardiologist!) checking titers going to pursue a third covid vaccine? Are people with negative titers going to remain masked? What is the state of other commercial labs that assess for cellular immunity?"
2021-06-21 20:12:36,"The fundamental problem is that we haven't yet proven that the amount of antibodies produced correlates with protection from the virus. The human immune system is complex, and antibodies are only one small part of it. Sometimes high antibody levels are a good marker for immunity (such as the HepBsAb IgG antibody for Hepatitis B), and sometimes the levels are meaningless (such as the HepC IgG antibody and Hepatitis C). Unfortunately, the types of studies needed to look for a correlation between antibody levels and immunity will take months to years to complete. In the meantime, we have to accept the unfortunate fact that we simply don't have a test to reliably determine whether someone is truly protected from the virus or not."
2021-06-21 21:02:15,"Interesting. I had Covid in December and my doc had me take an antibody test a month later. Don't know which one, but it showed negative, or nearly negative antibodies so my doc wasn't sure I had had Covid despite a positive Covid test. I disagreed with him; I KNEW what I had during those December weeks. A month or so after my Moderna vaccines, I had another antibody test, and I'm loaded with antibodies. Whew! But I think I'll show my doc this article."
2021-06-21 21:06:50,"The commercial antibody tests that are done in hospitals or commercial laboratories measure antibody to spike protein. Maybe some of the point of care tests look for the nucleocapsid antibodies. Since the vaccine is designed to produce antibodies to spike proteins it is best to rely on a commercial lab. I was able to test myself before and after vaccine for antibodies to spike protein and I converted from negative to positive (full disclosure, I direct a hospital laboratory). The manufacturer at that time would not tell me if they had done studies for antibody production after vaccine."
2021-06-21 21:56:34,"I did not trust the vaccine to protect me after I read on so many sites that it protects 6 to 12 months. Six to twelve months? 
I thought, WHAT? 
I asked my doctor for a commercial lab test through our local hospital to detect antibodies to spike proteins in defense of Covid 19. 
Bingo. I have antibodies. 
The vaccine did it’s job."
2021-06-21 21:57:47,"I take low-dose prednisone daily and am physiologically dependent on it. I've taken it for 4 years. My doctors have not been helpful. My impression is that they don't want to give me bad or wrong advice for which they could be liable so they give no advice. 

Immunocompromised patients are left hanging out there. I am just acting like nothing has changed: I wear my mask and do social distancing. For me, the pandemic may never end...."
2021-06-21 21:37:20,The headline of this article seems deliberately misleading.
2021-06-21 23:44:34,"I was vaccinated with Sinovac vaccine, and took the ELISA antibody test 5weeks after my second vaccination. The lab generated a numerical result (cant remember the unit). The doctor said there’s no studies yet to tell us how much antibodies would infer immunity. What they usually use this antibody test is to determine eligibility of covid plasma donor, who has to have beyond 250 (units). My number after full vaccination of Sinovac was 30 , my husband 9, and my mom-in-law above 250."
2021-06-22 00:02:29,"I disagree with so called experts who don’t actually practice medicine. If they are claiming that all patients developed significant antibodies in their studies, my data strongly suggests otherwise in the real world. I have been testing for antibodies in all my patients and strongly recommend anyone who received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine or the Pfizer vaccine have their antibodies tested. My real world data contradicts their claims and the failure to develop antibodies with these 2 rather than Moderna may be related to the multistage process required to convert DNA to mRNA with J and J and the extreme temperature regulation required and human error risk with diluting and maintaining the Pfizer vaccine. Additionally, the need for booster shots should be based on each individuals response and maintenance of antibodies not the blanket assumption that everyone will respond the same to these vaccines. if the vaccine has only been widely used for 6 months, how can we say where antibody levels will be in 12 months? Test serial antibodies and you will not have to guess or hope."
2021-06-22 03:17:15,"The worst part of this issue and the biggest concern is due to the fact that there is still a fairly large fraction of people who won't get vaccinated. The virus is still spreading through the unvaccinated population, which puts people with low responses in danger. It also increases the liklihood that we will all have to go through it again with booster shots."
2021-06-22 03:25:57,"Two full years after successful CAR T-cell treatment for chemotherapy-resistant stage 4 B-cell lymphoma, my partner is fully cancer free and finally has a minimum level of normal T-cells, which will allow him to enjoy water contact and socializing with small numbers of fully-vaccinated adults. 

At doctor’s recommendation, he was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine back in February. It might have protected him somewhat, but he didn’t have a full complement of T-cells. Now, with his T-cells recovered, he would like to get a booster dose, but he’s been told that it’s not only ill-advised, but illegal! We will continue to wait until he is allowed a second round of the shots.

He is avoiding the general public, staying masked and socializing only with fully vaccinated people. He is nevertheless seeking a spike protein antibody test, just for a bit of peace of mind. It won’t change his behavior, but it would be so nice to know if the few T-cells he had back in February had managed to help produce some anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."

But I have to be honest, looking at only 14 of 41 people who were recruited for testing samples from their lymph nodes doesn't seem, well, very extensive.

Again, the results these scientists have seen ARE encouraging, but with such a small sample tested, isn't it a tad early to be boasting such victories just yet?"

2021-06-29 21:09:48,This article is pro vaccine propaganda. While the vaccines are remarkably effective up to a year out there is no empirical evidence that the immunity lasts more then a year as no one is a year out from initial vaccination. This article is an example of media boosterism for the vaccine- it undermines the veracity of vaccine effectiveness claims.
2021-06-29 21:38:20,The fact that they keep discovering things about these mRNA vaccines illustrates how much we have to learn about how they will interact with our bodies long term (or with the virus for that matter).

I read that immunity may be extensive and ongoing for those immunized with the Modena and Pfizer vaccines but then I read that even those vaccinated with the same are at risk for the Delta variant.  Should I wear a mask again?  Do I follow the lead of California that is recommending masks or of New York that isn’t?  Do I follow the CDC or the WHO?
2021-06-29 22:34:31,"I always thought that Pfizer was the best vaccine and yes, like any good vaccine it will protect you all along your life as long as there's no mutation.

Yet one more reason to support scientific across the board."
2021-06-29 22:38:32,"Vaccines have basically saved society as we know it. These vaccines could not have been developed, tested, and distributed without Big Pharma. Universities and government played essential roles, but the job would not have been possible without Big Pharma.

There are things not to like about major drug companies; the prices too often charged Americans (but usually not Canadians and Europeans) for essential medicines comes to mind.  But most drug companies and the vast majority of their employees are not motivated by greed, but rather to perform  a very important service.  By and large, they are on the side of the angels.

Today, drug companies face an existential threat which we must address: American tort lawyers.

Lawyers have filed literally tens of thousands of multibillion dollar lawsuits against drug companies, and win some. In a suit involving 22 patients, lawyers won over two billion dollars from J&J, over claims baby powder causes cancer.  The verdicts seem based on junk science and sympathetic juries, but this almost doesn't matter; these lawsuits can easily bankrupt companies we sorely need.

During the 1970's, lawsuits almost ended vaccine availability in the US; only a last minute no-fault bill passed by Congress in 1986 allowed vaccine production to continue.

There used to be an FDA-approved vaccine against Lyme disease; it is no longer sold, largely because of a class action lawsuit.

Congress needs to pass tort reform, and soon."
2021-06-29 22:41:29,"When I got vaccinated, there were only two choices, Moderna and Pfizer. They have turned out to be the state of the art. Lucky me."

It breaks my heart to see most of the world begging for vaccines, while they sit unused in warehouses here. 

And it boggles my mind that any holdouts in the USA aren’t lining up en masse to get vaccinated in the ever increasing spread of the extremely dangerous Delta covid-19 variant.

The Delta variant is estimated to be 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant it’s supplanting. And the Alpha variant was estimated to be 40-60% more infectious than the original covid-19 variant. Those are very sobering facts."

For the transactional-minded: helping others helps ourselves - it’s the only way to prevent covid from continuously circulating and mutating around the world for years to come.

Donating the vaccine to a country end on protecting the people of that country from the  virus. Helping people in time of need is regarded as the epitome of moral virtue and the highest kind of human excellence. The term diplomacy means carrying out a policy to outsmart others politically. To my mind, moral excellence and mundane tactics can't be  treated equal with one another. In the instant case I see no delay  in taking decision by the President  to donate the vaccine, which make the main weapon to fight with the pandemics and the  one hitherto played hell with  the American lives! Though it's not yet all up with! Leave alone 'Delta variant' plus 11 billion doses of vaccine necessary to cover the world populace, while only 03 billion so far administered; obviously the risk factor still lies uphill and around the corner! It behoves the President to tweak and turn comprehensively before taking 'give-away'! Forget not! He  laughs best, who laughs last (proverb)"

The world has changed and we must adapt.   The sooner we stop resisting the best science advice the sooner we can be at a healthier, safer world."
2021-06-30 10:37:38,"Not even half of this country is fully vaccinated.

The Delta variant has been gaining momentum since March.

Every medical professional I work with thought the discarding of wearing a face mask, even when fully vaccinated was a huge mistake and the lax precautions were reckless.

I understand why people are tried of these precautions.  Who isn't.  But the fact remains that the Delta variant isn't going away. And it is a very aggressive, highly contagious virus.

Please wear a mask. 

Please get vaccinated.

Lives truly are at risk.

Thank you."
2021-06-30 10:44:33,"Since COVID still enters the body (the vaccines only prevent a severe illness from COVID), I'm guessing it can also cause ""long-COVID"" meaning organ damage and brain fog.  So...I'll be the one on wearing a mask on the streets and when jogging around the reservoir!"
2021-06-30 10:45:00,"I am retired physician and immunocompromised .Mask  wearing ,hand washing and respectable distancing is the cheapest and probably the most effective way of prevention.For me it is my religion and for anyone who wants to  spend time with me.

2021-06-30 10:48:03,"I’m fully vaccinated so if I need to wear a mask, what is the point of getting vaccinated. If it’s to protect the unvaccinated who can’t get shots, they’re probably wearing masks to protect themselves. If the concern is about those who refuse to wear a mask, sorry, I have no sympathy for these people. Unless the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines aren’t effective against this variant or future more transmissible variants and except where required (medical facilities, for example), I don’t intend to wear a mask."
2021-06-30 10:52:20,Report the facts -- all the facts. Not just the ones that support your narrative. This fear mongering is getting out of hand. 321 new cases were confirmed in L.A. County yesterday. One in five (the statistic cited for the Delta variant) means approximately 64 cases  were Delta Variant. The population of L.A. County is 10 million+. Enough said.
2021-06-30 10:55:45,"I haven’t stopped wearing a mask indoors at places (grocery store, takeout at restaurants, pharmacy etc.) where people come in and out. Granted I don’t work at these types of establishments but the CDC advice seemed foolhardy. I’m pregnant, healthy, but given my pregnancy at higher risk of a break through infection, hospitalization and other more serious consequences should I contract Covid-19. We have a small, unvaccinated (due to ineligibility) child that I’d like to protect Wth available simple common-sense measures.

Wearing a mask indoors for sparing amounts of time (for the majority) is a minor inconvenience. While I too, am annoyed by those who are choosing not to be vaccinated— my actions are based on those who are medically vulnerable and/or ineligible."
2021-06-30 11:01:12,Why should I wear a mask and socially distance if I am fully immunized and it is highly improbable that I can spread the virus to others?
2021-06-30 11:05:18,"I went to a Costco without a mask yesterday and felt profoundly uncomfortable. It's back to masking indoors for me. I did mask up at the checkout counter out of courtesy to the staff (even those not masked).  I have been afraid to go back to in-person classes at the gym because exercise in a mask is simply not feasible for me. So it's still virtual for me.

People are confused by the conflicting information being put out by the CDC and the WHO. I think this can be attributed to the need of the CDC to balance health with politics and business/economy considerations, whereas the WHO is about health only. I'm putting my lot in with the WHO, because I honestly don't care about what big business wants."
2021-06-30 11:06:01,"The Delta Variant is very contageous and dangerous.  As a result, I think all people, even those vaccinated, should wear masks inside.  As for outside, no, unless you are at a pubic event like a baseball game or a fireworks display.  We need to stop the spread, and having a vaccination is NOT a guarantee you won't get (or spread) the delta variant."
2021-06-30 11:07:11,"It has to be asked: What has happened to critical thinking skills in this country?! 

We  know we are in the midst of a deadly pandemic.
We know that countries from Israel, to the UK, to Australia are having to lock down again.
We know that the new variant is significantly more infectious.
We think it may also be more deadly. 

What society, examining those knowns, doesn't take commonsense precautions like continuing to wear masks in public? What is so stunning about this is that these are not even hard things we're being asked to do! 

What we've witnessed is the infantilizing of a nation. Despite the word, that is not a benign act; it's a deadly trend. 

Wake up. Wear masks. Be ready to pivot again and do whatever it takes to end this pandemic. It's called acting like an adult.  If we honestly cannot do this, it's time to acknowledge we're a species in the throes of the kind of existential crisis that becomes a habitual inability to do triage and safeguard its own. And that is the kind of species not in it for the long haul. 
 
This IS a test. We continue to fail it inexplicably yet spectacularly."
2021-06-30 11:07:49,"If you look at Bell Curve closely, it has a tail end that continues, its nature's law empirically derived. The problem with this disease is that the tail end of the curve represents a significant number of unvaccinated people, where the virus finds a critical number of unvaccinated people as a mutation testbed and tests its mutation versions.
New mutations will continue to evolve, and I don't think we will be getting rid of masks, social distancing for quite a foreseeable future.
Let us all hope that a deadlier version of mutation does not appear, but then science tells us it is a matter of time."
2021-06-30 11:09:52,"Let's stop all the whining and moralizing.  If a person is at-risk, they should remain isolated and at home.  If a person feels uncomfortable not wearing a mask - then wear a mask.  However, for those of us who are healthy and vaccinated - let us choose where and when, if at all to wear a mask.  If you are vulnerable, it is your personal responsibility to protect yourself from the risk I may pose to you - not the other way around."
2021-06-30 11:20:22,"Since March 2020, until last month, I wore a mask religiously. I socially distanced for the entire pandemic and the minute a vaccine was available to me, I took it without question. Before doing so I assiduously followed The development of these vaccines and all of the concomitant risks and concerns. I continue to stay abreast of developments and conditions regarding COVID-19. I do this for myself and I do this for others. I am already aware that those who have been double innoculated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are at extremely minimal risk of contracting the delta variant.

Therefore, I have a little patience or sympathy in what will soon be July of 2021 for any adult who is still dragging his or her feet about getting vaccinated. Covid vaccines have become extremely widely available and can be acquired for free at most any large chain drugstore at a moments notice.

I have continued to wear masks at the supermarket and if I am going to be in any interior location where there are young children present. I am happy to keep doing this until kids are vaccinated. 

On the other hand, I am not going to swelter in a a face mask in 90 and 100° weather all summer or in my gym every day to accommodate irresponsible, foolish, and lazy people. If you have unvaccinated people in your home, or you won’t be vaccinated, at this stage of the pandemic, it is now on you to continue to wear masks and socially isolate to the degree that is appropriate to your individual circumstances."
2021-06-30 11:35:11,"Yesterday’s article on how the many variants develop, how quickly they develop, mutate, was….worrisome/educational/low-level, frightening. Alpha, beta, delta….this virus wont quit until it reaches Omega. And those unvaccinated, by choice, due to other illnesses, and even we who are fully vaccinated, risk allowing new variants, new mutations. 

Masks are hot, inconvenient. But I’m going with the WHO- for….a few more months. I’ve been on the fence as to mandating vaccinations. But more and more, I resent those who are able to get vaccinated and don’t (and that includes some family members). They endanger us all. Yes, these vaccines are experimental- we are the experiment subjects. But the alternative…is still much worse. And these variants, present and future, make it even more so. Keep the masks."
2021-06-30 11:35:30,NYC's re-opening is reckless and dangerous especially with the push for tourists to come back and with vaccines lagging. Our country once again has had advance notice and is ignoring what is happening in the likes of Great Britain and others who are being careful and shutting down as needed.   Sadly the U.S. values money and power over the lives of its citizens.
2021-06-30 11:36:38,"I find this kind of article unhelpful, have you ever been to India especially in New Delhi if the noise, crowds, incense, feci, poverty, etc….doesn’t get you the smells will. Point I’m trying to make is how can that area go from thousands of people dying from this variant to now something hospitals can control so you ask yourself why didn’t it wipe out more people why don’t the doctors know more. Do we have a new variant every time this virus goes through masses of people that are not vaccinated. If so then masks should be worn for the next five years for allergy sufferers and these variants just tell us what to expect."
2021-06-30 11:38:56,"We all need to wear masks right now. And hide under our beds, forever. And have DoorDash workers do all the work for us. And all pretend to work remotely.

2021-06-30 11:39:43,"This is simple-  
Viruses are inherently weak and can not survive on their own.
They need a host to continue to survive.
Each time they hop to a new host they have the opportunity to mutate.
Mutations are unpredictable. 
Viruses can mutate into something stronger and more resistant to vaccines and meds. (Think antibiotics)
Wearing masks is a one very simple way to keep the virus from finding hosts."

2021-06-30 11:42:37,"There are many immune compromised people who get reinfected, or for who the vaccine doesn't work well. What percentage are these people? I feel bad that they are so at risk. However, every person can't mask for life because of them."
2021-06-30 11:44:23,"I haven’t stopped wearing a mask indoors (actually two, to hopefully protect myself).

I have no doubt that there is a large overlap between the anti-mask crowd and the anti-vaccination crowd. I’m not willing to trust that all the strangers without masks are vaccinated or that they’ve spent the last year taking any precautions."
2021-06-30 11:46:20,"It does seem, now that I’ve been fully vaccinated and not been wearing a mask, that I still tend to distance myself if just by habit. Wearing a mask again in certain instances would now be much less onerous than it was initially. And I fully expect to now wear masks at times during the flu season, on airplanes etc. For instance we’ve seen what masking and social distancing did for the flu season last winter. Also who’s had a cold lately?"
2021-06-30 11:52:11,"We are told that immunized people are protected from the Delta variant. So, why the masks?  At this point, those who are not vaccinated have chosen to take all the risks associated with COVID-19, including the Delta variant. So, let them deal directly with the consequences of their own free choice."

2021-06-30 11:53:02,"Let me get this straight. Vaccinated people are supposed to go back to wearing masks, even though they are not getting significant symptoms even when infected, to guard against a theoretical risk that they could pass it to people who chose not to vaccinate? Good luck with that."
2021-06-30 11:56:35,I truly don’t understand why people are so adamant about not wearing masks. Is it really that big of a problem to wear a mask? I’m fully vaccinated but continue to wear my mask in public. My young children can’t be vaccinated yet and I will mask until they can be protected. If simply wearing a mask can save lives why are people so opposed to it?
2021-06-30 11:58:43,"Meanwhile in Massachusetts the moving 7 day average for Covid deaths is 2. New cases have been falling since April 11th and have been low for weeks. You have more chance being killed in a car wreck. If you are a healthy adult and haven’t been vaccinated by now, that’s your choice, but you have to live with the consequences. We must keep a close eye on the cases and deaths. However, we must get on with our lives. There are 9 deaths a day in Massachusetts during the regular flu season and we don’t do anything apart from offer flu jabs."

2021-06-30 12:01:39,"The Delta variant is at its peak in the UK.

Daily deaths have never passed 20.

At the peak of the pandemic it was 1,200.

The nation is mostly open, and vaccination rates are similar to the US.

I am begging - pleading - with the NYT and other media to put the Delta panic into perspective.

If you're in a well-vaccinated state, you don't need to go into reverse on Covid restrictions."
2021-06-30 12:02:39,"The problem with this recommendation is the fact that masking doesn't really work unless nearly everyone does it, or unless YOU personally wear a N95-type mask.

Remember the ""my mask protects you, your mask protects me"" ads?

Regular masks do little in an indoor environment where perhaps 60% at most are wearing them. They work great when everyone is wearing them, but in the US that ship sailed long ago.

My fear is that reviving this issue this will lead to resumption of mandates and then to further political ferment. Perhaps better to really work on vaccination."
2021-06-30 12:03:38,"Either vaccines work or they don’t. 
If I’ve been vaccinated how am I contagious? If being vaccinated doesn’t change my risk of being contagious and infected, then why did I let Pfizer shoot chemicals into my body? 
Measles is a highly infectious virus spread by respiratory droplets. I’ve been vaccinated for it (twice actually, but that’s another story) and am not required to wear a mask to prevent me from magically carrying, spreading or being infected by measles, so why am I supposed to wear a mask because of Covid?
I’m vaccinated and that means I can’t carry it or catch it. If that’s not what being vaccinated means then why are we getting vaccinated?"
2021-06-30 12:10:04,"Yesterday at the health food store, I (fully vaccinated) went in without a mask because the sign requiring it was no longer up. Inside I saw several other people without masks (including employees), several people with regular masks, several people with K95 masks, and one woman with mask, goggles, and gloves.

I am at this point utterly confused. I want to do what’s right but at the same time am not even sure what what that is. I live in a mostly unvaccinated state where most people, vaccinated or not, don’t wear masks. 

This is what the completely inconsistent messaging from Day 1 has created."
2021-06-30 12:12:02,"I'm all for herd immunity, which is why I got vaccinated. In fact, any sensible person should know that ""back to normal"" really requires GLOBAL herd immunity. Based on the slow vaccine rollout in many countries, I understand the concern voiced by the WHO. That said, the notion that vaccinated people should mask up to protect anti-vaxxers is preposterous--placating senseless rebellion will not get us an inch closer to herd immunity."
2021-06-30 12:23:10,"I was told getting vaccinated was all I needed to do. 

Welp, I'm done with the masks and the lockdown orders. America isn't a perpetual lockdown/mask mandate machine. America has mentally moved on.

Compromised? Stay home.

Here comes the next rush of Californians into Arizona like when 25% of every license plate was from there after Newsome shut the state down. People escaping to freedom.

Wear your mask. I threw mine away after the vaccine."
2021-06-30 12:28:00,No thanks.  The COVID industrial complex has run its course.  Time to live life.
2021-06-30 12:35:16,"The longer we drag this on, the more likely we are to keep seeing new deadlier and more contagious variants. Get vaccinated and wear a mask if you want to keep doing fun things. The virus needs bodies in which to mutate and create these new forms. The more we get vaccinated and wear masks, the less opportunity we give it to do so and the more we can enjoy our lives. Covid doesn’t go away just becuase you are tired of it."
2021-06-30 12:35:57,"The CDC made a very hasty decision regarding masks. There was no reason to drop mask wearing indoors in public spaces when it is impossible to tell who is and who is not vaccinated. It has given the unvaccinated a license to stop wearing a mask and yet not get vaccinated. My experience has been that more people in my area continue wearing masks than not, but then NM was a state with an early mask mandate and it may be that people are just used to wearing a mask now. I know I have no intention of giving up my KF94 in indoor spaces anytime soon, possibly forever. Throughout the vast majority of the pandemic we’ve been on our own when it comes to protection. Masks are not burdensome and are a prudent choice. It is still not known how long vaccination protection lasts. It’s not known if the vaccinated spread the virus or not. It is not known if a vaccinated person who gets a mild or asymptomatic case can become a long hauler or not. There are just too many unknowns. I’m of the mindset that I don’t care if others want to pretend the pandemic is completely behind us. I don’t believe it is and I’m going to continue to act accordingly no matter what others choose to do."

2021-06-30 12:40:26,"See statistics, the summer is there, contamination is lower than ever, very hot weather and sun make very uncomfortable wearing a mask outside or inside.

You should trust more the vaccine than masks, because this is the vaccine (combined with Ultraviolet (UV) who stopped the pandemy, quarantines and masks failed to erase the virus or protect against any new variant.

if you impose masks to vaccinated people they won't trust anymore in vaccination, this is surely not the thing to do.

The priority is vaccination, because even if you catch the virus while vaccinated the effect won't be deadly unless you're already ill of soemthing else with a weak health."
2021-06-30 12:43:34,So many comments here saying the CDC should not have changed their masking guidance. What happened to trusting the experts?
2021-06-30 12:44:22,"NY Times not too long ago reported that break through cases happen all the time. People with vaccination sometime still get infections.  There were more than 10,000 cases till April this year. But vaccines do reduce hospitalization and death rates. Thus, CDC stopped recording the break trough cases.

Not until we reach 70~75% that is necessary to reach herd immunity, the chances we get infection again is still high especially with the Delta Variant.

I still think precaution and prevention is more important than treatment afterwards."
2021-06-30 12:02:03,"“... Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, vice president for global initiative at the University of Pennsylvania, said the arrival of the variant should prompt a rethinking of mask mandates.

He still wears a mask indoors in public places like grocery stores, and even on crowded city sidewalks. ‘We don’t know the long-term consequences of even a mild infection,’ he said, referring to so-called long Covid. ‘Is a little more insurance from wearing a mask worth it? Yes.’ ...”

Zeke, brother of Rahm, is & always has been prudent in his approach to how an average person should interface with the modern healthcare system in this country. It was right for the authors of this piece to incorporate his words & advice, as quoted, into the bottom-line message of their reporting.

This pandemic is not over! It will not be over until the virus has no accessible reservoir of humanity left to infect; that is, when we reach the point of true “herd immunity” by the #’s. This concept is a matter of fact not wishful thinking. CDC recommendations a few months ago vis a vis unmasking & limited reopening were premature, just as I feared when issued. Factual reality has once again proven a value for continued masking & distancing. 

SARS-CoV-2 prevails as a mutating, immovable object arrayed against human impatience & intransigence as the irresistible force. No contest. This insensate, apolitical virus will never lose against self-serving human frivolity. Vaccinate(!) & mask up until this pandemic is really over!"

2021-06-30 12:15:15,"At this point in the pandemic, if folks have chosen not to be vaccinated then they shouldn't be admitted into a hospital if/when they get Covid. The rest of us who've done our part to protect fellow Americans, and are taxpayers shouldn't get stuck paying any portion of their hospital bills because there is no fixing their level of selfishness and stupidity."

2021-06-30 12:46:38,"I’m so tired of hearing about Delta. We knew from the beginning that vaccines don’t always prevent infection, but they do prevent serious illness and death. Cases are rising in the UK but guess what? The deaths aren’t. Because the vaccines work. This feels like another ploy for news publications to get clicks rather than it being something of genuine concern."
2021-06-30 12:54:12,"My simple answer to this is: No, I'm not going to wear a mask again!

Our family is vaccinated.  That's all we can do and it's all we're going to do.  This is going to sound harsh, but I'm going to say it anyway.  There is plenty of vaccine available, and if you've chosen not to get vaccinated, I don't care if I pass the virus to you!  I really don't."
2021-06-30 12:55:39,"I don't understand why this is still a concern.  This seems like hysteria.  The vaccines protect against serious illness and death. 

Let's be real - if you're under 60 and healthy, the chances of serious illness or death were already VERY low, before the vaccines. 

We'll never completely get rid of covid.  The best we can do is prevent serious illness and death.  Anything else is unrealistic and promulgates fear and unnecessary restrictions. 

I don't see the problem here.  As far as I'm concerned, the pandemic is over in the USA."
2021-06-30 13:00:27,"Where I live there are plenty of folks willing to let strangers sicken and die because their imaginary sky gods will sort it all out afterwards.
Not having an imaginary sky god, despite having been vaccinated, I'll wear a mask and avoid the deluded. There are worse forms of contagion than Covid-19."
2021-06-30 13:00:31,"The CDC,  motivated by the ulterior motive to induce Americans to get vaccinated, has put ""masks off"" as a carrot on the plate of Americans hungry to resume normal lives.  

Most members of the medical profession, including immunologists,  know little about the intrinsic character of SARS-CoV-2, which I bet the DOD believes, with cause, is an engineered bio weapon.  There are a few bio-scientists who  do understand this is a 21st Century bio weapon designed to evade defeat, and expect future variants to emerge that will be more easily spread and more lethal than the Delta variant.  

These scientists get the solution will not be provided by 20th C. tweaked antibody immunology platforms, but by 21st C. targeted killer T-cell platforms that will not merely block spike proteins, but will penetrate the cover of the spike protein to reside in a static target inside to continue to engage killer T-cells that will continue to defeat SARS-CoV-2 in its constant state of mutation.

So how can journalists or the public not be confused, as well as suffer from vaccine-Covid angst, in a state of ""masks off"" denial and avoidance.  As a life long sailor on the great lakes, I am familiar a lull before a violent storm hits.

It is important to think critically about what the result of ""masks off"" can objectively be anticipated to be in 3 to 4 months, when retrospectively it will be possible to conclude this was a national spreading event.   Localized - really?"
2021-06-30 13:03:53,"This is a test of my willingness to help the ignorant.   The long and the short of is that vaccinated people such as myself will be donning masks to a) protect those who don't want to get vaccinated and b) because the unvaccinated aren't wearing masks, thus spreading the virus (if everyone wears a mask, problem solved, at my expense).
Truthfully, I am not sure sure how I feel about protecting nitwits.  The exception might be that it protects children, but I don't think this is why masks would be required."
2021-06-30 13:04:29,"I know many people who died from covid and I was all for masks and precautions all along, but at this point it's simply overkill. Read the fine print and science to see that the risk to vaccinated individuals from Delta is minute and speculative at best. Will we all keep wearing masks forever to avoid a tiny risk for which we don't take similar levels of precautions in any other case? Enough with the masks and the hype, unless a real and clearcut risk and danger returns."
2021-06-30 13:04:37,"Those who are still willfully unvaccinated have chosen to take the risk of illness and possible death.  They should have to pay higher medical insurance premiums, just like smokers."
2021-06-30 13:06:44,The WHO also just recommended we don’t vaccinate children. Perhaps at this point we all can make our own assessments.
2021-06-30 13:25:22,"So essentially, we are being asked- or told- to wear masks indoors because people who have not been vaccinated- of their own volition- are at risk. The words "" too bad, get smarter "" come to mind. If I am not at risk because I and my family choose to be vaccinated while others didn't and exercise risk behavior, it's time to say- enough. These are adults, they make choices, they want to die, pass it along , get seriously ill- this is America, that's their choice - we made ours, they made theirs, life -or not - goes on. Enough is enough. We have shown the efficacy of the vaccines, shown the downside, offered this vaccine for free."
2021-06-30 13:27:46,"It's irresponsible to ask people to wear masks after they've been vaccinated.  The simple reason is that nobody is going to do it anyway.  People have done what they can do, and they can do no more.  We're not going to wear masks the rest of our lives.  It's time to open up and go back to normal and those who haven't been vaccinated need to bet vaccinated or be at risk.

To 'A' below, get real!  There's a small risk any person could die from the behavior of some dude in the outback that passes some undetectable pathogen that effects only maybe 100 people in the world due to a genetic predisposition.  Should we all cower in our homes and wear HAZMAT suits because there's a small risk?

It's ridiculous.  Somebody needs to put the foot down and shock us back into the reality that all life carries risk.  Everyone is at risk of dying every single day.  That's life."
2021-06-30 13:28:02,I'm fully vaccinated. I've done my part. I'm NOT going back.
2021-06-30 13:30:30,"I think an uptick in cases is likely in the fall, just like there was last year. 

But the vaccination rate in my state is 70%; if cases start ticking up significantly here, that means that breakthrough cases are really becoming an issue. If that happens, then I'll absolutely starting masking again. Until that happens? I'm good."
2021-06-30 13:33:13,"I'm really disturbed by people commenting here. Seems a lot think you have a choice: get vaccinated or don't. Children can't be vaccinated. Some adults can't. Some adults don't develop antibodies.
I am vaccinated, but immunocompromised, didn't develop antibodies. Now I'm more fearful of going out than six months ago. Then we were largely in this together. Now we're all on our own. The unmasked and unvaccinated are the biggest threat, but the unmasked and vaccinated are still a small threat. And I can't tell the difference.
Just wear a mask. They're a minor inconvenience."
2021-06-30 13:37:44,"Mask mandates are not punishment for being bad actors. They are to keep us safe. Scientists and doctors are the messengers. The anger directed at people who are reporting the facts and managing an unpredictable and mutating virus is misdirected and consequential. We're all tired and fed-up but refusing to wear a mask just because we already did that is at our own peril. We can do this - buck up, wear a mask and take care of yourself and others."
2021-06-30 13:41:21,"I am a liberal democrat. I wore my mask, I stayed home, I only got together with friends if it was outside and we stayed distant. I kept doing that even after I was fully vaccinated even though I thought it was silly because I know the science. Not only am I safe, I can’t give it to others either. Seriously, what am I doing by wearing a mask other than wasting money and giving myself skin rashes and acne? Literally nothing. Period. But still, just in case I kept masking. I know evidence can change the details - especially when we have more of it. But then we got more evidence - a bigger pool of people who were vaccinated - and the CDC concluded masks were no longer useful and that was enough for me. I’m not going to start masking up again, not even at work where they’re trying to require it. I am not going to stop getting together with my friends indoors. I am not going to stop going out to eat and drink. I’m so completely over it."
2021-06-30 13:44:12,"Even a year and a half later, I don't understand at all why people object to such a small thing as wearing a mask. I'm finally about to get my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine next week, after waiting patiently through our rollout and prioritization of vulnerable groups, slowed by limited vaccine supply in the early months. I have been separated for eighteen months from my partner, who is caregiving for a parent in Europe, so believe me the wait has been grueling. I am grateful and thrilled to be getting my second dose - thank you to science and public health, and now loosened export restrictions, providing us with sufficient supply north of the border - but will continue to wear a mask in enclosed spaces for the foreseeable future. It's such a small thing that I can do for others, full stop. I really just don't understand why this is even a debate."
2021-06-30 13:46:35,"If you are vaccinated and basically healthy your odds of ""breakthrough infection"" are low and will almost certainly be totally asymptomatic or so mild as to make no difference. Moreover you are highly unlikely to spread the disease even the new variants. 

Going into a panic and reinstituting mask mandates as LA County is doing undermines credibility and accomplishes nothing.

Far better to just keep people informed and remind those who are very elderly or have compromised immune systems that even if vaccinated a mask is prudent indoors for that particular group. 

Life is not a zero risk game. If my risk = low chance of an infection that I most likely won't even know I have that will do me no harm and is highly unlikely to be passed to others...

I'm not wearing that thing on my face in 100 degree heat. 

Period."
2021-06-30 13:46:58,"Masks were the LEAST oppressive part of this pandemic.  

I got no colds, no flu, and no COVID.

The only reason people are opposing masks and vaccines is because they hate the thinking half of the country that is willing to endure a minimal amount of discomfort for themselves, their families, and for the community.

Preventative measures and vaccines were a gift that saved lives. 

I almost root for the virus to become more deadly to the anti-vaccine, anti-mask crowd.   These stubborn, selfish people are wrecking everything for everyone else.  There's more than one way to get to herd immunity."
2021-06-30 13:48:05,"Cases are not hospitalizations, which aren’t rising

Nor are deaths

It’s been clear from the UK then SA now Delta variant that the experts were itching to reimpose restrictions"
2021-06-30 13:50:34,Everyone in the comments is a huge baby. Just put the mask on when you go into a store or other indoor place. Is it really that big of a deal? Nobody is saying you need to stop going out to eat or any of the other precious activities you do. Get over yourselves.
2021-06-30 13:51:33,"We are all done and ready to move on from Covid but Covid is not done with us yet. We have a choice, either we play the hand we’re dealt and let common sense and compassion prevail and adapt to evolving circumstances or dig our heels in and decide to ignore the circumstances and pay the price for our actions. 

From the beginning it was thought that this would last every bit of 18 months, which takes us to September-ish. 

We’re all tired. We’re all frustrated. But we’re almost there."
2021-06-30 13:55:43,"Done with masks here in Florida. Fully vaccinated and comfortable everywhere without a mask. If you follow scientific evidence, chances of anything serious from the Delta are less of anything serious from a flu to a vaccinated person. Don't care about that risk.

Chances of mask mandates happening again in the vast majority of US are zero. Mainly because infections.might go up, but not deaths. Get vaccinated and live your life. No need to fear monger."
2021-06-30 13:56:31,I’m not wearing a mask to protect people who oppose vaccines.  This is nature’s way of removing people who are a threat to our population.
2021-06-30 13:56:36,"Wearing a mask is so trivial.  Staying home, closing businesses, never seeing anyone - those are serious, and need to be seriously considered before re-imposing those rules.  But masks?  A scrap of fabric on your face?  Get over it.

Of course, if everyone who can would just get vaccinated, we wouldn't need to, but that isn't the case yet."
2021-06-30 13:56:39,"As someone who received the moderna vaccines in Mach/April, I will continue to pay attention to the infection rate on a near daily basis.  If the numbers jump significantly in my area I will return to wearing the mask until the numbers decline again.  A friend in Scottsdale, Az. fell ill with the virus on January 2nd.  It wasn't until  some time in May that he no longer needed a home oxygen supply.  He experienced afib and has since had a pacemaker implanted.  I don't think he will ever truly experience normality again.  Early on, his words to me were - you don't want to get this."
2021-06-30 14:02:10,"I've been vaccinated for some time now and I live in a part of the country where vaccine compliance is high and Covid-19 infection rates are low and dropping. That said I have not and do not intend to stop wearing my masks (doubled disposable surgical masks) in any situation where infection is possible for as long as I need to share the nation with people who shirk their civic duty and willfully refuse to be vaccinated and to mask themselves. 

When someone asks me why I simply say that I am ""Chicken"".  That comment disarms them in most cases. 

In the rare occasion when I encounter a genuine red state pandemic denier (a rare and endangered species in deep blue Western Massachusetts) I simply let them have their say (from a safe distance) secure in the knowledge that ""you can't fix stupid"" and that they are likely self selecting to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 Delta varient and if it proves fatal taken out of the gene pool and off the registered voters lists.   This is simply natural selection at work (something else most of these folks don't believe in)."
2021-06-30 14:02:14,"The Times published a survey a couple of months ago where the political divide on this matter was clear: people who identify as Dems way overestimated the likelihood that a person would be hospitalized with Covid whereas those who identify as Repubs actually were closer to the mark (it pains me to say this!).  I""m convinced at least part of the argument in favor of masks here and elsewhere is political ""virtue signaling"".  In other words, people add a lot of other ""reasons"" into their risk assessment.  Example: I keep hearing how masks helped prevent colds and flus during the season but was it mask wearing during one's probably brief foray into a grocery store that prevented these common ailments or was it the fact that people were working from home, not commuting via crowded public transport (BART in the Bay Area), traveling in plans?  That reality seems more likely to me, not the masks."
2021-06-30 14:07:19,"Once I read about the ABI (Acquired Brain Injury) symptoms of those with so called ""mild cases"" when the C.D.C.'s advisements only are about severe cases leading to hospitalization and deaths, I bought more masks which are more abundant and lower priced than before. I also felt betrayed as a health vulnerable older adult that government officials did not keep masking by all mandates at public essential services places like grocery stores. If anyone talks about their masking up or not with me I just say ""that's so  Republican"" miserable inside that Americans couldn't unite and rally around  wearing a piece of cloth to protect themselves, if not others, against a long term disabling disease.and don't care especially about their unvaccinated children under 12 to continue to do so."
2021-06-30 14:08:38,The mask ship has sailed.
2021-06-30 14:14:27,"As a vaccinated person, I wear a mask not only to protect myself a little bit more but also to help reinforce the idea that it's normal. So few people wear a mask in my community-- I'm concerned that those who need to won't because they don't want to stand out.

Reestablishing the norm of mask wearing willl be especially important this fall at the rural university where I work. I imagine that many students won't have had the vaccine. I anticipate that we'll have many cases of the delta variant, which will disrupt our plans to return to normal."
2021-06-30 14:15:45,WHO and CDC have lost a lot of credibility. Should never have said take off masks once vaccinated in the first place. Way too late to put that horse back in the barn.
2021-06-30 14:16:13,"We wouldn’t be facing questions about masking if everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated got vaccinated.  Then we would truly be back to normal, or very nearly so.  As it stands, we are at the mercy of the anti-vaxxers, as we are the anti-maskers.

A question:  How much possible harm can someone wearing a mask cause?  Answer: none.  And how much possible harm can someone not wearing a mask cause?  Answer: sickness and death for themselves and others, and perpetuation of the pandemic.  So it’s those who aren’t wearing a mask who should have to justify themselves, not those who are wearing them."
2021-06-30 14:18:19,"In my state, Vermont, the vast majority diligently followed COVID guidelines. We socially distanced, we wore masks everywhere, even outdoors, we got vaccinated as soon as we could. Our leadership followed the science. Because of all this, our cases, hospitalizations, and deaths remained low. Now, over 80% of eligible residents are at least partly vaccinated, our daily statewide case count is in the single digits, and, yes, we finally are taking off our masks in the summer heat and resuming a life much closer to normal. Unless something changes that would warrant a return to extra precautions (a variant that renders the vaccines ineffective, for example, a surge in new infections and hospitalizations) people here are rewarding themselves for doing the right thing. We’ll listen to our state recommendations and Dr. Fauci and carry on. Of course anyone who feels safer wearing a mask and taking other precautions should be free to do so. And under-vaccinated areas of the US should follow the science that applies to them. The mixed and hyperbolic messaging about the effectiveness of vaccines is not the best way to incentivize the holdouts."
2021-06-30 12:58:42,No. Done with it.
2021-06-30 13:10:29,The girl is that photo is stunning.  Hope she’s got her vaccine!
2021-06-30 13:50:40,There are 10 million people in LA county and there were 250 new cases of COVID on average per day in the last week.    You better mask up!
2021-06-30 14:11:15,"I just don’t think this is a smart strategy. The goal is to get more people vaccinated. If certain people (you know the type of people I’m talking about) hear that they have to keep wearing a mask anyway, many won’t get vaccinated. 

We have less than 40 percent vaccinated in my county. Will they get vaccinated? The vaccines are free and widely available, so I don’t understand what the problem is. Oh wait, yes I do. Ignorance: ignorance is the problem. We have to walk on eggshells to keep from upsetting these people simply because they are too ignorant to get vaccinated. Variants will take root and we’ll still be dealing with a pandemic this time next year. Though I’ve been vaccinated since early May, I’m still too scared to go in large stores because I know that most of the people inside aren’t vaccinated. 

How do you get the Deep South vaccinated? You tell people that college football season will be canceled if they don’t get vaccinated. You go on Fox News and Newsmax and tell these people that variants could emerge that evade the vaccine and upend college football season. I’ve concluded that this is the only way to get through to these knuckleheads."
2021-06-30 14:22:09,"soon covid19 will be known in the usa as the trump virus, as only trump supporters (and uneducated- often the same crowd) will need hospitalization from it.  i just hope that they have private insurance."
2021-06-30 14:23:57,"In the US there is now enough vaccine that not being vaccinated is an active choice.

If you're not vaccinated you are at risk...and that is completely your choice. That's what you wanted, isn't it? 

And I've stopped masking because I feel no obligation to protect those who have chosen not to take a simple step to protect themselves."
2021-06-30 14:24:17,"I’m fully vaxed and gladly don my very comfortable and well designed KN95 mask (with changeable filters) in most stores. Doesn’t bother me one bit. If I see someone I know I’ll take it off to talk, provided they don’t appear ill.

My young kids play with other young kids, indoors and outdoors.  It’s a risk I’m willing to take because masking is robbing them of their youth and innocence at this point.  They need to see other kids expressions particularly a smile. They’ve already been scarred enough from the pandemic.

Still don’t go to crowded indoor restaurants and events but happy to sit on a patio with anybody who has their shots.  Anti-Vaxers really anger me.   I’m looking forward to seeing my first live concert with 2019 in the fall.  

Navigating the maze of covid safety is a little complicated at this stage. My sense is by the end of the summer science will have more answers and all restrictions will be a memory but indoor masks will stick around for a while so people don’t catch other respiratory illnesses. Not in social gatherings but in public places.

I’m neither Dem nor Rep but usually support the GOP.  DeSantis is probably my favorite politician at the moment and I don’t live in Florida."

MA is about 90%vaccinated but the delta variant and my lack of trust in my fellow beings make me cautious. As in the picture, I wear a medical mask under a three layer cloth mask."
2021-06-30 14:28:15,"I'm vaccinated, but when I am indoors, I wear a mask. I do that because not everyone can be vaccinated.

However, once everyone, including children, has access to the vaccine, I will not be wearing a mask when not in very high risk situations, e.g., on a train or plane. Quite simply, I am not going to subsidize those who are too foolish or selfish to get vaccinated.

I am concerned about those who can't be vaccinated for a medical reason, but the real risk for them is people who don't get vaccinated. If not for them, we could wipe this disease out almost overnight, and life could go back to normal.

Their behavior is shameful."

Three had received the Pfizer vaccination quite a while back.

All had had Covid earlier on in the pandemic.

Three of the four work together.

The fourth is a baby (she’s doing just fine, the others are feeling “better”.)

11 days after the first positive Delta result, at least one is still testing positive.

All were much sicker than the last bout with Covid.

After inquiring about everyone’s health, I asked why there’s almost no discussion in the news about reinfection (there’s a bit today).

If reinfection is so “rare”, why am I aware of three?

There are a lot of people visiting this city and traveling back to a home near you - every single day.

So, now what do we do?  There are a lot of letters between Delta and Omega…"

2021-06-30 14:45:34,"The CDC has walked back recommendations before especially under political pressure or as a result of changing science. I have been fully vaccinated with Pfizer and continue to wear my mask except at home until we know how the Delta variant plays out coupled with the fact that far too many people have not been vaccinated or have received only a single shot and act as incubators for variants. As of midnight last night Governor Inslee here in Washington lifted all masking requirements, heaven help us. I am ashamed of my fellow Americans who refuse vaccination and consider wearing a mask such a great personal burden."
2021-06-30 14:57:42,"It's maddening that certain scientists and health officials make statements regarding peoples reticence towards mask wearing. The science must be solely concerned with the proper thing to do to curb the virus, no matter how the public might react. Because if there's one thing that matters it's that we must all trust in the objectivity of science and not the subjectivity of politicians, business owners, and numerous others. This is not to say that the scientists and health care officials ought to bury their heads in the sand regarding the public's reactions. On the contrary, I think it was bone headed of the CDC to say that fully vaccinated people could cease wearing a mask. That statement opened a door that is difficult to shut. The CDC should have simply stated that fully vaccinated people were well protected. Then let others, Mayors, Governors, etc, modify any rules re mask wearing."

2021-06-30 15:07:43,"I mean, I suppose it comes down to what the goals are, doesn't it? Is the goal to have absolutely zero spread, ever? If so, we'd have to gird ourselves to the idea of permanent masking. Obviously that's unrealistic, and a slippery slope. Is the goal to maintain adequate hospital beds, etc to care for those who have the most serious reactions to the virus - as was the rationale so many months ago? Well, have we done that yet? I'd like more reporting that gives us this information. We need a very clear explanation of just what we are trying to do here."
2021-06-30 15:10:05,"I’m just incredulous that people make such a fuss about being asked to wear masks. What a bunch of babies! 

I’m fully vaxxed and routinely wear my mask in stores etc. on the basis that if I can do anything with even the remotest chance of helping an immunocompromised person or kid, then I’m going to do it. Not hosting a happily mutating virus is an added incentive. It’s just not a big deal to do it.

Grow up, America."
2021-06-30 15:16:23,"We have not stopped masking since becoming fully vaccinated in March.  This is for the same reason as our starting masking within a week of the pandemic being recognized, it protects others.  May people have  a less than robust response  to the vaccine and remain vulnerable despite their best efforts. There is a (small) chance of the vaccinated becoming infectious with no symptoms, it would be immoral for me to take even the slightest chance with others.  Additionally we only have hard evidence on the known variants, and more will come and might be different enough to overcome the vaccine."
2021-06-30 15:24:13,"I’m a retired physician and vaccinated as
well and have come to the same conclusion."
2021-06-30 15:24:38,"For those who buy into this misplaced ""logic"" about mask wearing the result is we should never stop wearing masks ever because Covid-19 will always be out there in one form or another and we will never reach a point when everyone is vaccinated. Therefore keeping our communities and nation in a never ending state of emergency and unable to return to normal. Not now not later this year not ever.

This so called ""logic"" also strongly implies that these vaccines we have all been assured are very effective is not true. What these experts who want us to keep wearing masks have done is trap themselves and all of us in a vicious circle that makes no sense.

The truth is what it has always been those who refuse to be vaccinated are at risk not those of us who have been vaccinated and we have no  necessary reason to wear masks. Period. 

Those who are not been vaccinated logically should always wear masks. And those who are vaccinated who want to wear masks can also do so.

For the rest of us its masks OFF and time to bring our city and nation back to normal. Stop listening to the ""always maskers."""
2021-06-30 15:26:45,Glad to hear that vaccinated individuals are resistant to the Delta variant - think our luck will hold down through Omega? I'm not holding my breath. I'm going to do everything I can personally to keep the spread at a minimum and I hope to God that this administration does everything in its power to make it absolutely painful to be unvaccinated in this country.
2021-06-30 15:27:18,"I have not suffered from a cold or the flu for over a year now.  Hence, I will always wear a mask when I am around lots of people in an enclosed space---stores, crowded sidewalks and such."
2021-06-30 15:31:10,"To the commenters who have “done their part” by masking up in the past and have gotten vaccinated, saying Covid is no longer their problem - especially for those who won’t get shots:

Do you think you are any better than all the anti-masksers we have had since the pandemic began?

Yes, it is frustrating that many do want to be vaccinated. But it doesn’t mean I want them to get very ill or die, let alone possibly indirectly play a role in filling up hospitals, thus repeating a cycle we had last year: traumatized and burnt out medical professionals, and those who do need other medical help reluctant to seek the care they need. 

What about those with compromised immune systems who can’t get shots? Or those of age, as the NYTimes covered, who have family preventing them from getting vaccinated? Children who can then spread to adults? There are so many people out there who can suffer, because of the choices you make - not just the choices they make for themselves. 

It’s mental gymnastics. The amount of faith so many politicians and people have put in the CDC is astounding - how many mistakes have they made in the past year? How many times have they flip-flopped and kowtowed because it fits the “thinking” that so many want to hear?

Trump was our President. Surely since he was an “authority,” so many more should have just blindly trusted him?

A lot of us have mostly worn masks for over a year now. A few more months if we act now can’t hurt. I’d like to think it can HELP."
2021-06-30 15:34:34,"We are at a point in public policy where the risk/reward tradeoffs have become more difficult. What is the obligation of vaccinated people to protect those who refuse to get vaccinated? To protect those who are immunocompromised and would have benefited from mask mandates even before COVID? What steps should we take to shield children under 12 from risk? These are issues that scientists cannot provide definitive answers to: for better or worse, this is the job of our elected representatives and their advisors. This article would help judge the relative risks better if it shared more scientific data behind the tradeoffs as they stand now. Let's see more numbers."
2021-06-30 15:35:04,Just do it. Just put on a mask. It also seems some of the anti maskers would be more appealing with a mask on.
2021-06-30 15:37:30,"The pandemic is far from over.   As much as we would like it to be, it is not.

We have all those who refused to follow basic safety protocols to ""thank"" 🙄.

True, guidance from health authorities has at times been confusing but wearing a mask has been advised for quite a while. 

We who wear masks and take precautions have made it possible for the no maskers, anti vaxxers to go around bare faced and behave like nothing is threatening our health. 

I don't want them to thank us.  I would like them to put on a mask at the very least.

My city requires unvaccinated persons to wear masks, but we are on the honor system, which is a joke. The city says that less than half of the population is vaccinated, but most people don't wear masks.

Hey, to each his or her own.  But I must confess, both the dog and cat looked at me with such sorrowful eyes, as if they were saying ""Hey lady, this wasn't my idea.  Please help me and take off my mask""."

2021-06-30 15:46:49,"The big picture if you are vaccinated and living in a state/county with a high vaccination rate is that studies show the overwhelming majority of break-through infections (after vaccination) are caused by variants.  The Delta variant will soon mutate into something else.  As long as there is a pool for this opportunistic virus to infect and replicate in, there is a good change of further mutation.  We do not know if future mutant strains will be contained by current vaccines.  I am vaccinated and I am wearing my mask in public indoor spaces.  I might be a few months early, but might as well keep the habit going.  This thing is in no way over. One more thing:  why are we permitting international travel?"

There’s “news” making rounds, largely in conservative circles (ron paul tweeted about it) that a UK study showed the delta variant is far less deadly though more transmissible. 

The reports are based on a June 18 report published by Public Health England, and titled “SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England
Technical briefing 16”.  The data is on table 2. Not sure what to make of this and hoping the NYT can help."
2021-06-30 15:48:06,It’s time for Biden to impose a mandate for vaccination. The vaccine hesitancy and not wearing masks because of “freedom” and all that nonsense is cute. But it’s time to get real people. Pay your taxes and get your vaccine shot. It’s the law.
2021-06-30 16:14:11,"""Some scientists agreed, but urged a localized approach.""

It is obvious that the new Delta variant know no boundaries with whom or where to infect in the world. Why are some scientist in favor of a 'local approach' especially in those local areas who's rights and personal freedoms are in jeopardy of being taken away, rather than spreading a medical concern during a pandemic.

“We don’t want to return to lockdown or more disruptive mandates here,” Dr. Ferrer said. “We want to stay on the path we’re on right now, which is keeping community transmission really low.”

And will add, what about the global traveling markets of people -  air land and sea. 

Have my two Gate Chips and still where a mask in the markets because out of 330 mil Americans, only 34.5 million have been confirmed; leaves about 298 million who have never caught the disease...and how many of these have not been inoculated today?  There is also no guarantee my two Gate Chips will last longer than 6 months.

Waiting patiently for the fall flu/virus program to start here after all the summer tourism come back home to start school again. Already business/schools governments are talking Mandatory Vaccination ....why buy local policy...and not federal policy? Delta cares not who implements the program; we only care that it is implemented all across the country and to those coming and leaving."

2021-06-30 16:27:40,"What Los Angeles has done is irresponsible, because it undermines already shaky public confidence in both national and local public health authorities. It's crying wolf, and when the real wolf comes people won't know what to do. And it ignores everything that scientists (of whom I'm aware say): if you're vaccinated you have a very small chance of contracting COVID at all, and if you do it won't be severe, and you have no chance of transmitting it. So the message Los Angeles SHOULD be sending is: If you're not vaccinated you should wear a mask; if you're vaccinated there's no reason to do so. And if THAT is too hard for people to understand, they shouldn't be walking around. The Los Angeles announcement is likely to reduce the incentive for people to get vaccinated, because they're essentially saying it doesn't matter."
2021-06-30 16:27:46,"The CDC prematurely rolled out guidelines saying that unvaccinated people didn't need to wear masks indoors anymore, regardless of the vaccination status of others. The WHO and LA County guidelines are much more protective and conducive to stopping the continued spread of Covid. My family and I are fully vaccinated and we are continuing to wear masks indoors unless we are with a small group that we know is also fully vaccinated. At this point, there is no clarity from the scientists about the likelihood of vaccinated people contracting long Covid from a mild or asymptomatic infection, so we don't want to take that risk. We also don't want to risk being an unwitting transmitter of the disease to others who cannot get vaccinated or who don't have a strong immune response."

Look at what COVID-19 has done. It's forced us to be hermits for a year, killed and infected millions of people, and seriously damaged the economy. We can put a stop to all of it simply by driving to the nearest Walgreen's and having a needle stuck in our arms. Let all the January 6 freedom eagles scream and the conspiracy theorists type furiously in their blogs. And then sock them with a $10,000 fine for endangering their fellow human beings if they don't get a lousy shot. Drastic times, drastic measures. Let's get it done and kiss their boo-boos later."
2021-06-30 16:37:32,Fully vaccinated since April….this last Friday I sensed a cold coming on. Got tested last night and I’m positive.  This thing is still around and I fear there will be a small uptick in cases since the reopening and de-masking. I will start wearing masks again full time for a few more months.
2021-06-30 16:38:36,"Once again US politics is clouding sound reason and public health safety . LA County Public health is looking at the numbers while NYC is too worried about optics and the mayor's race.   
  As of June 28th only 47% of the US or 153,776,118 people have been fully vaccinated, of which  55% of the population has received only 1 dose.
  The DELTA variant is more resistant to vaccines and spreads more rapidly 60% more transmittable than the ALPHA variant as it  mutates successfully.
  The partially vaccinated  25 million people risk getting of infection is 66% meaning about 17 million people partially vaccinated are going to be infected. 
   Now comes the very serious point for the NON vaccinated (about 1/2 of our country) if and when they will get this highly contagious variant 148 million people will be infected with DELTA COVID or another even worse variant as it evolves because it is. 
   So now 17 million plus 148 million or roughly 165 million will be severely vulnerable to this more infectious variant. 
 
    Now to the protection of vaccinated. We are not or will ever be immortal because of the RNA vaccines small study vaccine lasting defense. Pfizer and Moderna offer us protection at 88%(or less) leaving at least the 12% or 18 million more of the US population who are going to get ill.  
So with rough estimates --basically 183 million people are at risk here.
 I am vaccinated and I  am still going to wear a mask indoors.

2021-06-30 16:44:19,"Just to add to the experience/approach in Saskatchewan, I think the comments this week of the newly installed Chief Medical Officer of the Province of Ontario are worth noting.

IN my Province we now have about 80% of the adult population with at least one COVID 19 vaccination shot., and close to 40% of the same population fully vaccinated with 2 shot.

The pressure to speed opening up and relaxation of health measures is overwhelming, but public health officials are finally being listened to by politicians  (having gone through a 3rd wave.

The Chief medical Office said ""On average ""delta"" wants to go from one person, to six, to thirty six to two hundred fifteen in a 1 to 5 day cycle. For all these reasons we need to be cautious, we need to be prudent and we need that 21 days [pause between phases of opening up] to understand the impact... We never want to take a step backward. We only want to be moving forward"".

That's like saying ""Yeah, I know we said it was mostly about protecting other people, but that's not what we really meant!"" Since I am now at much less risk (but not at zero risk) of getting or transmitting the virus, I should no longer be concerned with other people? So I guess I'm with the W.H.O. on this."

2021-06-30 17:06:58,"The CDC, presumably at the urging of the Biden administration for political and economic reasons, really botched this one. By telling vaccinated people they could go without masks at all times, but providing no means of telling the vaccinated from the unvaccinated, it was an invitation for all to discard masks. How could you not know that the first ones to discard would be the unvaccinated, who deny the virus anyway? I'm fully vaccinated but have never gone into a store, etc. where there are people I don't know. It's not a big deal except for people who want to put their ""freedom,"" actually ignorance, on display."
2021-06-30 17:08:27,"I just spent 3 days in Detroit at a conference interacting with literally hundreds of people without a mask or a vaccine. I didnt get Covid. Covid fearmongering is so tiresome. Cases have drastically fallen to the lowest levels since testing was widely available. The Delta variant is more transmissible but there is not a lot of concrete data proving that its more deadly. It has this scary sounding name and gets hyped up by the media, but in reality its just Covid. Im not afraid of Covid, and no one is going to scare me with media hype. As an MIT-educated biologist, I know data. And data shows that Delta is not some new scary thing but rather just another version of the same disease we have been dealing with for 18 months. Sure, its more transmissible. But viruses generally evolve to become more transmissible and less deadly. Covid will do the same. By the time we get to the Omega variant we will have a common cold. Stop being afraid. The media is the virus."

2021-06-30 17:36:36,Notwithstanding Senator Paul's  explanations data now available from India shows that the delta variant infected more younger people and the death rates were higher in younger people. In fact the death rates were higher in people who were younger than 55 than older people. The good news was that vaccines were still effective. So we can vaccinate and wear masks if not vaccinated.
2021-06-30 17:38:18,"I thought that when the CDC lifted the mask restriction that it was making a huge mistake. We should have left it in place until our vaccination rates were higher. There will be no going back for the people who were already anti-mask (many of whom are also anti-vax). So now even with Delta circulating we will have to accept that some will do nothing to help the rest of us. 
I, for one, have gone back to wearing a mask in public places (even though vaccinated). 
Btw, the other day I was in an indoor venue with coughing sneezing teenagers.  Were they vaccinated? Were they sick? Were they tested? Were they sick with covid? What am I supposed to do - interrogate them? Ludicrous. I will just wear my mask, thanks."

Its impossible to quantify, but there is certainly some humanity or even joy lost in interacting and I believe that has harmed us all. I think we need to ditch the masks the moment it is safe to do so."
2021-06-30 17:46:32,"“Officials at the C.D.C. disagree, saying the risk is minimal“
I found your article quite useful, but feel the word “disagree” is unhelpful in describing differing positions between WHO and CDC. The majority of vaccinated Americans received excellent vaccines supported by outstanding science and regulatory review. The WHO must make recommendations to a more heterogeneous world of sometimes more poorly characterized and/or regulated vaccines with variably worse performance. Thus, while their recommendations may differ, that does not mean that they disagree."
2021-06-30 17:51:31,"The “strategy” of dangling maskless faces in front of the unvaccinated didn’t work.  And no one who actually interacts with people who don’t want to get vaccinated thought that it would. 

All that happened is the unvaccinated, who were grudgingly at least wearing masks much of the time, just stopped wearing a mask.

Now we’re all living a surreal version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers where the unvaccinated and possibly infected look just like the vaccinated. 

Now even if the CDC tries to walk it back they will never again get the amount of grudging compliance they got before.

This was entirely predictable and preventable."
2021-06-30 17:53:13,"So, we are told to continue wearing masks and social distancing, and in some places, implementing restrictions or lockdowns…even though we were told that we should get the vaccine, that it’s safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death. So, if it is so effective, why the continued restrictions? And if it isn’t actually effective, then why I am getting a new (created in under a year), experimental, not fully FDA approved vaccine if nothing in my life changes, and I have to continue to social distance and mask? (Which is not healthy or normal for humans biologically wired to be social creatures). Businesses have been destroyed, poverty is worse, mental health issues are off the charts…..
And also, another thing I’ve thought about. Is it my duty as a vaccinated person to give up my life and freedoms to protect a person who chooses to not get a vaccine and may possibly get Covid and have a higher chance of dying? Perhaps there are some bleeding heart liberals who say, yes, it’s our job to protect the foolish. That’s nice of you, but there are a lot of people who disagree, including myself. 

There are risks in everything we do. I chose to take the risk of getting an unapproved vaccine even though there is a chance of developing health issues (blood clots or heart issues). I weighed it against the risks of getting Covid, and decided the risks seemed lower for the vaccine. I have friends/family who came to the opposite conclusion. People disagree. Get over it."

If we had been under anything resembling true and patriotic leadership, the brave and fearless people of the US would have blazed a path right through Covid-19 with judicious lockdowns and safety measures. And now, with ample supply of the vaccine, we’d already be on our way to a bright, healthy, and normal future.

But here we are in a potentially endless fight because so many misinformed people have decided that instead of being vaccinated, they’d rather run around seeing how many coronavirus variants they can add to the mix.

That means everybody, vaccinated or not, has to make decisions based on epidemiological facts. Like continuing to wear masks indoors in public spaces social distancing and  normal hand washing.

For the authors to ominously frame a piece around the delta variant using language like ""worrisome,"" ""nervous,"" concerned,"" ""fearsome,"" when -- by the authors' own acknowledgment -- the risk posed to vaccinated individuals is apparently only ""slightly less"" than what vaccinated individuals face with other variants is irresponsible and credibility-damaging reporting.  

Reminds me of the alarmism that we saw earlier this year in much of the Times' reporting on the South Africa variant -- where certain authors wrote about ""concerns"" that ""some experts"" had about that ""worrisome"" variant, forecasting a doomsday scenario that never materialized.  Maybe this kind of fear-inducing writing on variants will just have to keep happening in cycles.

Roughly half of the population of the US is in one of these three categories and remain vulnerable to Covid, the Delta variant in particular.

That you are in favor of *permanent* lifestyle change and masking in society.  Quit acting like “just a little longer” will satisfy you; you know and we all know that it won’t.  For reasons best understood by you, you are getting some kind of benefit from the pandemic in general and masks in particular, and seeing other people return to normal upsets you.  I’m genuinely, truly sorry you feel that way.  But if vaccines are not the end, then there is NOT an end.  I got vaccinated…and I am moving on.  You are welcome to mask(s) up (and face shield(s), and goggles, and gloves, and gowns) for the remainder of your life if you so choose; no one will stop you.  But enough already of bullying other people into catering to your fear and your anti-science, anti-vaxx religion of facial fabric.  I hope at some point you actually get excited and happy to see things getting better; normal life is great, and will be waiting for you if ever you decide to rejoin."
2021-06-30 10:43:00,"I read the other day that vaccines may actually fuel an increase the virulence and transmittability of mutated viruses, making it even more dangerous to those who are not vaccinated.  So the proposition that when you get vaccinated to protect those who aren't or can't be vaccinated is a very false proposition.  If you rationally stop and think this through isn't this how evolution works, that viruses not previously prevalent could be unleashed by stopping the spread of another type of virus.  This is why the scientists who say vaccines can stop COVID-19 spread maybe true, but they don't go on to say more virulent viruses may take hold, need to be questioned on these assertions.  They may actually be doing more harm than good by calling for vaccinations for all."
2021-06-30 15:43:28,"Given that one of the major risk factors for Covid is obesity, I'd sooner see an exercise mandate than the return of masks."
2021-06-30 10:37:14,"After the fear mongering of the first 85% of the article, the last 15% tells me what I need to know: as a vaccinated person, I’m unlikely to catch Delta, and if I do it will almost surely be asymptomatic. So the threat lies with the unvaccinated. 

Works for me. They should get vaccinated. I did, and I am done with this nonsense."
2021-06-30 11:39:03,"There is zero evidence of vaccinated people spreading the virus. How many people are getting reinfected? I think they must be immune deficit, and will not respond to the virus either, I thought it was very rare."
2021-06-30 14:22:48,"Frankly, other than those that have documented  medical reasons for not getting vaccinated, my patience has past. Tie any Federal or State financial and medical benefits to getting a vaccine and the reluctant lot will line up quick enough. The time for pussyfooting around this has long past. We have three vaccines, and some inventory that is going unused. When I grew up the Federal government had the right to draft us into the military, and to stick shots in our arms at induction. And, there is surely less personal freedom now then there was then. Line them up, inoculate them and this will be a problem of our past."
2021-06-30 14:28:54,Reality Check we can  believe or not believe .Fact is what enable covid is whats dangerous. Our so called represetives fail to warn people by telling them truth like person who contracts covid may never regain there sense of taste if person does may never be same. Sense smell is another . Question is why we still continue to do what enables covid like smoking or vaping . 21 chemicals in every smoke dont belong in them all of which can kill. Still our so called representives dont regulate industry to clean up tabbaco. So we continue kick can down road an hope some day covid disappear so we can keep on smoking an other vices of death.
2021-06-30 16:48:27,The only masks which are truly effective are N95s. They are medical grade and protect the wearer and those nearby. The rest of the masks are minimally effective. The virus particles are so tiny that they can easily evade the “protection” of cloth and surgical  masks. One might as well slap a piece  of Swiss cheese on one’s face.
2021-06-30 18:08:38,The Biden Harris Administration must reimpose total lockdown until everyone worldwide has been vaccinated. Only when all forms of disease are eradicated like the small pox can total lockdown be eased. Lockdown is easy. Stay at home. Stay alone. Impose maximum austerity measures and tax the wealthy who must pay fair shares to pay.
2021-06-30 21:33:24,Get vaccinated or accept the risk.  No more masks for the vaccinated.
2021-06-28 15:39:13,What they had gone through was very intense and very upsetting. There were tons of lives lost. I feel like we could have sent them a bit more oxygen that they could really use and what they need.

2021-06-28 16:01:51,The situation was so bad that at one point of time some of us considered outlandish solutions like setting up a home facility to perform electrolysis of water to generate oxygen in case the need arises. I am not even sure if this would have been a feasible or useful solution or if it was just plain stupidity arising out of utter desperation.
2021-06-28 16:23:48,"We ran low on O2 here in the US as well. We have enough O2 extraction capacity as needed on a daily basis, with maybe a few % extra to meet peak demands. 
This issue is a broader one than the oxygen shortage though and extends throughout the medical/healthcare delivery system. 
Our medical system is relies on acute care, timed to be used as-needed and any relatively high cost and/or fixed cost assets are scaled so that they are run at nearly full capacity. We don't have an extra 20% unused docs/hospitals sitting around. 
That translates into building only the hospital beds that can be kept at (say) 90%+ full so as to recoup the highest possible proportion of construction and equipment costs as early as possible. It's no different from any factory or airline where the physical assets are expensive so you try to push as many units through them as possible to pay back the investment. 
Getting back to the ""acute care"" approach. We do very little to prevent disease in America, despite protestations to the contrary. Our system relies on docs and nurses and hospitals who are there to take care of you when you get sick and then boot you back onto the street until next time. Sure, there are exceptions, e.g. cancer chemotherapy.  But by and large our already overworked docs (per insurance companies, can only give you your reimbursable X minutes face time or risk censure), in epidemics, have to bear all the cost of our having very little excess capacity."
2021-06-28 16:42:47,"Such a horrific response from the government - “The next week, a Delhi government committee formed to look into the deaths cited the “natural virulent course of the disease” and concluded that “shortage of oxygen as the cause of death could not be ascertained.”"

2021-06-28 17:30:59,"India is horrendously mismanaged and as a result thousands die needlessly every day.  When a country fails to have a government that has even the slightest concern for it's people and invests next to nothing in maintaining infrastructure, you end up with India.  As someone who's been there several times, I've always felt very sorry for the state of the country and the ABJECT POVERTY that, in spite of reports to the contrary, has improved only SLIGHTLY over the last decades as the country has SUPPOSDELY improved economically.

They actually inflated the oxygen requirement, a falsehood easily exposed by a recent court audit. The desire to blame Modi (and there's enough blame to go around, make no mistake) has risen to such desperate heights in media that it strains the journalistic credibility of the reporting. Using the excuse of a disastrous pandemic to drive for regime change in India should be outside the agenda of a responsible press."

2021-06-28 18:03:17,India is a place where you will find both socialism and capitalism equally inflicting damage. Inept handing of oxygen crisis by the government is one thing and daylight robbery by corporate hospitals is another thing. My suspicion is corporate hospitals did more to push population into poverty than virus itself.
2021-06-28 18:02:40,"India has lots of problems.  Huge disparities in wealth; affected by global climate change (warming) and drought, less food able to be grown by subsistence farmers,  and too many people being born..

And this is the reason why India under Modi will not change. The ruling government can get away with anything because their supporters refuse to see facts or listen to reason. 

I can personally vouch for the hunt for oxygen that ordinary people had to arrange for themselves. We managed to find a hospital bed for my very sick nephew but were categorically told we would have to supply our own oxygen. An agonizing hunt ensued and thankfully we were able to arrange it. 


Thank you for this article."
2021-06-28 16:53:55,"Many Indian deaths are unnecessary and caused by mismanagement and government too proud to ask for help.   India has large population over 1.2 billion people.  Mr. Modi's government could ask more help from neighboring China, which has already provided over 12,000 ventilators and medical supply.  But politics stopped him doing so.

Mr. Modi thinks India can handle this crisis with its own oxygen and vaccines productions with good transportation system.  He didn't have second plan when both oxygen and vaccines couldn't match the demands. Indian politics also plays an important part of this crisis management.  It is a tragedy in the making."
2021-06-28 17:26:18,"Most Indian hospitals do not have built in oxygen pipes. Many of them were built with about 10% of beds for supplemental oxygen supply. When the second wave hit, they had beds but not beds with readily available oxygen supplies. With a billion people, India needs to spend money on their healthcare infra structure. In addition, they could use their crisis management group that deals with hurricanes and floods for other emergencies too. It is too large a country for Mr. Modi alone to manage. He needs to decentralize his power. Even today donations that go through his fund are expedited and everyone else hits red tape."
2021-06-28 18:20:53,"Health is a state subject in India, as in States have the complete jurisdiction over creating and managing health facilities. In the 1st Wave, states resented all power being concentrated with the Central govt. Central Govt therefore took an advisory role, giving states enough grants and consulting to set up the necessary health facilities, which wasn't done. As per usual, NYT has a great culture of blaming everything on PM Modi."
2021-06-28 19:40:50,"Lived through it in Delhi and that's all I can say. Knowing for weeks that the healthcare system had simply collapsed. Got covid and recovered at home and that was like winning the lottery.

Incompetency from the PM, CM and pretty much the whole admin."

2021-06-28 18:32:12,"What happened in India was a perfect storm for a disaster. After conquering the first wave successfully the combination of over confidence, carelessness of both public and the government, holding election and allowing the festivals were the mitigating factors. The government was complacent and did not assess the need for the vaccines accurately. Such errors in a country like India can lead to deadly consequences and they did. Soon after the out break the greedy pharmaceutical companies and oxygen manufacturers failed the public and so did the private hospitals. Concurrently the government watched people dying and did not intervene. 

That’s why in democracy we need good government and a very strong opposition."
2021-06-28 19:21:26,"You can blame the politics all you want. The situation here in the US is the same. Thank stars that we are fortunate to have the best vaccines available and had the forethought to pour money into R&D. But >50% of the population in the US behave like they are illiterate experts. They ought to read such news and think what may lie ahead if they start behaving recklessly like Indians who despite what their Govt says or not, relinquished the masks and social distancing. I never rely on politicians. I go by what scientists say and I was strict with my 85 year old mother not to entertain anyone - even her brothers and sisters or friends. So far she seems to be doing well but social pressures are tremendous. Its a waiting game. Fingers crossed"
2021-06-28 18:28:26,"A couple of weeks ago, upon reading about how the southwestern state of Kerala was doing well in battling the delta-variant fueled second wave, I reached out to a good friend from the state’s capital city, Cochin. The state of Kerala boasts the highest education rate in India, even though it is governed by CPI, the communist party of India. My friend responded as follows:

“We here in Kerala feel safe and continue to enjoy the benefits of the proactive steps that continue to be taken by the State and leadership... Its as much to do with full cooperation and maximum adherence by the residents here. I also tend to think the commie nature of the ruling party where they go to extreme selfless levels of getting things done. And they do not waste energy to beat the drum but keep saying it's not yet over!

It's tough, but as a team they are doing a tremendous service. Patients are not being charged, and that's not surprising... there are lots of individuals and  groups here to also support Covid Orphans and Covid affected families who have lost their bread winner. These times have reassured hope and trust in humanity”.

My friend then attached a video clip of the state’s covid control center. Honestly, it resembled an impressive, large control room of say our National Weather Service. A wall of large monitors with graphics and data visualizations, facing rows of personnel helping to manage their response."

Want light in nights - get a inverter/battery and charge when municipality supplies power. Or buy a generator if wealthy. Seweg and waste water? Don't worry, let it flow on streets. It's up to the neighbors to worry. Recently I heard rich people in Delhi have industrial scale air purifier in their houses to escape from pollution outside. 

Now oxygen. I guess the next trend would be to install mini oxygen generator. Of course they are the privileged only. Rest are happy to live in HINDU India."

2021-06-28 20:10:31,"The nightmare was worse than what the article describes. In the beginning of April there were a number of opportunities to buy oxygen plants for Delhi hospitals as the emergency unfolded - Mr. Sisodia and the AAP refused to sanction the money - instead of spending it on flashy advertisement campaigns for their state government. Private individuals and companies bought them and gave them to the government hospitals bit by bit. Several years of adversarial relationships with private hospitals (they arrested doctors for getting covid-19 last year leading to protests, harassed doctors regularly) wrecked the crisis response system. In the middle of the pandemic, they spent more time trying to extort hospitals and institutions than solve the problem. When the Sikh Gurudwaras started getting credit for running effective oxygen cylinder filling stations the state government confiscated and shut down many of these facilities because it was making them look bad. While Modi certainly deserves a large amount of blame - the state government is certainly no less culpable in Delhi."
2021-06-28 20:38:42,"This is probably the first time the ""upper"" middle-class has been hit hard by Events standard of deviations away from the ""usual"" & their stories are no doubt heartrending. But these sort of ""encounters"" have been par for the course for the  poorer classes of people for whom even daily subsistence is a challenge & in the best of times. 

They are disenfranchised, cheated & robbed day after day & no one cares much about them. Why would people treat their own countrymen like that is not a very intriguing question at all. It is the value systems generally in vogue in the country. There are very good people who serve the poor with great self-sacrifice while at the same time are a nasty bunch who are unfortunately in the Majority who look primarily for their own benefit & for theirs, not stopping to think their actions might one day come & visit them at their own door steps. 

In this they are aided & comforted through following a religion which is primarily ""give & take"" transactional & doesn't care much for primary honesty.

Unless this changes & changes quickly India can give up the dream of beating China even if totalitarian is better than this re: taking care of basic needs. With India's great wealth of human capital in a vastly superior democratic system, such social ills cut the feet off that strength in a way China can only dream about. 

It is time for the powers that be in India to realize this & do the needful & quickly if they really cared about the country as a whole"
2021-06-28 20:50:08,"Important to do a detailed retrospective story like this, of course.  I do have a bone to pick with the headline and lead up. Reading the headline and the first many paragraphs, I was alarmed that it was news of today suggesting that hundreds of people died YESTERDAY, JUNE 27, 2021. I had to read fairly down the story to learn that it is a researched report about the timeline to learn that this is a backstory to what happened a number of weeks ago that we had read with horror in the news at that time. Please don’t do that. Sensationalizing, or dramatic story telling, might seem like good writing at your end, but it is just not right in a serious situation like this to cause needless alarm, though brief i of one read far enough.

Instead Of PSAs educating the billion and 300 million Indians about an effective prevention-education… Modi praised himself on the “success” of “defeating COVID 19.

 India is the home of highly educated people, who are among some of the most applauded doctors and surgeons even in the world. (I remember Dr. Subramanian, a pediatric surgeon, who performed pioneering heart surgeries in 1987, using the deep freeze technique to slow the heart to operate) 

The country produces the pharmaceuticals and instruments used for medical treatment throughout the world, yet ironically cannot secure adequate supplies at home. 

This is an administrative failure where those at the top are accountable, where seizing of power and consolidation of power pre-empts what is best for the society.

On a smaller scale this happens over here as well, of course, in some of the for profit hospitals with the worst reputations, who maneuver only those who have excellent insurance plans to ICU."

Clearly, some is justified and quite a bit is frivolous and is over the top.  If the richest country on the planet could not control the COVID disaster well, how do you expect the poor countries to do any better.  While we are constantly told that the 2nd wave was the result of some Hindu gathering, the simultaneous arrival of the Delta variant for the rapid spread is conveniently ignored or downplayed.   The Delta variant has now arrived in other countries and look at the troubles it is causing.  The low hanging fruit of blaming Modi without addressing systemic problems and 80 years of lack of planning with respect to healthcare is all the elites can offer.  Sure, their blue eyed Gandhi boy would have solved the problem with 0 deaths, free oxygen to all, even to every mosquito and cockroach."

There almost seem a willful negligence to heed any warnings that were given. In fact, what the second wave revealed was that only the privileged had recourse to any help. What was worse were on the ground stories in the streets of cylinders being forcefully taken away from poor people by the cops to be given away to others."

Improved understanding of the timing relative to contemporary social/cultural changes might allow us to better understand species barrier crossings. For example, if it was found that the epidemic coincided with domestication .... or with the development of hunting strategies that allowed human to target larger (read: new) game. Could shed light on what human-animal interactions have historically presented the greatest risks for cross-species transmission; which then might help guide research attempting to identify other epidemics by focusing on the timing of emergent cultural risk factors."

Covid is not through with us.  It will traverse the world many times over until it has used up all available hosts.  Then, who knows what will pop up.

That was due to a genetic separation of 10,000 + years or so, time that those on the Eurasian landmass spent mixing and adapting to those shared diseases.

Clearly COVID is not as bad as that (I am in no trying to deprecate the danger that it  IS) and it likely implies we, and not just East Asians,  have spent have evolved immune system strategies that generalize well enough from previous similar experiences.

""It’s a surprising finding (the degree of impact of a prior epidemic), since East Asians at the time were not living in dense communities but instead formed small bands of hunter-gatherers.""

And we know this how, exactly?  Isn't the above an example of how we're driven by the bias of modernity?  Our time is better than all former times?  The truth is we've no way to ascertain the truth of our bias.  We just presume. based on scant data, and go from there.

Now I'll allow that human beings at that time were in fewer numbers.  They were nowhere near our herd-like size.  But they could have been concentrated together in communities.  In fact I'd bet on it.  This is, after all, an attribute of the species isn't it?  We like to ""clump"" together.  It's what we primates do.

So, given this propensity the sort of epidemic signal being found shouldn't surprise.  A virus at that time would have swept thru the entirety of the clumped together population would it not?  And as the population dispersed and grew with time hence, too, the signal.

Just some thoughts worth about that much from an admitted layman.

As long as SARS-CoV-2 inhabits a large population of humans, new mutant variants will be created.  The variant that gets the tools to live in more humans and spread more easily will dominate.  The resolution of the Pandemic is at the level of the human population.

Because it has been determined that the genes which code for the Receptor Binding Site ( RBS ) of the Virus’s Spike Glycoprotein contain the seldom used CGG CGG codons to code for the amino acid Arginine. The Double CGG codon is oftentimes employed by gene splicing researchers in Gain Of Function Research as it is a useful marker as well. In the class of coronaviruses which include SARS COV 2 CGG CGG has never been found naturally.

Just when I started to think I should call my doctor, they stopped. This was in January/February and I didn’t even consider at the time that it was a side effect of the vaccination because it wasn’t listed as a side effect. I thought it was hormonal.

I had to lie down in the snow for a good five minutes just to feel normal and considered asking my husband to take me to the ER, but I didn’t want to be dramatic, so I attributed the heart pain to being out of shape.

Regardless on how minuscule the myocarditis cases (n = 484) overall this needs to be taken seriously. It's disheartening and infuriating to hear the CDC and medical doctors to say that its really very rare or extremely rare case or the risk and benefit ratio. They do not think what the person (and his/her family) will go through having this heart condition; the cost of treatment, the anxiety and doctors visits. I am worried for my young nieces and nephews health as well as others, if their parents decide to get them vaccinated. I am pro vaccine, if it's absolutely sure that there are no serious (long or short term) side effects.

This compares to the researcher estimation that the second dose for boys age 12 to 17 might cause a maximum of 70 myocarditis cases per million, which is 0.007%.  Maybe college athletes have higher than average rates of such heart abnormalities, but they would have to be ~330 (2.3/0.007) times more likely than others to have myocarditis-like symptoms in order to cause that level of difference."

The numerator of myocard. vax risk for  12-17's is stated to be 70 per million.  The denominator of Covid death for HEALTHY 12-17's is near 0 (zero) per million.

The British Medical Journal editorial board is speaking out against allowing emergency authorization of these vaccines in children, Germany and other European countries are not granting authorization for these vaccines in healthy children and teenagers. Meanwhile,  the United States (unlike the EU) is still not acknowledging natural immunity as sufficient protection from covid infection and continues to carry on vaccinating literally everyone, including children (and soon, infants), with total impunity.

2021-06-25 15:02:46,The virus was circulating in the fall of 2019 is what I believe. It was likely in Europe and around the world simmering in October 2019 or November 2019. I believe the coronavirus of January 2020 was likely a mutated version of an earlier version circulating in the fall of 2019. It likely leaked from the Wuhan lab and not a result of some natural cause. The guy I can't remember his name interviewed on 60 minutes who claims it did not come from a lab looked fishy to me. I didn't believe anything he said.

2021-06-25 15:30:50,What I am understanding from this article is that the deletion of the information is an attempt to hide the fact that COVID was circulating amongst humans for some time before it was identified in Wuhan. Since the only proven transmission from animals to humans occurred in Danish mink farms maybe we should be taking a closer look at Denmark! Stop believing. Start thinking …
2021-06-25 14:15:05,"Are we doing gain of function research here?  If so, what is the safety level of the lab that’s doing the research?

Isn’t Dr. Baric the scientist who helped train, and published papers with, the Chinese scientists in Wuhan?

Can the NYTimes please look into this?"
2021-06-25 16:27:31,"It does seem more reasonable that this may have been circulating around there in Wuhan long before it managed to infect humans through a zoonotic spillover process. 

Even if the laboratory had suffered from lax protocols, something for which there is currently only hearsay evidence, the scientists had protocols and would surely have tried to follow them, even if they made occasional mistakes. 

On the other hand, the open market has absolutely no protocols at all, mixes all sorts of animals together in a stressful, immune-compromised environment. 

Which would be more likely to breed disease? Surely, with so little to go on, I would still hedge my bets on the open market being the source. There was a recent article about the Russians messing around and releasing anthrax, but again, it only goes to show that it is very difficult for a lab leak to actually set off an uncontrollable pandemic. The open market gives the virus a chance really to test our vulnerabilities and find the places where we are not wary. 

Some ""luck"" is involved in the virus, but it is surely rare that a ""ready to go"" full-scale pandemic-generating virus would successfully emerge fully functional and take off from one careless misstep of some researcher. A test, and test again open market seems a far more prolific and successful brewing market."
2021-06-25 16:35:17,"I do not have a personal or political attachment to whatever the outcome is with respect to figuring out the origins of the virus. Saying that, I have found myself more recently interested in the topic, mostly from the perspective of--what can we learn going forward, rather than let's pile on the blame.

There are others who are following this much more closely and with a better background to interrogate the information and claims being made than I can. But one article I found quite informative about the lab leak theory that didn't strike me as having a heavy political agenda is by Katherine Eban in Vanity Fair this month, ""The Lab Leak Theory: Inside the Fight to Uncover Covid-19's Origins."" At a minimum, it is a fascinating read."

For example, in this case, the date and location of the sample collected would have been helpful. Often the person submitting the data is the lab researcher who is closest to the data, and not the head of a lab."
2021-06-25 16:59:49,"The data was submitted to the Sequence Read Archive of the US National Library of Medicine.  I would assume that data there is backed up on a regular basis, so even if it was then deleted by those who submitted it, is the data still in the backup files that would answer these questions?"

2021-06-25 17:56:56,"We will likely never find the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to a lab cover-up in China.  

However, the fact that scientists and researchers in China work on bat viruses not only in caves without adequate protection but also not always in high containment biosafety level 4 laboratories but at the bench unprotected doesn't bode well for a lab escape or being infected in the field."

Answers will help scientist so, this isn't about blame if any scientist in Wuhan made a mistake, it's time to tell the truth about the origins of this killer virus. 

Scientist shouldn't be working in the dark on this incase anyone knows more than they're telling the scientific community. 

Sharing scientific knowledge especially information on Covid that has killed and harmed so many people, is what scientist even in China should be doing to help the world's people. 

It's cruel if any scientist knows the origins of Covid and they are hiding it regardless of their reasons."
2021-06-25 19:08:59,"As pointed out in great detail by Zeynep Tufekci  in her article today, the main issue is not whether or not a lab leak is responsible for Covid. The main issue is that cavalier treatment of precautions in labs, both in Wuhan and elsewhere, and plain old hubris in ignoring funding restrictions, are rampant. And leaks from labs have occurred repeatedly.

That is what has to be learned and corrections made."
2021-06-25 21:48:05,"I’ll read this, I am reminded of a trip to the beach with my son who was then nine years old. The tide was way out on that particular day. And together we walked the flats on Nauset Beach, and discovered a huge Sandollar, easily four inches across, quite rare on Cape Cod. As I handed it to my son, I said be very careful, it’s very fragile. He took it in his hands, as if it was a frisbee, and then to his great astonishment, it fractured into 1000 piece as he flexed it just a little. In a certain sense, this is a metaphor for the kinds of mistakes that can easily be made, when we have yet to experience the true deadliness of something like the virus that visited us in 2019.￼￼"

Importantly, she writes well so she is a pleasure to read!"
2021-06-22 10:57:03,"There were too few people willing to speak on behalf of children during the pandemic. Emily Oster truly is a hero in my book. I follow her on Twitter and have seen the cruel and threatening comments left for her when she has come out with an unorthodox stance, and it has undoubtedly taken an immense amount of courage to continue to speak and publish on these issues. Those who told her to “stay in her lane” perhaps do not understand what an economist actually does. She helped us to take off our blinders and contextualize the risks and benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions for children from a data-driven perspective. Often times, this did not fit the narrow messaging from public health officials. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for all that you’ve done for children and families during this difficult year."
2021-06-22 11:01:44,"To state that Emily Oster's advice has made her a lodestar ""for a certain set of parents, generally college educated, liberal and affluent"" demeans that point of view. I am neither liberal nor affluent, but i am college educated and I find Emily's positions offensive, precisely becuase they are so non college educated. Where is the vetted evidence? Where is the logical strand for these arguments.  In our recent years there are a number of authors who have wrote about the death of expertise in America. Emily is another example of that, especially since she flaunts age old Aristotelian ideas about Ethos: why are we taking medical advice, social health advice, from a highly trained economist?  Find an expert in the field of thermodynamics and have them prescribe public health policy. Data, which is everywhere, does not, even most of the time, make clear cases for all kinds of policy. Who out there did not learn about ""lying with statistics?"" More important, isn't it obvious that in person learning is better than remote, with computer? I do teach, and if I want to make that argument, I will have to have data and also compelling reasearch in educational pedagogy. Apparently, not so Emily.  She wants to reassure everyone that they have personal choices they can make. True, including ignoring science, or ignoring that most science and medical advice is based on percentages. Nobody knew how deadly the pandemic could be. Those who guessed wrong are not celbrating their freedom."
2021-06-22 11:03:57,"Part of the responsibility that comes with earning an advanced degree like a Ph.D. (and I have one) is knowing where your expertise begins and ends.  Celebrity academics like Oster walk a fine line when they step into our social discourse, and it would be nice if some were more mindful of both their limits and their egos.  

I, like many other educated individuals, worry about the anti-intellectualism tainting our public discourse these days, and folks like Oster, in an ironic Dunning-Kruger twist, don't help.  

Yes, the fame and adoration that comes with being a champion contrarian can be difficult to eschew, but stay in your wheelhouse, Dr. Oster.  Managing a pandemic or an unruly child, for that matter, is more nuanced than your knack for numbers suggests."
2021-06-22 11:20:47,"It’s been so strange observing the COVID response or lack of response in the US from Europe. The vast majority of people here accepted restrictions and school closures when deemed necessary by authorities, but when we were told we could remove masks or send our kids back to school, we did so without much angst or hesitation. Elementary schools were open for in school lessons for most of the school year. As a teacher I can say that we took COVID seriously, but we also understood the vital importance of our profession. When it became clear that the risks were manageable, teachers bravely returned to the classroom, and parents sent their children."

When her methodology was criticized, she misrepresented the critiques as personal attacks. A shameful episode."
2021-06-22 10:30:37,Greenspan was an economist.  He was also friends with Ayn Rand. Some say he was responsible for the crisis of 2007-2008. He is not a god. This woman is not a goddess. We don't need to listen to them.
2021-06-22 11:06:17,"Since January 2020, my paranoid aunt in Florida and I talked multiple times a day about what she heard was happening in China.  We read articles about the novel virus and we discovered a 2015 article in Nature that discussed controversial gain-of-function studies and chimaeric studies that were being tested on horseshoe bats in China. In this 2015 article, the author reported that scientists deliberated over whether a lab-created virus from bats that attack human airway cells was worth the risk of a potential pandemic.  

We knew there was far more to the story than the government was letting on.   Moreover, my aunt believed that the threat to NYC was imminent seeing as a friend of her ex in Wuhan had been giving him a play-by-play of what was happening on the ground there.  Our all-knowing CDC, slow-to-the-punch media, and dismissive politicians like Nancy Pelosi, Donald Trump, Andrew Cuomo, and Bill DeBlasio downplayed the virus. In the months that followed, Fauci explained away theories that the disease was lab-created.  Media puppets rarely challenged these government talking points.
 
Rarely have the ""experts"" been the prophets that saved the people. More often, it has been a kooky voice in the wilderness with far fewer degrees but far more intuition.  I never needed the CDC to tell me my life was in danger.   People like my aunt and Emily Oster are not dangerous nor ignorant.  But people that appeal to authority in order to discredit them are both."
2021-06-22 11:05:21,"The phrase ""data driven"" makes me cringe because of the penchant of people to focus on certain data while ignoring others.  And she is out of her lane, grossly.  Parenting books from an economist?"
2021-06-22 11:06:36,"Ms. Oster exemplifies the cult of the amateur. In many ways this is the most dangerous side effect of the influencer myth. Instead of having heavily curated information by experts, we rely on the ramblings of the Wikipedia addicted, the has-been stars, or teenagers that have little to no life experience. 
The price has been enormous but it’s all good because they’re telling us what we want to hear. The established science sources seem boring and are often stifled by funding threats. So it’s not hard to find someone who also agrees that you should not wear a mask, have a little wine when pregnant or avoid gluten even if there is scientific data for any of those things. 
So if you’re bored, rich and not sure about the effort to truly master a discipline, this is a great career choice.  Skip the years of a science and math. Glide over the doctoral thesis committees. Your audience is already waiting somewhere on Instagram or Twitter. But hurry because they’re not known for patience and that hashtag keeps changing."

Meanwhile our district grandstanded equity and bumbled through a coherent reopening plan and put teachers in horrible position to implement new curriculum. Hundreds of families are leaving the district.

Grateful Ms. Oster is trying to offer a reasoned and researched perspective. Those are in short supply."
2021-06-22 11:01:22,"I am a parent of a school-aged child who read Oster's first book during my pregnancy. I also have a degree in public health. I valued her work for years, but became disgusted by her tone during the pandemic. Cautious parents like me were portrayed as emotional simpletons who didn't understand her data -- which, it's important to point out, always suffered from heavy selection bias. I appreciate that this article clearly identifies Oster's true audience: white, privileged parents driven to return to work regardless of who suffers. I regret trusting her earlier work."
2021-06-22 11:07:04,Talking about wearing masks.  Does wearing masks increase panic in people?  Is panic something we want to encourage?  A lot of the behavior during this pandemic has been driven by panic.
2021-06-22 10:44:19,"My 1 1/2 year old grandson went back to day care in March and within 2 weeks he and all 7 of his classmates got Covid, undoubtedly because they were too young to wear masks. Fortunately they all were only mildly sick.  But, he spread the virus to his father, who fortunately was vaccinated, so  had no symptoms.  Bottom line, albeit from an N= 1, masks in school are necessary to prevent spreading the disease to parents or other vulnerable people at home."
2021-06-22 10:53:08,"All Dr. Oster needed to do was look at the reams of data collected from Michigan schools to know it wasn't safe safe for in person classes in most areas. And yes, transmission did happen in schools and it still is happening. But getting ""our"" free babysitting back so kids are out of our hair is more important than the long-term health and well-being of the children. The CDC said kids couldn't get infected so  they didn't need to be tested. Then it was they can get infected but don't get sick so they don't need to be tested. It wasn't until Sept. that kids were tested in any significant numbers. 

And seriously, she isn't a scientist, apparently knows little about the SARS-COV-2 virus and can cherry pick data with the best of the best. When kids are required to be vaccinated against now rare diseases to enter the classroom so as to not spread the  diseases, why  allow unvaccinated kids in a classroom during a pandemic that is closing in on 2/3rds of a million dead just in the US?"
2021-06-22 10:45:20,"If Ms. Oster taught a full schedule at a crowded, dilapidated public school, where testing is not conducted, vaccinations are not required, and masking and distancing are personal choices, her opinions would carry more weight. 

Her employer, Brown University, spent much of last year online and currently has very strict Covid-19 regulations. At Brown, everyone, regardless of their vaccination status, will be masking indoors and unvaccinated people are required to mask and distance outside. They will continue those measures until there is a 90% vaccination rate among students and faculty. 

Public school teachers, students and their families would have no problem with in-person learning under those conditions. Perhaps it's easier to encourage others to accept risk when your own safety isn't at stake. I wish she'd use her position to encourage all employers to provide the same safety measures that her workplace does."
2021-06-22 11:45:54,"I worry about the ability to maintain adequate objectivity around science and data when the scientist/economist/academic takes such a strong position before or while conducting the research. Being a celebrity academic also adds to a real potential for bias, conscious and unconscious. Confirmation bias too. It’s one thing for a researcher to take a position on what their own research findings may mean for the real world. It is another for them to be evangelical about the issue they are studying. When someone tries to be both of these things, I tend to worry about the potential for bias in their own research and their interpretation of related research conducted by others. All of this school stuff will of course shake out with time as part of the scientific process. And it is great that Dr. Oster and others have and are conducting studies to provide even more data. But we always need to be careful about the decisions we make in the moment, when we can’t wait for all the scientific studies and all the scientific data that we may want. I think it is almost always dangerous to rely on a single expert’s viewpoint. In the absence of enough evidence, it is best to go with the consensus of several experts (and agencies)."

2021-06-22 10:42:45,"Kids should be back in school period. I have said this since September 2020. However, it is useful to see those who make this decisions and were listened to and those who fears are ignored. I am a black man, my extended and immediate family has lost 7 people to this horrific plague while many of my wealthy white friends have merely had to work from home. There wasn’t a universal pandemic. There was a health care calamity for poor people where wealthy upper class people got to stay home and working class people had to put their lives at risk everyday for ignominious pay. 
As a matter of fact seeing as many of the “essential” workers were people of colour. It looks a lot like another phenomenon in our history where wealthy white people could stay indoors and black, brown and poor white people had to go into the fields.
(Also, what is the NYT protocol for using “Dr” as a title?  I thought the New York Times restricted it to medical doctors only. )
The economist Dr. Oster  should have the humility of knowing that this arrogant analytics elides the reality of poor people and the judgement call around the virus when you have seen family members die in their numbers.  
America is condescending to black people. It is mean to brown people. But it’s cruel commitment to the destruction of the poor is terrifying. Little wonder Judith shklar calls cruelty the worst of the ordinary vices."

2021-06-22 11:51:36,"Her mistake is not realizing that a one size fits all approach doesn't work. Sure, a well-funded exurban school with low student-teacher rations and plenty of space, where most of the families at home are two 30-something parents in good health, could have probably opened safely early. An overcrowded under-funded school where more than half the kids live with elderly and/or high-risk family members, not so much - no matter what the data says. Doesn't take an economics PhD to see the difference."
2021-06-22 11:26:16,"The last line of the article says she is sure of her opinions, because she’s seen the data, a paraphrase, but close. Well I’ve seen the data as well, and opinions based on logic and data are only as good as the data available, which for most of the pandemic was paltry at best. As things normalize I think you’ll find that children haven’t suffered anywhere near as much as some have thought, and given the gravity of the situation, a bit of collective suffering was to be expected. Ask yourself, if you were a public school teacher last year and into early 2021 would you have wanted to be in constant contact with hordes of kids. They may not have gotten very ill, but you might have."
2021-06-22 11:32:44,"Americans, mostly in blue areas, have greatly exaggerated the risks of returning to school. I say this as a liberal and a parent whose child has been in school all year. We must look so strange to Europe, where kids returned to class with little fuss.

2021-06-22 11:14:25,"Her writing was deeply frustrating to some of us who work in public schools. The lack of humility — an awareness that, perhaps, some of us did have good points to make that she’s ignoring — combined with the fact that places that ought to know better pushed her view ahead of others (The Atlantic!) reiterated that many Americans don’t care about teachers as much as they claim."

Open up the schools fully and send the kids back."
2021-06-22 11:44:20,"Is her work peer reviewed? 

It’s not stated in the article one way or another. 

I work with data. What she is doing is not hard and you do not need to be an economist to do it. The challenge is the devil is in the details. Also, at the 1000 foot level and what is actually happening on the ground can be very different. This can play havoc with the results of your data analysis.

She got reopening schools right — yes, the dataset was flawed by design, but it reinforced the lack of catastrophe from the Southern public schools that reopened in early August.   We can’t spend six months for a peer-reviewed study that often asks the wrong question every time we need to make a decision as a society.  I think Emily’s best quality is that she searches for reality either in pockets of the US or worldwide, rather than assuming the worst will happen and dismissing all data that doesn’t confirm that scenario.  There are plenty of alarmist, absolutist, single-discipline scientists to listen to about COVID, Emily is a useful counterpoint to the conversation."

Why does she send her kids to a private school? I am sure that one of the reasons she does is because she doesn’t want her children treated like a stastistic."

Dr. Osten may be exceptionally skilled in reviewing data sets but to claim that she can interpret them like an infectious disease expert  is a stretch. Dr. Osten appears to be a parent guilt alleviator: they are sick of being cooped up with their second grader who is needy, has the attention span of a gnat and is much less entertaining when they can’t self soothe, which during the pandemic appears to be a 24/7 condition. Ya, I want someone to tell me to send that kid to school too. 

I guess everyone has an opinion on how to parent. Here’s my recap: parental consistency, give kids lots of age appropriate freedom to try new things and gain confidence, foster intellectual curiosity, teach human decency, stop being a crazy helicopter parent- basically prep a human to function in society with minimal future interventions."

I spoke to two former coworkers last year, and virtually know one was wearing a mask in the community. (The NYT featured the area twice because the hospitals were overrun with cases and deaths.)  My classes were packed to the gills—40 students per class—in a pretty small room. I couldn’t even walk down the aisles to assist students. The windows were sealed. Opening the door meant bees and wasps in the class. Add to that, four of my classes were seniors, and I guarantee you, they would not wear masks—especially those who were 18. How, pray tell, would I take reasonable precautions? The community was infested with the virus.

A number of considerations:
1. ""data,"" whatever their sources and types, can be relevant to... or not. Valid, or not.
2. data, when analyzed in the appropriate manner, by people who know what they are doing, unpressured by influential, agendaed individual and systemic stakeholders, result in derived INFORMATION. Not THE Truth!
3. Analyzed data, appropriately, are transmuted into UNDERSTANDING; partial to complete, accurate as well as not, and suitable for the documented internal and external relevant conditions.
4. The analyzed data may, or may not, be related to planning, carrying out and outcome assessment on necessary or unnecessary  actions.
5. Data, from large groups of people, are processed into a statistical likelihood for the whole group...not for a specific person. Whether John or Mary should or shouldn't  go to school, taught  on Zoom, is irrelevant to the data.

“You can’t speak on X topic because you don’t have X credential” is such a narrow, foolish way of thinking in general, but especially in a complex public health crisis with medical, socioeconomic, and political causes that demands complex solutions. 

We *need* the perspectives of economists like Oster and experts in all disciplines, as well as the stories and insights of regular folks, to guide our solutions. 

Oster’s real strength is her ability to see useful patterns in data that most people can’t see because culture and politics cloud their thinking.

I am an immigrant, white, middle class mom of two and I do not support her view. And I do understand data and research."
2021-06-22 12:08:56,"Ah, yes, the same ""data driven"" educational jargon we've been gobbling up for the last decade in standardized testing of kids. I've been an inner-city high school teacher for 26 years, meaning I'm fairly old.  Teachers wanted to be in the classroom, but we didn't want to get sick, and more importantly, we didn't want to get the people we love who are elderly or with low immunity sick--and perhaps kill them.  That was the only ""data"" I cared about before I was vaccinated.  Our students aren't numbers and neither are we."
2021-06-22 11:55:10,"At the center of Emily Oster's bias is self-centeredness.   She is a more sophisticated version of the far-right using data skewed through a lens that ignores the common good to justify positions.  As she notes, [I and my tribe] ""can't wait around forever"".  

While the media likes to portray the impact of the virus impact on poor communities as the catalyst to drive school and daycare re-openings, data suggests otherwise.  In DC schools, the people who pushed for in-person school were the wealthy white parents.  Latino parents were overwhelmingly for keeping their kids at home.  Despite the extra burden on their HHs, they arranged with neighbors/relatives for childcare.  It was their terrible experience with the virus that contextualized their preference.  

If and only if vaccination rates and mandatory vaccinations are in place for the fall should we take down all the barriers.  The Delta variant is 60% more virulent than the British variant which is 40% more virulent than the original dominant strain.  In addition, the most effective vaccines are only 80-88% effective against the Delta variant.  Too many opinions on public health are derived from rearview data rather than prospective data with conditions."
2021-06-22 12:20:04,"The most important single data point on this issue came out of Wuhan and was reported in The Lancet in January, 2020. An asymptomatic child was shredding virus. 

We had no way to test people. When we got tests, we tested only symptomatic people. We had to close schools. 

We might have opened schools earlier had we been willing to shut down more of the economy earlier. We were not. 

The data shows that lower income neighborhoods suffered disproportionately. Essential workers? Public transportation? A culture of extended families? Food banks? 

We don't know how it spread. That is the truth. We can trace a relatively small percentage of cases. 

We started to test some asymptomatic children late in the game. How do we know whether they are spreading it? We don't. 

In the absence of data, logic demands caution. Kudos to the caution that saved even one life."

Teachers should not be exposed to various forms of this virus because they work with the young. I'd love to see her work tirelessly for teacher pay hikes, better community schools, and jobs for the poor."

I rely heavily on my 72 yo Mom to help with my child. Without her, I have no idea what I would do. Millions of parents are in my situation. We can't afford to replace a grandparent or parent for that matter. If all around us we are told we are in a deadly pandemic, we are going to do whatever we can afford to do to protect ourselves. So grateful to have my Mom!"
2021-06-22 12:14:28,"“…nor did she have any deep personal or professional experience with public education. (Her two children attend private school, as did she.)”

And herein lies the problem with Emily Oster’s pronouncements: they bear no resemblance to the reality that is the public school classroom. Yes, in an ideal world, kids would have attended school in-person all year, but when so many of them attend schools with larger than ideal class sizes and substandard facilities, it becomes impossible to follow the basic safety guidelines needed to contain the spread of the virus. Private schools could open because they have small classes, well-maintained buildings, and adequate space for social distancing: many public schools do not have that luxury.

It would be great if Oster recognized this and used her influence to improve our schools, but instead she seems far more interested in using her problematic datasets to bash teachers and their unions. The fact that she receives funding from pro-charter organizations isn’t surprising in the least, and it should spark her supposedly liberal and educated supporters to think twice before accepting her word as the gospel truth."
2021-06-22 12:24:12,"It is the affluent parents who could carry out the virtual learning best and their children will not be falling behind when schools reopen this fall.
For low income parents there was a double whammy. Their kids did not have the basics  like good computers, high speed internet, to make virtual learning work. In addition, many of them also had to work in person and that meant that their children were unsupervised at home as day care centers had closed down.
As for the schools, where teachers were assured of a salary because of unions, they insisted on teaching virtually. Many parochial schools, with non-unionized staff, made sure students got in person learning by using creative ways like half the class alternating, etc.
I am sure we will see a lot of research on how this year has affected students of all types, public vs parochial, unionized vs non-union schools."
2021-06-22 11:53:06,"I taught this year, with 2 different levels of in-person. It felt fairly safe, I assume due to very strict masking. However, Oster and other data-collectors ignore the incentives schools had to undercount cases whenever possible.  In my school were all aware of cases that didn't make it to the public count; whether they made it to the state is unknown. I have yet to see an audit of the state data.  Also, if you aren't a teacher, you aren't aware that most of the year we were merely babysitting- kids would be right in front of me doing other things on their (evil) chromebooks, while I was stuck behind a camera unable to supervise properly. That's what was being fought for, babysitting, while those who most needed it, our students of color, largely stayed full remote. The anti-expertise and pro-data streak exemplified by Oster is ultimately harmful to society. It's already destroying teaching. Replace Wilde's ""cynic"" with ""education commentator"" as someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."""
2021-06-22 11:54:29,"It still is a mistake to open the schools entirely.  The behavior issues are still there.  Honestly do you think the kids are following the rules? Or that spaces are being cleaned? NYC schools are such that people leave the city and jobs to avoid them. The remote learning needs to remain an option. And teaching plans without the power grid need to be understood. Hello Encyclopedia Britannica. It needs teachers more than ever, just not contact. What's been made clear is that parents have no plan B and the schools should work on teaching networking to parents.  The next pandemic won't be in hundred years, if you haven't noticed the ""hundred year storms"" happen every other year now. And the masks can stay.  We should practice the courtesy.

2021-06-22 11:31:29,"The big problem with opening schools during a pandemic is this:

The more you expose children to the virus, the more opportunities you give the virus to mutate a strain that targets children.
We already know that children get it. And we already know that half of infections are from asymptomatic spread. Meanwhile, the studies that are being called ""the science"" by the media did no testing, and say they don't know the actual rate of infection in schools.

The only part of this article that uses the word test says, ""At least 30 students learning in-person at her predominantly low-income school tested positive for Covid-19, among more than 8,000 such student cases statewide""

The reason the response to Covid killed 600,000 Americans, and is now firmly embedded in the U.S. population is that we didn't take it seriously enough.

When you have a new virus, you can kill it off completely by starving it of new hosts. You lock down the borders as soon s you hear of it, then isolate and trace every case. Then it does not go on to be endemic to the population, making people sick until the end of time.
Instead, Conservatives decided to let it run rampant through the population, feeding it new hosts with super spreader events and premature reopenings that were followed by bigger waves than the previous one.

More Americans died than in any of our wars and countries that followed our lead are already creating strains that are more dangerous and affect children more readily.

We helped Covid"

That couldn’t be further from the truth - while Oster has opinions and recommendations, the reason my family loves her is because she provides data-backed tools and frameworks for making decisions both big and small. This ruffles the feathers of many experts who think the public isn’t responsible enough to make their own decisions off actual data (“if you let pregnant women have 1 glass of wine per week what’s the stop them having a bottle of vodka per day!”) and other gatekeepers of parenting rules. 

It’s not surprising that experts in a narrow field like epidemiology dislike Oster giving parents a data-backed framework for making decisions about how to live in a pandemic that doesn’t boil down to stay home until it’s all over. Helping individual families balance risk doesn’t square with their objective to minimize overall risks for the public, which means telling everyone to be as cautious as possible in a one-size-fits all way."

Why does being a professor at an elite university give someone like Dr. Oster the right to think she's the one with the truth? Her personal disconnect from the realities of public school ought to be enough for her voice to be ignored, but instead she uses her platform to be the expert, pushing her own agenda and clearly liking the attention."

2021-06-22 12:46:06,"I live in one of the school districts that did its best to stay open as much as possible during the pandemic.  But it was because we had the money to test test test.  That was definitely not true in other parts of Massachusetts.  Dr. Oster is the doctor of choice for upper and upper middle class parents who are insulated from the realities of this pandemic in other communities.  If the federal government had bothered to prepare for the pandemic and perform its duties, perhaps what happened would have fit Dr. Osler's predictions.  As it was, those predictions really only fit in the more well-off areas or parts of the country where public health and the common good held sway.

Can't wait to see if Dr. Oster changes her opinion if the Delta variant (which is much more infectious and infects children readily) takes hold.  If all the teachers, aides, parents, and eligible children are vaccinated it shouldn't be a serious problem, in theory.  But reality is often different than postulation."
2021-06-22 12:47:39,"Yes, students were at low risk. But many teachers were not. After the worst month of COVID in January, my school district returned to in-person learning in April, after teachers were vaccinated. (Students struggling with online learning could come back earlier, in February.) That struck the right balance."
2021-06-22 12:50:49,"Testing positive is quite a different animal than spreading the disease. Many fully vaccinated, asymptomatic individuals have randomly tested positive.  If all of those to whom the vaccine is is available actually get vaccinated, the risk for children to themselves, each other, and adults is negligible . High risk children will always present challenges.  However, the overall mental health risks of ""online learning"" far outweigh covid risks to children. Teachers and daycare workers are, and always will be,  essential workers. They could have likewise worn medical grade masks and safely been in Classrooms all this past school. A year of a child's life is too precious to squander."
2021-06-22 12:54:54,"Whilst I haven't read her writings about COVID, Dr Oster's philosophy in her parenting books is - here's the data, you make the decision. She is clear that this isn't about changing your mind to match what she thinks, but rather to provide you with the information to make your own informed decision.
It's well sourced, well-written and it doesn't judge.

Opening schools is a little harder - whilst my decision to have a glass of wine on my anniversary while I'm pregnant is about me and my unborn child, I can't individually make a decision to open schools that will affect only me and my family. And while there will be families for whom re-opening schools makes the most sense when presented with the data, there will be just as many for whom it makes more sense to continue learning from home.

I'm a teacher by profession and of course keeping schools closed has been detrimental to our students, however, I can't say that my reasons for wanting to return to the classroom as healthy, 32 year old secondary teacher can be justified by other teachers. And their feelings and opinions are JUST AS IMPORTANT as those of the families they serve. It's a difficult position and I don't envy those who had to make those calls.

All that being said, in the 21st century, we should be able to find innovative and interesting ways to deliver education via technology when needed. For many around the world, that will be their only access to education."

But we didn't. And the reason we didn't is because the media whipped up fear and anxiety on a daily basis.

Now, having ignored the science with all this hysteria we wonder why many parents are skeptical of when science says ""all clear.""

Throughout this whole epidemic children have by far been the safest group. Least number of cases, most successful recovery rates, least hospitalizations and by a huge margin fewest fatalities.

But once fear sets in it's hard to successfully appeal to reason. We have no one to blame but ourselves for being lemmings and our political leaders for being inept.

Sweden never closed its lower grade schools. What does their data tell us? Almost zero infections from child to child or child to teacher transmissions.

Now the same idiots who closed our schools are urging parents to vaccinate kids as young as five.

There are no, none, not one scientific study that attests to the safety of vaccines for kids.

The simple reason is the pharmaceutical companies never tested for this result and their own safety data won't be available until 2023.

Parents, stop worrying, send your kids back to school and tell the schools no masks and no vaccines until and unless they are both determined safe to a reasonable scientific basis."

Until I DO see that (and it shows that, in fact, whole populations of students remained unexposed) I am going to continue to believe that the cautious approach my community used was the right one."
2021-06-22 13:12:02,It is discouraging to see Dr. Oster’s work evaluating research addressing common questions related to pregnancy and childcare described as elitist. I’m curious why we do not see the same criticisms levied at male economists discussing issues “outside the home”.
2021-06-22 13:13:52,"This is about risk management.  How do we weigh greater social interaction and the benefits that come along with that - such as additional economic activity and in-person schooling - against the costs of such additional activity - such as increased levels of Covid-19 infections and deaths that necessarily come with such greater interaction?  People just have different judgments as to what an acceptable cost is for a certain level of benefit particularly when they may be personally affected by such decisions.  When people are not necessarily at as much risk personally, they are generally willing to allow for greater risk."
2021-06-22 12:59:48,"An economist is a medical expert?????   I guess I'll ask my medical doctor about my portfolio and current economical trends.  Everyone knows everything about everything...seems to be the message here. I just lived through a year of a statistician guiding the Governor of NC in setting COVID protocols.  WHAT A BLOODY MESS!!!!  After 55 years as an RN, this has been the most astounding experience since the NC ""team"" was like the blind leading the lame...totally missing the point over and over with no obvious understanding of human nature....had this NC statistician ever seen a human patient???"
2021-06-22 13:17:06,"In the case of educational settings involving groups of people, with a variety of individual and external physical conditions (ventilation, etc), any dataset on epidemiological conditions outside of that setting should be integrated into a more holistic decision making process. 

For instance, if some form of behavioral economic analysis had been applied, a zoom based focus group with people on the ground (teachers, parents, administrators, even the children themselves) would have revealed many of the defects of a given dataset and probably expanded it to other potential variables and issues while providing some hints at the reception to ""conclusions"" based on the data. This would have improved the decision making process, making it more individualized.

The central problem I observe is that Dr. Oster is playing towards people's confirmation biases (maybe unknowingly), without more agreement from the people who have to deal with the aftermath of making generalized decisions that require a more individualized approach."
2021-06-22 13:19:59,"Today's data must be viewed with caution when tomorrow's outcome could be the result of exponential growth of contagion. Virus present at very low levels—so low that cases escape detection—may hang around for many virus generations, before suddenly exploding in a virulent wave of infection. Trying to measure and quantify contagion during those intervals of low virus prevalence cannot deliver a reliable guarantee of a safe school year."
2021-06-22 12:21:42,"Dr Oster, PhD, offers important perspective. Her work is not cavalier, nor is it shoddy.  Opening schools wasn’t dangerous. Dr Oster was *proven correct* when vast swaths of the country opened them and there was essentially no school spread. There was a paralysis before reopenings and Dr Oster reminded people that there were costs to *not* offering school, on the other side of the scale from the costs of covid. I was very grateful for her voice. 

It is true that covid is scary and dangerous. It is reasonable to make choices for your own family that reflect your need for safety and flourishing. What I object to is people deciding their children won’t be safe in school and therefore *my* child won’t be safe. Even with week after week of zero cases in our pool testing there are petitions in my town to shut down the schools. What convinces people with an outsize scale of fear? Nothing, it seems. Perhaps they don’t need to be convinced. We can let them be upset while we safely resume some parts of life. 

I am disappointed with personal attacks in the comments because people don’t agree with Dr Oster’s data analysis—gut feeling and data analysis don’t bear the same scrutiny!  Those attacks are rooted in fear, sexism and anti-elitism, notions that weaken our democracy."
2021-06-22 12:22:26,"I find the the economists are voicing their opinions on too many issues. Nearly everything is related to economy these days, but one thing is certain: there is no data-driven approach available when there is no data. Unfortunately there is no national data available because the government gave up so early. There are some patched data available here and there (like the college case numbers reported on NYT) but that's pretty much it. For me (a full time statistician) ""Information voluntarily submitted by school administrators"" is equivalent to the ""survey"" you run on your twitter. 
NYT should be written more carefully not to distort the message as well. Science report linked in the article suggests ""We found that when seven or more mitigation measures were in place, the positive association between in-person schooling and COVID-19 outcomes disappeared."" That's not echoing her claims given that how things were handled in public schools."
2021-06-22 12:29:05,"Hello. Yes economist should have a voice in Covid , the same as farmers, lawyers, factory workers. The job you trained for doesn't preclude you from knowledge in other fields. 
I did my 12 yrs + 4 more in formal education. Some instructors were exceptional in their job, some were 
adequate, and some were putting in their day, for a days pay.
Yes, that is the facts.
So, yes I will comment to doctor, my barber, my homebuilder, anyone who 
making decisions about my life and well being. 
This is my life, I am not a tourist in my own life, I take it seriously, and express what I have come to believe is best for me.
Thanks you , to all who share researched information about life, disease, and government.
It will help me make decisions."
2021-06-22 13:01:32,"Cities chose educational inequality.  Cities deliberately chose to close public schools. 

Even after open parochial and private schools were open for months in the same cities, many cities still chose to advance disparities by keeping their public schools closed.  

Even after all schools in other cities were open, including public, parochial, and private schools,  these cities still kept their public schools closed.  

The damage done is stunning. The hubris and lack of respect for children is incredible."
2021-06-22 13:06:02,"As an economist, myself, I never offer advice on complex epidemiological issues. If I did so, I would not be ""out of my lane""... I would simply be off-roading without a helmet."
2021-06-22 13:12:28,"We live in tumultuous times. Demagogues blame Anthony Fauci as the messenger of unwelcome news. People don’t know what’s true or whom to believe. From climate change to vaccines, belief in scientists is faltering. 

Into this vacuum of civic trust in scientists and health experts rush all manner of opportunists. Those who do so peddling certitude are guaranteed lucrative book deals, fame and influence. In their rush to grab the spotlight, they contribute to the cancerous of science denialism. In so doing, they risk undermining the world’s battle against Covid-19."
2021-06-22 13:28:35,"""At least 30 students learning in-person at her predominantly low-income school tested positive for Covid-19, among more than 8,000 such student cases statewide""

An important question not asked or answered in this article is how many teachers acquired COVID from in person instruction."
2021-06-22 12:18:12,Health economics is an entire subfield of the economics discipline-- its not as if she's a macroeconomist analyzing these data. How else do folks suggest we analyze the costs v. benefits of reopening schools?
2021-06-22 12:54:58,"I'm really not sure what kind of evidence Oster was looking at in July of 2020.  At least here in North Carolina, COVID testing was not readily available; people with symptoms were turned away unless they thought they had come in contact with someone who was COVID positive.  Some school systems that reopened here tracked COVID cases among students and staff.  There were cases among both groups.  Whether or not schools were ""safe"" is a matter of judgement.  I don't know Oster's motivation, but she seems very concerned about parents getting back to work rather than the welfare of kids and school staff.  She's no hero."
2021-06-22 12:59:53,"One major problem is that we have extremely fractured, decentralized and under-funded data and reporting systems for most public services in our country i.e. education, public health and criminal justice to name a few. This creates a situation where academics have to take the lead in creating evidence to answer key questions. Oster decided to answer an extremely important question based on data that should have already existed at the federal level. We need to prioritize high quality, transparent data systems that can help us make decisions across all states, jurisdictions, districts, etc.. This, along with the wisdom of our public service providers who have boots on the ground,  local context and demographics gives us the most wholistic picture of what is happening so the most informed decision can be made."
2021-06-22 13:25:56,"Regardless of the current frenzy for all things data-driven, data itself is meaningless without interpretation, which is typically driven by preexisting motivations, opinions, or biases. 

The fact that all of Dr Oster’s advice fits the lifestyle of her tribe so well casts very long shadows of doubt over her interpretation. It’s as if she sought only data that supports her argument and ignored the rest."
2021-06-22 13:13:45,"Yes, some teachers and school personnel have gotten sick and some have died.  Teachers are essential workers. 

Nurses and doctors have gotten sick and some have died. We are essential workers.  I am so thankful to the teachers at my children’s open parochial school.  They kept my kids safe and learning inside school, while I worked in the ICU. 

It’s a worldwide pandemic.  Pragmatic choices, triage choices, need to be made. This is about managing risk, because eliminating risk is impossible."
2021-06-22 12:55:23,"While looking at the problem through the lens of economics, one can see giant holes in slavishly applying that model, or any data-driven model for that matter; simply read Freakonomics and you'll understand. Ms. Oster is a victim of her and her discipline's hubris, not over-reactive teachers and parents. 
It's important to look at issues from multiple perspectives and to turn to data to help us make decisions, it is equally important to question the data and to consider what the data DOES NOT measure. For example, as a high school teacher in a school with considerable student poverty, many of my students felt compelled to continue working throughout the pandemic. That is a dangerous variable that teachers of younger students did not encounter."
2021-06-22 13:03:54,Why do so many economists feel like they can opine about any subject they choose? They should stick to what they are trained in:  economics.
2021-06-22 13:31:57,"I’m in no place to evaluate her data-driven advice, but we took the advice of the CDC and local epidemiologist at our local medical school and we are all alive and healthy. What I wonder about is the spread and death rates in high risk groups in communities with open schools. We had opened schools, but our two school aged children (one of whom is high risk) learned remotely. Our state has one of the highest death rates in the country and at one time (I haven’t checked lately) would, were it a country, have had the highest death rate in the world. Did having open schools in our affluent area contribute to that? I don’t know. But I know our family did all we could based on expert medical advice not to be a contributor to that sad outcome."
2021-06-22 12:33:31,I'm generally skeptical of people operating outside their areas of expertise. I do think the closure of schools has had many negative consequences but I don't know if those outweigh the risk of disease. Remote learning only benefits those with the means to have computers and decent internet. So a generation of less affluent children are left behind yet again. And then there is the impact on women who end up having to do the bulk of childcare and education. Many have had to quit jobs because their husbands apparently don't pull their weight. So she might have a sliver of a point. But contrariness is often the hallmark of a crank.
2021-06-22 12:48:08,"It’s strange how all the restaurants, club sports, churches, schools, etc in Michigan bragged about how great their protocols were and how they had zero cases associated with their entity, but hospitals with the strictest distancing and PPE practices had large numbers of employees testing positive at the height of the pandemic; I mean not in large numbers where employees accounted for the 1,000 new cases a day in our county, but you know, 25-50 cases a day. It’s almost like the only place people got sick was working at the hospital and all of these other places where no one policed protocols were totally safe and not at all responsible for spreading the virus in the community. It’s a shocker that someone would cherry-pick that data from those entities that had no incentive to report cases and use it to tell people what they want to hear in spite of the science. It’s also rather shocking that the person who would cherry-pick that data would try to position themselves as a bit of a martyr."
2021-06-22 13:09:22,"she reminds me of all my cluless economics professors at an ivy league school who tried to drill into me with sincete conviction that free trade is optimal, people are automatons who always make cold, rational choices and that the free market always reached optimal solutions. my guess is that these very smart people were undeterred in their convictions by the rise of trumpism and the great recession. i am tired of private school parents ( i am one) lecturing public school parents about how great public schools are. i doubt the prof has set foot in a public school recently and, if she has, it is likely not in a poor, working class neighborhood."
2021-06-22 12:27:56,"As someone with advanced degrees,who has spent time in academia, I am familiar with people like this woman. They are arrogant, and think they can use their specialized training in one field to make pronouncements about others. Epidemiology is far different from Economics. It's not just number crunching. This woman did indeed put lives of teachers, custodians and others at risk by advising the state. She needs to learn humility."
2021-06-22 13:20:48,"Hmmm...well, here are some facts Dr. O. may want to consider: my urban high school students did not mind distance learning so much. Most did just fine. If they didn't do as much academic work, they DID learn many other things: how to work 25-30 or more hours a week and contribute to family income, helping to stay housed when a parent lost a job (something Brown grads like the good doctor don't have to worry about), how to teach younger siblings to use educational technology, how to cook, how to help keep their family home clean, how to cope during a pandemic. My students learned all that, and w know that in life, a lot of important learning DOES take place outside the classroom. They also overwhelmingly opted to stay in distance learning when we went back to school after many adults in MN were vaccinated, as most of my students are Black, brown or Asian. Many of them lost a family member, and I have one student , a very athletic, fit 16 year old who appears to be a long hauler, with likely permanent lung and heart damage. Those all might be things Dr.Oster puts in her data set too. People are individuals, and make their decisions as a family. Whether liberal or conservative, ""experts"" would do better to remember to respect large groups of citizens and not to assume they don't know what they're doing when they opt to keep kids at home during health crises, especially when the ""experts"" cannot wrap their heads around other lifestyles that are not affluent."
2021-06-22 12:34:29,"It’s ironic to me that Oster is criticized for being white and privileged when those facts made dealing with Covid personally less challenging. The private schools in Rhode Island reopened very early. Her own family could get through with relative ease. But her stats were not for people like her but for the huge percent of people whose children need to be in school so that they can become “privileged “. Pretty early on it was clear that few young children got the disease or passed it on. Especially those at the start of their schooling careers. I worry more that if science doesn’t effect the thinking of all of us, if trust in institutions is so low -what kind of society are we? Are we to only act on feelings? That leads to anti-vaxxers, vigilantes, conspiracy theories, etc. So for me, an underlying question in this article is how do we build that trust?  Destroying that trust allows the privileged to maintain their privilege so I believe there is a lot of cynical destruction of it."
2021-06-22 13:01:10,"Yikes, it's disheartening to see how many commenters are saying Ms. Oster's opinions are irrelevant because she is an economist rather than an epidemiologist.  I don't care if she's a high school dropout; we ought to be able to evaluate her opinions and recommendations for their merit, not her credentials.  Can a medical doctor have a useful opinion or insight about the economy?  I don't see why not."
2021-06-22 13:57:28,"Dr. Oyster is doing what economists do, collecting data and interpreting it. Most of the comments seem to have to do with how much trust people have in her interpretation of the data, based on the commenter’s pre-formed opinions. What I would really like to see studied and discussed sometime though, is whether the push to get kids back in school is based on what is best for the kids, or what is best for the adults?"
2021-06-22 12:40:24,"Anyone with ""clear and consistent opinions"" when it comes to complex situations like a pandemic is operating under the Dunning-Kruger effect.

The reason epidemiologists weren't giving ""clear and consistent"" (opinions early on is that the DATA WERE NOT IN YET, and the situation was volatile and evolving. 

I have learned not to trust PhDs and MDs who develop large followings on Twitter and engage in demagoguery. 

Dr. Oster needs to consider the damage she's doing to people's trust in institutions when she steps out of her lane to give facile, uneducated advice.  

(And can I just say, economists aren't even good at their OWN field of study -- the economy is not, and has not been, working for the American public for a very long time)"
2021-06-22 13:18:23,"Stop it with the both sides-ism- it's not what parents say or think, it's whether her ""science"" holds up- and it doesn't."
2021-06-22 13:42:56,"Maybe current data will change her mind.  As schools and sports have resumed the number of kids with COVID has soared. As more kids have become sick, we’ve learned about some of the deadly risks and post COVID syndromes that kids experience.  Perhaps now that there is a vaccinated population spread is slowing, but the idea that “kids don’t get COVID” is clearly a fallacy."
2021-06-22 12:34:13,Dr. Oster's advice is useful in context.  COVID's impact differs in many ways.  She is not the Dr. Spock with all the answers for all parents.
2021-06-22 13:45:05,"Oster appears to suffer from a syndrome that affects economists who explore areas far from their field. First, they read a little, and decide all the literature is worthless and should be ignored.  Second, they apply econometric methods in ways that are inappropriate to the little data they have, and publish articles that are not peer reviewed.  Third, rarely, they found journals that are only read by other economists and not subject matter specialists.

I've seen the pattern in both criminal justice and educational research.  Names on request."
2021-06-22 12:50:49,"Why do we think we need to re-invent the wheel, and that America is completely unique? Europe re-opened schools safely long before the vaccination campaign started, with no particular effect on infection rates. In fact, the only place where infections soared - the UK - is most similar to the US: Schools remained closed, but many essential workers had no paid sick leave and continued to fall ill and spread the virus."
2021-06-22 13:43:35,"This is a fascinating study in how our country is split today in a manner that crosses political lines. On one side, you have Oster who uses a completely data-driven, rational, cost-benefit approach.  We call this evidence-based reasoning or simply science.  On the other side, you have the narrative, subjective and intuitional form of thought that will often reject data or science.  Both kinds of knowledge-creation are needed but people who adopt each approach need to understand the limits, as Oster does.  In this case, public policy by rational analysis is better than emotion and subjectivity.  As I said, this is not a left/right issue. It is something deeper.
BTW, ""pullback"" is what we call changing your mind in the face of data or simply making a mistake.  It is a positive quality in people."
2021-06-22 13:50:04,"Perhaps Dana Goldstein should look at the data published in the February 21 issue of Science magazine of this year, or the Nature article published in November 2020. Both concluded that closing schools was among the most effective measures in preventing the spread of COVID."
2021-06-22 13:58:43,"I believe the CDC and the medical community need some young charismatic spokespeople. The problem is that personable people disconnected with the reality of life for ordinary people, disease profile/recovery/access to good healthcare, are now coming out and loudly voicing their dissonant thinking. I’ve given up on critical thinking in America. It seems like everyone simply wants to believe in something they badly want. And most love it if someone sounding authoritarian or pinning a pedigree of any kind to their lapel led them as the pied piper did to who knows what end. Why are universities not able to offer contrary voices to such loud, poorly thought arguments? Why can the CDC not spend time carefully refuting her hurriedly spat out analysis? How can an economist be so Rapunzel-like and so distanced from the narratives of the society around her?"
2021-06-22 14:05:59,"With the very intense tracking of COVID in our large school district, not once did they come out with the actual number of COVID cases that spread within schools. (Meaning, the only exposure a teacher or child had to a positive case was in the school building. I suspect it was minuscule). The vast majority of cases amongst children and school staff in our district were traced to: socializing outside of school, travel/club sports teams, personal travel, and other family members. Why is it so hard to get the actual data? I suspect because it would cast a poor light on teacher's unions who insisted that in person school meant certain death."
2021-06-22 14:08:44,"I'm a researcher, and I just finished reading Oster's pregnancy book, which I found extremely helpful. I am very surprised that she seems to be now doing exactly the same type of research she often criticized in her book. Doesn't she realize how biased voluntarily reported data is? That the parents whose children continue to go to school with a virus (out of choice or need) are different from those that (can) keep them home? How can she be making such definitive recommendations for a virus we knew nothing about three years ago? The caution and open-mindedness  (key for a good researcher)that I read in the book about some areas with no conclusive research seems to be completely lacking here. That's too bad, because I do appreciate her ability to summarize meaningful, relevant studies"
2021-06-22 14:11:01,"Oster’s conclusions are data driven. Just because she isn’t she isn’t an epidemiologist doesn’t mean she isn’t an expert on statistics- and no epidemiologist was an expert on COVID early either- it was an unknown disease. All we had was data. 

My husband and I work hospitality jobs and could not work from home. My 2 year old was in daycare the whole year, even while Montana sat at number 1 on the Covid transmission risk charts. His daycare was l hundreds of students, and in rural Montana, not a mask to be found, even from the providers. Infants through after school kids.

I made myself sick fretting every day. I figured our infection was inevitable. There were 3 cases of Covid the entire year in the building- no cases that spread between children, all cases infected by their household. No providers got sick. This was when my county had rates as high as 110/100,000. anecdotes are not data, but even I had to acknowledge that the overall risk to my son was greater during a bad flu season, and the odds of him bringing it home to us were in line with Dr Oster’s data- rare. If I had had the option to work from home, (as teachers unions pushed) I certainly would have, I was petrified. But I didn’t, and the results lined up with Dr Osters’ data, much to my surprise. The push to discredit her DATA because she is wealthy white woman and the results make people anxious is really confounding. If you want to push back against her, push back with data. I don’t see that here."
2021-06-22 14:11:41,"It often strikes me as odd as to why economists think they have expertise outside their discipline. Yes, data are data, but there is so much they don't know about the rest of the world."
2021-06-22 14:17:51,"Playing Russian roulette with a deadly virus by printing opinions that encourage families to take unnecessary risks is dangerous.  The new variants, which is the well known characteristic of viruses - that they morph into other versions of themselves -  seemingly affects children at younger and younger ages, and different than the prior version, is more dangerous to them.  Parents, not policy makers, are making decisions to keep their children safe.  If kept safe, those children are likely to live to 100 years old, more than enough time to make up for 1 year of delayed school attendance.  How does an economist not assign value to those factors?"
2021-06-22 14:31:51,"Like many complex issues, there are pros and cons that parents and teachers need to weigh.  In order to do that, they have to be armed with the appropriate current data.

My daughter teaches at a Montessori-based private school.  The school closed completely at the end of March 2020.  Under Texas law and mandates, they were able to open.  The administration decided to open for a limited summer camp in order to work out protocols.  They then opened with a slightly reduced enrollment for the fall--classes were divided into pods of 10 children.  After an orientation, parents were not allowed through the gates to campus.  Masks were mandatory for everybody and the rooms were wiped down mid-day and after the children had left.  The children had no issue with wearing a mask all day long.  If a child or a parent tested positive, the entire pod had to isolate for 10 days.   They made it through the year with very few problems.  

Likewise my grandson in Raleigh attended a charter school, they followed similar precautions, had to completely shut down for two weeks once when two teachers tested positive, but otherwise had few additional problems.  

What this says is that if sensible precautions are set up and protocols followed, a relatively normal classroom environment could have been had except that everyone would be in masks.  Hysteria in either direction does not help."
2021-06-22 14:35:17,"Dr. Oster may well have data to support her claims on various medical issues. Certainly she is free to publish them, and the points she makes should be considered and debated.

However, there are caveats. First, much of her data is gathered through voluntary surveys, which do not present reliable results. Scientific evidence is most reliable if is based on controlled studies or at least aggregate data collected from the full range subjects studied. 

It also should be self-evident that groups of scientists working together will tend to produce more reliable results than a single researcher FROM A DIFFERENT FIELD.

Finally, there is a strong possibility that her findings suffer from confirmation bias."
2021-06-22 14:35:20,"We sent our toddler twins back to daycare last Fall and it was a godsend for the whole family emotionally and mentally. Yes we were privileged in that both my husband and I were able to work from home, but it was enormously challenging trying to work from home while juggling childcare and toxic to our marriage and how we interacted with our children. We were confident the daycare was taking all reasonable precautions and in the entire time that the daycare was open, not one child or teacher has gotten Covid. We were certainly lucky but I can't regret this choice."
2021-06-22 13:49:29,"As always, beware the prophet that proclaims their message with certainty.  There are no certainties regarding covid, except that it will find ways to infect if given the chance."
2021-06-22 14:14:02,"I like Oster’s work on maternal morbidity and mortality, but I’ve been very troubled by her Covid-related advocacy and uninformed ableism over the last year. I’m certainly not the first to say this, but academic economists, particularly those who dabble in behavioral economics and social phenomena they don’t really understand, are notorious for exceeding their expertise and responding poorly to criticism. Like Oster, these academic economists do real damage with this pseudo-science disguised as data-driven analysis. Sure, it’s data, but garbage in, garbage out."
2021-06-22 13:39:32,"Those who follow others do so because they're hearing what they want to hear. That doesn't mean what they're hearing is factually based information. Funny how some people in this ""herd"" mentality are strongly against getting vaccinated, but will follow folks they know little to nothing about..."
2021-06-22 14:13:59,"Taiwan already had a model that worked. Squash and contain the virus, then open schools. All these self appointed “experts” never even considered the path that involved far less death. To be fair, our entire government never even considered stopping rampant death. But if you are going to look at data and spend your time advocating for a position, why not the one with a far lower body count. It should be an eternal shame how casually we treated the death of so many people."
2021-06-22 13:06:32,"Considering that the  USA   never implemented  universal  testing for the virus, so we don't know how many  children  have gotten infected - or  how many  parents and teachers  have gotten infected  from children - Dr. Oster's  claim  that  she  she looked at  the data  is  disingenuous;  The relevant data she claims to rely on is  virtually nonexistent."
2021-06-22 13:26:28,"I loved Oster’s pregnancy book and felt like it was the voice of reason and sanity in a culture where pregnant women are made to feel ashamed for wanting to be human beings instead of just incubators for other human beings. I think this whole “stay in your lane” thing has gotten out of hand and has become just another mean thing to say to people. It’s great if she wants to try to explain things with data. However, I don’t think you can apply data to this situation. If I were a teacher, stuffed into a classroom with a ton of students, I doubt I’d be thinking no worries, the spread is low, I’d be thinking any one of these kids could infect me and once I’m infected I could die or infect someone I love who could die. That’s not hysterical. It’s just the simple fact. So yes, perhaps statistically, you’re safe, but if you’re the teacher who gets infected, you stop being a statistic and start being a human being who is putting his or her life at risk for teaching. Teachers didn’t sign up for that. They are already demonized for trying to do their jobs in the midst of parental entitlement and parental negligence and everything in between. They are already raising people’s kids as well as teaching them. Let’s not add to the heap a new reason to castigate them for not wanting to lose their lives. It wasn’t a good situation for anyone. Kids being depressed because they are out of school is horrible, but I don’t think their rights supersede the teachers’ right to health/life"
2021-06-22 13:40:13,"My immediate reaction, ""Garbage in, garbage out.""  Our interpretations are only as good as the data on which they are based.  Because asymptomatic people, including the vast majority of children, were and are not tested for the virus, we can't possibly know how many children had the virus nor how many children transmitted the virus.  It is all conjecture and we must rely on what makes sense for all airborne pathogens: masks help, being outside helps."
2021-06-22 13:58:15,"If we look to economists for our public health advice, should we also get our taxes done by doctors and our root canals done by auto mechanics?"
2021-06-22 12:40:47,"Where was the discussion of out of school activities? Nowhere. Our public school district never openly addressed athletics and its risk to in-person school. It was very frustrating to hear “COVID doesn’t spread in sports or in the classroom “ yet we had positive cases every week. Pennsylvania did not contract trace schools, but partnered with districts. And of course the complete lack of testing, especially for asymptomatic spread failed to capture any data regarding classroom spread. Data was not available to monitor spread in districts statewide. Dr. Oster was repeatedly put forward as a champion for opening school without regard to other risky behavior and how to balance it ( such as asking athletes to remote learn during their sports season) . Parents were left with impossible choices and incomplete data, even with Dr. Oster’s analysis."
2021-06-22 13:53:03,So from now on we should ask epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists to develop economic policy for the country?
2021-06-22 14:13:23,Dr. Oster’s self-evaluation of being naive is an understatement.  Limited data sets combined with a limited understanding of the complexities of public education and the interests of the stakeholders makes her nothing more than a populist abusing her Ph.D.  A true “doctor” would have developed a multivariate approach to studying this issue before jumping to conclusions.
2021-06-22 13:32:46,"Science Matters.

Private Schools followed said science, remained in person and had no problems with ""super spreader"" events all the handwringing science denying crowd predicted. 

Meanwhile Public Schools caved and went virtual leaving their students to suffer and fall behind.

The reason is pretty simple: 

Private Schools don't have unionized teachers while Public Schools have a massively powerful union that extorts the taxpayer at every turn.

Even absent COVID we see FAR better results from Private Schools even though they pay less generously (especially on the pension) than our failing Public Schools.

If we want to retain a Public Education System we must abolish Teacher's Unions (and all other Public Employee Unions for that matter) because we cannot have both a Quality Public Educational System and Teacher's Unions at the same time.

It's one or the other.

Choose or watch School Voucher Programs spread and put the Public Schools out of business.

Your move liberals."
2021-06-22 13:40:46,"Oster has a theme, and it's good to have someone like her around asking the questions, even if ultimately we don't agree with her specific conclusions:

Is [the pregnancy or parenting concern du jour] in perspective?  Is the hoop jumping in proportion to the benefit? Is there a performative aspect?  Are we worrying so we feel like we're doing something, engaging in magical thinking, or more about putting moms through some kind of social test?

The debate about  kids to school or not started to sound remarkably like the vociferous arguments about the sip of wine or sushi---it starts with people who don't know epidemiology arguing statistics, ends up with lots of finger-pointing people calling each other selfish."
2021-06-22 13:42:47,"As we learned more about COVID-19 we learned that everyone was more vulnerable in public settings, including school. Just look at the outbreaks at schools and colleges that did go back in person in 2020. Don’t just look at the outbreaks just at the schools, but in the surrounding communities.  Many people still refuse to vaccinate but want their kids to return to school, citing personal preference. They are not considering all of the people who work with the public that don’t have a choice to isolate.  Teachers shouldn’t be forced to either work with people (children) who can’t/won’t vaccinate, or lose their jobs. I have a feeling Dr. Oster never faced this dilemma. Also, the whole myth that all children suffered by doing school at home is patently false."
2021-06-22 13:51:17,"I am a teacher at a school that was open most of last year and I am going to share a side effect that impacted children that no one makes mention of... going back to school in-person during a pandemic is traumatizing. 

I’ve taught for many years, and have never experienced such constant anxiety from so many children. Masks, plexiglass screens airplane arms and distance sticks separated child from child. They washed their hands until they were raw. Literally raw. Tiny cracked fingers that break your heart. Tiny children sat at individual desks inhaling one-sized-fits-all instruction because group and partner work (the cornerstone of good teaching and social development) were dangerous and forbidden. At recess, kids wandered around aimlessly, afraid to play with friends or touch something that has already been touched. Trust eroded as they navigated contradictory rules and social norms coming from society, parents, friends and teachers. “X slept over last night. Why can’t I play with X at school without a mask? Our dads let us at home. I hate school.” Kids were stressed. They withdrew. They had frequent accidents. They came to school late because they were having chronic nightmares. They shared the worst possible fears about bringing Covid home or accidentally killing a friend by giving them their germs. What a weight we unintentionally placed on such small shoulders."
2021-06-22 13:44:23,"The tone and tenor of many of these comments is shocking given that Dr Olster was right. Schools should have opened and much sooner than they did. In fact, one of the defining lessons of this pandemic is that they probably should never have shut down in the first place.  And that conclusion is driven by the actual science and data- not politics and fear. Just look at Europe where schools in some places were only briefly closed. Just look at some U.S. states (and private schools everywhere). How many teachers got sick with Covid from in school transmission?  Few to none- anywhere.  Between closing schools and wearing masks outdoors we over reacted in many ways and of course under reacted in others.  We need a commission to fully study this pandemic and our reaction so that hopefully the next time this happens we will proceed more sensibly."
2021-06-22 14:00:13,"Remote might have been about keeping teachers safe at first.  What it quickly devolved into was a strong-armed contract renegotiating tool utilized by opportunistic teachers unions.  Once the teachers had district leadership over a barrel, nothing was off the table.

Nothing demonstrated this fact better than a Zoom-based meeting by the Austin ISD leadership to gather public opinion.  It was supposed to be a chance for parents to express their opinions for or against remote learning.  What it actually featured was dozens of unionized teachers reading the same prepared statement over and over.  Clearly they didn't care what parents thought about anything.

My personal opinion is that public employee labor unions, be they firefighters, police, or teachers, are bad news.  Ultimately the workers serve only the union, not the public."
2021-06-22 14:03:13,"Economics as a social science which has been proved wrong so many times in our neoliberal era that no one should be listening to her baloney. What does she know about public health? Or public schools for that matter? Has she even set foot in a public school? I doubt she or her 'followers' have.
 Economists paid for by the elite class at Ivy League schools have lost all legitimacy. They pore over data sets determined to make the ""data"" say what they want it to say,  selling the  joys of free trade, the brilliance and truth of the unfettered markets, and that all humans are only cogs in a market economy. UGH. 
She is driven by one goal only: Get back to the status quo ASAP, get 'workers' back to work or else workers may organize and revolt against this 40 year onslaught against working and middle class Americans."
2021-06-22 14:03:56,"Fifteen months into the pandemic I’m still amazed at our American hysteria. I’m also certain we’ll look back at Dr. Oster as a visionary who risked her reputation and mental health to save children. It us stunning that we are debating whether schools should be open when indoor dining is available. Whether classrooms should be open when the mall is. Whether children are safe at school during COVID when our country makes dozens of collective decisions on a regular basis — from food safety to gun control to nutrition and exercise — that put children and adults at severe risk for injury or death, and makes them callously. Children need to be in school, full stop. That is priority one. Lazily wolfing down a double cheeseburger indoors between two pieces of plexiglass that do nothing to prevent an airborne virus should be priority zero — until all children are back at school. With precautions and vigilance it can be done safely."
2021-06-22 13:54:04,"She wrote this book.  She wrote that book.  People listen to her.  People turn to her.

I have a  two degrees, Electronics and Law. But that doesn't mean my opinion about any social issues should be given  xtra authority in areas outside my expertise.  Ms. Oster may be a well meaning person but as the old saying goes, ""To a hammer, everything a nail.""  

Now if she had a PhD in childhood education and development then perhaps we should consider her opinion."
2021-06-22 13:57:33,"Remember the old statistical maxim: numbers don't lie, people do?  Sounds like she's got a severe case of confirmation bias. She's an economist, not a scientist or a medical ""doctor."" I too have a doctorate - in business management; it does not entitle me to be a healthcare, pediatric or immunology expert.  Why anyone believes her hypotheses or acts on them is bizarre. Especially since she is someone with only private school experience."
2021-06-22 13:58:00,"Prescriptions for ""others"" are quite simple.

""Conclusions,"" some of which may be borne out after the fact, or at least after considerable time, are not trivial in risk or impact as 600,000 Americans have died around us and millions more have been severely sickened.

Debate and questioning the conventional wisdom (especially when events move so fast that the fact of ""conventional wisdom"" seems an oxymoron) are extremely valuable.

Hubris is not so valuable.  Especially when many may die, be severely sickened or be emotionally traumatized by weakly supported policy prescriptions.

""Moving the needle"" can be hard: as the decades of misdirection on ulcers showed.

Dr. Oster deserves credit for trying to enact change on important matters.  But some of her pronouncements (and much of what she says can only be called ""pronouncements"") are weakly founded, at least at the time they are made, and the implications they have can be deadly and dangerous.

So?  Some good.  And a lot (a whole lot) of danger.  

Anyone can cite ""data.""  The question always is the quality of the data and the relevance of quality data to the conclusions paraded about - not to cripple action, but to nurture reasoned action.

As a ""philosopher"" to guide research directions? maybe she's very useful.
As a guide for real world action?  often she seems very dangerous."
2021-06-22 13:34:31,"There's an old saying; ""the hammer thinks everything is a nail"". If we let epidemiologist dictate our response to Covid without any input from other voices then we'll wind up hiding behind masks and avoiding each other for years.
  So I'm glad for a different perspective.
  I can't help but notice that the families that got their kids into Catholic schools report zero problems either with illness or education. Much like what I've heard about European schools."
2021-06-22 14:39:59,"Dr. Oster's battle is an old one although the characters are somewhat different - you have two things in tension with each other, without perfect knowledge about either one, so which do you choose? In this case the things in tension are the risks of Covid vs. the risks of in-home education. The truth is, there is no clear right answer. But the good news here is that humans have been parenting for 200,000 years and we have managed to bumble through it so apparently whatever people decide to do it probably will be OK in the end."
2021-06-22 14:41:04,"I think it is a tendency of social scientists (speaking as one myself) to extrapolate their skills in quantitative analysis to areas outside their fields of expertise. This is not to say that they are always wrong, or that their methodological approach is wrong, but that they lack the expertise to nuance data/findings. 

Data is not objective truth, and its quality is heavily dependent on collection strategies, which are themselves rife with bias. In this instance, expertise in the infectious disease field or the childhood education field is crucial because that enables researchers and scientists to address any bias that they see (or can't see) based on their experience with a particular issue, rather than rely blindly on machine learning strategies that are no substitute for experience."
2021-06-22 12:19:12,"An economist by training … making public health claims … providing advice on child development … um, no thanks. Expertise in one area doesn’t make her an expert in other areas."
2021-06-22 12:49:42,"So while I can't speak specifically to Dr. Oster's words and actions, I have no problem saying: why would anyone take parenting advice from someone steeped in a field (economics) where the M.O. is to ignore evidence you don't like and to build rickety arguments based on specious assumptions.

An update to the old economist joke: ""assume a vaccine"""
2021-06-22 13:47:51,"While the article touches on this, Oster writes for a particular subset of people- that is, upper and middle class folks who are sending their kids to private, parochial or properly resourced public school classrooms. All of her analysis should come with a big, fat “IF/THEN” attached to it- IF you work in a school/send your child to a school that has not been chronically neglected for decades/isn’t underresourced/serving communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, THEN it is most likely safe with the proper precautions in place. Her analysis, when it came last July, was only further proof of a disconnect between so many espousing scholarly advice and the reality of Americans on the ground."

Life, however, is the antipodes of something abstract.  It is violent, brutish, and fricitive.  (A good analogy is the common law, which unlike statutory codes is formed by experience as opposed to logic.)  Human instincts are formed by life and not by charts and graphs; and it is instincts, not intellectual abstractions, that should appropriate dictate human behavior during these perilous and intellectually ungraspable times."
2021-06-22 13:13:38,The advice is not “counterintuitive”. That so-called “intuition” is paranoia driven by a parenting culture’s preference for caution reinforced by anxiety.

How many of the parents who were upset that teachers weren't willing to risk death to babysit their children actually volunteered to work in schools?  How many of them, backed up their ""School is the most important thing ever!"" rhetoric by actually contributing to the operations of a school?

I would love to see how some of these parents do in an actual classroom, if it's such an easy job currently staffed by lazy slackers."

She has used numbers to describe what has been happening and what we could most logically expect, and always with an open discussion of how the data she uses has come about—where was it collected, and what its limits and flaws were, and many many links to where she got it from. If you haven't read her columns regarding this pandemic, you haven't any idea what, or who, you are talking about."

2021-06-22 14:26:55,"I recall ""Dr."" Oster from her hit pregnancy advice books which similarly cast aside advice from multidisciplinary panels on life-and-death matters, so I am not surprised to hear that she has continued in the same vein. If she is so interested in writing medical guidelines, perhaps she should go to medical school. Then she would gain real, firsthand experience with fetal alcoholism, multiple inflammatory syndrome in children, and other devastating childhood maladies that she thinks are not worth the inconvenience of preventing. Perhaps in seeing and treating such patients, and trying fruitlessly to sooth their anguished parents, she would come to a new understanding of why medical guidelines are written by doctors and not economists."

2021-06-22 14:23:03,"Losing a child is one of the worst experiences a person can go through. So it's no surprise that many parents didn't want to risk in-person schooling, no matter how low the risk may have been. I also don't fault school systems for erring on the side of caution. If schools had reopened en masse and children began dying, the outrage (and trauma) would have been far greater than the outrage over schools staying closed. 

The reality is that Dr. Oster does not, in fact, have solid data on this. She has opinions, confidence, assumptions, books to sell, and -- as an academic whose kids go to private school -- very little skin in the game."
2021-06-22 14:38:46,"Not all working-class parents are people of color and not all college-educated parents are white.  It is important not to make these generalizations as if they are facts.  The statement quoted below would be just as true without inserting race into it and would not exclude people of color who are college educated or create the impression that all whites are college educated and people of color are working class - College-educated parents were more likely to want in-person schooling than working-class parents.  So the insertion of race has no basis here except to dramatize. 

""White and college-educated parents were more likely to want in-person schooling than working-class parents of color whose families were more likely to contract the virus or die from it, and who had more distrust of schools."""
2021-06-22 14:23:11,"Oster’s arguments for opening schools were always predicated on the assumption that it would help counter social and economic inequity. We know now that the laws of egregious inequity would be constant throughout the pandemic—that the kids who were most marginalized before the pandemic would be the kids who were even more marginalized during it, no matter what decisions we made. Data showed that Black, brown and poor kids would suffer the worst setbacks from missing school but it also also showed that these same kids and their families were going to be at added risk of death from the disease. This was something Oster seemed to have no sense or empathy for. Looking back on it, I don’t entirely think she was wrong to emphasize the value of opening schools, but only if we had a better, more equitable society to begin with. This overall lack of inequity wasn’t something Oster wanted to wrestle with. I don’t blame her, but it also made her injunctions to “get back” ring hollow to the lived experience of a lot of us."

2021-06-22 14:48:15,"Emily Oster is what happens when the wealthy elite sail far away from the concerns of most people. She's a daughter of Ivy professors, went to Harvard, is now an Ivy professor herself in a discipline that specializes in not paying attention to individual people. And she feels entitled to roll a tank over the lives of less-well-protected people because she's always been protected and always been told she's good and right.

I am a single mother with no backup. Had my daughter been forced back into school, she'd have gotten sick, and I'd have gotten sick, just like so many other people around here forced into contact with in-school students, K-12 and university. If I'd died or wound up with long covid, Emily Oster would not have taken any responsibility for the care of my daughter. If my daughter had wound up seriously ill, acutely or longterm, I would have been her sole caregiver, and Emily Oster would not have felt responsible for smashing the delicate balance that maintains a single-parent household and life. 

Once upon a time I studied economics, and in the end I left because I noticed that (a) while economists were happy to talk airily about this or that course producing pain, they managed to insulate themselves neatly from that pain and leave it to others, whether those others could afford it or not; and (b) they had no language for talking deeply about people's lives."
2021-06-22 14:48:57,"What Dr. Oster and every one-size-fits-all recommendation for schooling during the pandemic missed is that each and every school and each and every school district is unique. Where there were resources and space, schools were opened safely. Where schools were overcrowded and underfunded, there was no chance of opening safely and students stayed remote. Within counties and states, each school district needed the freedom to make the safest choice possible based on their own particular set of circumstances. And while many children suffered due to distance learning, many others flourished.
Science is all about recognizing the limits of knowledge, the limits of data sets, and being honest and forthright about what we know and what we don't. I wish Dr. Oster, and others like her would embrace the words ""I don't know"" a bit more often."
2021-06-22 14:55:09,"In our district, schools that strictly observed masking and distancing had zero in-school spread. All cases -ALL! - were individuals who caught it out and about in the community - at sports practice, dance class, etc. Schools that did not enforce safety protocols had significant in-school spread. Many had to shut down and go virtual. 

No doubt there are some districts with dilapidated buildings, a predominance of older teachers, or in high risk communities. But not THAT many. And the data (not just my anecdata) overwhelmingly confirms that children are not significant vectors for this disease and that following safety protocols works, even for the disadvantaged. Meanwhile, we just told an entire generation of kids that their future and the education that supports it is at the absolute bottom of our list of priorities. Good job, America."
2021-06-22 14:55:45,"Making decisions anchored only in economics, absent considerations of human costs, has done plenty of damage in the work world. Trying to apply economic principles to home and family in a similar way is not progress at all. We need instead to inject more expertise on humanity everywhere - early childhood development, individual adult development, growing relational currency (e.g., empathy) so schools, work organizations, children and adults flourish. Emily said it best: “I had maybe somewhat of a naïve approach."" Yep. Try listening for a while."
2021-06-22 15:06:15,"It is not uncommon for a person desiring to emerge as an expert in an academic area to try to fulfill some of that need by becoming a real sage elsewhere.

Good for her!"
2021-06-22 15:18:15,"As a parent of school-aged kids in Providence, I’ll say that I spent much of the fall looking for coherent information about what was happening and found Emily Oster to be one of the only local sources. Whether I think she’s right matters less than that I respect her efforts, which she also acknowledged repeatedly were not perfect. The more publicly vocal members of the Providence Teachers Union spent the academic year railing against various enemies, of whom Oster was a favorite, while seeming not to notice or care that parents all over the city were faced with a wrenching decision. The union’s contribution was almost entirely limited to complaining bitterly about their own perceived risks, which the numbers did not seem to support then or now. I feel for them and for all essential workers and am grateful for their hard work in an impossible year, but I lost an enormous amount of respect for the union members I encountered via their public statements this year."
2021-06-22 15:25:12,"While history may be lenient on some of the unnecessary actions during Covid, it will be brutal on what we allowed to happen in the school systems.  We can’t claim that we followed the science because the science did not know.  We made assumptions based on the worst possible possibilities.  When data on children started coming in over the summer, we stayed at flank speed on full lockdowns for the following year.  As more data arrived early in the school year snd some schools opened successfully, we found reasons why other schools could not replicate the success.  Throughout it all, we acted as if our actions had no negative consequences."

Their main asset is their naivete and lack of appreciation for data artifacts - this allows them to move fast. In most fields, the Osters of the world are grudgingly tolerated because they can't do too much harm. But epidemiology is different, particularly when there's an ongoing pandemic. There's no room for quacks. I'm disappointed that the NYT has given this shallow panderer so much air time."

American statistics education has been replaced by clickbait ""science"" with small sample sizes and poor reporting on correlation vs causation that abound even in quality publications such as the New York Times (read ""the health benefits of coffee"" published this month).

Greed killed many people unnecessarily in OUR USA, thanks to the orange man and his brethren who got control of OUR governments and did nothing.

The media, as usual, is concentrating on India and Brazil deaths and downplayed the worst country for the disease and deaths - OUR United States of America.

We don't need some wannabe ""economist"" deciding when OUR children should be sent back to the classroom.  The answer is when they - and their teachers, bus drivers and other school workers - are protected against getting and passing this deadly disease.

This is why you will often have two qualified scientists arguing vastly different things over the same set of data.
As is hinted at in the article, Oster's data interpretation seems to be heavily clouded by her upper middle-class, liberal-leaning academic worldview. People will say she is a hero or villain depending on their worldview. 
What might be useful for humanity is if people would get off of their lazy, collective behinds and do some actual research themselves on these issues, instead of constantly waiting to be spoonfed things they want to hear from people who share a similar outlook!"

She's quite willing to sacrifice some kids' lives/well being so that her numbers add up.

Depriving children of education and continued mask wearing, even among the fully vaccinated, has become the ultimate form of pious virtue signaling. No amount of data will change these religious-type beliefs that death is lurking around every corner. Sadly, the pandemic normalized serious mental illness, including OCD, hypochondriasis, and a variety of personality disorders. At the end of the day, most of us have already returned to normal life, and want our children to reclaim normalcy as well.

2021-06-22 14:52:09,"The comments here are mind boggling.  One need look no further than the comment section of the NYT to see the huge disparity in thinking that we, amazingly, still have on COVID, depending on where you live in the US.  That people on this board are still digging their heels in and suggesting extreme caution is STILL needed in schools?  What world are you living in?  

Further, I don't understand the criticism that this research was out of Dr. Oster's wheelhouse. Certain PhD areas require mastery of data-analytics.  The crunching of numbers, whether in economics or any other field, is substantially similar.  And despite what many commenters on here are suggesting, ""economics"" is not the study of money. It is literally defined as the study of limited resources and the trade offs we have to make. Not only is an economist not ill-placed to research COVID responses, they are perhaps extremely well placed (as part of a multi-disciplinary approach).  Her approach is far more usable for public policy that epidemiologist -- who, when polled by the NYT just a few months ago post-vaccinations, some 20% of whom said they were still taking precautions when bringing their mail inside the house!!! That is not someone who should be crafting public policy!"
2021-06-22 14:52:35,"Emily Oster is all about providing good, well researched information in gray areas where there is unclear information.  For parenting and pregnancy data, she helped me so much!  My doctors office just provided me with things not to do…with no real explanation of why.  Her book helped me make personalized, informed decisions.  I’ll always be grateful to her.  

With that said, good for her for speaking out and can’t we debate and analyze her ideas without shaming her and telling her to “stay in her lane?”  I 1000 percent reject that sentiment or that she is “too much”.  Debate her ideas and research rather than attacking her character.  Keep going Ms Oster!"
2021-06-22 15:08:25,"The basic bias problem of economists is to see the ""individual"" and their ""individual decision"" as the basis for economic choices.

But children are not operating as individuals. I don't doubt for a second -- I never did -- that children would be better off in in-person school. But if being in-person meant that they were more likely to kill off a parent (and literally millions of children have grandparents as primary caregivers in this country) -- are those children still ""better off""? If their teacher gets sick and dies, so they get a new teacher halfway through the year who doesn't know them very well -- not to mention the trauma of losing a teacher -- are those children still better off? 

Seeing children as individualistic consumers is pretty much the worst way to evaluate the best outcome for them. More than pretty much anyone else in society, their success depends on the social fabric around them. And that social fabric depends on maximizing the number of people who care for them who remain alive."

There is no need for Americans to fight about this stuff. People who want to be locked down, and/or want their children to be locked down and masked, can simply move to the states that favor shutdowns.

2021-06-22 14:52:45,"It is expected that different groups of people will have different opinions about how to open schools during a pandemic. It is clear that Democrats and teachers unions want to keep schools perpetually closed despite enormous scientific evidence that it was safe to open schools since summer of 2020. Republicans states opened schools with no adverse outcome. While everyone is entitled to decide what is safe, parents should have the ability to decide what is best for their families. Even in liberal CA private schools stayed open and I as a parent do not want public school bullies to dictate how I educate my child. I want to have real school choice and if public school is unable to educated my child the state should give me a voucher so that I can take my child to private school. We need real school choice and not have Democrats and public school bullies hoard all taxpayer dollars.

Any armchair expert can sit in front of her television or computer and shout her ""expertise,"" but few are given the national platforms to shape mass opinions.  It sounds like Dr. Oster was afforded the national platforms and received the consequent attention solely because of her class. 

Large urban school districts had extremely difficult choices to make during the pandemic.  Among them: teachers are working class, many with their own children with childcare needs, and their own health concerns.  The population of the school district in which I work is more than 70% below the poverty line.  When we returned to campus, less than 1% on my campus opted for in-person presence.  Their choices were dictated by fear of contracting the virus, spreading it in their home, to relatives, and in many cases their lack of medical insurance.

What Ms. Oster also forgets is that two thirds of Americans don't have college degrees so her argument really doesn't appeal to the majority of public school students or parents. And data doesn't give anyone all of the answers.
2021-06-22 14:46:38,"Dr. Oster's efforts are well-meaning and welcome. It did point out a couple of things worth noting.  The first is, when we look back at all of the things that did not go well with this pandemic, that there was a lack of centralized data.  Again, while Dr. Oster was well-intentioned, this lack of centralized data makes an environment ripe for misinformation. The second thing is that Dr. Oster should consider putting a group of (not-necessarily) experts to help with these thorny problems.  I believe if she was more aware of how different groups of people behaved, she would have clarified her recommendations so they would have more impact."

The key perspective of all of her books is to look at the data and have an informed decision making framework based on whats important to you and what risks you're willing to make. 

She wasn't ""right"" about the pandemic and schools, the data was right. The teachers union was wrong and fighting for their own power rather than for children's education (as usual)."
2021-06-22 15:03:40,"She was a vocal and confident proponent of opening summer camps last summer, despite very limited data to drive that decision. And she was dead wrong. Several summer camps had major outbreaks. We did not, at that time, have the knowledge and the availability of widespread testing to permit safely opening summer camps. (This summer, we do.) Why is this rarely pointed out? She cherry-picks the data to support her personal preferences, and rarely gets called out when she turns out to be wrong."

My spouse and I work from home but we'd have much preferred the kid being at school, mostly because the social isolation and hours screen time were taking a toll. The jumping back and forth between in-school and zoom-school also were also hard on our kid.

There were no outbreaks at the school, just a few isolated cases, mostly from kids who had traveled. We all heard the data about kids' infection rates. But the point was to protect teachers and staff, and to stop the spread. 

I'd never heard of Emily Oster but I wouldn't have used her work to beat our school's administrators over the head. They were doing their best in a complex situation."
2021-06-22 15:35:12,"There was always a disconnect between the idealized conditions she based her advice upon and the realities of teaching in schools. IF there were adequate social distancing and IF there were robust air circulation and IF there were adequate protective equipment  . . . From speaking with parents with kids in schools in and around Boston those ideal conditions rarely existed. 

Researchers need to understand and explain the limits of their expertise and advice in the way that practitioners normally do. In this case, it was too easy for many parents to believe that teachers were not at significant risk."

We should find out who is backing the views of an economist on school openings. And why.   Now she is publishing a book on child rearing out this August.  American culture has gone to the birds.  As soon as a person achieves any sort of public attention/notoriety, the person then markets themselves relentlessly--talk shows, books, podcasts.   She wrote some very stupid and very wrong things about Covid and stillmdefends them remorselessly.  If I did that as a physician, I would risk losing my license."
2021-06-22 14:06:12,"When the teachers were on strike in Kentucky, as I recollect - AND IN CHICAGO, too, a year or so earlier - the teachers emphasized that while they wanted to be treated more like the professionals they are, they ALSO wanted more money spent on education.

True, smaller class sizes result in more income to educators, but it's the furthest thing from self-aggrandizement.

Not so the likes of the UFT - it's just been 50 years of ""Gimme, gimme - MORE!"" ... and Ms. Oster has helped give the lie (hence, her being flamed!) to the canard that the only way kids could really benefit from school would come at the expense of great(er) risk to the ""adults in the room.""

Can't wait for Dr. Oster's book on the failings of ""big teachers"" re Covid. It's as if a group of soldiers said, ""We're afraid our hearing will be impaired if we go into combat.""

""Just say no"" has never been a decent (or moral) strategy - sadly, given the craven-ness of big city Democrats, it proved to be altogether effective when the chips were down for us as a country.

The ""dig"" about Dr. Oster sending her kids to private schools?!

THAT'S WHY! - If there's one place kids and their families should come first - it's in SCHOOLS!

Instead, the UFT and similar units did everything but - because they surely didn't have to! - lie down in front of school buses last September, turning a few months ""off"" from anything like learning into ONE AND ONE HALF YEARS!

We will pay a high price for that as a nation over the next 20 yrs."

2021-06-22 12:47:39,"Emily Oster is a highly educated person with an advanced degree who has strong opinions on a variety of topics and uses the scholarly tools she has acquired during her training for that advanced degree to argue in favor of them. But, she is not a medical doctor. She is an Economist. So, I find it odd to see her referred to as ""Dr. Oster. "" Wouldn't ""Prof. Oster"" be a bit less open to misinterpretation?"
2021-06-22 13:55:11,"Ms. Oster has every right to share her data and her opinions, as does everyone else, ""expert"" or not. What I don't understand is why she, or anyone, expects others to listen to her and take her advice.  We are inundated with advice from the experts. People pick and choose who and what to believe. Some go with Dr. Fauci, some Ms. Oster, some their mother, some Q-anon. With all the ""data"" and advice floating around no one seems to trust their instincts anymore. I don't quite understand the ego involved when Ms. Oster issues her opinion and then expects the entire US education system to follow her advice. Ms. Oster doesn't ""relish heated debate""? Then why does she start one? She ""feels bad about all of it, all of the time.”? Really? Then why have you inserted yourself in the middle of it? Go ahead and publish your books and give your talks and collect your data. But, don't be surprised if many people aren't interested. Why should they be? There's someone else doing the exact same thing at some other university. ""Experts"" are so tiresome."
2021-06-22 13:56:54,"Obviously Oster is highly qualified.  To be an economics professor at Brown is impressive. Yet, time and again when hubris draws famous people out of their lane, it can lead to severe harm. 

The last four years represent chapter and verse of ways in which powerful people end up in kitchens cooking up dangerous public policy. For example, the former guy employed a couple of highly qualified economists who were frequently at odds with the real world, using numbers as props to justify destruction, harm, even death.

One such “fakeonomist” was the Harvard trained Peter Navarro, who for some reason was anointed a key covid response leader. When asked why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, Navarro replied: “My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I’m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it’s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.

People who worked closely with Navarro agreed he was undoubtedly bright, holding a PhD in economics from Harvard. However, there was nothing in his career that suggested he had the credentials or experience to manage the former guy’s crisis response team to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country sorely needed in the early months of the pandemic. 

The tragic results speak for themselves. Now Navarro provides go-to rants on matters economic on Fox News."
2021-06-22 15:13:26,"What many of the comments reveal in their criticisms of Professor Oster is how miserably the CDC and the public health establishment mishandled the pandemic, leading so many to fear that children were going to kill their grandparents, and that we’re all going to die. 

Coupled with the story in the Times about the ineptness of the CDC, I don’t understand why we place so much trust in its recommendations (see, e.g., injecting newborns with aluminum)."
2021-06-22 15:15:35,"There’s a big difference between analyzing and accepting risks that affect only your immediate family (say, from having that sushi while pregnant) and those that affect your entire community (say, from forcing public schools to hold in person classes). 

Not to mention the difference between risks that you choose to take yourself, and those that you force others to take (same examples). 

Just because Oster is okay with the risks to other people and their families doesn’t mean they are, and shouldn’t mean they are forced to deal with them."
2021-06-22 15:19:23,"After reading Dr. Oster’s essay in the Atlantic, it seems like she collected most of her data by “Googling around” and “reading closely”. 

I can admire her for her role in challenging official health policies, which had their fair share of disordered thinking and “proof by authority”. Outdoor mask mandates, for example, or recommendations from the White House to cure yourself by drinking diluted bleach (which had the public support of senior medical officials in the former Administration). 

In the area of school reopening, however, she has fallen down badly. American school communities are highly varied. It isn’t possible to generalize about what would be best in all cases, except perhaps the need to combat the laziness and self-interest that we find in all human communities. 

Dr. Oster could have urged parents to demand evidence and logic from teachers and school officials. This would have done some good. 

Instead, she chose to enter the fray with generalizations of her own, based on what she could find online, and relying on her credentials to get a hearing. She’s had her fifteen minutes of fame. Let’s move on."
2021-06-22 15:20:07,"It would be extremely selfish of me to demand that teachers to back to school while I'm safely ensconced in my room. For parents that were able to work from home, Zoom school was not such a bad thing. In fact, I found that my kids learned more this year. We could check their progress, help them with difficult concepts, and notice when they were spacing out. Yes, they could not swim nor take sport classes. But I hope that they learned to seize the day and understand that the good life shouldn't be taken for granted, that opportunities are not always going to be there waiting for you. I also hope that the lockdown will turn them into better persons and that they understand better the potential of global warming to overturn our lives. 

Finally, when you don't have data, you can't make data driven decisions. Algorithms will spit out probabilities to ten significant digits but it's all garbage. Garbage in, garbage out."
2021-06-22 15:14:21,"The article should have actually dug into what she recommended, when, based on what data. But that'd be ""biased."" Much better to say, she says x, some say not-x, heck, we're not in the business of determining the truth of things! That might affect our market share, after all. 

Coming soon: Some say the world is round; others disagree. Controversy!

Anyway, back to the point here...

Generally speaking, public health, especially in re: pandemics, is interdisciplinary and multi-factorial and not usually amenable to Simple Pronouncements.

Meanwhile, the quickest way to fame and fortune is to tell a rich segment of society what they want to hear, and in oracular tones. I'm sure she's smart enough to know that. Plenty of real-world data support it.

I find myself often thinking of Gore Vidal's quip on the occasion of Capote's death: ""It's a good career move."" There's been a lot of that during this pandemic. Why not extend her ""counterintuitive"" brand to match the *intuitions* (ie, desires) of her target audience?

The key distinction to be made is that expertise, itself -- that is, reliable knowledge -- is indeed real. This or that ""expert"" may well not be worthy of the title, whether they're in or out of some ""lane,"" as the current annoying trope goes. 

But I'm being quaint. We don't bother following epistemological rules anymore; viz. the Alzheimer's drug fiasco. Just create and weaponize a constituency through ""anecdata"" and other forms of PR, and you're halfway to the bank."
2021-06-22 15:14:26,"Of course, her data set was limited at the beginning of the pandemic! She was one of the only voices early on warning of the danger that these closures could drag on indefinitely, when policymakers were blind to what they had set in motion and were declining to announce any metrics for school reopening. The closures were just a galling public policy failure, and reflect terribly on both the left and right in numerous ways -- it signifies our political rot both that the school districts couldn't successfully negotiate with the teachers unions and that Washington couldn't muster the billions of necessary extra dollars to aid local districts until the pandemic was basically over. If European public schools and American private schools could run in person for long stretches when most of our largest school districts were closed, I just really despair of both sides' commitment to the well-being of children. A society that really cared about its kids, about educating future citizens, about making sure that low-income kids in particular weren't relegated to a simulacrum of school, would have quickly figured out outdoor classrooms, would have sledge-hammer-opened school windows, would have repurposed closed convention centers and rec centers, and would have marshalled volunteer and para resources to reopen schools quickly after the initial March closures."
2021-06-22 15:25:42,"Thankfully, schools are not run by economists."
2021-06-22 15:14:20,"I have serious doubts about the soundness of most school data regarding incidences of Covid during in-person classes. The lack of testing for asymptomatic and mild cases—the very kinds of cases most children are likely to have—is an obvious problem. Even if you ignore that, there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence for parental secrecy about infection (at least around here). Some schools, too, reported only cases reported to them by the DHS, not suspected cases or cases reported only by word of mouth.  It adds up to a very incomplete picture. 

I agree that the evidence we have makes it look like at-home schooling was a criminal waste of time. However, there’s another data set that I think is even more suggestive. Here in Wisconsin, cases among most age groups rose at a slow and steady rate...right until a week into last September, when they began to shoot up. The one age group that bucked the trend? 18-24 year olds, who began getting sick two weeks earlier. The clear connection is the start of the school year in both cases. 

At best, we can only say that the right building with the right precautions can protect the right subset of people. At worst, we can’t even say that. Either way, it’s a slender thread to hang a life or death decision from."
2021-06-22 15:21:01,"Experts in one area often like to imagine they are wise in all things. Emily Oster seems a good example. She has a track record of publicity-friendly contrarianism that leads to lots of media attention and, incidentally, dead children (Drinking while pregnant is actually good! Children can't get COVID!).

""Data-driven"" is a hollow term if the data in question is flawed or incomplete, and it is hollower still when the interpreter of that data doesn't really know what they are doing. I hope to hear as little as possible from Dr Oster in the future, since her role in public debate seems to be justifying people's wishful thinking and foregone conclusions."
2021-06-22 15:21:27,"As an infectious disease doctor and epidemiologist, Dr. Oster's advice has been spot on in the middle of a lot of confusing and unscientific policy. 
I believe in education. I believe in schools. Private schools were open and the privileged mostly chose to have their kids not miss a year. My kids were in school. I was in person seeing patients. My family and I were largely safe with reasonable precautions.
The blind tribalism that is exemplified by comments below dismays me."
2021-06-22 15:24:05,"I think epidemiologists try to understand causation and then advise accordingly.  When the pandemic first started, they had no idea so drew on past related experiences, some of which proved not to apply, as you would expect.  They couldn't know how dangerous and transmissible the disease would prove to be, so made overly cautious recommendations, which was the correct thing to do.  Remember when we were all wiping groceries?  But after a month or two of wiping groceries, you look around and think, if the disease were really being passed on surfaces this way, all of us would be sick already (at least, I did).

Similarly, what Emily Oster is doing, and what economists are generally trained to do (I think), is look at conditions and then outcomes.  And what she saw is that when you send little kids to school with some basic precautions (wear masks, wash your hands, keep your distance), not a lot of people get sick.  And yes, there are a lot of ""whatabouts"".  Schools have to make a lot of changes.  Your town is different than anywhere else.  All the precautions will not be followed perfectly.  And some kids will get sick (mostly outside of school, it seems) and some teachers.  But have you heard about repeated super-spreader events at open primary schools?  Anywhere in the world?  It appears to be a (very) manageable risk.  It seems like some people want perfect knowledge and no risk, which none of us have, but a lot of people feel this is acceptable, given the role of schools."
2021-06-22 13:36:37,I thought Emily Oster was a charlatan when she first come out with parenting advice. Still do. Glad people are catching on. What she espouses harms children. Good parenting is the art of connection not number crunching.
2021-06-22 13:44:26,Anybody remember the economy class in Rodney Dangerfield's Back to School movie?  Economists are generally perceived as theoretical quacks by most everyone outside their field.  Certainly Oster appears to be as well judging by the venomous  reader comments.
2021-06-22 14:23:33,"What can economists predict? Apparently, Dr. Oster was more comfortable predicting the progress of an infectious disease. Who needs experts anyway? The real issue is, why would people listen effectively to a non-expert loudmouth. Why would the The NYTimes listen? But data were collected! 600,000 have died in the US and many will have life-long health issues from Covid19. What other data need to be collected?
The arrogance of non-experts."
2021-06-22 15:36:59,"Academic economist from an Ivy League School tells parents what to do with, and where to send, their children, in the middle of a pandemic.

Because she looked at ""data"", and this ""data"" told her that your kid won't get infected with COVID-19.

And if your kid does get COVID-19, and infects you and your family, and one of you ends up in the ICU, on a ventilator, that's totally fine, because it was well within the statistical margin of error. And she never said that your kid won't get COVID-19. The ""data"" said that.

Arrogant, irresponsible and immoral."
2021-06-22 15:32:41,"-- It seems a bit questionable (to say the least) to be taking medical & lifestyle advice from a number cruncher... (Don't be e suckered in by the 'Dr.' prefix).
     -But hey, to each their own.."
2021-06-22 15:36:20,"Oster’s “data” is a bunch of impressive-looking science-y charts and graphs that people who claim to be fact-based can use to shut up anyone who disagrees with them, but if you bother to actually study them you soon find out that it’s all cherry-picked numbers tailored to suit her argument, full of irrelevant and incomplete comparisons that occasionally even contradict one another.

But that shouldn’t be surprising considering her field. Economics has an undeserved reputation for scientific rigor and mathematical eloquence. Massaging data to fit their theses is what they do for a living. While that may have some value in analyzing market trends it has zero value in determining how much risk your child is in by going to school."
2021-06-22 15:39:14,"Although I haven't read the information presented by this particular economist, she may be onto something, even if she has taken things too far.  

Shutdowns in some areas became a form of virtue signaling, which they never should be.  Close hiking trails in Colorado?  Really?  Where is the data to support that stance, vs the obvious damage to mental and physical health that such a move would encourage? 

During the pandemic, far too many people were running around with their hair on fire, yelling ""do something!"" without thought to consequences of these actions, both good and bad."
2021-06-22 15:40:09,"Disclaimer:  I'm a doctor

Emily Oster is dangerous because she just looks at raw numbers without considering context.

She made waves a few years ago with her bold declaration that it was OK for pregnant mothers to drink alcohol because there was ""no good data"" to prove that it was harmful to babies.

But her definition of ""good data"" was absurd.  She insisted on a randomized double blinded trial.  Such a trial would be unethical and illegal.

Animal studies demonstrate conclusively that alcohol harms the brain of a fetus.  Emily Oster says that animal studies aren't good enough to ""shame women into not drinking"", which is nonsense.

Emily Oster wouldn't be so cavalier about FAS if she had any personal experience with it.  She obliquely brushes it off as an extremely rare occurrence.  But anybody who has an FAS child knows how devastating the condition is.  

This whole thing stems from the fact that Emily Oster didn't like being told by her OB/GYN during preganncy that she shouldn't drink.  She didn't agree with that, so she went on an adventure to ""prove"" that she was right.  She is the classic definition of a person who has a conclusion in search of evidence.

Just because we can't pinpoint the exact level of alcohol exposure that harms the fetus is an absurd reason to make the rash conclusion that ""light"" drinking during pregnancy is totally OK.

Any medical doctor would have known that."
2021-06-22 15:30:56,"There were things we could’ve done during the pandemic to actually make education measurably better. We didn’t do them. Oster was most invested in simply getting kids in school, not improving or even accounting for the kind of education they got. It was a stopgap measure at best and it skewed heavily toward the preferences of her own specific class of well educated fairly well off families. Oster was most invested in the pre-pandemic status quo—like if we could only get back to that then things would be ok."
2021-06-22 15:34:17,"Please stop saying that mask guidance in the pandemic was confusing- it wasn’t.  Early in the pandemic, scientist didn’t understand the virus and recommended we not wear masks so they’d be available for healthcare workers. As scientists learned more about the virus and how it spread, they rec’d we wear masks but leave N-95’s for healthcare workers.  None of this was confusing or contradictory, this is how science works- as we gain knowledge, we respond accordingly. Saying mask guidance was confusing is playing into a disingenuous narrative of the right."
2021-06-22 15:38:39,"I work in a public preschool and elementary school, in special Ed specifically. I fully understand the risks of working in person, as I did much of this year when my small but urban district reopened earlier than all others in the area, and stayed open during most of the LA surge this winter. There were times it was very scary. 

But people here are misrepresenting Oster’s work. She doesn’t do her own research, so it’s illogical to critique for selection bias, etc. She examines existing research, tells us (aka people who are not pros at reading statistics) where the research is weak, and says everyone should make their own choice. 

And even though I was scared, there were ZERO instances of student-to-student spread in my school. Students who were positive got it outside school. Obviously when case rates are insanely high, schools should close, as Oster has long averred. But it is ignoring evidence to insist that schools that are able to make adequate safety accommodations stay closed with reasonable community transmission."
2021-06-22 15:49:18,"This at least is a step up from lay people doing random research on google to challenge the opinions of seasoned experts in a particular field, but it highlights another reality that lay internet “researchers” don’t understand. Data is important, but its interpretation within a particular discipline or field is also important. There is the occasional benefit of having someone from outside of the field critique what might become dogmatic views, but for the most part, outside critics lack an experience with the subject matter to understand what data means in context. Epidemiologists, for example, do more than crunch numbers. They must also be aware of how information travels through the system to impact policies and the public’s reaction to the message. I’m all for challenging systems and developing educated opinions about a variety of topics, but it’s also important to know what you don’t know and to have some humility when challenging a specialized field of study."
2021-06-22 16:04:02,"One thing that many critics miss about economists wading into the pandemic debate: they are all trained statisticians, good at interpreting data, understanding what data says and what it does not. Further, they understand trade-offs.
I found that the public health professionals consistently misread the data, were late to come around new developments, and they kept looking only at a few issues.
So don't dismiss the economists."
2021-06-22 16:11:55,"One of the deep ironies I relish about economists is that their entire discipline rests on the foundation of ""the rational man,"" and their entire methodology is focused upon ""the data.""

And yet, as Dr. Oster demonstrates, they've discarded eons of data indicating that human beings are not reducible to ""rational"" actors, and thus the models constructed by the economists to predict behavior tend to be flawed and overly simplistic. (And their outcomes are often unable to be replicated, but that's another story.)"
2021-06-22 16:25:25,"She would have increased her credibility if she collaborated with pandemic related experts. I don't agree with what Dr. Oster did during the pandemic. Putting the data all together within current and past context is difficult and takes time. She also has to understand that her ""make your own decision"" mentality doesn't really qualify here. And once you gather a bunch of people together to collaborate over the responsibility of saving lives, things change. Not group-think l, but plurality-think."
2021-06-22 16:30:30,"Most people are not skeptical enough when considering ""data-driven"" opinions. It is quite simple to find data to support any opinion--the trick is to ignore the contrary data. Most people are also overly impressed by degrees which do not guarantee accuracy or honesty. Advertisers learned generations ago that dressing an actor in a lab coat sells more product. Trial lawyers also learned generations ago that parties can always find expert witnesses willing to say under oath just about anything you want. 

As for Dr. Oster, I haven't read her books and have nothing to say about her opinions."
2021-06-22 16:38:04,"I recall when the local start of school here in Maryland began in September 2020, the public schools chose to go the remote route but most of the private schools chose to do in-person learning.  I don't understand how the private schools could make it work but the public schools, with presumably a huge advantage in resources, in personnel, experts and financial, couldn't figure out how to replicate the private school's success?  I personally think it was the teacher's unions driving the bus on this one, not the school system nor the State of MD.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to plainly see that in-person education could work if given a chance with proper resources as the private schools proved it could.  Unfortunately for my son, he lost about a half-year of quality education he'll never get back."
2021-06-22 16:43:56,"Early in the pandemic, my very smart sister, who builds schools, said the way to reopen was to let high school students learn at home and move elementary students into more spacious high school buildings when in-person learning seemed safe. If only she had a substack audience."
2021-06-22 16:57:10,I don't want to dismiss her qualifications in her field.  But I am struggling to understand why everyone is supposed to follow one person's opinions just because they can collect and sort data.
2021-06-22 16:58:01,Why are people turning to someone who isn't trained in public health or medicine to make public health decisions? Choices about things like choosing whether or not to open schools should be made by public health experts not by people in unrelated fields.
2021-06-22 17:03:05,"The problem with the data she is referring to is that there is no robust, consistent data-set because there was not widespread rigorous testing for Covid in US open schools. Had we been looking for it, I suspect we would have found a lot more of it."

According to her current CV from Brown University, her last listed research publication on disease outbreak and children vaccination was, ""Does disease cause vaccination? Disease outbreaks and vaccination response"" back in 2018.  [Source: <a href=""https://www.brown.edu/academics/population-studies/people/person/emily-oster"" target=""_blank"">https://www.brown.edu/academics/population-studies/people/person/emily-oster</a> ]  Her conclusion in part: ""The key policy issue motivating this paper is how to increase childhood vaccination rates. The paper shows that disease outbreaks may be a powerful motivator and, in particular, that outbreaks may be a useful motivation even if they are not actually informative.""

So now what, can she conclude based on her ""vast quantity of research data"" to support the opening of schools with or without children vaccination (while hedging her bet by agreeing with imposing regional restrictions depending on positive cases?)"
2021-06-22 16:11:24,"Emily Oster stepped into the fray as a pundit, routinely veering way ""out of her lane"" as she puts it, to make pronouncements that we're used to bash unions , bully teachers, and railroad low income communities into back to school plans that resulted in chaos for the many communities that could not meet the infrastructure requirements for a safe return. I saw people in my community die of Covid and I thought to myself, what on earth gives someone such a profound sense of entitlement to venture so far out of her area of expertise in order to call upon others to take risks that she did not fully understand? Why did she keep going with this push long after people began to call attention to the problems with her data and her inattention to inequality? She was given a platform by people who should have known better. And numerous editorials in the nytimes, as well as other outlets, eagerly seized upon the narrative to attach teachers unions. We should not demonize Emily Oster for her role here, but reflect on these questions in order to remember that overreaching does not help anyone, and certainly does not help restore faith in science or in the media."
2021-06-22 16:30:54,"As an economist myself, I have to say Emily Oster is exhibiting classic economist behavior:

1. Do some complex statistics on noisy data.
2. Find a conclusion that benefits the wealthy upper classes. Bonus points if this conclusion is cleverly contrarian and proven with ""elegant"" math.
3. Ignore the opinions of people who actually have first-hand experience with the real-world settings where those data were collected. Mock these people for being less educated and ""naively relying on anecdotes""
4. Martyr yourself in the media to build your personal brand, sell books, and make large amounts of money.

Plus my kids are long out of school so it is difficult for me to suggest how someone else should deal with their personal situation.

Always, *always* know who funds published research. I have a background in qualitative data research. Just as data can be arranged with bad methodology into just about any configuration to support ones argument, so too does following the money show where the real intent of these publications lie.

A private educated Brown University economist with two children also in private school systems and no experience of either epidemiology OR education administration publishes research and opinions based on what? Her feelings that school should be reopened because it's been a hard year for parents and here's a data set to show why we don't care what school districts or epidemiologists have to say?

It's been a hard year for everyone. What's astounded me is how so many people - especially white upper-middle class parents - seem unable to handle a year of even some hardship. A hardship which I may remind, their less affluent fellow citizens are also going through with far less complaining. Instead, these parents flock to people who confirm their biases because they feel their views matter more than others and they prop up this Brown U. economist who gives parenting advice because she also happens to publish a contrary data set to argue for for reopening schools while still very much in the middle of a pandemic. 

Bravo, Dr. Oster."
2021-06-22 16:24:56,"Using  just “data and logic” is why economist are so often wrong when making predictions about the future. Numbers, by themselves, can be interpreted to tell you what you want to hear. What you measure and don’t measure, what assumptions you make, and how the data relates to current knowledge are all things to be considered. I prefer to take my public health and educational advice from experts."
2021-06-22 16:26:05,"I greatly appreciated all of Dr. Oster's books on pregnancy and parenting, highly recommend them to my friends, and have already pre-ordered her next book. She takes data, explains where the data came from, discusses all aspects of it (negative as well as positive), and invites you to make your own conclusions. 
As the article notes, there's a lot of ""advice"" being given by various establishments that is simply infeasible. If you have to get care for your child because you're a front-line worker and don't have the luxury of sitting at home, then yes, you need the information on which of two evils is better. 
Similarly, the various proscriptions on pregnant women are simply oppressing but impossible to fully comprehend unless you, yourself, have even been pregnant. So yes, an occasional glass of wine, some coffee, vigorous exercise, sushi, whatever else has become lore of pregnancy--it's OK for women today to have the freedom to make their own choices on those issues. Dr. Oster does not give a blank check to act recklessly; quite the opposite, she gives you information. What you do with it is up to you."
2021-06-22 16:46:22,"The criticism and vitriol hurled at Emily Oster is, almost without fail, based on who she is:  a white, affluent, Ivy League professor without a medical degree.  It is almost never based on what she has actually said.  That's for a good reason.  Her actual observations and recommendations are deliberate, thoughtfully caveated, and modest.  

As my wife and I have juggled two busy jobs with parenting a toddler during the pandemic, Dr. Oster has been a godsend simply for attempting to do what our leaders refuse -- acknowledge that real people need to make difficult, imperfect decisions and attempting to arm them with the information and tools necessary to make them as well as possible."
2021-06-22 16:46:51,"Anyone who argues that you must be a medical doctor to issue opinions like Emily is doing is grossly misinformed what skills are necessary to interpret data and draw conclusions from it. You need a background in statistics and data science, not in practicing medicine, to do what she is doing. As someone with a PhD in economics she understands how to analyze large data sets and avoid typical pitfalls that are present in data science (like self selection, over generalization, correlated omitted variables, etc). Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t believe in med school you have training in statistics and data science that is anywhere near as rigorous as that of a PhD in economics. In my opinion Emily oster is in fact more qualified than medical doctors to analyze data and multiple research studies and draw conclusions."
2021-06-22 16:18:47,"Data collecting during an overwhelmingly confusing pandemic mixed with anecdotal input. What could possibly go wrong?

I served on a rural school board in Vermont. Everyone who had ever attended school had an opinion about how to run our crowded 200 student school, starting with where the bus stops should be located, but certainly not ending there.

Reminding me of Dr. Oster, a Bryn Mawr educated townsperson, whose children attended the private Putney School, decided the town would benefit from her presence on the public school board. She seemed impervious to idea that the working class folks, including well-educated people, really didn't want her help. The five other sets of parents in town who also had children attending Putney School grew angry with the rest of us for opposing her candidacy.

These Trustafarians who had come to Vermont for the wholesome lifestyle weren't willing to fully participate when it came to their children's educations. Instead they opted at quite an expense to put their kids on a bus for over an hour a day, sending them over the mountain each morning. The woman withdrew from consideration. 

I've seen this picture before.  I am sure Dr. Oster would have had something to say about where to set up our bus stops. And we would have welcomed her input were her children members of our school. That's life in the USA."

Unfortunately it makes a poor foundation for informed policy. The expectation of flawless and immediately available solutions to complex problems drives all sorts of errors. The initial basic message delivered by public health experts in the midst of this unprecedented pandemic driven by respiratory contagion lead to conservative and for the most part correct recommendations in an effort to reduce illness and death-----reduce exposure to other people---distancing, masks, remote work, closure of businesses. We could have observed this basic recommendation while data was collected and interpreted in the scientific process to better understand risks and to inform policy. But not here---it seems that many were very comfortable with coercing and forcing others to bear the uncertain risks of exposure---ie teachers, delivery and warehouse workers, etc while they worked remotely or fled urban centers. The selfish perspective of affluent, insured and protected seeking confirmation bias on Substack too often drives harmful policy decisions. She could have informed and elevated the discussion but I suspect was much more interested in driving her brand. Welcome to the modern USA where its everyone for themselves."

Add to that the tone deaf hubris of speaking to an area outside her training, from a vantage point of Ivy League privilege with kids in private school, in the middle of one of the most challenging and sensitive times in modern US history.  Had she  written one op-ed stating her opinion and reasoning and then let the better informed, trained and experienced do THEIR jobs she might have deserved a  bit of respect. But her way- zilch.  She is really not much different than Trump, just with a veneer of ""science"" taken  outside of a hugely complex context.

2021-06-22 16:54:34,"One thing you absolutely need to understand about this virus is, like any virus,  it seeks hosts to allow it to reproduce and survive. When one segment of the population, the elderly for example, are no longer accessible, it will seek out another place to reside. It isn’t a conscious process, rather one of trial and error. A successful virus is one that doesn’t kill its host as that ends the virus’ quest. The best way to contain the virus and allow normal activities is to make sure enough immunity resides in the population from exposure or vaccination. Allowing a segment like school kids to go unprotected will result in eventual very contagious outbreaks and some, albeit small numbers, death. Assuming none of the variants the virus is allowed to achieve will result in a serious problem for children or others, even the currently immune, is a big roll of the dice."
2021-06-22 15:45:04,"As an educated ""coastal liberal,"" I have been dismayed to see friends and acquaintances enthusiastically espousing Oster's medical and childrearing advice -- and now her epidemiological prescriptions -- on faith. Oster has no training in obstetrics, pediatrics, public health, or children's development. Does she ever wake up in the middle of the night wondering if someone followed her advice and then lost a child as a result? This isn't a game. Slickly packaged books and Substack newsletters by an economist are not the appropriate venue for purveying information about central matters of personal, child, and family health. When I have a question about my son's well-being, I go to his pediatrician. If Oster truly is ""like, a tremendously sensitive person,"" she should pay attention to her critics and stop practicing medicine without a license."
2021-06-22 16:10:32,"The Times presents the controversy around Oster in excruciatingly oversimplified terms.  It presents Oster as a researcher who has been drawing conclusions from ""the data,"" and detractors as drawing conclusions from a range of other inputs.   

But many of the questions raised focused on whether Oster's data models were an accurate representation of real world dynamics,.  Many questioned whether the  K-12 data itself was reliable since infected children tend to be  asymptomatic and tracing in children wasn't as thorough as other demographics.  It's also dangerous to make proclamations without acknowledging basic disparities within the school system; they are not equally equipped to deliver the same level of care."
2021-06-22 16:49:00,"I await Emily Oster's inevitable comeuppance. I enjoyed the recent fuss about ""Tiger Mom,"" another person who felt compelled to publish a book with dubious parenting advice. I look forward to the children of these parents publishing their ""Mommy Dearest""-type best seller. I estimate about a decade to go before we learn how things really were at home."
2021-06-22 16:19:20,Teachers are rated so low in our society that economists are invited to discuss school reopening while they are sidelined. And people wonder why there is a teacher shortage?
2021-06-22 16:26:47,"For admission in September, all schools should require COVID vaccination for all students age 12 and above (as well as staff members).  That includes Junior High Schools, High Schools, and Colleges.
If this is done uniformly across the country, we will have herd immunity, and we can defeat COVID.
This is a national emergency, and everyone needs to do their part."
2021-06-22 15:45:44,"We as a society must understand that our public health response to the pandemic was an utter failure.  Pseudoscience “data driven” arguments that we should have taken even fewer public health measures are decidedly not helpful. We should be mourning our incalculable losses, and caring for victim’s families by learning the lessons of the Pandemic and preparing for the next one. We should be preparing and acting on climate change now. 
Instead we are making spurious arguments in favor of personal freedoms, family choice, and citing data that flies in the face of the fact that so many Americans needlessly died, more than in any other country in the world. 
The lesson of the pandemic is humility. We must work together to learn the proper lessons. The alternative is chilling, for all of humanity.  This woman needs to learn humility, as do all of her passionate readers."
2021-06-22 15:56:52,"It appears that so many of these commenters are filling in the information that Dr. Oster has shared with their own anxieties, personal experiences and misogyny.  Even the title of this article ignores the complexities of her identity as a working mother, wife, author etc. and restricts her to ""good"" or ""bad,"" ""hero"" or ""villain"" as is so often done to women in a public space.  Dr. Oster's work around school re-opening does not comment on the state of various public schools or the inequities families face because those are not the reasons that schools were closed this year and those issues will well outlast the pandemic.  This article is about her responding to one policy question which is that closing schools was important to keeping children safe and stopping community spread.  Her own evidence, as well as the data collected across the country suggest otherwise.  Dr. Oster always does a great job of sharing the information without passing judgement on the decisions people make and that is why mothers have been drawn to her work for so long.  Any comments suggesting that she shamed parents or teachers for being scared are an inaccurate representation of her work and the message she has consistently shared during this time."
2021-06-22 17:14:35,"Schools with the capacity to test 100 percent of all kids and adults weekly were able to stay open with minimal fear of large outbreaks, even without six feet of distance at all times. All schools should have been resourced with adequate testing materials and personnel. When there is a positive test, the contact tracing within school is manageable. Schools with outdoor space or access to it have an easier time. Lots of schools did stay open and fared well."
2021-06-22 17:20:43,"The doctor of philosophy was originally required to have mastered all the available knowledge that anyone knew and had added to it. Over a century ago, that became impossible. By that time these degrees were applied to specialities but the candidates were still supposed to be familiar with knowledge across all disciplines or most. Sometimes these degree holders actually think that they are expected to be holders of all knowledge as well as of their specialties, when they are not. That’s when their ignorance can create unexpected results. The trouble is that their self esteem is weak and they compensate by never admitting to the limits of what they know."
2021-06-22 17:24:15,"Many commenters are focusing on whether schools should have reopened rather than on how Dr. Oster stepped in to fill a much-needed void in practical advice during the pandemic. Admittedly, I fall into the ‘certain set of parents, generally college-educated, liberal and affluent,’ but I’ve been following Dr. Oster’s advice for years and words can’t express how helpful I’ve found it to be. While she may not be an infectious disease expert or education administrator, she is superbly qualified to interpret studies and data, and I find that to be incredibly helpful, especially as the chorus of ‘follow the science’ people were not actually following the science in many cases. Dr. Oster was."
2021-06-22 17:10:25,"Oster’s parenting arguments  fall flat in lived experience. Oster had a young child at the time of her book, i believe. But thats not much time in the trenches to give her “data” actually utility. Sounds like this is her pattern."
2021-06-22 15:55:02,It's one thing for scholars to follow hunches -- to turn them into research questions to explore. It's another thing to have an agenda and dig up data to prove your position. That's not scholarship. It seems to me Oster is more of a propagandist than a scholar.
2021-06-22 15:55:20,"I have no cat in this hissy-fit, but there are striking elements in this assessment of Dr. Oster.

First, you describe her as very much like He Who Shall Not Be President (Again) ""...many parents were drawn to her clear and consistent opinions"".

Little attention paid to the impact of what Doc has to say, it just feels good to find authority figures who speak with authority.

Not like Fauci, bouncing around the decisions list whenever there's more knowledge.

Now Oster has found the limelight and income that attends such certainty, I'm sure we'll get more.

Then there's Em's Pick-and-Choose, a fun game of make-a-point, support it with numbery evidence, use the new reality to assign (or imply) blame and ignore political, economic, social facts on the ground.

For example, ""schools must open or our children will die horrible death after lifetimes attending the Super-4-Load Magic Wash machine at the laundromat"".

Apparently there's much evidence in support of this assertion, and it's logical to blame whoever's in power: Democrats.

So the world explodes in rehearsals of the fundamental awfulness of not-private-or-charter schools, lazy/greedy teachers (excluding Oster, one presumes), unions...liberals...uncaring parents...

Never considered are legitimate reasons not to rush opening.

As Emily says, not everything is amenable to numberization: there lies the fairyland of researcher interpretation/conjecture, never identified as such in this hyper-sciencey arena."
2021-06-22 16:21:09,"Any responsible researcher, and every single statistician would heave Doc zoster out of the academy.  I know I would.

But now she’s cult figure, a guru-lite for those who love their own opinions to death.  Evangelicals, some call them in a slightly different venue.

And, wouldn’t you know, she’s an economist.

Of course she is.

Hey Doc, my little girl has this rash spreading on her knee.  How much would a conscientious consumer invest in a medicinal treatment?"
2021-06-22 15:41:40,"This is an article about a data analyst.  The article makes the following assertion, and seems tainted by it: ""This steady stream of counterintuitive advice has made Dr. Oster a lodestar for a certain set of parents, generally college-educated, liberal and affluent.""    Is there any data supporting this assertion?  Why does the author believe this?   My reading of the article is that the author somehow believes Dr. Oster's advice is somehow more relevant to the ""college-educated, liberal and affluent"" but nothing about the topics seems to differentiate among those characteristics.  That someone ""feels"" Dr. Oster's analysis of the data is wrong doesn't make it wrong.  I don't believe the author understands that."
2021-06-22 15:56:07,"Oster relies on logic to come to her conclusions? Yes, please let’s do. 

If your local school board is meeting via Zoom
to decide school openings because it is too dangerous for them to meet in person, then it is too dangerous to send teachers and children into school. 

That’s logic 101. Class dismissed."
2021-06-22 16:43:25,"She's not the only person who held this opinion! It was not a unpopular position! only the most ardent followers of Eric Feigl Ding or folks with a political agenda wanted to keep schools closed. The WHO, UNICEF all advocated for children to be in schools. And much of Europe opened schools or had much shorter closures. Many states in the US kept schools open and data showed they did not result in outbreaks. Her position was backed up by so many epidemiologists, pediatricians, and then the CDC. Seriously, it is now June 2021, is NYT still debating on whether we should've opened schools sooner? Please."
2021-06-22 16:52:32,"Would love to read an article about Whitney Robinson, an actual epidemiologist with specific expertise in this area, and her professional opinion on the subject of opening schools. The idea that her expertise here was reduced to commentary on Emily Oster's egotistical hobbyism is so maddening."
2021-06-22 16:46:16,"As a group, School age children, 51.5 million of them in the US, had 10.4% of all cases but only 308 deaths as of 6/21/21. Total child deaths from COVID so far: 462 out of 71 million. School age child deaths in the normal year of 2019 were about 9,500, all causes. COVID hasn't been a significant risk for children; one in 153,000 of their age group died. 
Let's look at it another way. Of those children who did contract COVID (3.4 million cases), 99.986% survived. Aside from relatively few complicated, comorbid cases, children do better than any other age group. And, only about 4.8% of all kids, got the bug even though Mom and Dad got over half of all cases, and brought it home.
Parent age adults are carriers, and resist masking. Why do they do that? Those under 50 had 54% of all cases, but a low 4.8% of all covid deaths. They just don’t have a window on the deaths. If they became sick, 99.84% of them survive. Of their 140 million cohort, there were 23,130 deaths, equal to one in 6,000 of their age group. Versus 463,000 for those over 49. You can perhaps understand, although perhaps not forgive, their perception that for themselves, this is just another flu. 
The decision as to whether to open schools lies not with the children and their COVID risk, which is very low. It lies with the degree to which parents and the teachers represent active carriers of the disease.  The numbers don’t show catastrophic child COVID risk.

2021-06-22 17:07:47,"It’s great that people with lots of resources have this additional resource to optimize slightly the trajectory of their sure-to-succeed kids.  I feel certain it will have an impact, however slight.
Note to the world - working class parents are not living for their salaries or jobs, they are doing everything for their kids and families.  So when they play it as safe as possible and keep their kids home, we should be neither surprised nor critical.  Instead, being supportive of these folks who are putting family ahead of all else would be a good place to start.
Working class folks - after the incarcerated and those in managed care facilities- have taken the biggest blows from infection by COVID 19 - and many of them kept going to work in spite of the danger they knew they were faced with on the job.
So it’s great to have a discussion that starts from where those with money are standing.  Let’s just be sure we also start a discussion from where everyone else is standing."
2021-06-22 16:25:28,Count me among the ones who thinks she is dangerous.
2021-06-22 16:34:41,"My grandchildren stayed safe while schools were closed. The Republicans running the county were wild to reopen the schools.Within 2 weeks of reopening, all 3 kids got the virus.

We do not know whether Covid is like chickenpox and rheumatic fever, diseases that are usually mild in children but lead to severe illness or death years later.

Regrettably, if this doctor is wrong, she will not be the one paying the price. Whether she turns out to be correct or not, she is arrogant, ignorant and reckless."
2021-06-22 17:11:14,"This story encapsulates everything that is wrong with the US today. The resistance to Dr. Oster’s data is not based on facts or even opinions. It is based on feelings. One teacher’s declaration “I feel unsafe!” trumps megabytes of data and years of research. Telling somebody that their emotions are irrational or irrelevant is tantamount to an assault or at the very least, a “micro-aggression”. Well, sorry, but your feelings ARE irrelevant to risk assessment. If teachers are afraid to teach, they should find another occupation. Yes, there are anecdotes about teachers getting infected but the plural of anecdote is not data. And in any case, if you vaccinated, you have nothing to fear; and if you are an anti-vaxxer, you should not be allowed to teach in a public school anyway,"
2021-06-22 17:11:18,"Economists operate in a bubble with little care if  educators and staff die or become long haulers - the economy is all. I prefer to listen to public health experts and educators, then put real resources into keeping all safe."
2021-06-22 17:04:29,"This pandemic was difficult.  The one thing the pandemic made abundantly clear is that teachers’ unions care more about teachers than children.  And, that makes sense bc teachers are the unions’ constituents. But the decisions to keep most public schools closed were made at the expense and well being of children."
2021-06-22 16:44:17,"Privileged white folks are somehow, even in this day and age, shocked, shocked I tell you! that poor and minority communities don't have the same infrastructure, the same access to medical care, or simply space in their apartments to prevent diseases spread by close contact.  

Doubtless, like the police chief in the film Casablanca, Ms. Oster will collect her earnings and go somewhere safe, leaving the rest of us to deal with what she will doubtless call unintentional errors.  People will get sick, some will die, but she'll be fine.

Most folks wouldn't seek medical advice from their plumber, or ask their lawyer how to slope pipes correctly, but they'll take advice on how to open public schools from someone with no knowledge of how schools are constructed and run in urban environments.  

God save us from such well intentioned individuals."
2021-06-22 17:03:03,If I were a 60 year old school teacher in the early stages of a deadly pandemic I wouldn't be satisfied with data that suggested that teaching in person probably would not kill me.
2021-06-22 16:59:41,"Wonder how Dr. Oster feels about the recent declines in covid-19 cases and the newer variants- is it due to not being the flu season in America or is it because of the the injection of mRNA; can we should we expect cases to again increase come fall/late fall/and winter flu season in 2021/22. Check case #'s last summer and compare them to this year, and see how the case load appear. Seems to me it was low until the end of September 2020 and then increased dramatically thru October/November, December ect. into 2021. Was it the holidays? Think not. What do you think? 

From the CDC : 'How long does the vaccine last for covid -19?' (Updated June 15, 2021)
""We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated.""

One can write the same type of 'arguments'; mine 'assumptions' are based of actual statistics., and are not 'wrong', yet do they carry the weight that there is more to this virus than we know.
This is why we have to be very very cautious on what we are doing and going on about.

Britain(CNBC- JUN 14 2021)
""Restrictions were due to be lifted on June 21.

New figures from Public Health England indicate that 42,323 cases of the delta variant of the coronavirus have now been confirmed across the U.K., an increase of 240% from last week.

And still what about the children from infancy to 12 years for now and going forward? We don't know nor have these answers. 

Money appears to be the vaccine for our actions."
2021-06-22 17:33:19,"The decisions must be supported by the data, or, at a minimum, optimally informed public discussion about how to treat uncertainties.  

There should have been debate in Congress and State Legislatures regarding the acceptable level of risk in reopening. But, as far as I am aware, there hasn't been any comprehensive  attempt by CDC to quantify the risks of reopening vs not doing so. We haven't heard any data driven discussion of ""acceptable risk"".  We hear about Covid deaths  and suicides from lockdown, for example, but we don't know the numbers and we never discuss the trade-offs.  

So,  I'm glad there's someone trying to use the data to talk sense. 

But, I also know that there is no substitute for experience. Anyone who has made decisions based on a layman's reading of technical material in an unsettled science  knows that it's easy to miss something vitally important."
2021-06-22 17:40:58,"I'm not suprised to discover kids grow up fine without breastfeeding and are born fine if Mom had a glass of wine once during her pregnancy. Why should I be surprised that her data shows surprising results about classroom density and masking? Many such studies might be done under different conditions, among different populations and in different regions. The more data, the better for all of us."
2021-06-22 17:41:30,"A few things about the ""should we have reopened the schools"" debate stand out:  (1) people complain about how poorly students learn virtually but half these people have kids who get C's while in-person and they don't bat an eye...this tells me that they don't really care about whether their child is learning; (2) those who say that being virtual was terrible for their kids' mental state (I don't doubt it was; the pandemic was very stressful for everyone), seem to ignore how attending school can be terrible for the mental health of other kids who are bullied and lonely; again, this tells me that they're less concerned with finding a solution to childhood mental stresses, than with finding solutions to their own stresses; (3) since when did anyone think that ANY solution would be ideal for every child?  School as we know it isn't ideal for every child either.  There is no right answer here--we were in a pandemic, something unprecedented in our lifetimes that completely turned life upside down.  Decisions were made with about a million different variables to consider, not the least of which was death.  You can't even compare schools from one city to the next, much less across the whole huge country, so let's please stop pretending that any of us had ""the"" answer.  We had preferences based on our own risk profiles, and our own varying personal abilities to empathize with others."
2021-06-22 17:44:11,"I have graduate degrees in economics and mathematics and work in public health. Upon starting my job, I quickly learned that the statistical methods I had learned as an economics major were wholly inadequate to deal with problems in public health. I went back to school to learn more appropriate methods. The traditional economics curriculum of experimental statistics, econometrics, and time series analysis has major weaknesses when it comes to analyzing and understanding complex, nested, multifactor datasets. The economists I know (and I know a lot of them) are wholly concerned with endogeneity and never think about issues such as clustering, mediation, moderation, or the usefulness of random effects. They live in a world where fixed effects and linear time trends are the rule, and anyone who disagrees must be from one of the ""soft"" social sciences. As a result, I never trust an economist when they try to model social phenomena outside of strict economics, because they always get it wrong. And they get a lot of economics wrong, too."
2021-06-22 13:48:54,"Words 3 and 4 of the article are all we really need to know about Oster's expertise on covid. ""an economist"". Not an expert."

2021-06-22 16:35:33,"I wonder what her renowned colleague Ashish Jha, Harvard MD, MPH, formerly of the Harvard faculty and now Dean of the Brown School of Public Health, and whose undergrad degree is in Economics from Columbia, thinks of Emily Oster's work?"
2021-06-22 17:26:04,"Rule breaking is needed for any real progress else we all live on a flat earth forever. Considering how sloppy the communication from health experts has been and continues to be, please stay out of your lane Dr. Oster. We're grown ups. We can handle it."
2021-06-22 16:57:49,"“I am always out of my lane,”

Meaning she holds forth on matters about which she know little to nothing."
2021-06-22 17:13:31,"There is not a shred of data that contradicts her position on this subject. The ""controversy"" is not about facts or science , but rather tribal politics."
2021-06-22 17:16:28,"if you simply focus on frequency of occurrence your conclusions are potentially quite suspect. Places that look like health farms may well be high risk areas when other more confounding factors are taken into account. The history of research into radiation risk is a prime example of initial and historically on going blanket statements about very low human risk to low level exposure that have later had to be revised upwards to show considerable low dose risk. Applying the same caution to Coivd risk numbers one is not surprised to see initial regulatory body conservative approaches to risk and human health that are at odds with broader frequency tables. Apply that circumstance to schools and you have an explosive situation.  What may appear to be a slam dunk conclusion can later turn out to be just plain wrong or in shades of risk depending on circumstances.  I don't know if you can say ""when it is all over"" but we can say that as experience and research continues we will have a better picture of who got sick or did not get sick when and under what circumstances. Part of the challenge is to deal with extremes like Trump's hate and pollicization of a public health crisis as well as data accumulators like Dr. Oster who reach broad conclusions on questions whose answers are evolving every day."
2021-06-22 17:25:32,"The fact that an economist giving data-driven advice about a topic that abuts (and directly overlaps in some ways with) her field of expertise is a ""villain"" to many points to the anti intellectualism and irrationality that now seems to characterize the ideological wings of both political parties."
2021-06-22 17:19:33,"It's easy to understand why someone like Dr. Oster would be listened to by the achieving class. There was an absence of guidance from the CDC and the federal government, just when we needed leadership. In stepped a smart woman with a PhD who told confused and scared parents what to do in no uncertain terms. 

In  hindsight, she (and Trump) was right that schools should have been opened. But NO ONE could say that last September. 

It's good that Dr. Oster is realizing she needs to understand how POC of middle- and working-class parents feel, which differs from her Ivy League peers. Live and learn."
2021-06-22 13:51:48,"The novel coronavirus was a brand new thing not that many months ago.  We have made a lot of progress understanding it and limiting its transmission in that short time, less on actual treatment.  Much progress was based of things we knew before - basic science that allowed rapid vaccine development, parallel situations the world has encountered before.

 But covid was a new thing and it took some time to get a handle on it; there still seems to be a lot we don’t know or understand.  

Along the way, untested and sometimes conflicting advice was advanced (masks, hand washing, quarantine, surface sterilization).  Some of these things turned out to be beneficial, some unnecessary.  But the impact of handling something deadly and new on the fly, and the advancement of theories which sometimes turned out to be wrong, opened the door for confusion and scepticism among the public which has been preyed upon by those with an axe to grind, especially politicians.

Covid was a great new tool employed by conservatives in their endless battle against teachers’ unions, as a rallying cry for those who just don’t like to be told what to do, for quacks and snake oil salesman of every stripe.

Schools? Open ‘em! Close ‘em! Burn ‘em to the ground! Less science! More religion! The illusive truth is lost in the shuffle as covid becomes a timely and powerful excuse to stir the pot of an already messed up educational “system”."
2021-06-22 17:22:33,"She wades into THE most hysterical public conversations (Covid, school closures, breastfeeding) and tries to actually speak from data. I, for one, found it incredibly helpful, even when I found the information inconvenient. I respect that she’s not yielding to politically charged extremists, but is actually trying to help. Surely that’s worth something."
2021-06-22 17:35:54,"Hindsight is 20/20 for those making tough decisions in the heat of the moment, I have incredible sympathy for people in those no win situation. No matter what was determined someone wasn't going to like it.  

The data we lacked drove decisions for people to typically side on the side of caution.  Our numbers in the general population here spiked after schools opened.  Weekly we got informed of new quarantines of potential exposures as kids tested positive in our schools.  We don't know the long-term impacts of the virus still.  People may have reactions years in the future, children may have issues that aren't apparent today.  Much of the data that suggested re-opening schools was safe, was based on children testing positive and not on latent spread by the children.  Sure children had little to no symptoms but we don't know anything about asymptomatic spread by children to household members or others.  This said, I understand why many schools chose safety for their staff, students, and community over staying open.  No one, knew the right answer, it was and remains a risk balance.  If it's your job to protect the safety of your employees and students and community, what choice would you make.  I am just glad I didn't have bear that burden."
2021-06-22 13:34:33,"Dr. Oster is up against the ""What if"" and ""What about"" syndrome.  What if a person catches the virus?  What about that one person who....?"
2021-06-22 17:44:08,"Emily Oster is the poster child of how one should think about a disease. By basing her views on the known science combined with math and statistics, she developed remarkably accurate models and prognoses for what we should be doing vis-a-vis schools. If only more people, especially it seems those on the left and the right, would trust the science."
2021-06-22 17:47:25,"One of the greatest tragedies of Covid is the fact that rich kids stayed in schools (without any uptick in Covid illness/death) and poor kids stayed at home in front of screens. Now, poor kids are even at a greater disadvantage because they've been getting sub-par education for a year."
2021-06-22 17:51:33,How does the class size at her Kid’s private school compare to the typical class size of a public school in Chicago or LA or El Paso? How does the ventilation system compare? How about the size of the cafeterias? Her kids probably have every advantage we could list.
2021-06-22 17:59:37,"Regardless of one's specific opinion of Dr. Oster, it seems very clear from following this discussion, including the comments here but also on social media, for example, that a lot of people are having a very hard time admitting they weren't 100% correct in the level of precautions they took and continue to take this pandemic. At the beginning, it was hard to know whom to trust, and the Trumpers/Republican-types who made light of the pandemic were clearly wrong in their dismissive attitude towards it, and it was easy to be right in comparison to them. Now, after many people got on their pandemic high horse (and they were right in many instances, and I was also someone who took a lot of precautions and is still relatively cautious) they are having trouble dismounting. There's no doubt that many districts and countries managed to keep kids in school safely. While people accuse Dr. Oster of being privileged, we should also consider that it's the privileged kids who were and will be least negatively impacted by remote learning. The tradeoffs in terms of schooling are enormous, *especially* for families where parents need to go to work and kids don't have the support they need at home for remote learning. It was very frustrating to watch our society prioritize bars over schools."
2021-06-22 18:30:23,In all this back and forth discussion about whether schools should have been open or not I've only seen concerns about the effects on the kids and potential spread amongst them - very little about the teachers and staff who are being told to be there and be exposed. I'm all for having the teachers there if they can be tested weekly at no cost to them and they are first in line for vaccination. Otherwise we have no moral basis to push people into a risky situation just for the sake of their children. It's all pie in the sky talk because few public schools considered doing these things.
2021-06-22 18:20:46,"I find it infuriating that in so many of these conversations it's taken for granted that kids should be in school when schools are often unhealthy places for children. Further, the pandemic has highlighted the terrible condition of schools in poorer neighborhoods, which parents are understandably less inclined to send their kids to during a pandemic. 

We should have been using the pandemic to rethink schooling in America. Instead, economic and parental day care interests have conspired to make us uncritically accept the idea that kids are all better off in school.  We fail to consider pertinent information, for example, that suicide and suicide ideation increases among children who are in school.  See, <a href=""https://upnight.com/2021/02/23/warning-schools-can-be-hazardous-to-health-and-happiness-dont-rush-to-send-your-kids-back"" target=""_blank"">https://upnight.com/2021/02/23/warning-schools-can-be-hazardous-to-health-and-happiness-dont-rush-to-send-your-kids-back</a>/"
2021-06-22 18:37:12,"What is great about Emily Oster is that she understands the need to balance risks and rewards, costs and benefits.

We forget that many professions will err on the side of what they are tasked to do (e.g. a public health expert focuses on keeping people safe, or a business leader might focus on keeping the economy healthy).  They don't take into account the full picture--that isn't their job.  It's good that they bring that knowledge, but we need to remember that a public health expert is giving advise on what is best solely from a ""minimize health risks from COVID"" perspective.  It's not their job to take into account the impacts on people of economic harm, social isolation, future harm from lost schooling, etc.

Same with, say, a business leader or someone advising politicans on economic health.  It's not their job to say what the best overall decision is.  It's their job to explain what the best decisions are from the perspective of economic health.

Emily did a great job of balancing pros and cons.  Yes, COVID needs to be taken seriously, but there are risks in life, so we can't aim for a zero-risk situation.  Protecting ourselves from COVID had very real costs, including economic insecurity, housing insecurity, loss of education, social isolation.  She helped bring those things into the discussion.  How do you balance the risks of COVID with the risks of social isolation, or economic harm, etc?"
2021-06-22 17:37:10,"She's not an MD.  She's not an epidemiologist.  She sends her children to private schools that have the money to put in various safeguards.  She has enough money and time to care for her children if they were to become ill with COVID19.  Many parents do not have those luxuries and those parents include some making high incomes. 

Therefore it's understandable that parents and teachers who are parents, might prefer remote learning.  In addition, there were many people who didn't want to wear masks even to protect themselves.  If I were a teacher and I had anyone in my family whose immune system was compromised I wouldn't want to have been teaching in person this year either.  

Dr. Oster may be correct on the facts.  But facts and emotions are two different things.  In the US there is an attitude of ""I can do whatever I please, it's a free country"".  In other words, many will not tolerate discomfort for the sake of others safety or well being.  

Data isn't everything when it comes to people, only when it comes to physics (and even there politics gets in the way)."
2021-06-22 18:18:52,"Our school district could have had kids back in school long ago.  For most of the pandemic, residents were extremely conscientious, were largely able to work from home, and the infection rate was 1-2 per 100K per day until last Christmas.  But, we also have one of the highest vaccination rates now.  I didn’t need her data or the CDC’s recommendation to know it was fine.  

We were the anomaly, however.  Families in cramped quarters with multiple essential workers in poorly ventilated schools and with many obese, diabetic, unhealthy adults is very very different than our situation and the situation of those to whom this woman is speaking."
2021-06-22 12:25:06,Good for her. I hope she runs for political office.
2021-06-22 13:02:03,"Well she was right. Covid wasn’t spreading in schools. Teachers’ unions kept schools closed even after the science became apparent. 
Teachers unions do not make decisions based on what is best for students. Covid made that incredibly obvious."
2021-06-22 15:08:32,"I think it’s important not to project thoughts and feelings on Dr. Oster that are inspired by the understandable anxiety, confusion and justified anger we all feel over the pandemic and the government’s incompetence in dealing with it. Yes it’s likely she doesn’t understand working class parents lives and the disruption that the pandemic has caused them. Nor does she have a working knowledge of the schools that their children attend or the working conditions of the schools staff. But that doesn’t make her entirely wrong or some of her data and conclusions incorrect. Right now I’m more troubled by the educational and health care systems denial of the growing pandemic driven childhood and adolescent mental health crisis. I know, I’ve got a granddaughter (under my care) whose education and emotional health has been damaged by the pandemic and our collective response. Neither the public school system here in Ann Arbor Michigan nor the mental health services associated with Washtenaw County or the university of Michigan are willing to acknowledge much less plan to address these concerns. We need to stop arguing over this and who was right or wrong (among people operating in good faith) and address the growing crisis of our children’s health and welfare, please….."
2021-06-22 17:17:22,"An economist, coming from a privileged background and current life circumstance, pontificating and touting data based ""meta-studies"" in areas completely unrelated to her formal education and training.

Are we really that desperate for guidance? Really?"

2021-06-22 18:34:56,"It seems to me that there are two problems here:

1. As noted, the recommendations were badly skewed by the study’s having focused on the privileged, at least at first.

2. It’s kinda blind, and maybe even irresponsible, to have thrown the recommendations out there like this. Why? 

Because a lot of people were looking (and still are) for excuses to do as they please, and to yell at anybody they see as lefty at all.

And because a lot of people blew right by the “if,” part, as in, “You can run face-to-face classes pretty safely, IF you test a lot, upgrade the ventilation, and take simple precautions such as masking.”"

Public health guidance is aimed at people who don't think ... for whatever reason ... it has to be simple. 

Example? ""Don't nuke baby bottles."" 

At 4 a.m., a hungover dad might accidentally scald a baby if he did heated a bottle in the microwave too long. In reality? The message is more nuanced, ""Don't nuke breast milk. If you nuke a bottle of formula, shake it and test it for temperature.""

Our nation is in a crisis of stupidity, where the belligerently ignorant look for anything to discredit the experts. People want to throw out all of Dr. Fauci's EXCELLENT public health advice because he privately gives nuanced advice to individuals capable of abstract thought. 

The denunciations of Mao's Cultural Revolution can't hold a candle to todays world. We are better off than the Inquisition, as we aren't burning people at the stake. Still, I am very glad to be retired."
2021-06-22 18:38:34,"Breastfeeding isn’t overrated. And it’s alluded to here in a very flippant way.  It’s actually a health crisis that more women aren’t getting the emotional support or education/training they need on the medical, financial and emotional benefits for their own bodies that might help more women achieve it. Instead, formula companies fanned the flames and created an anti-narrative to pit women against each other and create a space for women like Dr. Oster to trash it or dismiss it when in reality it’s got incredible long term benefits that have nothing to do with allergies or bigger brains but more to do with mom and baby’s health down the road. Even if we supported  women to feed for 3-4 weeks, thus eliminating all of the challenges for working moms it would be worth it. So sick of people sidelining this issue because a patriarchy and big business created a war between women."
2021-06-22 18:45:01,"An economist with no degree in public health, medicine or statistics gathers data produced voluntarily on a non-randomized basis, then claims to be providing a source for data driven decision-making?

Let me translate that:

An amateur in at least three fields scrounges seemingly plausible data, puts it into some sort of non-normalized database and then provides it to parents to make health-related decisions for their children.

That's what I call ""seemingly plausible data.""  Check out Abbott and Costello's ""7 X 13 = 28"" video on Youtube for a similar illustration of ""seemingly plausible data"".  

Oh, one more thing:  If this amateur in at least three fields makes a mistake in her data and someone's child is hurt, does she have the resources to pay for any personal injuries, even those COVID illnesses of a lifetime basis?"
2021-06-22 19:00:02,"This act has been done to death. A well-known person proclaims that the things everyone knows are true (for example, that women should not drink during pregnancy) aren't true at all.

Oster puts herself out there as a truth-teller. All the others like her that who before did the same thing, except Oster puts a twist on it by leaning into ""the data."" Give me a break.

I doubt it will be a comfort to the people burying the dead to know that their loved one's death was statistically insignificant.

It's funny how easy it is to convince some people that flattery and pandering are truth-telling, but the stuff that advises caution and causes inconvenience is a lie."
2021-06-22 18:32:02,"It's frustrating to see the public's perpetual ignorance of what academic economists actually do, both in terms of research scope and methodology. I blame the oversimplications presented in introductory econ courses and the fiscal policy speculation that occupies the public economics consciousness. The lines between computational social science disciplines are vanishingly small, and most of the techniques used in public health research to assess policies using observational data were first popularized in economics, so to characterize her as out of her depth is laughable."
2021-06-22 18:46:53,"She might be able to read data due to her education in economics, but she is absolutely not qualified to speak specifically on impacts regarding COVID-19 data since she was not trained specifically for medical issues. I will never trust anyone to read me a bunch of data and give me their conclusions if they don't have any actual and relevant qualifications, such as relevant degrees, to do so."
2021-06-22 18:54:48,"The only correct answer to the question 'should kids return to schools during a pandemic?' is, 'it depends'. As with all economists, Dr Oster is focused on the numbers but numbers are as subject to bias as language and there is always nuance behind the data that you have to match up to real-world conditions. 

Real-world conditions in a private, well-resourced, small schools with well-heeled parents who work in low-risk at-home jobs (university faculty, for example...) are very different to real-world conditions in a low-income, large public school with 35 students crammed in each classroom and parents who are in high-risk jobs with older family members living in the same household. Unless Dr Oster's data reflected this range of real-world conditions, it won't have provided helpful answers to the question 'should kids return to school during a pandemic?'"
2021-06-22 18:53:46,"We keep hearing that ""science"" should drive decision making.  But we only hear that from people who want the science to agree with their decisions, and they disparage the science when they don't like conclusions based on good science.  Oster is simply using science to make decisions in the best way."
2021-06-22 18:52:32,"Hello from Vancouver, Canada. Our elementary schools have been open all year. The kids are happy to go to school, the parents very happy they do. The teachers: they showed up; perhaps early on with some worries, but they found as the year went on that our public health officers and our government were right: schools are a very safe place. We know exactly who is going in every day. A couple of times in the last 10 months a class was asked to stay home for 2 weeks, as one of the students had been in contact with someone with Covid. But no school-related contamination."
2021-06-22 19:13:14,I got it that since the beginning of the pandemic she has collected a vast data that schools and other sources have submitted to her group for analyses.  What I want to know if there are statisticians and epidemiologists who are her research collaborators or if her research grad school  students helping her with the data and providing statistical interpretation.  Has she submitted her research findings to her fellow peers for review and publication or those findings are intended only for her newsletter updates and her books for concerned parents?
2021-06-22 19:24:06,Loved her baby and pregnancy books because they were premised on giving readers pros and cons of things and giving the parents room to make their own decisions. I don’t think she should be telling us whether to send our kids to school or whether we should be reopening schools.
2021-06-22 19:23:46,"I'm a mom and have read some of Emily Oster's work. There is so much pressure on moms to do all of the right things and she is trying to cut through that and say it's okay to not do everything perfectly - that there are costs and benefits to every decision. 

This paragraph is spot on: ""The same was true during the pandemic, Dr. Oster noted. “I’d get questions like, is it better to have my in-laws watch my kid or send them to day care?” she said. “We’ve been told to do neither, but that isn’t a choice” for working parents.""

Messaging during the pandemic was very politically polarizing and on the extremes - ""don't form small pods with close family and friends because you could kill them!"" or ""covid isn't real so go ahead and have 100 person events!"" We needed a middle ground for the sake of our sanity! Some kids thrived in virtual school, others did okay, while others failed. We needed in-person school for some kids for their mental health. A 12 year old who lived near me who previously hadn't had mental health issues committed suicide this past fall during lockdown - COVID ultimately killed him. His death could have been avoided if we had had some classrooms opened this year."
2021-06-22 19:27:35,"Emily Oster is very intelligent but I am willing to bet that if she stood in someone else’s shoes for one day, her views would have been different. Ask a single mom/teacher who relied on high risk grandparents for child care during COVID. Ask a mom teaching preschoolers with Autism who couldn’t social distance or wear masks.
Emily sat in her basement in safe privilege while school/care workers had no choice but to risk exposure for very little money.
I wish she would use her brilliant economist brain to end structural inequity rather than counseling rich people on how to get free childcare via public school teachers."
2021-06-22 19:26:41,"My 11 year old son goes to school in Sweden. He - and all school children there nationwide - never missed a day of attendance in school and never wore masks in school - to this day. While The New York Times printed hyperbolic article after article on the front pages about Sweden’s management of Covid, Sweden’s infection and death rates were not worse than USA. Sweden has no evidence that keeping children in school was a mistake. Indeed, while there might be some spread in school, and some deaths might have occurred, the data indicate the risks were low, and Sweden decided the cost of keeping kids home was much greater than the cost of low transmission in schools. The USA entirely mismanaged the pandemic at every step, and the cost of keeping kids out of schools for a generation of children will be massive. MASSIVE. It was entirely unnecessary. I’m so grateful my son stayed in school the entire time. My sympathies to the parents and children who have had their lives so disrupted. The costs were massive with little - if any - upside to show for it."
2021-06-22 19:22:31,"Oster used data to make a fair-minded cost/benefit analysis on whether, on balance, closing schools was beneficial, as measured by criteria that most people deem important. The vitriol and smears against her are one manifestation of people being unable to accept that their school closing policies were unnecessarily harmful to children."
2021-06-22 19:30:39,"The criticisms of Oster here rehash all that was wrong about our response to the pandemic with regards to kids and school. (1) We shouldn't listen to an expert on risk assessment to help assess risks to children, especially if we don't like her conclusions. (2) We shouldn't use the data available to help inform our decisions, relying instead on our emotional responses. (3) Public schools in the US are different than any other schools in the world when it comes to risk and no interventions were even worth considering. (4) Ignore the warnings of any white/elite/coastal academic with regards to minority and lower-SES kids, even though those kids will suffer the greatest educational harm."

2021-06-22 19:20:27,"Dr. Oster's problem is her research and ideas run counter the desires of organized labor, aka the teachers unions. Democratic politicians are frightened to death of the unions and will let kids lose out on an education to satisfy the AFT and NEA. What better proof di you need when you see that private and parochial schools successully opened in Chicago in late August while the public schools remain essentially closed. Of cource the usual race baiting about people of color being somehow abused by being asked to go back to school is promoted by the unions.

As they say..Follow the money."

People like her are the problem, just like that quack all the anti-vaxxers latched onto years ago looking for a simple answer to a very complex issue (autism). She is as much of the problem  as the lemmings that follow individuals like her.  Use common sense folks.  As for Dr Oster,, Send your kids to your local Providence public school, not whatever private school you do, then talk to the rank and file parents who spend day in and out struggling to make the choices based on what they can and cannot afford and the health of their children."

The barstool guy is not an expert in any of the areas he opines about, either, thereby making him equally qualified as Oster. And I bet he’s got some pretty strong feelings about child rearing, breast feeding, and many other topics. Just let him get a couple drinks in him, and he’ll express them just as passionately as the subject of this article. 

Of course, we could simply refer back to Florida man’s opinions. A shot of bleach, anyone?"

An economist is a scientist that works with data, he or she is not a medical doctor. He or she works with risk management- her supporters are looking for someone to justify their frustrations with decisions made rightfully or wrongly by the authorities. Her data can’t capture all the intricacies that are involved in the public school system, their students, family dynamics, etc that may or may not influence Covid transmission. At best her analyses provide insight of the issues with public school."

I understand all schools couldn’t fulfill all those criteria so didn’t offer in person learning.  But Dr. Oster seems to do a better job of looking at the science and data and making meaning of it and actionable recommendations than just about anyone else out there.  I have read quite a bit of her work and it is reasoned, nuanced and refers to the data she has.  I understand fear, but don’t agree that fear should be a guiding principle."
2021-06-22 19:38:51,"The President abandoned his advisers, and intentionally provided no leadership, after the very beginning when he was telling people to inject bleach into their veins or take powerful drugs he knew nothing about. He never shared the details of the successful treatment he was given at Walter Reed.  Bored, he stepped back and turned the whole mess over to the various state governments, who were ill-prepared and ill-equipped to understand the Covid-19 virus, or its variants, or to deal with the enormity of the crisis facing them.  Fifty-plus separate approaches instead of one well-thought-out national plan of action. 

The CDC had not been funded properly or organized sufficiently to come together and work as a team that could understand the full extent of the crisis, could not assist in developing a vaccine, could not formulate or distribute a plan for a way forward as a nation, nor could it provide any other guidance that wasn't censored by political flunkies of the last administration. 

This economist analyzed the available facts using modern techniques, including reports of where outbreaks frequently occurred, and the age and health of the groups affected, as well as the reports about which groups were least affected. When elected leaders abandon leadership and bury their heads in the sands of partisan politics, how can one criticize those few who use their brains and training to size up the true situation and stand up and attempt to give guidance to those who needed it."

Dr. Oster is an economist, which is a field of study in the social sciences. These experts are required to know not much more than any member of the public respecting science, mathematics, and medicine. She is somebody who is expressing the feelings that she knows are true about subjects which she is effectively, ignorant. Ignorance is a grand thing. Since once does not know, one can believe what one thinks about what does not know with sincerity."
2021-06-22 19:37:59,Oster needs to be heard and acted upon. Sensible common sense must prevail. Our children have been badly hurt by being kept at home under misguided policies and overreaction. One suspects powerful unions were also behind these prolonged closures.
2021-06-22 20:04:52,"I am all for data driven decisions.  However, as far as COVID-19 goes, the data is dynamic and there is much we do not know.  It is arrogant to think otherwise.  The fact that what appeared to be symptomless adult patients are turning up months later with serious health issues should at least give pause to parents sending their young developing children out without proper protection.  I repeat, we do not know-it-all, even if Dr. Oster thinks she does."
2021-06-22 19:47:57,".05 centimeter from my PhD in social work, I have seen the desperation being constantly told your discipline is not a real science can produce.

It spreads like a plague, the Delta mutation, producing bizarre effects like trying to turn people into numbers, then pretending they’re still people after you do.

Or ignoring practice wisdom and the art involved in exceptionally effective practice because they’re difficult to standardize and package as “best practice”.

Sadly this obscures the immense value and often stunning success of well-considered social work interventions.  The ones psychologists steal and take credit for.

Always, through dreary sloughs of despondency, dour self doubt, dark nights of a doctoral student’s soul, one magnificent idea sustains me, one brilliant steadfast beacon gleams through the gloom, bringing strength, comfort, resolve: at least I’m not an economist."
2021-06-22 20:17:14,"Reading the hysteria voiced by some about the harm of not having in-person schools makes me wonder if people realize that schools as know them today are NOT some sort of an institution that has been around for thousands (or even hundreds) of years.  For the majority of human history going to school is not how most kids grew up--and yet grew up they did.  Calm down people.  Your kids were given an opportunity to learn, albeit virtually.  Is that an ideal way to learn?  No.  And guess what, neither is what we do in schools.  Are your kids impacted emotionally by this year?  Yes--like EVERYONE else.  Because we're in a pandemic and that is stressful.  Being kept away from the love of close grandparents probably had more of an impact on them than not going into a school--and yet it was a price that had to be paid to keep those grandparents from potentially dying.  This is a chance for kids to learn about empathy, hard choices, composure, and adaptability.  Are you modeling the right lessons for them?"
2021-06-22 20:03:24,"Dr. Oster’s intentions were pure at least. She’s a data-driven person and she believes numbers to be infallible. But the trouble is, schools rarely look like the data in reality.

The biggest risk to teachers during face-to-face instruction in the height of the pandemic came not from students but from other adults. Those schools that figured this out, many of them in my state, were able to stay open, keeping infections to a minimum by prohibiting parents and other non-employees from coming inside the school. Dr. Oster’s data didn’t communicate this, probably  because she has never worked in a school, never watched the flow in and out of delivery people and parent volunteers, all the potential for exponential virus spread, and that’s the reason it was hard for me to jump aboard her bandwagon."
2021-06-22 20:49:21,"This article doesn't mention some of the strongest evidence against Oster's views: the recent increase in covid cases in the UK, which are predominantly occurring in younger, unvaccinated populations.  Something similar happened in Michigan a few months ago.

Schools may or may not have been a major driver of the spread in the early part of the pandemic, but now, with vaccination widespread in older age groups in the US and UK but rare or non-existent in children, there is decent evidence showing spread in schools, especially where standard precautions aren't taken."
2021-06-22 20:52:45,"It’s easy to look back on decisions that worked out in your favor or to your expectations and decide that they were right. However at the time of action there was no way to know. 

So much happened day by day and week by week that we have had to forget the toil of constant life saving decision making and the deep uncertainty about what was necessary. 

Erring on the side of caution was reasonable and likely saved many lives."
2021-06-22 20:55:40,"It’s been interesting to see this same debate unfold in my town, where a small group mostly white, highly (over?)-educated parents have been exasperatingly shrill in their calls for a return to in-school learning without appropriate appreciation for the positions of educators and lower-income people. It was particularly galling that the loudest complainers were parents who themselves had the option to work safely from home."
2021-06-22 21:01:23,"Most of the families we know looked at all the facts available around June, 2020.  At that time, there was a reasonable amount of real-world evidence available that pointed to covid19 being a very low risk to people under 65 who were in great health.  The people in our neighborhood went on business-as-usual with social activities, youth sports, in-school activities.  To be courteous, everyone pretty much wore masks in public places. A ""Karen"" gave us some grief about being a risk to others. I explained, no - a person at risk from covid is the one who places themselves at risk by being near me.  I also explained that the only way I could be blamed for another person getting covid from me is if it coule be proven, beyond a doubt that the virus particles travelled me to them - those exact virus particles.  Otherwise - not my fault - they could have gotten it at the store or on the bus."
2021-06-22 21:07:14,"I've loved Emily Oster's work since her first book, and was really grateful that she put data forward about reopening. Our district stayed data driven, opened relatively early for younger grades and had basically no in school transmission cases, as Dr. Oster hypothesized. Thank you Dr. Oster for your great work for families and kids, and I will pre-order your next book and recommend it to friends as I always do!"
2021-06-22 21:16:31,"Thank you, Dr. Oster! In Washington State the schools only partially reopened due to an executive order by the governor. If he hadn't stepped in to stop the nonsensical talk about how unsafe reopening schools would be, we would still be all remote. Now we are in a hybrid model. We have known for a long time that schools can be reopened safely. We have also been reopening basically everything else in our society and economy for a long time now. But sadly, schools and teachers' unions have dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the actual risk."
2021-06-22 21:17:28,"Before you criticize her, did you actually read her research?  There is often a problem understanding and interpreting economic analysis and how it should translate to public policy.  The press often interprets the results of research incorrectly.  Policy makers often opportunistically rely on anything that supports their position without understanding the limitations of the research.  
Sometimes that leads to bad outcomes, but it is good to try to look at the data.  
Controversy  helps to sell books, so maybe she likes that and oversells her research."
2021-06-22 20:24:19,"Gosh, there are a lot of people in this thread who are trained in neither epidemiology nor economics opining on the proper role of each field. What matters when looking at this retrospectively is that Oster has been vindicated on all of the big questions about kids and covid. The schools that were open and took basic precautions -- cheap and easily verified stuff like requiring masks! -- saw vanishingly little in-school transmission. And remote schooling has caused a mental health crisis (including a pediatric psychiatric state of emergency in my state of Colorado), contributed to a juvenile crime wave, and led to who knows how much lost educational attainment. Progressives have invested the field of public health with a sort of mystical authority while totally ignoring that public health practitioners themselves moved closer to Oster's position on in-person schooling over the past year. My own tribe of progressives has so dug into a permanent April 2020 mindset that it can't acknowledge that restrictions of course involve tradeoffs and that public health decisions are ultimately political decisions, not rules mechanistically dictated by Science."

While they may offer insights how to interpret aggregated data, they are like the rest of us needing to make a living selling “something”.  They are NOT the kind of profession needed in the middle of a pandemic."
2021-06-22 20:34:46,"If Dr. Oster combined her insights with medical research and some on the ground reporting and interviews with students and parents and teachers, her insights would be pressure-tested a bit more and we’d get a bigger picture. Working in her economic and privileged silo makes her data narrow, her ability to come up with nuanced solutions impossible."
2021-06-22 20:43:14,"She is conducting biomedical research using the same primitive and unreliable approaches and tools that economists use to conduct economic research.  Not surprising since she is trained as an economist.  

Before she begins to dabble in biomedical research she should be able to answer the following questions:
What does it mean to randomize subject in a trial and why is that important?
What is selection bias and how do you avoid it or compensate for it in your data analysis?
What does it mean that a trial is double blinded and why is it important?
What does ""placebo controlled"" mean and why is it important? 
What are the main concerns and flaws of observational studies?

If she could answer those questions and incorporate that knowledge into her studies, then we can take her ""research"" serious.  Otherwise, she is just an Economist getting way in over her head dabbling in biomedical science."
2021-06-22 21:10:09,"I think it’s fine for smart and informed people to ask hard questions and try to get at the root data behind public health guidance. 

But reading about a field where you have neither the training nor working experience is fraught with pitfalls. Just look at Trump’s economist, Peter Navarro. He has a PhD and was a total ignoramus on Covid AND economics. His retired neuroradiologist wasn’t much better. 

It’s also important to say once again that we all faced a novel, never seen before pathogen, and experts had to apply limited knowledge in hopes of limiting a highly contagious virus that appeared to be 10-20 times more deadly than your regular ’strenuous’ flu. 

The first priority was to limit the spread, limit the hospitalizations, and limit the body count from Covid. Most sentient people would err on the side of saving lives first. Not second guess the experts for publicity. 

And, sadly, since true herd immunity may elude us, this virus almost certainly won’t be going away. That means many of those so far uninfected and persistently against vaccination will eventually get it."
2021-06-22 21:05:55,"As a consumer, I wonder how Dr Oster would take to me using my experiences to offer opinions on economics and markets. Things like loans should go to those who most need the money, not to those who already have a lot of it. That a single store owner’s experience can be scaled up to any size without any changes to its methods. One store with twenty employees or a competitor to Walmart-its all the same. And so on."
2021-06-22 20:40:46,"We just completed a year of in-person learning in Barcelona. In fact, private and public schools both completed the year.

Ms Oster certainly makes compelling “data driven” arguments, but we don’t live in a rational “data driven” world. Rather we live in  messy soup of competing agendas, concerns, values, and vulnerabilities. 

So, good for her and the many nice white people with choices, but when fighting a deadly worldwide pandemic, we should never regret erring on the side of caution regardless of what the data tell us."
2021-06-22 21:05:38,"I had not heard of Emily Oster so I googled her two books. The book jackets say it all in my opinion with large quotes in bright colors that say things like: Safe drinking during pregnancy and Why gaining too much weight might be safer than gaining too little. Well who wouldn't want to buy the book? It sounds a lot more fun than following the orders of real doctors who spent ten plus years of their lives training to become Ob/Gyns. There's even a quote in bright pink that says that doctors ""fail to lay out the pros and corns of that morning latte."" I assume she means the cost."
2021-06-22 21:33:42,"I think data-driven is not always what it seems. Having conducted empirical research, I know there are many hidden choices. What data to collect, what population it represents, and so on. Her data, from the article, wasn't a random sample, rather it was a convenience sample - schools that chose to respond, which are more likely to be schools with more resources. Still, the bigger issues have to do with values. Whose lives are we going to value? Kids may be safe but they can transmit as we are now seeing. What about teachers and staff? You can come to different answers based on who you prioritize. And then, I always worry about people who aren't experts in the domain they are maing recommendations for."
2021-06-22 21:39:20,"She pitted parents against educators early on, when we still did not know the risks - in a profession with many high risk members who could not afford to take an unpaid leave & many in ‘at will’ employment states, with many schools not even requiring masking in significant parts of our country. 

We were told we were lazy, that we don’t care about our students, that we were selfish, that we are essential and therefore required to risk our health & lives. Current reports are showing brain damage in COVID survivors. 

The reality of our school buildings is that many of them are not capable of stopping airborne illnesses because of outdated HVAC systems and, as the article notes, windows that do not open or rooms without windows. I honestly am always curious why people think teachers are so powerful through the unions - if they were, we would have the most luxurious work environment ever. Instead we are underpaid and buy our own classroom supplies for other people’s children.

She set up a dynamic that made the teachers out to be uninformed, unreasonable monsters doing irreparable damage to students & their families. The CDC did nor reference peer-reviewed research showing it was airborne until this spring after teachers were vaccinated. Is it a surprise that the news is also showing 25% of educators are looking to quit or retire?"
2021-06-22 17:21:06,"I think looking at whatever data is available is helpful, but following it blindly seems silly, given that (a) the overarching theme of this era is one of great uncertainty, and (b) when people like Oster take the absence of data to make an inference that you can safely do X activity because we don't have data showing people get sick from X activity, they are making a huge leap without acknowledging it.  First, is someone actually looking for this data, such that the lack of data really has salience?  Second, when you get Covid, you don't get some time stamped GPS marker telling you when and where you got Covid.  You simply do not know one way or the other, and making an inference based on that lack of knowledge seems a bit silly.  I'm more interested in epidemiologists giving advice based on their understanding of how the virus spreads and works, than listening to some economist give advice based on the sort function on some random spreadsheet."

Precious few economists (almost all of them among ""salt-water"" faction) have even an adolescent's ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty.  In their philosophy, If it something is stated as a number, it must be true.

Economists do not understand economics, much less sociology, government, education, child psychology, politics, microbiology, epidemiology, physiology, public health, or even the statistics they are able  to (mis)use only because they have computers to make the mistakes for them.

There are so few helpful economists that the world would be better off without any of them messing up our lives.

2021-06-22 21:28:07,"All I gotta say about this is that virtually all other countries, many of whom had comparable or higher Covid cases and deaths per capita than the US, reopened their schools last year.

I’m a liberal in the ultra-liberal SF Bay Area, but I have to point out that blue states and districts stood virtually alone in the world in keeping its schools closed for so long. In SF there were zero deaths for weeks in March yet schools there didn’t open until late April. In early spring Washington state had lower case levels per capita than British Columbia right across the border, yet schools were open in the latter while schools in Washington remained closed.

We liberals like to claim we’re governed by science and evidence. But it’s been abundantly clear that schools were not major sources of Covid spread which is why schools reopened in most countries and states last year. On this subject many liberals have been guided by hysteria rather than science and evidence."
2021-06-22 21:31:28,"I'm a middle school teacher in a minority lower class school outside of Chicago. My school was remote the whole year. Sure in the spring we invited the special education, ELL, and low participating students back into the building. Very few took up the option. 

Those that did came into mostly empty classrooms and logged into Chromebooks to take part in the same Zoom session every other student did. Teaching in person and remotely simultaneously was extremely difficult. 

Why did so few students return? My students are from mostly Hispanic low income families with multiple generations living in the same home. A few of my students caught covid. Some had family that died from it. 

I was not opposed to schools reopening though, but I am very much opposed to a PHD in Economics who sends her children to private schools making any money with her advice.

How does an economist become an expert on pregnancy, parenting, viruses, and the public educational system? Who knew economic degrees were so versatile.

According to sources on the internet she has a networth of $1 to $5 million. How many parents of public school children can say the same? How many teachers in the building can say the same thing?

The arguments for fully reopening schools seems to be focused more on the economic impact this was having for white upper class people.

I wonder about her opinions on health care, college tuition, and the minimum wage.

Emily Oster is very much the villian. The internet won't forget."
2021-06-22 21:33:41,"Using a data-driven approach from an economist in making parenting decisions about a never-before-seen virus seems like a recipe for disaster. Does the data tell us anything when it hasn't been collected over time and large populations? Are the conclusions valid from an economist that doesn't have the expertise to really understand complicated medical ideas?  

The problem is that Dr. Emily Oster was and is using her position as an economist to make herself feel better about her own choices in her own life (it's the kindest explanation since the other explanation would be that she is an opportunist). She might not even realize her bias -- rationalization of our own behavior is a pitfall we all succumb to at times. Some parents love her advice because it makes them feel better about their own choices. It seems harmless until we bump up against a public health crisis. Then, it gest dangerous. She may have contributed to many children becoming ill and maybe even a few dying because she thinks it's cute to not stay in her area of knowledge and act like she is an expert in parenting and infectious disease. 

I feel like she is a symptom of the huge problem that is plaguing society -- everyone is just seeking out information that reaffirms their beliefs instead of what is true or admitting that there are no good answers YET. She is just the different side (the rich, white, educated, liberal side)of the Qanon/Big Lie/Anti Vaxx coin."

As the one responsible for keeping my school open or not this year, I read her faithfully this past year to gain perspective and insights. I also consulted regularly with parent physicians in my community working in Covid care, read exhaustively, and took the pulse of my community. Amidst great uncertainty and unclear facts, Dr Oster’s writings were immensely helpful in the way they integrated disparate data sources. She approached her topics with curiosity and an honest sense of her own fallibility.

She didn't deserve the vitriol directed at her."
2021-06-22 22:33:59,"I wonder about the data she used.

Half of the staff/faculty members who contracted COVID at my school ended up needing hospital care, although, not in the ICU, thank goodness. Still, 50% is high.

Two of those employees had been in a classroom with a student who contracted COVID, but they were still told that they could not have caught it from the student because they were wearing masks and were not within six feet of the student for more than 10 minutes (as if the virus just dies when it hits 6 feet). These teachers were being very safe outside of school and were not socializing outside of school hours. Their cases were listed as off-campus cases.

The other employees also did not know how they caught COVID. They assumed it was through asymptomatic students, but because there was no proof, no random testing of any students in the building ever, they were also considered off-campus cases.

Almost every child that goes to the early morning care program had COVID in their families within a timeline that suggests it was spreading asymptomatically through the kids in the program, but again, “no school spread.” 

My point is that school administrators and local health departments attributed cases to “community spread” instead of school spread when there was no proof either way about what contributed to the spread. The data this doctor used may be flawed."
2021-06-22 22:16:17,"I suppose I missed the step where Dr. Oster’s recommendations went directly into legislative action with no vetting or debate. Was she named supreme leader during Covid? Did she at any point gain real power beyond her substack audience? Because if not, everyone is free to ignore her, including parents, teachers, and doctors. 

I like Dr. Oster, I’ve enjoyed her work. I wasn’t following her during Covid, so this is all news to me, but not surprising. Someone operating from a completely unique and privileged set of circumstances, using her unique background and data set, comes to a unique opinion. Is that really so shocking? And critically, why get so mad about it? 

The tweets and other comments reported on here are oddly hostile to a woman with no authority to enact policy based on her positions. I’m honestly unsure what the vitriol is accomplishing."

If children have to sacrifice to keep teachers well and grandparents alive, that teaches a valuable lesson.  American children have had their resilience tested this year, and I think they rose to the challenge.  They have learned to sacrifice for others, something that many adults are not willing to do.  They will be better prepared to meet what life circumstances demand of them than the self centered elders."

Deciding whether to send a child to school is not a “medical decision” as so many people incorrectly pointed out. What Dr. Oster did is analyze risk. Her data eventually included a sample of a quarter of all schoolchildren in the US. The CDC and EU both eventually came to the same conclusion as she did, ie. that schools were never more dangerous than the community at large and that children are at incredibly low risk of of transmission, and folks still think she’s wrong. 

She’s gotten a lot more right than the epidemiologists who assumed Covid behaved identically in children and adults, or who for months were certain that fomite transmission was something to be concerned of. 

There’s a great deal of irony watching many comment about the rise of anti-intellectualism while in the same breath dismissing Dr. Oster’s data-driven, corroborated, empirical research. It’s no different than anti-vaxxers who rely on anecdotes instead of peer reviewed studies.

2021-06-22 23:26:24,"Sure, data is the answer, but what is the question?

Oster’s analysis is satisfactory to people wanting to know if schools are safe for children of a particular age.  Mostly that’s because cases have been less frequent and less severe in children.  However, tracing in the US was very patchy, many children are asymptomatic and didn’t get tested.  We’ll know more as data on long haul Covid continues to trickling in.

On thé other hand if you’re asking about schools contributing to the spread of Covid to the rest of the population, the data is much less conclusive.  Even Oster says: “we need more data to understand the relative rates of spread to household contacts for child and adult cases.”

Both questions are critical to making decisions.  Unfortunately people seem to prioritize one."

2021-06-22 23:36:00,"""Her data work was discounted by some teachers’ union activists because it was funded, in part, by philanthropies that support nonunion charter schools.""

Wrong. Her data was discounted by legitimate epidemiological researchers whose only agenda was the truth.  It is a shame when a newspaper tries to discredit very valid criticism of shoddy education research by attributing it to angry teacher unions.  

Even now, the data she hypes to justify a safe reopening seems to skew towards the most affluent schools.

During the height of the pandemic, Emily Oster was more interested in self-promotion than in patiently following the research and the truth.  In this, she was joined by the other economic researchers who signed on to the Great Barrington Declaration who were media and Republican darlings for their willingness to hype their claims that reopening was perfectly safe based on shoddy research using small data sets.

And this is not the first time that Emily Oster jumped to unwarranted conclusions.  In her dissertation, she made claims that got her praise from famous people and those who questioned were dismissed as ""having an agenda.""  It was only later, when other researchers gathered more data, that she had to retract her conclusions.  To her credit, she did eventually retract them, but paid little price for hyping conclusions that had little data to support them.  That is privilege."
2021-06-23 00:16:55,"Hm.
Wonder if she taught her courses for the past three semesters in a     classroom?
I suspect not, given the published protocols of her employer. She probably hasn’t set foot in a classroom herself in 15 months.
Wonder if she actually taught any of the courses where she’s listed as instructor, read students’ work and actually graded them?
Probably not. But she no doubt had teaching assistants who dealt with the technical issues of online instruction, who answered student emails, and read and graded their work while she swanned from op-Ed page to TV ‘expert’ on the pandemic.
But as a product of privilege, living in a bubble of privilege, cherry-picking who provides the raw material for her data sets, is it any wonder that she arrived at her conclusions?
I wouldn’t be bothered if she’d just been honest about who is the intended audience for her ‘research.’ It ain’t me, I ain’t no fortunate son."

My experience proved nothing. As a social scientist this person should know that sampling too small groups cannot provide population data that is significant. Yet, she makes assertions about safe and unsafe behaviors."
2021-06-23 00:11:50,"It’s been so frustrating as a pediatric infectious disease specialist to see an economist make pronouncements minimizing the risks to kids over and over again, even going as far to claim that a child is “like a vaccinated adult”. She keeps basing this claim on the low number of deaths in pediatrics, however, she makes light of the burden of hospitalizations and prolonged illness. We continue to see kids hospitalized every day with MIS-C and covid, including in the ICU. If she actually had the personal experiences that those of us in children’s hospitals have had, she would think of the risks differently. Even a few days ago she claimed that severe illness is “extremely rare”in kids. She keeps saying this. It’s not true. It feels like no one is listening to us. She can come on rounds and tell us how “extremely rare” these complications are that we see every day. We’ve seen kids and teens die from this, and we can prevent it. We need to be cautious to ensure that kids can avoid infection until they are eligible for vaccination. In-person school can be safe, yes, but don’t pretend that kids aren’t vulnerable."
2021-06-23 00:26:48,"I already posted my response about Emily Oster and I am standing by my villian comment. Since I am a 46 year old teacher with about 25 years experience I need to talk about some issues regarding teaching. 

It is an extremely stressful job most of the time. The stress is only slightly connected to children or teaching though. There is a great deal of churn in education. Someone commented that most teachers are under 40. I quickly googled the statistic. It was 42.4 for the US as whole. By region? Who knows. Most veteran teachers are getting really old. New teachers use to quit within 5 years. That statistic is probably much worse now. 

My point is that sure school might have been safe for younger students, but it would not have been safe for most of the teachers, especially in places that chose political allegiance to Trump over the safety and the respect of educators.

As far as unions protecting teachers - that isn't true. Our work environments are awful. Our pay and benefits are costantly attacked. Teachers are expected to serve roles that would have been ludicrous 50 years ago. People pushing for private schools really want to reduce salaries and benefits to the point a manager at McDonalds earns more. They aren't interested in children or teaching, but profit.

Those pushing to reopen schools triggered plenty of warnings about what their motivation was. Is the data accurate is less important than why they were pushing certain conclusions. Including Emily Oster."

Our town did surveillance testing from the start of the year and there was no proof covid spread in schools but teacher kept pushing for kids being home. This push was a dramatic hit to the mental health of our children.

I applaud Emily for working to keep RI students in school. It was the right thing to do. Anyone criticizing her knows full well that children were pawns in this and were the ones who took the brunt of the political game. Parents should remember who made poor decision this year and vote them out of office.

Emily was one person who showed she had the guts to state the truth and used her background knowledge to do so. Thank you for standing up for concerned parents. Maybe she can take on Critical Race Theory next."
2021-06-23 01:07:05,"The staff at the K-4 school I have taught in during the last 18 months is lower middle-class, mostly urban with over 40% of its students on the federally funded 'Free-or-Reduced' lunch program. 

In Tennessee, less than 40% have chosen to receive one of the emergency approved experimental Covid vaccines; in rural areas the same percentage is less than 30%. Some educators in our district chose to be vaccinated, and continue teaching-in person, or partially remote. 

Overwhelmingly, the colleagues I worked with expressed a deep sense of purpose for protecting our students from what we saw as a greater long-term health hazard for young children: The psychological scars from being denied to play, learn and grow with their peers. We took commonsense precautions, wore masks and did temperature checks of all incoming children each morning, and we limited size of classes as well as some distancing. Some staff members prudently increased their daily nutritional supplementation of Vitamin C, D, E as well as added fish oil and historically vetted herbal remedies.

Our district used as many common sense cleaning procedures as possible, and used compassionate monitoring of our health, emotionally and physically.

Overall, our students fared well, and now we are teaching summer school to help those who tested as lagging grade level standards.

From this perspective, our data and experience would tend to support Dr. Oster's 'un-scientific' data aggregation and her cross-fields analysis."
2021-06-23 01:08:32,"The readers who think Emily blindly suggested the reopening of schools without consideration for how to make them safer are clearly not readers of Emily’s writing. 

Back on November 16, 2020, Emily included this assessment in her newsletter:

“Prioritizing schools would also mean providing more resources to open safely. The main way we can help schools is by controlling community spread. But making teachers and others feel safe at school is also key. This means requiring masks, yes, but also providing good PPE and, ideally, improving ventilation. It means better testing and screening — both symptomatic and asymptomatic — and money for substitutes. Financial woes have always been a part of the landscape of public schools in America, partly because this isn’t the first time we failed to prioritize them. This has made it worse.”

Emily is not the enemy."
2021-06-23 01:36:15,The main problem I had was that Oster’s articles were published in so many places as if her views on the schools were more important than anyone else’s.  And she doesn’t even have a connection to public schools.
2021-06-23 01:44:31,"Oster does a great job distilling complex research findings into straightforward take-aways. Sometimes this is great. The problem is there’s a reason most researchers don’t do that—it’s because all the annoying details and caveats do matter. Oster glosses over data limitations (little evidence of COVID spreading at school because we don’t really test or trace in a way that would let us know when that happens), and then presents results with a certainty that is not warranted given those limitations. It’s one thing to say “it’s probably fine” to drink a glass of wine when pregnant. It’s another to say “it’s probably fine” to send your kid to school, which turns in to “it’s probably fine” to open schools when there’s an ongoing pandemic."
2021-06-23 01:27:27,"The staff at the K-4 school I have taught in during the last 18 months is lower middle-class, mostly urban with over 40% of its students on the federally funded 'Free-or-Reduced' lunch program.

2021-06-23 02:07:55,"The problem I had with the open schools movement is that it was never about the kids. Oh we tried to pretend it was, talking about disadvantaged communities falling further behind, but at the end of the day this was a first world problem for first world parents."
2021-06-23 01:54:31,"Given that the underfunded big city schools most likely to be crowded with poor ventilation remained closed during the height of the pandemic, how is anyone take this person seriously?

She has no data about spread of covid in crowded, poorly ventilated public schools in big urban populations because those weren't opened.   

Why doesn't she make the same sweeping conclusions about all Ivy League universities being fully opened with professors required to give in-person classes and conduct regular office hours?   Or does she actually require data when she makes pronouncements about something that will impact her own privileged life?"
2021-06-23 03:01:57,"Knowledge on Covid evolved, and is still evolving.  It was not unreasonable to exercise caution on congregation of children in schools, given past experience with, for example, polio virus.

I would also like to hear a virologist's assessment of the possibility of a Covid mutation finding a footing in a pool of unvaccinated children  in a group setting.

We already underpay and ask too much of teachers -- they are expected to be instructors, be child and family therapists, fill the supply closet, coach sports, be travel guides for field trips, detect child abuse and be safety officers for everything from playground injuries to school shooters. I respect that they did not want to be medical  experiment  subjects."
2021-06-23 03:02:01,"While I have appreciated Emily's data driven approach over the years to helping parents balance risks, all of the data in this pandemic seems to be worthless for driving future decisions as the arrival of new variants, like delta, changes the calculus.  What was happening in schools this past year will be of zero value in predicting what will happen in the fall when kids under 12 return unvaccinated and probably without masks with the delta variant swarming. I respect parents who still want to send their children to school this fall knowing these risks. Parents have a right to decide what risks are acceptable for their children, and now that teachers are vaccinated, society has provided the best protection we can for them to do their jobs safely. However, for those of us parents who do not accept the risks of sending our unvaccinated children to school with unmasked classmates, we will most likely be shut out of remote learning in the fall because Ms. Oster and others of her ilk have deemed schools as ""safe"" for kids. I don't care how low the risk is for my kids. It will be lower once they're vaccinated and then I'll send them back. I  send them to school with a flu shot; why should I be forced to send them without a covid vaccine?"
2021-06-23 02:41:07,"As a parent and healthcare worker, I am so grateful for her newsletter and her advocacy. When people say “stay in your lane” that often means “I’m jealous of your success.” I hear a lot of criticism around economic status too: “She doesn’t get it. She’s rich and sends her kids to private school.” But who cares about kids more? People who try to pretend a couple hours on Zoom every day is an education for a six-year-old? Or people who try to operate schools safely given the available evidence? I’m with Emily on this one…"
2021-06-23 03:37:42,"I don’t care if you’re an epidemiologist, economist, statistician, data scientist, or circus clown. If you can analyze data and help Americans assess risk you are sorely needed. The C.D.C. has hundreds of people assigned this task and their message is consistently incoherent and past-due. Individuals who can contribute to the national discussion are valuable."
2021-06-23 03:30:49,"A lot of comments here mentions the lack of data and have a “how can we know for sure” attitude. Well look at what happened in Europe where the schools reopened last year. They did not experience massive children mortality nor a lot of cases among children. Moving to the US I was surprised by the paranoia around COVID. Cautious is important but, let’s also look at what happened in other countries and adjust if needed."
2021-06-23 03:55:43,"Thank you Professor Oster for continuing to speak out. I wish we have someone like you bringing evidence to the discussion in Indonesia. Instead, policies (and lack thereof) is based on politician's personal preferences - lacking data, research, analysis."
2021-06-23 04:35:22,"Another arrogant academician who should just stick to what she got her PhD in. 

It certainly isn't virology & epidemiology."
2021-06-23 05:00:16,"So at what point did Dr. Oster and the “covid doesn’t harm kids” crew stop collecting data? Because delta is wreaking havoc on pediatric populations around the world, and as more data has emerged, there is actually evidence to suggest that opening schools drove community transmission. But sure, let’s continue to push through incredibly foolish ideas like no
masks next year before the youngest kids are vaccinated. We clearly know better than other parts of the world and are somehow immune from the effects of delta and whatever variant comes next."
2021-06-23 11:31:23,"The amount of quant skills doctors have is fairly low, on average calc and stats at the freshman level. That's why epidemiology exists as a separate field. But epidemiologists have no particular advantage when it comes to modeling outbreaks or analyzing real time data over a well-trained economist and have plenty of expert biases like every other field. Several people I know with backgrounds in stats, math and CS built simple models that did better than the majority of published models that were featured in the NY Times. It would generally be better if the public were more educated about what skills actually matter in particular situations. The two extreme views are ""all experts are wrong"" which you tend to see in the Trump wing and extreme credentialism, which you see among readers of this paper. Data science and being good at making predictions based on real time data belongs to no single academic field and plenty of people can read the virology papers and learn what they need. Oster shows this and has been right much more than not on covid. The only thing I think she's actually been biased on is actually breastfeeding. Having cross over expertise is valuable to society and often provides a check on the groupthink that seems to develop within highly specialized single disciplines, resulting in the solidification of expert bias."
2021-06-23 07:50:35,"Here in NZ we have been very lucky not to have suffered the huge losses of other countries, due to wonderful leadership, and our geographical isolation as well as our size. 
However one of our biggest clusters came from a school and took a long time to contain, and the other started by a cruise ship. And people died. 
This woman is an economist, so her opinion is no surprise to me. Money focused people always seem ready to tolerate some collateral damage if it helps their bottom line. I have also been saddened by the arguments for school opening because they almost never mention or show any concern for we teachers. More collateral damage I guess."
2021-06-23 10:09:09,"I think her role in this speaks for itself. She is an economist and any claims made on medicine, vaccines and epidemiology would be outside her field."
2021-06-23 11:36:11,"Oster's claims defy both logic and experience, and are driven not by data, but by the absence of data. 

Any person who's ever had a child in daycare or school knows that they pick up bugs from each other, and then bring them home to infect their families.  How would COVID possibly be any different? 

Rather than take a logical approach, fantasists like Oster posit that since we don't yet have data showing how transmissible this brand new disease is among children, we should assume that there's data that proves that it isn't transmissible.  So sure, let's use our children as guinea pigs and assume that - anylike any other disease - they're immune!  

Oh, and that new data showing brain shrinkage among survivors of mild COVID cases?  Just ignore that. They haven't studied that in children yet, so let's just assume it isn't a problem for them."
2021-06-23 08:51:35,"I still don’t know why the priority 18mths ago wasn’t to move as fast as possible towards testing everyone at least once a week.

Once the logistics for that had been set up it would’ve stopped the virus dead plus avoided all the lockdowns because only people (and close contacts) testing positive would have needed isolating.

Why isn’t this (surely the most obvious option even now) even being discussed let alone implemented?!"

2021-06-23 12:16:35,"I taught at a suburban public high school in person all year with a remarkably low number of documented cases. However the precautions were formidable.  Half the kids in at any time, significant distancing in the classroom, plexiglass sheilds at all cafeteria spaces but most importantly in my opinion was CONSTANT MASKING.   After we started getting vaccinated in March kids came all in but still with MASKS.   The main outbreak that happened in the student population was due to sports in early November."

2021-06-23 12:56:23,"Is it possible that the problem is not at all with Oster and her work?  There seems to be a contingent of people who feel school is absolutely essential for the vast majority of kids' physical, mental and developmental health, and another who feel it's not a tragedy for kids to basically miss out on a year of school (the people who say that kids' basic resilience will get them through).  Emily Oster openly acknowledged her own feelings that kids should be in school, but does that influence her interpretation of the data?  I didn't think it did.  She is not the problem here."
2021-06-23 15:07:12,"We are discovering more and more long term consequences of COVID infection, most recently, permanent brain damage.

One child falling ill from this increasingly nasty virus is one case too many."
2021-06-23 15:36:27,"The lack of interdisciplinary dialogue is arguably one of the biggest flaws in the American virus response.

Opinions about Oster specifically aside, the criticism of anyone who is not a medical expert not ""staying in their lane"" is troubling for that reason.

This is perfectly exemplified by, ""We’ve been told to do neither, but that isn’t a choice."" Oster speaks to a very white, affluent demographic, but the onslaught of unusable CDC advice was felt by all parents, especially essential workers - who are disproportionately women, lower-income, and people of color. (The reality is there were far more Starbucks baristas, janitorial staff, and Amazon Prime delivery bikers who had to go to work and didn't have the option of keeping their kids home than doctors or EMTs.)

Healthcare guidance is only useful if people take it. You need people with other areas of expertise - economists, sociologists, city planners, community organizers, even religious leaders - to weigh in on what people will actually DO.

Concerns about Oster as an ""influencer"" are warranted; no single figure like this should be any parent's sole consult. But I would actually suggest Oster's outsize influence is less the fault of Oster herself than of the medical community, for refusing and failing to be in conversation with people like her and incorporate these realities in their recommendations."
2021-06-23 16:01:25,"I'm of the err on the side of caution school, and would not seek to defend Dr Oster, but the extremes on both sides of pandemic education policy were wrong, and too much screaming on either end of the spectrum did no good.  There has to be some allowances for data that others weren't collecting--where was our DOE during the Trump debacle? cowering under lies--so if she presented data-driven advice, it's up to others who don't have the data to disprove her results."

This is force majeure, a real world plague.

The data on transmission to/from kids is beyond the point: if teachers FEEL unsafe, they shouldn’t be forced to work. End of story.

No one forces a parent to have or raise a child. When you decide to do so, you do it with the knowledge that the child’s well-being is ultimately up to you abs you alone. So when an unexpected worldwide disaster happens, it’s time to put on your big boy pants and parent your child. Yourself."

All ""data-based"" research is not equal, as the science reporters at this newspaper understand but the other reporters do not.  

This article is typical of non-science reporting, where criticism of shoddy data amplified by self-promoting researchers is presented as coming from ""union teachers"" when the criticism is actually coming from epidemiologists and scientists who actually understand that promoting ""conclusions"" without full data is plain wrong.  It is wrong even when the researcher benefits from self-promotion or when her conclusions please people in power.

This same thing happened when Oster wrote her lavishly promoted dissertation whose critics were dismissed -- until it turned out that they were right.  Oster used very limited data to promote a thesis that got her a lot of attention, implying a certainty that was absolutely unwarranted given the very limited data she had collected.  She was wrong.  But she seemed to miss the real lessons of that fiasco that would have ended a less privileged researcher's career.

Trump made mask wearing a political act, and made super-spreader events Maga-shique, after telling Woodward in secret, that the virus was real, 5 times deadlier than the flu, airborne, and affects children.

The available evidence tells me that Trump purposefully let this pandemic spin out of control, so he could create chaos and call himself a ""war president,"" with ""powers most people don't even know about,"" to help him with his Insurrection that he was planning on TV for his entire presidency. (Trump knew if he left the White House his crimes would be prosecuted, so never leaving was the plan.)

Trump and his supporters let 600,000 Americans die by refusing to coordinate a national response to a national emergency. They were fulfilling a campaign pledge from their 2010 debates. When the moderator asked what the government should do for a young man who neglected to buy insurance, but would die without healthcare, someone yelled out,

""LET HIM DIE,"" 

so the audience full of connected Republicans applauded and cheered!

Republicans spent 4 years cheering Trump's calls for violence without due process against critics and journalists and in elections. Now they protect their Insurrectionist in Chief.

Yes, it’s time for a commission to investigate the horrendous response to this ugly episode in American history. With 600,000 dead, we owe it to their memories and to their families. If we walk away from this without accountability, then we are no better than any other Fascist regime."

Americans were so divided by tribalism, so distrustful of government, so divorced from reality (and incapable of understanding basic knowledge), and so badly led that they were largely incapable of acting for the collective good. Elements of this sickness have been evident for some time. The US failure on C19 was analogous to the US' utter failure to control its epidemic of gun violence - and for many of the same reasons. Americans normalized for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (rather than just tens of thousands annually) because too many put their personal convenience and beliefs over the welfare of others. Being intensely selfish is an American right. Add to this conspiracy theories, right wing media, poor education and racism, and the non-response to C19 becomes an indictment of the entire culture.  Donald Trump, as responsible as he is for this catastrophe, was also only a symptom. When his incompetence became clear, why didn't his own party act to control him? Here in Canada, we did much better than the US but still faced the stupidity of right wing provinces putting economics ahead of people. They invariably paid the price in deaths."
2021-06-16 11:19:11,The only purpose of a commission is to find someone to blame. For the Democrats it’s always Trump. Bipartisan and non-partisan are a joke in the hostile environment the Democrats have created.
2021-06-16 12:07:53,"A commission appointed by the Federal government to investigate the performance of the Feds is bound to be a failure. The 9/11 commission produced a report that was not complete because the Federal government denied them access to many records, especially where the Saudis were concerned, which has led to much skepticism about the conclusions. I suspect a COVID commission would suffer the same fate, especially with respect to funding for GOF research, and if a commission were to be established it should include a wide variety of people and should not be led by Mr. Zelikow or anybody associated with 9/11."
2021-06-16 12:09:29,"How many new viral outbreaks will lead to epidemics and even pandemics of their own by the time the commission issues its final report?  The Biden administration must work on identifying and containg outbreaks now, with the help of our allies and the World Health Organization, and not bother waiting for a commission.  Just like keeping our borders safe from a military invasion, this is a task that cannot wait or end."
2021-06-16 11:53:28,"Yes, yes, yes. Let's have a bipartisan commission to thoroughly uncover the way our country handled this once in a century pandemic. As a health professional, I hope it recognizes the extreme burdens faced by everyone in healthcare as they fought to do their jobs with grossly inadequate protection. It was horrific and inexcusable. Nurses wearing garbage bags! Only by identifying the faults can we do better."
2021-06-16 11:56:33,If it weren’t for the fact that the virus leaked out of a lab and a ravaged a city shrouded in secrecy (they claimed an insulting 3000 deaths after erecting 10 new hospitals) and then stonewalled information about asymptotically airborne spread and delayed stonewalling by the WHO perhaps things would be better for the planet.

You can’t have 600,000 people die and just throw your hands up in the air and say “Oh well!”  Important questions have yet to be answered, among them what was the actual origin of the virus.  After that, how can the federal government better prepared for future pandemics?  How do we combat the growing politicized movement against science in this country that led to so many deaths?  Should there be a cabinet-level member of future administrations charged with addressing the issue of future pandemics?"
2021-06-16 12:02:23,"The response to the Covid virus was horrendous and a failure at nearly every level……except one.  

It was a perfect execution of the Shock Doctrine.  While the great majority suffered the richest 10% made out like bandits.  Trillion$ were directed to the ownership class via both fiscal and monetary policy.  It is still going on and has resulted in the most profound inequality this country has ever seen.  We may be just one recession away from seeing this volcano erupt."
2021-06-16 11:35:18,"I'm all for a nonpartisan investigation.    Having both USA and Japanese citizenship,  I don't think either nation has dealt with the Covid crisis well.   As many objective facts without an agenda would be most helpful. This is why I recently became an Independent after having been a Democrat.   At the moment, I'm deeply embarrassed by the US crime rate, China's lack of transparency, and Japan's handling of the Olympics.   Sad to say but sometimes I do wish I weren't Asian or American at this time."
2021-06-16 11:51:30,"An investigation funded by a select few wealthy individuals through their sham ""foundations"" will come up with whatever result they pay for.
Charles Koch and his late brother David have inflicted lasting damage by distorting America democracy to bolster their own fortunes.  These same billionaires and their corporations are also funding ALEC and statehouse Republican effort to suppress voting. They are the shadow government they used to warn us about.
The January 6th Insurrection continues by other means and on many fronts"
2021-06-16 11:45:13,"There needs to be a commission and it must do a better job than its 9/11 predecessor.

Some basic questions about our poor response to the epidemic need to be answered.

Why didn't we have adequate supplies of PPE?
Why was there no national strategy for what was obviously a national problem?
Did our federal agencies fund gain of function research on Covid or not?
Did they provide any funding that was used in the Wuhan lab?

Why didn't the CDC or the NIH issue treatment guidelines for clinicians? Even to this day, doctors have no treatment guidelines for non-hospital Covid patients.

Did we really follow the science on lockdowns? Current data shows little or no difference in virus spread between jurisdictions that did lockdown and those that pursued more limited forms of containment.

The answer to this question is critical for the future.

Finally, we need to know why we failed in certain very basic areas, such as following international protocols on information sharing?

And why we failed to follow normal procedures for utilizing repurposed drugs as a treatment option?

We cant claim the science didn't support their use. The whole idea of repurposed drugs is that they are useful beyond what they were originally designed to do.

And explain why chronic deceases that have not been adequately treated in minority communities led to 2.5 times the fatality rate for those communities?

Why haven't they been adequately treated? Why did we leave those communities at higher risk?"
2021-06-16 12:36:11,"Until we understand that the pandemic as a public health crisis, one in which our individual actions effect the health of the nation,-until we learn that lack of care for others actually puts ourselves at greater risk, we will continue to fail in these kind of situations. 

As our planet ails due to climate change this is not likely to be the only challenge we have to face.  Looking out for number has some benefits, but resolving a pandemic requires more than that."
2021-06-16 12:17:03,"I am beyond outraged that the Times would give any credibility to Zelikow.

Zelikow displayed a total lack of integrity when he led the 9/11 Commission on its whitewash job after he had coauthored a book with Condoleezza Rice.

Bush2 and Rice completely ignored warnings about bin Laden yet they were absolved of responsibility by the 9/12 Commission.

Koch is another ideologue who cannot be trusted and any commission backed by Koch and run by Zelikow is the last thing we need if we are searching for the truth.

Richard Clarke, the only person in the Bush administration to apologize for the national security failure of 9/11, should head the pandemic commission.

This nation has been seriously damaged by misinformation from Republican operatives and we must know the truth about the realities of this world if we are to save our democracy."
2021-06-16 12:32:42,"""I’d like to see recommendations to prevent it from happening in the future.""

""Could intelligence officials have worked more closely with epidemiologists to track the virus as it took hold, and do the same with future emerging infections?""

Yes, and in fact before the Trump administration removed pandemic response team from the National Security Council and cut the CDC early warning office in China, they were working more closely, and would have alerted the world to the first cases in China and pushed (a competent President and the attempt to silence news -eg the recanting of the brave doctor Li Wenliang--Chinese) into protective action."

2021-06-16 12:37:15,"Strangely enough I am privy to information not in the public domain, so my comment can not be as open as it will be in about a month.

Certainly the CIA knew there was a problem in the fall of 2019; and within StratCom Hq it is known SARS-CoV-2 is a bio WMD, which accidentally escaped.

We know everyone in the Russian Asset's administration with authority to spend Gov moneymaking had a past that was a prologue of grifting.   The FDA has a long history of being in the pocket of big pharma. And there are FDA and CDC members with untenable conflicts, .

Further, the tweaked 20th C. antibody vaccine platforms are known to not be efficacious in the long term, yet Gov authorized to fund new bio science platforms have not funded an approach to defeat this particular virus that employs a 21st C. bio science killer T-cell immunology platform.

So there are different levels to investigate, and conflicts among members of the CDC and FDA should also be on the table.  

Retrospectively, it will be clear it was beyond reckless to advise ""masks off"" to offer a carrot to elicit vaccinations. This carrot has created a national spreading event due to the plethora of naive public enthusiasm for resuming life without masks .

""Bi-partisan"" is an archaic concept buried in the dark shadows cast by Traitor Mitch and his band of henchmen still in complicit support of Putin's Puppet in lockstep opposition to restoring or improving the public good.

2021-06-16 11:48:22,"All fine and good to see what could have been done better to prevent the excessive damage and unnecessary deaths from a future pandemic.

START WITH TRUMP and his gross, criminally negligent and ignorant mishandling of the situation and then move on to vaccine development and deployment. There MUST be a constantly-updated manual for vaccine development and effective Federal Government control of such a NATIONAL problem.

It is quite obvious that the Trump administration was woefully uninvolved and lethally avoided necessary guidance - not that they would have known what they were doing anyway. States should not have to individually invent coping strategies on the fly as they did. Millions were infected unnecessarily and tens of thousands DIED unnecessarily. NEVER AGAIN."
2021-06-16 12:35:03,A chart that appeared in the Times a few weeks ago showed that every year from 1910 to 2000 had higher overall mortality rate than 2020.
2021-06-16 11:52:00,"The proponents of this commission admit ""... it might be handicapped without subpoena power and access to documents."" Handicapped is an understatement. Trump and his cabal will never voluntarily provide information that could implicate themselves. Rather, they will waste time and cause endless delay.

The solution to this problem is the same solution that gets infrastructure rolling, better health care, voting rights and mitigation of Climate Change. Get rid of the filibuster. If they don't end the filibuster, by the time the 2022 election rolls around, Republicans will have hijacked the election, guaranteeing their return to power.

2021-06-16 13:13:38,"Whether or not this came through a lab, our lack of preparedness, speed and focus of our response, and the politicization of every part of covid impaired our conversation and our response at every level. How we responded is a size 10 problem. 

Whether it came through a lab, is a size 4 because we have a moment to ramp up. Going through a lab, at this point, would impact the speed of infection. But, how we can monitor research and health in nations like China has to be a consideration. We also need to know what capabilities we had that weren’t developed or deployed."
2021-06-16 11:51:14,"This COVID commission is a great idea, except that Trump will oppose it, because it would inevitably place most of the blame on Trump himself.  And if Trump is against it, McConnell and McCarthy will block it.
The only way out of this impasse is for Trump to be prosecuted and convicted for any number of major crimes, so that the anti-Trumpers in the GOP can build a new GOP without Trump.
After that, many things will become possible."

After all, our future may depend upon that!!"
2021-06-16 14:12:26,"The politicization of the pandemic was beyond belief.  The fact that the right wing and the former president through their example, tried to downplay the COVID and actively sought to stop people from wearing masks and social distancing  cost us hundreds of thousands of lives and gave the USA one of the highest death rates in the world.

We all saw it in real time.  We saw the former president mock people who wore masks, hold rallies and claim he wasn't ""responsible"" - he actually said that!!  At the same time the right wing stood by and supported him as opposed the American people.  In coordination the right wing media lied and lied all while people died.

What a disgrace - a great American failure - the whole world was watching and they still are."
2021-06-16 13:05:46,"Bipartisan. Ha! Good luck with that. If it’s truth about the pandemic such an investigation hopes to yield then leave the Republicans out of it. Anything they’re part of is, right off the bat, suspect and tainted."
2021-06-16 13:58:07,"For all Trump's crimes, and they are many, the real culprit in this is our own childish selfishness and impatience. 

I mean, who in their right mind would think it's more important to open a business than to save a life!?! Yet many of us accepted — and continue to accept — this lie.

The idea that we had to make a choice, between our health and safety and ""the economy,"" is a fiction that was as successful as it was largely  because of the groundwork laid over decades of neoliberal economic ideology that tells us it's more important to protect the wealth and privilege of a few hundred billionaires than it is to provide living wages and affordable housing and healthcare to hundreds of millions of working families."
2021-06-16 13:21:04,Trump would never allow that.  It would take attention away from distractions such as whether this natural virus escaped from a lab - and focus on how his incompetent leadership ended up giving us rates of infection and death (per million people) that are twice as high as those in Germany (a country with more than twice the population density of US).
2021-06-16 13:08:34,"The overarching cause of this pandemic (and the next) is a state of being unprepared, of being disunited, and of lacking the political will in party leaders and other elected representatives to speak and to act in the public's best interest.

Now, can you ever have the top leader running amok?  No.  Donald J. Trump lacked the cognitive skills to distill his questions internally and to reach/re-assess the way forward on a basis of logic.  Primary in his fatal flaw is his overwhelmingly need to be praised DAILY as the ram rod of the operation, so he grandstanded his cluelessness before a consternated world.

And today, political will -- still bends -- to the whims of the reality-challenged showman.  How can we move forward on meeting this challenge (and the next) with Trump gunk still in the gears?

An independent investigation?  Trump Puppets will never agree and anyone who does will be primaried. The Puppets are loyal to their path to power.  To attain it, they accept the consequences of future mindless grandstanding -- WHATEVER THE COST to The People.

His enablers should be voted out on the basis of what the Free Press reported in real time.  But, keep trying for investigation and support the Free Press's efforts to dispassionately review the events."
2021-06-16 13:12:11,"I’m all for a non partisan investigation as long as it also includes investigating why the U.S. had the highest infection and death rates, and our failed response to the worst pandemic in over 100 years."
2021-06-16 12:45:46,"A nonpartisan COVID-19 Commission will never happen.  It will suffer exactly the same fate as the nonpartisan, 9/11-style Commission on the January 6 insurrection.  Trump and his Republican enablers blocked the Jan. 6 commission and they'll do the same to a COVID-19 commission.  They bare significant responsibility for both of these catastrophes and exposing their complicity would hurt them in the 2022 midterm elections.

Republicans only care about power, not small-d democracy.  Truth won't advance that agenda and so they'll block it at all costs.  If we get either commission, it will be a result of Democrats in the House and almost half of the country will ignore the results because the Republicans will tell them that it's fake news.

The House should go ahead with both commissions since the truth is still important.  But the hyper-partisan atmosphere created by Trump and his Republican acolytes will make the results far less effective."
2021-06-16 13:50:56,Wasn't this a bipartisan pandemic meaning there is a bipartisan fog aided by the mainstream media's total failure to source and report facts. We have two parties controlling our government and society while fencing off diverse opinions and the experience of numerous nations. We don't need another commission to 'fix' blame. We need an effort to fix a failing system.
2021-06-16 12:50:06,"An investigation on the virus is a distraction technique to make sure we stop paying attention to the assault on our democracy and voting rights.

2021-06-16 14:09:02,"I have to think that one of the things  an independent commission would discover is the lack of an adequate public health system.

If we had such a system we would have had a more coordinated response.  As it was, we had some hospitals overloaded with patents, and others with no patients.

Also we had a terrible lack of PPE and no coordination in acquiring it.  Instead, we had hospitals competing for PPE.

And, if we have another pandemic please keep the politicians out of the way.  We need the experts to run our response."
2021-06-16 14:34:33,"Something I have wondered about and not seen explained is why we had 50 plus approaches to the pandemic (i.e., 50 states plus territories) rather than a centralized approach.  In other words, we seemed to have taken a ""states rights"" approach to a national crisis.  Of course a centralized approach would not have worked well in a Trump Administration.  Still, those countries that handled the pandemic best took a centralized, ""we're all in this together,"" rather than an individualized approach."
2021-06-16 14:07:59,I seem to recall that such a thought was voiced last year to investigate & that remarks were made that is could have escaped from a Chinese lab...and it was laughed at & shrugged off by the same people calling for the same today.

2021-06-16 14:41:24,I am hoping this includes both parties. The fact that Pelosi and Neal's structured the Coronavirus package to move 4 trillion to Wall Street while seeing out advice from Bob Rubin on all this indicates they were more worried about stock portfolios than lives of people. It wasn't just the Trump Administration.
2021-06-16 14:54:17,I would like to see the  Origins determined once and for all and an acknowledgment from any party/parties that are found to be responsible and discussion about reparations made .  I would also like to see the variance cease to be referred to by their geographical location unless we determine that we will call the original virus by its geographical location once that is finalized. Aka no more ‘ delta variant ’ Etc. How is that possibly fair? Where are the Cries of racism when it’s called the Delta variant?
2021-06-16 14:56:30,"Keep the politicians and anyone with a motive or need to generate sensationalism from this as far away as possible. A sober, in depth, well informed behind the scenes review and analysis are what’s called for."
2021-06-16 15:00:01,"So there are two investigative commissions we ought to have.  One which should investigate what happened and what led to the events of January 6, 2021 and one on how the pandemic was handled by the Trump and Biden administrations.  Sorry, but the Trump administration bears the brunt of the blame for how the pandemic was handled.  The Biden administration wasn't around when we were told that the pandemic would simply go poof.  They weren't around when we heard that the national reserve wasn't for the states, only the federal government.  They weren't around when extremists got busy plotting to kill Michigan's governor or kidnap her for putting mask mandates in place.

Nope, the responsibility for the entire fiasco lies with the GOP and Trump (and his son-in-law and senior members of the GOP).  So does what happened on January 6, 2021.  

We need to understand how to prevent another insurrection.  For COVID19 we need to understand how to better handle a situation that has serious consequences if the initial steps aren't enough to prevent things from going from bad to worse.  And we need to empower entities like the CDC when the executive branch fails us as it did this time. 

COVID was an evolving situation.  It could have gone either way.  We were lucky."

2021-06-16 15:21:23,"Honestly this looks like one of the under the dome strategies by Koch and others to push congress away from voters rights legislation and accountability on republicans.

Please write democrats and tell them not to support this.  We don't need more conspiracy theories and attacks on our society designed to disable our society from functioning.

There is nothing we can do about the virus at this point.  It is here.  Our democracy and voting rights should be front and center.  Don't let them distract us."

American is a country that has always evolved to be better, and this would be a way to learn from our failure and success."
2021-06-16 14:43:32,"Another commission. I’m sure it will have all the transparency of the 9/11 commission and produce similar results as the war on drugs. 

If you expect any government admission as to the damage caused by their response to the pandemic, you’re not paying attention. This proposal is nothing more than a quest to divert attention and accountability."
2021-06-16 15:00:47,"1. It made sense to investigate 9-11, a stealth attack on the US by human enemies who did not leave calling cards.The agent of this pandemic is a virus doing what all infectious agents do: invade,   multiply, transmit. No mystery there.

2. The vastly different mortality rates from this virus, worldwide, is a natural experiment in what worked, what didn't work. The failures of our response to the pandemic are obvious had have been on front pages for more than a year: delay in recognizing the Covid 19 deaths overseas could happen to us, the failure to test, contact trace early on when the pandemic was manageable, the denial of the virus as a ""hoax,""  the distraction of blaming China, rather than preparing our medical system with PPE supplies, ICU supplies, confusing and mixed message from leaders that increased distrust in government, the AWOL CDC. 

3.Regardless of the findings of the Wuhan lab leak theory, there will be intentional biologic weapons and there more novel viruses generated simply because genetic replication is not a static process. 

4.  What is sorely needed now is to re-establish a pandemic response protocol with the already extensive knowledge accumulated from our failures the past year. The decisions on protocol should be made with public health and policy experts. Politics and finger pointing should be out of line. Implementation of this protocol is another matter, but at least our government would have a plan."
2021-06-16 15:16:48,"So many approached were tried in different places that there is plenty of data. There needs to be a careful and objective review of the facts. There will be a number of ""lessons (hopefully) learned"" and there should be suggestions for mitigation of future pandemics. This time were were lucky. mRNA vaccines had been under development for several years and they could quickly be adapted for use against C19 and seem to work better than anyone imagined possible. 

It is also important to look at the origin of the virus. In a recent statement Shi Zhengli discounted any possibility that the virus could have come from a lab in Wuhan. As a scientist she should be open to testing a reasonable hypothesis. Lab records would show if the mutation that started infecting people in Wuhan in 2020 matches any of the variants that were under study in the lab. It is at least as plausible as the idea that it just happened to evolve in a food market just round the corner from the lab. A torn glove, a mask removed a moment too soon, or a sterilizer that didn't work properly - one time, one person is all it would take to release the virus. An honest mistake, no malintent but serious consequences. Procedures need to be improved.

The whole issue of vaccination needs to be reviewed as well. Individual liberty is important but so is public safety. The balance needs to be discussed."
2021-06-16 15:22:17,"The academic community will (and should) have the last peer-reviewed word on how the US handled the pandemic.  That community has the proven ability to muster experts from the range of disciplines that need to be involved in an objective assessment.  Reliable academic studies are fact-driven, not spin-driven, and so should not require subpoena power or access to confidential documents.  Policy-makers would benefit from an evaluation that rationally trades off between public health and economic considerations."

Findings:

1. This new virus killed and sickened many people.
2. Reputable scientists and public health experts at the state and federal level did their best with evolving information, and saved lives.
3. Some reputable scientists offered alternative views for consideration, helping with the response both by being wrong and by being right.
4. Some very disreputable “scientists” knowingly pushed false and dangerous narratives for apparently political or “religious” reasons.
5. Many political leaders and most people did the right things to protect themselves and others.
6. Some politicians and their followers did not take the virus seriously, and cost many lives.

Recommendations:

1. Throw Trump, Trump, Trump, Atlas, DeSantis, Abbott, Noemi, Ron Johnson, Marjory Taylor Greene, and that crazy Stella Immanuel in prison for making fraudulent claims that killed people.

Regarding the media's role here, this paper's presumption of guilt toward the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic and the total absence of any critique of the Biden administration, which has greatly utilized and extended the previous administration's work, indicates there's a lot more manipulation in store for us. Besides the headlines and pictures (that they change for maximum effect), the first and last few paragraphs clearly show what they want us to take from all this.

Much has been made of your email to Dr. Fauci in late January 2020, shortly after the coronavirus genome was first sequenced. You said, “The unusual features of the virus [](potentially) look engineered.”

Can you explain what you meant?

At the time, based on limited data and preliminary analyses, we observed features that appeared to potentially be unique to SARS-CoV-2.

Some people, including virologist David Baltimore, say the presence of the furin cleavage site could be a sign of human manipulation of the virus, whereas you and other virologists have said it naturally evolved. 

Can you explain for readers why you don’t think it is proof of an engineered virus?

Furin cleavage sites are found all across the coronavirus family, including in the betacoronavirus genus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to. [] people are pointing to two “CGG” sequences that code for the amino acid arginine in the furin cleavage site as strong evidence that the virus was made in the lab. Such statements are factually incorrect.

[] These findings, [] strongly suggest that it evolved naturally and there is very little chance somebody engineered it.

Based on detailed analyses of the virus conducted to date by researchers around the world, it is extremely unlikely that the virus was engineered. []"

I love Dr Kathleen Weber's mask=seatbelt, vaccine=airbag analogy! I'm stealing that to use myself. :)"
2021-06-29 18:59:50,"It would be most helpful, if  some media would inform us of the countries where the home tests are acceptable. I have been searching for days, and can't find this information. 
You mention travel, but  little more."
2021-06-29 19:35:26,"They’re great for everyday piece of mind. In the UK, we can order a box of 7 rapid lateral flow tests for free via post, or you can pick them up free at a local pharmacy. I usually take a test every 2-3 days."
2021-06-29 20:49:13,"The rapid molecular  is much more reliable than the.antigen  test and almost as good as thePCR.  The molecular test should, therefore, be made available at a lower price. Regardless of what the article says about not to be dissuaded by the antigen reliability statistics , its ability to accurately detect covid  is far less than optimum. If I thought it was essential to not be with someone who has covid, I  wouldnt take the risk using this test. I think we as a nation should ,for all health care , but particularly for this killer disease prioritize our resources so that the masses of citizens can have the best safety measures available."
2021-06-29 23:00:55,Thank you for this information- clearly written and informative.  It was helpful to read the scenarios on how to use these tests in future social situations.  Well done!!
2021-06-29 16:55:12,"The people most likely to spread this virus to you are not going to be the folks using home testing.

The same people that buy and use these tests are going to be using good judgement in risky situations anyway.

Amusing that by far most of the quotes from a healthcare professional are from the one that is acknowledged to be a consultant to one of the products performing this service.

No wonder the author could get a lot of material for this piece from him...."
2021-06-30 03:18:51,"So you let someone consulting for an at home testing company use the NYT as an advertisement?  What the heck has happened to the NYT.  It has never been, nor will it ever be, a good idea to test people who are not feeling sick.  Asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 has been demonstrated NOT to be a driving factor in this disease.  The latest variant, Delta, has around 1/10 the case fatality rate of the alpha version, UK data shows.  People need to stop their neurosis over this disease and get back to living life, cognizant of all of its risks.  

Here's advice that should be followed, no profit involved: if you feel sick, stay home."
2021-06-30 17:08:21,"@tarapope - Terrific piece - thank you.  Although I'm confused about the accuracy of the rapid antigen tests.  You quote one study as indicating tests are 64% accurate for picking up symptomatic cases, and 36% for asymptomatic.  Later you say these tests can reduce risk of asymptomatic spread by 90%+.  I don't follow.  Help!"
2021-06-30 13:58:40,"*Biased* and *Misleading*!
1) Bias: As reviewer 'tanstaafl' pointed out, this article pushing rapid home Covid tests uses as its primary expert source a doctor who is a consultant for a home Covid test company. Really, New York Times???
2) Misleading: The article completely ignores the issue of false positive test results, which is a major concern with the common, less expensive home tests. As an FDA website points out, rapid tests sound good with an estimated specificity of 98%. - But - If this test is used in a population with the disease under reasonable control, with only 1% of the population having the disease, 70 of 100 positive tests would be wrong! These people would falsely be labelled as having Covid, with all of the ensuing negative effects on them, their family, their schools, and their community. At 0.1% disease prevalence - still above that of my New Jersey county - 96 of 100 positive results would be false! (All of these figures are from the FDA example.)
3) An unbiased, non-misleading article addressing the same issues would be greatly appreciated, Times. Thank you."
2021-06-30 22:15:07,"Here is my concern I had an early case of Covid in March, and was unable to get tested. In December I am pretty sure I had Covid again from the symptoms, got tested and the result was negative. This test did not test all the new strains!
These cheap tests. What good are they if they are not current strains? Are they labeled for strains?"

2021-06-30 23:09:26,"The Binax now home test is super helpful.  I used it before and after a flight and with a neighbor with cough and fever.  Yes, it is not as accurate as a PCR test though the wait times for those are much longer now that testing availability is down.  I find that people are accepting that their colds are NOT Covid right now and that is worrisome.  Patients are eager to return to camp, day care, flights, and activities despite our encouraging them to test and confirm that they are Covid negative and wait for symptoms to go away. Yes, if vaccinated, it is less likely that Covid is the cause of your cough but we should be cautious right now since so much is still unknown with regard to the new variants.  According to the Abbot Binax Now website- ""We have found that these new strains are primarily characterized by a distinct set of mutations in the virus’ spike protein. Abbott’s diagnostic tests that detect the presence of COVID-19, including our molecular and antigen tests, do not rely on the spike protein to identify the virus. That’s why we are confident our tests are effective at detecting COVID-19 variants."" Tests and masks really are easy ways to stay safe!"
2021-06-30 23:22:44,"People with no medical training are not as likely to follow safety protocols as medical professionals. The article states that the BinaxNOW test ""contains two rapid antigen tests per box and costs around $24."" Prediction: To save money, people will reuse the swabs and hence spread the virus from one person to another. This actually did happen in a country as reported in the New York Times, wherein Covid-19 test swabs were reused to cut costs."

I’ve been using the antigen tests since December 2020 testing myself twice a week to ensure that I don’t have Covid before I go into the office or visit a client. My children have been self testing at home since March. The UK government have sent home testing kits to every secondary age child (11 years old ) to use for free. This has enabled kids to get back to in school classes & to track infections. I’m thankful to have access to these tests so we can feel more confident & safe as we try to get back to ‘normal’"

Curious - will there be follow up from NYT on how CDC/Public Health will report positive COVID-19 cases from home testing kits?  The home tests seem quick, easy and a great solution - especially for people who are unable, still hesitant or unwilling to get vaccinated. But we still want to know if COVID is spreading right? Won’t home tests make it easier to undercount increasing infection rates? Are positive results from home tests required to be reported to local health departments?"
2021-07-01 12:54:40,Reading about how the UK distributes free tests to its people here. Why isn’t the US doing the same?
2021-07-01 14:40:06,"I appreciate the recommendations in this article but the cost of the tests remain prohibitive to many. The tests are about $25 for 2 and it would be $50 every time you wanted to test your family of four before visiting grandma in the nursing home. If you go every week that’s $200/month. This adds up very quickly. We should encourage routine use of this testing but should also provide easier, cheaper access. Additionally, we need to couple this with guidance about how to manage mild symptoms, when to stay home regardless of test result, and when to get a PCR test."

2021-07-06 06:53:40,"I agree that it is important to continue COVID-19 testing often. Although it has been a long time and we are tired of the situation and the government has already lifted the quarantine and opened shops and restaurants, that does not mean that the virus is over! People keep going out and keep getting infected and we must be aware of this at all times. I personally am fully vaccinated, as is my family, but every so often we do a test to be sure that we are not carrying the virus. Although it is rare, COVID-19 cases have already been heard in vaccinated people and we must be aware that it is a possibility and we must avoid it at all costs in order to return to normality in the near future. I highly encourage everyone that meet up with family and friends, go out to crowded places, go to events, etc. to test before attending these meetings and thus avoid contagion. It is also important to try to avoid unnecessary meetings, just as it is important to take tests every so often, it is important to avoid meeting with people if possible, not to mention how important it is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. If we want to get out of this pandemic soon we have to do our part, taking a rapid test before a large event can change everything. One person can infect many people, and those people can infect others and so it is spread successively, which can end in an outburst of COVID-19, and that is precisely what we are trying to avoid with rapid testing."

2021-07-08 06:04:06,"Dr. Michael Mina is being unfairly trashed here; more than any other researcher, his advocacy made it possible for these quick tests to be marketed. 

He has labored since the start of the pandemic to convince the FDA that tests that are quick, cheap, and available at home can help stop the pandemic much more effectively than a PCR test, the so-called gold standard, whose results are often not returned until long after a person is no longer infectious, and therefore useless in the service of identifying people while they are infectious. 

Several reader comments assume that he is biased because he consults with a new home-testing company that doesn’t yet have any products on the market. His consulting work  aims for a test that can be marketed for $1 per test, and could even be used for “pooled testing” so that the cost would be $1 for a group. 

For a good summary of a somewhat counter-intuitive topic, why a “less sensitive” test may be more useful in identifying an infectious person before they infect others, see ""Failing the Coronavirus-Testing Test""

I've never met Dr. Mina & have no financial interest in any of this. I was active in public health during the AIDS pandemic. The failures of strategy, messaging and resources in this pandemic have me tearing my hair out. 

Dr. Mina is one of the few experts who has actually been able to bring about practical change, and we should be grateful to him."
2021-07-22 20:53:53,"Now that I am fully vaccinated (and everyone in my household is, and my younger brother who is 12 and who I do not live with has his first dose), I am comfortable treating covid like the flu. I get my flu shot every year, and while it does not completely protect me, it helps give me confidence that I am unlikely to become seriously ill. 

As a bit of a germaphobe, I handle the flu by washing my hands very frequently, avoiding touching high-touch surfaces, carrying hand sanitizer for when I do not have easy access to soap and water, avoiding those with flu-like symptoms, and bringing a mask for things like prolonged air travel or any time I may find myself enclosed indoors with someone who may seem ill and I don’t have the ability to leave the situation. I also minimize my time in high density areas, and even though I am a college student, I avoid crowded bars/clubs during flu season (and most other crowded indoor gatherings as well).

There is a non zero chance we will need to live with covid for a long time. I’m currently treating it like “covid season” (and I’ll continue to do so until infection rates go way down and vaccination rates are very high), where I take extra precautions to keep myself safe, but I also engage in lower risk activities that I would do in a normal winter in order to see those I love, and have some fun/get out of the house. Those are important too :)

The country had not ordered any vaccines until very recently. My brother went up to Nairobi for a Doctor checkup and was offered the Sputnik which he declined. The city in which he lives is experiencing widespread disease with funerals increasing by the day. There is no health care resource for the citizens other than the small local hospital. This tragedy is ongoing and horrific.

There is plenty of cause for blame on the central government which has denied the threat of COVID. The former President who was the head denier died of COVID-19 around the same time my brother was ill. There is change with the new President and improvements are visible but the virus rules. 

Our next family Zoom will happen in the next couple of weeks. I’m hoping to hear good news on COVID efforts there. In the meantime, East Africa is reeling from the Pandemic with no end in sight.

I, for one, believed that we were saved in 2020 because of the lockdown, and that we should have focused much more of our budget on those impacted, and that we should have followed the same playbook this year.  However, I am sure that the people in power (and the opposition) read the fatigue and angst building up in the public, and misread the severity of the new variants, leading to these horrendous results.

The initial wave in India was mild and over the course of 2020, there was a belief that Indians are ""immune"" to Covid-19 because Indians had a supercharged immune system due to prevalence of so many diseases and pollution. Everyone let their guard down. Corrupt Covid-19 testing centers gave out negative test results for attending Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival. On top of this were the election rallies. It was a disaster waiting to happen. The Delta variant affected young people and so many people died. The actual count is probably 10 times the reported numbers. This is based on reports from relatives seeing 50 bodies at the crematorium when a city had reported 4 or 5 deaths due to Covid-19. We too are likely to face another wave in states with low vaccination. The Delta variant went from 6% of cases to 10% to now 20% of all cases - doubling every 2 weeks. This is a much more lethal strain. The Pandemic continues in the US thanks to reluctance by many to take the Covid-19 vaccines."

How is this any different than what happened in the USA under the Former Guy? Modi saw how Former Guy responded (dereliction of duty, politicizing, propagandizing)  and what happened in the USA. Did he think it could not happen in India?
Denying science and reality has and continues to result  in catastrophes. You do this at your peril.
Let's face it, most folks don't learn that they don't learn."
2021-06-23 11:18:15,"I’m not sure Covid told us anything about India, it’s leadership, and it’s societal issues that we didn’t know before the pandemic. The virus is simply exacerbating very obvious traits in an over populated, under nourished state."
2021-06-23 12:14:04,"This is criticism that Modi deserves richly, and in a true democracy, should have to answer for to his countrymen without dissembling and dishonesty. And then, let the chips where they may -- he should get get whatever censure or punishment is prescribed by Indian law. That would be the measure of India's democratic values.

But this also brings up the question, where is the American comic saying in as many words that the Trump administration ""has blood on his hands?"" The US has vastly more resources than India, a per capita income that even well-off Indians can only dream of, ""the best health care system in the world,"" and yet is high on the leader board of fatalities. The worst indictment: China has far far fewer fatalities than the US. Why is the US government response so awful in comparison?"
2021-06-23 12:30:33,"Modi's handling of COVID in India has been truly appalling, but it is interesting to compare the overall COVID death rate in India, still a developing country with relatively poor public health provision, with that of the UK. According to the Times' own data, the death rate in  in India over the period of the pandemic  is 29 per 100,000, while the UK's is 192 per 100,000. It would appear that Boris Johnson, with his willful underestimation of the lethal potential of this virus, his tardy lockdowns and his general incompetence, has been responsible for a much greater ""state orchestrated COVID massacre"" than Modi. In this respect Johnson has out-done even his populist hero Trump."
2021-06-23 13:16:37,"How can an article based on a stand-up comedian be taken serious?  To make the matter more dramatic, the article has a video of cremation of many dead people at the same time which the common custom in India. Yes, it is true that India faced a sudden resurgence of a new variant which was more infectious and deadly than the previous ones. As a result, India faced shortages of essential supplies such as oxygen. This surge happened as a result of the religious festivals and election rallies in which all political parties and politicians participated. So, the blame doesn't belong only to Modi. But, after the initial difficulties, India overcame the hardship and was able to contain the virus. Yes, it is true that many died, but the count is a lot less than in USA. In the third wave in America, more than 200000 perished in America. If there was no vaccination, much more would have perished. So, the heading - the state orchestrated covid massacre - is not based on realty."
2021-06-23 11:47:12,"There should be an honest review of the performance of all nations during this pandemic, and every flaw should be attributed to a number of death, that could have been avoided.
India is not the only nation, that made big mistakes. And how many people have died because of misinformation ?
The death toll in the USA per capita is twice as high as in the country i am living in (germany). That are 300.000 american lives, that could have been saved. And i attribute these needlessly lost 300.000 lives to one person and some right wing media hosts.
We can not bring back these lives, we can not even sue these people for slaughter. But at least we can and we should shame them for eternity in our history books."

Clearly only a comedian can come with such a comparison and get away with a post in the NyT. Why hasn’t the NyT run anything close to such accusations with Donald Trump, when 400,000 lives were lost in the span of 6 months. When India, a country of 1.3 billion had 14-day average of only 11,000 cases in February 2021, naturally any leader would think the pandemic has receded. Vaccinations started rolling out in January 2021 itself. So you cannot accuse the government of not trying to protect its people. This piece is morbid, unfair and overhyped."

It is understandable that an occasionally funny (mildly, at that) stand-up comedian uses the word for dramatic effect.

Both events were super spreaders. Modi bragged that at his Rally all he could see were people. He basked in the glory, sort of like his hero Trump. He also gave away millions of vaccines claiming India (i.e. HE) had defeated Covid. Yes, Modi is to blame for 50% of the deaths due to his narcissistic behavior."
2021-06-23 11:15:26,"Modi shut down India too quickly in 2020. He opened it up too soon in 2021. He should have used the perfect foresight he has and complete power he commands, to wave his hand and get the timing just right.

His intentions were good to being with; to be amongst the first world being vaccine producers. What kunal doesn’t say is that India is obligated to export vaccines since they import raw materials from these countries. Also, Modi pumped up as much vaccine production through full govt support but briefly US stopped export of raw materials which led to this debacle in part. Think of what would happen if we have congress. There would have been a covid scam with all vaccine money ending up with a few politicians. Atleast we have a govt that’s working tirelessly to mitigate it. Indian citizens know the hypocrisy of Kunal and Mehdi hasan too well to fall for this. Google them up and you will find out."
2021-06-23 12:04:35,"While the handling by the government was awful, the people are mostly at fault for not listening to instructions, not getting vaccines when they were easily available and mostly treating tax avoidance as a national hobby. If you don’t pay taxes, the government cannot magically provide for you, India can’t print currency like USA nor is government responsible for everything for you.  The government is not your mai-baap. 

This will inevitably fall on deaf ears in India, the only recommendation I have is for more Indians to emigrate out of India, see how the rest of the world had formed their society and import those processes into India."

2021-06-23 13:26:26,"My husband's father was Indian, and my husband has worked in India extensively, for the Tata corporation. His opinion is that Indian Hindu culture has a lot to do with the COVID death toll - an opinion which has been borne out by other articles in this newspaper, which described Hindu holy men and other devout Hindus pooh poohing the possibility that they would catch COVID at the Kumbh Mela festival -  convinced that the gods would protect them (they didn't). Along with this superstitious and anti-scientific belief system among the undeucated, on whom Modi relies for his support, is a culture of shame - those who do get COVID must be morally lacking, as they were not protected by the gods. Hence the resistance to testing and to vaccination - testing would confirm you had the disease, which would bring shame, and vaccination would mean that you do not trust the gods to protect you, so you must be morally suspect.

Just like the US's culture of 'freedom', individuality and 'me first' led to a failure of a collective response to COVID, to the detriment of all,  so India's culture of shame and belief in divine protection led to a failure of collective response and thus to a failure to protect the whole community. Both Trump and Modi, as leaders, reflected the culture of their voters in their failed responses to the Pandemic."

They have caused the ruin of a once beautiful country and its beautiful people.  Their aim has never been the betterment of its people; rather it has been to remain in power and use any means to do so.  Modi's poor governance is directly responsible for the catastrophic loss of lives that were and are being lost in India.

We know from recordings made early in the pandemic (by author Bob Woodward) that Trump was fully aware of how deadly the pandemic would be, but was only concerned with its effect on his 2020 reelection chances.  Political vanity, indeed!  Millions of dead citizens later, Modi and Trump appear to be birds of a feather, with equally devastating consequences for their respective peoples.  

How these two men have been able to achieve such psychological residency within the minds of so many will be a lesson for the ages--and for the survival of democracy itself, should the current crisis be overcome successfully."

They should not have declared victory and instead prepared to vaccinate a mammoth 1.3 billion people. The decision to hold Kumbh Mela was disastrous and potentially political given the UP election in 2022. 

But to some extent the blame also lies with the people. I saw virtually no social distancing from the months of December 2020 till April 2021. As a matter of fact as Indian states now begin to ease restrictions after the second wave there is little social distancing or covid appropriate behaviour. We are in this together and can ease the suffering of the third wave."
2021-06-23 13:36:50,"This article shows the bias of first world media. 
First, let me just state that agree with the article's thoughts and opinions that the government is to be held responsible for the deaths and mishandling of the second wave of pandemic.

Having said that, while India peaked in new infections, the global death toll rate of India per million is less than 300, while the so-called western countries have an average death toll rate of >1000 per million. India is a country with billions. You can't factor out the largeness of the number of people while counting deaths. In a country of 300 million(like US) or 65 million (like France), the total death count is 617K in US (i.e. 1856 deaths per 1M people) and 110K in France (i.e. 1694 death per 1M people). In contrast, India is 4 times more populated than US with 1.3 billion people. One might expect that the number of deaths should be in the same ratio as that of other countries with ~1500 per million. BUT, India has total death count of 390K (i.e. less than 300 deaths per 1M people). Something or someone must be doing right? Be it vaccination, health support, providing relief and means to those who cannot sustain themselves during the prolonged lockdown. So, before the biased western media write about India takes on highest death toll count, please do a comparison and look into your countries... Rather, talk about how India is surviving and trying to grow in the midst of the pandemic in a democratic way."
2021-06-23 14:47:31,"Modi was undoubtedly a terrible leader, but don’t deny the big role of the Delta variant in India’s disaster.

Every liberal hates all so called strongmen whether its China or India so this essay is not surprising for its attack on a leader of a free country. The real problem that this guy fails to address is that Modi could not have stopped millions of Indians from this virus and the fact is Indians were not going to be locked down. That's impossible in India. This tragedy was inevitable because of how Indians themselves operate..freely and without fear from national persecution like China.  Blame Modi as much as you like but the outcome was foretold because India is India. No leader in any country has managed this virus effectively. Even the Asian tiger countries failed to control this virus after headlines indicated that they were effective. Florida has policies very similar to India but the outcome was very different because Florida is a rich state in a very rich country with a fully developed health infrastructure.

Unfortunately he and his party will be re-elected again. Because there is no other leader or party. India has only one political party BJP. Very unfortunate for a country of 1.2 billion peoples."

If PM Modi is guilty of an orchestrated massacre, then he’s culpable of much more than “political vanity”—he’s fully responsible for democide or ""the intentional killing of unarmed persons by government agents pursuant to government policy or high command."""

India had the least investment in healthcare since 1970s as compared to other BRICS nations, clearly not Modi's fault.

Kumb mela, an event where thousands and thousands of Hindus attend, was allowed; election rallies happened. All this when scientists were warning the government about the impending second surge of the pandemic. Alas, all warnings about Ides of March, went unheeded. The rest is history.

Modi declared 'victory' over Covid in January and in next couple of months, we are recording highest tally each day. The economy was already in shatters and Covid only helped Modi & Co. to put the blame on the pandemic to screen their failures.

To see how differently things have been handled, just compare Bengal with Kerala. Both states had assembly elections, and rising cases.

Modi's fault in preventing this heavily politicized disaster is marginal considering the original Wuhan strain of COVID originated from China. Several passages in humans and you have the delta variant of the Wuhan COVID viruses. Modi has no offsprings of his own and no one can blame him for the over population with inadequate managed care and supplies. Okay one can fault Modi for declaring victory over COVID after the first wave. Modi is NOT God or a virologist and he probably got poor advice. His generosity to 60 other nations including Afghanistan neglected India's need to vaccinate its own vulnerable population first. He got kudos from the WHO but he should have placed ""India First"" considering that the NY Times and others against Modi describe him as a ""nationalist"" 

So what could Modi have done differently and let us focus on the errors of Modism. He could have done what China did. Which is prepare India better for an eventuality that became a reality. He should have EXTENDED travel restrictions on Indians returning from other countries and tourists from other countries.

You can point out Gandhi and Nehru but neither was ppular among  large segment of the Hindu populace.  And the fact is more than 80% were illiterate and uneducated and were easily persuaded by the ""state-controlled"" media.  he fact is literacy ad education does lead to ""too many smart people""who do not accept the information fed to them.  Was Indira pPopular?  Was ManMohan Singh popular?"

It’s okay for the Times to give space to people who agree with its editorial position which is hostile to Modi, but only presenting its own perspective, and pumping up nincompoops to do so, puts it in the company of Fox News in terms of credibility."

The problem can be traced back to rulers since independence in 1947 who did not teach people to live in an orderly, organized and disciplined way nor developed society that way despite having huge mandate from people in election after election. On top of this there is this huge population.

Could we have expected a better response from a party that was in power between 2004-2014 and who could not even make India ready to conduct commonwealth games in 2009? The same party took India to bankruptcy in 1991 and again in 2013 with their corruption."

Heartbreak over all the burials of the poor, who did the best they could after the trauma of caring for their loved ones at home or trying desperately to find medical help. 

Yes, it was the Ganges giving up it’s dead. 
For me, that encapsulates the entire Covid  struggle of India. 
Modi can’t lie about that. He can’t spin that. 
Modi failed utterly, failing most miserably in the deepest countryside where there was no help and people knew they were doomed. 

Trump failed the United States. 600,000 dead and it wouldn’t have mattered to Trump had it been 6 million.

He was not the only one.  In January and February 2021 national and international media were reporting the success story of India in beating back COVID-19.

These are not forces of change but ideologues who don't care about facts. Those suspicions unfortunately still linger in my mind. Many of these anti-Modi / anti-India articles either lack comparative data or include wild conjectures. If how we feel about a person dictates our conclusions, we should probably not be wring journalistic pieces, no?"
2021-06-23 15:21:50,"Pinning the blame on Modi is complete nonsense. Come to India and see the real reason- people simply don’t follow the covid guidelines- no masks, no social distancing, and wild rumours about vaccines (like becoming impotent). No matter how much Modi and the govt pleads with people, people don’t follow the guidelines. It is quite frustrating. No matter which govt is in power, unless people’s behaviour changes, covid will continue to ravage India. Making Modi a scapegoat will only cause people to not face the truth - which is their own behaviour."
2021-06-23 15:37:16,"This is horrifying.  The buck stops with Modi, so it is his fault.  

Let's say he is scapegoated, never mind the problem going away, I wonder whether it would make any difference. 

I lived through the alternative to Modi; the Congress.  A party devoted to beggaring the nation, preventing any sort of entrepreneurship, business, change or innovation, and keeping people scared, poor, hungry, and desperate.  They were dramatically successful in producing the poorest, most wretched of democracies. While they lived in gilded palaces, the government had to send gold reserves to UK to get any money from international bank (1991). Then they did some window dressing and told us everything was changing.

Changing?  74 years after independence, India is yet to produce one manufactured product that the world will pay a premium for; we have occupied the cheap, crooked end of everything.  And then we speak of culture.

So the knee jerk response is: get rid of Modi, and replace him with the only alternative: Rahul Gandhi.  Sure. I stood in line as a kid to buy rationed sugar, wheat, and kerosene. I saw government thugs hold up my family routinely.  I suppose Indians want that back.  

What we must accept is that our culture of subservience, corruption, inability to innovate, fearfulness, and obsession with Ballywood -  explains a lot more of what happens to us - than any one person.  When I read the discourse that passes for intelligence in India - I week.  Hence I support Modi."

He is the one taking flack for putting all those dis gruntled and troubled Indians thoughts on camera; By now (since Modi became PM) every Indian should have understood hollowness of PM & his communal party but seems like questions are asked to Kunal the most rather than to those who were chosen to answer them.

Unless all the leaders of the ""rich world"" unite in order to fight the pandemic in the poor countries  - it will continue to spread. It really doesn't matter if we watch as the numbers of deaths rise in Brazil, Gaza, Africa or India - closing our own airports and vaccinating our own populations will not create a safe world for us all to live in.

You say you respect diversity of opinion, but I have never seen an article praising how Modi brought Pakistan to its knees during the Uri and Balakot attack? How Modi resolved the Ram Temple Ayodhya issue which was a thorn in the Indian society since hundreds of years. How he ended the Triple Talaq practice by conservative Muslims in India under the guise of 'religious freedom'? How come you have not covered how Modi has made it Businesses to operate in India easier by reducing bureaucracy? How come you did not cover how the Farm Bill Laws are going to benefit the farmers in the long run? That he his government had the wherewithal to implement GST reforms which the Congress government could not as it did not have the support of its allies, otherwise their government would have fallen down? Why have you not covered how Modi wants to help the millions of subjugated religious minorities in hatred-filled Islamic countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan etc?

2021-06-23 16:44:09,"This is unfair and one-sided narrative from the NYT, not once but several times now. Modi did
His best. He gave it all and India was relatively unscathed by the first wave. Indians see that. No comedian or the might of NyTs anti-Modism can change that. There is no connection between authoritarianism and pandemic success stories. In fact authoritarian leadership in Singapore, China and Vietnam seems to have handled things much better. India is the story of how to successfully control a pandemic’s first surge in a boisterous democracy. Modi achieved that feat. Unlike Trump, he didn’t ever ask his people to not wear masks. Never Ever. What Trump did. That was genocide of his own people. And he got what he deserved. Modi  on the other hand, went overboard with the message of masking. Even made it theatrical. People came out on their balconies to beat pots and pans to raise Covid awareness. The lockdown was the strictest anywhere in the world. All of it worked. A country of 1.3 billion with the among the worlds highest population density saw cases down to a trickle of 11,000 from January 2021 end to Mid-February, with case fatality rates that were the envy of advanced economies and healthcare systems like the US. Two weeks of just 11,000 cases — in February 2021. Even now the US  is not there yet with less than a third of India’s population.  Vaccinations in India began in January 2021. And cases have come down. Modi will prove detractors wrong. Yet again. India stands with him."

Earlier it was the fiesty Trinamool Congress leader and elected parliamentarian Mohua Moitra who made her maiden presence on NYT opinion column (May 05, 2021) by writing misleading article that claimed to have found a formula to defeat Modi. Well, it was not the TMC's acumen, but violence and rapes on the female members of the families of the BJP supporters that had catapaulted TMC to power in West Bengal state elections. The cases of violence and rapes have been filed by the victims in Supreme Court. 

In a familiar (and repetitive) blame-flaming scenario, Kunal Kamra the comedian, may have found time to come up with such a plan to put all blame on Modi. This is nothing new but the plausibility of the allegations is in grave suspect. Modi (or anyone in his place) cannot do much to quell the COVID, when many advanced countries including USA could not.  The point to be brought to notice is that AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) have now, and earlier, issued stern warnings to all citizens to obey the hygenic rules of isolation. The public ignored causing a rise by 60% in deaths. The result was the sudden peaking of the 2nd wave with all religious and other festivities going on and warnings ignored.  

Comedians & clowns can not be taken seriously."

This is where Modi has faltered .. he surrounds himself with people who are either trying to please him or are afraid to speak up. Then there is lot of hubris! India is unfortunately trapped between the arrogant right and the corrupt left. For the first 6 - 7 decades after independence from British, the left leaning Congress invested little in healthcare and other infrastructure. Instead the money was siphoned off by cronies around the leadership. India then elected a leader in 2014 who is clean on the corruption front but lacks the self-awareness needed for a inclusive leadership. Don't see that changing anytime soon."

2021-06-23 17:37:51,"Not to excuse Modi, but to provide context, to equate the deaths per million in the US, India would need to reach the following levels to equal these regions:
US                    2.5 million deaths
New Jersey      4.1 million deaths
New York City  5.4 million deaths.

India currently reports 391,000 deaths which no doubt is a great undercount. Eventually new population figures or indirect measures, such as consumption of goods, or other proxies of population will reveal the truth.
In Europe, the UK, Spain, Italy, France, have similar deaths per million, as the US. Germany is about half the figure, but since the fall, has equaled or exceeded the US per month, incapable of preventing a winter surge. Thus Germany followed a scenario similar to India, initial success, then failure equal to Trump's America. Yet no one is saying there is blood on Merkel's hands. 
In every case above, politicians made colossal mistakes which cost lives, Trump, Johnson, Sanchez, Conte, Macron, Cuomo, Murphy, De Blasio, Merkel, and throw in California Gov Newsom to boot. Texas and Florida are no worse than CA and NY.
Today, no NYC mayoral candidate drew commensurate attention to the Bronx and Brooklyn's low rate of vaccination, or possible future mandates. Why? Politics.  Only 6 covid deaths yesterday in NYC, but that rate per million is 83,000 per year for the US.
Delta variant a threat? The CDC stop collecting breakthrough data in May except for hospitalizations, a Trump like move. See MA news."
2021-06-23 18:33:42,"Despite all the self-righteous ""whataboutism"" touted by Modi's supporters, the fact remains that his refusal to respond to--and flouting of--the first appearance of the Delta variant (which originated in India) caused not just a disastrous second wave in India, but unleashed the Delta variant worldwide. It's already 20% of new US cases, doubling weekly and striking almost exclusively the unvaccinated. Had Modi not held his egotistical election rallies and not allowed those superspreader religious festivals in & near the Ganges, the variant might not have escaped the country, or at least escaped it more slowly and in smaller numbers. Instead, it is sickening and increasingly killing the unvaccinated worldwide. And part of the blame also lies with the US waiting too long to impose a ban on travel from India, as well as exempting American citizens from the ban. Unlike Trump's Muslim ban, the India travel ban is based not on ethnic bigotry but epidemiological fact and sound science. The ban should have been imposed as soon as the first Delta variant cases were reported. Would the variant have gotten here anyway through other int'l travelers arriving here who'd been to India when it first appeared? Yes--but the spread would have been delayed enough to buy us enough time to convince more people to get vaccinated and thus get us closer to our 70% vax goal. Now the barn door has been closed after the horse was stolen."

IMO, Problem is not entirely Modi or Trump or conservative or liberal authorities because everybody fumbled... the real problem is the tribalism or polarization or populace who are very eager to take sides even on simple things like wearing masks and take enormous interest in blame games which leads to misinformation, over-reactions, pre-matured celebrations etc..."

How about folks in India stop blaming the government and start taking some personal responsibility, where was the citizen’s social responsibility when they were flouting all the lockdown restrictions, clamoring for a lift of the lockdown?

First wave lockdown and management was a success people got complacent including the government, only because citizens put so much pressure on the government to relax the lockdown. To lay it all on the government and at Modi’s feet is beyond belief. 

Easy to blame the government, still developing with a crushing population, no government in India can handle a pandemic of this magnitude."

Many of them lost their loved ones cruelly and many of them could not give a decent burial. There are a number of my fellow Indians instead of holding the government accountable would be defending PM Modi for poor performance who has failed miserably in all fronts. The people of this country deserve better governance.
2021-06-23 19:03:56,"Modi has shown that he is an irresponsible heartless and religious fanatic and an autocrat. He is dressed up like a sage with long beard and acts as if he is caring. He is actually a fraud.

He belittled the seriousness of the virus, encouraged the Kumbh Mela, and conducted election rallies which were super spreaders. He must be held responsible for causing many unnecessary deaths in India. 

India being the largest producer of vaccines, he has no excuse for not producing enough for the population. He has corrupted the judiciary and even cowed the free press.

It doesn't matter who is leading the country until India confronts this."
2021-06-23 19:47:52,"A disappointing review by the left in India. A comedian who sits in a million dollar flat in Mumbai commenting on how ""bad"" Covid became in India does not move me. Also, the western media demonizing Modi for everything (and I mean everything) does not lead credence to an unbiased assessment. 

Mr Modi's response to the pandemic was far from perfect. Declaring early victory during a lull was a mistake as was arrogant as was allowing large religious gatherings. Not investing further in vaccine manufacturing was probably the biggest failure. 

However.....healthcare infranstructure in India is a state level responsibility. Ironically enough- in states where Mr. Modi's party was in power (Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, etc.) the pandemic was not nearly as bad states controlled by Modi's opposition (Maharashtra, Delhi, etc.). But fundamentally, there was no controlling this pandemic in India. A highly communicable disease in a 1.2 billion person country in 1/2 the size of the US is no controllable. This is not an excuse for Modi's failures but a mere fact. He hopefully seems to have gotten this message (8 million vaccinated yesterday) and will hopefully prepare for the third wave to come soon."
2021-06-23 19:30:58,"The author of the Opinion video (and possibly the writers of the article) is a well known (destructive) critic of Mr. Modi. As a researcher, when we publish research articles we have to disclose conflict of interest statements, wherein we state our source of funding, connections to a particular industry etc.
I think a similar convention should be established for newspaper articles. The authors must be provide their political affiliations, views etc. in the form of a statement especially for opinion pieces. Otherwise, newspapers will just be a source of biased views being reported and published."
2021-06-23 19:40:20,"It is astonishing to see someone so incompetent. Modi decreed shutdown of a country of 1.4 billion with 4 hours of notice. Result: Steepest economic decline in the whole world. Then he mismanaged or did nothing that caused biggest human tragedy in the entire world. 
It is a pattern. Before he discontinued rupee, the Indian currency to check money laundering (imagine if US discontinue dollar notes to fight illicit drugs!). That put economy in standstill. Then he invented a centralized taxation scheme for 1 billion people, 30 state speaking 14 officially recognized languages. Outcome was obvious - the economy came to standstill, again.

Question is - why people keep voting for him. Several reasons. Oppositions are silenced with threat of court cases and even jail. Then there are electronic voting machines. No one knows what they spit out, except the government who are in charge. Lastly Modi and the cabal have mastered in administering opium to the masses. The opium is caste and religion."
2021-06-23 19:45:35,India has been struggling with an over population crisis for generations. Most of the government and the elite see  a covid pandemic as an opportunity. A million dead - a hundred million dead - they think will only improve the economy and India's status in the world. Unfortunately flights to and from India are not being stopped.
2021-06-23 20:00:54,"You mean to tell me that the poorest people in a caste-based society have been left to die by the higher social elites?

It's shameful, but at least we don't have formalized castes in the West."
2021-06-23 20:20:48,"This looks like an orchestrated piece to place the entire blame on one person leave alone the administration.

I'd apportion the blame as follows 

20% to the Modi administration for pompously celebrating the end of COVID in Jan.

20% to the epidemiologists in the govt ranks who probably buckled under political pressure and did not guide the government based on science. I think most of the top positions have not been filled on merit.

20% State governments. Health is a state issue and the state governments have a big say on health policies in their state. The state governments did not think for themselves.

20% The people who have a responsibility to take care of their own health.

20% China. No explanations needed here."
2021-06-23 20:37:19,"I partially agree with Mr. Kamra when he says the ruling dispensation in India has blood on their hands. Declaring premature victory, not planning to vaccines requirement while they shipped many million vaccines to other countries under the garb of vaccine diplomacy and most importantly, not restricting large gathering are all known missteps of the govt. 

However, there is an element of personal responsibility that we are missing. When I visited India in March, I saw how everyday folk were just simply put not wearing masks nor socially distancing themselves especially in the big cities. In hindsight, the signs were there that a second wave was imminent. 

I guess the most pertinent questions we need to ask is this: What were state and central authorities doing between the first and second wave to ensure preparedness of the healthcare system? It wasn't a question of if but when the second wave would hit? Why were we scrambling for O2 concentrators and ventilators only in April-end/May first week when cases reaches 400k / day?"
2021-06-23 18:58:21,"Thanks to the immeasurably incompetent Donald John Trump, the USA had a ""state orchestrated COVID massacre"", as well.

Much of the chaos, lying, incompetence, amorality, ignorance, narcissism, fecklessness, murder, stupidity and fantasy of the Trump administration's non-handling of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 in the US has been detailed in past NYT pages, and in the new book,  “Nightmare Scenario: Inside the Trump Administration’s Response to the Pandemic That Changed History.”

There seems little doubt among rational observers of that colossal failure named Donald John Trump is personally responsible for literally hundreds of thousands of unnecessary and preventable COVID-19 deaths.

For that offense alone, irrespective of his other utter failures and criminal acts as US president, Trump should be expeditiously charged, tried, and found guilty of mass murder, and quickly and publicly hanged until dead."
2021-06-23 19:21:27,"The author's introduction is erroneous, Kunal Kamra is not a very popular stand-up comedian in India. He is best known more for creating controversy and heckling prominent journalists on a flight."
2021-06-23 20:07:00,"I hope Indians remember Modi's role in their genocide.  It has all been described well in this article. The question is .....will this con-artist be able to overcome the grief and pain he has caused the Indian people? Please India, get him out."
2021-06-23 17:56:56,"If the PM & his Govt had done just three things: 

1) not allowed super spreader events like the Kumbh Mela, the crowds at the India England cricket matches (in a stadium named after the PM) in Ahmedabad, and the massive election rallies in West Bengal, while allowing a gradual unlock of the core sectors of the economy;

2) created a cohesive and timely vaccine procurement & distribution strategy - after all, it was always known that there is a huge population to inoculate coupled with an inadequate health infrastructure - that really was not a surprise; and

3) used the same iron-fisted approach they used to censor criticism on social-media and the cries of help for people starved for oxygen, to instead quieten the quacks (mostly from, or affiliated to the ruling party) advocating for using unproven remedies like prayer & cow urine for alleviating COVID;

we would probably have seen a lower death toll and not this catastrophe. 

And at least then, statements like ""he is doing all he can, its we the Indian people who are to blame for our misfortune"" would at least have had some resonance. 

Absent these steps, everyone in this comments section who is essentially calling this piece and other coverage, a ""typical NYT-led western imperialist Judeo-Christian plot to malign the PM, and consequently India and its magnificent culture and history"" is just straight-up delusional."
2021-06-23 20:16:55,BRAVO  AND RESPECT.
2021-06-23 20:28:59,"America's self-chosen and self-anointed-one appears to be Modi's role model and inspiration for orchestrating a similar massacre on a much larger scale in India. As for those 60 million vaccines manufactured in India, the inhumanity of the free-market decides where they will go. I am sure there are elites who have profited and added to their ungodly wealth hoards during this calamity just as elites in our country have. No humor in that."
2021-06-23 19:28:29,Modi was too busy vilifying Muslims and pandering to his Hindu supplicants.
2021-06-23 15:36:04,"THANK YOU KUNAL, and THANK YOU NYTIMES. I am so amazed and delighted that a platform as huge as the NYTimes gave you a platform, and I am SO amazed, impressed, and uplifted by your boldness in pulling no punches at the utterly evil BJP and Modi-Shah regime. 

People forget that Modi was BANNED from entering the US for years for his (correctly) suspected role in the Gujarat riots. The guys who should have been in jail are sitting and running the world's largest democracy. 

What saddens me is that maybe in 2024 elections, India will vote these murderers out; but does this mean my fellow Hindus care only when their own kind die? Why did Modi-Shah come to power despite what happened in Gujarat in 2002? 

I am so frustrated by India, so very frustrated by it. On paper, in our constitution, we are such a great country. How on earth do such people come to power then? The blame doesn't lie on just Modi-Shah. If there is blood on their hands, there's blood on the hands of everyone who voted them to power, because they KNEW what these guys had done in the past, and they CHOSE to turn a blind eye to it. 

The word ""karma"" comes from Sanskrit, where it just means ""duty"". In English, today we use ""karma"" to mean ""the result of your past actions"". I want to tell my fellow Indians - specifically my fellow upper-caste Hindus - who voted for the BJP, that THIS right now is ""karma"" in the English sense."
2021-06-23 20:42:29,Sounds quite familiar.
2021-06-23 20:39:25,"While Modi has been a modernizer in some respects, he also has a strong authoritarian stream and impulsive behavior. He pandered to hindu religious sentiment by allowing mass pilgrimages and also conducted a massive election campaign unmasked and with huge crowds. These together lead to the COVID disaster. So he has a huge responsibility for this tragedy. 

Unfortunately, there are many folks who believe that he is a ""strong leader"" and ""very manly"" and ""protector of the hindus"" and so on. That might remind you of another politican! And these folks will never agree to acknowledge his role in this disaster."
2021-06-23 11:26:47,"From the beginning the Indian death toll is far greater than has been reported. 

As a result of many factors,  Modi's lack of integrity heading the list, and the crushingly dense population of the country, diagnosing and properly attributing the dead to Covid is near impossible. 

Many orders of magnitude greater than has been publicized have already succumbed,  and is certain to continue. 

Their only hope to stem the spread is to get into the villages with a concerted effort and steadfast resolution to vaccinate as many as possible, as quickly as is doable."
2021-06-23 19:53:47,"Banging thali, lighting diya candles, these popular methods will cheer up the afflicted anyway. Then there is bovine organic waste to help reduce corona infection. India can do it.  Sputnik vaccine is beyond the reach of ordinary folks, and Modi will not let profiteering during the pandemic. Go Modi Go!!"
2021-06-23 21:36:47,"More than 50+ in my first circle either died or their direct family member's died in that one month. This failure is not only left at Modi's feet but at a large number of state governments, including AAP (Am Admi Party) in Delhi. It was a month of nightmares. 

As the world slept - India fell into great darkness. 

Not only did our politicians fail us but so did the ""Steel structure"" of India our civil servants who spent more time harassing people, sending foolish notices, and running their usual petty extortion scams. 

All of us barely got a few hours of sleep at night trying to coordinate to arrange beds, oxygen, and transport. In Delhi, even the extremely rich realized they could not buy an ICU bed spot because there were none available and patients were spilling into corridors. We now are seeing a mass migration of those who can afford to leave. They don't want to be here for the third wave. 

There is so much blame to go around that I am afraid a conspiracy to cover up by all those in power is well on its way. Not just supported by Modi - but by all those who look in the mirror and realized their own contribution. 

Independent estimates put the death toll at least 3 million and probably much more than that.

Meanwhile, recently, India's education regulator has ordered all universities to hang posters thanking PM Modi for arranging free for all vaccines."
2021-06-23 21:53:09,"Although criticism of Modi has a legitimate basis, given the recent surge, when the pandemic first began, in early 2020, Modi was one of the leaders who took the pandemic seriously.  He did not deny or downplay the severity, urged wearing of masks and social distancing, and closed the economy, which was heavily criticized by the opposition.  

Modi took the pandemic much more seriously than leaders such as Trump.  Modi did not spread disinformation about treatment or vaccines.

Given the poverty and that it is not possible for most people to work from home or survive without working every day, it is difficult to implement measures long term.

Modi did declare victory too early,  for which he should be held responsible.  Speaking to my family members who live in India, I was shocked when they would inform me that almost everyone had stopped taking the pandemic seriously and started disregarding safety advice, including educated and informed people.  So there is definitely culpability there.

There is also a lot of misinformation about vaccines which will be another problem that will affect dealing with this effectively.

Even the US finds it difficult to battle skepticism regarding the pandemic and need for vaccination, despite all access to scientific information.  This will be even more problematic in India."
2021-06-23 22:00:29,"India like the US is made up of a number of states and most state governments (and many of them are non-BJP) have a lot of power to control healthcare within their own state and not listen to Modi's rules except for last's year national lockdown which wasn't done this year. The highest infections recorded (again based on reported cases) were in Kerala and Maharashtra - two states administrated by non BJP parties, while Kerala had elections Maharashtra did not have and neither states are big Kumbh participants. While the Modi government can't be absolved, the familiar line of criticism from a insular group of critics really represents  crying Wolf - these critics have not seen anything good being done by the Modi government since day - 1 and with the polity and society polarised credibility is lost across the board. When Trump said about lab leak it was racist but now that Biden administration is probing that angle it no longer sounds xenophobic - the media has a large part in reducing its own credibility by focusing on the messenger and not the merits of the message. People believe what they want to with the slide starting probably from the ""discovery"" of WMDs in Iraq."
2021-06-23 22:08:29,"Besides the PM Modi, I think the responsibility also falls on individuals who ignored the scientists and the safety rules. But I stand 100% behind Mr. Kamra for expressing his views freely and wish him the best. I hope the Indian Government does not stoop to such a low level that they need to arrest this guy for speaking  his mind. Free speech should only be responded to by Free speech.

This is a very important concept and the only positive aspect for India in a very repressive geographic region where it is surrounded by Islamic and Communist Republics. China today shut down the only free newspaper in Hong Kong today."
2021-06-23 23:52:29,We lost one of team members who works in our Mumbai office. He was 27 year old. I can only imagine the scale of this tragedy if even a young affluent person did not get medical help for so long that he eventually perished. The true fatalities are likely in the millions.
2021-06-23 21:06:31,Sometimes the coverup is worse than the crime.
2021-06-23 22:13:12,"The BJP cannot but do the 'India Shining' trick.  The 'Currency Disaster' was its second. The 'Covid Disaster' is its third trick.  
It may lose power over this trisk, but when it comes back it will have another trick to act out.  The BJP cannot help itself."
2021-06-23 21:03:39,Modi and his government are the worst that has happened to India. I've heard losses from my friends and extended family for the past 15 months and especially more since Feb 2021.
2021-06-23 21:35:54,"Hopefully this is the end of he right-modi and all the excesses of his government. Like Trump didn’t do anything for the working class, the poor that in India amounts to hundreds of millions.                                          Hopefully India will become the largest democracy in the world, as a fact… not only as political slogan.                                              The entitled Hindu authorities are the worst enemies of other religions and lower casts."
2021-06-23 23:23:49,"When PM Modi installed the first lockdown--without notice to the mass poor--the world saw a horrible side of India. The dangerous trains, the millions of poor workers literally walking hundreds of miles to get home, and the deep disparity between the elite and the poor. India is no different from the many corrupt former Imperial Colonies with horrible, terrible governments who choose votes over quality of life for the nation. From Africa to the Caribbean to Asia....the footprints are hard to erase..."
2021-06-23 21:19:26,"A recent article on Scroll.in asked voters who voted for Modi to take stock of the situation and see the havoc he has caused.

The responses to the article show that support for Modi remains strong. (<a href=""https://scroll.in/article/998208/readers-comments-on-a-letter-to-modi-voters-we-will-still-elect-him-as-the-pm-again"" target=""_blank"">https://scroll.in/article/998208/readers-comments-on-a-letter-to-modi-voters-we-will-still-elect-him-as-the-pm-again</a>)

For many Hindu electorates, Modi has become a messiah figure who's supposed to be the savior of Hindus. Criticism of him reads as a criticism of Hindusim to many in India. It's baffling to see a complex religion being reduced to the stupidity of one man. Modi's voters in India are prone to saying, ""Hindu khaterein mein hai,"" (Hindus are in danger). And indeed they are. From him. And the hateful ideology he espouses."
2021-06-23 21:19:02,"Thanks Mr. Kamra, for this poignant opinion video. Modi has demonstrated yet again that he values human life only as long as it advances his political agenda. In spite of initiating, and subsequently condoning the Gujarat Pogrom in 2002, he got elected as the PM. ""Elect a clown and you get a circus"" - You are absolutely right! This narcissist and his kakistocracy will create a lot more damage  in the region, unless he is kicked out as soon as possible."
2021-06-24 00:49:11,"India used to be a diversified modern country, at least that is what I thought. However, it has made a hard right religion-based idealistic turn by electing religious bigots as their leaders. The way Donald Trump will be viewed in history as the main cause of COVID deaths in USA, his follower Howdy Modi will be viewed as the reason India suffered. The way most of the comments are trying to downplay the seriousness of the issue and trying to put the blame on the critics is a sad testament how low India has reached under the leadership of a religious bigot!"
2021-06-23 20:54:53,And doesn't Kamra's conclusion sound similar to the lack of cogent response to the virus by the former U.S. president and the current Brazilian leader? When leaders are driven by ambition and greed they risk killing their citizens in this vile and ignorant and way. As long as they are personally safe they rest easy.
2021-06-23 22:25:33,"It is important that people can air their thoughts like Kunal Kamra does here freely. 
However, does the Times recognize that cremation represents a holy ritual for Hindus in India and there are real families who are suffering that wish to be private? This is classic example of photojournalists who will go to any length for shock value!  Were families of these victims consented before pictures of their loved ones in funeral pyres get displayed? Of course not...ethics never applied for the underprivileged!"
2021-06-23 22:53:46,And how do you call what Trump did here. I read some comments and they look like they are coming from some other country.
2021-06-23 22:09:16,"Thank you NYT for keeping up your excellent coverage on this unforgiveable man-made carnage. Well done to Kunal Kamra for speaking out in the current atmosphere of lies and fear that the government has generated. Indians deserve better, even though many fools and bigots among them elected this deranged leader."
2021-06-23 21:41:47,"It's horrible and I feel pain for the people of India, Modi is all about self preservation and detests the poor population of India. Exactly what we had here and if we don't watch it we'll have it here again."
2021-06-23 20:45:31,"Leaders that lie bring death to their people - ancient saying, but never more true than now.  Trump led the pack and I wish more was written about the continued devastation that is occurring here, as well as in India and Brazil.

I still can't get over people denying the reality of the pandemic, refusing to understand their lives are at stake and willfully consigning themselves to a possible death or debilitating disease when a little care would prevent it all.  

My heart breaks for what many of these people have had to endure and more will.  All because of the hubris of a few murderous leaders.  The odd thing is, history will write these liars epitaphs and they know it.  And they can't help themselves from consigning their names and their families to shame and ridicule just to appease some madness they possess."
2021-06-23 23:19:22,"The realization is slow, if not - not at all. Polarized minds budge, slowly. Critical Thinking is not an easy association that people make with comedians and cartoonists. They need to tease through the irony, the paradox and the conundrums to create the humour they are known for.   
For those not willing to see their naivete for what it is - I say this to them ""Please keep your joker in your arena. Your imposition of his antics upon us all has consequences, that the circus tent canopy can ill afford to expand. It is the economy that has inflated, and not the tent you put your refuge in. Even basic paracetamol was not available to doctors who gasped for want of oxygen in the month of May 2021. Spare us your toxic positivity, and pack your pockets with all that you wish to store of it. If you can't process pain and suffering, you deny your essence and inflict your ignorance upon people who want to live on past their struggles"""
2021-06-24 00:41:38,"Mr. Modi is a polarizing figure; a new generation is rising with him, a new order cometh. The matter of equal concern is about the forum in which this article has been written. It is a matter to be discussed within India first. 

Press freedom has been a big issue right from mid-sixties, after demise of Nehru. The Soviet style control of banking muzzled press. Private sector had to be in cohort with governments in power to succeed in business. The nexus is far deeper than what we call lobbying.

Modi government, is the first one with an explicit political commitment to privatize most of banking, and this structural change would have a disproportionate impact on increasing press freedom. The political and bureaucratic  resistance against is very deep rooted and they may succeed in scuttling reforms. 

Most of the Modi bashers are left-liberal-secular kind who stand to gain most if reforms succeed in opening up Indian economy. Hope these folks listen to reason, analyze deeper and seek to discern truth with fidelity. 

The author has felt Covid impact deeply, his parents were sick. His concern is genuine and so is anger. To infer that emotions expressed by Modi in Parliament were histrionic may be true, may be not. I respect Modi and believe, sans evidence, they are not. 

Hope NYT builds bridges with all Indians, and comes with bit more realistic assessment of Modi. Hope the reforms succeed and articles like this get first published in India, then repeated elsewhere."
2021-06-24 00:19:30,"While Modi has clearly been a disaster, a lot of Indians, who voted for Modi, are also responsible for this tragedy.  Modi has sold fancy dreams - space mission to Mars, membership of UN Security Council, Ram temple, IIT and IIM in every state.  People loved these dreams and voted for him.  How can they not notice the lack of basic infrastructure?

While there is criticism of Modi, there is little discussion of a long term solution.  India needs to invest a lot more in basic education and healthcare.  Otherwise, we are looking at one off ( but recurring) crises and one off responses."
2021-06-23 12:10:45,"Perhaps this will be the start of a real reckoning with caste.

2021-06-24 17:57:43,"Just remember we're only 18 months into a 3-4 year pandemic, and I think it would be wise to refocus on the global picture- at least for the moment. If the ""Spanish Flu"" serves as any kind of precedent, 2/3 of the world's 7.5 billion souls will have to become infected (or vaccinated) and become immune to it (and all of its variants) to bring it to a conclusion. At this point in the process 100 years ago, the ""second wave"" was killing millions. Yes, things look pretty good (at the moment) for the ""healthy, wealthy and wise"" NYT readers, but much of the rest of America and the world could be better characterized as ""impoverished, ignorant and diseased"". It might be ""winding down"" for you, but it's on the rise elsewhere and the ""rest of the story"" still needs to be told. Better to keep it going too long rather than to close it down too soon. Perhaps if the CDC stepped up and carried the ball... but I don't see much sign of them doing that. They're still in the disinformation business, I think."
2021-06-24 22:55:13,"This is what happens when you can't rely on the CDC (prior management) for data and information. Fortunately, we have people at the NYT and Johns Hopkins with the capability and willingness to jump in, grab the bull by the horn and help out. 

Thank you for all you have done."
2021-06-25 04:57:43,"That's very impressive work.

Early in the pandemic, I went directly to the CDC web site for information but found nothing but bland and often confusing statements. 

So I've been relying on the Johns Hopkins Covid 19 website, which is so easy to navigate for regional, national and international pandemic numbers. The daily NYT Covid 19 updates were wonderful; I set it to report on my state and several communities of interest to me.

But I wonder that such detailed data were available for the asking. 
Trump had diverted the reporting of Covid cases/deaths from hospitals/clinics away from the CDC (which had been the customary recipient) and to the White House.  So how did a newspaper, even a major one, get itself into flow of medical information?  

Where the Johns Hopkins and NYT data are the same, I wonder if they are in agreement.

In all good research reports, the authors identify problems in their data collection, such as non-responders and the reliability of their various sources of data. It would be good if the Times and the JHU did as well."
2021-06-26 16:58:37,"The coverage provided by the NYT was absolutely phenomenal.

It was nothing less than a reliable touchstone for an anxious world in desperate need of facts and truth-telling -- especially given the countervailing propaganda continuously spewed by the past American administration, and its muzzling of its own scientists.

Bravo! 

And thank you from a grateful reader."
2021-06-25 02:26:42,"Thank you for this wonderful resource. I look at it every day (as well as our local data) and it gives a granular picture of our situation. I love scrolling my cursor over the dates, and looking at the trends in the states. 

Cases have been flat recently, averaging around 11K/day, but what is happening is some states are going down and others going up. Right now Missou has the most cases per 100K (12) and has increased over 50% in the last two weeks. Arkansas is close behind (10) and also has increased over 50%. Both are states have average vaccination percentages. However, according to data on Eric Topol's Twitter page, both are seeing a high prevalence of the more contagious delta variant. It is probable that the DV will start feasting on states with low vaccination percentages, and we will have another wave, maybe a mini-one like that of the alpha variant in April, or maybe more severe. I've been enjoying greater freedom and not wearing a mask recently and hope we don't have to go back to before. 

Since the vaccines are still effective the delta variant, although less so, we need more people vaccinated and soon, and this will be nowhere close to over until the rest of the world is vaccinated. I'm worried, but hoping for the best. Thank you again for pulling together this resource. Your Pulitzer for this and your Covid coverage in general is well deserved."
2021-06-25 11:57:00,"I have seen from other sources that the number of people dying each day in the US is mostly unvaccinated people. It would be helpful, I think, if you broke down the deaths per day to the number of deaths for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. It appears that almost all of the deaths now are unvaccinated people.

2021-06-24 17:57:43,"Just remember we're only 18 months into a 3-4 year pandemic, and I think it would be wise to refocus on the global picture- at least for the moment. If the ""Spanish Flu"" serves as any kind of precedent, 2/3 of the world's 7.5 billion souls will have to become infected (or vaccinated) and become immune to it (and all of its variants) to bring it to a conclusion. At this point in the process 100 years ago, the ""second wave"" was killing millions. Yes, things look pretty good (at the moment) for the ""healthy, wealthy and wise"" NYT readers, but much of the rest of America and the world could be better characterized as ""impoverished, ignorant and diseased"". It might be ""winding down"" for you, but it's on the rise elsewhere and the ""rest of the story"" still needs to be told. Better to keep it going too long rather than to close it down too soon. Perhaps if the CDC stepped up and carried the ball... but I don't see much sign of them doing that. They're still in the disinformation business, I think."

2021-06-25 04:57:43,"That's very impressive work.

Early in the pandemic, I went directly to the CDC web site for information but found nothing but bland and often confusing statements. 

So I've been relying on the Johns Hopkins Covid 19 website, which is so easy to navigate for regional, national and international pandemic numbers. The daily NYT Covid 19 updates were wonderful; I set it to report on my state and several communities of interest to me.

But I wonder that such detailed data were available for the asking. 
Trump had diverted the reporting of Covid cases/deaths from hospitals/clinics away from the CDC (which had been the customary recipient) and to the White House.  So how did a newspaper, even a major one, get itself into flow of medical information?  

Where the Johns Hopkins and NYT data are the same, I wonder if they are in agreement.

In all good research reports, the authors identify problems in their data collection, such as non-responders and the reliability of their various sources of data. It would be good if the Times and the JHU did as well."

2021-06-25 02:26:42,"Thank you for this wonderful resource. I look at it every day (as well as our local data) and it gives a granular picture of our situation. I love scrolling my cursor over the dates, and looking at the trends in the states. 

Cases have been flat recently, averaging around 11K/day, but what is happening is some states are going down and others going up. Right now Missou has the most cases per 100K (12) and has increased over 50% in the last two weeks. Arkansas is close behind (10) and also has increased over 50%. Both are states have average vaccination percentages. However, according to data on Eric Topol's Twitter page, both are seeing a high prevalence of the more contagious delta variant. It is probable that the DV will start feasting on states with low vaccination percentages, and we will have another wave, maybe a mini-one like that of the alpha variant in April, or maybe more severe. I've been enjoying greater freedom and not wearing a mask recently and hope we don't have to go back to before. 

Since the vaccines are still effective the delta variant, although less so, we need more people vaccinated and soon, and this will be nowhere close to over until the rest of the world is vaccinated. I'm worried, but hoping for the best. Thank you again for pulling together this resource. Your Pulitzer for this and your Covid coverage in general is well deserved."

2021-06-30 18:24:20,"A question I haven't seen answered: I understand that the rare breakthrough infections among the vaccinated are likely to be mild, but do you still run the risk of those long-haul symptoms that some people suffer?"
2021-06-30 18:27:30,"It might be helpful to clarify the numbers cited in this article on breakthrough cases. The article states ""the C.D.C. reported that 4,115 patients had Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough infections, including 3,907 who had been hospitalized and 750 who had died."" That's a little misleading. Those numbers are actually shown on the CDC website as ""Hospitalized or fatal vaccine breakthrough cases reported to CDC"". The article presents the figures as a total number of breakthrough cases, when they are more accurately only the hospitalized or fatal breakthrough cases. Prior to the CDC's change in monitoring breakthrough cases on May 1, the number of breakthrough cases cited by the CDC was actually much higher (10,262 as of April 30). 

The overall point that vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization and death is no less valid, but it's not as valid to say that vaccines are highly effective against breakthrough cases because those numbers just aren't being tracked. If most vaccinated people would be asymptomatic in a breakthrough case, then we have no idea how many breakthrough cases happen when people are unaware they even have it (and therefore never have a positive test). It's interesting that in situations where people are regularly tested, we are seeing a higher rate of breakthrough cases than the data would suggest is expected (i.e. the Yankees and the NC State). Again, those vaccinated individuals are mostly asymptomatic, which again proves the vaccines work."
2021-06-30 18:28:28,One question that I have: why are pharmacies where the vaccine is being administered allowed to have a “mask-optional” policy for other people (i.e. shoppers) in the same building?  Seems like they should be in the same category as hospitals and doctors offices…

Vaccines protect against the variants, but conflicting advice from health authorities about masks has bewildered a worried public.""

I've just had my first Covid shot today.  To my great and actual surprise, as for the shot, it was no big deal.  I am the worst when it comes to shots, needles, stinging injections.  But there was no bad feelings this time, none, nada.

If folks have been avoiding the shots out of whatever fears,  don't delay any longer.  The needle did not hurt because it is very thin.  The vaccine did not hurt, did not sting.  The injection was over faster than you could the the word BING!
Since getting the shot this morning, I've not had any bad reaction, no stiff or sore arm, no lingering problems.

If you are afraid of shots, forget it, this was  as quick and easy as it could be.  Protect yourself, go get the shot, it does NOT hurt."
2021-06-30 18:38:27,CDC epitomizing selfishness. Fully vaccinated can still be carriers and can infect others i.e. under 12 and other vulnerable groups. It is better to err on the side of caution during pandemic.
2021-06-30 18:53:07,"Why are unvaccinated people told to wear masks inside - for their protection or for the protection of others?

When the CDC tells vaccinated people it’s okay not to wear masks indoors, in part as an incentive to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated, it feels like they are using us as guinea pigs in the gamble to reach heard immunity.

If it were truly safe to mix indoors with the unvaccinated, then why are the unvaccinated disallowed at Springsteen and Morgan Stanley, just to name a few?"

2021-06-30 19:16:19,"Just a little addition of an anecdotal reason to continue wearing masks: all those other viruses besides Covid 19…I’m fully vaccinated by the Moderna vaccine and have been since early April…and I also got a regular flu vaccine in Dec…but I’ve recently gone out to some crowded indoor events and contracted a regular rhinovirus…I know this bc I am dealing with serious enough chest congestion to visit a CityMD for a rapid and a PCR Covid test, both negative…the attending physician said that all of those regular viruses and colds we avoided last season bc of mask wearing grew stronger and our immune systems are compromised…so a cold becomes a COLD…a rhinovirus becomes a RHINOVIRUS…yes masks in the summer are no fun but my chest cold is much worse…"
2021-06-30 19:18:14,"Before most people started wearing masks in NYC, my wife wisely suggested that wearing a mask as a social signal was important. Wearing masks reminded people that the pandemic was dangerous and that we needed to look out for each other, even if some people were still skeptical. 
I got Covid much later, and after that I got the full Moderna vaccine (2 injections), so I’m considered an extremely low risk for getting or spreading Covid. 
However, I’m still wearing a mask as a social signal in many settings where people congregate. 
Stay safe, friends!"
2021-06-30 19:21:07,"It seems the same CDC who abruptly said it was okay not to wear masks is now slow to want to endorse mask-wearing again.  The breakthrough numbers of the Delta variant in Israel and other countries among the vaccinated seems to be alarmingly high.  

I know people don't relish wearing masks, but it really is better protection for us all until more people in this country choose to become vaccinated."
2021-06-30 19:22:20,"I went to an hour long meeting yesterday in a large well ventilated room with a high ceiling, with about 20 people half of whom had been vaccinated. We distanced and talked quietly. 
I felt fine to take off my mask. 
When I grocery shop, I go early. Often there are only two or three shoppers in the store. I feel ok to take off my mask but at busy times I wear it. 
I had the moderna vaccine in mid January and because I have been ill, I asked my dr for a spike protein antibody test a month ago and my results were that I am strongly protected against COVID 19. 
Good to know. I was concerned because of illness and weight loss but I am rebounding and feel ok to go maskfree at certain times. 
I don’t need the CDC to tell me to use common sense. 
I also don’t blame the CDC because COVID is a rapidly changing virus. I don’t think people realize how tough it’s been. 
Remember too, Biden inherited Trump’s CDC and he inherited it in the middle of a global pandemic. 
Trump lied 24/7 about COVID and told his agencies to lie as well. Take that into account."
2021-06-30 19:23:18,"""Vaccinated and confused""
  It is amazing even educated people in this country are confused about wearing masks after vaccinated. 
   If you follow the news closely and listen to health authorities there is no need for confusion. it is all common sense. Health authorities are not issuing any conflicting messages. Their message is very clear but people don't listen or read carefully.
1)  a fully vaccinated person needs to wear a mask really depends on the circumstances and what’s happening in your community.
2) Mask mandates are largely intended to protect the unvaccinated — people who are vaccinated are already well protected by vaccines, and breakthrough infections are still very rare.
3)  Since you can’t always tell who is vaccinated and who is not, telling everyone to wear a mask can help stop the spread of the virus by people who are infected but don’t have any symptoms.
4) The World Health Organization wants everybody to wear masks because the W.H.O. is providing guidance for the whole world, and in areas where Delta is dominant, cases are high, vaccination rates are low, and the vaccines that have been distributed are less effective against Delta, it makes sense for vaccinated people to wear masks,
5) About the Delta variant: If you are fully vaccinated with m RNA vaccines, your risk of getting infected is extremely low.
 You cannot be more specific than that."
2021-06-30 19:26:45,"My daughter is an entering first-year student at The University of the South in Sewanee, TN, which is not requiring students to be vaccinated and is not assigning roommates based on vaccination status. We (and she) are concerned. The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that 544 US campuses are requiring vaccination. I think most of these are in Blue states. I am currently seeking clarification on whether she can request a vaccinated roommate. I get the sense that they didn't think about this. They have clearly not prepared for it. Students must report their vaccination status to the University and those not vaccinated are required to be tested each week. They will pay for these tests, unless they file for a religious or medical exemption. It is certainly not the University's intent, but it seems that they are catering to anti-vaccination folks of whatever rationale and not to students who are basing their lives on science and social responsibility. We'll see...."

2021-06-30 19:30:48,"I would like a clear explanation on if/to what extent fully vaccinated people can spread the virus. In my limited understanding, I believe the vaccine limits the potential of a viral load being transmitted, but I would like a scientific answer with probabilities per vaccine and virus variant."
2021-06-30 19:32:29,"The types of masks most people wear do not protect the wearer. They provide some protection for other people. If you wear a mask in a setting where nobody else is wearing one you are not protected. If you happen to be infected with Covid maybe you won’t spread it to an unvaccinated person if you are masked. But the unmasked unvaccinated person clearly does not care if they have Covid and might infect others so why should I go out of my way to wear a mask if I’m vaccinated if many others aren’t. 
The only way to truly protect yourself is to wear a fit tested N95 mask or a powered air purifying respirator. Not practical for most people."
2021-06-30 19:32:47,"Many vaccinated people are very resentful of the unvaccinated. 
It’s tempting to be angry but I was at urgent care last week and a woman in her early 20’s came in. 
The woman had Covid symptoms and they swept her into a room quickly but first the nurse had to show her how to put on a mask. 

A woman in her 20’s didn’t know how to put on a mask at this point in the pandemic. 
I then realized that for whatever reason some people are caught in a web of ignorance or fear  (or both) and they just don’t get it. 
So they sure don’t need my resentment or anger. 
I think they need my patience. 
The gal was sick and very scared. And alone."
2021-06-30 19:37:22,Is it at all possible for the fully vaccinated to spread infection to the non-vaccinated?
2021-06-30 19:37:36,"“You have to trust that the other people you’re coming into contact with are vaccinated if they’re not wearing a mask,” said Dr. Offit. “That’s a lot to trust. The same people who aren’t masked often aren’t vaccinated. Those two things usually go hand in hand. When you see people masked inside, they’re often the ones who are vaccinated.”

That says it all.

Also, as a mother with an 8 and an 11 year old, I really wish they had decided to ease restrictions after my kids were eligible.  Now I'm afraid to take them with me even to the grocery store, where down here almost nobody is masked up (which, considering vaccination rates in Georgia, is pretty suspicious).

Once everyone is eligible and the only people unvaccinated are those are CHOOSING not to be, then you can talk about easing mask requirements.  This was a grave error on the part of the CDC."
2021-06-30 19:38:08,Would like some information on people such as my wife that have had covid and the one-shot J&J vaccine.   What would be their minimal percentage of protection?
2021-06-30 19:41:56,"Are the vaccines safe and effective?  Absolutely they are, and for that reason, everyone should get vaccinated.  However, a vaccine ""95% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death"" doesn't quite mean what a lot of vaccinated people think it means.  Although a vaccinated person is roughly 20 times less likely than an unvaccinated person to suffer these bad outcomes, risk rises for everyone, unvaccinated and vaccinated, in proportion to local viral activity.  

Thus, the amount of risk experienced by a vaccinated person in a community where prevalence rises 20-fold would equal the risk to an unvaccinated person in a community without such a rise.  

The risks for the elderly are even higher, as fully vaccinated people over age 75 continue to have a 6-8% risk of hospitalization, and approximately a 1-2% risk of death if they become infected.  

Against a highly transmissible and harmful variant such as Delta, the best way to protect the unvaccinated, the immunocompromised, the vaccinated elderly, and everyone else, is to keep prevalence low.  The best way to do that is not only for everyone to get vaccinated, but also - critically - for everyone to mask and distance in public as local prevalence rises."
2021-06-30 19:50:53,"Great to know that those vaccinated with either Pfizer or Moderna are well protected against Delta. But for those poor souls (including myself) who received the “other” vaccine (J&J), the CDC needs to step on the gas and determine what the actual level of protection is, is it sufficient, and do we need a booster. “66, but maybe 60 but who knows for sure” isn’t cutting it for me."

2021-06-30 20:07:51,"1. If a person who is vaccinated who has underlying health issues, such as diabetes, heart problems, compromised immune system and is older, do they have a higher level of risk than a vaccinated person without these issues? That is, if a breakthrough occurs, will their chances of hospitalization and death be greater than the person without these issues?

2. Wearing a mask is primarily supposed to help prevent an infected person from infecting someone else, correct? It may provide the wearer with a little protection. Is this slight protection by wearing a mask a valid reason why a vaccinated person should wear it?"
2021-06-30 20:15:37,"The CDC may say vaccinated individuals are generally safe to go unmasked, but the people least likely to wear masks are the militant anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers. Continued insistance that vaccinated individuals don't have to wear masks  just enables the anti-vaxxers to spread disease and misery.

Absent a system to distinguish responsible vaccinated individuals from the militants, the CDC should recognize this problem and issue guidance that all must be masked to deny the militants their cover. 

Until this country recognizes that the anti-vaxxers are the same right-wing extremists that serious non-partisan law enforcement recognizes as terrorists, we will continue to be imperiled by what is essentially a biological warfare attack on America."

Both of their parents have been vaccinated as well as their teenage twin girls. 
Should we be concerned, due to the D variant? That is, the possibility that the 4 year old might become infected and pass it on to us, as a breakthrough?"
2021-06-30 20:28:02,"The advice to look at your local conditions and vaccination rates makes sense. In my area, over 80% of people are vaccinated, new cases are close to zero, and the hospital has had virtually no COVID cases in weeks, if not months. So, I’m following CDC and state health guidelines for the fully vaccinated—the current science, in other words—and not wearing a mask except in situations where it’s required. (Then I’ll gladly put one on.) The unvaccinated or people with concerns about not masking up should by all means do what’s best for them, in accordance with trusted local public health recommendations. The media is too often making this more complicated than it needs to be. I appreciate this article for the way it simplifies some of the unhelpful noise."

We need the rest of you to help protect us. I’m fully vaccinated, but I am on an immunosuppressant drug right now, which puts me in the same category as unvaccinated people. I’m mostly housebound because you people out there don’t care about people like me. Where is the golden rule?"
2021-06-30 20:59:17,"""the problem with the current guidance about mask wearing in the United States is that it requires trust . . . The same people who aren’t masked often aren’t vaccinated. Those two things usually go hand in hand.""

This is the fundamental problem right now.  

On a recent family vacation to Colorado, we stayed at a fancy 5-star resort with probably staff of over 1,000, and even there only about 5% of people were masked (including staff).  My wife and I (both vaccinated) wore our masks, mainly in solidarity with our young kids (under age 12) who have to wear masks indoors.  

Through this newspaper you can look up the vaccination rate of any county in the US and you will see many, many counties where only around 55% of eligible people ages 12 and up are vaccinated, including where we were in Colorado.

That means about 1/2 the people you see without a mask indoors are not vaccinated against a pandemic disease that spreads from an infected person for a week before they become symptomatic and realize they are sick!

In fact, staff even kept telling us, ""hey you don't need to wear a mask, the governor lifted the mandate!""  To which we replied that we're wearing them for our kids.  To which one replied, ""it's okay, I'm not vaccinated either!"""
2021-06-30 21:01:15,"It will be interesting to see how much viral prevalence rises in American metro areas with high vaccination rates.  Aside from families with young children who are not yet vaccine eligible and those with health conditions that render their immune systems less efficient, there appear to be very few people continuing to mask or distance in public.   

In this setting, it appears we are getting ready to test the hypothesis that Rt for the Delta variant, a real-time estimate of the number of new infections caused by each contagious person, remains less than one in these highly vaccinated areas.  If it remains below one, prevalence remains low.  If it rises above one, viral prevalence rises exponentially until measures are taken to bring it back below one.  

Fortunately, we aren't in the dark.  Real-time data from analogous nations where Delta has become dominant can help guide policy here.  The experiences of the UK and Israel, nations that have vaccinated a somewhat higher percentage of their populations than we have, should make us sit up and take notice.  Israel has had an Rt in the ballpark of 2 for the last couple weeks.  The UK has sustained an Rt north of 1 for nearly two months.  As a consequence, prevalence has risen roughly 8-fold in both of these countries.

We would be wise to follow the WHO's recommendations for the fully vaccinated on masking and distancing, until the CDC eventually bows to reality and updates their guidance.  Let's hope they do so soon."
2021-06-30 21:01:44,"I am fully vaccinated but take an immune suppressing medication.  I cannot get any clarity about my level of risk, so I am venturing out more, staying masked, and living with the anxiety and unknown."
2021-06-30 21:08:29,"In an area where 60 out of 100 people over 12 are fully vaccinated and masking is optional, for every 100 people you see at the grocery store, 10 are children too young to be vaccinated (and more susceptible to the delta variant), 40 are unmasked and 50 are masked. Of the 90 adults, 54 adults (60% of the 90) are fully vaccinated and 36 are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated. In the U.S., masking is political, so the 30 percent of adults who aren’t vaccinated (27 people at the store in this example) are the same ones who watch and believe IrresponsibleNews and refuse to wear a mask. Therefore, out of 100 people at the store, 37 unmasked people are unvaccinated and 13 are fully vaccinated. Among the masked 50, 41 are fully vaccinated and most of the remaining 9 are likely partially vaccinated (with perhaps 1 or 2 unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons). Leaving out the possibility of some of the unvaccinated children wearing masks (this is complicated enough already), as an unmasked (or masked) fully vaccinated person at the store, the chance of the unmasked person next to you being unvaccinated is 74% (which is 37 out of 50). As a fully vaccinated person, against those odds, I’m keeping the mask on for now. If you are unvaccinated and have been convinced to ignore basic science amd the germ theory of disease well into the 21st century, all I can say is you and most of the unmasked people around you are playing roulette with your health & your friends’ and family’s."
2021-06-30 21:14:21,"After spending four days and nights with me over Memorial Day my 8-year-old granddaughter began to show signs of COVID (including no sense of taste or smell) and the next day she tested positive.  Turns out her best friend at school had tested positive the Friday before.  It was my first known exposure to COVID.

I'm vaccinated (Pfizer) and since I'd already been exposed for four days I volunteered to have her quarantine with me.  I tested negative twice in the next 7 days and had no symptoms despite the fact that I found it nearly impossible to keep an 8-year-old from inadvertently spreading germs.  She was still coughing but felt better after a week and the doctor cleared her to return to school after 10 days, at which time she no longer had a cough and her sense of taste and smell had fully returned.  

I don't know which variant she had or how worried I should have been, but it wasn't until after another week passed that I felt confident the vaccine had definitely protected me in a way masks and hand sanitizer never could."
2021-06-30 21:16:43,"If someone got the J&J vaccine and is in a region with a spike in the Delta variant, would there be any significant downside to getting a full dose (two shots) of Pfizer/Moderna as well?"
2021-06-30 21:27:15,"I recently tested positive on at at-home kit even though I have been fully vaccinated (Moderna) since early May. My symptoms were not severe enough to go to the doctor, but after three days of a constant headache, I decided to order a test kit.

Has anyone else had a breakthrough infection? My symptoms: an excruciating headache for about 72 hours that required constant ibuprofen, muscle cramps, and general malaise. No cough, no chest pain, no loss of sense of taste or smell. 

How did I catch COVID? Had to be from running inside small stores without a mask on. I haven’t been in large crowds, haven’t grocery shopped in person, haven’t been on a plane, haven’t had my hair/nails done, eaten in sit-down restaurants or gone to the movie theater. I’ve been staying close to home, only shopping locally, not staying in any one store for longer than 10 minutes, mainly because the vaccination rate is so low in my area. I was hesitant to go without a mask, but did anyway, trusting the vaccine to do its job. When they say that the new variant is more transmissible, they aren’t playing. What have I learned? That masks do make a difference and that the vaccines are preventing severe disease. Please get vaccinated."

Sorry. I complied for a year, got vaccinated as soon as I could and now am being asked to mask up for those can’t be bothered to go to CVS and get a free vaccine. Nope. If they get the virus it’s the consequences of their own decision. Children under 12 are a different story of course. If this new variant seems to affect children , I’ll have to rethink this. Ironically the unvaccinated are walking around without masks anyway."
2021-06-30 21:51:22,"Has anyone ever questioned anything they are told/ Does everyone just take things at face value because someone that is in their opinion a person of authority said so? Authority does not equal integrity. We have seen many a virus many a disease come and go. We have vaccinations for so many of them now, yet not one time have I ever seen a virus have so many faces. This one is so unique that it serves a political agenda. Variant ? Hmmmm why have the 1000's of viruses we have seen in our lifetime ever had the ability to morph , mutate and restrict peoples freedom, as well as destroy an economy as this one. I have always been taught to question everything and i do , i research I have a degree in Biochemistry and have never heard of our bodies gaining immunity and then losing it as they say with this. it is no more deadly than the flu yet when we start to question and fight to regain freedom VIOLA' a variant. Doubtful, unconvinced and very disappointed in my fellow man for not researching, for blindly believing what they are told, by a man that was already caught in lie after lie. Why ??"
2021-06-30 22:01:39,"Those who refuse vaccination in the U.S. are running around infecting each other. For this reason, and this reason only, we vaccinated are being 'encouraged' or even required to mask in order to model good behavior.

I have had more than enough of this paradigm. The fully vaccinated have done their job, met their responsibility. It is time to let us free.

Pre-pandemic, there were unfortunate immunocompromised souls. They had to self-isolate and mask in public per doctors orders. Did we mask in order to protect them? No, of course not.
Pre-pandemic, we had anti-vaxxers refusing to vaccinate their kids against measles. When the eventual measles outbreaks arrived, did we the vaccinated mask to protect them. No.

We are facing a deadly pandemic. The government provides highly effective vaccines free of charge to one and all. If some people refuse vaccination, let them carry the risk. If they get infected and die, whose fault is that?

Not mine."

I'd rather be somewhere where there's relatively good vaccination rates and a recommendation to wear a mask albeit by the WHO which has its issues."
2021-06-30 22:13:05,"""Right now there are enough people unvaccinated that we should be modeling good behavior, showing social solidarity.”

Using this logic, we will be wearing masks forever.  By now, anyone who wants to be vaccinated has already been vaccinated.  At this point I am done with showing social solidarity with people who are refusing to protect their own health."

I am one of the unfortunate who have been told that medically I should not receive the vaccine.  I live with my husband (Pfizer) and college-age son (J &J)  My question is - how long can Covid stay in the air inside a home?? Meaning IF my vaccinated housemates were to get Covid in a breakthrough case -( you have addressed the rarity of this, but still...)  - could I get it just walking into the kitchen after they have left?   Should I wear a mask all the time in my home?   We do keep windows  open and we all have separate bathrooms.   Thoughts for how long Covid can remain in the air??"

2021-06-30 21:09:56,"Hi, Tara, there has been a lot of push back from vaccine experts against the CDC's insistence that the J&J vaccine is going to protect against the delta.

One push back is that people got the vaccine reluctantly, but willing to do their 'patriotic duty' to get the first shot available.

Now, the CDC is willing to let the J&J recipients be a second-class group, not nearly as well protected.

For example, among many 
<a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25"" target=""_blank"">https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25</a>/

Can the NYT address this?

Apparently , virologists, who have connections the average person does not, have been able to get a booster shot and they have publicly stated so.

Canada is asking people who got the J&J vaccine to get the mRNA vaccine, seeing them as otherwise unprotected.

If nothing else, the J&J recipients are not protected against getting and spreading the disease."
2021-06-30 18:22:20,"Why does every picture of people wearing masks feature someone wearing a mask incorrectly? Is this an editorial policy, to disrupt people’s understanding of how to wear a mask correctly? Ugh."

As someone who had a “mild” case that lasted 8-12 months and was debilitating, you don’t want to get this or give it to anyone."
2021-06-30 18:42:49,"Is there not enough space in the NYT for articles about the Covid-19 vaccines to not just write about the ""Pfizer"" vaccine, instead of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

After all, the little German firm BioNTech - founded by a married couple of doctors of Turkish origin with only about 50 employees -did develop one of the vaccines with the highest efficacy.  This is again proof that immigrants are indeed a plus to other nations.

BioNTech didn't get a penny from the US, but about half a million from the German government, while the giant Pfizer was able to manufacture the vaccine in its stateside plants and abroad."
2021-06-30 19:01:00,"There is no way I am going inside a public indoor place without a mask, and I am fully vaccinated. There is so little we know about delta...it makes me worry. Phizer makes us 88% protected from delta...still we can be carriers to those who are not vaccinated, like pregnats women, and kids. and I dont want to get it either, becasue I also live with unvaccinated folks."
2021-06-30 19:22:43,"The biggest confusion about masking is that according to the CDC early in the pandemic, the protection they offer to the mask wearer is limited - the point is to protect others FROM the wearer if he or she is infected. Even though this paper reported that fact as it was first being addressed, this article is a perfect example of how half the references to masks, by the writer or her sources, equate the value as being both to the wearer and the rest of the public.

We very much need better reporting about exactly how and why masks work, because understanding the actual physics of the transmission would help clear this up. The main point of the article still stands, but the CDC's recent guidance was that if you have been vaccinated, the danger of you transmitting to OTHERS is very very low. They won't make much difference if you're worried about contracting the virus from someone else."
2021-06-30 19:23:25,"Can someone make senses of this? …”As of that date, the C.D.C. reported that 4,115 patients had Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough infections, including 3,907 who had been hospitalized and 750 who had died.” Does it mean that of the 3,907 people who were hospitalized 750 of them died? Even if those numbers are correct, doesn’t the hospitalization rate (3,907 out of 4,115) seem very high as compared to what the story indicates, and isn’t the fatality rate kind of high (750 out of 3,907 hospitalized and out of 4,115 sickened)? In any case, these number seem to say if you’re a breakthrough exception you’re in trouble?"
2021-06-30 20:52:28,"Maybe I missed it in the article, most news program and articles mention that Delta variant is spreading fast but no one mentions the hospitalization rate or deaths.

Recent news, which the NYT would do well to cover and report. Is that vaccine safety studies for the under-12 set — our literal future — won’t be unblinded until the winter.

I understand the need to make vaccination appealing or rewarding to the hesitant or resistant, since they don’t seem to think continued good health or life is its own, good enough reward and incentive.  What I’ll thank the CDC and antivaxers to do, however, is to place convenience or vanity or adults’ stubbornness above the health and welfare of our youngest kids."
2021-06-30 19:56:30,"I really wish writers would be more specific when they write sentences like this one “Studies show that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine offer 88 percent protection against the Delta variant, compared to 93 percent protection against Alpha.” The “protection” referred to here is the risk of a vaccinated person becoming infected. Many people mistakenly believe it’s an 88 to 93 percent reduction in the risk of serious illness or death."

I’m starting to really hate this country nobody cares at all about anyone else."
2021-06-30 20:09:38,"Our news media kept telling us that breakthrough infections are rare.  That depends on what is the definition of rare?  

NY Times published several days ago that more than 10,000 breakthrough infections occurred till April this year.  Due to vaccines do decrease hospitalization and death rates, CDC stopped counting the breakthrough cases.  What a loss for us to know the truth of breakthrough.

Delta Variant will be the dominate virous in the coming weeks.  It already did terrible damages to UK that London was lockdown for 2 weeks.  Similar lockdowns are happening in Europe.  We haven't reached the 70% inoculation rate.  CDC should warn us about the danger not wearing masks in public places.  Never underestimate the Delta Variant.  Trump did it the first time.

Deactivation of the virulence of the variant by tweaking the available vaccines could done only  when x -number of the infected proved that the variant has reached the state of 'variant of concern' from 'variant of interest"".
This calls for the continuation of wearing masks.

Why don't we say,""Vaccination becomes a strong defender against infection provided if we continue with wearing masks.' or
""Impregnate the vaccine efficacy by wearing masks to save you from infection""."
2021-07-01 01:44:38,This article has no mention of the immunocompromised- where vaccination may not provide protection. Herd immunity is needed to protect these folks- mostly ignored by the CDC despite John Hopkins and others urging the CDC to provide better guidance.

Also, if the vaccinated get only mild cases of COVID-19, do we need to wear masks for our sakes? So it sounds as if the unvaccinated are getting and spreading covid, especially amongst themselves.  What I'm hearing is a case against mask mandates."

Add that word to your own situation: age; health status; exposure to the unvaccinated and suspected unvaccinated; exposure to crowds indoors and out; travel; your own vaccination status and the latest information about variants.  For me, that means still avoiding: gyms; bars; indoor dining; indoor movies; airplanes and immature relatives."

This does not make any sense. 

The risk of being hospitalized or dying from a breakthrough infection is 4,115 divided by the number of vaccinated people who have been exposed to the virus, which is unknowable but clearly well under 150M."
2021-07-01 14:33:50,"Completely ignores the 10 million or so immunocompromised people in the country. CDC ignores them as well, saying they should ask their doctor. Right. Even though testing has shown that about 50% of immunocompromised patients have no response at all even when fully vaccinated.

People with donated organs, those with autoimmune diseases, those with cancer..... all these people are going to be deficient in antibodies or have none at all.

While risks go down for anyone who’s vaccinated, they remain substantial at advanced age nonetheless.

I’d be concerned about diminishing protection if too many Americans don’t get their shots. This was an issue even with the original virus. The WHO advice must account for a global mix of vaccines and situations, places like Mongolia with large epidemics despite high immunization rates. But any vaccine beats chancing it “naked.”

As in England, most new cases in Utah are the B.1.617.2 strain, and numbers in the hospital are close to double what they were a month ago. 10% of Covid our tests come back positive.

As a scientist (72 years old) and a good citizen, I got vaccinated as soon as I could.  Why should I mask up to protect those that have made a ""personal choice"" not to vaccinate?

The people who are not vaccinated are also not big on wearing masks, so there is no real need to show solidarity. So the question is - is there a benefit or a reason why the vaccinated person should mask-up in the above situation?

I know there is limited data on this but has there been any further guidance regarding vaccinations for pregnant women? I was very eager to get the vaccine before I found out I was pregnant. Every OB I ask in my practice gives me a different answer that ends with ""it's a personal decision"" and no one has definitively said to get the vaccine. I'm now 25 weeks pregnant and very anxious about the Delta variant and the fact that most people are not wearing masks in public. I also have a 4 year old that goes to camp for 3 hours a day where they take temperatures and wear masks. Is there any reason for me to hold off on getting the vaccine?"
2021-07-02 04:07:29,"I’m fully vaccinated since March. I continue to wear a mask when in public spaces. It’s not as if we can tell who is, or who is not vaccinated.

My husband and I are in our mid-70s with several pre-existing conditions, and don't want to add Long COVID to our list.

2021-07-02 12:53:43,"The Pfizer vaccine seems to be the most effective vaccine of the many out there, but it's not 100%.

With both doses, it is 88% effective against the Delta variant, which sounds pretty good.  

But put a different way, if eight fully vaccinated people are exposed to the more contagious and deadly Delta variant, one of them will get sick and possibly die.  Imagine a room full of 8 people you know and like.  It doesn't seem like such good odds anymore, does it?

I received both doses of Pfizer.  I also live in a state full of vaccine resisters yet we have opened back up as if the pandemic is over.  We are now spiking but no restrictions have been put in place.  

I will continue masking and distancing.  It's just foolish to stop now.  It is criminal that any public official would treat preventative measures that protect public health with scorn or make them illegal."

2021-07-02 13:38:06,"I've made lots of comments throughout this very good sharing space, well supported by the regular presence of ""Well"" editor Tara Parker-Pope. Time to compose my own original posts!

The two critical decisions people have been asked to make during this pandemic have been about wearing face coverings (mostly masks), and getting vaccinated.  Oddly, masking has been for the most part mandatory, at least on paper, while jabs have been entirely voluntary.  This has been true globally, not just in the USA.  Employer mandates for vaccination are beginning to emerge, though fitfully, while mask mandates are clearly in retreat.

Before the vaccines began arriving in bulk in January 2021, masks were perceived as the first, best line of defence. ""Masks Save Lives"" billboards shouted the message, and there were stories like the one about the St. Louis salon where no masked customers caught COVID from two sick but masked stylists. Solid research about the degree to which masks have actually worked to cut COVID-19 transmission has remained sorely lacking.  Diversion of N95 masks to health professionals left even greater doubt about the value of the lower-quality masks that remained. Handwashing, sanitizing, distancing and lockdowns may together have had more impact. Masks have great potential, but they have lacked any concerted support from governments and scientists.  Given the repeated calls for people to mask up, right down to the current delta variant, this seems to be another oddity."
2021-07-02 13:52:38,I am most definitely not wearing a mask for anyone's feelings or to show solidarity or to help a business show they take covid seriously.  I am vaccinated in an area with a high vaccination rate. I am done.
2021-07-02 14:23:27,"“Like dressing for the weather” but does anyone expect any governor (or mayor, or President) to want to be the one to deliver the bad news of a not so great Covid “weather report” at this point?  And if masks do make a difference in spreading the Delta variant, doesn’t it make sense to start wearing masks now, to help prevent “bad weather”?  But is mask wearing effective to help prevent the spread of the Delta variant without a mandate?

Take Newsom in California.  He’s facing a recall election in September and his political survival is dependent on California being fully open for business.  How can you trust Newsom to make the politically difficult decision to reinstate a mask mandate between now and September 14th, even if it is absolutely the right thing to do for public welfare?"
2021-07-02 16:04:32,"I'm not sure if it is unclear wording or fuzzy math on the risk of hospitalization or death from breakthrough cases.   Serious cases seem to have been about 1 in 10 of breakthrough cases.  Those serious cases are the 4K out of 150M. Also the breakthrough percent has risen in the June numbers over the April numbers, as should be expected now that vaccinations are slowing down.   Reporting cases per month or week would be more clear.   Maybe with a graph like they do for total cases."
2021-07-02 18:07:17,"I am wearing a mask as an older adult with a set of chronic conditions until one big group of vulnerable people are fully vaccinated--children under 12. I do not want to get or spread COVID-19/21-Delta  from or to them. Just because children are not prone to death or hospitalizations, doesn't mean they cannot get ill and disabled. And the ""mild cases"" I have witnessed in older adults with their long term neurological disabilities are not worth the risk to me either."
2021-07-02 19:26:20,"I have concluded that the wisest thing to do is to continue to mask up in places where I encounter strangers, stores, restaurants, doctors' offices, etc.  When we move from the current 40% fully vaccinated in my area to at least 60%, I will reconsider. Meanwhile, I will not hold my breath, because a large number of people have no compunction about running around unmasked as well as unvaccinated, including the millions of tourists who visit this area annually."
2021-07-02 20:31:03,"Oregon is approaching a 70% vaccination rate and fully opened on June 30th.  It's the other 30% that I find problematic, especially as so many can't be bothered to put on a mask.

When I was shopping this morning, the stores were busy and only a handful of people were masked (myself included).  I fear that the country is on the verge of an unpleasant surprise with the delta variant.

When the pandemic is really over, I think we should take our masks and make a NAMES project memorial quilt with them, as we did for AIDS, and put it in a National COVID Memorial.

We can't afford to forget how fundamentally COVID has altered our lives."
2021-07-02 21:10:47,"So if you have had a COVID infection then get vaccinated, the data is saying that the immunity is stronger than just vaccination or just prior infection.  Has any data been collected on vaccinated people who have had a breakthrough infection?  Does this also create stronger immunity?"
2021-07-02 21:48:34,"The point that is being missed is that vaccines reduce the risk of severe illness and death, even for a vaccinated person amongst a higher concentration of unvaccinated people, by nearly 2 orders of magnitude.  This makes the death risk from covid much less than the risk of dying in a car accident (as a driver, passenger or pedestrian), the risk for which is about 1/114 over the course of an average lifespan; Influenza's death risk about the same. We don't see people calling for the end of driving or making people wear face coverings forever to combat the flu.

But clinicians and clinical researchers have risen a bit beyond the attention they are due to push for goal as far to the diminishing-returns end of the curve as they can sell to people. This is not rational or reasonable public health advocacy or policy.

Humans, even the most educated ones,  still cannot dust off emotional momentum for the reality the emerge from the dry analysis of facts. Some people aren't going to live an average lifespan no matter what you do, but you can dramatically reduce the quality of life for those that continue living. There is a balance, but the clinical voices in this articles are not proffering a reasonable balance."
2021-07-03 00:10:32,"I'm fully vaccinated, and for that reason I choose not to wear a mask when it's not required. Sure, I could be asymptomatically infected with Delta, but the odds are so low it's not worth the hassle to protect those who, at least where I live, are now choosing not to be vaccinated rather than can't be vaccinated.

At some point we're going to have to accept that covid isn't going away and that we'll likely need boosters in the future, just as we need annual flu vaccines. In the meantime, we can stop letting fear and believers of conspiracy theories hold our lives hostage."
2021-07-03 01:24:31,"It's wonderful that new studies are showing the vaccines do work well even against the new variants. Still, it is worth noting that every step the science is taking is new, unprecedentedly new. Lots of unknowns are still accompanying every step forward. Mask is a tiny price to pay to keep everyone safer, so why is it still an issue with so many people?"
2021-07-03 01:35:25,"This advice is fine for those that are vaccinated, but what about people with mixed status households, like those of us with kids who are not vaccinated?"
2021-07-03 03:50:02,"I was just in a bar in Sea Isle City, NJ (the Jersey Shore).  On the crowded dance floor my stepson and his wife chose to wear masks (we are all vaccinated).  They were ridiculed and insulted by several people.  We were in front of the band with a lot of 20 somethings (a population with low vaccination rates).  My stepson was irate about the ridicule and thought he was not only protecting himself and those probable unvaccinated in his vicinity but also was making a statement of he should be free to wear a mask without judgment.   I agree with him and am sorrowed by the divisions in this community of Americans.   How unfortunate."
2021-07-03 10:48:23,"Dr. Walensky seems to be gifted at saying exactly the wrong thing, each time she speaks.

She should never have encouraged vaccinated people to feel safe about unmasking in the company of unvaccinated people. There is a virtually impossible-to-assess level of risk. 

Having no ability to offer helpful advice, she should have remained mute.  Instead, she triggered a stampede."
2021-07-03 11:24:26,"I will only wear a mask when there is a likelihood than children under 12 or an adult who cannot get the vaccine for purely medical reasons may be present. Otherwise, at this point, I feel no responsibility to the unvaccinated adults who choose not to take care of themselves or their communities."
2021-07-03 11:45:52,"Infection rates here in the UK are increasing rapidly with the predominance of the Delta variant, although hospitalization and deaths are thankfully remaining relatively low - it looks like the much maligned Astra-zeneca vax is currently coping well. The Petri dish test will start on the 19th July when Boris Johnson is scheduled to relax most of the current pandemic restrictions."
2021-07-03 11:54:29,I am around children and have adult friends who cannot get vaccinated at this time.  I had the virus and I am vaccinated.  I do wear a mask in public.  I am an ICU-RN and the mask is an extra safety precaution and a sign of solidarity with my friends.  One terrific side effect is far fewer allergy symptoms!  Maybe because I am a nurse I don't find it restrictive.
2021-07-03 12:02:59,My husband and I are among those who developed Covid several months after being fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. He is 73 and I'm 68 and we're both in good health. We had what we thought were bad head colds.  He recovered in about three days whereas my symptoms lasted about a week. I became suspicious when two days into my illness I lost my sense of smell and got tested. We have been very careful to mask up in public but we live in an area where vaccination rates are very low. I say all of this to stress that these vaccines work as I believe they kept both of us from getting very sick and it remains important to keep the masks on especially in areas where vaccination rates are low.
2021-07-03 12:31:45,I’m vaccinated but still wear a double mask indoors in public because I’m hoping it will help reduce the small probability that I would fall victim to a breakthrough infection. I also recognize that most of the people who (irrationally) resisted wearing a mask are also likely to refuse to be vaccinated. I’m trying to protect myself at this point.
2021-07-03 12:49:58,"The most definitive study on the impact of masks on acquiring covid was done last year in Denmark.

Unlike most previous studies that relied on computer models or lab simulations, this was a real clinical study with over 3,000 participants and a control group.

Half the participants spent at least three hours a day in normal activity outside their home and wore masks. The other half did the same without masks.

At the end of the study the difference between the masked and unmasked groups as far as risks for the virus was concerned was ""statistically insignificant.""

Some argue that this data therefore justifies mask policies as a ""just to be safe measure.""

But more recent studies have shown that wearing masks for any extended period of time carries significant risks of bacterial infection, including bacterial pneumonia.

The science tells us that there is little or no benefit from requiring masks and significant risks of various diseases from wearing them.

If any business is still worried all they have to do is inform customers that they may or may not choose to wear a mask.

 But with either choice the person assumes responsibility for their health and waves any potential liability by the company.

This is the science and while we should have science dictate policy, we have seen over the last year where that frequently doesn't happen.

Here there is no excuse. The science on risks and benefits is solid and clearly favors a no mask policy."
2021-07-03 13:13:13,"We are both vaccinated.  We have two one year old   granddaughters.  We still wear masks when we are in a grocery store or someplace like Home Depot, basically any retail store.  We do it for our grandchildren.  We do not know if we can pass it to them or if they can get it and that is the point....we will not take the chance.  It is not worth it and carrying a mask around with you is no big deal."
2021-07-03 13:13:48,The unvaccinated should wear masks. Period. When I see someone with a mask I see an unvaccinated person or someone suffering mentally from the after affects of the pandemic. Especially if they pair the mask with gloves. Wearing a mask at this point to protect others is ludicrous and goes against the science. Follow the CDC guidelines.
2021-07-03 13:29:22,"The Delta variant will have a devastating impact in those areas with low vaccination rates.  

According to the BBC, ""The latest Public Health England (PHE) figures show there were 92,029 confirmed Delta cases between 1 February and 22 June, most of which were identified in June.  Of these, 58% were in completely unvaccinated people and only 8% were fully vaccinated."" They went on to say, ""No vaccine is perfect in preventing people from getting Covid and therefore a small number of people will still die...In a world where every single person had been vaccinated, 100% of Covid deaths would be of vaccinated people."" 

I thought this brought a lot of perspective to the conversation. Please wear a mask and stop the rush to bring your employees back into the office until they can prove they are fully vaccinated."
2021-07-03 13:31:21,"Let me see if I have this right. I am fully vaccinated and because I care about public health, I should wear a mask to protect those who refuse to get vaccinated or wear masks because they value their “freedom” over the health of others and sincerely believe that COVID is a hoax despite 600K Americans having died from the disease. So we are supposed to be protecting them, while they don’t care about us or themselves or their loved ones  for that matter? I can only wonder what they would do for me if the situation were reversed..."
2021-07-03 13:50:03,Please report on the risk to young children of the Delta variant and what adults interacting with them should be doing to protect them! Should the adults be wearing masks in public to protect themselves from low risk of break through infections which could be passed onto unvaccinated kids? Should young kids still always be masked in public? Outside and inside? These are the questions worrying parents and grandparents!
2021-07-03 14:15:18,The bottom line here is : who do you trust? What assumption can you make about total strangers? The way I see it trust is in short supply these days for good reason. Full vaccination and mask wearing are a very small price to pay for personal safety and can serve as an indication that the mask wearer feels a certain obligation to society.
2021-07-03 14:38:25,"We are all not safe until everyone is vaccinated so that no more variants crop up. To that end USA should help other countries with achieving their vaccination goals. Last week India vaccinated 8 million people in a single day, the highest number to date."
2021-07-03 14:45:33,Children and the immunocompromised are being forgotten in this discussion.
2021-07-03 15:14:42,"I feel for anyone who has young children with underlying issues, or people who truly can get the vaccine, but I don't feel like it's on me to wear a mask to protect the unvaccinated. I probably will, but at what point are the unvaccinated responsible for their decisions."
2021-07-03 15:33:40,"I am very confused and concerned.  I will be having my 75th birthday soon and wanted to have a family reunion.  A third of the people invited refuse to be vaccinated.  I am immune compromised and vaccinated.  The numbers quoted of people who were vaccinated and were hospitalized from the infection after having been vaccinated does not mention how many of those were immune compromised to begin with.  I would be willing to bet that the percentage was higher than the general population.  It also doesn't address the long term Covid complications that a person with a mild case can suffer.  I wish there was more information to guide me.  Since this will be an eating and indoor party, I am seriously considering canceling it knowing I may never see these beloved family members again.  How sad!"
2021-07-03 16:34:55,"""Mask mandates are largely intended to protect the unvaccinated""...No, the major purpose of the mask is to prevent someone who unknowingly has the virus from spreading it to people who might be more vulnerable."
2021-07-03 17:04:39,"Children are at extremely low risk of covid, and cases of pediatric “long covid” as well as hospitalization have been dramatically overestimated. Read the research, folks. 

We are at a point now where the vulnerable (the elderly) can protect themselves with vaccines. Risk is individual now, not collective as it was a year ago. Cases have become decoupled from hospitalizations and deaths, meaning the only source of alarm moving forward should be when deaths and hospitalizations rise— not cases.

A growing chorus of voices in public health and medicine are saying there’s no more reason to subject kids, or anyone else, to restrictions. I agree."
2021-07-03 19:29:35,"Why has the CDC not released specific data on which vaccines are responsible for the majority of breakthrough infections in the fully vaccinated? The reports seem to give collective breakthrough results and say they are rare with all 3 vaccines. However, I suspect there is a disproportionate number from J and J and some of the reports of efficacy seems to be only on m RNA vaccines. The CDC risks losing all credibility with the public if it is found to be down playing the lack of efficacy of one vaccine over another. It would be in the best interest of public health safety to alert health care providers and offer us options to get booster shots to those vaccinated people who might still be at significant risk of breakthrough infections.I saw packed restaurants and bars in Martha’s Vineyard this week and nobody was wearing masks. Hopefully they were all vaccinated but I doubt it and expect a surge in infections in the coming weeks if the vaccinated are not truly protected"
2021-07-03 21:04:46,"The infectiousness of the Delta version of COVID-19 makes life dangerous for children too young to be vaccinated. 

While it remains unlikely that children will get a fatal infection, there is little reason to expect they can avoid long-COVID. This puts a sizable minority of the population at risk for what is too often a lifetime disability. 

For this reason and because those adults who refuse vaccines are the same people who refuse to wear masks, our children are still effectively prisoners as are those who are immune compromized. 

Those who are unvaccinated should be prevented from going unmasked anywhere a child or immunocompromised person might be present."
2021-07-03 21:17:39,"If I understand it correctly an N95 mask protect the wearer from catching the virus but wearing other masks, such as a surgical mask or the usual blue color masks that we normally see, protects the wearer from infecting others by blocking the droplets from spreading.

If that is true the word ""mask"" as used in media reports is a bit confusing. I thought the CDC recommendation of mask wearing is referred to surgical masks and not N95 masks. So how is it that fully vaccinated people should still wear masks in public is puzzling to me since fully vaccinated people are said not be be asymmetric. So whom are they trying to protect by wearing masks?"
2021-07-03 21:35:14,"It’s funny how many point to the “research” on COVID and all its long term and short term effects. COVID, as a pandemic human infection has been around for what, 30 months or so? In my opinion 30 months (with the majority of this time being without a vaccine) is not enough to test any therapy or vaccine in terms of long term effectiveness. Corona viruses mutate, as do viruses causing flu and colds (like rhinoviruses): corona viruses are not “stable” like polio or smallpox viruses though durable (lifelong) immunity may not be achieved even with these and booster shots are recommended for several childhood viruses. 

Get vaccinated! But I think we need to understand we are the test subjects. We will answer the questions of durable immunity, and the ability of these vaccines to thwart the variations to come. I am skeptical when companies say their vaccines are effective against variants. And I still wear a mask in large stores, on the bus, and keep away from close contact from others I do not know well. I say trust your vaccine to provide protection, keep yourself safe by reasonably adhering to the “old” advice and verify your vaccine’s effectiveness over the long term."
2021-07-03 22:21:03,Why not use common sense and wear masks for the foreseeable future?  Problem solved.
2021-07-04 00:06:28,"The CDC really needs to compile mild to moderate breakthrough cases so we can get a better picture of what's happening.  My wife and I were part of a 12 person fully vaccinated group that went to a Mexican all-inclusive resort for a week.  On day 6, I tested positive and had to quarantine for 2 weeks, my wife was OK but had a fever after she got home (didn't quarantine with me) and later tested positive and another of our group, 1/2 our age and very fit also tested positive and had a mild case just a couple of days after getting home.  Our pretty randomized group somewhat challenges the ""very rare"" on breakthrough cases.
Also, if a person who had Covid get vaccinated, their immunity is supposed to be very high.  What about the opposite?  What happens to the breakthrough case's immunity levels?"
2021-07-04 01:01:08,"The additional concern about the Delta variant is that kids younger than 12 can’t be vaccinated, so if you have any unvaccinated kids in your life, even if you’re vaccinated and catch the virus but are asymptomatic, you could pass it on to them. 

In another article, I read the Delta variant is more likely to affect children, so even though I’m vaccinated, I haven’t been doing indoor dining or anything indoors massless in public spaces because I regularly see my little nephews."
2021-07-03 12:08:43,"I live in an area with low ish vaccination rates that are unlikely to improve.  Ignorant anti vaxxers literally have a doctor on our board of health.  As a fully vaxxed person, I thinks its time to say the truth out loud.  The risk has shifted to the risk takers.  Kids will get shots soon enough and the immuno compromised have to take no more precautions than they do to survive anyway.   

The risk has shifted to the risk takers.  Finally."
2021-07-03 22:53:01,"What if CoVid has happened before! What if it had been in a state of dormancy... in China, until someone was sifting through dirt, and it's airborne.  Originally many people were killed but the contagion limited... they didn't have air travel.  Explains not being able to find origins. If was far enough back in time, the actual species CoVid originally passed through might actually be extinct.

This same scenario has been suggested about HIV.  People unearthed old bones during a dig and released the virus.

This does lay bare some questions about what are we about to face with global warming exposing million year old virus."
2021-07-04 13:57:50,With the variants just get used to wearing a mask in curtain situations just like you wear clothes. And do not be surprised is an annual COVID shot is as common as a flu shot.

2021-07-04 02:48:44,"This whole mask drama is ridiculous and the CDC has only made the situation worse their ""honor"" system that I suspect was made for political and economic reasons rather than scientific ones. No one really knows what the outcome of variants will be. If I'm in a shop I assume that the people not wearing masks are the ones less likely to be vaccinated since they are probably those who were virus deniers all along. A friend who was wearing a mask in a convenience store recently was screamed at by someone who wasn't. What is so hard about wearing a mask when you are around people whose vaccination status you don't know? I'm fully vaccinated and don't mask when I'm with friends who I know are as well, but when I go into a shop where I'm surrounded by people whose status I don't know and may not be wearing a mask, I mask up. I also have a cousin undergoing chemotherapy who cannot be vaccinated now. So can we stop acting like idiots and just be a little considerate of one another?"
2021-07-03 21:56:00,"If someone doesn't mention respirators in their health advice, I'm not interested. It's an airborne virus. Why is it so hard to understand?"
2021-07-05 10:30:51,"Using the generic word ""mask"" is insufficient. Most masks don't protect the wearer, except perhaps from a person breathing very close to them. They mainly protect others from you. To protect yourself from airborne virus, i.e. virus remaining suspended 1-2 hours indoors after having been exhaled by a Covid patient, you need to wear an N95 mask, or perhaps the slightly inferior KN95."
2021-07-05 11:58:46,"The Doors were right, ""People are strange.""

I'd venture to say that before this pandemic, most people were not familiar with the Spanish flu that happened a century ago. Of course, back then, they didn't have fancy DNA sequencing to produce a vaccine in a year. If you're rational, you would think that if that ever happened again, everybody who had a vaccine available to them would get vaccinated.

Now that an equivalent pandemic has happened, we can see that a large portion of our fellow earthlings are not rational. The whole politicization of health in the US, mostly a consequence of the previous WH occupant's bizarre response to it, has caused a 21st century success story to become a lot less so. When an individual's ""freedom"" disregards the health of others (as well as themselves), the line has been crossed. It is these people who cause all of us to live under the threat of a new variant coming along that will require a new round of vaccinations to be necessary.

As a rational person, I can't understand the total disregard for real world consequences to themselves and others. Then again, if everyone was rational, we wouldn't have such huge income disparities, steps to reduce climate change would be tested and introduced broadly, and education of things such as evolution wouldn't be undermined.

Unfortunately, a large percentage of people are not rational....they are strange."
2021-07-05 14:14:27,"Frankly, don't think ""the science"" is all in by some good stretch yet, and it's still best to make mistakes on the side of prudence."
2021-07-05 15:26:36,"""This is about promoting a social norm: Right now there are enough people unvaccinated that we should be modeling good behavior, showing social solidarity.""
It is not the vaccinated going around unmasked that are not showing social solidarity, it is the unvaccinated. We, the fully vaccinated, have done our part. 
I fully sympathize with the immunocompromised and those who cannot be vaccinated for legitimate reasons but they have the option to mask up. It is not me that is putting them at risk. 
It is true that you can't tell who is vaccinated and who isn't. As much as I hate the idea, perhaps it is time to consider vaccine passports and excluding the recalcitrant from certain activities. Even if it doesn't spur them to get vaccinated it will at least isolate them in a way to prevent them from doing harm."
2021-07-05 15:51:45,"The 88% level of protection afforded by the Pfizer vaccine versus the dreaded Delta variant is fortunately quite significant.  However, a 12% percent chance of contracting the Delta variant is sufficient reason for cautious folks to resume wearing a mask in public in spite of current CDC guidance."
2021-07-05 18:44:54,"None of our children under 12 are vaccinated.  

For this reason alone, the CDC was irresponsible in its unenforceable rule of allowing vaccinated people to discard masks, providing cover for the many irresponsible unvaccinated adults in America who are more than willing to go unmasked and risk the lives of others."
2021-07-06 03:38:47,"@Tara Pope Your statement that ""studies show that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine offer 88 percent protection against the Delta variant, compared to 93 percent protection against Alpha,"" is a bit unclear.  Is this referring to any infection, symptomatic infection, or serious cases and hospitalizations?
More significantly, as the Delta variant spreads, more data is becoming available.  Data just released by Israel's Health Ministry shows that ""Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 has dropped by some 30 percent to 64%, given the spread of the Delta variant. The data shows that during May, when the strain was less prevalent, the vaccine was 94.3% effective.""

2021-07-06 10:18:04,"How can the CDC or the NYT claim that asymptomatic breakthrough infections are extremely rare, and will continue to be rare with Delta variant, when (1) the CDC stopped tracking breakthrough cases (unless the person was hospitalized)  at the end of April and (2), most vaccinated people will never be tested? 

Delta apparently causes symptoms which mimic that of a bad head cold.  We know that unvaccinated people without antibodies transmit Covid; but it’s still not clear whether vaccinated people do. All I see are phrases like “scientists don’t believe” or “it’s unlikely that,” but no data. You see reports out of Israel and Europe which provide a lot more information than what we have here in the states, where there is ongoing confusion and a lack of transparency.

Also, it would be nice to see the source and methodology for the 88% Pfizer figure. I just read an article about a study in Scotland that found Pfizer to be 79% effective against Delta.

79% is very good, but it’s not 88%.


In either case. Mask requirements in indoor, public spaces help to protect the immunosuppressed (whether vaccinated or not) small children, and others who are not or cannot be vaccinated. Its not enough for those individuals to wear one. Hopefully, the mandates will remain in place for subways, buses, medical facilities and air travel."
2021-07-06 12:32:02,"I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccination in April 2021, and I still wear my mask.  I feel safe and comfortable doing so.

2021-07-06 12:33:04,"Although the COVID-19 vaccines have shown to be highly effective against the virus, they are simply an added layer of protection against severe illness until herd immunity is attained, which is not the case as of now. Mask mandates should not be lifted as their is insufficient data collected on the efficacy of vaccines against the new variants that have emerged and will likely continue to emerge. The Delta variants have further displayed high prevalence for breakthrough infections due to having higher transmissibility and severity of symptoms, wherein fully vaccinated individuals have been hospitalised or even died. This further brings us to question whether the vaccines protect us from the long term side effects of the virus that many seem to suffer even if one contracts it and displays mild symptoms. Vaccinated individuals are still potential vectors of the virus, which further puts vulnerable individuals at risk, who are unable to get vaccinated due to their medical conditions. With the added confusion, as a result of conflicting opinions, regarding mask usage, we may as well continue wearing masks as we are better off safe than sorry, until the health organizations appear to reach a consensus. Everyone is keen on returning to the sense of normalcy after the past year, which is understandable; however, this may only be prolonged if we follow the premature relaxations on wearing masks as we do not know what's in store for us with the continually changing circumstances."
2021-07-06 18:33:48,"Here I am in New York, vaccinated, along with everyone I know. I go outside without a mask, but I always have one in my pocket in case I have to go into a store, or take a bus.

I will be going to work one day a week, and probably wearing a mask at work, a KN95 or better. I really don't need anyone's summer cold or other virus. The regular mask I wear on the subway is less wonderful, but I need to be able to breathe."
2021-07-06 23:45:36,"Around here it seemed like when things opened up and they dropped the mandate everyone was waiting for someone else to go first--I went Day One maskless to a grocery store and was definitely an outlier.

There will always be a few people who need extra protection, and there will always be a few who are either overly worried or get satisfaction out of being the most careful person in the room.  To each their own. 

If I am somewhere that it's required (or politely requested by the proprietor of a business, not just the stink eye from another customer)  I'll wear a mask.

 But I did not have 90 percent of what my family and I do get canceled, then listen to months of people agonizing grandstanding and fighting over who gets what vaccine when, and then drive across town and stand in a line longer than Disney on a holiday weekend, twice, to be told ""oh, just kidding, it doesn't matter.""

I'm on Team ""get the darn thing and go do stuff."""
2021-07-07 01:35:17,"The Biden administration is underestimating the virulence of the Delta variant and overestimating the vaccines efficacy against it.

Israeli data indicates that the Pfizer vaccine is only 64% effective against the Delta variant, when it was 94% effective against the original strain.

Covid is winning the war and the pandemic will worsen.

The CDC should agree with the WHO and mandate wearing masks and social distancing for everyone again in all situations.

Thanks to republicans and vaccine holdouts the virus will mutate quickly and we may see a strain that the vaccines have no efficacy against: back to square one."
2021-07-08 21:50:19,"Today I had to go to the grocery store.  I saw multiple families with multiple children too young to be vaccinated, all maskless and running about the store.  This is going to make getting food a real problem for immunosuppressed people.  Why can’t we at  least keep the masks on in places we all have to go?  Is it that much of an imposition to wear a mask for a half hour so the poor guy with a transplant who shopped at the same time as you doesn’t die from your COVID?   
And it’s going to fuel a nice big spike so we can all lose our jobs and have our businesses tank again.  Thanks ever so much for that, you maskless idiots.  The only thing that is going to mend the economy is getting rid of this virus and so far it seems half the country isn’t interested in doing that."
2021-07-09 23:59:36,Just happened to re-read this article today and decided to glance at Public Health England study linked with the article.

Have the Brits cracked the code on this?
2021-07-11 18:47:11,"Friends tell me to hunker down, avoid “high risk people” and wear masks everywhere just like before we had vaccines.  They claim even though I’m vaccinated, I can get and spread the disease with sufficient likelihood obligating me not just to wear a mask but to isolate, especially in a “low-vaccination community.”  This is an over-reaction.  I was responsible and got vaccinated to help us move forward from this pandemic.  I am done punishing myself for others who refuse to do so.  Evidence now shows the vaccines protect against infection to an effective degree, not just against hospitalization or severe disease, against infection regardless of symptoms.

That being said, vaccine-resistant strains are our likely next challenge and we need to stay on top of this with regular booster shots ongoing.  How many more years will we struggle with this?  How long will immunity last in the long term, whether natural or through vaccines?  Only time will tell. 

Too large a percentage of the American population adamantly refuses to get vaccinated, wear masks or believe in the existence of the coronavirus (or science or medicine for that matter).  Outside of vaccine mandates, they contribute to herd immunity in only one way: they get infected.  Others tell me to make that my problem and act as if my vaccine does nothing.  I don’t think so.  By getting the vaccine (and the next booster vaccines as they come out), I’m protecting them.  That is the best I can do and that is enough."

He is the kindest most generous person I have ever known in my life. People who we think would know better are unvaccinated and our being around them threatens his life and they don’t get it. So we have to avoid them and double mask indoors and wait for the science and studies to play out. I don’t know how he stays calm and patient- I’ve been terrified for him since last March.

We can remember polio, both before and after Salk and Sabin.  People today don't want to know how lucky they are - the most cursory reading confirms that covid isn't a disease anyone should risk getting and that any vaccines were so quickly available is almost miraculous.

The daily question should repeatedly be:  Did you have the polio vaccine?  Did your family?  Are your grandchildren immunized?  Then why not covid?  And not being immunized means you could ultimately expose others - your family, grandchildren, friends, strangers - and as the delta variant indicates, covid grows stronger as will the risks when other variants appear."

Although I’ve eaten in restaurants twice, and gone into a few stores without a mask—this was before Delta was making headlines— I’m not doing it anymore until J&J releases more robust information. 

As an aside, I got a sinus infection that turned into bronchitis, (Covid PCR test was negative) that I’m sure I got on one of those maskless excursions. It was worse than any infection I’ve had, and it took me more than a month to recover. My doctor said that my immune system was likely overreacting to a common virus due to lack of exposure to viruses/bacteria in the last 18 months. Just something to be aware of."

I still mask when I enter any store or enclosed space. Not only because I feel it's still necessary to set an example about not contracting the virus, but also so I don't infect anyone with any strain of the virus I might be immune to, but they may not. Second, the possibility of Coco Gauff not being vaccinated because of her busy schedule is not only not an excuse it is a dangerous, foolish insult to anyone who may have contact with her, especially opponents and her now-former Olympic teammates. It is no more acceptable than any other excuse for not getting vaccinated put forth by any individual or group. Last, how often is the Times going to ignore the fact that North America is comprised of three, not two, countries: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It's very good news that our dear friends and neighbors to the north have been able to catch up and surpass our vaccination rate. Please have your reporters turn 180 degrees south and report of great and good friends in Mexico. It's the large country that shares our southern border, much in the same way that Canada shares our northern one. If they're not too dizzy from the half-spin, perhaps they can report on vaccination rates for all of North America."
2021-07-19 13:26:35,"I'm fully vaccinated, but my mask stays firmly on my face. The vaccine doesn't prevent you catching the virus; only mitigating it's effects.

2021-07-20 14:47:49,"@Tara Pope 
You shared the following quote from Dr. Offit: 
""The same people who aren’t masked often aren’t vaccinated. Those two things usually go hand in hand. When you see people masked inside, they’re often the ones who are vaccinated.”

First of all, I think this is a misleading statement and not backed by data. Secondly, how exactly does this lengthy opinion section by Dr. Offit get our society closer to ending the pandemic? 

As you mentioned, CDC guidelines say that fully vaccinated people can choose whether to wear a mask indoors, except for settings such as public transport or hospitals.  Though I acknowledge there are secondary benefits to wearing a mask in crowded places (e.g. reducing your chances of getting a cold, avoiding environmental irritants, etc.), encouraging vaccinated people to wear masks won't end this pandemic; only high levels vaccination can do that. 

It seems ineffective and misguided to point fingers at vaccinated people who aren't masking, when in reality, unvaccinated people are almost entirely responsible for the the rising cases and hospitalizations we are experiencing. Only through vaccination do we have the power to end this pandemic in America (a pandemic that is still raging in many other countries, as I'm sure you are aware). Please use your platform as a journalist to encourage vaccination as clearly and emphatically as possible. Thank you."

My family all still follow original protocols and protection including wearing a mask (to protect ourselves and others).

I’ve noticed many others doing the same, the majority do not.  Americans don’t care about themselves or fellow humans even when scientists give us information to prevent pending disasters.  Climate change, disease, etc.  

I wish no harm to anyone but I have lost any empathy for those who resist helping themselves and their fellow humankind.  You have no belief in a higher power, no moral compass, empathy or much needed sense of responsibility to help others.

This is no longer accurate- my father's skilled nursing facility is currently in lockdown, 18 out of 19 infected residents were vaccinated with Pfizer-- one died yesterday, one is hospitalized, and several others have symptoms. This occurred over the span of a week. 6 staff members also infected and quarantined."
2021-07-21 05:29:48,"Breakthrough cases really are not rare, unless you are using old data from the previous variant. The Israeli data shows that about 50% of infections happened in vaccinated people. Similarly, Massachusetts is now estimating about 43% of infections to be in vaccinated people. These do tend to be moderate cases. However, the risk is growing for children, who have seen a huge spike in cases in just the past week. Clearly the vaccines are effective at preventing hospitalization and death but when it comes to Delta, the risk of infection post-vaccination is still considerable. Therefore some return to masking and social distancing is to be expected."
2021-07-22 14:05:02,"I got the J&J vaccine in late March and waited 4 weeks before unmasking.  After unmasking I got sick with cold-like symptoms several times, but tested negative twice.  I also donate blood on a regular basis.  The Red Cross tested for both types of antibodies, ones from exposure and ones from the vaccine.  On my last donation I was positive for both.  I’m pretty sure I had a breakthrough infection already.  It’s not surprising.  I also get yearly flu shots and have had breakthrough infections with those too.

My question is, are you any more protected from delta if you had Covid recently and the shot, than if you just had the shot?  I’m concerned because I had the less effective J&J shot.  I’d really like a booster of mRNA."

In particular, are outdoor activities (e.g., going to the zoo on a weekday, going on walks on sidewalks with some foot traffic, etc.) still considered safe to do with children? One of my kids is higher risk, so we must avoid getting the virus until they're eligible for the vaccine. Nobody in my state wears masks anymore, and my youngest is too young to wear masks. We try to keep some distance from other people, but unmasked women often approach us to talk to my kids, comment on the fact that I have twins, etc.  Are these short interactions outdoors dangerous?"
2021-07-23 11:10:15,"Mask or no mask? That is not the question.

Googles or no googles is the pressing issue. Over six months ago I began alerting the key media that the spread of the covid-19 virus was spreading through the tears of our eyes.

My efforts were ignored, so I will try again. Our eyes are continually awash with three layers of tears, each serving a different function. However, what the general public, and much of the health community, do not realize is that those tears drain through ducts into our nose and then the throat.

From our nose and  through our throat it is a short trip to our lungs.  Why else do we wear masks over our nose and mouth? Why else do hospital health workers wear shields over their entire face?

Worse yet, this vulnerability of our eyes is a source of new variants of the virus. A fundamental principle of evolutionary development is that an existing virus displays variations, some more common than others, and each with unique traits. Surely, some of those variants are more adept an glomming onto the tears of our eyes.  Consequently, while we may be protected against variants entering directly through our nose there are some variants that glom onto our eyes, and they will soon become the dominant route of transmission. This dynamic is analogous to bacteria becoming immune to anti-biotics, due to the survival and hence replication of those with unique evasive traits.

In short, the emergence of the ""delta"" variation was predictable. Thanks to the Republicans."

At its initial outbreak and signs of uncontrolled contagion, we should have mandated a one-month national ""medical holiday"". No work, no travel, no worship, no concerts, no sports, no gatherings at all. This one-month national lockdown would have stopped the virus in its tracks. It certainly wouldn't have made it worse. 

It is not too late to test this approach to the virus. A set of counties  in the country can be randomly selected to participate in this lockdown.  The economic impact on these selected experimental counties can be avoided with federal funds. Let us see, then, the virus activity in these randomly selected counties. If we find dramatic drops in infections, the lockdown can be rolled out to a national level and world level.  A procedure that cannot hurt, can only help."

The casual mention of an undercount makes it seem it is India or Russia (with ten fold undercounts). Relatedly. Brazil, despite the devastation, still ranks somewhere close to the US and to Europe in deaths per capita over the length of the pandemic (when undercounts are eliminated). Not a point of pride, but it gives some perspective.

Perhaps worse of all, the writer says the country is ""struggling"" with vaccination. This is not the case and has not been the case for a while. In Rio, where I am writing from, 55% of the adult population has received at least one shot, and hospitalizations, cases and deaths  are down sharply, to some of the lowest levels of the pandemic. Indeed, vaccination is about on par or ahead with much of Western Europe and far ahead of Asia and Eastern Europe, not to mention Africa.

""President Jair Bolsonaro has led a strikingly lackadaisical, dismissive and chaotic response""  Substitute ""President Trump has led...""   

""That cavalier attitude alarmed doctors...""

""Mr. Bolsonaro has told Brazilians repeatedly that they had nothing to fear. The restrictions that became the norm elsewhere were wild overreactions that would devastate (the) economy, he warned.""

""effusive endorsement of hydroxychloroquine...""

""the president put Eduardo Pazuello, an army general with no background in health care, in charge...""  Trump put Mike Pence in charge.  

""the world’s second-highest total behind the United States""

“I’m very sad about the situation we’re in. We need leadership that believes in the disease and takes the situation seriously.”

It all starts on how you view science and its place in our world. Trust is a big factor or lack thereof. As is knowledge and scientific literacy. For various reasons, including a lack of education, religious beliefs, major scientific errors and perceived corporate greed, science in general has to regain this trust. This will take time and effort. Science needs to show in clear ways how it benefits humanity. Science has to also show some humility when it is warrantee.

The media has a major role to play, as do prominent scientists, to counter misinformation and just plain bad science. Many, including NYT, have done an excellent job in this regard. But there is much more work to be done."

Because so many incredibly stupid Americans refuse to be vaccinated there is still a chance that variants will develop HERE that might throw us back into the fray once again.

2021-06-24 13:21:16,"The inevitable number of deaths caused by the Coronavirus pandemic in Brazil was made much worse by the fact that a psychotic and unbalanced former military, called Jair Bolsonaro, had been elected president in October of 2018 and took office in January of 2019. Since March of 2020 he completely disregarded measures to combat the pandemic and fired two of his Ministers of Health to appoint an Army general for this office. No effort was made to clearly negotiate the acquisition of vaccines because Bolsonaro claimed that alternative medicines such as “Chloroquine” (labelled by the World Health Organization as clearly ineffective for this purpose) were effective. 
Since his first day in the presidential office, Bolsonaro has announced that he plans to be reelected in 2022 and has been clearly campaigning in frequent travels to all corners of big Brazil, during which he claims that isolation and lockdowns should be avoided since they would cause an increase in the already exceedingly high unemployment rate of 14%.
There are presently over 150 requests in the Brazilian Congress for Bolsonaro’s impeachment, but the president made it clear that measures against him may cause a national commotion and that only God can take him away from office."

This might ignite an impeachment process and Bolsonaro's popularity is at a record low since he came to office in january 2019. Unfortunately, he still has the dangerous support of the military state police forces and the army. Either Brazil will get rid of him through an impeachment or in next year's election, or he will stage a coup d'etat and initiate another military dictatorship in Brazil. The opposition has no guns, only words, and  growing popular support. Meanwhile, it is a real tragedy in Brazil: a corruption scandal inside a health crisis, inside an environmental crisis, in an economic crisis and a political crisis..."

But if you look at the photo of the mother being vaccinated, you can see the love in the eyes of her two children looking on. If you go to the beaches of Rio, you don't see gaiety or celebration but you do see many smiling faces -- as if people are determined to not let it get them down. The government hearings about the pandemic drag on -- one shocking revelation after the other. A pall of depression hangs over those who are still watching them. Bolsonaro will not be impeached; no one will go to jail or even be fined. Faced with an enormous drop in revenues, the financial measures of the government are not guided by any overall plan. They are jerky and uncoordinated. 

Not everybody in Brazil is going to die. Eventually they will be vaccinated, the workers will return to work, the corrupt politicians will be reelected. Brazil will return to normal!"

We barely did any contact tracing or random COVID surveys, all of which needs to happen through a robust public health system focused on prevention, not only intervention. We still don't have one good double blind study on vitamin D prevention, which would have been easy enough to do by giving 5000 IUs a day to one nursing home patients and employees and not another, and which retrospective studies showed as promising. Even Fauci stated he takes this supplement daily. We are now flying a drone on Mars and still cannot recommend vitamin D or get N95 masks?"

2021-06-24 15:54:31,Bolsonaro turned down chances six times last year to buy Phyzer vaccines while Brazilians were begging for shots. The Chinese stepped in and vaccinated millions. I got my coronavac shots this March in Brasilia but the situation in Brasil is getting worse daily. Really sad.
2021-06-24 17:01:58,"Bolsonaro is a national leader who came to power during the suspiciously synchronized rise of authoritarian figures around the world. Their policies hurt their own people and helped destabilize the world. But they all semed to appear at once, didn't they?

You may recall, we had one of those for 4 years in the U.S. Coincidentally he, like Bolsonaro, also pushed the curious choice of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, against all evidence.

Trump also had a pandemic response that was a combination of ""What, me worry?"" and ""I'm a tough guy and I'll beat COVID and so will you!"" 
It's a response that should be studied, less by political scientists and more by psychologists, because only mass psy-ops can explain how one could convince large segments of the population to dismiss their own safety concerns.

Brazil needs to do what we did: flush their ""leader"" and replace him with a president whose first obligation is to his people.

After which, someone really ought to look into how all these fascists just happened to pop up all at once in places where they were least expected. Like the United States and Brazil."
2021-06-24 16:01:19,"Brazilians chose Bolsonaro just as Americans chose Trump. Leaders who are motivated by Egotism and Ignorance are more likely to be responsible for deaths caused by environmental problems that need to be solved by educated decision making. India too has been plagued by Modi's emphasis on his political reputation instead of following the scientific understanding of controlling the spread of the Covid epidemic. 

Democracy is only as good as the people responsible for the selection of their leaders. Surely no voter with 10 working neurons should have believed anything Trump and Bolsonaro told them. The greatest Hoax of the Trump administration was the belief that Donald J. Trump was capable of being a successful POTUS. Now Brazilians see how Bolsonaro, like Trump, has been unable to prevent preventable Covid deaths by his ridiculous posturing and empty ideas."

It breaks my heart when I look at the pictures I took of the colorful homes in the Favelas and the close proximity of homes where most public resources such as water and toilet are shared. How did these people make a livelihood with no tourists and no space to maintain a distance in their own neighborhood? Bolsonaro should be held responsible."

This, for underestimating a tiny virus that could care less who is affected...and dies as a result. Although a bit late to remedy what we've lost with Covid-19, it would be a dereliction of duty if we are not doubling down in R & D....for the infectious agents that may, right now, be rolling their sleeves for action.

This is an example of how important it is for people to understand who they are voting for. Bolsonaro has been a terrible leader but they are stuck with him. Fortunately for us, we had elections and people realized how badly Trump was handling the pandemic. The pandemic has shone a light on those who are totally inept to lead a country under duress, such as Trump, Bolsonaro, Maduro, Putin etc. This is not about conservative or liberal politics, this is about the absolute ineptitude of these leaders."

Collectively, we flat out failed to get to the right answer.  Later, is failure.  Fiddling around with extinguishing the “embers” (vaccine hesitancy) is madness.  I guess we are slow learners…"
2021-06-24 16:29:58,"Considering Brazil's impressive progress in upgrading its public health capacity prior to the Bolsonaro regime, the near collapse of decent healthcare in the face of the coronavirus crisis is as tragic as it is appalling. It is in major measure a function of the collapse of serious governance. The human capital exists for an effective, science-based response but the government declines to marshal such resources.

The long-standing but continuing pandemic carnage in Brazil is of a piece with conditions in other extreme right-wing governed countries, notably India and, until 2021, the United States. In those countries, voters deemed it a good plan to elect to power charlatans with neither a serious interest in nor a palpable ability to govern.

Several years ago, Paul Krugman put this political pathology as well as anybody by writing, in effect, ""a culture that believes that government is bad will always have bad government."" It turns out that such governance is massively lethal: half a million dead in Brazil and upwards of 600,000 here at home.

With our political choices, we are simultaneously committing collective suicide and killing our own compatriots."
2021-06-24 15:37:06,Scott Atlas and HHS adviser Paul Alexander pushed for herd immunity through infections ala Bolsanaro. Even if you take their theory at face value--namely the harm caused by lockdown restriction is worse then cost in human lives and that only the elderly need to be protected--it completely ignores the fact that the more you let the virus rage unchecked the more the chances of deadly variants that will likely kill large numbers of younger people eventually.  Only 70 thousand votes across a few crucial states protected us from further insanity.
2021-06-24 17:02:34,"My mother lives in Sao Paulo. It saddens me, as I will not be going down there to visit this year.  My mother has drank the  Bolsonaro kool-aid. She insist the virus is under control and fading. And it wasn't really all that serious to begin with.  She insists the media is making something out of nothing and I should not cancel my trip. It is frustrating and I worry about her not taking wise precautions. She has a pacemaker and is in the high risk group too.  I can't live her life for her though. My mom is an example why Bolsonaro actions and words are not only counter productive, but outright dangerous."

In the US it is 1.79%, while Brazil has a 2.79% rate.  Yes, Brazil is in dire straights, but we are arguing about who's in 98th and 99th place in a field of 100.  For all of our medical prowess, we can't do much better than Nepal or Kenya (1.2 and 1.66 per cent).  The Virus has clearly won here.  We had best get the whole world vaccinated before the next round."

2021-06-24 16:48:01,"We've heard much criticism of Trump, Modi, Bolsonaro, and the democratically elected rulers in Europe for the high death rates due to Covid.
But consider this scenario. Suppose on Sully's flight, the rulers just mentioned had been on Cactus 1549, who of them should try to land the plane?
Merely because they got elected does not qualify them to fight a pandemic any more than it would qualify them to land a plane.
Covid-19 has revealed a catastrophic failure of democracy, and government in general. This doesn't bode well for climate change, already claiming lives, with rulers driving the plane towards an unprecedented disaster.
Since the rulers got into the driver's seat, CO2 levels have increased about 50 ppm, with the saw tooth graph ominously trending upwards.
While the rulers advance the bogus claim that they're ""entitled"" to rule their fellow human beings. That's no scientific fact, nor a ""noble"" lie, but an evil one. The ruler principle must be questioned and rejected, not only to achieve liberty and justice, but to avoid future catastrophic failures of government from harming any more people.
Like families of Covid victims in America and India, Brazilians are paying the cost of government in terms of huge numbers of Covid deaths."
2021-06-24 19:32:34,"I am a doctor in Brazil.
The worst aspect of our society is the lack of proper education, even among many doctors, teachers, lawyers, engineers etc. Most people have no idea about scientific methods, so they believe in whatever is thrown at them. 
The second worst aspect, perhaps a consequence of the first one, is that we as a nation are very keen on the idea that faith solves almost everything. So people choose to have faith in the politician of the moment, over and over again, instead of rationally choosing who is going to lead us based on their background and prior contributions to our society. Following the same behavior, people choose to believe that a magic medicine will cure covid despite every concrete explanation you provide them. I'm talking about doctors, engineers, lawyers... The problem increases 10-fold with the rest.
Right now we are fearing a third wave on top of the second one that hasn't even receded yet, while vaccination increases in a slow but steady pace. Restaurants, Shopping malls, Bus stops, Airports, etc are all packed with people, while our leader keeps on saying there is no need to be afraid of anything. 
As a doctor, the only thing left to do is have some of that crazy faith, believe the vaccines will work and everything will be alright somehow in a few months. I just know I'm really tired of leaving a hospital filled with dozens of improvised ICU beds just to see people gathering in a bar to watch soccer games as if nothing is actually going on."

People are lining for hours for access to their bank accounts, and bank machines are out of bank notes. Businesses do not have change and ask customers to donate the difference. 
The Justice software  in Rio Grande do Sul has been out for weeks, hacked, and unable to process a notoriously slow system ,where it is common for a simple case to remain unresolved for years. At every corner there are homeless people sitting on a piece of cardboard without even the energy to beg for food.
Meanwhile , the multi layered political system continues to make conflicting decisions, adding to the confusion: state governors are ordered to testify before a Senate commission, only to receive an order not to appear by the Supreme Court.
My city's mayor has promoted ivermectin and hydrochloroquin  for months, and finally discreetly stopped doing so after his re election a few months ago.
Now winter is here, with a sharp increase of respiratory illnesses, and yet people gather in closed shopping centers, food courts are full , in the streets many people smoke to justify not wearing a mask. 
There is a stubborn attitude among  Bolsonaro supporters to refuse social distancing, masks,  vaccine efficiency.

2021-06-24 19:41:32,"Bolsinaro and other heads of state both past and present who have knowingly ignored science, data and reality should be held accountable and charged with crimes against humanity. They have willingly misled their citizens and in effect have sentenced them to death."
2021-06-24 21:13:33,"I have lived in Brazil since 1977, and lived there from 1968-1971, during the height of the military dictatorship. Today is far worse than then. 
Yes, the military tortured, disappeared and killed a few thousand people - but every day in Brazil today, over 2,000 people die from an unseen enemy. 
Bolsonaro was elected in a wave of ""anti-Lula"" and ""anti-corruption"" fervor, because Lula and his stalking horse Dilma presided over the worst sacking of the country's wealth in its history, as shown by the Lava-Jato investigations. 
Ex-president Lula is now free to run again, and likely will in 2022; he will likely enjoy an ""anti-Bolsonaro"" wave of support, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, and if so, he will win, notwithstanding the stain on his prior record.
I believe Trump lost the election largely because of Covid-19 - the economy was booming, his anti-immigrant policy was hugely popular in an increasingly isolationist America, and his fervent appeals to evangelicals should have carried the day.
Bolsonaro's economy is not booming -- it's only gradually improving, as both inflation and unemployment have hit decade-long highs. Yes, his appeals to evangelicals will carry some weight, as will hs pandering to gun advocates, but that should not be enough.
My wife is Brazilian, we have plenty of family members who voted for Bolsonaro - and almost all of them are sorry they did so now. That switch should carry Lula back to the presidency."

He told people to NOT get vaccinated. A country tried to send thousands of doses of the vaccine to Brazil and he rejected it. He does not believe in science or climate change. He is a dangerous and extremely disturbed person. God help Brazilians if he is in office for one more day! He also wants to cut down the Amazon (and has).

Delta has not taken over in the US, but we can take the ""R number""  from India; which will be bogus because of an ineffective, overwhelmed, health system, and pressure from the Modi government. The next country to look at will be the UK.

Having worked as an epidemiologist for 8 years, this scares the s**t out of me. The average America will think ""Covid is Covid"" , and ""I haven't got it so far"". I'll wait for Dr Fauci and others on whether Covid is ""going nuclear"".

On the plus side Pfizer and Moderna can have a vaccine for any
Covid strain that arises. Once the DNA of the hybrid is sequenced, they can create the mRNA vaccine dose to combat it.

The mRNA technology was developed in the 1990's by Hungarian Scientist Katalin Karikó, who was exploring a way to induce human diabetics to produce insulin with mRNA. She got almost no funding for this, but she may have ended up saving the human race."

In both cases during the rise and spreading of the virus, the two countries have been led by an uncaring and incompetent president, whose habit is to lie and deny reality.

And yet in our case at least, the president's political party and supporters treat him as some kind of tin-pot god.

Our “vax-glow” (and the sticker my husband wore) drew a greeting from the man, who thanked us for getting the jab. Turns out he’s on the local police force, his wife works at our local hospital. This brief human exchange with complete strangers, with this beautiful newly-minted family unit, gave me so much hope for the future of our community. I think of them often."

She imagined — feared — that she did not get enough of the vaccine.  I didn’t help the situation, because I couldn’t stop chuckling. I had to stop her from charging back to demand another shot.  The vaccine, of course, made sure that she had nothing to worry about. It slammed her, hard. She was in bed for a day and half with a slight fever and moaning. We are ever so grateful for the shot and the healthcare providers who jabbed us. So, I vote for the stack of chocolate for everyone involved in the vaccine. I wish I had thought of that!"

Currently WASH-U (Washington University in Saint Louis) is studying me. I don't see how the dozen doctors I'm seeing on a weekly basis are going to be able to help but I figure if they opened entire sections at WASH-U, Mayo Clinic and OHSU then there are people out there who believe us and don't think we're making up stories. I practically had to quit my job because of everything I'm dealing with (for the moment I still have it technically as I'm using my short term disability so I can make all the appointments every week and taking time away from unnecessary stress). It's neither easy nor fun and I wish more people were inclined to believe me and others. Even though you can't SEE our issues and battles we're facing doesn't mean it's not there.

I ironically I am in remission from the cancer and have never felt so bad in the three years of cancer!
All my joints hurt, my heart races, I lose my breath ( which never happened with the cancer), my legs are swollen and I have no energy.
People, friends think they are being helpful by saying get out and walk you're just out of shape from being less active or..."" You, know you're getting older, that's what happens ""
I have been sent to a cardiologist, rheumatologist, vascular surgeon and physical therapy. All test were negative and the therapy did not help. I have an appointment at a post covid treatment center at MT. Sinai Hospital for December! 
There is no help and no answer but I look at the bright side. Even though the medical community is completely stumped, I hope by December they will have learned something."
2021-06-21 16:01:50,"COVID remains rampant across much of the world.  Unless the vaccination rate is very high across the entire US, COVID will come back next winter.
Specifically, the vaccination rate is quite low in Trump country, where vaccine skepticism is strong.  Only 35% have received at least one dose in Mississippi, in contrast to 73% in Vermont.
What is needed is a national program to vaccinate children.  For admission in September, all schools should require COVID vaccination for all students age 12 and above.  That includes Junior High Schools, High Schools, and Colleges.
If this is done uniformly across the country, we will have herd immunity, and we can defeat COVID.
This is a national emergency, and everyone needs to do their part."
2021-06-21 15:40:33,"I too suffered from long Covid, and 15 months after first symptoms, I would say I feel 80-90% better. I am still on an inhaler, still take meds and supplements, and still require a long nap most days. My symptoms have shrunk to manageable fatigue, some neuropathy in my limbs, and insomnia.

But so many of my fellow long-haulers on the support group I belong to are not getting better. And some are expressing desperation. One young mother recently took her life.

I fear that we have a new problem coming, and hope with all my heart that researchers find ways to mitigate this unrelenting virus.

Meanwhile I implore those who choose not to be vaccinated to learn more about the complications of this disease. It can affect you even if you are young, healthy, and have a mild case of Covid.
If you stay vigilant, you can avoid suffering: for so many, without yet an end."
2021-06-21 19:34:28,"A co-worker's husband was a ""COVID Long Hauler"" and after being vaccinated FINALLY had his symptoms clear up.

Hopefully this anecdotal evidence we are seeing in that area proves to be real.

By the same token you would THINK all these horror stories of Long Haul Symptoms would cause at least some of the anti vaccine crowd to rethink that position.

These newer variants are much more contagious and far more deadly and no doubt will have far more long lasting effects. It's Russian Roulette with all 6 chamber loaded to continue to refuse vaccine."
2021-06-21 21:10:07,"I'm so sorry for everyone who got Covid. It's about time that docs realize that except for a headache, symptoms are not ""all in your head."""
2021-06-22 03:49:19,"I have read 'anecdata' that the vaccines help some people recover from long-COVID.  I hope it is true for more of you. And that the entire population will see the necessity of getting fully vaccinated. For themselves and for the good of humanity. 
Good luck to us all."

Thank you for this essential testimony, Ms. Holson."
2021-06-22 18:40:11,"What a peculiar disease. So many symptoms, so many reactions, so many effects, short- and long-term. People are affected very differently and recover differently.

I for one got it very early, in January 2020, when people were just becoming aware of some odd flu in Asia. I am convinced I picked it up while traveling by air. I suffered for two weeks and still have altered senses of taste, smell, and hearing (music is off-key). I tire easily and am sometimes overwhelmed by fatigue.

I am lucky it wasn’t worse and I can still function pretty normally. But that virus is still among us and I don’t trust it one bit."
2021-06-22 13:25:55,"Let's hope that researchers are able to decipher what is going on in the body, and develop  some ways to aid healing ( and to prevent this from happening in Covid and other infections, because whatever is discovered her is going to have wide application).


Is the continuing post Covid problem due to disrupted metabolism? To an immune system that cannot put the brakes on after high alert?  To disrupted or damaged areas in the brain  or neurons  or blood vessels all over the body, which require ample time without further challenges to rebuild?

Went back to read the original article again. One of the things I feared most, but I found that the anti- or non- vaxxers did/do not, was the possibility of long or permanent debility.  I don't know if they have  a failure of imagination, fear of facing the risks or simply weren't close enough to the centers of infection last year.

There are some times when I have wondered if in fact, I might have had a non-symptomatic infection last year, because a number of the signs reported affected me from last August-September on (dizziness, extreme fatigue, erratic sleep, brain fog, rapid pulse; also muscle tremors) but have disappeared  or lessened now. 

There could be people who were infected without knowing it -- it was not easy to get tested unless you HAD all of the CDC symptoms."
2021-06-22 17:10:58,"Whenever the number os deaths are voiced I want to add the numbers of those who have yet to recover.

And this is despite reaching out to my doctor immediately for help. It is imperative that medical professionals learn about long covid and the various ways it can present in patients. Finally, I am getting some expert guidance from a doctor at a regional 'long covid' clinic and working through a protocol that is bringing some relief. I hope others who are suffering can find some relief as well, and that everyone else realizes that long-term disability is a distinct possibility for young, healthy people who contract covid."

I slept for 4 hours.,The next night I took the same adult dose, didn’t sleep at all. This lasted 3.5 weeks. Im a retired RN. My retired RN friends worried about me, started doing research. Lots of long haulers have this severe insomnia. A small percentage of people have this neurological immune response from the vaccine.

I would have had the vaccine, even if I knew I would have this reaction.My brother, upon hearing what had happened to me, bought some CBD tincture with low THC at a dispensary and priority mailed to me. I slept for 7 hours. 3 weeks tonight, and I sleep 7-8 hours every night.I have been reducing the dose from 1 ml, now down to .50 ml. With the 25 percent tax in our state, the cost is $70 for a 2 week supply. I purchased some CBD seeds with low THC on line and they are now germinated. Being auto flowering plants, will take 8-10 weeks to harvest, then dry. Tincture recipes readily available online. Was always skeptical about such things, but a miracle for me.

2021-06-30 05:29:07,"I  wrote previously about my health AFTER the first vaccine shot. (Got both). SOME of the symptoms (bone and joint pain) eased up. They did not ENTIRELY disappear, and continue to be an annoyance. 
I find myself taking naps 6 hours after waking up - and after returning home from doing some part time work, which is quite physical. At no point during work do I feel fatigue, yet when I get home and sit in a chair, it is as though someone gave me anesthesia and I find myself unable to keep my eyes open. The irony of this is that I have insomnia (it would be nice if sleepiness occurred every night at 11 pm). As an example,  at 4 pm this afternoon, after returning from moving heavy containers for 4 hours, I found I had to lie down. (I was awake at 8 am after going to bed at 3am (the insomnia).  

 My naps can be 1 hour long, but sometimes two and  even then I hear the cellphone ring - 2 feet away - and yet find myself unable to rouse myself enough to answer it in time. I have never been hard to wake up: I used to hear a car horn down the street and I'd be instantly awake. Not now. And at 70, the usual response by acquaintances is: ""Well, you're getting older. "" My irritable reply: ""Old age didn't suddenly appear in April 2020. Don't be an idiot. This is clearly post-COVID symptoms.""

2021-06-16 22:16:40,"There is plenty of blame to go around, however Trump got things started terribly by trying to hide the problem and not informing the public that the virus was spread primarily by air. Do we know when the entire CDC was aware of the full potential of the virus to spread? Trump should never have been the decision maker when his goal was help his election instead of protecting citizens health. Top CDC officials were muzzled by Trump and the CDC never caught up."
2021-06-17 01:23:50,"Isn’t it telling, in a subtle way, that a fairly lengthy article, focusing primarily on the failings of the CDC throughout the coronavirus pandemic, has not one mention of Robert Redfield, the director until January 2021?!"
2021-06-17 02:12:55,"In a word, no, the CDC can never be fixed.  It needs to be terminated and all those activities and responsibilities sent back to the states.  I suggest that regional offices of CDC-like entities be set up so each states does not have to bear all the financial burden but each state must ruthlessly scrutinize their contribution to their regional operation and the utility of the operation.  This has always an unconstitutional federal activity that has been compromised so let us distribute it among and closer to the people."
2021-06-17 14:33:00,"I suggest everyone at least look at thr wiki pages of all the top officials in the CDC and other health agencies

Redfield:
Redfield served on the board of ASAP, which gay groups criticized for anti-gay, conservative Christian policies, such as abstinence-only prevention.[52] Redfield also authored the foreword to the book co-written by ASAP leader W. Shepard Smith, ""Christians in the Age of AIDS"", which discouraged the distribution of sterile needles to drug users as well as condom use, calling them ""false prophets"". The book described AIDS as ""God's judgment"" against homosexuals.[53] At the time of his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Redfield maintained close ties with homophobic activists,[52] although he has publicly supported the use of condoms and denied ever promoting abstinence-only interventions.[15] However, in the 2000s, Redfield was a prominent advocate for the ABCs of AIDS doctrine, which promoted abstinence primarily and condoms only a last resort.[54]"
2021-06-17 18:07:05,"Republicans generally--not just Trump--want to emasculate all government agencies and have come perilously close to succeeding.  It will take more than a pandemic to stop them.  And the loss of swing district Democrats in 2020 gives Republicans great optimism they will succeed. Each call to ""defund the police"" more likely will result in defunding the CDC, FDA, EPA, etc."
2021-06-17 15:00:43,Too many people decided they could control Trump from the inside. The best action would be resign and take your case to the people. Robert Redfield was not the best person to be heading the CDC. Then there was Bob Woodward interview with Trump about which Woodward said nothing. Trump knew  how dangerous Covid was and played it down as he admitted to Woodward.
2021-06-17 17:23:06,"The problems of the CDC were due entirely to previous director Dr. Robert Redfield, who let Trump politicize this world renowned agency.
The independence and scientific integrity of the CDC are now being restored by the new director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.  The international reputation of the CDC will be reestablished."
2021-06-17 18:27:41,"Super kudos to Jeneen Interlandi.  She has provided readers with the detailed, nuanced and thorough reporting that once separated the NYT from its imitators by a mile.

She's also saved inevitable congressional fact-finding commissions innumerable hours of in-person Q & A, not to mention the political grandstanding accompanying them.

It's a long read, but the verdict is quite clear: CDC bureaucracy is internally fraught and its real-time relationship with the states’ public health departments is a mishmosh.

Not so much too big to fail, but too big -- and too beset by political pressures, dubious local alliances, and above all a lack of clarity as to its purpose -- to function.

Several years ago it came down heavily on all romaine lettuce even though the contamination was confined to the Southwest.  Regardless, all baby lettuce boxes are now labeled: no romaine.

Worst of its missteps, however, is Walensky's masking free-for-all, leading Cuomo and Newsom to totally open their states, with the Delta variant -- 3 to 5 times more contagious than the original -- having at least a 6% presence in the US.  

CDC guidelines have given governors just enough rope to hang themselves and their states.  Solely b/c of the vaccines, they find themselves reborn on third base and acting like we've hit a triple. 

Lusting for normalcy, we're ignoring the reach and wiliness of the virus.

And for the moment, the CDC has been effectively sidelined when it should be center stage."
2021-06-17 17:04:59,"First, it is very disturbing that  simple data sharing platforms have not been built for a national organization such as the CDC. Faxes?? In 2021?? 
 
Second, epidemics do not respect city/state boundaries, so there is no excuse for local authorities to refuse to share anonymized public health data with the federal agency. 

Good data is the key to good decisions, especially on a large scale. These two issues need to be sorted out ASAP or 500,000 people have died in vain."
2021-06-17 20:30:03,"The widespread failures of the pandemic response are just another example of why the U.S.' federated system just doesn't work to address a national crisis.  As long as we have 50 state governors empowered to act like 50 different countries, a coordinated response to any emergency that crosses state lines is next to impossible.  How can we possibly have cooperation and data sharing when each state and agency can choose their own software, design their own systems, and bow to their own political pressures?  Even within a single agency, divisions compete for funding and leadership.  We have the same mess in public health that we have in law enforcement, with the same near impossibility of solution."
2021-06-17 22:12:52,"Ahh, the Reagan legacy, underfund and undermine public agencies so you can say ""See, the government doesn't work!"""
2021-06-17 23:44:09,"What a wonderful, succinct way to put the problem: ""Insiders say three problems affect the institution: a lack of funding, a lack of authority and a culture that has been warped by both.""

That same thing, or at least a variation of it, affects departments all over the corporate and government sectors alike."
2021-06-18 05:15:07,"""Scientists there had been far too slow to detect the virus, to develop an accurate diagnostic test for it or to grasp how fast it was mutating. Their advisories on mask-wearing, quarantine and ventilation had been confusing, inconsistent and occasionally dead wrong.""

hindsight is 20/20.  and quarterbacking is much more comfortable from an armchair and on monday morning.    but as i understand, there was a protocol (from the CDC?) for pandemic disasters, but it was not rigorously followed.

some people quit their jobs due to the stress and politicization.  i wish that other agencies in washington dc would use science more, and politics and behind-the-scenes bargaining less.  

one could also say that covid proved that the national government is broken.  some even say that democracy, as practiced by the US, is broken.   also, US citizens are a relatively unruly bunch who want to do it their way.

on the other hand, the trump administration paid the electoral price for its bombastic, ill-informed, disorganized, uncooperative and vindictive behaviors. and companies were able to develop multiple vaccines using mRNA technologies with CDC oversight."
2021-06-18 11:48:15,"it shouldn't be the political football that it has become, but so shouldn't everything. as always, the solution starts with fixing politics."
2021-06-18 14:05:30,"There is no denying the problems but strengthening CDC’s authority to issue more pointed yet less political recommendations is not the solution.  

States differ so much in their epidemiologic situations, contexts and values that one-size-fits-all solutions are rare.  Interventions such as school closings also have social and economic costs such as lost educational attainment and costs to parents who must stay home.  Communities will weigh the benefits and harms differently, so elected officials should decide school closings and similar public health actions.  

A better solution is to empower CDC to provide evidence to inform public health decisions.  Begin by clarifying its authority to gather data from the states and build the necessary modern information systems.  CDC should also have the authority and the resources to conduct rapid studies to characterize how a pathogen is transmitted, how risks can be mitigated, and so on.  Timely epidemiological intelligence reports could support state and local policymakers.

National public health institutes such as the German Robert Koch Institute focus on providing accurate and timely risk assessments, leaving complex decisions to policymakers.  Summarizing the evidence rather than recommendations reduces the temptation for people to attack the science when they don’t like the implications.  Adopting a similar approach would direct CDC’s scientific expertise to best serve the nation’s needs."
2021-06-18 06:44:32,"I feel I'm living in a world dominated by ignorant, selfish, superstitious, and often corrupt elected and appointed officials beholden not to citizens' wellbeing but to some deluded fantasy.

This good article only reinforced that feeling."
2021-06-18 11:06:18,"Public health has been Congress's low-hanging fruit for decades beginning with Reagan.  'The public will never miss this, we can afford not to invest.'  Well that chicken has come home to roost, the CDC is a politicized disgrace.  

Nancy Messonier sealed her fate when she told the truth about COVID early in the pandemic--Trump sidelined her the next day, but Americans had finally gotten the message, 'prepare for significant disruptions'.  She should get a medal for that, at least."
2021-06-18 02:44:06,"""Quarantine powers were used to achieve political goals.""

That is a really explosive allegation.  I would have appreciated it if the article had elaborated on it.  To make a statement like that, without delineating exactly _what_ quarantine powers were used in the service of exactly _what_ political goals makes me question the writer's motivations."
2021-06-18 17:13:37,"In part the CDC relied on incorrect info from the WHO and China.

Big mistake!"
2021-06-18 17:11:50,"This article clearly points out where the issues are, money of course will always play a big role. However as a retired science educator, I think my 45 years in schools and colleges gives me another insight.  Those scientists at the CDC and other agencies were my students.  There is no question some are extremely talented and competent but most have fled to the private sector (thankfully) and gave us the mRNA vaccines quickly and efficiently. The others appear not to be able  to think, problem solve, look for solutions as teams and individuals. Why is that?  I saw science education move from schools where critical thinking was a foundation to  ""everyone gets a medal."" Science fairs became a dreaded endeavour. Projects were shoddy or made by parents. The quality of the education diminished. So these are your scientists today...not the best and the brightest. I spent many days crying when I read their ""latest"" misinformation which led to more deaths and misery. The rewards of the scientist are the knowledge they saved even one person pain or death. What is their reward, a medal?
Also today I read my daily email from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of public health, here is quote from their vice dean.
""Rest to liberate yourself from the archaic and colonial-inspired notion of work”. Public health or politics?  Our premiere health school?
Drs. Friedan and Gottlieb need to come back and recruit the best."
2021-06-18 17:57:50,"I found little linkage between the high-level problems descried and specific failures: confusing messaging, lack of transparency about why recommendations were made, prohibition of screening testing early on and failure to advocate for states to do screening testing of asymptomatic individuals so they could be allowed/encouraged to self-isolate, non-advocacy for AZ vaccine and approval not just  ""emergency use"" of vaccines. [Yes, some of this is FDA related, but that is part of the problem, too.]
More generally, they just do not seem to apply cost benefit analysis to their decisions."
2021-06-19 05:20:44,"This is an exhaustive and exhausting review of all the many problems facing the CDC. 

But what most impressed me is the complexity of collecting health/medical data in these digital times and how the CDC has not kept pace. The CDC I knew and admired was in the 1980's when I earned my MPH in Epidemiology and then taught the subject. Main frame computers were state of the art then and communication was still by the printed word, sent by snail mail. Nonetheless, the CDC was extremely effective as the repository and source of all things public health in the US and globally. 

The digital revolution started just as I graduated medical school so I got to live through some 30 years of the upheaval changing from paper to digital records as it affected hospitals and clinics. This change was hugely expensive and traumatic for all involved. Many clinics, having to make do with cheaper but inadequate software were severely handicapped.

Without a doubt the CDC can catch up with time and the necessary funds. But per this report and recent experience the necessary funds will be denied us by the GOP, per this report. 

And here I am filled with gloom and despair. It's one thing for the GOP to block votes; losing a democracy may still be an abstract, distant possibility to the GOP. But when more than 600,000 Americans lie dead and we've had more than a year of ghastly pictures of the dying and the GOP still doesn't care, then what hope is there for America?"
2021-06-18 21:59:34,"I didn't read this. But I did read Michael Lewis's book Premonition and I was appalled to learn just how unassertive our CDC was early on as the SARS CoV-19 disease launched. And Redfield and Birx and Adams reinforced my dismay. How do you improve an agency that is so easily swayed by a bunch of sleazy, self-serving politicians? I don't know."
2021-06-19 15:06:28,"However bad it has been, COVID is referred to by professionals in epidemiology as a wake-up call, not the truly terrible pandemic with a ten or twenty-percent fatality rate that can and will happen some time in the future. It would appear that COVID, even with 600,000 dead, has not been enough to shock the Red half of the country into reality. Perhaps we need to wait for the Black Death pandemic equivalent with ten, twenty or forty percent death rates to get everyone on the same page at the same time."
2021-06-19 17:12:38,"The CDC needs new leadership and new staff from top to bottom. Their standards have really slipped and even aside from the politicization, the range of their performance through the pandemic has run the gamut from mediocre to appalling."
2021-06-19 16:49:14,"A federal judge in Florida on Friday ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) coronavirus-era sailing orders were an overreach of power, issuing a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the CDC from enforcing the guidelines."
2021-06-18 14:13:36,whatever shortcomings existed at the cdc prior to trump were multiplied x 1000 during trump.  his hamstringing and politicization and incompetence were a trifecta of wrecking balls.
2021-06-18 16:49:54,Simply attacking the CDC is a convenient way to denigrate this professional institution as a whole.  Please recall how the Trump administration politicized it with appointees that strived to remove senior research staff who engaged in verifying alleged treatments for COVID-19 and then determined that many had no merit.  The confusion regarding the validity of this virus to these alleged treatment was a rampant talking from Trump.  It was especially disconcerting when the American public was informed that Trump was aware of just how viciousness COVID-19 was and that his lies are now our history.
2021-06-18 10:14:09,"We continue to insist, against all evidence, that we can assemble groups of dysfunctional individuals (i.e. - all of us) and end up with a functional group."
2021-06-19 22:44:21,"It would have helped this article to set the CDC within the system in which it operates.  Just looking at the agency itself led to problematic logic.  The article suggested that CDC was powerless since the decisions are taken by state public health.  But most hospitals are operational entities which follow CDC guidelines to the letter.  Any change is very significant for them, and so the CDC is careful.  When Covid-19 was first identified PPE was in very short supply even within hospitals, so telling everyone in the US to use a mask would have been correct scientifically but damaging to the system that must respond.  Politics rules this agency in all senses so blame for the problems should be pointed at Congress, Federal leaders and State governors, as well as the CDC upper echelon which is politically appointed."
2021-06-20 10:21:37,"The CDC, along with many other federal agencies, was damaged and almost dismantled by the former guy and his anti-science administration.  What would have happened if it had not been destroyed, pre-2017, and what came out during 2020, are very different.  The CDC needs to be returned to scientific excellence, not denigrated for operating the way the former administration left it."
2021-06-20 10:34:00,"As recently as three years ago I worked for a local health department.  
We were in constant contact with the CDC.  We were always told by them that the ""big"" one was coming; they just didn't know when.  And they were prepared.
It came.  They were not prepared.  They couldn't get their stories straight.  Masks don't help.  Masks do help.  Double mask and then 2 weeks later no masks if you are vaccinated.
And that it just one example of many.
They were not prepared."
2021-06-20 10:39:50,"I recommend Michael Lewis’s latest book “The Premonition” which juxtaposes the CDC and our local public health authorities. I originally lay much of the blame at the feet of Trump but didn’t realize how complicit the CDC was in our catastrophic Covid response.

Budget funds, while certainly an issue, is not the underlying cause of this agency’s woes. It needs to be gutted and rebuilt from scratch; it needs to be given actual authority but also the responsibility to take risks. Until then it is a mere risk-averse advisory counsel at best and a enhancer of disease spread at worst. Personally I believe we would have been better off without the CDC in Covid, a view that two years ago I would have found mind boggling."
2021-06-20 10:44:50,"The CDC might be one of the few federal agencies that is actually nimble enough to adjust and change guidance based on evolving evidence. As a physician, I fully believe they did an exemplary job at developing strategy, reporting information and protecting the public. Perhaps the author of this article might cast their sharp critical gaze at how the agency was able to do this despite a full frontal attack by the most dysfunctional and adversarial executive administration in memory."
2021-06-20 10:57:41,"The way the CDC handled school reopening was a disgrace. When it issued its long-awaited guidance early this spring, the guidelines were stricter than the science suggested was necessary, and more onerous than what most reopened schools were already following. Those districts had to ignore the CDC to keep their kids in school, and that was the right decision. 

Meanwhile, the new guidelines prevented a speedy return for millions of other kids at schools with less will to reopen. It was a catastrophic failure."
2021-06-20 11:02:23,"I hope Americans know that the European CDC doesn’t recommend masks for kids under age 12, and that kids over there have been attending school, in many countries, without masks throughout the pandemic. 

Europe’s CDC also discusses the drawbacks of masks for kids, noting that they can impede their learning and social development. 

Why doesn’t our CDC acknowledge this? Does the virus work differently in Europe?"
2021-06-20 11:02:42,I’m a parent and run a small non profit.  No scientific training.  I could have done a better job than the CDC.  It’s been a shocking and deadly embarrassment that the CDC took over a year to acknowledge that Covid is airborne. It still doesn’t have strong ventilation guidelines for workplace and school.  How about “open a minimum of two windows by 6  inches and create a cross draft.”   Purchase certified portable HEPA filter machines for each room.   I was doing this in spring of 2020... and so should every school and business in America.
2021-06-20 11:08:13,"The CDC is a governmental agency that is mostly run by physicians, perfectly schooled in the art and science of private practice and money making, not public health. Public health is not a dedicated subspecialty like cardiology, so it is little wonder that physicians have little understanding of the importance and responsibility they hold to the community.  Politics derive from power, and wealthy physician groups have powerful sway over the politics of local and state health departments. They use politics to control the growth of other health professions, like nurse practitioners and physicians assistants. Local health departments are often controlled by local politicians, and for the ""defund government"" crowd, this can be a public health disaster.  We cannot be a healthy nation with 50 different opinions about infectious disease.  The media was brilliant in explaining why we are, and continue to be, so confused about COVID 19. It should also point a finger at the role that the medical profession has played in the confusion over COVID 19. We don't need more television dramas about physicians, essentially commercials for the medical profession, brainwashing the public. We need to understand public health. One of the biggest risk factors for COVID death is obesity. The current medical solution appears to be gastric sleeve surgery, not preventative health care. Does that make sense?"
2021-06-20 11:08:28,"The lack of funding is the result of 40 years of public funding cuts by Republicans, with little to no push-back from Democrats. The CDC is apparently waiting for the tax cuts for the rich and corporations to trickle-down to them so they can fund this organization.

Refusal to allocate government monies for the public good is what Republicans believe, while they shovel trillions of tax dollars to private corporations by way of subsidies. This is  what U.S. voters have supported for decades. So every citizen must look in the mirror and consider how their votes may have influenced this course of events."
2021-06-20 11:13:59,"I’m bracing myself for another year of confusion and unnecessary caution around schools, kids and covid risk, thanks to the confusing, overcautious, and politicized guidelines of the CDC. 

Meanwhile, the districts that long ago ignored the CDC will be fully open next year, many of them without masks for kids, and they will be the ones most in line with the science."
2021-06-20 11:15:47,"The US system of funding has a basic flaw: the budget goes to zero every year. This makes it difficult to fund on-going projects and research and leads to vast time wasting lobbying for funding to continue. The CDC (and most of the government) should have a  budget which automatically increases with inflation and requires an act of congress to alter, not to authorize."
2021-06-20 11:19:18,"There are a lot of pitfalls in the CDC bureaucracy, but we need to be clear on this pandemic.The fundamental pitfall was that is was overseen by an administration that found the reality of a pandemic to be inconvenient in an election year. 

Add that to the fact that the Administration had gutted the federal government -because of philosophy that we don't need it - and we had neither adequate supplies, adequate plans nor competent people. Therefore, they decentralized the response and wiped out the equivalent of Baltimore or Milwaukee or Louisville.

The CDC could have been perfect, and we'd still be right here.

By all means, we need to recognize core tasks that the CDC must be able to meet head-on. Disease identification, disease vectors, normal responses - mosquito control? masks? food preparation? water filtration? quarantines? - and disseminate that advice fully.

But more than that, we need to come to a method of balancing economics, elections and the public cost of denying deaths, in that, the fault Dear Brutus, is not in the CDC, but in ourselves."
2021-06-20 11:21:00,"CDC is but one further indicator of a broken America. We all clamor for Obamacare but even if healthcare were entirely free for all citizens, we must acknowledge that the US healthcare industry is not actually about maintaining our health. It maintains the financial health of the industry instead. Those corporations have infected all branches of government and all regulations in extremely negative ways.

The CDC has not been spared from such an environment where the mission of our healthcare system is almost entirely focused on the finances of the industry instead of our health. 

Indeed, all sectors have been affected. It is a house of cards. We are broken. But we are NUMBER ONE in terms of healthcare costs and quite near the bottom with regard to the health of our nation."
2021-06-20 11:26:27,"""Scientists there had been far too slow to detect the virus, to develop an accurate diagnostic test for it or to grasp how fast it was mutating...""

Here's some news for the author - figuring out those sort of things does not proceed on some sort of schedule. It cannot be made to happen more readily but trying harder. Add to that a real desire to deny everything by DJT and the silliness of the statement is clear."
2021-06-20 11:27:44,"The problem(s) with the CDC are the same problem(s) that plague every non-profit, NGO, and academic organization.

As soon as the organization gets bigger than a breadbox, the exact same patterns and behaviors emerge:

- extreme territoriality, with empire-building and fiefdoms endemic;
- mission creep, or worse, as resources are deployed and managed by multitudes of ‘experts’ each with their own pet projects;
- multiplication of silos and organizational complexity, usually to avoid bruising egos or other hard structural decisions;
- cultural warfare between ‘administrators’ and ‘practitioners’;
- failure to promote, retain, or recruit the kind of leadership needed to avoid or mitigate the above. 

I don’t have a silver bullet solution, but you can certainly discount the (primary) problem being “lack of funding”, as many at the CDC will self-servingly claim, for the above reasons.  Like the old joke that the answer to bad government is always more government.
But, perhaps if the entire organization was restructured, given a clear mission by a competent administration, overseen by a diligent government and congress, and depoliticized by eliminating all political appointees, then maybe it would have a chance.
Hiring, paying, and empowering proven, results-based, leaders from the private sector (NOT academia or government) would be the first step, and would costs a lot less than “more funding”, that’s for sure."
2021-06-20 11:33:20,"You should not blame the CDC for failings of overall health policy.  Public health as a whole has been underfunded in the US for decades.  That reality and a president who disdained science created the disaster that was our initial US covid response.  

Don't blame data collection problems on the CDC.  The whole electronic health records industry is to blame, because data do not transfer easily from one platform to another.  Records are balkanized.  In fact, there are mandates for universality and data transfer protocols within the original PPACA (Obamacare) legislation that are not enforced because of lack of monetary and talent resources to do that complex task.  

Military planners know that a key failing is that we always fight the last war.  Doctors and other health experts have for the longest time realized this and try therefore to predict where the next crisis will occur and how to manage it.  The CDC and many experts know this.  In fact, it was the reality of the threat from SARS-1 in 2003 that gave research plans that turned to the ability to rapidly product a vaccine for covid.  

Our problem is political.  We have physicians like Rand Paul who tear medical care apart because of their political biases, and they act as though they never learned a whit of science.  That must be fixed."
2021-06-20 11:33:32,"A large, complex modern nation needs a well-run government to survive. Unfortunately, the US system, designed in the late 18th century, is poorly structured to function well. Federalism and the separation between executive and legislative powers (as well as a fractured bicameral legislature) together create fragmentation of leadership and dysfunction. The different schedules on which different parts of this fragmented government change mean different parts of the government may well have separate and conflicting agendas. And because the Constitution has an outdated enumeration of federal powers, there is a constant risk of the Courts finding federal action unconstitutional.

The CDC's unwieldy organization and dysfunctional operation is one example of a problem repeated over and over throughout America's federal government. The problem isn't government itself. Many countries have more effective and efficiently run democratic governments. The problem is the American system of government. You simply can't run a 21st century nation effectively with an 18th century government anymore than you can run a 21st century hospital effectively with 18th century medical technology."
2021-06-20 11:40:40,"@ Kurt - ""...gutted and rebuilt from scratch"" used to be called business process re-engineering (BPR) in the early 1990's.  It didn't work then either, because human organizations are built to defend themselves and are staffed by human beings who hold self-preservation as a high goal.  In the CDC's case, what would happen to the 11,000 plus people in the current organization? Do you just turn them out and start over with all new staff and leadership?  Where would the new staff, with years of experience, come from?  And, it's not just people that get overhauled.  How do you just instantly rebuild an entire IT infrastructure to modern standards in a timely way while the organization is still operating?

I agree with the notion that sometimes the organization is too dysfunctional to be saved.  However, no organization exists in a vacuum.  Externalities, like funding, politics, and stakeholders, preclude a true ""clean sheet"" approach to reorganization.  In the end, planned, incremental change driven by results-oriented leaders with well established and accepted goals usually wins the day."
2021-06-20 11:40:49,"The lack of a universal medical record database structure is one of the key impediments to improving the CDC's ability to rapidly collect and make use of emerging medical information in a pandemic. If we had a common structure to organize individual medical records, the CDC would be able to issue requests for specific data to medical groups across all 50 states that could be generated swiftly, while guaranteeing anonymity to individual patients.

I know that there has been an effort to develop a medical database structure in the works for over a decade but it's a very difficult task and has been bogged down in disagreements. (Among other things, different medical disciplines have very different documentation needs.) I don't know what the status of this is now, but some initiative on the federal level is needed to develop and fund its development."
2021-06-20 11:43:50,"From reading this article it seems pretty obvious that the CDC and public health departments will need sufficient long-term funding, more flexibility on how to spend funds, modernization of information processing systems and a commitment to changing the organizational structure to make it more collaborative. There also needs to be some standards and authority for getting accurate data from the 50 states. 

This will take time but hopefully everyone realizes it’s in our national interest to repair this great institution. Although the CDC made some mistakes during the pandemic, they clearly did much good.

But I wouldn’t underestimate the much greater failure of Trump and his administration to take this pandemic seriously, follow the science, communicate effectively about how to contain it and put forward a coherent public health response. Trump and his minions were the true disasters here."
2021-06-20 11:56:16,"Of course it can be fixed. Start with the realization that because it is American it is not necessarily perfect. It is, in fact, human, and in regular need of tune-up. Go further, and realize that Americans have elected to the presidency a man without ethics or without commitment to the Constitution. Cookie-jar politics has been a disaster for America--including for the nature of fact, truth, and open inquiry."
2021-06-20 12:02:12,"When under military attack, all Americans are united, and the chain of command is clear. The impact of the pandemic on people, on education,  on business is at least as serious in its scale. 

Learning the characteristics of the virus, even as it spreads, requires that specialists who know the latest and the epidemiological modelling, are empowered to act,  nimbly, through a quasi- military command structure.

Maybe it takes a Presidential order of some kind, that mandates the States to act in unison ,  with gubernatorial power made subject to that ""for the duration"", and subject to Congressional renewal."
2021-06-20 12:14:25,An organization such as the CDC is incredibly important for survival. Congress should pass legislation to make sure it is not a political tool and ensure that critical leaders in the CDC are apolitical in their ideology. What we saw in the last few years is an organization administration that acted orthogonally to that vision and antithetical to disease control primarily due to political pressures and weak CDC leadership.
2021-06-20 12:15:28,"Yes, there were mistakes made, guidance that contained conflicts and the agency was slow in their response to the pandemic.
However, one must lay blame where blame should reside-at the feet of the dotard that used a black marker to alter the path of a hurricane, one who continually bleated he was subject to a witch hunt and the person who continuously undermined the scientists-the former guy.
Agencies such as the CDC, FDA, FAA and others that have a voice in our health, safety and security, should never  be politicized or used as a cudgel.

Again, place blame where it belongs."
2021-06-20 12:17:20,"The CDC, like many other federal agencies, is subject to political influences and the whipsaw effects of changing administrations. Its chaotic responses to the pandemic were linked to the politicians in power and the pliable officials they put in charge. Hopes that this kind of corrupting influence will be eliminated seem quixotic in view of the active political forces now trying to undermine the voting process, and curb the oversight duties of Congress. The prospect for more political corruption rather than less looms over the federal government."
2021-06-20 12:23:02,"The Cordiv pandemic and the following crisis are the wakeup call for not only CDC but also the medical establishment, US society and West led democratic systems. We often see there are too many ideas, a lit of arguments and no consensus and workable solution. I don’t know if in past any Western society had similar problems, but I know the Song Dynasty of China had the similar problems and ended up collapse in the invasion of relatively weak power from today’s Mongolia region.  My real worry is what US will and can do in the next crisis, not just pandemic, without fundamental change in our social structure."
2021-06-20 12:31:14,"While I believe the CDC made a best effort under difficult political conditions and a new virus that few if any knew anything about, however, after reading Michael Lewis book, The Premonition, highlights the inherent problems when a entrenched bureaucracy confronts a any form of newness. I fear this is not the last we have heard of new strains of diseases, meaning, President Biden needs to take a close look at how to make this organization more flexible, more innovative, and certainly, more willing to speak truth to power."
2021-06-20 12:31:55,"It's not often that I invoke Donals Rumsfeld but for COVID there are truly 'known knowns...known unknowns...unknown unknowns....'. The catastrophe involving their PCR diagnostics in the early months has been much analyzed but I still find near inexplicable. Hubris on a galactic scale amongst the reasons!
The writer may be somewhat unreasonable in some of her other criticisms (why I cite Rumsfeld!) - there have been a stupefying array of shocks and surprises which have baffled the most eminent scientists. Unfortunately, more to come.
In many circumstances, rather than issuing edicts, CDC should preface most guidelines along these lines: Based on current knowledge, we advise X, Y, Z. There is not certainty and we will monitor carefully and alter advice as more information becomes available. 
This qualified type of advisory would have protected the CDC from the type of criticisms it has enountered (schools, masks, public events...) which has so dminished the organization."
2021-06-20 12:32:55,"No, the Covid pandemic did not show that the CDC was broken. Rather it showed that all the major health organizations, and national health systems of the western world had significant problems, among them, WHO and where I live, the Pasteur Institute. The CDC was and is not special in that regard."
2021-06-20 12:36:51,"Money won't fix the CDC...what amazed me was the lack of leadership, the lack of a definitive message, the lack of commanding action and assurance.  When we needed science and the AMA the most, they were ineffective.  I am concerned about who will be the next Dr. Fauci but for Fauci, there would have been no credible spokesperson.  The CDC needs to decide whether it's a political organization and clearinghouse or a leader/expert/credible resource in science and medical interventions."
2021-06-20 12:42:27,"Part of what Interlandi aptly described was the evolution of knowledge, and a similar evolution of understanding what we know. While experts had some knowledge of the virus, many pockets of experts advanced knowledge in separate pods around the globe. CDC and others have worked to build networks to share knowledge; individual Chinese scientists shared with the world at personal peril because their authoritarian regime wanted to keep society on an unmuddied message.

Let's not forget that earlier administrations had elevated pandemics to a national security threat, and rightly made pandemic response a part of our national security apparatus, of which CDC was a part. On behalf of the former President, Mr. Bolton dismantled this essential dimension to the national defense. The past administration was heavy on imagination and creativity in their pandemic response, proving that neither is sufficient to control a deadly virus."
2021-06-20 12:44:09,When the US had the Ebola scare in 2014 the CDC seemed reactive instead of proactive. It needs to be much more nimble and transparent than it is now.
2021-06-20 12:44:45,"Good overview of why the CDC has been…slow, inconsistent. And maybe the lack of funding explains the recent NYTimes article outlining the new CDC decision not to track the tens of thousands of breakthrough infections of the vaccinated. Only the most serious (hospitalization or death) will be noted. Oh, but states are free to report all the rest. 

Why does this remind me of the early advice that only those with serious symptoms needed to go to a hospital- aka, way to late.

I do agree with one commenter- one more symptom of an outdated government/Constitutional structure. This article points out the lack of federal CDC mandates re the states- what happened to that Commerce Clause (that was accused of eating the Constitution) - if communicating health info in a pandemic isn’t ‘commerce’, what is it?? 

States Rights v. the big bad Federal Government. Now having killed…what’s the latest total- 600,000? The CDC is just one more symptom and one more casualty of our failure to update our Constitution."
2021-06-20 12:49:05,"Let's see what the post July 4th period brings us.  Clearly the Delta mutation of the virus will become the primary contagion in the US in a matter of weeks and will cause a surge albeit more limited than the surge of a year ago because enough people will be vaccinated.

How many young people who cannot be vaccinated, young people whose parents refuse vaccination and Trump's hammerheads will get very ill post July 4th and more importantly this winter is an open question.

These future surges should be that final wake up call to the unvaccinated this virus is not going to simply fade away.

Even those of us who are vaccinated have to wonder how many hits of covid air, breathed in from asymptomatic carriers can we take before the Delta virus makes all of us ill.

Finally, who is paying all these hospital deductibles and copays when people willingly refusing to be vaccinated become ill enough to be hospitalized?"
2021-06-20 12:49:09,"CDC is a government organization, which is subject to current administration, political influence, internal politics and budget constraints.  It is not surprised to see the current chaotic and seemingly disordered behavior. Nonetheless, CDC works under the current political chaos.

Our CDC has connections with it counter parts of all the globally important governments. They usually receive the first hand information including Coronavirus immediately. 
This important functionality cannot be overlooked.  

CDC can work effectively when dealing with localized disease.  But Covid-19 is a pandemic event that overwhelms CDC's ability to deal with 50 state governments of various state laws and regulations at the same time. Bureaucracy will be in the way of doing things properly.  Of course, it has room for improvement.  Unless we change the way we work on the public healthcare affair, not much will be changed in the new administration.  In the end, bureaucracy is still the name of the game.  Money is always in short supply for government organizations."
2021-06-20 12:50:51,"To ""fix"" the CDC requires a national K-12 curriculum for the teaching of basic arithmetic, basic statistics (especially how to perform risk-benefit analysis),   library science to teach how to qualify an 'expert', and simple physics, chemistry and biology.

Our nation remains a representative democracy that requires an educated electorate.    Listening to the chatter from both sides specific to health issues finds the Dunning-Kruger Effect the norm."
2021-06-20 12:51:07,"Other countries faced the same problems and very few did much better than the US while many have done worse.  Response on many aspects of the pandemic was largely random throughout the world, partly because of real lack of knowledge.  Lack of comparison with other countries is a major flaw of this piece.

Nevertheless is it perfectly obvious that not only more resources but more authority will have to given to the CDC or other agency to have an effective response.  Decisions can't be left up to politicians, either national or state/local."
2021-06-20 12:55:23,"One point is that academic centers represent a major national - and global - resource.  That resource can't be duplicated in a federal agency.  The question is how to organize this pro bono, voluntary resource to capture its strength when you need it."
2021-06-20 12:58:43,"Many of the problems outlines come as a result of not having or conducting meaningful organizational analysis that looks at how effective communications, systems and decision making are in the group. Every organization has to change with the times. It seems this org is stuck in a bygone era. 

Let’s also discuss the obvious too. Republicans don’t want to be governed. They want a all decisions to be made by local power players or not at all. During the pandemic, many conservative states wanted to let the virus take its course and some would have if not for public pressure. 

I think a willing coalition of states might be better at properly funding and supporting some of these agencies than having to depend on a nihilistic Republican Party that is opposed to any spending that could be deemed as socialism."
2021-06-20 13:16:44,All of our institutions are failing. Seventy years of aggressive tax cuts and moving money from the public to private sectors will do that.
2021-06-20 13:21:56,"The political control which Trump exercised over CDC was made possible by the unitary executive theory of government. The Supreme Court has decided tens of cases holding that every government agency must be headed by a Senate-approved executive subject to removal by the president. The most independence it permits is a multi-member board whose members can be removed only for cause. Government science could be protected by putting it under such boards -- perhaps for biology, clinical medicine, theoretical physics/astronomy, and earth science.

CDC is like the immune system -- it contains many specialized cells that focus on health challenges we have faced in the past. You don't need a rickettsiologist every day, but when you need one, nothing but a rickettsiologist will do. CDC has both resource and action functions, but it depends entirely on state and local health departments to carry out the actions. That is why most CDC money flows through to them. It is unrealistic to expect CDC to be operational like FEMA.

Health research, both public health and healthcare, is extremely siloed by medical specialty and disease. Organizations are created to address particular diseases and to advocate for them. NIH and CDC have structures which reflect this fragmentation. They are also driven by doctors, who tend to be hierarchical and to focus on their own disciplines. Most issues are decided by consensus, which takes time to build. This does not make for quick emergency response."
2021-06-20 13:24:49,"If the last year illustrates only one thing, it is that pandemic response needs to be swift.   The CDC needs to create and enforce a modern data collection system, and the states have to submit their data using that system.   Otherwise they are unable to make timely decisions during a fast changing situation"
2021-06-20 13:42:01,"1) Use the limited evidence, make a decision, communicate that clearly. 
2) Get more evidence, change the decision, communicate that clearly. 
3) Get ripped to shreds over and over for being wrong at step 1. 

Even the best-case scenario does not work. 

Imagine masks were recommended from the start. Would people have stayed 6 feet apart as well (which is more important)? No. The masks were then added. And the public teardown began. 

CDC messed up the test kits. No doubt. But every communications decision was a no-win."
2021-06-20 13:47:14,"Ever notice that after Republicans are in charge we have to have discussions about what they broke and if it can be fixed?  

Maybe if we didn't elect people who want to break government we wouldn't have to keep fixing it or have these discussions. 

We then could talk about how much we progressed."
2021-06-20 13:48:55,"Puh-LEEZ, let's not forget on whose watch this all evolved.  This is like blaming a perfectly well designed weapon for not functioning because it was secured under lock and key when it was needed."
2021-06-20 13:50:18,"Seems like a thorough job until you get to the Manatee schools section that misrepresents that schools reopened in January when a great number of that county’s schoolchildren and staff returned in person, in school in mid-August. That timeframe, before immunizations, provided much information. An error so easily caught by anyone with local knowledge throws the accuracy of the entire article into question. Where was the desk, I ask so often about what I used to consider one of our chief papers of record."
2021-06-20 13:55:00,"It actually appeared to me that the biggest problem with the CDC was political interference from the former guy's Republican administration. They turned everything into a political cudgel from acknowledgment of the pandemic as reality (they framed it as a hoax), to wearing masks, to getting vaccines.

No organization is perfect. However political interference with the CDC was the main problem at the CDC."
2021-06-20 13:55:22,"@617to416
All so true. Effective government is the synergistic sum of its parts and those parts always need updating. Lots of room for small and big fixes and I much prefer that route to the chaos of revolution. How fundamentally dynamic is our system of government? The CDC is just one element in what feels like an historic inflection point for that question."
2021-06-20 13:56:26,"Taxes paid by the bottom 95% of households do not generate enough revenue to fund a government that performs what is expected of government:  pro-actively protecting and promoting the welfare of its citizens.  It is an injustice to say that “government” has starved and misallocated tax revenues to the various recipients in the budget.  It is the Republican Party starting with Reagan that labeled government as the problem and private greed and privilege as the solution.  It is the Republican Party and their club used on fearful Democrats (soft on defense) that have poured wasteful trillions into the military that protects the “Nation Interest” far in excess needed to prevent foreign invasion. The Republican Party has repeatedly slashed taxes for privileged individuals- breathing and non-breathing- while running up the largest deficits in history.  There is not enough tax dollars left to maintain society let alone advance it after the privileged feed from the public trough.  Other than Ron DeSantis, the author makes only one other mention of Republicans in general which is not strong enough. Mitch McConnell was not voted in by a national election. Yet he wields the most power on deciding what path the country follows."
2021-06-20 14:03:50,"I remember the initial mask discussion well. Hospitals were not able to get enough ppe including masks, and they were rationed among the front line doctors and nurses, many wearing the same ones day after day. In those early days, we bought masks at our local hardware store and delivered them to a family member who is an intern nearby. If masks had been required for everyone early on, they would have been hoarded like TP and chlorine wipes, and none would have made it to hospital staffs. 

Given that the US was totally unprepared for this pandemic, and our government unwilling to do what needed to be done in the middle of it, our medical community was overwhelmed. 

Our leadership put us in a no-win situation and kept us there far to long."
2021-06-20 14:03:51,"In spite of the huge loss of life and economic carnage caused by Covid-19, I think we have gotten off fairly easily, primarily due to its relatively low fatality rate in healthy people. What are we going to do when some country's ill advised gain-of-function experiment with smallpox, ebola or anthrax escapes from a lab? We have just had our warning."
2021-06-20 14:05:54,"Good article. We’ve got to do better.  My two cents:
—Data functions must be updated. Big money is necessary for specialized tech contractors and permanent staff to supervise.  This means less money available for staff raises and pet projects. Get used to it.  The CDC is nothing without good data. 
—Get rid of the silos and sacred bureaucratic cows.  As far as I can figure, the intransigeance of one highly placed scientist led more or less directly to the early testing debacle.  Can’t blame that on Trump.  Must do better
—Acknowledge reality.  Aerosol transmission was obvious from the early days.  It was not acknowledged until a shamefaced recent Friday evening post to a CDC web site.  This caused lack of focus on ventilation and probably indirectly caused many  deaths.   
—For whatever it is worth, these failures caused me to discount almost entirely CDC advice in my choices about protecting myself.  I wore surgical masks from the earliest days, for example. I can’t be the only one to look to my own reasoning and research abilities in preference to those of the publicly funded experts."
2021-06-19 21:01:12,"Both the CDC and the FDA have undergone extreme politicization.  The CDC bowed to Trump's wishes regarding pandemic advice and the FDA just recently passed an Alzheimer's drug that was shown to have no efficacy in clinical trials and against the advice of the advisory board made up of experts in the field of neurology.  The drug attacks the buildup of amyloid in the brain but so far that has shown not to be the only issue in Alzheimer's Disease.  

Trusted American institutions are failing the American people."
2021-06-20 11:20:41,"As a physician, I will agree and accept the conclusions of this article that the CDC did not perform during this pandemic as we all expected it to perform. I also accept the myriad structural and funding problems that were contributing factors. It is a given that these problems, years in the making, cannot be corrected at the last minute - when a pandemic is upon us.

While long term political decisions produced this, do not discount the effects of the contemporaneous political climate produced by Trump and his actions on this debacle. Trump made everything much worse. The only bright side is that his gross incompetence made enough people vote against him. We are all better off for that."
2021-06-20 11:43:14,"Robert Redfield was completely inept. Under his leadership, the CDC couldn’t even make a test that worked and refused to work with scientists in Washington state, home of one of the first identified outbreaks, who wanted to convert their own tests.

That’s what you get when you make an important appointment to satisfy the religious right instead of to impose scientific rigour."
2021-06-20 11:51:49,"Like any large bureaucracy, CDC shows signs of sclerosis.  But I read this expose mainly as another indication of just how ungovernable this nation has become, and just how is pervasive the impact of malign political polarization."
2021-06-20 11:52:03,"We are still waiting for ACIP to convene their “emergency” meeting examining safety data on the myocarditis side effect from the mRNA vaccines in young people. The meeting was recommended a week and a half ago, was scheduled for this past Friday, and then canceled due to Juneteenth. They will now meet later this week (despite the fact that thousands of teenagers are getting the second doses of their vaccines and many parents are confused about how to best move forward). There seems to be absolutely no sense of urgency with this “emergency” issue.

If the CDC wants to be taken more seriously, they not only need to examine their past mistakes, but get their act together on this present issue as well."
2021-06-20 12:06:44,"It’s not just the CDC. COVID has exposed the failure of just about every government entity. It’s no wonder anti-government sentiment is high.

Maybe that’s how the rich and powerful who detest paying taxes want it. With no faith in your government, you have little expectation of help.

That explains why there was no public uproar over the meager COVID aid we received compared to the aid Europeans enjoyed."
2021-06-20 11:05:33,"Can the CDC explain how Sweden never shut down the elementary schools, never wore masks; and yet had half the deaths per million of Massachusetts where schools were shut down and masks were mandatory even outside? Virtually no Swedish school teachers died of COVID and no Swedish children died of COVID."
2021-06-20 11:34:58,"I think the problem with the CDC occurred because we had a president at that time who did not believe in science. Who while he was in office decimated government organizations funding and cut back on people who were dedicated in working in these organizations. He did not feel these people were necessary because of his beliefs. 

When his Administration came to office, President Obama left detailed binders for every department which wasn't read and ignored as if his cabinet understood what they needed to do. The Obama team left a manual on how to deal with a pandemic because they had to deal with the Ebola outbreak.

I am concerned with loosing the 4 years while he was in office to climate change another one of his disbeliefs we may have reached the tipping point for accelerated global warming."
2021-06-20 11:41:37,"Last Spring, I read the newly released CDC recommendations for places of worship (as part of trying to plan for my congregation's annual holiday open house).  I found the guidelines to be detailed, clear and very helpful.  I printed them..and was so glad I did...because the following day, significant chunks of the document had disappeared.  Specifically, information about why choirs singing in person and communal communion were currently unsafe.  I was bewildered.  Months later it was made public that the person who made those changes/deletions was someone with no public health expertise.  It was Kellyanne Conway.  No White House should have ever ""messed with"" CDC information."

The bigger takeaway is the sheer politicization of a disease and the refusal to have a discussion about option.  Science suddenly became ""The Science"" in an attempt to shut down any meaningful dialogue about the disease.  No doubt one of the drivers behind it all was the villification and ultimate removal of Donald Trump."
2021-06-20 13:43:14,"Accurate reporting, unfortunately.  Each of the problems relating to a politicized, stagnated, and above all, an organization lacking any authority is true, and appear in many other Federal agencies, including one I worked in.  Each problem has no clear solution in our political system.  The sum of the problems is continuing failure.

Certainly, if we had a viable educational system that was responsive to national (and global) need, we might adapt to the outrageous, illogical and fragmented failures; certainly in the pandemic, local common sense and initiative saved lives.  Local ignorance and superstition certainly killed many.  Presidential oversight was simply criminal, murderous. 

The CDC is a powerful machine, kept locked up and turned off, as are the FDA, the EPA and the rest.  Can we fault bright and idealistic scientists for working elsewhere?  Can we fault fearful agency employees, lifers, for being mute when screaming is needed?

The American republic has been an experiment, and like all experiments, has fatal structural issues.  Given time, experience and intelligence, we can structure the next, better one.

I think that, considering the existential threats, we do not have the time."
2021-06-19 21:46:20,"If Federal judges are going to overturn guidance by the CDC during a pandemic, what chance do we have of ever following the science surrounding the pandemic now or in the future?  We either follow the science or we don't."
2021-06-20 09:38:48,"The answer is to separate out the agencies that are responsible for infection disease control and create a whole new agency dedicated to that purpose, and that purpose alone.

The science of virology, bacteriology, vaccines, etc. is evolving so rapidly that only a single agency dedicated to that one purpose among many can meet all the future challenges, and there WILL be future challenges.

As for money this country seems to be able to afford around $400 billion a year for the militiary. That is I am sure many times more than the CDC receives even now, and yet from the point of national defense, the CDC is just as crucial as the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

It can  be called CISD...Center for the Study of Infectious Diseases."

2021-06-20 11:28:25,"I know this is unpopular, but CDC and FDA dysfunction are the expected result of massive overregulation and disincentivizing individual initiative and common sense.

The more complex a regulatory system becomes, the less it is capable of nimbly adapting to situations that are not fitting into the cookie cutter scheme the system has become.  There will always be a rule that will prevent acting in an urgent but unforeseen manner.

It is simple mathematics that dictate such an outcome.

2021-06-20 11:28:47,"I think that the writer, readers and commenters are forgetting an essential fact: this never-before seen virus came from a part of the world not known for its political transparency, then popped up on multiple continents at the same time, and has extreme variation in its presentation from asymptomatic to deadly. It takes time for scientists to figure all this out, publish data in a verifiable form, and come together at the level of public health messaging and action. It also takes, as the writer points out, a political system with the will to make public health more than a footnote in society. No one wants to pour money into research of odd and unlikely diseases until they smack you in the face when you weren’t looking. We can’t go from ignorance to preparedness overnight. CDC and state/local public health departments and research must be seriously refunded, respected, and attract the best and brightest young minds. Our future may depend on it. COVID did at least show us how vulnerable we are, physically, socially, and financially."

The damage to CDC's credibility done by Redfield & Co is substantial and no doubt lasting, and that is the case with a lot of federal institutions in the US.

For the Republican party the C.D.C. is just another devision of the government that should support the goals of the president and the party.  The health and safety of the nation is irrelevant and ""Who cares if they kill an extra 200,000 people during a pandemic"".  If the Republicans think that telling the public to wear masks and remain six feet apart makes them look weak then these suggestions by the C.D.C. are ignored.  When the President suggests that injecting detergents could be an effective way to combat a deadly virus, Republicans want the director of the CDC to nod obediently.  This is the problem facing the C.D.C."

It was obvious by Mar 2020 that the government was going to do every single thing exactly wrong in the pandemic response, and 800,000 deaths was entirely predictable.  We've reached 600,000.  Now, the current CDC director has called a triple reverse on the 5 yard line, and more will die, as the delta variant spreads uncontrolled in the unvaccinated 50% of our population."

Making this a red versus blue thing is not going to get us anywhere--give it up and figure out ""lessons learned"" on how to improve the CDC  and hopefully prevent another catastrophic pandemic."

The CDC will perform better in Massachusetts.  The Universities are better.  The health professionals are better trained.  And, if US medical dominance is compromised again, they will speak out.  In contrast, we haven't heard a peep out of Emory over the last few years.

Yes, the cost of living is higher in Mass., but the American Medical Consumer will receive a better product from the efforts of better trained professionals.

Will this seem petty?  The Republicans didn't seem to complain when the Trump Administration moved thousands of Dept. of Agriculture jobs to Kansas in 2019.  And the Dept. of Agriculture hadn't broken anything.

The CDC, on the other hand, is deeply challenged in this political climate.  They need to get back to medicine, back to patient care, and away from politics.  This will achieve that."

In Canada - our Bureaucracy (Health Canada) recommended a joint project with a Chinese Pharmaceutical for COVID vaccines - sole contract - and we missed ordering Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca vaccines.  Then the Chinese firm reneged on the contract.   We raided the COVEX fund (3rd world supply) for vaccines, and were months behind other countries.

Foremost in this knowledge is that all decisions must be made based on the science and nothing else. Every time in history any other factor has been allowed to have more weight than the science the problem has always been made worse.
The response should have been to quarantine, test and trace and not allow movement until all the multiple testings and tracings which are necessary have been done. The people on cruise ships should have been kept there. Disease is one of the Known downsides of traveling on a ship. 

 Next step find the problem. 

Why was the CDC so clumsy when the very thing it exists for happened? 
The imposition of political dogma on it and all government agencies by the GQP. To ""save money"". I think we all know what they really mean. This caused the changing of personnel and management style at CDC over the last 41 years. Thus they have well educated people ""leading"" teams of minimally qualified people. Thus we had good people who may or may not realize they were in a job whose demands for expertise they could not meet when the time came. Thus these people had no idea they were contaminating the tests they were making as quickly as they could thinking they were accomplishing the mission only because of that ignorance which they were hired for.

It is the a simple fact that government cannot be fixed without republican cooperation.  With analysis and synthesis of political events over past decade it is also obvious that republicans have no interest in fixing our government to be more democratic. The next conclusion iis difficult to accept bur cannot be denied from observations of republican behavior individually and as a party. The conclusion is that they are no longer interested in our democracy and by destroying the democracy they will benefit monetarily and the spoils of uncontested power if they can manage to follow through with their intentions which they have made plainly obvious over the last few years. Citizens do not want to accept obvious negative outcome republican unrestrained power. It is more comfortable to reject what is before their eyes.

They can’t have it both ways.

Our CDC allowed teachers unions to meddle in its reopening guidance, resulting in recommendations that were stricter than what the agency had planned and what the science indicates.

There are 100's of epidemiologists and virologists who are on the payroll either directly or through grants. They had no plan to save our lives? No protocols in place! Don't put the blame on our politicians. Enough money has been available for half a century. I met Fauci in the1980's at an Infectious Disease conferences during the Aids outbreak. He's been around over 50 years!
As stated in this article why weren't there Covid outbreaks in hospitals? The reason is simple. Hospitals have had Infectious Control Committees  for the 50 years I've been working. One Infectious Control RN with a year or 2 of extra training who carries out standard infection control  protocols and educates the staff. Her(his) salary $70,000 a year. No virologist or epidemiologist needed. In the old days a simple primary care physician like myself was chairman of a Committee that met monthly. The ""Scientific Method"" hasn't changed. Infection control has been around since before ""The Plague."" The nursing homes with greedy owners and inept administrators is 
another story!
If our hospitals can control the spread of infections surely the MD's, PHD's and those scientists in Ivory Towers could have saved just a few of the 600,000 lives lost!"

They failed to partner with the many genius scientists and epidemiologists in our country. They went for the press releases and interviews. 
Trump realized the false information he was getting and tried to move to other more knowledgeable individuals but the media, who had this vengeance mentality rather than their proper role as fact finders, blew that to pieces. The political apparatus was more interested in making Trump look foolish, than admitting he was right. Fauci et al were Wrong! 
It’s an awful fact to admit but it’s true. The politicized leaders of the CDC and the NIH coup,Ed with a faulty press led us astray. History will reveal that quite clearly. 
We let the political, power hungry leaders lead us down a terrible path that will take many years for us to pay for. We lost too many innocent people because of political decisions not health decisions.

2021-06-20 12:26:33,"It is outrageous to blame the CDC for its initial response to C19 when the orange elephant did everything he could to destroy the message and ruin the credibility of the messengers. Anything which might interfere with his economic grift had to be denigrated, or ignored. There is plenty of blame remaining for the Reaganites for whom the Government, including the CDC, is the problem. Starve the beast they said, instead feed the CEOs who in turn stuffed Republican pockets.
Don't expect any golden nuggets of data to magically drop of EMR (computer record systems) systems. They were designed to optimize billing and legal mandates, not to improve medical care. Physicians as a group viscerally despise these systems because of the huge clerical burden they place on caregivers. Do you really think those caregivers are going to do even more extra work to ensure accuracy of data when just cutting and pasting boiler plate already takes 80% of their day!
Finally, the author appears to have the odd expectation that the CDC should have had all the answers just as C19 hit our shores. This is a disease whose clinical course in patients can run several months.  The post-hoc NGOs and others mentioned started much later and had the benefitted of months of additional data collected from hundreds of thousands of patients.
And yes, the CDC was absolutely bone-headed obstinate in NIH (not invented here) attitude regarding viral testing."
2021-06-20 12:27:10,"To be honest I haven’t seen any evidence that the CDC was too harsh.   Sure … everyone wants to enjoy society and the economy.  We know that.  It’s self evident.

But rewriting nature’s rules and science to suit the desires of mankind is like pushing a rope.  All the whining in the world isn’t going to change fact.

Yes - things could have been done faster and better for sure.  Done so without the pressure of politicians and zealots crying to get THEIR way …."
2021-06-20 12:29:34,"Repairs to the CDC began January 20, when repairs on any number of government agencies began.
The policy of weaponizing both the pandemic and the steps needed to fight it, like the weaponization of the Department of Justice, the FCC, FBI, ICE, and the areas they are responsible for began to be fixed, simply by the removal of a president who wanted to be a banana republic dictator, as a permanent job and personal source of wealth.
Just enough people correctly answered the old rhetorical Marx Brothers question “who are you going to believe me or your eyes?” to end the madness in Washington.
The problem was, and remains, that tens of millions more still won’t believe their eyes.
They still believe anything their government does is evil - a GOP trope that goes back to Reagan’s constant claim the worst thing to hear is “I’m from the government and I’m here to help you.”
‘Fear the people you elect!’ he said.
Now just why would the government be looking to hurt you? The line just was delivered as a gag, a poor one for it made no sense, but the concept caught on and began blinding millions to the fact the GOP government was there to help the wealthy, but not those whose only power was the vote.
Trump finished that one off, convincing them their votes didn’t count either.
Those lies will take a long time to heal.
The mind if the nation has been severely damaged, and its right hemisphere remains inflamed and blinded to reality."
2021-06-20 12:32:05,"This article makes scapegoats out of government agencies, including public education, and claims that there are simple solutions to control of the COVID pandemic in schools. The arguments are hollow,

The CDC was operating under an ignorant tyrant who the agency could not rely on for support, in fact quite the opposite.
Comparing schools to hospitals is indigenous at best. Schools are woefully under-funded. How could they afford the resources and protocols suggested? Hospitals are set up for disease control; staff are medically trained. The environment was designed for cleanliness long before the pandemic. Even non-medical personnel have an ongoing understanding of preventing spreading of disease.
Schools, especially in the south, have cut spending for art, music, physical education. Where would the money for safety and health measures come from when ignorant, anti-science legislators have  ignored the needs of education for decades?  Parents would have to be trained in protocols for the other 16 hours of the day and weekends when they control the environment and actions of their children.
Irresponsible people like Trumpies who don’t believe in simple protocols and are anti-vaccine likely will over-ride initiatives in the schools.
Given that it’s a vexing problem, articles like this are of no help."
2021-06-20 12:46:23,"This is rther a muddle in terms of information.  Apparently, the CDC has significant organizational problems   -- in terms of computer systems, how funds are allowed to be used (from the top allocation does not nec. address the needs at the bottom.) 

So far as the pandemic... is it finally over??  I guess we will find out. We did get a vaccine in record time.. about nine months.. less than a year most of us survived (and some of whatever the number of deaths - reported and unreported -- would have occured in any case. Old people do that - pass on!)  

In NYC lots of us are still wearing masks indoors and even outdoors (because we are used to them and when we're too hot and remember we put them under our chins.)  That colds and seasonal flu were also down, masks and the suspension of dense gatherings.. we'll see wht happens again soon.  

Forget the CDC.  The real shame politically - Trump and Biden and CONGRESS -- is that the American people didn't get Single Payer Universal Healthcare as a result of the pandemic.  But Capitlaism is alive and well and the efforts of the government go into assuring that the rich get richer and the poor   -- well only the poor pay taxes.  (Biden capitulated on raising taxes for the rich.. and seems to think it's OK for people earning less than 50K to pay 22% in federal taxes.

BTW American tourists can only travel with the perission of the nation state they are entering.. nothing to do with the CDC per se."
2021-06-20 14:02:30,"We are not a healthy country.    The CDC like many other government agencies  does a poor job art best.    Let's look at some of our health problems.

1)    For years before anything was done against smoking the government knew that smoking was killing people but business intrests ran the show.  ( as they do today)   

2)   Both obesity and diabetes are extremely serious yet they are totally  ignored by the CDC.

3)  For years fat was regarded as a bad food.   Now we know better but low-fat food is still pushed on the American people to the extent it is sometimes difficult to find real food.      

4)  The wic program does not allow people to buy whole milk for children.   

5)   HFCS  causes obesity and it is ignored.    

6) Aspartame is a poison.  

7)   Round up is routinely used to kill wheat before harvest and it winds up in the wheat where ( in spite of the Delaney Clause)  we consume it.     The same goes for GMOI corn.  

Many of our so called health issues come from the government selling us the cheapest foods possible.    But cheapest foods also means higest profits.    That is why  it is the poor that are the most obease.   

There is much to answer for."
2021-06-20 14:09:49,"“…during the Trump administration, agency leaders stood by while politicians and political appointees repeatedly undermined the agency’s staff. Scientific reports were blocked or altered. Quarantine powers were used to achieve political goals. Dangerous strategies for controlling the virus were not only promoted but actively employed.”

Perhaps the relevant question is can our broken and corrupt political leadership be fixed? I cannot imagine trusting an R nominee ever again given them serving up Donny and his motorcycle gang."
2021-06-20 14:10:14,"The C.D.C. is not broken, contrary to the thrust of this article. The problem is twofold. First, the leadership of the C.D.C. was politicized by Donald Trump and his closest advisors. Second, the C.D.C. does have an awkward way of delivering messages.

When a health crisis is as complex, deadly, variable and subtle as Covid-19, public recommendations do not fit on bumper stickers. The C.D.C. should not try to simplify its answers to journalists who want their questions to be a lead story on the evening news."
2021-06-20 14:26:05,"The truth about Covid is that nations which closed their borders and undertook intensive contact-tracing efforts as soon as they detected their first cases were able to contain the virus. Nations which chose to delay suffered the consequences. Yet even as China shut Wuhan down and infections began appearing on our soil we were told, by the WHO and by our own epidemiologists, that such control measures were ineffective, xenophobic and economically horrendous. So we dallied.

It’s fair to acknowledge that experts were basing their opinions on earlier experience with the “Hong Kong” flu of 1968 and the H1N1 of 2009, whence pandemic spread through the respiratory route was deemed inevitable once an agent had escaped its initial case cluster. But we can’t just blame it all on Trump. The June 2020 open letter from the public health advocates declaring white supremacy the greater threat damaged the credibility establishment physicians had enjoyed up to then; the ensuing mystique of masks in the great outdoors was almost as political as any of the Mike Caputo bully acts at the CDC. Nicholas Kristof’s editorial campaign to reopen the schools came on the heels of NY Times reporting on the outbreak that swept Utah’s Corner Canyon High.

If there’s a lesson here, it’s teaching us the scant regard that microbes will offer the narratives we want to construct around them."
2021-06-20 00:01:00,"No peace time system survives the first battle without needing to make changes. Now at least it is more obvious what needs to be fixed. 

And the truth is that even if the CDC had been perfect in its response to covid, I'm not sure it would have made all that much of a difference. Last March California, and especially San Francisco, were still able to make the important decisions that limited the spread of covid initially. Other places that didn't, like New York, failed for mostly political/psychological reasons. The recommendations on face masks, while wrong, were not unreasonable given the shortage at the time. And I doubt that the mask -- and later vax -- deniers would have been any more receptive in April of 2020 then they were later. Even the Holiday Season surge was the result, not of bad advice, but of people choosing to do what they should have know was not a good idea in 2020. You can't fund away stupidity.

And given their disjointed computer system, there is at least no chance of their whole system being taken over by a ransomware attack."
2021-06-20 12:06:02,"Of course Science failed us nearly as much as the Republicans and Trump.  If they had tested and quarantined early and fast hundreds of thousands of people would probably have been saved. Their hubris in not accepting the World Health Organization's offer of a Covid-19 test in favor of their own CDC test was a gigantic failure.  If you recall, their test failed and was unreliable. They took two weeks to admit their test failed and they had forced the entire health community, all the major Universities and commercial labs to not use the tests they were developing.  And the county and state health services were not permitted to use their own tests but were ordered to ""send their samples for testing into CDC. ""  Their tests failed. No one was traced and quarantined.  They watched Asian nations stop the spread rapidly because they had good tests and firm commitment to their people along with decent health systems. Then Trump lied, and lied, and the people of America died and died, and the CDC would not oppose the ""Government""  ignoring their responsibility to the People! The Republican philosophy that money is more valuable than people took precedent over the Hippocratic oath, scientific honesty, and the precedence for truth. Science failed almost as much as the Republicans. And whoever showed courage and spoke up wasn't supported by their ""superiors"".  That failure cost  hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.   je accuse! We all should accuse and repair our wounded Nation."
2021-06-20 12:45:50,"""The C.D.C. seemed incapable of answering these questions.""....Actually, it would seem more apt to say that some people are incapable of listening."
2021-06-20 12:55:40,Doubtful that the CDC can recover. It’s a seriously tarnished institution.
2021-06-20 14:10:22,"Are there lessons to be learned from the reformation of FEMA post-Katrina? Much like the CDC, it interacts with states, it has to be prepared for quickly arising, complex events and it is responsible for providing information for action directly to the public. Leadership counts!"
2021-06-20 14:22:49,The military budget is $720 billion. CDC’s budget is $15.4 billion. Covid has killed more US citizens than have died in all the wars we have fought In the last hundred years. We have been fighting the wrong war.
2021-06-20 11:43:52,"In Michael Lewis' The Premonition: A Pandemic Story, Lewis points out that the head of the CDC is a political appointee. Since a PA is usually a political toady, serving at the whim of the POTUS, and can be fired by tweet, it seems to me that the leader of the CDC should be a position that has more job security, independent of a whimsical president."
2021-06-20 12:43:44,"Taking the article at face value, what it describes is just generalized incompetence: not being able to interpret public health research papers, etc. That's not about politics. 
Reading stories like this every day in the Times about yet another corrupt and/or incompetent element of American society makes me wonder if maybe there's a bigger underlying problem."
2021-06-20 13:04:23,"Suggested read to understand this and other issues regarding our (it’s not “the government,” it’s “our government” - in our democracy the the government is us) government and in particular our government agencies which we employ to protect us:

“Captured:  the Corporate Infiltration of American Democracy” by Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.

Particular attention (in terms of the CDC) to the chapter on:

“Capture of the Regulatory Agencies”

It’s worth the read.  Though it’s stomach turning, it’s important to better understand the underlying, often hidden, causes behind actions our government and our agencies take (or don’t take).

We are often discussing only the symptoms of issues - the headlines.

If we want to keep our democracy, we need to spend the time to look at underlying causes."
2021-06-20 14:09:19,"as a practicing RN of over twenty years experience, in my opinion basic problems at CDC need to be addressed:
inability to deliver an accurate, rapid test for covid (despite the tests availability- cdc refused to purchase it and botched the in house development of a test).
CDC's refusal to enact/reccomend basic infection control measures to the states (test, quarantine the positives, isolate).
a topheavy gigantic bureaucracy that is too large to do basic missions.
the response to the spanish flu in 1918 was more effective than the current clown show response to covid-19."
2021-06-20 14:12:21,"As a medical practitioner for over 30yrs, I am disappointed in the CDC but have not completely lost faith. The CDC can be a valuable source of information but doctors need to use their own judgement and scientific knowledge to made medical decisions that are in the best interest of their patients. One of the areas in which I believe the CDC has failed is surveillance of covid mutations where we discovered other countries were tracking variants and our supposed world leading CDC was not. Most recently the CDC has offered no guidance and so far recommended against testing antibody response to the vaccines for COVID-19. Consequently, likely millions of vaccinated Americans are being told not wear masks or social distancing with the assumption that the vaccines have elicited the expected antibody response. The fact is that may not be true and the only tool we have— antibody testing confirming spike protein development— is not being used to identify those who remain at risk for infection even though they have been vaccinated. I disagree and have been testing and my data suggests it would be valuable to have this testing to confirm response in all patients."
2021-06-20 15:19:52,"Micheal Lewis has written ""Premonition"" An amazing tale of the development of pandemic planning, and the failure of the CDC and our government to implement their guidelines in a timely manner. It also gives a quality look into how dysfunctional the CDC is. If you like horror stories told at the expense of your health I highly recommend the book."
2021-06-20 15:20:03,"The problem with the CDC is that it has too many goals.  The agency needs to be reorganized and split up.  The US needs a massive rapid response team for disease outbreaks. The CDC is that in the public imagination but nowhere near that in reality.  The rapid response team should be lead by someone who is a leader in emergency response and logistics management who may or may not be a physician. The research functions of the CDC should be handed over to the NIH. and the regulatory functions over to the Surgeon General’s office which should be greatly expanded and refocussed.

There is no way to keep politics out of what the CDC does so it should be made an explicitly political body overseen by political appointees from both parties like the FCC or the Federal Reserve is. Only political appointees will have the power and political support to protect the technical staff. 

When a body like the CDC makes decisions like a rental eviction moratorium, which is traditionally the realm of legislatures, it is inviting political interference."
2021-06-20 15:21:41,"Epidemiology as a profession and the CDC have their core advisory credibility almost entirely, with former President putting the final nails in the coffin, not based on faulty scientific information, but rather translating that scientific information into timely action beneficial to the American public.

The CDC function needs to be detached from the  federal political apparatus, and managed by management professionals, definitely not epidemiologists, or the next health crisis we all may pay a much higher price than the current disaster we are experiencing worldwide.

But no sense of urgency is evident at all."
2021-06-20 15:22:02,"The article sounds an alarm not only on the CDC but also on an array of Federal agencies that play a role in the health  and safety of the American public.  Consider the FAA: underfunding of its regulatory branches has led to widespread delegations of authority to the very entities it is supposedly regulating.  Would two 737 Max crashes have happened had Boeing been required to fully detail the realities of the 737 Max design to the FAA?  Allowing Boeing to become in effect an independent fiefdom just beyond the reach of its Federal regulator bore the avoidable but, under the circumstances, inevitable outcome. If we are really serious about public health and safety there must be a better way to fund and manage these mission-critical agencies, not just the CDC and the FAA but others as well, the NIH and the National Weather Service (let us not forget ""Sharpiegate"") to name two."
2021-06-20 15:26:58,"The CDC exists in a free fire zone with the agency - and probably most of it's employees -  trying to execute its mission despite having insufficient backing from Congress. Political appointees owe allegiance to their boss, instead of to the public. And the public has supported too many pols who do not value healthcare, but only their  campaign donors.  

The job of enlisting the cooperation of states and local HDs was never simple, even when the US had  a much smaller population. Read accounts of the groundwork done to engineer the rollout of the Salk vaccine.  It wasn't done by fiat, but by bringing leaders at the different levels together. 

We just have to be sure that the reforms are not made solely as a reaction to the Trump's mishandling( of everything,).

And as a ""mature"" and giant bureaucracy, some issues in dysfunction come from that in itself."
2021-06-20 15:29:09,The numerous deficiencies in the CDC reflect a bigger and deeper national problem: fixing the political system.  The article can apply quite easily to many other federal (and state) agencies; you just have to replace CDC by the appropriate  name.
2021-06-20 15:31:16,"There is a lot of blame to go around, but the biggest root cause is national and state political gamesmanship that does not revolve around health but pandering for votes and power."
2021-06-20 15:38:00,"The issues outline in this article do not go far enough. I'll address just one of them. Occupation as a source of spreader events is barely mentioned, race and class is not. N95 respirators are not mentioned. Production & primary sector workers never had the luxury of working from home and self-isolating themselves & families.
Occupational & Environmental Scientists struggled from day one to get CDC to recognize airborne transmission recognized & emergency production of N95 started. Yet CDC clung to the antiquated droplet theory, reserving N95 only for hospital clinical procedures.
Even today, CDC blocked OSHA from promulgating a comprehensive Emergency Temporary Standard for all workers, reserving it only for healthcare workers. One of the reasons for this is  the American Hospital Association's exercising an over-weighted political influence on the CDC.
These problems are not endemic to the US. Canada & the UK have faced similar problems, and these two countries have socialized medicine.
A simple calculation using W.H.O. data shows that for the whole pandemic period, the US has the highest per capita rate of any major nation, 5.4x the international rate.Canada is 1.6x the international average. Yet the US & Canada are supposed to be advanced economies. It will take a lot more than integrated computer systems at CDC to fix the national health crisis."
2021-06-20 15:44:22,"Thank you for this very informative article.  But what a nightmare!!!  I truly think that states' independence and power have gone too far when the very institution we have charged with protecting us from public health crises can be ignored and overruled and siphoned for money by each state.  As a former civil servant, I know exactly the state of our computerized information structure, and it is just as bad as described, due to outdated machinery and the practice of having outside contractors (different from organization to organization) design the applications used to store and communicate information.  There really is no priority for allowing departments, or agencies, share information.  And as a Floridian, I know first hand how ""Dr. DeSantis"" led our state, and almost half its population, down the path of ""it's nothing to worry about.  Business comes first."""
2021-06-20 15:54:56,"Some great comments, recommendations, and suggested readings herein.  I’ll add another: there is a organizational discipline called “Enterprise Architecture” (EA) which (ideally) begins at the organization charter and mission statement, then derives policy from those, and then processes to execute those policies.  From that the departments, and systems required to perform those processes can be defined.  A well documented EA informs leadership and decision makers about the who, what, when, where, and how of their organization.  Formal EA is expensive to develop but, yet again demonstrably, so is not having one; the CDC might greatly benefit from the investment."
2021-06-20 15:55:24,"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned that, prior to our current crisis, the CDC has really botched Lyme disease (which is still poorly understood) and even more heinously the pain management crisis.  Doctors are terrified of prescribing opioids even to well-documented cases of chronic pain, and even worse are reluctant to prescribe pain management to end-stage cancer patients.  Everyone will need pain management at some point in their lives, and right now there is incredible suffering.  In addition, untreated pain means that people cannot work and this adds to the nation's economic burden of people on disability/Medicaid.  Yes, the CDC has a page on responsible prescribing, but doctors are not following it.  Instead of allowing the DEA to criminalize doctors who try to help patients, the CDC should be at the forefront of punishing doctors who refuse to treat patients' pain.  Remember, no one gets out of here alive.  You may be the next person who needs pain management."
2021-06-20 16:02:19,"The CDC needs to move away from basic science research and focus on disease prevention and treatment. Fundamental research is better done at Universities. Bang-for-buck, it's been known by scientists that national labs are terrible at managing funds. One only has to compare University achievements in the past 30 years with national labs and the funds allocated to each."
2021-06-20 16:08:00,"We need to go back to a time when medicine was largely non profit. That is the reason CDC and other entities are politicized. That is why cost has spiraled of of hand. 2019, 4.5 trillion. The insurance system is unnecessary, although, them taking 2% is not much, (=the cost of 30,000 MRI machines)."
2021-06-20 16:08:38,"Lest anyone doubt the cause of the CDC's many problems, the basic issue is that any large federal agency is excessively political and totally incapable of scientific endeavors.   If the CDC is to function as it did at the beginning of its mandate, its function should be to coordinate how the nation responds to disease threats not to investigate them.  That's something done much more efficiently in university laboratories where science is at least as important as politics."
2021-06-20 16:09:42,"Band-aid approach/analysis.

The elephant in the room was and remains the politics of the situation. Nothing more, nothing less.

Part of this, the context, is the lack of a national healthcare system in the US, which is reflective of a complete lack of community across the nation's citizenry. 'Public health' and 'private health' are flip sides of the same coin.

Fix the nation, at every broken level, and you fix the problem 'addressed' in this op-ed.

Or not. End of story."
2021-06-20 16:24:24,"IMHO there is a systemic element as well (FEMA also has it). Which is over-reliance on tick-box 'best practice' procedures rather than professional judgement.

In relatively stable situations there nothing wrong with supermarket-chain like processes.

In crises (for which the CDC and FEMA are supposed to be experts), especially time-critical ones, fixed procedures cannot, by definition be enough.

Making judgements means taking calculated risks, that's what leadership is about ... so, one has to ask, how much has the USA's (and now the UK's) litigious environment stifled decision-making?

Can, in this environment, the CDC ever be 'pandemic ready'?

Thanks for reading."
2021-06-20 10:34:39,"The point is missed that, had Redfield, a blatantly political director, not been in his position, and the CDC were to have been left to its usual operations, with NO political interference from Trump and the hacks at HHS, the infection might not have taken such terrible toll here. But HHS, Redfield and, worst of all, Donald Trump, who advocated injecting bleach, meddled in medical advice - an area of which they were ignorant (yes, Redfield, too) and caused the death of thousands - needlessly.

“Masks are not needed!” Then “Masks are required!”  Then “Double mask!”

Another- the CDCs unwillingness to acknowledge that COVID is airborne until THIS spring, when it was obvious to anyone who could read a newspaper that it was airborne LAST spring.

The CDC’s test failures.

The moving goalposts on herd immunity.

We need to fire people. The fact is we don’t do that enough. 

How many generals were fired due to their performance in Afghanistan? Iraq? None, both wars that we lost. Ridiculous.

Yes, the CDC faced resource constraints and a lack of attention. And yes, the scientific process is slow and uncertain.

2021-06-20 12:44:34,"CDC has also bungled the opioid crisis. CDC attempted informal regulation to stop the use of the 4000 year old pain medicines, opiates (opioids) our only real pain killers. CDC believed opiates “too dangerous to use” and “don’t work” - an absurdity. CDC falsely believed not prescribing opiates would stop overdose deaths. It failed. Overdose deaths are up and so are the number of Americans suffering without pain medicines. Doctors are afraid of governmental retribution for “overprescribing”, a false premise to start with, but arrests continue of community physicians. 

Having practiced 40 years I can tell you opiates work well for pain. I have only seen one person addict. Pain is not an illusion. CDC guidelines for pain treatment for 10 million rare painful disease patients whispers “taper” 42 times. The suffering of 5-7 million with intractable medical disease is unimaginable, 10 times worse than the opioid crisis itself.

The rest of you without these awful incurable diseases are unlikely to get pain medicine after surgery or in the ER. Call your hospital and ask.

The unauthorized CDC opioid guidelines must be suspended at once - pending congressional review. The half hearted CDC mea culpa April, 2019 failed to stop the national forced tapering program. 

In June 2020 an alarmed AMA sent a letter to CDC “many patients are being harmed. CDC ignored it - did nothing,

2021-06-20 14:56:01,"I worked in a big city health department largely funded by CDC as a disease control Director in the division of disease control. This reporter misses a quite fundamental point.While blaming system after system for CDC’s failures, it doesn’t point a finger at individuals. President Harry Truman famously stated, “The buck stops here.“ Remember?

CDC put a 20 year birth defect expert PhD nurse in charge of describing ventilation requirements for opening schools. It put a violence prevention psychologist, violence prevention economist, an automobile injury prevention expert in charge of describing how to open restaurants and bars. These individuals wrote the articles describing those topics in JAMA in just the past two months, with Dr. Walensky running the agency. A former AIDS expert with a lapsed medical certification, so he is no longer certified in anything, has directed the national response to COVID-19. 

Some CDC scientists will respond to emails and phone calls from external experts. Dr. Walensky herself and the rest have CDC’s Director of Homeland Security return the call.

CDC has long struggled with its Georgia plantation culture, which says “I may not be the expert but I’m the boss.“ Humility and modesty are intrinsic to public health, as they are to science and medicine. But at CDC now, too many are beating their chest as “Disease Detectives”. That this article mentions not one current CDC scientist by name makes clear its failing."

The CDC is an outcome of the three.

The prior director's only function was to do nothing or at least block anything that could be described as doing something, on direct orders from Trump.

A self directed mess to grift"

Time for a redo."
2021-06-20 13:47:35,"To me, the biggest disappointment was when the CDC couldn't keep track of basic Covid data. I remember the spring day last year when I looked at their Web page and saw the horrible formatting and how delayed the reports were. It was not surprising that somebody--here, The Atlantic journalists, who frankly deserve a Pulitzer for their work--realized nobody was filling the data gap and took it over.

Perhaps the CDC should hire The Atlantic folks to show them how to collect basic data on infections, hospitalizations, ventilator and ICU use, and mortality by state.  I'm not joking; I'm dead serious. The Atlantic pulled it off for a year and the whole organization deserves a Pulitzer.

Unless you have basic counts of what is important and measurable, you can't begin to fix a system."
2021-06-20 14:55:12,"Although Trump's name appears three times in this lengthy article, it would seem that he might have earned quite a bit more credit for CDC failures than the article indicates."
2021-06-20 14:57:40,"The failures of the CDC can be laid at the feet of the man most responsible for them: Dr. Redfield. His abject cowardice to stand up to the ignorance and selfishness of President Trump and the Republican party was disgraceful. I realize being the leader of a National Lab is a cushy job, but these people need to realize that they serve the American people, NOT the politicians. If that means they lose their job speaking out against the ignorance and self-serving actions of politicians, so be it. To meekly stand by and try to keep their jobs while politicians utter ignorant (and dangerous) diatribes in the guise of ""science"" is something no scientist should ever allow. Even though he would have been immediately fired for going against Trump, that action alone would have been of more service to the American people than anything Dr. Redfield did while cowering in Trump's shadow."

2021-06-19 02:47:21,"I think it is interesting that the article starts off with describing the CDC as the worlds premier public health agency.

The biggest problem is that a lot of Americans believe that to be true - leading to the arrogance to believe that solutions not coming from the CDC are not to even be evaluated.

If the US were to start learning from other countries, we would be a heck of a lot further ahead.

Second problem is the stupidity cult focused on a Non-science/Qanon sabotaging public debate and a chance to actually eradicate Covid through getting the entire population vaccinated."
2021-06-20 12:51:41,"Listen to the politicians who are in touch with their people. The influencers, as they are rightfully called. Do the Do Gooders really think people want to hear from them?  People want a solution without paying for it. The right brained people think they are constantly being cheated by the establishment/government. Cheated in that their tax dollars are wasted because those dollars are not spent as they think they should be spent. This country is really financially broke. A Come to Jesus time is just around the corner, phrased so the right brained people will understand this sentence."
2021-06-20 13:48:44,"In the last two decades alone we have seen several stark examples of where robust federal agencies are required in order to protect the lives of American citizens and the functioning of our society. From FEMA to the CDC, they are not agencies draped in glamor during normal times, but when we need them, we *really* need them. This ought to underline the stupidity of voting people into public office who believe that government can never be a solution, and should be starved away to near zero with the goal of cutting taxes for the wealthy. How about taking a chunk out of that bloated military budget and using it for the benefit of our society?"
2021-06-20 14:46:15,"This article exposes one of the most serious threats to our nation, that is the propagation of untruth and the rejection of science.  This trend was exacerbated by the previous administration and the CDC was decimated.  In order to undue this damage, we must re-establish what is true, what is real and how science works.  If we cannot move back toward true open minded questioning and answering of our world, we will return to the blind religious world of the Dark Ages with all of the accompanying evils of book burning, witch hunts and murder of non-believers.  There is a substantial portion of our current population who are already there, they must be made to understand the absolute evil in their belief system and the damage it will cause to our society."

Not good, not a democracy, and definitely not ""United."""
2021-06-20 15:07:48,"I think getting rid of the current leadership will be an essential step in a ""truth and reconciliation"" process.

I thought we would pull together in a time of harm. I trusted those that were charged with protecting me. Now I have to reprogram 65 years of false faith. What big blinders I wore. No wonder I’m depressed. The lesson learned is that when it comes to your own health, protection, education, etc. we are all on our own."
2021-06-20 15:17:19,"In terms of its bureaucratic inertia and related matters, I suspect that the CDC is just like any other cabinet- or sub-cabinet level agency of the USG, although not nearly as corrupt.  

I'd  love to see a write up like this on the State Department.  

Even though the work of State is not a fraction as important as that of the CDC, NYT readers would be appalled."
2021-06-20 15:42:24,"There is not much that can be done to assure that bureaucrats can serve the public interests when elected representatives are determined to obstruct them to serve their peculiar constituents who want to prevent what upsets their private agendas. 

Republicans left the reasoning parts of their brains to idleness and to atrophy long ago. They just want to pretend that the world will be as they want if they just make up lies and tell stories that contradict reality. When they are in office, pandemics and climate change will run wild while they do nothing reasonable to address them."

2021-06-20 16:05:56,"Our noble but starved CDC comes across like a beached whale: heavy, slow, and unresponsive; a giant hobbled by ropes of red tape so tight they cut right into it and make it fragmentary.

The CDC is burdened by having responsibility without authority. The institution is torn apart by the conflict between the politics and profit-making of private corporate interests, and safeguarding the public health of American tax payers.

It’s a bit of a schizophrenic existence.

Like sentinels, corporate lobbyists guard every space of the CDC’s chain of command. Even worse, federal and state interests often clash.

The obvious erosion of the CDC’s previous prowess is the direct result of the neoliberal financialization of the United States over the last forty years, as the country devolves into an oligarchy increasingly alien to democracy and the common good.

Unlike other advanced, rich, capitalist social democracies, the United States is a nation founded on profit, private wealth, and world dominion. Societal issues will always come second.  

We need to recognize this before we can move forward.

Then after people die, entire states have been devastated, economies crushed, the nation morns, more ‘thoughts and prayers,’ then comes the usual response: finger pointing, politicization, congressional hearings, restructuring and growth coupled with massive new spending bills.

And no one can really say with any degree of confidence they’ve actually been fixed"
2021-06-20 15:19:13,The CDC was similarly vague in its press releases about the infectious nature of Ebola when that deadly disease occured in West Africa several years ago  So the internal problems at the CDC were already there.  But the CDC's contradictory messaging to the public in their official announcements regarding Covid was something else altogether.  Sadly I do not entirely trust the CDC anymore.  It is particularly infuriating because the anti-vacc people were thrilled the CDC could not create a coherent message about Covid.
2021-06-20 15:47:12,"Thank you for a very well written article!  The outbreak and the public health response was a catastrophe ; the author has pointed out several key reasons why. It has been a perfect storm of macro level ignorance of what public health is and the long term investment that is needed, a lack of understanding of the difference between a guideline and a rule, intentionally fomented hatred toward government, and a lot of old, arrogant thinking within the agency. I really like Friedan’s idea of having CDC do tours with state and local health departments. How about also having CDC staff do tours with high tech companies and universities, so that they not only are tuned into local needs but also stay up to date on technology?  Fax machines?"
2021-06-20 16:00:46,"Up-front disclaimer: the following comment is based on my anecdotal experience and not any scientific research

That said, I believe this article confirms why my two children, who are in their late 30s, have little to no confidence in our government and its agencies to make our lives better. They are so disillusioned with the system as it is now, that they actually see no difference between the Trump administration and the Biden administration! And I believe they represent the views of many of their contemporaries.

What's worse, when I ask them to propose a solution for our broken government, they have none."
2021-06-20 15:04:52,"How about a Covid Rapid Response Working Group type leadership at the top of the CDC org board on the medical delivery end, and an Amazon-like organizing and logistical group, with satellite groups in every state, to create the lines of command and communication and organization, all authorized and funded by Congress, is what is needed. It's clear that public health, like interstate commerce and national defense, is a federal responsiblity, and if the pretext for that is not present in the constitution, then it needs an amendment. Pandemic disease, global warming, nuclear proliferation, governance of the poles and oceans and space, and probably even ufo's and asteroid defense all require international organization along the same lines. If we care about humanity and life on earth, we need to get serious about mending our ways,and getting rid of the attitude. In every Greek drama, hubris...pride, arrogance, or should we call it willful ignorance...is what destroys the man, woman and state. Of hubris, there is a glut in this world."
2021-06-20 15:25:11,"CDC was broken far before Covid-19. They have missed the boat on Acute Lyme, Chronic Lyme, Co-infections of Lyme for too many decades to keep counting."
2021-06-20 15:40:35,"The most recent error was the recommendation that people who had been vaccinated need not wear masks. This would have been appropriate if the average American was a rational scientist like the average CDC researcher, i.e. rational and honest. Obviously those who feel both masks and vaccine are political tools of an oppressive government will simply take off his mask and assume that people will think he is vaccinated.

I heard a Republican mayor point out that it would have made more sense to recommend that cities and states drop the mask mandate when 70% of their population was immune to COVID by vaccination or illness. This would have created peer pressure on those who are not vaccinated to get the shot and help the community meet the requirement."
2021-06-20 15:02:53,"It’s an exaggeration to claim the CDC is ‘broken’. The US hasn’t seen a global a pandemic in 100 years.  The population of the country, meanwhile, has grown from 100M to 360M. There are bound to be thorny problems no matter what the preparation. The reason people think the CDC is in disarray is because Trump, Rand Paul, and other crazy republicans have been leveling false accusations since the pandemic began and have turned COVID into a carnival."
2021-06-20 15:07:37,"I'm surprised and disappointed that the article did not once speak to the coordination or lack thereof between CDC and the NIAIA of NIH, Dr. Fauci's office. Therein may lie the crux of the bureaucratic muddle."
2021-06-20 15:21:32,"Hindsight is 20/20. One of the things Fauci said that makes a lot of sense is that what needs to be done will change when new information becomes available. And since a global pandemic is obviously not a simple matter to deal with in a dysfunctional country of 330 million... The CDC's response was disappointing, but not surprising to me. And Trump and his clown-car administration undermined the CDC, too.

Two things should have been done (which I suggested to the CDC via e-mail and wrote on this site in April '20) are 1) top-of-the-line masks needed to be manufactured and distributed to all Americans by July '20, and 2) ventilation systems in office and apt buildings, malls and schools needed to be assessed and improved to minimize exposure and allow for a faster econamic reopening. Alas, my common sense suggestions have not and will not happen."
2021-06-20 14:42:27,"We need to rethink some things. Period. The last four years have exposed much naïveté, many vulnerabilities, weaknesses.

2021-06-20 14:48:09,"This analysis of the CDC's failings reads depressingly like the problems around the intelligence and law enforcement community's failings and mobilization efforts during the 1/6 insurrection at the Capitol.  Too many agencies with competing agendas unable to either forestall an emergency or effectively combat it when it actually happens for the same reasons.  Yes, underfunding is a problem for the CDC.  But the roadblocks outlined in the article go beyond that to an organization that simply can't function as an interconnected whole, either within itself or society at large.

The pandemic is the medical equivalent of war.  You don't win wars with a poorly funded, badly organized agency that has no enforcement powers.  Nor do you win wars trying to get 50 states to behave as if they belong to the same country.  That's why we have 600,000 dead (and counting) to mourn.  If this were an actual invasion how do you think we'd fare?  Not well, as the 1/6 insurrection proved.  Both of these should be wake up calls for us to rethink how we as a country respond to threats.  And that means taking hard looks at how we are institutionally structured.  Sounds boring, right?  But the downside is a whole lot worse."
2021-06-20 15:20:35,"The CDC has inadequate funding or is a politicized bureaucracy? If the latter, no amount of money will fix it. Personally, incompetence should also be a primary problem noted. Americans believe others are ""anti-science"" is at least partly due to lack of leadership of the CDC during this crisis"
2021-06-20 15:37:59,"Perhaps if they just concentrated on infectious diseases they could do a much better job. We should create a separate agency that can address other chronic illnesses, including obesity, gun violence etc."
2021-06-20 15:42:57,"Fauci said ""Don't wear a mask.""  His excuse now was that PPE was in short supply.  Then we were told that essentially any face covering was better than none.
Also, where does the CDC find the authority to prevent evictions?  Shouldn't they have focused on the evolving situation?"

2021-06-20 16:31:47,"I don't feel the CDC can be fixed because of the nature of the problem.  Imagine a navy seal academy is established in 1946, but never sees actual combat until 2020.  Having a massive bureaucracy just lie in  wait for decades and expecting it to spring in action when the time comes isn't reasonable.  Especially when decentralized groups like the ""Working Group"" showed far more effectiveness."
2021-06-20 16:33:06,"There are three internet problems in data collection that may not be obvious from the outside.  1.  A new problem requires new or enhanced data, but if new data aren't carefully defined the new data can't be used with the existing data, so there isn't a way to plug the change from the developing information.  2.  Definitions need to be superficialities enough to track the problem and general enough not to be fragmented.  Example data were one collected on organized football and unorganized football with the intent to septette say high school football head injuries from playing catch in the back yard,  but the subjective definition of ""organized"" made the difference unworkable.  Social class would be an example of a useful but difficult to define and obtain variable.  3. Then if these two problems are solved the length of the collection document becomes a problem.  

In some ways it is a good thing we want better data.  That's how we do better.  CDC and their Assoicates have difficult problems, and one is the data side.  The requirements will evolve and be solved in bites of various rises."
2021-06-20 16:33:15,"For anyone interested in deeper information about the CDC's failures, or looking simply for action-packed tales of Covid's largely-unfettered rampage here, I'd recommend two new books by expert journalist-authors. From Michael Lewis, ""The Premonition"" and by Lawrence Wright, ""The Plague Year"".

Together, brick-by-brick, they take apart the CDC's failed response and how heroic local and private experts took over. Addressing a personal peeve: They prove why the news media must stop automatically labeling the center, the the world's ""premier public-health agency"". Even the best newspapers, and even through the pandemic, routinely describe the agency as the world leader in combatting infectious diseases. Sometimes, yes, though mostly in the past. But too often, especially now, it's simply untrue.
 
Why isn't the CDC director shielded from political whims like the director of the FBI? The leader of federal law enforcement is appointed for a single 10-year term, approved by the Senate, but then stands largely apart from the president and politicians, to be removed only for cause. Of course it's not foolproof -- e.g. James Comey's firing  -- but it's a far sight better and the position far more indepedent, than now.

Remember one brief Trump appointee as CDC director? She was discovered trading in food and drug stocks, including tobacco.

Unlike this writer, I don't think today's CDC merits sweeping, enforceable authority over local public health officers."
2021-06-20 16:37:49,"This is the real key as to why the CDC did not function properly: ""And during the Trump administration, agency leaders stood by while politicians and political appointees repeatedly undermined the agency’s staff.""
The CDC really needs insulation from the politicians in DC. The fact that up until Trump and the current crop of Republicans it worked fine, should give everyone the one clue they need to see why there was a bit of a meltdown over covid."

Can the CDC be fixed?   Can  Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs be fixed?

Of course they can all be fixed.   Biden's team is at work repairing the Executive Branch services at all levels, right now.  But the destruction Trump's incompetents did will take years to repair.  If we can assure two or three consecutive Democratic presidencies now occur, our government ""... of the People, by the People and for the People ..."" will be back in pristine order."

2021-06-20 16:45:33,"Recently trained physicians and PHD epidemiologists at the CDC know their fields and have mastered state of the art technologies and methods.

Hollowing out the agencies, including the CDC, might make for applause lines at CPAC and at the political convention of one of the two major parties — but poisoning those agencies from within simply calls to mind Walt Kelly’s wise observation in “Pogo” two generations ago: “We have met the enemy and he is us.”"
2021-06-20 16:31:48,"Although this welter of information is highly informative, the real reason America failed in its  response to the pandemic -- and has the death percentage rate to prove it -- is because we lacked the national will to implement a unified response.  

As the article  itself notes, “This is not a public-health problem, or even a medical one . . . [but] an issue of organizational capacity.”  

So we need to look at how America became a ""Can't Do"" nation.

Solving the ventilation problem in schools wasn't all that difficult. 
*  Open Front Doors
* Put 4 giant fans in a push air into school. 
*  Open hallway doors, open windows (make windows holes in walls)
* turn on fans.

Instant ventilation.

The reason this wasn't done is because America lacks national will.  It's an ""everybody for themself"" society, grab what you can.  So, chaos."

2021-06-20 16:51:14,"Please remember that public health is both a federal and a state responsibility. The states have starved their public health departments for decades and today they have become too dependent on federal funding from CDC. The Congress has likewise starved the CDC and put restrictions on how the money can be spent. There is clearly a need for the states to live up to their responsibility and fund their public health departments to do their job. Biden has given CDC funding but Congress needs to up its annual CDC allocation to ensure the agency does fall back. CDC made a lot of errors some of their own making, some related to an outdated public health system and infrastructure, some forced upon them by a politicizing central administration, and some by the states and competing institutions wanting to do their own thing. CDC will need to do some soul searching to clean up their own part of this mess. Replace the leaders' who sold their integrity to the Trump administration and the leaders who cannot move beyond 'business as usual' with younger, innovative out-of-the-box thinking next generation of leaders who do what needs to be done and seek public and political approval while they are doing it."
2021-06-20 16:56:01,"Defense And Education. Defense and Education is what any government must do or die. 
The CDC is as important a component of our Defense Department as any of the other Uniformed Defense Services. Among the uniformed Defense Services they have each their own Medical Services, Doctors, Navy Corpsmen and Medics. 
There is a resistance to the recognition of permanent war. When it comes to diseases permanent war against debilitating disease is just the way it is. 
The CDC requires the same treatment by Congress as do any of the other of the Uniformed Defense Forces. If we want to we can name a new institution as the Disease Defense Force."
2021-06-20 17:03:28,"The CDC needs to be freed from political control. There should not be political appointees in charge of any of our critical medical or scientific organizations.  A peer chosen and reviewed small list of qualified leaders could be presented to the President to choose from. No President has the background to make truly wise and informed decisions on these matters, they are not experts in those fields."
2021-06-20 17:08:35,"I’ve seen many complaints here about early non-masking directives from the CDC. Frankly, it was clear to me (and presumably many others) from the outset that masks would be vital to controlling this disease. But I also realized that masks were in short supply, and that riots might ensue if the CDC were to recommend them early on.  So I stayed home a lot.

Even now, it’s hard for me to second-guess that early CDC guidance."
2021-06-20 17:12:40,"The Department of Defense had and supposedly spent 714 BILLION DOLLARS in 2020.   Let's get real people there's no telling where the money all went, although the GOA does what it can to parse out some of the billions that are horrendously dubious in nature.     We're a year and a half into the first pandemic in a hundred years.  The Delta variant his past approaching almost every state in this country, It's morphed into a much more severe strain, and we're all sitting here reading this extremely frustrating article on the CDC?    Time to take as many billions from the department of defense budget as needed and EMPOWER the CDC, the NIH, and all other health-related government agencies.  The military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about is suffocating our government and therefore we citizens.  I don't want to pay for that anymore, I want billions going into making this country healthier and happier, as opposed to spending billions ruining other countries and taking their natural resources.   God help us all if the variance spins out of control, or even stronger ones emerge in the next few months before school starts."
2021-06-20 17:15:13,"Can the CDC be fixed? Probably not. Nor can the WHO or the FDA.

The problem is that lawmakers establish bureaucracies to do a task, but eventually they become jobs- and pensions-generating apparatuses that make work for themselves of little use to society, always calling for more ""resources"" to do the needless work.

By then, the lawmakers have forgotten about overseeing them. When a crisis emerges, their deficiencies become apparent, sometimes at the cost of many lives.

One probably could eliminate half of the jobs in the federal government, along with the agencies that fill them, and no one would ever notice the difference. The difficulty for lawmakers and the public, though, is figuring out which half are useless."
2021-06-20 17:17:17,"a very thorough and interesting piece. I would have chosen a slightly different title for it since the premise seemed rather controversial. the politicization of the CDC is probably the biggest problem that organization faced. while Congress should control their budget and direct what type of r&d spending is made. they need to keep the United States prepared for the next pandemic. I found it amazing that the previous administration was simply able to throw out the pandemic playbook and put a spin on a virus that cost us $500,000 lives!"
2021-06-20 16:47:55,"The description here of the CDC sounds like a description of our government and of our society.  According to many people the police are a mess, congress is a mess, the Supreme Court is a mess, the environment is a mess, Amazon.com is a mess, religion is a mess, etc. etc.

Maybe the CDC is doing about the best it can given the fact that our country is a mess.   It can't be any better organized and goal-oriented when the country itself is disorganized and different groups have very different goals."
2021-06-20 16:50:07,"The CDC has been chronically underfunded. That being said the main criticism levelled against the CDC appears to be that it did not move faster to reopen schools and drop masking and social distancing guidelines. This to put it crudely, smells. There is ample evidence that schools are major vectors of transmission, despite politically driven assertions to the contrary. Comparing schools to hospitals defies even common sense."
2021-06-20 17:01:02,"As an immune compromised person, I agree with all the comments that the CDC mask mandates were unhelpful at best and potentially deadly because they refused to recognize the virus was airborne despite all the evidence from super spreader events.  But here is the thing.  How could you write this article about the CDC without highlighting its biggest blunder during Covid?  The pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was not only unnecessary but did more to stoke vaccine hesitancy than any tweet from Trump or Ron DeSantis.  How on earth could the supposed best and brightest working team under Tom Shimbakuru make such poor recommendations to APIC and against the recommendation cations of the FDA and HHS.  As the person from the Maine CDC said at the committee hearing - by pausing and not making a decision, the CDC and APIC effectively made a decision that resulted in all unvaccinated persons think there was something wrong with all vaccines and we are still living with the consequences today (it’s the reason why we won’t get to President Biden’s goal of 70 percent by 4 July).  It’s a scandal and shame on the CDC and it’s advisory committee.  In my view, they should both be disbanded for incompetence and replaced with new blood."
2021-06-20 17:03:25,"COVID-19 has shown that a federal-state hybrid governmental system cannot be successful given the challenges of today.  The underlying problem with the CDC - and in dealing with so many critical issues facing the US - is that 50+ separate governments will never be able to mount a unified response to anything, let alone a deadly pandemic virus.  State and local political considerations will interfere with efficient and logical responses to challenges that arise.  Something as simple as a nationwide mask mandate - which should have been declared as soon as SARS CoV-2 was found to be transmissible through the air (droplets/aerosols) - could not be enforced due to the federal system.  As a result, we saw wildly different approaches to safety in the states and territories.  Science wasn't followed and reason gave way to political posturing and tribal anger fomentation.
We need to establish some national rules about health emergencies and give the central government more power to enact safeguards and mandate control measures.  If we do not, we will cycle through one public health disaster after another, a nation of Sisyphuses endlessly trying to reach the summit of relief, only to have to retrace our steps over and again.  We cannot tolerate futility as the basis for our national public health policy."
2021-06-20 17:15:34,"The GOP has evolved into a fact-denying organism and they've learned that the best way to do that is to prevent the facts from being collected, whether in labs or by satellites."
2021-06-20 17:27:55,"Two very important things left out of this essay:

The CDC bungled development of COVID-19 tests badly.  The first tests it developed were useless due to contamination caused by CDC employees not following rules.  Meanwhile it didn't allow use of working tests developed by other countries.

The CDC is a victim of regulatory capture.  There is a revolving door between high level people at the CDC and at the pharmaceutical companies who's products it approves or disapproves.  The CDC also makes quite a bit of money from vaccine patents."
2021-06-20 17:35:03,"If the CDC had strongly supported the universal wearing of N95 masks and the measures necessary to make them available early in 2020, the worst of the covid crisis would have been avoided.  I have no medical training, but do have a Ph.D. in engineering and extensive  experience in failure analysis and failure avoidance.  The necessary steps were obvious to me at the time.
The CDC has demonstrated negative value in this crisis with its misleading and often completely incorrect advice from the beginning."
2021-06-20 17:36:11,Brilliantly written. Clearly our entire public health system exists in separate silos all controlled by political keys. Thomas Friedan’s suggestion of embedding CDC scientists in states is such a thoughtful step towards the future. I had no idea that the CDC was so backward in its technology. Real shame that public health is being underfunded by the federal government. Perhaps if Trump had not been so useless the true bumbling of the CDC might never have been exposed. Sure hope the brilliant scientists at the CDC form a cooperative similar to the collaborative at Harvard so they can give consolidated advice to the head of CDC. She sure seems to speak before mulling information that comes her way. Surely there can be a way forward to connected state public health with the CDC in a more efficient way. Perhaps it’s time to get someone from outside the agency to organize the system as one body with many arms. Hopefully it will be  a bipartisan appointment.
2021-06-20 18:00:24,"As I mull and read more comments, I think of the military. It’s funded by congress and has a civilian Defense Secretary.  The CDC should have two parallel missions supported by the right funding, culture and leadership. One is medical science the other is war, the battle to contain and destroy viruses and other threats. It should be run by a civilian leader, not another CDC scientist, who can transcend both politics and scientific rigidity. For one, while frustrated with Fauci, my expectations of him were as a medical/immunology expert. I expect him to be inflexible and data driven. But someone with authority, not the president, should be able to sit in the room with the scientists and raise the challenging questions and weigh diverse risks.  

The mentality of “even if it saves one life” would have us stop living in its tracks, which Covid policy generally did."
2021-06-20 17:24:34,"Perhaps we need a new Surgeon General Terry who was an avid smoker until he studied it and found out the damage it causes. 

He got on CBS News in the 1960s and told the people smoking was bad. 

If there was a Surgeon General now who could speak to the American people and say something like “we are not an isolated country anymore, the diseases that effect other countries effect us as well and it is still rampant in India, South America and more. We are in Covid-19 for the long haul - wear a mask.”  Things might change."
2021-06-20 17:32:18,Where are the whistleblowers?
2021-06-20 17:35:57,"I’d remind that these problems are pretty much exactly what you got with NHS in England and the IRS here: a couple decades of budget cuts, endless right-wing politicizations, and then you turn around and start yelling about how it din’t work right.

See also infrastructure and public schools."
2021-06-20 17:36:23,"To ""fix"" governments you have to win elections.  You won't win elections by pandering to small segments of society and hectoring the rest, or, for that matter lying about problems."
2021-06-20 17:30:08,The CDC is broken because of its four years subject to trump and science-denying republicans. It was/has been chronically under-funded and was politicized.
2021-06-20 17:43:45,"Yup.
But in all fairness, the WHO blew it also, and has the same problem that the CDC has.  It is beholden for money to those governments who can ignore its recommendations.  
The miscues early on in the science assuming the virus spread by droplets rather than by aerosol had chilling effects on mortality and delayed useful mitigation strategies. 
The Trump administration, adding insult in injury, politicized the agency for its own goals and Trump openly flaunted mask wearing and promoted indoor political rallies which likely resulted in super-spreader events.  Even in the end, he wanted credit for “Operation Warp Speed” but received his vaccine in secret.  
Pandora’s box will open again.  Unless the WHO, and its member nations including the USA get its act together, the next time might even be worse."
2021-06-20 17:34:23,CDC has lost credibility with me but if they rebuild and follow the science they may gain it back.
2021-06-20 18:12:27,"The CDC is built on the idea that the goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality from disease and they make recommendation and rules from that perspective.  From that perspective they made rules and recommendations for school reopening.  While the author and others may be all knowing all of the time, it's ridiculous to argue that putting the kids closer together doesn't increase morbidity and mortality in the community to some extent at least and how much is a judgement call that had, and still has, to be made without very good scientific evidence (though the evidence improves all the time of course).  

It boils down to the author and many others seeing the death of old people as much less of a problem, or maybe no problem, than the deaths of young or middle aged people and thus see the CDC's rules as overly restrictive because they traditionally haven't made the distinction that older people's lives are worth less.  The CDC is conservative and slow to accept data that challenge their accepted ideas but this is practically universal among institutions and even individuals.  I think the criticisms are overblown, but I do think if you want a better functioning institution then it should be moved out of Atlanta because you're never going to get the best and brightest to move there."
2021-06-20 18:12:36,"In plain terms, this article is largely Monday-Morning-Quarterbacking. Everyone now has a clearer picture of what happened and what might have been ideal behavior. The bitterness flowing through these paragraphs is not helpful.

Unlike other countries that had dealt with significant viral outbreaks in recent years and had re-shaped their public health systems to accommodate that reality, the U.S. was spared the outbreaks, but was left in a state of theoretical preparedness. So now we know.

Let us hope that we all learn from the mistakes that were made–and there were many–at all levels of government and common citizenry. One thing we can do right now is to kill the pandemic. Continue to be cautious in our behavior, monitor our health carefully, get tested when in doubt, and GET VACCINATED. 

We could have knocked off this pandemic at this time last year, but poor attitudes and ignorance kept it going. Let us please end it now. The solution to this is not with the government, it is in the hands of the public."
2021-06-20 18:39:48,"As a former CDC leader, I am relieved to see such excellent reporting by the Times on such important issues.  Just a few of other points to emphasize, hoping that national discussion continues.

1). The US suffers from a lack of a national health system - a system in which healthcare and public health are coordinated at a national level with common health outcome measures.  What keeps us from correcting this obvious problem?  Ideology.

2).  In the absence of science- and health outcomes-driven funding objectives, the funding of CDC has devolved into a political system of multiple, uncoordinated well-positioned advocacy groups hiring lobbyists to get CDC funding line items that become CDC's budget.  A serious public health problem without an effective advocacy group and lobbyist does not get funding.  A small number of large funding lines, combined with more authority for CDC, and linked to national health outcomes would really help. Get the lobbyists out of public health.

3).   Lack of CDC authority and ""States Rights"".  Tom Frieden's suggestion of integrating States and  CDC staff  could help, but to effectively mount appropriate rapid public health responses across states lines, the CDC must have ultimate authority.  The barrier to this fix?  Ideology.

4).  Get the politicians off the stage when it comes to public health.  Voters, tell them to shut up.

5).  Re-establish the CDC presence/office in China, previously cut by the Trump administration."
2021-06-20 17:52:35,"The key here is leadership. The head honcho (Trump) wasn't on board (""it will go away""). Good management can make even a mediocre product sell; poor management--and I've seen this many times--can mess up a great product."
2021-06-20 18:29:45,Everything Trump touched broke.  You want to fix things?  Persuade the Supreme Court that there are things the President can't do to the agencies. No firing without cause or stifling information.
2021-06-20 18:35:38,"The risk of catching COVID outdoors is nearly zero. Yet  CDC guidelines basically eliminated all outdoor social activities for over a year. Likewise, catching the bug from a toilet seat or any other surface  is equally slim, yet a large army of workers wasted millions of man hours sanitizing them.  The agency spent billions studying how viruses mutate and conducts controversial experiments “helping” viruses mutate.  But when this virus, possibly created in a Chinese lab, or possibly a natural mutation, was declared a pandemic,the CDC was as much in the dark as how not to contract it as the rest of us. I find that appalling. 

The consensus is that the another pandemic is a given.  Hopefully, before that happens the CDC will know a lot more about human to human transmission and provide the public with better tools to avoid getting sick. Losing a year or more waiting for a vaccine is not going to work."
2021-06-20 18:14:21,"Under Trump and Pence, the CDC was staffed by ardent pro-lifers--Redfield, Kaldlec, Giroire, etc. Their main goal was to obstruct access to abortion, birth control, and healthcare for LGBTQ and make Trump ""the most pro-life president in history.""  When Covid hit, they had not a clue about what to do about it and prevented long-time CDC scientists from speaking out. It seems odd to pick on CDC efforts (now under Biden) to correct the outrageous failings of the Trump years without mentioning this part of this tragic history."
2021-06-20 18:46:09,"My state has a 73% vaccination level to date, and a testing positivity rate of well under 1%. To this day, I see people wearing masks while alone in a car, while outside jogging alone, and servers at restaurants are wearing masks in full capacity restaurants where no one else is.  These behaviors represent paranoia derived from misinformation and a lack of clarity about what preventative actions make sense. On Friday I will fly to Los Angeles on an airplane where COVID transmission is no longer a risk, and yet I will be forced to follow another unnecessary, onerous masking rule. Vaccinated persons do not need masks. Period. This simple statement would be an excellent starting point for CDC to recover their image."
2021-06-20 18:48:15,"It seems to me that the lack of shared timely data greatly encourages political manipulation at all levels of government.

Since the lack of shared timely data is helped by outdated computers and qualified staff, the rebuilding of the CDC should start here. So maybe, instead of evermore “private” clouds and proprietary smart devices and computerized entertainment, the broad tech community could unite in an effort to provide the public health infrastructure of one set of computers and software
(Have a competition to name it) that could be used nationally.

It might be politically difficult to “opt-out” of such a system."
2021-06-20 18:49:35,"A very few of us in Florida knew the previous Governor Rick Scott now Rick WINNER Scott took an axe to the State Dept. of Health among other agencies and hundreds of research jobs were cut. During the Pandemic year,inaccurate and sometimes incorrect information was peddled by the Governor's Office-DeSantis and given to the County Depts. of Health for Public Information Officers to distribute on social media platforms,etc. The CDC became a political pawn and needs some Congressional advocates in this Biden term or terms to restore full funding. Don't count on Florida ever restoring the lost jobs. We love our low taxes which is why some of you in the Midwest and Northeast keep coming on down,every week."
2021-06-20 11:09:12,"Reality Check CDC  can kick can down road an try to make covid work but untill we fix what enables covid 19 its futile.

2021-06-20 18:43:55,"Anyone could see that the CDC didn't even use common sense, let alone science. It's no surprise to me the U.S. handled this pandemic like a 3rd world corrupt and inept country. And it's not like we don't have any examples of nations that DID handle it so much better!"
2021-06-20 18:54:42,"“But the result is something with no rational plan behind it.” That is not true. There is a rational plan. The plan is no centralized coordination, no common standard of collecting, archiving, and sharing information, different agencies competing with each other over resources, and no federal control over state and local actions and responses. This policy is driven by state independence from the federal government, which is what the states want. Is it the best, most efficient policy? Of course not. But it’s the policy we clearly have asked for."

The CDC also seemed to couch their guidance based on assumptions regarding our collective response; which was in fact, not very collective, and in some instances, not much of a response. The problem is that once you start massaging the message, you can't go back to the beginning and start over with a clean slate. So, in the future, I would recommend not trying to figure out how the public will react to a fact or other type of important beforehand and then formulating the message to fit the ""outcome"", but to just focus on the accuracy information and let the chips fall were they may."

There was a plan that could've been used; they chose not to follow it.  Trump undercut our science agencies prior to the virus to save money.  Now there are things a lot worse out there than Covid-19 and that's why you have a fully funded ready to go CDC.

It wands to study and direct, without knowing much about getting things done.   It has lost a lot its respect by state and local health agencies, which themselves are weak, poorly funded and led.   The CDC should be reconstitutede as an operating agency.   Its R&D and policy formulation duties should be farmed out to nonprofits, universities, or govt agencies who do that kind of thing.   Last and probably least, incompetent workers and managers and CDC who did not do their jobs adequately in the pandemic should be retrained or penalized or fired."

However. 

Within three months, they were telling everybody what this was, what was known and what wasn’t, and what the next moves needed to be. And they did this against a backdrop of a “president,” and a political party, that was attacking them and spreading flat-out lies fifty times a day. Against a backdrop of an insane right-wing news apparatus. 

And against a whole passel of Amurricans who announced that they done knowed better than no pencil-neck commies, and I’m doin’ what I want, when I want, and if some pointy-head health officer tells me no, I am showin’ up with a gun at their house. You really think that if they’d got the testing right immediately and issued clear guidance on masking, all these yahoos would have cheerfully gone along? 

Please. 

Their problems are a mirror of ours."
2021-06-20 19:42:14,"It's about time the CDC was  put on the hot seat.  All the alphabet institutions ...CDC, NHI, WHO, UN..have been completely useless during the pandemic. I remember the big scandal when the CDC was caught not properly storing lethal samples and not even knowing where half of them were or who had them.  They have been a politicized crony employer for decades."
2021-06-20 19:27:39,Anyone who doubts that politics affected CDC guidelines should remember how condoms  for STD prevention  intermittently disappeared from the CDC website to be replaced by abstinence-- depending upon who was in the White House.
2021-06-20 19:49:39,"As a working scientist,  I find myself sympathetic to the CDC, but familiar with its muddled, conservative responses: That’s science. By nature, we test and retest existing ideas. And as Kuhn famously showed, we favor consensus. We cling to orthodoxy until it can be decisively overthrown. I will get more professional reward for elaborating what’s already known than trying to shoot it down. I will get more financial aid for mining what’s already worked for me than striking out a novel direction. 

Now consider politics: Ponderous. Always shifting budgetary priorities. Always reacting belatedly to emergencies. Always placing ideology ahead of problem solving, always stupendously inefficient in here and now tasks, like using modern computers and modern communication infrastructure to coordinate responses among its own agencies, let alone between federal, state, and local governments? 

The CDC is doomed by its core task science mating with politics - to fail. Sorry, but we need to start over."
2021-06-20 20:01:25,"I don't understand this part of the article:
> It had been clear for many months that outdoor transmission was exceedingly rare, and most experts agreed that fully vaccinated people were highly unlikely to contract the virus and even less likely to pass it on to others if they did. Why was it taking the C.D.C., the supposed leader in global public health, so long to acknowledge what everyone else could see so clearly?

The data largely showed that transmission from people without any symptoms was very common, if not the majority. That there was airborne transmission in most cases. Given that, how do you actually determine that outdoor transmission rates are low with any certainty?

Additionally given that compliance is already low, that determining who is or isn't vaccinated is too much to ask to monitor situational mask wearing compliance, and that there's much less of a down side to to wearing a mask when not needed than not wearing one when needed... advising anything other than keeping masks on in all public interactions seems poorly considered."
2021-06-20 20:04:11,"A long overdue article acknowledging what many of us trying to evolve the public health field have been hitting our heads against for years. There seems to be an omertà when it comes to recognizing where public health leadership failed. Part of the culture problem among some epidemiologists, both nationally and at the local level, is an obsessive adherence to antiquated methods - nothing can be as good as what they did as EIS officers 20 years ago - and a field dominated by white academics who don’t feel the need to explain themselves to regular people and often fail to see how their actions (or inactions) affect people. 
It’s time to redefine what public health leadership means and place more value the ability to produce operational guidance than academic publications."

2021-06-20 11:11:31,"This over a year-late article touches on a few problems with the CDC and the botched pandemic response but ignores the underlying cause.

""Julie Gerberding tried to change the agency’s funding structure so that states could have more flexibility in how they spent CDC dollars""

Actually Gerberding represents the underlying problem: Pharma capture of the regulatory agencies.  

Our Pharma Healthcare System is ranked 37th in the world, but is the most expensive and profitable.  That ranking is why our Covid deaths per million (1,854) is 3.7 times higher than the world average (497).  

Why hasn't the media held Pharma to account?  (Because 90% of the media is owned by Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street - who also own Pharma?)

The CDC is funded and staffed via the revolving door by Pharma.  Their true mission is to ensure Pharma profits.

Julie Gerberding, the former CDC Director, left to become president of Merck’s vaccine division.  She sold Merck stock options totaling $16,592,144.  At CDC, she fast-tracked Merck's Gardasil, which pushed up cervical cancer rates in the UK by 54%.

Capture is the underlying problem, but why specifically is our D/M so high?  Because Pharma-captured authorities ordered No Early Treatment for Covid.

Dr. Peter McCullough, who's published more Covid papers (40) than anyone, states 85% of Covid deaths were avoidable with Early Treatment:

Amd is the only thing of importance that ther e be open schools.  IMO the really impt. thing given the shoddy state of American education -- we don't think cursive is impt.

We  desperately need  all kinds of online classes - directed at teaching whatever unit  -- so  when the school kids attend doesn't have skilled teachers, kids can learn -- and most impt. repeat lessons they may not have understood.  World calss athletes , e.g., are constantly training the same thing.. but in education - you may only take this course once.  Why?   
I figured out that double maks prob. worked better than single, before the CDC - aka common sense.  And it certainly took a lot of time to realize soap and water worked.. and the nonsens about not reusing a mask... and the lak of instructions for making one's own.

We know we cannot trust China, so we need people on the ground.  Scientists KNEW how devastating an effect a pandemic would have world wide.  We had measures in place to prevent epidemics from becoming pandemics.  Even China knew this and that is why SARS and  a few others did not become as bad as this.

That ignorance allows politicians to interfere with agencies like the C.D.C. from providing scientifically based guidance of public policies. It’s so bad that Trump can openly ask why a virus that can be instantly destroyed by UV or bleach cannot be destroyed inside of living things using the same means. It was the question of someone with a brain disorder but nobody seriously challenged the competence of the man who thought him their party’s leader. That’s pathetic and indicative of the nature of the problem.

Our covid Deaths per Million is 1,854.  The global average is 498.  Why has no media asked, ""What are they doing that we are not doing?""  Dr. Peter McCullough, the most published MD on covid, has the answer:

<a href=""https://tinyurl.com/4a3wdxac"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/4a3wdxac</a>

Why has the media not asked that Simple Question?  The government is captured by Pharma and the media is  the propaganda arm of the government (Chomsky).  And 90% of media is owned/controlled by Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street - who also own Pharma.  We forget that income inequality necessarily implies extreme ownership and control concentration.  In 2017 80% of the income went to the global 1%.

2021-06-20 19:56:12,"This is one of the most ridiculous articles I have read. It seems to me that the CDC is run by humans, and last as I recall humans are not perfect. Furthermore, this virus has unprecedented properties. Did the CDC do and say exactly the right thing all the time, or even the large majority of the time - of course not! And this is exactly what should be expected by an agency run by humans. Rather than throwing up our arms and saying ""Can the CDC by fixed"", let's learn from our mistakes so that we make fewer mistakes next time. If we demand perfection in a human endeavor, we are doomed to failure."
2021-06-20 19:53:25,The CDC and many of the other health agencies threw their credibility out the window by cowtowing to Trump.  There are consequences for letting politics set policy rather than science.  This is a self inflicted wound.

The CDC had advisory guidelines, but schools couldn't meet them. and LO, ""The CDC seemed incapable of answering these questions."" People wanted their kids to go back to school and were outraged that a mere killing pandemic should interfere with that. And let's blame it on incompetence at the CDC.

Let's also remember that the Obama Administration had a written plan for the virtual certainty of epidemics. Trump got rid of it. So it was the CDC's fault: ""And during the Trump administration, agency [CDC] leaders stood by while politicians and political appointees repeatedly undermined the agency’s staff.""

The boss, the marmalade mountain, fired or sidelined people who disagreed with him and set policy and information from his megaphone pulpit.

In hindsight, the medical establishment made some mistakes, that easily could have been corrected IF they only had about a year to study the virus, pre-order safety equipment, and have in place protocols and medicines for dealing with very sick patients. In fact, having vaccines ready in January 2020 would have been excellent too.

While we're looking in our rear view mirrors, we're only finding now by studies of patients who have had Covid that 23% of them have, possibly permanent, organ damage. I suppose that the CDC should have known that ... how?"
2021-06-20 19:37:31,"The CDC team lacks imagination because they interact and listen to like minded Ivy educated fear based professionals.

Without these voices in the conversation, the process is flawed and narrow."

Redfield looking up at Donald Trump doing one of his unhinged speeches during his visit to the CDC on March 9, 2020. As Trump declared that America solved the COVID-19 testing problem and that everything was going ""beautiful,"" Redfield nodded his head and lacked the courage to set the record straight on a litany of lies and misleading statements that would cost the country thousands of lives. Imagine how many American lives would have been saved if Redfield stated under the national spotlight that COVID-19 is not being washed away, that CDC had sent out flawed tests and that testing was not fixed, and that the lethality of COVID-19 can't be compared to the common flu (comparison that Trump made at the CDC). 

The fact that a man of such low character could become the Director of CDC is an indictment of the entire political system. Redfield's appointment was opposed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Senator Patty Murray, but why listen to the experts when crass partisan politics reigns supreme?"
2021-06-20 20:12:31,The CDC lost my confidence over a decade ago by ignoring the Tick Borne Disease TBD epidemic and standing in the way of both prevention and treatment.

2021-06-20 20:12:10,"The CDC was behind WHO refusing to tell people that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, back in January 2020 when everyone knew.

National Nurses United and Global Nurses United wrote to both CDC and WHO in January 2020 and demanded that they both acknowledge that airborne precautions were required against this airborne virus. They refused, until recently.

They killed thousands of health care workers in the US by claiming that ""nurses wear bandanas or scarves to care for ICU COVID-19 patients"", and killed hundreds of thousands of people in the US by claiming that no one needed masks. This was all for corporate greed.

The corporations were not meeting legal requirements to have adequate PPE for a pandemic, and they didn't *want* to spent money: CEOs and other execs of hospital systems get millions in bonuses each for cost cutting, and they got those  bonuses in 2020 on the backs of nurses.

CDC couldn't say the public had to wear masks while nurses were being told to wear scarves or bandanas or if lucky told to re-use non-reusable N95s for a month, or wear procedure masks that filter just 35%.  

The CDC was complicit. Remember: the CDC Foundation, funded by Gates and Bezos and Waltons and the Pharmas and AHA, defines CDC priorities and policies, for corporate benefit. THIS is the main problem, not funding or organization."

2021-06-20 20:29:44,"I would like to share my own frustration with what has unfolded. It is not related to the political interference but to an inadequate medical response. 

I am a board certified physician with an interest in infectious diseases for 40 years. When the pandemic was first breaking in Feb of 2020, there was some very uninformed actions such as washing down streets. The initial reports of disease from nursing homes, cruise ships epidemics in which the passengers were confined to their rooms and convention centers were all strong indicators that we were dealing with an aerosol spread through ventilation systems. It was at least 6 months before that gained traction.

I tried to contact the CDC, the WHO, my local hospital infectious disease expert, county and state boards of health  as well as broadcast media infectious disease experts. The only answer I ever received was a ""we will pass it along"" from the CDC. 

Today, aerosol is accepted as a main route of spread. However, information beyond that basic concept is hard to come by. I understand that improved filters have been installed in some places but I have not heard it announced that it is essential to do so. 

Personally, I believe that no business should be allowed to fully reopen unless their ventilation systems have been upgraded, filters installed and the systems inspected and results posted. If contamination of such systems is possible and happened in the past, it may be entirely possible to happen again."
2021-06-20 20:35:41,"To pretend that CDC’s ineptness and “extreme politicization” began during the Trump Administration would be precious if it weren’t so dangerous. Must I really remind that the CDC was complicit in the sickeningly unethical Tuskegee Airmen Experiments that lasted for decades, until a whistleblower ended them? Or its wildly ridiculous response to a “swine flu epidemic” that never materialized, and the rushed vaccinations upon which it insisted caused more harm than good? The New York Times itself deemed the swine flu situation a “fiasco,” and blasted the White House and Congress for lacking “sufficient sophistication in medical problems to be able to put biological reality before political expediency.” Today it is what it is. The wise course is to view anything emanating from the CDC with the proverbial grain of salt."

At both agencies friends of mine with PhDs and decades of expertise left during the Trump administration. They were pushed out by the political leaders at the top and the know-nothing politicians placed at every level of these agencies. Friends described new job positions being generated and then filled with people who had NO scientific knowledge or management experience. But they were rapid Trumpers. They pushed out the career scientists using a variety of mechanisms.  My friends have served decades and never experienced this type of political impact on the science. Some even worked under Reagan and the Bushes. They said what Trump did was like nothing they had ever experienced.

Our scientific agencies are just shells of what they once were. The problems did not start with Trump, but he accelerated it and brought them to new terrifying levels. Obama did little to help science during his 8 years in office. That was more neglect or dereliction of duty. Under Trump Scientific agencies, Scientists, and Science itself was attacked on a daily basis.

2021-06-20 21:01:55,"the CDC is not particularly broken. This article actually shows it. Moreover, by what it says but also by its mere existence as an attempt to find and place partial blames for the ravages of the pandemic, it also points to an institution that is instead broken: media.

The very best in the business of seeking and telling truth to the public are still refraining stolidly from asking for the most reasonable and quite modest redress of the ills of the past months, and necessary part of the remedy to the potential repetition of said ills: a swift and just sentence for Donald J. Trump and his enabler Mitch McConnell. For such a sentence, even only the attempted, and unfortunately partially successful corruption of the CDC should suffice.

Indeed, it makes no logical sense to call murderer a Mafia boss who suggests that he'd like a rival to take a long vacation, and not somebody who abuses great power by willingly omitting to act to protect people and actively attempting to stop others from carrying out their duty to save. What happened with Covid in the USA is equivalent to stopping ambulances from reaching a disaster zone, and the media must not distract attention from this by telling us that the ambulances had worn tires before already."

2021-06-20 21:59:11,"The CDC has little regulatory authority. That's by design. Rather than regulate, the CDC gathers information and advises. Rather than issue regulations, the CDC issues guidelines. The CDC does the thinking. Other agencies (mostly at the state level) do the work, and have the power. 

Given that, I don't think the CDC showed glaring weaknesses. On the contrary, I think it did its job well. Not that that mattered much. The CDC had no real power to affect the course of the pandemic whether it did its job poorly or well. 

The same is true of Donald Trump. People blame him for deaths, but how is he responsible? What power did he not exercise that would have resulted in fewer lives lost? What knowledge did not apply? 

The president has little to do with public health. Governors have that power, although they too in the face of an uncertain future could only react to the pandemic. They could do little to stop it."

The Trump administration and the GOP politicized the whole thing, and the CDC certainly proved not immune.  And this article, with all it's political analysis and emphasis, doesn't even catch one of the key issues, the CDC emphasis on hand washing and sanitizer and deemphasis on masks at the beginning of the pandemic.

The article is packed with half-truths and untruths. Of course, there was a pandemic response plan and a full-time staff to update it. Trump abolished it. Universities did not take over data analysis. The information CDC collects from state and local health departments is public and anyone can analyze it. Johns Hopkins did a splendid job. It did not sideline CDC, it complimented CDC.

Private sector groups that take it upon themselves to make independent recommendations leave the public confused and annoyed.

Ms. Interlandi is wrong to say that CDC can't do surveillance on the results of vaccination. It does so for all the vaccines available in the US—using at least four systems.

CDC is not a bloated and lethargic bureaucracy. It responds rapidly to outbreaks globally and with good results.

God knows CDC can be streamlined and improved and Rochelle Walensky is off to a fine start. 

Jeneen Interlnadi does the nation a disservice by exaggerating the weaknesses of the agency, rather than framing the discussion as ""how we can continue to improve CDC,"" rather than feeding the suspicions and delusions of anti-science politicians and their followers. 

And the cartoons are wildly unfair and insulting. Insult atop injury."

The article settles for ain't-it-awful reviews of mistakes and confusion and cross-purposes.  It waggles a circling finger eager to point blame - landing nowhere and everywhere.  Equally distressing are reader comments going along with this.  We all need to take a step back.  Let's appreciate the CDC as an amazingly powerful resource that requires an incredibly capable polity to make proper use of it.  Under horrible circumstances, CDC, NIH, FDA, USPHS, and state/local public health departments have helped us weather the pandemic.  Our damage would have been at least an order of magnitude worse had it run a natural course as Trump decided to last August (with Dr. Atlas, contradicting the CDC) .  Other countries that faithfully followed CDC's playbook successfully managed the pandemic (New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore). The US wrote the book but we are so diverse, so decentralized, so conflicted, and (especially under duress from Trump) too poorly led to function properly.  CDC performance is a symptom of our ailing popular democracy.  Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work on healing ourselves, including finger-pointers and CDC-haters."

2021-06-20 23:12:46,"The CDC has always been a public asset.  

But not under Trump.    

What we see here is pro Trump mainstream media bias using the corruption of the Trump years as an all encompassing halo around the agency's past."
2021-06-20 23:26:22,"Is it not a basic contradiction that this organization can be claimed to be “the “world’s premier public health agency” and at the same time demonstrate how it failed so badly dealing with a real-life world pandemic? Many, many people have died. Perhaps a reason for this failure is a bogus assumption that because it is in the US that it must be the best. The world had a great demonstration that the US is not what it claims to be with Donald, the FAA, and the CDC, one after another. You all need to step back."
2021-06-20 23:26:45,"I’m in the middle of reading The Premonition by Michael Lewis. I’ve also been waiting for an article like this to address how the CDC pandemic response came to be so bad. As long as this article is, it seems to lack any real detail or specifics. As another commenter mentioned, how can you write this article with not a single mention of Redfield. There is just room many instances of “many people argue …” and “… others disagree.” When a long form article like this is written I believe it is the obligation of the writer to tell us what they conclude. They have spent months wrapped up in the issue and they have certainly made judgements about where the bulk of the truth lies. Withholding or masking that judgement just makes the article bland and unsatisfying.

And come on, let’s be honest about which states cooperate with the CDC and which do not. The authors know this. Why don’t they address it? I’m sure there are exceptions but I’ll bet anything that republican states are the most difficult and the democratic states are the ones cooperating. The vaccination data shows this pattern VERY clearly. My state of AZ is still R dominated even though we voted narrowly for Biden and now have 2 D senators. But our vaccination rate is terrible. The bottom 10 states in vaccination are dominated by republican states and the top 10 is dominated by Democratic ones."
2021-06-20 23:45:19,"The CDC is not nimble enough.  This has been their problem from the beginning of the pandemic.  Here are the latest examples:

Epidemiologists were sounding the alarm on the delta variant in early April.  However, the CDC waited until May 4th to impose a travel ban.  Allowing hundredths or possibly thousands of introductions increase the probability that some of them will go to seed big outbreaks.

Public Health England declared delta a variant of concern on May 7th, WHO declared it one on May 11th, and US CDC waited until June 15th to declare it one.

CDC encourage people to take the J&J vaccine in Feb/March. 
Folks who took  the one jab do not know how well protected they are against the delta variant.  Why?  All the studies regarding vaccines resistance are coming from Europe.  

Where is the CDC?  why haven't they provided any recommendations to those who took the J&J?"
2021-06-20 23:57:30,"I might have more confidence in CDC Director Walensky if she didn't don thousands of dollars worth of jewelry every time she steps in front of the camera. 

Her Van Cleef collection is impressive. $10K on the earrings, another $8-10K on the pendant necklace. Mix and match with the usual suspects, chunky diamond collars, beefy gold collars or fat diamond solitares, and it suggests a vanity at play that is at odds with the gravitas and serious nature of her position. 

But...
when she trotted out the $50,000 full diamond Van Cleef collar necklace in 18K white gold, I had wonder what is going on in her head? 

And no, none of these pieces appeared at a black-tie White House event. Just everyday press and professional presentations. 

I want to have confidence in Walensky's leadership, but it's undermined when it appears the good doctor sees the prosaic and serious job of doing the peoples public health work as an opportunity to trot out her pricey jewelry collection. Clearly she spends a lot of money on jewelry and thinks about opportunities to wear it.

Do I want a CDC director's mind on this kind of frivolous stuff? No. Such behavior says something highly salient about where a person's head is at and reflects an aspect of shallowness, insecurity and vanity that always shows itself in other aspects of personal and professional capacity in negative ways. 

Much prefer VP Harris' practical elegant-enough pearls to Walensky's weird over-the-top over-dressed choices."
2021-06-21 00:07:14,"I can't make any sense of this article. Finding relevant differences between hospitals and face-to-face schooling does not require magic to explain why hospitals can function in a global pandemic and face-to-face schooling can't. 
How about ... hospital staff are trained adult professionals. School children are not. On the whole hospitals and their staff can be relied upon to wear and manage PPE as required. They have long experience with it. Schools and their children do not and cannot. 
How about THIS. The Delta variant that is replacing the ancestral covid strain across the world has a high infection rate in children."
2021-06-21 00:14:28,"The U.S. political system is quite decentralized to state and local levels — much more so than countries in Europe and Asia. This makes us worse at preparing for, and responding to, broad threats that span state and local boundaries. Our failure to prevent the 9-11 terrorist attack, and to prevent more COVID deaths, are examples. There are some exceptions to this, such as military threats, but such threats have been exaggerated ever since WWII.


On the other hand, we have many more resources than these other countries, and in rare cases when we’re able to focus them on a single goal, such as producing a vaccine quickly, winning WWII, or getting to the moon, we can do better. If only this happened more often!"

2021-06-21 00:25:28,"The CDC needs to be protected by a legislative mandate that prevents political meddling by ignorant fools in the White House or elsewhere.

2021-06-20 20:51:37,"Excellent article. But I disagree with its conclusions. 

What government agency doesn't think it needs more money and more power to do its job? Especially at the federal level in an area where the states have primary responsibility. 

The Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Education are similar in that regard. They will bloat as big as you will let them. 

This pandemic has taught us some lessons, but different people are taking different lessons from it. To me, the lesson is that things work best with distributed control, rather than centralized. With an agile response, rather than a prepared one. 

Take vaccinations. Joe Biden took office and announced that the federal government would lead the vaccination effort. That was a waste. A few federal centers were set up here and there. They were unneeded (providing less than 1% of doses) and soon closed down. 

This pandemic hit the US hard. But no one really knows why. The CDC made some mistakes. People always do. But we muddled through it. The vaccines have been amazing. But a lot of that was luck."
2021-06-21 00:47:42,"CDC had decades of experience in responding to epidemics. I read there were 11 templates, each one updated using experience from the latest epidemic.

So why aren't they available for public review?

A more fundamental issue is the role of the FDA in developing or adapting vaccines. That has been a mystery.

Even worse is a new President who appears to want to base his re-election on ending the COVAR-19 epidemic and is deliberately ignoring the effort of his predecessor."
2021-06-21 01:00:06,"When the C.D.C. Director weakened masking mandates while knowing the lower than desired vaccination rates, the lack of vaccines available for children under 12, and the threat of the Delta variant, I just sadly thought ""They, the Trump followers and the likes of them, have won."""
2021-06-21 01:06:58,"The number and quality of comments here insisting that a new president or CDC director with four months in office are the cause of CDC disfunctionality is utterly absurd. Just ignore the dumpster fire of the Trump ""presidency,"" right?

If these commenters really are Americans, then we know how Donald Trump got elected: an epidemic of sheer stupidity."
2021-06-21 01:10:52,"As Michael Lewis makes clear in his book, “The Premonition,” the CDC has become so politicized and bloated as to become not just ineffective, but inhibitory in the sphere of public health.  It is competent in producing studies ‘after the fact.’ However, when it comes to providing guidance and advice, it’s strategy is to deflect, delay, and duck.  At the very least, the Center needs to be renamed.  Perhaps a better acronym would be the CDR – Center for Disease Reporting. It’s a complete misnomer to include the word “Control” in describing the Center."
2021-06-21 01:24:01,"The article would be more helpful if it was better informed. CDC has been operating under rules that enable recommendations but do not allow CDC to tell states what to do for decades. It isn't suddenly a problem. If CDC were to be a regulatory agency, it would create any number of new problems, and under the current rules, CDC retains many ways of forcing states' hands.

The informants here are an odd bunch. For example, Bill Darrow has had little if anything to do with CDC for many years. 

Like other articles, there is no critical assessment of Walensky's appropriateness for the job. She is not a public health person---she's never run a health department and to the limited extent she did clinical work at Harvard, it was treating people for infectious diseases--public health is a much more than that. her research was computational modeling, not clinical trials or descriptive clinical research. She was one of a number of people whose work on the cost-effectiveness of HIV testing led to opt-out testing policies which put a small dent in new HIV cases but have failed to enable us to test our way out of the epidemic, in part, because populations at risk often aren't participating in the health care system (many of them because they are otherwise healthy) and so they are not reached by testing.  I've met her and seen her present--she's a pleasant person and a competent researcher in an area that routinely fails to predict well, but totally out of her depth running CDC."
2021-06-21 02:12:49,"Lifting outdoor masking makes sense. The problem is the variants, even if vaccinated people will not be infected. Lifting the mask mandates for indoor settings such as stores, etc., without a verification mechanism, will enable unvaccinated people to congregate and spread the virus, which, in turn will mutate into new variants that may eventually evade the vaccine. It's evolution. The variants mutate so they can survive, hence, they are getting more contagious and less vulnerable to the vaccine. This was a dumb idea, and frankly, surprising. It seems to be based on politics rather than science. Quite disappointing."

2021-06-21 02:24:29,"I preferred when the CDC gave guidance based on science, rather than endless conjecture based on the whims of its poorly paid government “scientists.”

No, it doesn’t. The way this works is a little like poker: you want a seat at the table, you have to ante up. And in this case, the table stakes start with basic scientific literacy. 

You can’t put that up, fine. But in this venue, there is no reasonable expectation that I have to do more than point, dissect, and burst out laughing."
2021-06-21 02:40:49,"It can be fixed.  Fund it properly.  Stop letting the GOP get away with the lies it tells about science in general.  Take anything the GOP says about science and triple check it or ignore it.  They don't want to spend money on anything to begin with.  

Spend money on public health.  The return is in what doesn't happen.  Spend money on educating people about how science works; it's not mysterious at all.  

Don't ever elect another president like Donald Trump again.  The aftereffects of what he and his cult did will be with us for longer than his presidency."
2021-06-21 02:44:47,"I strongly disagree with the title of this article 'COVID-19 Proved the CDC is Broken...'   CDC was not the causative entity that was broken - Trump was broken and caused national damage. Early on before COVID-19 became a pandemic Nancy Messonnier and other staff at CDC sounded the alarm about COVID and what needed to be done - but they were promptly shut down by Trump. Trump then created an atmosphere for not wearing masks - because he was vain and didn't like how he looked in them - and promoted other cures such as bleach, hydrochoroquine etc. and affected the morality rate.  Do you think if Obama or even Bush were president the COVID outcome would have been the same - and CDC would have acted the same. No!       

CDC is part of the executive branch and reports to HHS through the federal government to the President. A larger question should be how to make CDC - and other science based federal agencies - more independent - so they aren't at the basis and whims and interference of politicians such as Trump. Similar to how the Attorney General position is supposed to be independent of presidential and political interference."
2021-06-21 03:17:17,Just finished Michael Lewis new book - Premonition where CDC is shown as incompetent and slow. CDC should be a research institution not the central health agency of the country. They are just not capable to handle crises as they need full information to move. Early in crises there really is not enough data and CDC is too afraid to make decisions.
2021-06-21 02:31:56,"Had the CDC been operating on the basis of science, mask mandates would have been tied to vaccination rates on a by county basis.  Once 70-80% of a given population is vaccinated, THEN it makes sense to lift mask mandates and fully open for business.   

But the CDC did not follow the science.

Instead, the CDC capitulated to political pressure, assigning an arbitrary date for ""opening up"" and creating cover for every anti-vaxer-anti-masker in the country to spread whatever variants of COVID may be available, keeping it percolating in the population indefinitely.

The entirely predictable result will be yet another surge fueled by the new highly infectious variants.  The victims will include not only the foolish and their loved ones, but also the immune compromised, and children.  In fact, every single child under 16 in our our country is at risk in the coming months before a vaccine for them is developed.

The coming tragedy is entirely predictable and preventable.  Current CDC leadership is clearly compromised and not up to the job.

Until we can get the political operatives out of the CDC, we are all literally on our own in this pandemic."
2021-06-21 03:37:06,"COVID-19 revealed every weakness, not just of the CDC, but every aspect of our society. How we do business, how we educate our children, how we do almost everything hangs on gossamer threads of person to person interaction that depend on the simple trust that we will not seek to harm one another. COVID-19 made that trust almost impossible when a ride in a subway, an elevator, or a meal in a restaurant could result in a fatal outcome. 

What could have made a difference was leadership. Instead of leadership we got the malignancy that was Trump enabled by the Party of Bad Faith that calls itself the GOP.

President Biden will try his best, but the damage that has been done is deep and will not be quick to heal. The Cold Civil War that has afflicted this country since the Newt Gingrich announced his “Contract On America” is the main reason COVID-19 came to these shores. We’ve already lost as many people to the Pandemic as we lost between 1860 and 1865. How many will be lost due to intransigent partisanship with future pandemics and climate change already at the gates."
2021-06-21 05:26:46,"The CDC has always been a starting point or intermediate stop for government and non-government personnel working on disease prevention. Refunding, as always is the ticket.

What made anyone think he wouldn’t do the same to the CDC through hack appointees and manipulation of early warnings before the disease was fully understood. 

Three years earlier he tossed out the pandemic plan book because... well... it was written under Obama. He the dismissed the pandemic advisory board for the president because... well... when was the last time there was a pandemic? 

Yes, the CDC has gone from an organization of world renowned expertise to one that is questioned at every advisory as politicized. It may be necessary to destroy the agency to save it. Trump loyal embedded civil servants may be impossible to root out any other way but create a new agency."

This generation's Apollo moonshot program is being provided by a South African immigrant, as he is being sued by a native born American.

As the article laudably points out, Trump wasn't even the main problem.  We are the problem.  And the better results under Biden are the ... duh ... predictable result of 12+ months of experience, so the new administration is nearly irrelevant to that."

I think the NYT has also published previous articles describing how state-level public health funding has been cut, how state and local public health officials have been threatened, and how many have resigned out of fear and exhaustion.  
Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb rightly emphasizes that diseases like COVID-19 need to be recognized as a national security threat.  We were just lucky that SARS-CoV-2 is so easy to vaccinate against, and fortunate that NIH has worked for decades to develop mRNA vaccine technology.  
More than 600,000 Americans have died in a little over a year, and our lives in areas with high vaccination rates are returning to normal.  Think for a moment where we'd be now if this had been the deadly and highly communicable influenza pandemic that scientists have been dreading for the last hundred years.  It's still coming."
2021-06-21 14:16:16,"The CDC is broken, but not because they are not omniscient. It is because they function primarily as a PR organization. 

Each time there is a public health threat, the first thing we hear from the CDC is “The most important thing is that people not panic.” I would argue that the most important ting is that the CDC be completely honest with the public. Get caught in just one lie and all trust is gone.

Prioritizing managing our reactions cannot be reconciled with total honesty, so the CDC spoon-feeds us euphemisms and feel-good nonsense. They course-correct moving forward, saving face through plausible deniability, claiming not to have known then what they know now.

With Covid, it was as though the CDC had no history and no bank of scientific knowledge. It was as though every aspect of disease control was being learned on the fly. Advice seemed intended only to mollify either politicians or the public.

The nadir was Trump's advising people to inject disinfectant to kill the virus, as the CDC's Deborah Brix sat nearby and didn't even flinch. 

If the CDC is to have respectability going forward, it needs to stop being afraid of politicians and of the public and tell the whole truth at all times.  

When public health threats arise, it's important that the CDC not panic."
2021-06-21 16:35:54,"The tenth amendment to the Constitution reserves to the several states all powers not explicitly delegated to the Federal government. Federalism is the root cause of the crisis the CDC finds itself in. It is the Constitution that makes the CDC  inefficient and ultimately impotent to combat foreign disease epidemics. In matters of Public Health, each individual state is sovereign.
That fact does not absolve the Congress and the Executive from the shameful from politicizing  Federal Agencies by executive action and Congressional legislation. Both these design flaws in American government make the Federal response to national domestic crises slow and inefficient. No state will ever voluntarily surrender is powers to the Federal Government. When a crisis becomes existential, all the Federal Government can ultimately do is seize power and authority from the “several sovereign states” until the crisis is over."
2021-06-21 16:55:59,"As I recall the first reaction to SARS-Covid-2 was to treat it like a national security threat.  The article fails to mention the supposedly botched test developed by the CDC, that early on all samples had to be sent to the CDC to be tested, and that the results were kept secret.  The mind-set that kept the public in the dark about the progression of the disease in early 2020 and failure to acknowledge that it was primarily spread through the air cost hundreds of thousands of people their lives.  It is as if a deliberate decision was made to allow the disease to spread as much as possible in secret before hospitalizations and deaths had to be addressed."
2021-06-21 16:13:11,"Americans in general are the undisciplined, uneducated, ill-informed, simple-minded suckers born every minute who seek and expect instant gratification.  Seemingly, Americans place more credence in astrology — or Qanon — than in the scientific method, which relies on an information-gathering process that requires both a structure for observation and a time-period for the assembly and analysis of data. Americans need to be reminded regularly of just how long the scientific/medical community labored to get a handle on HIV/AIDS (circa 1981 when it was first identified to about 1995 when a useful cocktail was finally becoming available) or Ebola (1976 to a useful vaccine in 2019.)  Of course the CDC needs to be updated — along with every state’s healthcare network — to form a coordinated and more effective system, but as importantly, Americans need to made more knowledgeable about how novel diseases are identified and treatment regimes developed."
2021-06-21 16:38:27,"Here's a thought experiment: suppose there were a much more lethal and transmissible version of the virus, one that resulted in a higher probability of death or serious disease among the unvaccinated of all ages. Would the CDC provide clearer public health guidelines than today? Perhaps. Would anti-vaxxers, and anti-maskers like Ron de Santis and his ilk pay more attention when they and their followers start to die in greater numbers? Doubtful - you can't fix stupid.

Well it's not a thought experiment: the delta variant is here, and the risk of worse mutations to come increases with every new case and every ill-considered re-opening. And fall is coming."
2021-06-21 16:42:03,"When it was about Trump the CDC could do no wrong. Take a good look at the numbers. It doesn't matter Red or Blue State. the numbers are to close to blame a political party. People have gone as far as to blame Trump for 600,000 dead. Are Merkel, Marcon  and Trudeau equally guilty in their countries of all the deaths?

When Fauchi lied about masks how many lives did it cost? It had nothing do with not issuing edict to wear masks until the virus was proven airborne. It was about fears of public hoarding. Keep in mind Fauchi is very old and a creature of a different era when government lying to the people for the greater good was normal.

It's hard to trust anything the government says but when science lies who do we turn to? Just my guess the CDC has plenty of brilliant scientific minds that stick with science. There's probably plenty differing opinions there but when a scientist turns politician, do you really trust politicians?

The situation is normal and it's all messed up."
2021-06-21 17:22:37,"Yes, Covid put the CDC through its paces; but you must look at the dismantlement of the agency by trump. He broke this government organization down as he did so many others.

Separate the science from politics!"
2021-06-21 18:32:30,Our narcissistic president abolished the agencies that studied pandemic preparation.  He wanted 'front stage' for the 'miracle' that would suddenly make the virus disappear.  It is called the hero syndrome when the arsonist gets credit for extinguishing the fire he started.  The CDC was intentionally decimated as many experts left the agency as they were silenced as Donald Trump took front stage.

According to their Alex Jones rumor mill, the attack on our Capitol on January 6 was fabricated by the F. B. I.   Every member of the Trump cult including the media backers belongs in prison.

While the smartest and wisest humble humane empathetic righteous honorable brave credible thing that the CDC could do is admit its ignorance about COVID-19 by saying ' We don't know '.

But the deeply rooted reality beneath the CDC failures is that every human organization institution is inextricably political aka social by nature and nurture.

People are DNA genetic African primate apes driven by evolutionary and sexual selection to crave fat, salt, sugar, habitat, water, kin and sex by any means necessary including conflict and cooperation.

2021-06-22 01:05:43,"It's interesting that this article doesn't mention one of the CDC's biggest missteps: the testing kits that were in short supply and didn't work.  The WHO had endorsed a test developed by a German lab and we could have started manufacturing that test, but the CDC decided to create its own test.  The CDC test had an additional component that would help distinguish Sars-cov-2 from other coronaviruses, but we probably didn't need that right then, we just needed a test that worked.  So people who had symptoms or had been exposed couldn't get tested and the virus spread while we couldn't track it."

I left the agency a few years before the pandemic, and nothing about their response has surprised me (other than the testing assay failure, I had thought the lab science was sound). I was taken in by its reputation and believed I would be working with leading experts. Not so. Many people at CDC are not working in their area of expertise (You advance in pay and title by taking different jobs within the agency, not by staying in one place e.g., people skilled in skin cancer research end up in enteric disease). It is a very southern culture, not diverse, and conservative. Much of middle management is there to rest on its laurels and have people bow down to them. There is virtually no vision or meaningful leadership.  When was the last time you saw a result from CDC on one of the US's issues: gun violence, opioids, violence against women, youth suicide (these are all the same center btw), poverty, meth, maternal mortality? 

Frieden's idea of of an exchange program is equivalent to the EIS which is in desperate need of expansion. CDC needs to: expand beyond Atlanta to attract more talent, expand its training programs & retain its trainees, work w/ experts on health messaging, and begin engaging politically to fight  for the resources it needs and to push public health solutions into policy."
2021-06-22 07:07:57,"As a retired high-school teacher, I can say that the single biggest problem in creating and administering sucessful school programs, whatever they may involve, is parental interference, whether individual or collective. Sometimes it’s well-meaning; sometimes it’s self-serving, but too often it is simply foolish and based on utter ignorance."
2021-06-22 20:51:44,"One of the biggest problems externally for CDC and for the federal government is the inability or unwillingness to enforce public health guidelines.  The idea of the school roadmap, for example, which included ""masks, proper ventilation and contact tracing"" looks great on paper.  But my child's school did not EVER require masks or provide actual distancing, did nothing about ventilation, and barely did any contract tracing.  Typically for every positive case in the high school, three people were quarantined.  As if a kid changing classes multiple times a day, often being assigned group work in those classes without masks or distancing, walking in the crowded halls, eating lunch in a room with hundreds of kids, playing sports, etc. would only have come in contact with three individuals in the whole day?  I am high-risk and I was terrified sending my child off every day.  The virtual options provided as an alternative were such poor quality it was unacceptable.  Where was the federal government when it came to ENFORCING the most basic public health guidelines in schools?  Our entire public health infrastructure is broken if the recommendations are just advisory and no one is accountable for implementing them."
2021-06-22 16:21:30,This is the story of a tragedy decades in the making about the painful decline of a proud institution that failed just when we needed it most. Literally. I have so many strong memories of working there for a decade between 1996 and 2006. We cried when our injury prevention director was fired by Newt and his gang and sang “Lucille” (Kenny Rogers) at his farewell event.
2021-06-23 21:42:54,"People, including politicians and many medical personnel, generally do not know the sometimes conflicting difference between the imperatives of medicine and public health. It is an important distiction when making policy, whether it's to mitigate a local outbreak of STDs or a pandemic. For instance, epi-treating for the clap is excellent public health policy but often not good medical practice.

In addition, massive bureaucracies are just that, massive bureaucracies, having the ability to adapt quickly to a new situation with all the flexibility of an aircraft carrier trying to hang a U. The C.D.C. is no different. As well, large bureaucracies tend to mitigate against optimum efficiency, as a culture of inertial tradition and turf wars almost always occur.

And then there's our current political climate of identity that prioritises peeing on a hydrant, self-labeling and claiming one's territory, over the public good. 

Further aggravating the situation, embracing almost all these days is the internet, whose business model is entirely clickbait, maximizing the economic advantage of divisiveness and outrageousness, as well as aggregating the rare into an image of commonality.

As to the fundamental cause and responsibility to change things for the better: well, that can be ultimately ascertained by looking in a mirror."
2021-06-25 18:53:12,"<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/magazine/cdc-covid-response.html?action=click&module=Top"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/magazine/cdc-covid-response.html?action=click&module=Top</a>%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
In the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has always been one of the most prominent subjects of debate and discussions. This article assesses in detail the history of COVID-19 in the U.S. and the C.D.C.’s actions on the issue. It  explains why decisions of the C.D.C as well as the Trump Presidency caused the uncontrollable spread of the virus. The author proposes that the methods to improve upon the current situation of the pandemic are largely up to C.D.C. 

In my opinion, the responsibilities and blames regarding this issue should not be pushed around. I believe that instead of discussing the responsibilities of a single or a few departments, we, both as organizations, infrastructures, and individuals, should focus on how to collaboratively solve the inconveniences caused by the pandemic, and how to adapt to the new norm quickly. This issue is not anymore about one individual, one department, or even one country. It is a global issue that requires collaborative effort to solve."
2021-06-25 14:08:04,"The CEDC helped cook the BMI books so now we have  an OBESE population.  Is a 5'6"" woman at 185 merely overweight? No but if you  tell her this is the  she will BUY more food.  The CDC knows  most people  have  few if any  symptoms except for the OBESE. So Fauci. never told Americans to stop overeating since  this is touchy.  The result is that most  GAINED even more weight.  NO need to fix the CC. In five years half the population will be invalided with diabetes. ."
2021-07-05 04:43:03,Everything was broken under Trump.  It will take time to repair the damage done.
2021-07-10 08:52:29,"The CDC, along with other parts of government, is beyond repair and should be replaced with something that works.  Too many CDC employees receive money from industries they are supposed to be regulating.  The EVALI myth they promoted is a good example.  People were getting sick from inhaling oil.   The illness is called Lipid Pneumonia and has   has been known for at least 95 years.  Regular nicotine vaping does not involve oil but two water soluble alcohols.  It shouldn't cause Lipid Pneumonia and didn't for millions of vapers that had been vaping for years without incident.  Despite this the CDC chose to claim the lung injuries were ""associated"" with normal vaping.  Their misinformation harmed public health but did benefit Big Pharma.  How do you fix an organization like that?"
2021-07-11 01:42:13,"I grew up in Atlanta and revered the CDC.  But when I was a young adult a story came out about the sad state of the facilities, such as refrigerators full of ""stuff"" that leaked out onto the floor.  I knew that was the stuff science fiction was made of, only this was the real world.  I respect CDC workers who rush to active Ebola outbreaks, for one example, and often give their lives.  The CDC needs to be perfected ASAP.  Another pandemic with a higher death rate could do us all in.  As an optimist I am counting on tis to happen and people to grow up and believe in science; it is not science fiction.  Kudos to those who did their part in spite of all the politics.  It is life or death, 600,000+ deaths to-date to be precise.  Heal thyself, CDC, and hurry up about it!"
2021-07-22 17:26:07,"I am a public health academic at the University of Washington, and saved this article to read carefully (sorry to be late in posting this). Here are my observations after working on CDC projects over the years:

1) CDC's hiring practices are so clunky that they've reverted to hiring through defense contractors, so people working ""for"" CDC are really employees of contractors such as Northrop Grumman. This can't possibly be a good idea.

2) CDC started to fail during the George W. Bush administration, when employees were prohibited from making any public statements until their remarks were cleared/censored by political appointees.

3) CDC retains a stranglehold on the peer-reviewed publication of findings by the scientists who receive grants from CDC. See an exchange of letters about this in the American Journal of Public Health: <a href=""https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302680"" target=""_blank"">https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302680</a>"
2021-06-16 10:30:48,"New York may be ending most of its Covid-rules, but here's something to remember.
A significant segment of the U.S. and world population remains unvaccinated, and with travel restrictions now being lifted, along with the raging Delta-variant across the planet, it wouldn't be unwise to take all congregant situations with an ounce of precaution.
It could be worth a pound of cure."
2021-06-16 12:24:35,"Other important NYC news:
There were significant subway delays on Monday.
Per MTA, crew shortages were the cause of long wait times on the A, B, C, N, Q, R and W."
2021-06-16 15:11:40,"""For the New York Philharmonic, there is an added challenge: The orchestra’s home, David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center, is in the midst of a $550 million renovation.""

An only-good-news development.  The workers win and the arts win.   This is great that the faith in the future of the arts is strong enough that the renovation keeps going full throttle, and stands as a symbol willingness to show belief in  the future live in-person concertgoing. And of course  construction work usually inures to the economic benefit of workers who are not already rich, so they really need the money too, even while at the same time the musicians also earn their living while the construction is going in."
2021-06-16 12:05:18,"""Some of the lowest vaccination rates are in the Bronx, where 57 percent of adults have received at least one dose, and in Brooklyn, which has only a slightly higher overall rate.

""In some ZIP codes in Brooklyn, including those that contain parts of the Canarsie and Midwood neighborhoods, less than 45 percent of adults have received at least one shot.""

Given that vaccination centers were put into the Bronx and Canarsie specifically for the benefit and convenience of ""minority"" communities -- I had to shlep miles to Canarsie for my shots -- it's practically miraculous that the vaccination rate is so low. 

As for Midwood, with its mixed population of Jews and others, where no vaccination centers were set up despite the presence of large high schools, all I can say (with disgust) is that there are fools of every color and creed. No wonder the city has become so dysfunctional. A stupid population that votes is not what our Founding Fathers had in mind."
2021-06-16 18:09:31,"""allowing vaccinated shoppers to walk the aisles without masks — will be up to individual businesses. Some may decide to keep them in place for the time being in order to help clientele and staff feel safer.""

--> Always great when decisions are based on subjective emotions instead of objective science. *facepalm*"
2021-06-17 00:35:10,"Ending some of the mask restrictions doesn't mean that the pandemic is over.  There will still be social distancing despite this.  I just hope that hearing about this new variant won't mean that a new pandemic will be starting.  Nonetheless, essential workers such as myself over at Fed Ex still have to face monstrous orders everyday and sometimes having to work longer than needed to keep up with it all.  On a side note, it would be nice if the parade on July 7 will include workers such me especially since I am one of those who didn't have the option to work from home like so many others who did.  Perhaps, there should be a special day for the working stiffs to show all the sacrifices we do just to make a living that so many just get handed down to them."
