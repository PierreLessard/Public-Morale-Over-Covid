2021-07-21 14:58:59,"A lot of people in high places have personally  invested in restaurants or have family members who did. So they think they are advancing their own financial interests when they allow restaurant dining without vaccine passports.  

Personally, even though I am vaccinated, because of the variants and breakthroughs, I don't feel comfortable eating in a restaurant that doesn't have vaccine passports. Their rush to max profits makes me wonder if they are violating other health regulations or if I will get a cold there. What they don't realize is that many of their old customers are not that fixed on the dining out experience. It is easier than ever to cook great meals at home, and then there is the takeout. So the only reason to eat in a restaurant is to see and be seen. But you can see crowds of people at lots of outdoor venues, or on television."
2021-07-21 14:52:21,"It's fairly obvious that ""back to normal"" is premature. The Delta variant, though not more deadly, is significantly more transmissible than previous versions.  People are acting like it's gone. Half the population is not vaccinated. Delta has taken over as ""the"" current infection in less than 6 weeks.  Many of the unvaccinated are following CDC guidance for the vaccinated, going without masks, risking themselves and others. Look at the crowds. Look at the unmasked. Many are simply lying & cheating. The piper's bill is coming due. This moment is too similar in virus growth numbers to March 2020. Don't let your guard down folks. Let's see what happens between now and Labor Day.  If people don't step up and get FULLY vaccinated, it's going to be a long year again, and too many won't see 2022."
2021-07-21 14:53:26,"Hopefully the right-wing liars weaponizing vaccines and masks for political gain are being ordered by their patrons to stop because it's cutting into business and the markets.  

Several of the Fox entertainers did a 180 recently and started exhorting their dupes to get vaccinated; coincidentally on a day the market was down 800 points on Delta variant fears.

Just like climate change, we'll see action when it starts to cut into profits."
2021-07-21 14:59:42,It's sensible approach to re-open. Can't live in lockdown forever and we are never going to reach herd immunity or eradicate covid.  And everyone is tired of 'boy who cried wolf' scientists and health experts. Let them live in their ivory tower and never out.

2021-07-21 15:05:00,"I think it's very irresponsible to open completely before everyone over 18 (or perhaps 12) has had ample time and opportunity to be vaccinated.  And some basic restrictions might need to become permanent (all bars, clubs, and places with indoor singing need excellent air circulation or filtration, public transit and similar settings maintain mask mandates, some events require 24-hour rapid antigen tests).  But eventually, the other restrictions will have to fall away."
2021-07-21 15:05:07,"""Personal responsibility"" is only helpful when the at-risk UNvaccinated individuals (at risk not only of getting sick but also more importantly spreading it to others including immunocompromised) actually follow the rules --> masking up, avoiding large gatherings, etc.  That's not happening; many chose not to get vaccinated AND are doing whatever they please.  Until they get vaccinated, or strictly follow all protocols to at least lessen the chance they'll continue contributing to the spread of disease, we're stuck with this AND it will keep mutating."
2021-07-21 15:00:55,The thing I don't understand is people's bravura in the face of the virus and timidity about taking the vaccine.

2021-07-21 15:15:17,"There has been plenty of messaging about the need to get vaccinated and plenty of time to do so.  The only people significantly at risk are those not vaccinated.  83% of those getting infected now are with the Delta variant which is highly contagious but, because symptoms are usually mild, has little impact on our medical facilities.  So, as one who has been vaccinated, I don't feel I need to be punished through closures because those unvaccinated may get a little ill."
2021-07-21 15:15:43,"I feel like we are at a tough cross roads right now. I've ended up believing months ago we have to learn to live with it, but within reason. Seeing hospitals fill up with the Delta variant due to areas with low vaccination rates isn't feasible. Able to live with it like the flu where it's there, it might cause harm on some, but it won't strain a system is feasible. 

Honestly the latter needs to be the goal, but when are we there? Obviously vaccination rates is one thing, but we have variants. Will they hold like they have for the most part? Or will the technology developed to make it a yearly vaccine like the flu shot?

I feel like we aren't there to accomplishing any scenario I mentioned, and I support steps to get back to normalcy. But this rush to normalcy keeps backfiring. Especially in certain parts of the world. I wish more people realize the risks involved over worrying about their bar meet up every night."
2021-07-21 15:11:21,Masks work - why not mandate masks instead of lockdowns?
2021-07-21 15:15:40,"While the idea of ""learning to live with COVID"" may work for developed nations, it will not work in the underdeveloped United States. In your country, members of your congress are at war with science. ""Know nothing"" senators accuse the Director of Infectious Diseases, Dr. Fauci, a physician-scientist and immunologist, of lying about the disease. That ignorant mentality foments rebellion and has resulted in under immunization in so called ""red states"".

Until your country implements minimum standards of education, experience and aptitude for congressional service, the rest of the world should restrict travel to and from America."
2021-07-21 15:15:51,"So people think they are now ready to put up with a certain level of serious hospitalization and deaths in order to have a ""normal"" life again. All well and good. But let's see what happens when some mutation or variant starts making younger children seriously ill or dying.￼"
2021-07-21 15:10:24,"Unfortunately, nothing has changed since last year. Viruses reproduce in ‘hosts’ and there are plenty of unvaccinated/unprotected to offer this kindness , free of charge, to the virus. I promise you, this is about as hard to predict as gravity. When was the last time you looked at the ceiling to see where the plate your dropped, landed?  We in Mexico and those in the US are on the same glide slope as last year, summer spike then huge sickness and death in November-February. Please ask yourself, what has changed ? Yes, fewer people are at risk, but millions and millions are available for the virus and it will find them. Managing this by measuring hospitalization rate or ventilator availability is practical for governments and maybe that’s all that can be done if the population refuses to protect itself. It’s frustrating all around, I guess"
2021-07-21 15:17:36,"We have widespread access to a highly effective vaccine. We are unaware of any variants that escape the vaccine. We are safe to resume normal life.  People who choose not to vaccinate aren’t going to be convinced if we just give it more time, and there are real social and economic consequences to continued restrictions."
2021-07-21 15:20:19,"Either the vaccines protect against severe outcomes, or they don’t. 
Either way, it’s obvious there is no role for further restrictions. 
I will say given the paucity of reports of reinfection, and the constant drum beat of positive cases after vaccination, natural infection indeed seems to provide substantially stronger immunity."
2021-07-21 15:20:51,"It's not a popular concept, but we are going to have to learn to live with covid-19.  When nations have a large portion of their population vaccinated, those people will almost certainly not die from covid.  There will always be people who refuse to get vaccinated, and a tiny percentage of them will die from covid, but that's not a big deal.  There is no shortage of humans, and what the world needs most of all is fewer humans, so really covid doesn't go far enough to help out the world in this regard.

We also have to realize that we will never get rid of covid entirely.  Last year it killed around 4 million people worldwide, or around 0.05% of the population, a tiny fraction.  This year it'll likely be around the same, next year it may drop to 2 million, and it'll keep decreasing.  I'd hazard it'll bottom out at under 300,000 a year, far less than yearly deaths from malaria or diarrhea, and at that point we'll start to ignore it.

We should move on from the pandemic, not because it's over, but because it's not important.  Climate change is our number one threat these days.  Covid is barely a threat at all, and I'm saying this despite having family and friends die from it.  We have to move on because there is no alternative, keeping things shut down will not eliminate covid either."
2021-07-21 15:46:15,"England is heading for disaster. Israel and the Netherlands both removed mask mandates, experienced dramatic surges with extremely short doubling times, and restored the indoor mask requirements within a couple weeks. 

The UK waited until there were about 65,000 cases a day with a doubling every two weeks, and then removed the mask mandates. 

Due to the lag between infection and detection, by the time they figure out their mistake, it is easily possible that there will be >200,000 new infections a day. And that is if they even do figure it out, because surely there is a limit to the number of PCR tests that can be done per day. So the number of detected infections must plateau at some point due to testing limitations, regardless of the actual number of cases.

Since hospitalizations are at about 2-2.4% of detected cases, the hospitals will  be overwhelmed by mid to late August unless they change course."
2021-07-21 15:18:23,"What's with you guys keeping the border with Canada shut for fully vaccinated people, but we are opening it up to fully vaccinated Americans Aug 9th?   As I see it, your people are more of a threat COVID wise than we are.   Your levels are starting to skyrocket because of Delta variant.  Yet our levels are dropping way down, and we have more people now fully vaccinated.   For the past month or more, your politicians at state and federal levels have been crowing at us to open our borders, and yet when we do, your fed gov decides to just keep it closed up???  You are a sovereign country to do whatever you please, but the optics here don't seem right."

2021-07-21 15:27:31,"The world is complicated isn’t it. The modern brings access to social media and all the short comings it engenders. Untruths and down right lies. I am stunned at acquaintances who have told me no vaccine under any circumstances. And they become part of the problem as we attempt to reach herd immunity. They are rolling casino dice. Maybe there is some truth to letting nature take over; the weak, infirm and old die off. I don’t want to inject politics here. It’s just that people are so confused by secondary and third person sources. It’s tragic. Here in Connecticut, I’ve taken to wearing masks again inside. Funny, as a you g senior, I stood in line for days in January waiting for extra doses at the end of the day. This was how important it was for me to get vaccinated. On the third day, my number struck. I was very pleased and my second Pfizer short occurred on Feb 10. A special day indeed."
2021-07-21 15:48:20,"We need to keep wearing masks. Cases matter. If large numbers of people are still getting infected, regardless of whether or not they end up in the hospital, we have increased opportunities for people to get long covid as well as for the development of new, vaccine smart, variants.  Evoution doesn't care if we are ready to move on.  If we keep masking up we would cut down on transmission, which is happening even among the ""safe"" vaccinated people.  Delta evolved in India because there were so many cases, not because of the number of people in the hospital or dying."
2021-07-21 15:45:44,"I'll continue wearing my mask although I am fully vaccinated. If a booster is required I will gladly line up for the shot. I am in no rush to be a guinea pig for bolstering consumerism and the restaurant business and I feel no need to be cheek and jowl with the rest of humanity. We need to plot a steady course to whatever ""recovery"" will look like but I m not onboard with treating the pandemic like a rolling electrical blackout."
2021-07-21 15:52:06,"So now we have to accept that infections are inevitable and concentrate on avoiding severe illness and death?  Where does that leave the immunocompromised and people with underlying conditions like cystic fibrosis, where even a “mild” infection can lead to severe illness and possibly death?  The message seems to be that such people are a burden on society and should either find a way to live in a cave or die and decrease the surplus population.  Charming."
2021-07-21 15:54:44,"Masks should continue to be essential.  It is not a difficult request to make. They become quite part of the daily clothing. Boris Johnson is a fool to open England completely when so many infections increase each day and lots of people only armed with one shot. Fortunately, we have a sane leader now; however the GOP needs to step up and convince the uneducated on the benefits of vaccinations."
2021-07-21 15:57:19,"Continued fear of the virus dictating one's life once vaccinated is almost as illogical as the people who were anti-mask when this all started. 

If you're vaccinated, your chance of serious illness is extremely low. As a society we cannot continue to impose upon responsible citizens for the sake of the obstinate who refuse to get themselves vaccinated.  If you live in the developed world, vaccines are widely available, free, and very safe. There is no excuse for not getting it.

At this point we should be treating Covid like the flu. We do not mandate masks and ban gatherings when flu season hits. Would it be great if everyone did wear masks to protect those who do get very sick and die from the flu?  Sure. But we haven't done that since 1918.

I've done my part. I masked when there was no vaccine. I isolated. I closed my business. But now it's time to move on. Those who choose not to vaccinate do so at their own peril. I feel bad for the immunocompromised and others who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons. But I have done my part to protect them. The responsibility for further spread falls on the shoulders of the irresponsible unvaccinated."
2021-07-21 15:59:47,I wore my mask diligently 100% of the time and still got infected with COVID in January of this year. And my mask was the professional-grade N95 that I was able to get through relatives who are doctors.
2021-07-21 16:07:18,"We shouldn't be talking about this as a stark dichotomy between lockdown or throwing caution to the winds. There's a vast and sensible middle ground.

It's now my habit to have a mask in my pocket, just as I wouldn't leave the house without keys or wallet. Though vaccinated, I routinely pop on the mask whenever I enter a store, or in crowded situations. For longer exposures like movies or airports, I switch to the less comfortable but more effective KN95. At restaurants, we choose outdoor seating when possible. This is close enough to ""normal"". As an added benefit, it's been over 2 years since I've had a cold."

  This zero-Covid fantasy is quickly becoming more of a problem just when the disease has become less of one. The variant argument just doesn't hold water when you look at the numbers and the empty hospital wards.
  Anyone is welcome to double mask, stay home, avoid human contact for however long they want. They don't have the right to force their fears on everyone else."
2021-07-21 16:00:56,"Shutting down economy for long term just to get rid of covid makes no sense considering we have vaccines that work now.

2021-07-21 16:14:49,"At the start of the pandemic last year, the public health call was to ""flatten the curve"".  We had a new and highly infectious disease with no available treatment, no vaccine and no evidence of natural immunity in the population.  Sooner or later almost everyone seemed destined to catch it so the idea was to keep the health care system from being overwhelmed in order to help as many patients through the acute phase of the illness as possible.  Now we have a vaccine and some treatment modalities, but unlike the Spanish flu, this one isn't going away.  We seem to be going back to the idea of flattening the infection curve while postponing the goal of COVID-19 eradication for now."
2021-07-21 16:19:04,Mask mandates are not coming back because the service and hospitality industry employees who had to enforce them for zero extra pay (and at personal risk) refuse to do it anymore.
2021-07-21 16:19:04,"While you mention it in your article, there is simply not enough focus on the long COVID issue in these risk-benefit analyses. Long COVID can mean a life of disability. So can a long and difficult ICU hospitalization. It is not just about numbers of deaths and hospitalizations. We are also in desperate need of studies evaluating whether breakthrough cases can become long COVID."
2021-07-21 16:19:20,"How's this for policy?

No government mask mandate.

No government vaccination mandate and even encouragement.  The vaccination is available if you want it.  Full stop.  No door-to-door.  

No government social distancing mandate.

On the flip side, there are consequences.

If you get Covid, you don't get to blame anyone other than yourself. And we don't want to hear your deathbed acceptance that the virus is real.

If you get sick and die, that's your choice.

More consequences. Businesses can choose not to allow you in if you're not masked and/or vaccinated. That includes airlines, trains, buses, sports and concert venues, etc. etc.  These same businesses can fire employees who are not vaccinated.  Private businesses.  Not the government.  Deal with it.

Hospitals can fire employees who choose not to vaccinate.

And, please, stop with the anecdotes about how you wore a mask and still got Covid.  You have no idea how many people did not get Covid because they wore masks.  So just stop it.

Same with the anecdotes about how you didn't get Covid and didn't wear a mask.  You were lucky.  That's all.  

Same with the ""I got a vaccination and still got Covid.""  Stuff happens.  You can get a flu shot and still get the flu.  It happens.  Sometimes symptoms are diminished, and the odds are lowered that you will die from it.  It's the nature of medicine and medical care."
2021-07-21 16:23:17,"The effects of restrictions on the economy have been grossly overestimated.  It is the state of the pandemic itself that affects the economy.  People stop or reduce discretionary spending and activites when they perceive that such activities could cost them their life.  The government mandates only work on the margin.  There are a few people who will be more worried about government sanctions than they are about death from the virus.  

However, for the pandemic itself that marginal effect can be very important.  If you go from 20% reckless behavior to 10% reckless behavior (as a result of restrictions) you can cut transmission in half.  For a pandemic an R0 of 1.1 vs 0.9 makes the difference between an out of control vs a disappearing problem.  

So restrictions (or not) has minimal effects on the economic loss but huge effects on the direction and outcome of the pandemic.  It's almost as if God has decided to punish those who think that human life and health is less important than wealth."
2021-07-21 16:26:41,"At this point in the United States, the refusal to get vaccinated is much more than an exercise in personal rights. It's a deadly imposition on countless people who must live with this purposeful and reckless disregard for personal responsibility. From directly infecting others to taxing the healthcare system, this is a decision that's costing real lives and precious live-saving resources. Having chosen this path, our public policy must treat them in ways that are reflective of their precarious medical status. 

The idea of the COVID-19 Passport was something that all of us recoiled at the beginning of the pandemic. We did so because we felt that no one in their right mind would refuse a life-saving vaccine if offered one. But, a confluence of factors made the unimaginable reality. For the sake of public health, something like a COVID-19 Passport is the only solution in a country where we have no other choice than to live with COVID. To do otherwise is to forfeit any ability to make meaningful distinction between Americans who are acting morally and in good faith and others who will not. If the consequences of personal decisions lie solely within that person, then why have prisons?"
2021-07-21 16:21:37,"Unvaccinated people need to feel pressure from society.  Require vaccine cards to be shown to patronize business and to return to the office.

What a dreadful time for the New York Times to run an invitation to let loose and pretend it’s over. Is there such a thing as journalistic malpractice?

Based on recent COVID numbers, heart disease, cancer, accidents, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, Alzheimer's and diabetes all take more lives.  Smoking  is a contributing factor in more than 1,300 of those deaths each day (including more than 100 due to exposure to second hand smoke), but no one in public health has suggested that we ban cigarettes.  

The tragedy of COVID is that it is far more easily preventable than all of the other causes of death.  Nevertheless, by now, anyone in this country who wanted a vaccine has had one.  If our friends in Alabama, Arkansas, etc. want to roll the dice with Delta, that's their decision.  I, for one, am no longer willing to accept disruptions in my life as an accommodation to right-wing ideologues and conspiracy theorists.

2021-07-21 16:54:24,"I continue to be frustrated by the NYT’s pro-lockdown bias. The sentiment of this article boils down to “rash politicians flying blind reopen countries as all knowing scientists warn of impending doom.” There are hardly any epidemiologists quoted on the other side of reimposing restrictions that believe countries should learn to live with the virus and that a mild/asymptomatic infection is not the same as disease. Contrary to the article's assertion that scientists do not understand how well the vaccine protects against variants, we know 99.5% of recent deaths have been among the unvaccinated. The truth is that everyone will get covid. The unvaccinated will be infected. The vaccinated will be infected. The only thing we are doing in countries with high vax rates is delaying inevitable infections. In countries like the US where the vax rate is high but the vaccination drive has reached an embarrassingly low plateau at 60% of adults fully vaxxed, I am afraid that buying more time for unvaccinated people with non pharmaceutical interventions (mask mandates, restrictions on gatherings) is going to have a minimal benefit. Many unvaxxed people simply won’t get vaccinated in the foreseeable future. Moreover, reimposing restrictions carries potentially high costs (more businesses close as people delay returning to normal activity, school closures in liberal areas, forcing young children at negligible risk of disease to wear masks and distance thus hurting their socialization)."

On the surface, lockdowns look like they save lives, but we might ultimately find out that they were responsible for more indirect deaths by other causes than they saved from Covid. It is worth staying a little humble before we condemn Australia for its hardline approach or other governments for trying to accommodate the virus."
2021-07-21 17:09:56,"Public health experts are understandably frustrated, but they are also cautious by nature and don't have to consider societal tradeoffs. While public health guidance is important to shaping policy, science is not a monolith and science can't tell us what to value. Unlike governors and other elected officials,  public health experts have a limited mandate...to track the virus and communicate recommendations about the virus...they are not elected officials so they don't focus on community values and societal trade offs which are at the heart of political decision making. Governors and other elected officials certainly should seek advice from public health experts, but also need to consult social psychologists, economists and education experts. The mood in much in the U.S. and other countries is shifting with covid hospitalizations dramatically reduced from six months ago, and protective vaccinations widely available to those that want it. Covid will be with us for decades (maybe forever) so at this point we need to learn to live with in the same way we live with other viruses while society functions."

I'm not going to ""let go"".  I try to be a good citizen and take personal responsibility for my well being -- so I'm vaccinated and I mask.  And while nations, states, and municipalities open up, I act prudently -- no movie theaters (I miss them), no concerts (I miss the Symphony), no air travel (I miss the East Coast) -- but yes to my well-managed neighborhood gym, yes to San Francisco Muni which requires masks, yes to re-exploring my beautiful city and finding new things that I love!"

One problem with the Stage 3 study was that the average participant age was 51, yet the average Fatality age was 85 and hospitalization age was 72  with a few comorbidities thrown in (Canada Data).

The Stage 3 effectiveness data was not correlated to the affected population (75 and older with comorbidity)."

2021-07-21 17:33:29,"“Living with Covid” is a bit of an oxymoron. 

Low vaccination percentages certainly affect the ability of a nation to reopen successfully without high infection rates.   Any nation - the UK, parts of the US, more - where vaccinate rates are too low is asking for a substantial increase in cases, a prediction borne out by day over day infection rates, hospitalizations, and deaths, almost all of which are among the unvaccinated. 

Unfortunately, the new variant has proven to be able to infect vaccinated people as well, though their lives may not be at as great a risk as unvaccinated people.   This, and the fact that there will be more variants due to unvaccinated people, is the most problematic part of the equation - pepple who have done the right thing are at risk from people who ignore science, preferring instead to think they are possessed of a secret knowledge about global vaccine cabals…."
2021-07-21 17:36:04,"It's been reasonably clear almost since the start of the pandemic that the coronavirus and its variants are going to be with us for a long time, perhaps forever.  Fortunately, it's a situation that can be managed through vaccination, and we have the pharmaceutical industry, aided by both government and academia to thank.  

(The American trial lawyers that threaten to bankrupt many drug companies are a major cloud on the horizon, and this country badly needs tort reform.  But that's a different conversation).

We need to decide how to manage vaccination, and people who decline to be vaccinated, and who thereby threaten both themselves and others.  My own feeling is that in a year or two vaccination should be more or less mandatory.  For years, hospitals have required flu shots for employees, and society effectively requires vaccination of children against preventable diseases such as measles.  There would be nothing new in requiring annual coronavirus vaccination.

Lockdowns are likely not the answer, except in truly egregious circumstances.  They likely do more harm than good.  The same is true for most travel restrictions.

Requiring masks in some circumstances is another complex question.  Masks clearly help limit spread the disease,  but they are uncomfortable for many.  Uncomfortable is a better alternative than covid, but masks are probably not necessary among the vaccinated."

‘Israel has pivoted to focusing on severe illness, a tactic that officials have called “soft suppression.”

Because not enough is known about the disease there are bound to be strong views on how best to face this monstrosity.
The competing considerations of economic survival versus those relating to our physical survival are equally difficult to adjudicate upon in a black or white manner. There need to be heavy shades of grey!
In a situation as trying as this what is essential is to have leaders who have qualities of mind and heart to be making honest decisions on our behalf. 
A nation can count itself lucky if it has an Angela Merkel or a Joe Biden leading it, but less fortunate if it is led by a Boris Johnson or a Modi. India recently sacked its Minister of Health for mishandling Covid-19 a week or two after its Home Minister had declared that Modi had solved the Covid 19 crisis!!

Pandemics and man made climate change occurs because of overpopulation.  The earth is attempting to right this man made attack.  It is good to have countries (or, as in the USA, some states) where ignorant leaders disregard science and tell their peoples to mingle freely during a pandemic.  In those countries and states, we are seeing in real time that many more uneducated minions are dying, than educated people that are being vaccinated and isolating.

The virus keeps circulating because of Fox News.  I can't help wondering, is it supported by Russia?  Is this part of their plan to weaken us?  If so, it's working wonderfully.  

Covid is a newer, I think, infectious virus for humanity.  If we can eliminate it before it mutates into something even more uncontrollable, we should do so.  Because it can be deadly or in some cases really debilitating, it's worth the effort to not give up and just live with it.  People already have to live with the threat of many other diseases and genetic conditions, even those that live very healthy lives.  Why add another very contagious virus to that mix that can be controlled with some effort.

I realize there are a great many people who have been politicized into being anti covid vaccines, however let's keep pushing a variety of messaging.  I understand a few Fox News commentators have even pushed vaccines.  All is not quite lost."

The rapid spread of the Delta variant could reverse the gains made in the wake of mass vaccinations. Even though breakthrough infection could be much lesser in its severity and it does not cause severe illness or hospitalization of fully vaccinated people, it is highly recommended not to get infected at all. 

According to health experts, it is smart to avoid getting even a mild case of the virus.  In other words, let us not consider ourselves completely immune or invincible after getting fully inoculated. The exact long haul effects of infections for the mildly infected are still unknown. Considering the known and unknown consequences, the benefits of wearing masks outweigh the risks of not wearing masks. Let us not lose sight of the fact that until 70% of the world population is vaccinated, we should not consider ourselves out of the woods yet. We are way far from it."

Having been fully vaccinated for almost 3 months, I am unwilling to wear a mask in any place that doesn't require it. Most local shops have effectively abandoned mask requirements, and lots of workers now opt to go mask-fee. Risks to vaccinated people are, literally, negligible. I am confident that I have a higher probability of getting hit by a car/delivery truck on my daily bike rides than contracting a severe case of covid. 

If people choose not to get vaccinated, so be it. If these folks get severe covid, well, it was their choice to assume a relatively high risk."

No matter what we do, we are never going to eradicate this virus nor will we prevent it from mutating into more infectious strains. Is there a risk of more people dying as a result - absolutely.

However, life is full of risks and this is just one more with which we will live.

As in, ""if they get sick, it's their fault."" But that isn't the reality. Children up to age 12 have NOT had their chance at a vaccine and are walking around adults who refuse to mask while an an increasingly dangerous mutation makes its way through the unvaccinated. We kept kids away from friends and school for a year to protect the community. Now, when they need protection, I see people shrugging them off like they don't matter."

I am fully vaccinated for the past 4 months and live in the Marin County CA which has one of the lowest Covid rates in California but I always carry my mask and put it on whenever I am shopping or unable to maintain social distancing . I will admit I am not wearing my mask at the gym because there are not many people who have returned and of course you cannot use a mask in the swimming pool . But, I blame the rise of the cases again on those who are unwilling to get vaccinated. The world was able to wipe out Smallpox by herd immunity . I admit that COVID is not Smallpox but if we really got 85to 90% of the world population vaccinated the virus would lose its ability to mutate and do such damage. So what is needed is a bold approach 1- relax the patents that the vaccine manufacturers hold and allow reputable pharmaceutical companies world wide to share the formulas and produce vaccines. 2- Continue to push the need for vaccines. I also think people who refuse to get vaccines when they are offered should not be allowed in public places and vaccines should be required for anyone entering a hospital or medical center , except of course if you are now infected with COVID because you decided not to follow the science."
2021-07-21 18:11:27,"Children are extremely, extremely low risk, so continuing restrictions on their account doesn't make sense, especially since restrictions on school are harmful to them. 

The UK's new policy makes it plain: Kids under 18 aren't being offered the vaccine unless they are medically vulnerable. A few other European countries have taken the same approach.  The UK just released new data showing that childhood deaths and long covid cases were dramatically lower than previously thought.

In the US, there is no reason to continue restrictions when children are at such low risk and when adults can protect themselves with a vaccine."
2021-07-21 18:13:25,"The decision to ""live with covid"" is based on counting only those cases that result in hospitalization or death. Inconveniently, covid is not like the flu, where those who survive continue their lives without lasting effects. A large percentage of covid survivors have long covid, ranging from debilitating exhaustion to devastating damage to their lungs, hearts, kidneys etc. Long covid happens to people who have only had a mild case, and can even happen to young people. Breakthrough cases among the vaccinated can also lead to a permanent loss of quality of life. I'm most horrified that younger people could be damaged and impaired early or midway through their lives.

We have a mutation - Delta - that infects vaccinated people. We are hearing how many of the vaccinated who are infected are ending up hospitalized, but not how many vaccinated are infected, or the percentage of the vaccinate who become infected and are hospitalized.  

Read the statistics carefully: less than 2 percent of those hospitalized are vaccinated. But what percentage of the vaccinated are diagnosed positive - 33%, say the Israelis re Pfizer - and what percentage of the vaccinated are ending up in the hospital? Those percentages tell the story.

If the virus mutates to escape those vaccines completely, we are back at square one; we will need to develop a booster that addresses the variant, and vaccinate everyone again.  Is that what we want? 

My family is shopping indoors again when needed; my spouse is back to on-site work when there is no alternative. But I’ve just received an order of KN-95 masks and hand sanitizer. We are being careful, because we are not volunteering to become “unavoidable losses.”

I'd be happier if this phrase meant that testing would be implemented in schools with unvaccinated children, if masks would be utilized where breakouts occurred, if people limited the size of gatherings and improved fresh air circulation in buildings.  I'd be happiest if it meant that more people accepted vaccines where they are available to slow or stop the disease spread.  I'd be satisfied if ""learning to live with it"" meant that people would act like intelligent and responsible beings.

Instead, I fear that what this really means is that we just go back to pre-COVID routines and accept the negative consequences.  To me, this is defeatist and is a losing strategy.  Imagine if we accepted this sort of strategy in business, sports, education, or other areas of life.

We should be ending all international travel and severely restricting even national travel. There is no reason for most of this travel, especially if it’s fostering the spread of covid."
2021-07-21 19:02:45,"It appears to be all we can do. So long as safe and effective vaccines, along with boosters calibrated to any new variants, are readily available to those of us who want them, I guess we have no other feasible option. It is a pity that so many refuse to get protected, but we cannot allow them to hold the rest of us hostage to their science denial and conspiracy theories. Hopefully, with time, more will see that those of us vaccinated are not turning into zombies nor dying nor are infertile and will get vaccinated."
2021-07-21 19:05:08,"The virus will remain utterly indifferent to petty human politics and continue to mutate as it replicates.  Humans have never learned to live with MERS or SARS, but I guess some are going to give it a go for SARS-2.  We probably need to rethink the phrase ‘avoid it like the plague’ as we don’t seem to be very good at doing this…"
2021-07-21 19:10:03,"Don’t expect an economic recovery under these circumstances. There are many people with genetic and autoimmune conditions, other immunocompromised people like cancer survivors and organ transplant recipients, and people with other underlying health conditions who are at risk of long haul Covid and even hospitalization if we get Covid-19. We will continue to mask and physical distance. I avoid going into any retail establishment that doesn’t require masking. My genetics are not my fault. Living a healthy lifestyle, which I do, does not cure genetic or autoimmune conditions, even if it helps. But the rest of the rich world is now abandoning its disabled and chronically ill citizens. If society can’t handle this pandemic well, I doubt it will handle climate change well, either. Our pyramid scheme of a global economy is going down. Check in on your disabled friends and find out how they’re feeling right now. Check in on your friends who are low paid frontline workers and see how they’re feeling, too. Both groups are not happy to see business-as-usual return without regard for our health or wages."
2021-07-21 19:13:51,"What we might ultimately find is that we cannot eliminate the virus without infection-induced robust T-cell immunity.  Even then, the virus will become endemic, like the other coronaviruses that have become endemic in the past.

What the vaccines do is keep us safe, as we no longer have a fairly high chance of dying or becoming permanently debilitated by a severe infection.

In a sense, the people who refuse to get vaccinated are now doing the rest of us a favor, by providing us with a pool of virus that will allow us to rapidly acquire full immunity, not only a primarily humoral response to the spike protein.  The latter is very effective in reducing viral load and thus disease severity and duration, as well as ability to transmit, but on its own it confers no lasting protection.

The good news is, that, although this course of what has to happen is unavoidable, getting it over with quickly now will shorten the pandemic in Western countries with a high vaccination rate considerably.

I salute the anti-vaxxers who are literally willing to sacrifice their lives, so that the rest of us can be durably protected  faster.  I also salute Trump and the GOP for recruiting all these moribund volunteers.  Joe Biden would never have been able to do it."
2021-07-21 19:15:14,"Why does the New York Times keep pushing this perspective that COVID cannot be beaten, so we might as well - what? - just enjoy a few sniffles once in a while and keep partying?  Reports like this belong in the opinions pages, not in ""the news.""

First, let's recognize that the means exist to eradicate the virus, as we have eradicated many other diseases; what is lacking is strong leadership and citizen  responsibility.

Second, despite the reduced dimensions of the problem in the United States, deaths remain on a pace to routinely triple the annual flu figures.  Are we to just welcome that as progress?  And what about the raging outbreaks around the globe?  Are those countries supposed to ""accept a new normal"" of incubating new variants that will quickly propagate to the rest of the world?

Third, if everyone adopts the stick-fingers-in-dike policy of ad-hoc shutdowns to put out random outbreaks, we may as well say goodbye to any new normalcy in supply chains or employment.  The new normal will be a chaotic economic environment that accelerates the massive transfer of wealth from the bottom 80 percent to the top 1 percent.

Please, NYT, try to be part of the solution.  Articles like this are decided not helpful."
2021-07-21 19:03:51,"I was encouraged a bit by Fauci’s change in demeanor when addressing Rand Paul.  We need to stop coddling and making accommodations for anti-vaxers.  There needs to be consequences for not vaccinating and that means vaccine passports.  We’ve gotten to the point where rather than stopping Typhoid Marys from cooking, we’ve stopped the rest of us from eating."
2021-07-21 19:17:39,"The vaccine is available now in many areas of the world and  intelligent people have gotten their free doses already.

2021-07-21 19:28:12,"‘To be vaccinated or not to be vaccinated, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take a jab in the arm against a sea of troubles.’

Let’s do a thought experiment.

Let’s compare getting a jab with wearing car safety belts across the US.

Let’s say, tomorrow, in all US states, it is no longer mandatory to wear car safety belts.

Acceptable? Of course not.

A great stride in individual freedom? Choice? Maybe, but the accident compensation lawyers would have a field day - on both sides. 

Also, and much much more important:

The great and correctly sought after personal freedoms during life, will seem less so at death.

And, the resultant new and significant levels of physical injuries, both permanent and temporary, not to mention dislocation to economic and social wellbeing for individuals, their families and local communities, will remind us, one and all, that there is no such thing as a free freedom lunch.

As with car belts, so with vaccination in a global pandemic in the 21st century.

In some rare situations, freedom comes with no choice."

2021-07-21 19:22:58,"The billions of unvaccinated people are breeding Covid variants that may overwhelm Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.  That is an existential threat to humanity.  The US, the EU, India, and China should stop squabbling and save the world."
2021-07-21 19:26:26,"It’s sad that your reporter seems to think that unvaccinated people must wear masks in California.  Enforcement consists of posting a sign outside the business making that request, but there is no verification, and no way of knowing if unmasked people are simply lying.  Case rates are increasing in the state. Even in places where masks are required, there is often no one asking those wearing their mask under their chin to cover their nose and mouth.  A recent poll showed that the unvaccinated have no problem walking maskless past signs asking them to mask.  With this attitude and the Delta variant, we have become a breeding ground for new variants, which will almost certainly cause increases in cases and deaths.  Breakthrough cases among the vaccinated are another potential breeding ground for vaccine-resistant strains.  Selfishness and denial ensure that Covid 19 will be with us for a very long time."
2021-07-21 19:34:35,"""Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, said that countries taking shortcuts on their way to reopening were putting unvaccinated people at risk and gambling with lives.""

This passage could have been much more clear. Which countries and ""shortcuts"" is he referring to?

If we are talking about countries where the vaccine is widely and easily available, people who could get vaccinated but stubbornly refuse to are putting their *own* lives at risk. And the rest of use should not be expected to wear masks forever to accommodate them."
2021-07-21 19:44:38,"I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, we (meaning all of humanity) have the means to eradicate covid, and many other diseases as well, but we lack the political, intellectual, and moral will to do so. This is rightly viewed as an enormous failing and tragedy. 

On the other hand, there are way too many humans on planet Earth, by perhaps a factor of 10. Truth is, our way of life is unsustainable. Covid is a corrective, and climate change is making itself felt more and more every day. Humanity also lacks the will to deal with that problem. I thoroughly believe that covid is not the only mass casualty event that I will witness in my lifetime. Given humanity's unwillingness to make hard choices, my focus is turning more towards preparing myself and my family to weather the coming storms."
2021-07-21 19:55:45,"I believe US undermined the impact of Cordiv when Trump was in power, we paid a heavy price. And then Democrat used Cordiv effectively defeating Trump in the election.

That is very very sad reality. To live with Cordiv is not a solution to Cordiv, which is still very dangerous disease."

2021-07-21 20:06:23,"Learning to live with Covid intelligently as opposed to hysterically is rational.

All those who have contracted Covid (positives) have been shown to have antibodies for at least 8 months ... those need to be added to the vaccinated population to have a better view of the situation. 

When there are near 40,000 positives for around 240 deaths we are not in a pandemic situation any more. 

Care must be taken (distancing and mask in crowded, closed areas) but shutting everything down is not the answer."

There is zero effort to enforce the mask requirement - not even announcements about it on the trains - and I've seen plenty of MTA workers riding without masks.  

It's difficult to imagine Midtown roaring back - with the packed worker ridership of pre-pandemic days - under this state of affairs and with Delta on the rise."
2021-07-21 21:13:09,"Learning to live with the virus sounds suspiciously to me like a graceful surrender, far from the wartime rhetoric early in the pandemic of defeating an enemy.  Soon we will learn to live with the wildfires, drought, flooding and other extreme events wrought by climate change.  Unspoken is that we will learn to live with it, except for those who die.  We are not showing ourselves to be the strong, admirable, intelligent species we tell ourselves we are."
2021-07-21 21:17:37,"The  current  state of affairs shows the limits of government to lead its people when it comes to a public health crisis.    The failure is surprisingly widespread across all sorts of culture and government, no matter left or right.   

Before this pandemic I would have thought the educated world would respond to  such a global incident with more respect for our shared responsibility.   I mean  what is so special about getting back to normal if it just means eating inside a  restaurant, eating in a movie theater, eating in a buffet on a cruise ship?

I need to see to believe.
I was a latecomer in realizing the impact of covid at the start. Life changed in March 2020 when NY became an epicenter.
Now, I will take the information as given by various sources but prefer to use some hard won common sense about these 'waves' of infection by using the experience of caution.
When I was a kid I used to wonder about why ""as long as you have your health"" was the barometer of life being good according to my parents and their friends. I have lived long enough to understand it and I am holding on to it as long as I can, regardless of the rush to return to pre-Covid normal.
Just saying."

2021-07-21 21:48:30,"Like the seasonal flus, COVID is here to stay; I think elimination of the virus is somewhat unrealistic for the foreseeable future. Just as it took WW2 for radar to be deployed, it took a pandemic for us to start using MRNA tech. Better vaccines will come - we may need an annual jab. Better therapeutics (preventative and for treatment of the disease) are on the way and will be used by at-risk individuals in the same way gay men take PreP or PEP to prevent HIV infection. The third leg of the stool is faster and more accurate testing that can be done at home. With those three, we will be able to co-exist with COVID. We're almost there in the US.

At this point, our default must be to err toward re-opening unless hospitals are nearing capacity, with some mask rules when appropriate. We simply cannot afford the social, political, economic, and health & mental health consequences of shutting down again; it was not true that shutdowns were costlier than the virus a few months ago, but today they are. The data on Delta strikes me as somewhat encouraging. Yes, ~34% of fully vaccinated people can get the virus, but ~99% of those people do not become severely ill or die. That is not a bad outcome by any stretch; it makes COVID like the flu. Delta will be a crisis for unvaccinated communities, and in the US, the unvaccinated have a choice: take extra precautions, get vaccinated, or be reckless."
2021-07-21 22:02:07,"We have a glut of vaccines in the country, while 44% of the 12+ population is not vaccinated. I don't think the majority of those unvaccinated are ever going to get one, and we can keep waiting for them. 

The sensible thing is to fully open the country, and let the virus ""rip"" through -- which basically means that many of the unvaccinated will get infected. But the same will happen whether we do a slow opening or a full opening. At least if we open fully, the virus will rip through and we'll mostly be done in two months."

2021-07-21 20:11:10,"I was both careful and lucky, never caught Covid, and am now fully vaccinated.

What I did ""catch"" was a medical diagnosis of both anxiety and depression, and prescriptions for medications for both. I watched most of my friends (my social circle is disproportionately international, full of actors and theater people and people in travel-dependent occupations, and heavy on people with nonimmigrant work visas) have their lives and livelihoods completely ruined - many have lost all their income for over a year - by lockdowns and shutdowns and travel bans. I had my own family of choice ripped apart by Trump's and then Biden's travel bans and bans on issuing visas to the Schengen countries (educate yourselves on this, dear readers, please) and do not know if or when my partner and I will ever be allowed to live together in the same country again. I have nightly nightmares and frequent intrusive thoughts of wishing I would just die in my sleep.

So I would politely request certain commenters to consider how many people are being harmed by the shutdown of society, in addition to the virus itself. When you advocate for permanent ""new normal"" or insult anyone who wants their lives back as childish or selfish or Republican, picture me staring blankly into my bottle of antidepressants, my partner just pixels on a screen, everyone I know in abject despair."

This is untrue, though some of them are being imposed by different means. We are by no means free in this country while this government remains in place. In fact, they've just made it far harder for those living outside the country to come home for the holidays - many, many Brits live in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and now crazy quarantine rules mean they are not subject to isolation if they come by plane, in close contact with many, but they are if they come all the way in their own car apart from others because they have to catch the Eurostar train at Calais and Johnson is engaged in tit for tat nonsense with France."

So, in an American context where all the vulnerable could have rolled up their sleeve long ago, what again is the argument for returning to restrictions? A quote from an expert about our case would have been helpful!!"
2021-07-21 20:13:22,"It is getting ridiculous to continuously cite the uncertain possibility of a new variant against which vaccines are ineffective as a  perennial justification for lockdowns.

These pages have repeatedly stated that full vaccination of the Pfizer or Moderna is extremely effective against all known variants.

Some new variant ""might"" mutate some day, but no one can tell you what the odds of that happening are because no one knows.  Many past viruses have also mutated to become less deadly.  There also ""might"" be a brand new pandemic anytime, are we just going to stay shut down forever in anticipation of that?

Because of our capitalistic greed, a huge portion of the developed world will be unvaccinated for years to come, spurring new variants that can reach any country that has not totally closed its borders.  Even the most ardently pro-lockdown must have some threshold after which the tradeoff seems no longer be worth it; 3 years? 5? 10?

The situation for developed countries is very different than in spring 2020 when all of sudden we realized infections may have been spreading undetected for weeks, some hospitals were overwhelmed, no medical workers were vaccinated, care homes were extremely vulnerable etc... In many developed countries vaccines are now widely available to all adults and the most vulnerable seniors and medical workers have nearly all had an opportunity to get the vaccine.

Don't make lockdown a new way of life while forgetting its original justification."

2021-07-21 22:51:56,"I might get vicious feedback here, but I must ask a very fundamental philosophical and moral question, which I think needs to be confronted by all sides of this issue.
Why have we assumed that saving lives must take precedence over preventing economic harm, perhaps severe harm? Is the ability of a person to have a job and sustain their family always subservient to saving a life. 
Let me express the moral question in  personal terms. I am 77 years old. I do not want one, not one, person to have to sacrifice their livelihood to benefit me, even if it means saving my life.  I suspect that many people, when asked if they want someone else to suffer economically to save their life, would answer similarly.
Conversely, how many of us would sacrifice our livelihoods to save the life of another? I'll bet a significant number would not want to sacrifice our family's  economic sustainability.
The question of whether saving lives or saving livelihoods becomes far more complex when viewed on a personal level. It is a very complicated moral decision, and I don't think the answer is obvious.
So many people start their comments with the assumption that society must endure economic harm if that is required to save lives. I challenge that premise. I don't profess to know the right answer. I suspect there isn't one. But the question must be asked and debated before we ever summarily inflict  severe economic pain on society again."

In spite of the positivity rate rising above the redline (10%), Gov. Abbott has said that there will be no mask mandates, because requiring vaccinated and recovered folks to wear masks would be an undue hardship. 

I'd say that Abbott is abdicating his responsibilities, but I can't find (with a quick look) anywhere in the TX constitution that safeguarding Texan lives is one of his responsibilities. 

According to The Texas Tribune, since February, roughly 9000 Texans have died, and of those, all but 43 were unvaccinated.

To put things into perspective for the international readers, Australia have had approx 920 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. 800 odd of those were in Victoria (last year) and the significant majority (over 98%) were the elderly or the health / immune compromised or had significant health issues. 

In Australia pre covid: 
- We experienced over 3000 deaths a year from influenza. We don't lock down. Yet not one single report of a death from this last year.
- Heart disease is our biggest killer yet we openly sell sugary foods / drinks / don't promote healthy lifestyle (and the gyms are the first workplaces shut because they're such high transmission risks)
- Over 1100 people lose their lives annually on our roads yet we still get behind the wheel everyday

Will this ""don't worry, it will only be mild"" hold true now that people are out and about without masks and failing to social distance?  Only time will tell.  We are still in the midst of a pandemic and nothing can be dismissed or said with certainty now beyond WEAR A MASK, whether you are vaccinated or not.

In England, with the Delta variant rampant, there have been no reported deaths from Covid of vaccinated people under 50. 

The vaccine works. It’s one thing if you live in a country where vaccines are hard to come by, and one can argue that everyone should continue to take precautions. It’s another thing in a country like the US where at this point anyone can get vaccinated and people choose not to based on politics or whatever.

2021-07-21 23:30:13,Perhaps what we need is health care strike until vaccine rates hit 90%. I wonder if that would persuade people.

The surest way to save the planet and all lifeforms on it, including our own, is to manage the explosive growth of homo sapiens. Call me callous, call me cruel, but from a long-run, global perspective concerned with the survival of all forms of life, this pandemic and other checks on human population growth are a blessing in disguise."

2021-07-21 23:43:33,"I guess risk is personal.   I'm a road cyclist.  I biked 12 miles each way to my job in DC for over 30 years.  I got hit by a car once and hit a slick spot, fell, and broke my pinky.  In my late 60s I still am a roadie.  Many people say to continue, while others ask whether I'm being a risk taking nutjob.  The latter ask what would happenl to people who care about me if I were to die in a bike accident.  They remind me my actions have consequences that affect others. They are right of course. But cycling is my passion.  To me it's worth the risk. I may a selfish jerk, but anyone who takes risks of any kind may be so condemned.   All of us, even the safest, die, and in doing so, leave someone brokenhearted.  We are entitled to live our lives."
2021-07-21 23:47:51,"People were misled from the beginning. They were given the impression that if only everyone wore their masks (or two masks) perfectly, social distanced with others all the time, did not touch their faces unless completely necessary, washed their hands all the time etc. this flu-like virus would not spread. A cure for the flu, basically. The reality is that even twice-vaccinated health professionals with full body PPE sometimes got infected anyway. Yet every new handful of cases reported was seen as a failing of the public in following the rules. The truth is only vaccinations work and even then, to a point."
2021-07-21 23:49:32,"I'm not sure even Dr. Fox News could convince people to wear masks at this point.  

Let's just hope the natural selection  process has some kind of algorithm that includes idiocy in its determination of who lives and dies."
2021-07-21 23:49:52,"This is no time to ""get used to"" breathing germs.  There is much we can all do to continue to protect ourselves, and we should. 

Studies in Israel and Britain place protection efficacy for mNRA vaccines against breakthrough infection by Delta at 65% and 80% respectively. It is currently unknown how often these break though infections lead to long haul Covid. 

There are professional grade anti-viral masks that (KN-95 and N-95) that contribute to a robust defense. These masks have been keeping nurses healthy in Covid ICUs for months. 

N-95 masks are made in the US and are all FDA approved. KN-95 masks are made in China and many are FDA approved. 

Both kinds are readily available on line. Both are sturdy and reusable. I would throw one away only if I was coughed on or was the victim of a nose to nose argument. 

My mask is my seat belt. My vaccination is my airbag. Protected by both."
2021-07-22 00:09:04,"Why didn’t the author cite China as taking the opposite tact?

China previously announced that border restrictions (ie international travel to China) will stay in place until mid 2022, and likely Macau and Hong Kong will follow. 

The country also recent took significant (and very public) steps towards reducing the (monopoly-like) power of the giant e-commerce, social media companies. 

So it appears that China sees these two risks (covid, unregulated data, etc) as being significant…..and it is seizing the opportunity to take them head on while the other western powers appear unwilling, unable to cope. 

Of course, Western media has taught the world to be skeptical of the Chinese Govt, but with a track record of success over the past thirty years beyond compare (economic, social progress), it seems that affording China ‘the benefit of the doubt’ would be a reasonable course of action…."

2021-07-22 00:14:17,"Drs Hack, Wheeze and Gasp's program for covid management seems to have won the contract. 

Last last year's freakshow, maskless midwesterners waving their AR-15s around and screaming about their freedumbs, crowding into churches by the busload, licking the pews, plotting to kidnap governors, etc., was disheartening. My theory now is that that for the USA, pleading will be the only real option going forward, such as asking people to PLEASE wear masks indoors when numbers get high, and expecting that a sizable minority won't comply. 

The ""rolling lockdown"" idea seems likely to become the favored strategy, where we try and keep hospitals from being inundated, like the ones in India did earlier this year. I'm anticipating this to be an interesting fall in the lightly vaccinated southern states, Wyoming, and Idaho, though not as bad as last fall. Less developed countries seem on course to get hammered for several more years."
2021-07-22 00:15:58,"Having lockdowns is easier said than done, the reality is that no public deficit will be sustainable enough to end this pandemic through such a strategy, we definitely have to start looking at this issue from a personal responsibility lens."
2021-07-22 00:18:29,"People this is 5th Grade Math.

Go to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard. 
Divide Cumulative Deaths by Cumulative Cases.
Last time I did this the COVID-19 Death Rate (Case Fatality Ratio) was 1.78% (or 0.0178 in Decimal Form).

Divide 0.0178 by the Death Rate of the Common Flu (1/10th of one percent or 0.001 in Decimal Form)

You will see that the Death Rate of COVID-19 is over seventeen times that of the Common Flu.
(seventeen point eight)

So if COVID-19 were like the Common Flu, the American Death Toll of about 608,000 would be ""only"" 34,000.

But it's NOT 34,000 it's 608,000 or 610,000, I don't check the numbers every day.

But do you think you can ""live with it"" the way we ""live with the Common Flu""???

THINK AGAIN.

This is how Empires fall.  

Russia and China are laughing at us, as we slowly commit national suicide by COVID-19, since many of us do not think we need to get vaccinated.

This is High School Biology:

The more unvaccinated people, the more probability that the original COVID-19 infects someone and then mutates into an even worse mutation than Delta.
Let's call it ""Epsilon"".

Then Epsilon might infect and kill the fully vaccinated.
And all the work that President Trump did with Operation Warp Speed will go down the Drain as we go back to Square One.

If Trump were still POTUS, Tucker Carlson et al, would be telling people to get Vaxed.

But Tucker does not want Biden to have a victory over COVID-19 so he makes $6 million a year telling lies."
2021-07-22 00:19:05,"The science has been saying for a long time that COVID is endemic and we need to learn to live with it.

2021-07-22 00:45:34,"I have no trouble limiting my behavior to prevent infection. I will continue to wear masks and will not attend any indoor activity without a mask. 

That means no restaurants indoors where I will have to take off my mask to eat. The only other time I would have to take off my mask is at the dentist and I will be postponing that appointment. 

I will not get on a plane and will not attend any indoor entertainment where there are too many people for social distancing. 

I am fortunate that I can continue to live this way, working at home or at my office with only one other person and both of us masked. Any other place I go, the grocery, the bank, etc. I am not there long and can be distant and keep my mask on. 

I live alone and only see one other person in my home. I'm prepared to live this way for another year or so."

97% of cases are unvaccinated and about 95% of hospitalizations are unvaccinated. If you can't do math then good luck."

2021-07-22 01:12:11,"Well, OK then. I suppose “learning to live with it” means that we will stick to the habits we’ve developed over the past year and a half: no travel, no restaurants, no movie theaters, no clubs, no bars, no indoor concerts, no museums, no gyms, no yoga studios, no crowds, and masks in the grocery store or coffee shop. Sorry, business world, but it looks like we won’t be spending much money again this year. On the bright side, it’s much easier to pay down debt, with all of our activities so limited."
2021-07-22 01:18:54,"I’d like to know how many of the NYT commenters who seem to have internalized the fight against covid and are unwilling to accept any risk on Covid are conflicted because they used to have a long commute, or really enjoy working from home, or enjoy spending time in their country house upstate or the Berkshires. 

The NYT readership, skews heavy towards educated professionals—the group LEAST impacted by the lockdowns and least likely to benefit from a return to normalcy.  Throw in the retired, and I bet that’s a major chunk of the people saying we need to hunker down until Covid completely disappears. 

Tne vaccines work. Fools who choose not to take them should not drive policy. Children under 12 are not any serious risk and more of tjem die each year from stupid accidents than died from Covid."

Delta variant has hugely changed the game in Australia where unfit for purpose quarantine facilities and procedures have been exposed. Vaccine availability is now starting to ramp up and more so from September. Maybe too late though.
I do not see anything positive in the US or UK 'opening' as the cases are surging again - and in the UK this was even before 'freedom day'  - surging cases equals opportunity for mutation.
This is a global pandemic and the vast majority of the world population has not been (and can not yet be) vaccinated. 
We need to stop thinking about our immediate gratification"
2021-07-22 02:27:06,"It's like us humans refuse to learn. India was normalizing COVID too, before things fell apart in a dramatic way. The problem with normalizing this pandemic is that runaway transmission will most definitely give rise to variants.

True freedom is the ability to thrive and be happy regardless of any temporary limitations required in the moment."

But since the USSR collapsed our ""leaders"" (Gingrich especially here) have lost all shame about it and no longer even make the pretense of trying to live up to them."
2021-07-21 17:15:05,"Allow me, if you will, to state a hypothesis with a particular given: 
COVID was produced in a lab and not in nature.

That would allow us to make the following statement:
If COVID is lab-made, then it's designed to become more malignant as well as to develop vaccine resistances over time.

Or, to put it another way: 
A human-made virus would be designed to foil medical countermeasures, no? That way we could study the worst-case outcomes and prepare for them. Or let them loose inadvertently. One or the other. Same end.

Now, my given is unproved and I get that, but let's just suppose for a moment.

Thus, the greater is the number of people who drop precautions, leading to greater proliferation and mutation of the virus -- which, after all, a lab-made virus would be inclined to do -- then the more dangerous and destructive COVID will become.

And we, in the so-called Western World are just going to roll the dice on this one and see how it falls? How very much in the Pioneer spirit. Horribly misguided; also equally Western.

Gee... I wonder which nations will come out of this in a greater power position? Sadly, it seems like Plato might have been right about Democracy after all. 

But to quote the late and esteemed Donald Rumsfield: ""But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.""

So here we go..."
2021-07-22 02:47:54,"When I read this article, all I think about is that the people that refuse to get vaccinated are the ones at risk and the government is moving on because they will never get vaccinated.  Some of these people are my friends and I still agree with the government.  They have chosen this risk.  The government no longer has an obligation to protect them.  Some of them do not believe in vax or masks.  As far as I am concerned they are on their own.  These are the same people that espouse the freedom from government of 1776 and claim the government interferes too much.  Let them face the consequences of their decisions."
2021-07-22 02:57:26,"This article ignores China, which is the largest Covid-zero country. China eliminated the virus in April 2020 and has experienced virtually no community transmission ever since. With 1.4 billion people and the second largest economy in the world, surely China should rate. Beyond that importance, I would like to know if China going to ""learn to live with Covid"" The article doesn't say. But is it really that difficult to report on what is happening in China? Perhaps the fact that China has suffered 3 deaths per million as compared to 1800 per million in the US is the reason for the author's reticence? After all, by this metric, China's leadership is hundreds of times better than America's. I hope in the future the NYT will inform us of the full picture."
2021-07-22 03:09:08,"We can learn to live with it but what we can't do is drive our medical system and personnel into the ground. Right now, they are looking at a possible fourth wave due to the delta variant and the unvaccinated.

No one is going to get proper medical treatment if the hospitals are full of covid-19 patients so re-open, slowly, with an eye pinned on admissions to the local hospitals. If I had things my way I would also start requiring vaccine passports for public venues."
2021-07-22 03:24:52,"The name of the game is to prevent the evolution of a variant that can evade existing vaccines. Delta is already able to evade the J&J vaccine, to some extent. It doesn't matter whether the variants develop in the U.S. or a third-world country--a successful variant will eventually become the dominant strain.

I sympathize with those who contract the virus because they've been lied to, but the existence of surges threatens everyone because the virus mutates every time it infects someone. With every new mutation, we risk a variant that defeats current vaccines."
2021-07-22 03:29:07,"There's a lot to be said for this policy. My son is facing high school this autumn, he is naturally anxious about it, but he was at least pleased with the idea that he would be going to a physical school and meeting his new teachers and classmates.

He is depressed at the thought that this will now not happen as he sits staring into a screen in his bedroom with a load of strangers for another year. He had to let go of his old schoolmates without seeing them for over a year, he'll probably never see them again.

We are beginning to destroy our children's lives through an over-abundance of caution. My kids are double vaxxed, their teachers are double vaxxed, their parents are double vaxxed, allow them to have their lives and childhoods back again before it's too late.

Let those who refuse to be vaccinated face the consequences of their decisions."
2021-07-22 03:43:39,"This article glosses over the fact that in places like the UK which are ""open"", there are a lot of restrictions still for travelers even if they aren't enforcing them. For example, I am in quarantine right now!  I was in quarantine on ""freedom day"" because I arrived 2 days before they stopped the restrictions (yet still have to isolate for 10 days even though someone coming 2 days later would not) . Foreigners, in particular, are STILL in covid passport purgatory where the government has declined to acknowledge the existence of American vaccine cards or European ones.  Restrictions haven't lifted on us for no reason other than our immigration status. Same in Europe. The US is still blocking european travelers. I can't travel to visit my family even now.  I wish governments were working more towards ""learning to live with it"". These days covid just looks like a back door to implementing right wing isolationism."
2021-07-22 04:54:57,"The problem finalizes in the supposition that Covid-19 has demonstrated its worse possibility and this can be tolerated in a society that is vastly suffering economically and socially from the imposition to avoid infections out of government regulation. It is almost impossible to predict what new mutations of the virus might evolve and so far the worst has been the now dominant delta variation that has even, to a small degree, overcome the resistance of fully vaccinated individuals. if the virus mutates more powerfully to not only spread more easily but also to become more powerfully deadly, then all of humanity is wide open to almost complete extinction. There is no way to be confident that this will not occur."
2021-07-22 05:01:22,"There is nothing wrong with being personally mindful, especially if one has any comorbidities. This will likely be our future. 

Rational rather than hysterical ""one size fits all"" approaches that go way too far will be needed if one wants to avoid a destructive & counterproductive backlash. 

I was reminded yesterday that on an average year over 400,000 people die of malaria and 250,000 die of flu (20-60 thousand in the US), not to mention all the other ""risks"". No-one is ever going to live in a totally ""safe"" world, unless they hide in their  basements. 

Covid was so much bigger so it inflamed many people's perceptions of danger. There will always be ""dangers"" and only a balanced approach can counter them."

Now just have to get the vaccinations ramped up so it'll be a quite a while before we have to deal with it in the community. Hopefully!"
2021-07-22 06:32:52,I have been vacationing in Italy during the past week and have been very impressed with how Italians are totally compliant with the wearing of masks indoors.

We accepted that 2020 was a year of shut borders and we suffered through a grinding lockdown here in Melbourne in order to protect ourselves and the rest of the country. That was our side of the deal--our federal government was to figure out in-bound quarantine and develop an effective vaccine rollout in return.
Here we are, 18 months after this all began, and most of us are still waiting to even become part of the vaccination queue. Family and friends are stuck overseas, people's careers and lives are in limbo, we repeatedly return to lockdown, and our federal government can barely even bring itself to accept responsibility, much less try to do something about the situation."

Coronavirus is far from finished wreaking havoc."
2021-07-22 09:55:17,"From everything I've read & heard recently, the majority of Australians, except many in Sydney & Melbourne, want restrictions to remain until a greater majority of people are vaccinated.  Only then can we learn to live with it.
It will become the common flu eventually but remember the flu kills thousands every winter.
My daughter in a capitol city has endured many lockdowns & still must sanitise & wear a mask all day every day at her job.  She has no complaints & kept away from us for a full year because of out-breaks; we appreciated that.
I'm fortunate to live in a small town on sunny Qld's east coast, that was only affected 8 months ago, when a few people who returned from an infected cruise ship didn't quarantine as told.  
Since then distancing has become a way of life & when our townsfolk go the larger towns 30 & 37 miles away, they enact all precautions.  Common sense usually prevails.
People are getting vaccinated when they can & lucky for us our only pharmacist is also doing jabs.
We are back to checking in everywhere with phones or signing in, plus wearing masks in crowded places though it's optional in some areas.  We have home delivery for many services.  Every store & public place has hand sanitiser at the front for all to use.
I have a son & family on the south-west coast & sadly it may be years before we physically see one another again - they are  2800 miles away.  They too have been able to live a fairly normal life with precautions."

Harsh lockdowns may be tough.  But with planning and god management, that can be bearable.  Nonetheless, short term suffer beats long term illness.

We need to learn from this mistake.
2021-07-22 13:47:01,"It continues to be really really frustrating that certainly the news media, and maybe a lot of medical people as well, that they do not understand evolution or it’s process. A virus is a living organism, though it borrows certain functions from its host. Living organisms do not want to go extinct and through genetic mutation they adapt to a changing environment. You know, “survival of the fittest” only for viruses “fittest” means virulence. Galapagos tortoises, the poster child of evolution, have generation times in which they can “test” fitness is decades long. For viruses it’s a few days or as long as an infected person can encounter someone else to infect thus to “test” it’s mutation. As long as there are a significantly high pool of unvaccinated people, COVID will continue to find the fittest genetic code. It’s Evolution, Evolution, Evolution! What don’t you people get it?"

2021-07-21 14:46:43,"What if, what if, what if... the mantra of public health authorities. It's easy, because ""if it doesn't happen"", no harm, ""if it does happen"" they can say ""I told you so"".  The world is weary of a disease that while more dangerous than the flu, is still a non-issue for 99.5% and diminishing portion of the population.  

There is no common disease on earth that we track by ""infections"". If you started to imagine doing so with the flu, you'd find there are an estimate 45 MILLION infections annually in the US and 30,000 deaths.  If we scrambled to impose lockdowns based on that, we might as well just shut down forever.

Once a population is significantly vaccinated and has had sufficient infections, that is the scenario.  Even at 100,000 new cases/day, that's only 36.5m cases annually (fewer than the flu), with a death rate of 0.1% presently in the UK because the vaccine is making cases less severe, that's 36,500 deaths or, to put it bluntly, the flu."

We need to build a memorial dedicated to the 600,000 Americans including my wife who were lost to Covid just as we did for 9-11, Pearl Harbor and the Pulse Nightclub.

I especially think it’s significant that we all realize that victims of COVID are not just those loved ones who died, but the the long haulers and the survivors of loved ones. I would also like to point out that there are thousands, if not millions of pandemic affected victims who were indirectly affected by the disease, especially the elderly. My own mother was on lock down in her assisted living center for more than a year. Then because she went to the emergency room because of a fall she was put on quarantine alone in a small room at her facility (they were falling protocols and doing the best they could). Because she’s elderly and had the beginnings of dementia, the isolation was scary, intolerable and traumatic. In a matter of weeks her dementia advanced leaving her unable to care for herself and more confused— when a loved one, a parent suddenly doesn’t know who you are it’s devastating, and kind of like a death. How many other elderly suffered from the pandemics necessary safety protocols that were lengthened because of playing politics with this devastating disease?"

I’m struggling to muster empathy for anyone without a valid medical excuse who qualifies for a vaccine, doesn’t get the vaccine, and then falls ill, costing us all and putting others at risk.  It’s too bad that someone didn’t run a Lincoln Project-style campaign that essentially said, “Please don’t help the virus kill your friends and neighbors.”"
2021-07-20 18:29:57,"There’s nothing wrong with what these folks are doing. But that doesn’t mean the federal government should inaugurate special mental health or survivors’ benefits for relatives of Covid victims that won’t be available to persons impacted by other medical problems. Our social welfare system already labors under far too much categorical eligibility restriction, with people in need being forced to hire social workers to navigate an endless bureaucracy and see if they qualify for some niche program.

That’s what we did with AIDS, and so we have a Ryan White Act funding AIDS hospices a homeless man dying of congestive heart failure is denied access to even though the basic goal of opening a place for a dignified end of life is the same. He whiles away his final weeks at the homeless shelter instead. Activists in the 1980s did face a battle with the Reagan Administration getting an adequate science effort from the NIH, but research into SARS CoV-2 and its outcomes is a given today.

I’m not minimizing the suffering here. But it’s a symptom of our nation’s lack of universal healthcare. Going down the yellow brick road of ever more lobbying for narrowly-defined groups, a thing our political left embraces without question now, won’t get Dorothy back to Kansas."

I wish people could understand that scientists have been working for decades on viruses and vaccines to combat them.  I worked for years at UCSF and those dedicated researchers already knew significant amount of information about COVID before this particular strain came along.  Heaven help us when the patient supposes to know more than the doctor.
2021-07-18 16:18:36,"The foundation for anti-vaccination has been in place before the pandemic.  A good reference is Kata, A.  Vaccine 2010;28:1709-16.  The portion of the Kata article that I think is key is that countering the argument with better education is ineffective, as it doesn't consider their arguments supporting vaccine rejection - e.g. vaccines = public education of the immune system; also, distrust of expertise.  The source also notes that anti-vaxers have post-modern arguments that reject scientific 'facts' in favor of personal beliefs and interpretations.  
This Times article has several exemplars whereby a public education campaign will be unsuccessful, and that even when hospitalized by the virus, or taking care of patients w severe Covid-19, some patients or even healthcare professionals will not learn.

We can't rid ourselves of these citizens, nor can they easily be persuaded to be reasonable.

And yet here we are spending billions of dollars on these same people who are sick because of their own choice. They don’t feel sorry for anyone and yet here we are, the vaccinated having to live our lives and spend our taxpayer dollars (don’t they love the “taxpayer dollars” line?) taking care of the unvaccinated. Enough already."
2021-07-18 18:02:14,Sorry. I’ve run out of sympathy for those people who refused to take a vaccine……they rolled the dice and it didn’t work out for them. They chose themselves over their community. So many people in developing countries are dying today because of Covid and would do literally anything to get a vaccine. I’ve had 2 jabs and couldn’t be happier. Everyone has a responsibility to get vaccinated if they can.
2021-07-18 19:03:29,"From articles I've read (mostly in the NYT) vaccine refusers seem to fall into two equally wrong but distinctly different groups. 

African Americans and other non-white groups who have a long and well documented history of medical malpractice foist on upon them by mainstream medicine. 

Majority white, majority rural people who have no such history with mainstream medicine. 

Though still wrong, the first group can point to a rather long list of reasons that exist OUTside their minds, independently of them, to refuse the vaccine. There appears to be little reality denial here, but rather widespread misinterpretation of accurate data. 

The second group can point to no such list, is not working with accurate data, and seems to be making decisions based on emotions. 

The first group refuses due to external reasons. The second, due to internal. 

It would seem to me these two groups require different approaches. 

I suggest there'd be more bang for the buck with efforts to convince the first group as their refusal is more reality oriented and uses actual data to reach their conclusions.

Just some random thoughts."
2021-07-18 19:17:34,"These people are beyond ignorant. 
As an ICU Nurse, I’ve seen a disproportionate amount of suffering and death. 
This a public health emergency, not a political one. Our seriously ill patients have one common denominator;None of them were vaccinated. I implore you to get vaccinated.  
I had Covid in June 2020, and I got the
vaccine in December 2021. I also had my young teenage son vaccinated. I agree with France’s recent mandate for healthcare workers to be vaccinated, as well as the Houston, TX Hospital that fired several nurses for refusing Covid Vaccination.  Doctors and Nurse should act as proper role models."
2021-07-18 17:23:47,"Arkansas is rated 47 of the 50 states for quality of education so the low level of vaccination acceptance may not be too surprising.  Of the 5 states rated the lowest in education (AL,MS,AK,LA,WV) only WV is not also among the 5 least vaccinated states #43), and of the 10 least educated states only NM is in the top half of most vaccinated states (#10)! There certainly seems to be a relationship between education (either quality or length) with the ability to recognized unsupported concerns (? conspiracy theories) and understand the importance of vaccination.  What is even more concerning is that only 40% of healthcare workers in AK are vaccinated! This lack of education feeds into lack of trust in science and medicine in general and has likely contributed to the AK Legislature passing a law requiring a 2 yr buffer from vaccine  full approval to allowing any sort of mandate to receive the vaccine.  They certainly do not understand, or refuse to understand, that full, unrestricted unqualified, approval of a vaccine (or any medication) build in a several year period to allow for identification of late effects of the vaccine/drug.  One would hope that the legislators would have been told this by their state medical officials.  However, if doctors, nurses and allied health professionals who care for Covid patients won't accept vaccines, how can we expect legislators and the general public to listen?"
2021-07-18 18:33:56,"“Even health care workers have balked. Statewide, only about 40 percent are vaccinated, Dr. Romero said.

In April, the state legislature added yet another roadblock, making it essentially illegal for any state or local entity, including public hospitals, to require coronavirus vaccination as a condition of education or employment until two years after the Food and Drug Administration fully licenses a shot. That almost certainly means no such requirements can be issued until late in 2023.”

Even though I know better than to be still be stunned by anti-vaccination ignorance, my mouth still dropped open reading this article. A miasma of misinformation and obstinacy clouding Arkansas, and the country."
2021-07-18 18:36:25,"It sounds inhumane, but there should be some consequences for people who don't get vaccinated. Their bad decisions are creating extraordinary increased cost for the rest of us.

And, no, this isn't like drinking, or overeating. In those cases we are talking about lifestyle changes and/or addiction. Getting vaccinated is free, easy, and low-risk.

Just letting people make up their own minds about things they don't understand isn't working."

Only about 40% of residents are fully vaccinated, yet in stores almost no one is wearing a mask except a few older people like me.  As of this week, even though I am vaccinated, I am back to double-masking, a cloth mask over a surgical mask, partly for my own safety and partly to protect others and to reassure them if I happen to cough.  

After hundreds of millions of people receiving vaccinations, there is no reason to wait to see how well people do with the vaccine.  But there are urgent reasons to get one's shots.

Nor is being Republican an excuse for not being vaccinated.  This is not an issue of personal rights and freedom.  The virus does not care what your politics are.  It just looks for a new home to replicate and grow stronger."
2021-07-18 16:19:01,"One problem is that people have no idea of relative risk. The risk of complications from the vaccine is many orders of magnitude lower than the risk of contracting COVID and ending up with serious symptoms. The risk to die from the vaccine is practically nil, while for COVID is very real and at least 1000x higher.  Math and science illiteracy can kill."

It feels like people are going back to the dark ages. Do they believe in witches too?
2021-07-18 18:57:18,"Ms Billigmeier is very uninformed about how many people get vaccines before they are given to the population. The polio vaccine was given to 1.8 million CHILDREN, and then given to children, including me (and I suspect her). Now we have a vaccine given to 180  million people and it is too new? And we haven’t had the problems polio had with the bad batch of vaccine. I believe the media needs to be clearer about the safety of these vaccines and use experts to discuss why they are safe with comparisons to other vaccines. Ultimately, an expeditious full approval with people being required to have a vaccine to do the things we all want to do, will provide the incentive to get past the unfortunate decision by national and state leadership to make this a political issue instead of a public health issue."

This COVID-19 virus means business, and the most recent delta variant is like the original version on steroids.

How many more people will have to die, or get deathly ill and then become COVID long haulers for the rest of their lives before the refuseniks wake up?

I have to wonder at this point if some extreme measure might be called for, and might even help.

What if former President Bubba, who is also the former Governor of Arkansas, made a personal appearance and a personal appeal? We know that the Clintons got both of their jabs. Do Arkansans still have any residual respect for Bill Clinton's views on life's issues? And what about Hillary Rodham, the former first lady of Arkansas? Could her appeal get through to people?

Politics has never been so irrelevant to the nation's well being. Vote how you like. Think what you like. If we as a nation don't prevent the novel coronavirus from further mutating into more dangerous variants (which we can only do by removing available human hosts for it to grow in), we're sunk.

However, this too can be incorporated into the narcissistic belief that it is god's will or that death is warranted and part of a greater good directed by a fairy godmother.

So without consequences to these populations, nothing will change.
With consequences, maybe?  As long as the Federal Government acts as a super insurance company against stupidity, we will all be affected by the ignorant.  A first step would be to require the unvaccinated to pay their medical bills."

And the ""pro-life"" crowd's mantra that ""EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS"" apparently doesn't apply to the grocery store workers and health care professionals whose lives they put at risk every day by vehemently refusing to wear masks and get vaccinated.   Good Christians all.

And that's the same Arkansas legislature that a few months ago passed a law that essentially bans abortion because, apparently, that same Constitution that people wave around claiming it forbids the gov-ment from mandating masks outside a person's body does not forbid the gov-ment from deciding what women are allowed to do with the insides of their bodies."
2021-07-18 20:18:14,"I find it hard to contain my fury at the politicians, pundits, preachers, prevaricators and outright liars who have put their beliefs and desires for profit and power ahead of the science, scientists, and doctors who have tried to do nothing more than help the people of this nation and the world.  Because of them we may yet get COVID-21 because some mutation of the virus renders the current vaccines ineffective, and the pandemic will start all over again.

A couple of other points related to the US in particular:

• This whole anti-vaccination thing is *ONE* example of the failure of education in this country.  People can't recognize pseudo-science on the Internet.  People lack critical thinking and vote for politicians who tell them what they want to hear even when said politicians are OBVIOUSLY LYING.  People put religious beliefs in front of proven fact.  Etc.  It's too late for the truth to reach the WILLFULLY IGNORANT and change their minds and do the right thing.

• This article fails to mention the influence AND CULPABILITY of Donald Trump even once.  If Trump had taken serious steps to fight the pandemic RIGHT AWAY, If he had worn a mask from the beginning, if he had rolled up his sleeve and been first in line to get a vaccination,  if he had told his supporters that science trumps belief, then we would not have 600,000+ Americans dead, and there would be FAR less chance of a future variant not stopped by the current vaccines."
2021-07-18 20:24:25,"So, the ""reasonable"" echo among the willfully misled and their misleaders is that the vaccines are ""too new?""

But they have allowed their spite and resentment toward ""libs"" to become so malignant, they'd rather die than get vaccinated."
2021-07-18 20:44:49,"Two main reasons people say for hesitancy: too new or too risky. 

Too new?  Did you get a flu shot? Every year, there’s a NEW vaccine for the flu that many people get. Plus, the Covid technology has been tested for the past 20  years. 

Too risky? By now, millions and millions are proving its worth and low, low rate of problems.  (I only had a sore arm after my second shot). There’s much higher risk you’ll get Covid if you don’t get vaccinated.

Those that are actually in the know about risk of vaccine versus risk of unvaccinated severe COVID, but choose to instead to play up only the limited risk events (looking at you Fox News who on my news feed is sure to report every vaccine complication they come across) should be ashamed of themselves. It is the ultimate crime to blatantly put financial and political self-interest above public good that there is, especially when you know the actual truth.

I mean really how can your head not explode when you hear these people saying about friends and family who rejected getting a shot and are now dead that they weren’t stupid just stubborn.

I did it for people here and for people in Alabama and in London and in Sri Lanka, for rich and poor, for all races and all political stripes. I did it to help us all.

I am revolted by the anti-vax gang that will likely throw us all back into another horrible winter of isolation. Buffoons. These whiners will wind up costing people their businesses, impeding social gatherings, harming mental health, and killing people who come in contact.

Mostly its just flu-like symptoms, but some of my friends have been floored by the vaccine for days and for one even weeks. As a naturally immune person (its been over a year and Ive never gotten it since, and Ive been traveling the nation pretty much constantly) I dont want to take a vaccine that will not help me much and could have negative side effects. Myocarditis, GBS, blood clots, flu, and who knows what else. Im 33, in perfect health, and naturally immune. My risk analysis says that this vaccine will do nothing positive and has a small chance of being very negative. It doesnt make sense for me to take it. Im an MIT-educated biologist. Im very familiar with virology, Ive even worked for man who won a nobel prize for virus research. I look at data, and data says that I dont need a vaccine. Im tired of people believing that there is no valid reason why anyone shouldnt get the vaccine.

It was open 7 to 7, 7 days a week, fully staffed. We were SWAMPED as soon as Tier 1A was finished, and appointments were opened up to the general public. Then, as everyone who was desperate to get vaccinated got their jab, traffic slowed. We had a second crush when 12 years and older were approved, and a much smaller, and angrier surge when many health care facilities/corporations mandated vaccination to remain employed.  The amount of people coming in faded to the point that even though we had the second highest number of vaccinations administered, we couldn’t justify the cost to stay open. We closed June 30th, with only 50% of the county fully vaccinated. 
The entire thing was FREE. No one asked for your insurance, immigrant status, medical records, NOTHING. You registered, answered some screening questions (to make sure you weren’t infected already), and got your shot/card, and left. 
Anyone in my area, Lancaster PA, had MONTHS of opportunity to get vaccinated. It’s on them now. 
In my opinion, health insurance should refuse to cover CV19 costs, if you refused vaccination. Pay for your own foolishness, because, trust me, WE too, will pay, in more preventable deaths, more mutations, more economic decay.

I think that just because people can't see the virus, they underestimate it's lethality.  

I never had any side effects from both Moderna shots.  Not even a sore arm.  

The bottom line:  People need to get passed all the ridiculous things that they read on the internet and just follow medical advice and get their shots.   

These current rules that people with their shots can go without a mask invites people who are un-vaccinated or who don't believe in preventive health measures to cheat.

The people offer the dying person as much of the water as he wants.  He refuses because it could have been poisoned (even though the people drinking it are perfectly fine, the poison might be slow acting).  He spins these odd hypotheticals to justify why he won’t take this obvious solution to his immediate and lethal problem. They see he’s near death and plead with him to take the water.

The virus is the video game hero that picks up new strengths, vanquishes the weakest defenses and moves to the next level.  The original virus was not stopped by imposing travel bans and moved to the next level, the entire world.  The next challenge was face masks.  Masks fooled the virus into thinking the next victim was too far away for it to survive.  Many outside Asia did not mask, so the hero survived outside of Asia. it won in the west and moved to the next level.  The virus was so prevalent, it easily picked up a “more transmissible” prize and became the alpha mutant.  That mutant virus was so prevalent, it picked up another “more transmissible” prize and became the delta variant, which with its new strengths could reattack masked Asia.  The vaccines kill the original virus but the delta mutant is so strong, it overpowers vaccinated people, gets them sick, and now can transmit through vaccinated people.  The mutant virus has moved to the next level where it will spawn the omega variant, the one that will hospitalize and kill vaccinated people.  Game over for civilization.
Some relatives and friends are unvaccinated and I love you individually but collectively, unvaccinated people will shelter the virus and thrown us back to hunting and gatherering.  Half-vaccinated regions are the places where the mutant will pick up the omega prize, so all of humanity must vaccinate, sooner the better."

If economic factors alone could be relied on to dictate the correct result, one would have expected insurance companies to announce that they would no longer cover any medical expenses connected to Covid for the unvaccinated. That might jog the unfeeling into action. But that hasn't happened. So, government should do its duty and require vaccination. You don't get to choose whether you register for the draft; you don't get to choose whether your children will get vaccinated for school. You shouldn't get to choose whether or to not be vaccinated either. For what you are choosing is to be indifferent to others, and that's not the way a society works"

Pandemics rarely end in 2 years historically, the painful reality is that this pandemic could last four or five."

Which is what we're seeing--hospitalizations ramping up, 95% of them unvaccinated, but a very small increase in the death rate. Because the over-65 at risk population is now 90% vaccinated. I'm in that group, had my two Pfizer shots early on, and now want the feds to hurry up and approve a booster. I've read enough to be convinced it will bump my antibodies up by 5-10 times just at the six month point when short term antibodies start to decrease. If I have to be an outlaw--a militant vaxxer--and get out ahead of the slow moving process for boosters, I will. 
Public health officials may be right on masks for the vaccinated to interrupt transmission, but even the responsible vaccinated crowd is growing weary of the Covid battle after 18 months."

As a vaccinated person, my chief concern has always been not getting hospitalized or dying.  For unvaccinated people, they have been living with this risk throughout.

I understand that the delta variant is much more transmissible, but from an overall risk standpoint, I am having trouble understanding what has materially shifted.  Obviously, there is a public health risk of hospitals being swarmed, and there are immunocompromised people and children that I worry about.

But today versus a months ago, the story seems to still be that if you’re vaccinated, your risk with this virus is remarkably low; if you aren’t vaccinated, you have made your own decision to not do so; and I haven’t seen any reporting of evidence that children are materially at greater risk."
2021-07-30 10:35:44,"My kids went back to school this week with universal masking and screening tests before the first day. Today is Day 4 of school and hundreds of kids and over a dozen teachers are quarantined after 6 positive cases and counting. 

This is not a drill. Hundreds of thousands of additional Georgia students start school next week, many in mask-optional districts. This is about to complete explode. Parents, take it from this parent who received a quarantine notification after Day 2: talk to your schools NOW about quarantine procedures and get ready. It's not if but when."
2021-07-30 10:36:01,"At this point, is the opponent in this fight COVID , or is it those who refuse vaccination?"
2021-07-30 10:41:27,"To start with, I’ve been vaccinated since getting my 2nd shot on March 12th as are everyone in my family including siblings and their families. I believe everyone who is medically able should get the vaccine. I do ask where is the press conference (daily) to discuss this topic in greater detail and answer questions about what is happening?  Why does it take newspapers getting some internal documents that refer to some studies to get the information on this Delta variant out to people. The head of the CDC releasing a voice only recording to explain what is happening and then attempting to correct that by going on one news show is ridiculous and very confusing. The information release and transparency on this by the government is not adequate when the result is that millions of Americans, vaccinated or not, are left in a state of confusion. Get your act together and do a better job of keeping the people better informed. News media should be leading the charge in demanding better transparency of the government than what we are getting but it seems they are not. I just see alternating stories with varying degrees of concern by not vetted “medical professionals” that further confuse the situation because they could all be right, could all be wrong or a total mix of right and wrong. This variant is a concern but I’d like to know better just how concerned we should all be and why. The “why” is the most important question needing answers right now."
2021-07-30 10:45:10,"I have tried to convince two of my key employees to vaccinate - no luck. Since they are good people and valued colleagues (not to mention that it is nearly impossible to bring on talented help right now) we are working around their beliefs and will not allow them in the office when we reopen in September. They will remain in their jobs though. 

Every day I read something that makes it clear that vaccination is imperative for society as well as themselves. 

But every day I also read something that confirms that part of the GOP is trying to destroy democracy, and those folks who follow that path act like they too are doing nothing wrong."
2021-07-30 10:45:22,"There is no science in the CDC's latest political based messaging.  

The hospitals are not overwhelmed and COVID deaths are a fraction of what they were last year.

2021-07-30 10:45:24,"And if we cannot stop it spreading at the rate it is currently spreading, what will the next variant be like? Will it be a magnitude worse? Or a thousand times worse?

And what are many of your political leaders, (and mine), doing? 

Well, let it rip through our communities and schools. And let it rip through the House of Representatives, if we are to take Minority Leader McCarthy’s recent verbal attack on the House physician’s advice to mask up.

I simply despair at the stupidity of them all. This is a common sense public health issue.

And in years to come, when it is hopefully, finally over, maybe Kevin will ask himself, “was it really the right descison, just to keep in with “the base” and keep my job?”"

About how Americans are all in this together, and will fight even if they are afraid, for our country and our people.  And that those who do what they have to, even if they are afraid, are truly American.  Those who are not vaccinated are allowing the enemy to win and abandoning all of us who took the vaccine, even though there may be some perceived risks.  The risk really is not nearly as great as the soldiers who died for us.  And yet, folks have become so selfish, so UnAmerican, that they are letting this evil virus, that has no fear, win."

Except now, we have all the tools to prevent hospitalizations and deaths for a vast majority of people (masks and an effective vaccine). If Republicans don’t want to take it because “I’ve weighed the risks and it’s my choice” then it’s my choice to move on with my life after I’ve done my best to think of others for the last year   of the pandemic."

2021-07-30 10:56:42,"If this is contagious as chicken pox it has spread much faster over the past month and will burn out much sooner n the coming weeks - it also means it is clearly not more deadly based on the numbers.  Then again, the CDC is basing this off reports from other countries along with anecdotal information as it continues it's knee-jerk and science-free decision making process.  Go ahead, ask the CDC what worth a cloth mask is for a virus that spreads like chickenpox - it's virtually useless.  I guess everyone is supposed to get N-95 masks now?"

Everyone, vaccinated or not, was much to ready to declare victory and go back to business as usual, and yes, I do mean business.  For whatever reason, this virus seems marvelously attuned to adaptation. If we're going to rely on a vaccine, it should be one that addresses multiple chokepoints, so that even a wily virus can't defeat them all, and that will require cooperation among groups not used to such an arrangement. Drug companies, adversarial governments, and academics must be brought together under one umbrella. Good luck."
2021-07-30 10:57:37,"Key takeaway:  ""Still, the C.D.C.’s figures show that the vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death in vaccinated people, experts said.""

C.D.C. head Rochelle Walensky has been repeatedly exposed as an ignorant, immature and incompetent partisan political hack in her mishandling of the  COVID -19 masks and social distancing mandates.

Rochelle Walensky 's premature declaration of COVID-19 pandemic mission accomplished victory when only 52% of Americans haven't been fully vaccinated and 45% of Americans haven't received a single vaccination shot was disastrous..

Moreover.  COVID-19 is furiously mutating in order to be more RNA genomic evolutionary fit be fruitful and multiply to evade the human immune system, vaccines and therapeutics.

In light of this, I would urge the CDC to start allowing people 60 and older to get a third Pfizer shot to increase antibodies and t-cell resistance, which Israel is already doing.

The point is “new data suggest that vaccinated people are spreading the virus and contributing to [the increase in cases.]”  The point is, vaccination will likely protect you from death or hospitalization, but it won’t necessarily prevent you from catching the virus and spreading it to someone who won’t be so lucky. The point is, even if you’re vaccinated you need to wear a mask indoors or you’re just as culpable as the unvaccinated folks everyone is blaming in these comments. Wear a mask.

If I can be drafted to fight a military war against humans (unless medically exempted), then I can and should be “drafted” to fight a war against a microscopic enemy by getting vaccinated (again, unless medically exempted).

Vaccination carries far, far, far, far less risk than being a front-line soldier in an active war.

By the way, this enemy (COVID19 virus) has killed more Americans in 16-17 months than our enemies in WW II over nearly 4 years of fighting that war."
2021-07-30 11:26:52,"I have read the initial report on this story on the WaPo. This latest information from the CDC is alarming but not surprising. I have been vaccinated myself and can see the benefits of vaccination.
 The WaPo  additionally states the following,
'One of the slides states that there is a higher risk among older age groups for hospitalization and death relative to younger people, regardless of vaccination status. Another estimates that there are 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans.
'Walter A. Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, said he was struck by data showing that vaccinated people who became infected with delta shed just as much virus as those who were not vaccinated. The slide references an outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., where vaccinated and unvaccinated people shed nearly identical amounts of virus.’
A person working in partnership with the CDC, ‘said the data came from a July 4 outbreak in Provincetown, Mass. Genetic analysis of the outbreak showed that people who were vaccinated were transmitting the virus to other vaccinated people. The person said the data was “deeply disconcerting” and a “canary in the coal mine” for scientists who had seen the data.’
‘I think the central issue is that vaccinated people are probably involved to a substantial extent in the transmission of delta,’ Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist wrote in an email after reviewing the CDC slides.’"

2021-07-30 11:31:32,No kidding.  Even the limited vaccination rates had stopped the original covid and UK variants cold in their tracks by July 4th.  The Delta variant is so much more transmissible that it is blowing up with up-swings that are matching the ones of last fall and winter.  Follow Israel's lead the start giving boosters to the elderly and sick now.  There are tens of millions of doses just sitting in ultra-freezers around the country.

Vaccination is a way to hold the line while we develop means through drugs and public health measures to eradicate it completely.  This is a challenge on such a scale that nothing in history can compare.  We are in need of a leadership that will articulate this fact.

Our Governor DeSantis has made several responses to COVID, all of them wrong. His worst is his most recent. He has forbidden even SCHOOLS and PRIVATE INDUSTRY from requiring proof of vaccination. Vaccinations were supposed to put an end to COVID deaths. Even with this latest data it is clear that they would very nearly have ended COVID deaths though perhaps not the disease. However the vaccinations are being undermined by people who say they are not yet ready to be vaccinated. What are they waiting for, a rainy day? What is DeSantis waiting for, a tropical storm? We now have a COVID hurricane."

If the Delta variant is really, ""...the troubling variant we already knew it was"" then why was there guidance by the CDC that continued use of masks by the unvaccinated was not necessary? Why are there no calls by the CDC for mandatory vaccination? 

The expectation of the CDC is that they operate out of an over abundance of caution (a.k.a. do no harm) and not as another arm of the Commerce Department. The CDC is about 4-5 months behind where they should be and their credibility continues its downward spiral."

...""the new data suggest that vaccinated people are spreading the virus... probably to a far lesser degree than unvaccinated.""
As to severe illness ""Infection with the Delta variant may be more likely to lead to severe illness."" and then ""Still, the CDC figures show... the vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death...""
Since the pandemic began the media has contributed mightily to  confusion about the virus and effectiveness of vaccine by not providing context and consistency, and focusing on the fearful aspects of the virus and not the encouraging news about effectiveness of vaccines  and mask wearing. Research shows that people are motivated to get vaccinated through positive reinforcement more than fear.
This virus may be with us a long time and we need to learn to live around it. The repercussions of economic and social dislocation brought by the lockdowns and social policy will be with us for a generation.  The unvaccinated have a choice to make and should accept the risk. The rest of us should resume our lives."
2021-07-30 11:51:07,"This is the study I have been waiting for.  I have been following the Delta variant since it was identified in India in April.  It was clear it was bad news, but they did not have the genetic testing to say how it compared to the other variants.

Then it moved to Britain, with much better testing capabilities.  But they do not have the same vaccines that we do, and have different social habits and lockdown rules also.  So this is the one relevant to us.  We will learn a lot more before it is all over.

Information benefits those who use it.  There is an entire political group in this country that is allergic to it."
2021-07-30 11:54:50,"The refusal of some Americans, and some elected officials, to wear masks or get vaccinated tells us something about the willingness and psychological ability of people to pay relatively minor present day costs in order to prevent possible future disasters that are less than certain and abstract.   Kind of like the marshmellow test with young children.  Or what has happened with fossil fuels and climate change and the resulting floods, wildfires, and hot summer."
2021-07-30 11:54:55,"I have an idea for simple data collection...if anyone (CDC?) will hear me...

For the existing daily data of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, add a breakout of vaccinated vs unvaccinated, along with rates per 100k.

If that exists somewhere please tell me. I certainly do not see that in the NYT data.

If that data do not exist anywhere then we should be able to find a little bit of funding in the 1.9 trillion that was approved earlier this year to collect it.

This data would be very useful in evaluating relative risk in being vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. I believe/hope that it would clearly indicate that vaccines work, but with the number of breakthrough cases happening I can't help but think that the vaccines aren't working as well as we are being led to believe."
2021-07-30 11:59:04,"The CDC director hasn’t done the right thing since she changed mask guidance back in May which in large part led to virus uptick. I don’t trust she will be honest and do the right thing now. Making matters worse are these large festivals and music events, especially the one DeBlasio plans to have. Governors have lost their executive powers and local politicians are afraid to be bold. Get vaccinated and get those masks back on. Who cares if you were told you didn’t have to. Responsibility lies with everyone of us."
2021-07-30 11:59:37,"Chickenpox is highly contagious, but since a vaccine was developed in the mid 1980s I haven't heard of anyone having it. I remember it from the 1950s and '60s when I and my siblings came had it. My daughters came down with it right before the vaccine was included in the roster of childhood vaccinations. Perhaps younger people have no knowledge or appreciation of how contagious it is. Maybe this is part of the the anti-vaxx movement. They cannot appreciate the importance and protection of vaccines because they have benefited too well from them and only look at the rare potential side effects. I still bear the scar of my smallpox vaccination and, having studied history, am grateful for it. Wise up, folks."
2021-07-30 11:59:41,"The selfish attitude of many of the unvaccinated hinges on the assumption that once there are enough vaccinated people, the unvaccinated will be protected without having to be vaccinated themselves. Well, this is no longer guaranteed, as vaccinated people can spread the virus while they are mostly proteced themselves from serious illness or hospitalization. Now will be a great time for a change of heart.

So what if you swore in front of your friends to never take the vaccine. It's your ego or your life..."

What could this possibly mean?"
2021-07-30 12:05:21,"“Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential,” the document said.”

Universal masking … not just masking in areas with low vaccination rates and/or high transmissibility.  

So, why isn’t that the new guidance especially since the finally acknowledged out loud fear is that there will be a variant that completely breaks through the vaccines?

I really can’t write more at the moment because I am so scared I feel like I can barely breathe."
2021-07-30 12:11:05,"The CDC bears a great deal of responsibility for this because they removed masking and other safety measures too soon, and gave fools free rein to go back to life as normal, at the same time that not enough people were vaccinated. It was obvious to anyone with a brain that personal responsibility and mature behavior were not traits that a great many citizens possessed. And even today, at this very moment, there is no mandate, only strong recommendations, protecting vulnerable children, and that is horrible, because schools will reopen in a few weeks. If July 4th gatherings spread the virus, just think of what is going to happen when unvaccinated children return to class with voluntary compliance to these recommendations. trump bears responsibility for much of this, but now the CDC can proudly claim their share of the burden."
2021-07-30 12:11:44,"Give the CDC a break folks.  The virus, like all viruses, bounces around the population and mutates.  The Delta variant is a whole new ballgame, and CDC is responding with guidance addressing the Delta variant that may be different than its guidance with respect to earlier variants.

I took them because there was a lot of proven evidence they worked not like the countless useless pills, procedures, operations that the industry foists upon us.

It is insane that they are not talking about the difference. Even if asymptomatic people have the same viral load, you’d still expect less spread because of less removal of virus from sources such as coughing.
I would also appreciate if CDC talks about why places like the UK and Missouri are seeing declines in Delta even though they’re fully open."

I wish they'd just cancel in person classes for the fall semester now instead of having everyone move in and then (it seems very possible) have everyone move out in a month causing an increase in transmission from everyone traveling. Great! they require students to get vaccinated but we now have ebidence that the vaccines are not enough. So why are we still going about as if life is normal when we had a completely different response when the vaccine was still spreading last year? Schools (pre-k - 12 as well) MUST come up with a strategy NOW and they need the guidance of the CDC. Have we learned absolutely nothing? Would Americans much rather ignore the hard lessons we've learned in the past year and a half and wander blindly into the storm? I don't know about you, but that seems like what sheep would actually do. I am furious that everyone is moving forward as if nothing is happening. I would much rather sit at home on zoom than have my schooling interrupted AGAIN. However, it seems that many people and leaders in this country want what they want and they want it now and have absolutely no self control or discipline and are incapable of reflecting on the tumultuous and terrifying experience the entire world has been through and is STILL going through. I am disgusted."

The problem is the malicious liars, charlatans, and crooks who are shamelessly profiteering from spreading misinformation and anti-vax drivel. Think Tucker Carlson, the Trump Crime Family, and hundreds of lesser scam artists doing this. Until we hold these people accountable, a forced vaccination program will just validate the worst fears of many of the people buying into the false narrative of these despicable fraudsters. I'd personally like to see a legal group that can sue these scam artists out of existence and into jail for frauds that are literally getting people killed."

2021-07-30 12:32:06,"The Delta Variant originated in India in December 2020.

The Delta Variant has been in the US since at least March 2021.  

The Delta Variant is more contagious than the original strain. 

The CDC labeled Delta as a “variant of concern” in June 2021.

The US CFR has now dropped to its lowest point since March 2020, and has continued to drop despite the 4-5 months of lead time for the Delta Variant. 

Two doses of any major US vaccine have proven to minimize the symptoms and hospitalization rates of Delta.

The unvaccinated are at risk of much more serious symptoms and hospitalizations. 

Full vaccinations of the unvaccinated will protect those recipients from serious disease and will minimize the symptoms and hospitalizations of the new recipients.  

Our experts say the vaccinated typically have symptoms similar to a cold. 

If 600,000 dead does not “scare” the unvaccinated into being vaccinated, more fear-mongering and misinformation about Delta will not either.  

Give people the facts and let them decided.  

If that is unsatisfactory the only other effective approach is to have the government mandate the vaccines.  Which, with almost 100,000,000 unvaccinated US adults, would be fraught with major social, religious and racial issues."

Not to be an alarmist, but if I recall correctly, some individuals easily became infected from merely handling the clothing and other personal effects of ill family members.

Since the Delta variant is said to be more easily transmissible than the Ebola virus, and though rare, even some vaccinated people have breakthrough infections and become spreaders, what additional protective measures beyond those recommended for the Alpha variant, does the CDC suggest that people take?"

If we use the House Republicans as role models, if we believe that the governments of Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, et. al., are taking the proper approach, and if we agree that vaccination isn’t needed, then we will have succeeded in regressing our nation back to the 1920s, the good old days of polio, tuberculosis, no antibiotics, measles, mumps, chickenpox, whooping cough, prohibition, gangsterism, and last but not least, the Great Depression of 1929. In those days there were few cars, no television, no computers, more menial jobs, and a tremendous disparity between haves and have nots. There was also rampant bigotry and segregation, with the KKK in its prime. People lived in tenements without heat, air conditioning, and only ice boxes instead of refrigerators. What we consider the basics of life had not even been thought of then. People died much younger, and their daily lives were far less satisfying than ours are today. So if you want to go back to that, then by all means feel free. If you believe, though, that our current way of life is more like it, then join the 21st century, get vaccinated, follow CDC guidelines, and don’t let the Kevin McCarthys of the world cut your lives short for no other reason than that they care only about themselves."

He had no choice but to drop our mask mandate once the CDC came out with its crazy mask guidance that gave anti-vaxxers full cover to continue lying and also spread disease.

Those of us who aren’t insane and/or stupid have continued to wear masks in stores etc. But the chances of getting a mask mandate to work again are low. 

All I can hope is that the FDA fully approves the vaccines as quickly as possible to convert the “EUA” hesitant and that more private businesses will require employees to be vaccinated. And that those who are now convinced that it’s the vaccinated who are most responsible for spreading the virus will learn to read all the way through the article.

The bad news is that they don’t prevent infection and transmissibility, if infected.

I am of course quarantining, but I am not worried about my own health in the least, because I am vaccinated. With much of the American population unwilling to get vaccinated and the vaccine unavailable in many other parts of the world, eliminating the always mutating virus entirely will be impossible. If I haven't gotten Delta now, I will likely get it or some newer version of COVID in the future. My plan is to get the latest vaccines when they become available, quarantine when I know I've been exposed, mask in public places, and use extreme caution when dealing with the immunocompromised. Otherwise, I intend to live my life as normal. The future will be filled with many more bleak threats: we must be responsible, but we don't have to live our lives in fear. Death comes for us all eventually."
2021-07-30 13:08:29,"Within the last two weeks, four friends who were completely vaccinated got COVID. Because they were protected, none has been hospitalized. Things have changed and it’s quite obvious. So wear a mask if you weren’t and get vaccinated. I don’t care who you voted for."
2021-07-30 13:09:53,"I don't understand why Americans (and the American Government) can't behave like grown ups instead of all the whining and placating. 
The facts are simple. Covid is highly contagious and vaccines protect against serious illness but protect less well against infection of the nose and throat. Infection in the nose and throat may be highly transmitted even if the person has been vaccinated and/or is asymptomatic. 
Masks offer significant prevention of spread from an infected person to others. They offer some protection to the wearer from getting infected, but the real reason for wearing a mask is a public health issue to prevent spread.
Therefore, all Americans, as a public health measure, should wear masks, particularly indoors or in crowds, until enough people are vaccinated to significantly decrease spread. Social distancing is appropriate where possible. 
If people did this without all the complaining and got on with their lives, we probably would be out of this epidemic in a reasonable time.
I do not subscribe to the belief that the wearing of a mask is an individual right. It is a public health measure not  an individual choice. We do not allow people to drive 60 mile per hour in school zones, why should we allow people to not wear masks."

I understand why there is so much doubt and confusion - there has never been a consistent message.  One of their biggest errors in judgment was to announce that vaccinated folks didn't need to wear a face mask.  Good grief, only half of the country is fully vaccinated.  What are they thinking?

It has been 6 months since vaccination of the most vulnerable people, those over 65, were allowed by the CDC to begin receiving vaccination.  Before 6 months ago, older people were denied vaccination in order to vaccinate 25 million privileged people, nearly all of whom were aged 21 - 60 (doctors, politicians, teachers, cops, nurses and employees of medical facilities the majority of whom were not doctors or nurses and did not care for Covid patients).

We've had time to develop vaccines faster than we thought possible and gathered all sorts of data on indoor / outdoor transmission, crowd sizes, ventilation, fomites, etc.

As individuals made new behaviors into habits, developed resiliency strategies, know how to plan for lock downs, and have finally had a chance to buy some good masks to get us through 2.0.

But we're still on the starter pandemic. Anyone who wants to die of old age or one of the ""old-fashioned"" hard-to-prevent illnesses would do well to prepare for and be vigilant about the Next One. No one gets to object that stockpiling medical supplies and equipment and supporting local manufacturing of same is ""too expensive"" or will contribute ""too much"" to the federal deficit."
2021-07-30 13:24:54,"While I applaud the intention of the in CDC staying on top of this Delta variant, the information coming out the CDC this week is all over the map (no pun intended). 

Before this article and the newly disclosed CDC report it was widely reported that the Delta variant exists in the nose and throat at 1000x the Alpha variant. In the new CDC internal report, however, its now 10x - but it exists in the body of an infected person at 1000x.   

The problem is that nothing has been reported regarding whether the 10x 1000x multipliers apply to the vaccinated or the un-vaccinated.  If they apply to the vaccinated, is the vaccine working?  If yes, how?  The CDC has not yet disclosed the studies its relying on, so there's no way to tell.

The one data point that the CDC references is from an outbreak in P-town, Ma.  The numbers reported from that outbreak seem wildly out of skew with the majority of other reported studies.  An analysis by ""citizen scientists"" of a single small outbreak  doesn't seem like strong evidence to support a major public health policy shift.

Finally, is the policy intended to protect?  Young children who cant be vaccinated?  Serious covid illness in young children is exceedingly rare; the elderly and vulnerable? - they are the most vaccinated population in the country.  The very small population of the immune compromised who cant be vaccinated?  Ahh, the unvaccinated?  How far do the responsible have to go to protect their ""freedom"" to get sick?"

2021-07-30 13:27:39,"This article and the CDC statement is a confusing disappointment in that in lacks important nuance: it fails to distinguish between transmissibility among the vaccinated and unvaccinated.

It is difficult to believe COVID is as transmissible as chicken pox among the vaccinated. Where is the data?

With regards to viral load being concentrated in the nasal-pharygeal complex of vaccinated people, how is that transmitted in the absence of coughing or sneezing? And to whom is it transmitted ( vaccinated vs unvaccinated) and under what circumstances? If it's the hugging and kissing which takes places at family reunions, that behavior doesn't occur en masse in line at the grocery store.

The point is pretending everyone is equally at risk so we should all do the same thing is ineffective policy that has potential to undermine the value of the vaccine. It also runs the risk of ineffective policies at the state and local level. Perhaps bars and salons need to be regulated differently than grocery stores, for example.

The CDC needs to point out the clear advantages vaccinated people have over the unvaccinated, not obscure them."

At this point it appears to me that it’s only a matter of time before a new variant will be vaccine-resistant and we’re back to square one with another full-blown pandemic on our hands.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m very glad, and we are very fortunate to have a medicine that keeps us out of the hospital and alive, but when will it all end?

Even with the 1918 flu pandemic ended in a few years. Will this go on and on with no end in sight? Will this virus define our existence and the way we live life for the foreseeable future?

2021-07-30 13:39:35,"This is my understanding (it could be wrong). By not getting vaccinated within a certain window of time, the unvaccinated have continued the process of spreading the virus and allowing it to mutate. The new strains have gotten increasingly better at spreading through the population and now spread more rapidly through vaccinated people. So even if vaccinated people are better protected from developing devastating symptoms, they are now more likely to spread the illness. And now an increasing number of children are getting sick and dying. Since a large chunk of the population still resists getting vaccinated, it's likely that a new mutation will develop that will overcome or bypass the vaccine altogether. In other words, those people who refuse to get vaccinated are demanding their freedom to make a terrible situation worse."
2021-07-30 13:40:29,"It blows my mind that we are seeing more and more reporting on Delta and increased cases but there does not seem to be any urgency in stemming it.   

Enough.  We can see how far this trial of $100 to new vaccine recipients goes, but I suspect what will motivate more people to get vaccinated is when they find they can't go about their business as normal or are being ""left behind"". That means restricted or blocked access to air travel, trains, movie theatres, restaurants, hotels, sporting events etc. Airlines could have an upgrade lottery -- anyone showing proof of vaccination gets an opportunity for a free upgrade to first class. Nothing motivates people like FOMO. I fully support Danny Meyer's announcement yesterday that his restaurants will only permit the vaccinated and will seek out other places that do the same.

2021-07-30 13:49:20,"In the begining, people wore the masks because they feared death: no vaccine.  (In essense: it was all about YOU getting sick from someone else [and less about everyone].)  When the vax arrived, we were told that you won't get sick (or too sick, there was always X% vax effectiveness) but still use masks: the vax helped you but you could still get a transmissible ""subclinical infection"".  (In essense: it was less about you more about everyone.)  Now its all about EVERYONE, yet its been all about everyone, all along."
2021-07-30 13:50:19,"Isn't it time to implement mandatory vaccinations for everybody who is eligible? If the government doesn't have the fortitude to do this they can allow insurance companies to not cover covid for the unvaccinated. Alternatively it can allow insurance companies to raise the rates astronomically if people who present with covid and are unvaccinated. I think it's also time to have a national or global  vaccine passport. Don't allow the unvaccinated into enclosed public spaces at all. Let them kick and scream! Don't let them kill and infect the rest of us. Get the FDA to approve these vaccines! India shows we may reach herd immunity very quickly via Delta at Great human cost. I think the CDC needs to air on the side of caution regarding this virus. Carelessness from the beginning even under Trump has cost 600,000 plus lives and untold numbers of others. It has also eroded trust in the CDC. As we aren't tracking asymptomatic carriers only those who present we really have no picture of the spread among the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Consequently we need to look to Israel and the UK where testing is more rigorous to get a better picture of what we are experiencing. Why is this acceptable? Voluntary vaccinations have hit their limit it's time for harsher measures. Save our lives rather than our feelings. Let the toddlers whine as much as they want!"
2021-07-30 13:50:23,"Sometimes I feel we should blockade the states and or locations that refuse to recognize and deal with the issue. This is a public health issue not an individual rights issue.

And people who question the CDC, which fundamentally is okay, don't seem to realize that as the data changes so too do the solutions. It's as simple and as complex as that."
2021-07-30 13:51:50,"I realize there is still work to do in getting more people vaccinated.  However, we should start the booster shot process now.  It will take months to administer boosters and data is showing that vaccinations' protections wane.  Let's follow other country's lead and start giving boosters to those 60 (not 65) and older or immune compromised.  Otherwise, we may see more illness because we started giving boosters late."
2021-07-30 13:52:43,"The calculated R value for delta is ~8 compared to a value close to 2 for the virus circulating last winter.  

The difference?
1 => 2 => 4 => 8=> 16 (three weeks)
1=> 8 => 64 => 512 => 4096 (three weeks)

This is why unvaccinated India was walloped.

It's not that bad (yet) here because half the adults are vaccinated.
But even in places with high vaccination rates the virus is spreading: 653 of 882 cases in Provincetown were among the vaccinated.

Virus counts in Boston sewer water have increased 5-fold in 3 weeks (R ~ 2.2) in a population that is 75% vaccinated.  This indicates the delta virus is as transmissible among the vaccinated as the pre-delta variant was before the vaccine.   

And even the vaccinated are getting long-haul covid, even if many of the vaccinated are getting mild cases (severe cold, that knock you off your feet for a week).  
And even the vaccinated are getting hospitalized.  
And even the vaccinated are dying.
And kids can't get the vaccine
And some responsible older folks can't get vaccinated.

But those that can and don't? If you get sick and kill someone, I will support prosecution, even if it is your grandmother that dies, but particularly if it is mine!"
2021-07-30 13:53:05,"I hate that politics have gotten tangled up in science and medicine. I lay most of the blame at Trump's door, but the politicians who drag their feet, forbid mask mandates, and yammer on about personal freedoms when it directly conflicts with measures to keep people alive bear that burden too. They are killing people. People are dying because they are listening to people in power who think science is a joke. I dearly wish I could hand each politician a list of how many have died because of falsehoods they have declared as truth."

2021-07-30 13:54:53,"This pandemic was something controllable at the beginning and politicizing it let the genie out of the bottle. Now we have several vaccines, which are the solution to the problem but instead of using them, we are bickering about ""health freedom"", while the virus is happily testing new mutations to become more efficient. Will these people listen when the lethality of the virus becomes similar to that of Ebola?"

2021-07-30 13:57:22,"The subheading is confusing, implying the delta virus is more like to lead to severe illness in vaccinated people than unvaccinated. The last 2 paragraphs waylay those concerns but many people won't bother reading to that  point. I would have led with the ending in the subheading: : ""Infection in vaccinated Americans also may be as transmissible as those in unvaccinated people, the document said, but vaccinations continue to protect strongly against worse outcomes"". this message needs to be made clear repeatedly."
2021-07-30 13:57:49,Vaccination is our civic duty to protect ourselves and others. This is really the best way to combat the pandemic. The unvaccinated are behaving in a very selfish and ignorant manner.  It is really time for a widespread government mandate.

2021-07-30 13:58:59,"Epidemiologists have been screaming this for the last six weeks. The CDC’s messaging and incoherence continues to endanger Americans and embolden the arrogant indifference of vaccinated people who think they’re above it all at this point. Public health is population health. With infectious disease, we live and die together, no matter how you *feel* about it. And if you aren’t afraid of a breakthrough infection, you should be. Long Covid can result from mild — even asymptomatic — infections. Early data suggests 20% of mild symptomatic breakthrough infections result in long covid symptoms. As someone who lives with Dysautonomia, I can tell you you want to avoid it at all costs."
2021-07-30 13:59:19,"The most devastating effect of the those unvaccinated fools passing the Delta variation to the careful vaccinated is that the Delta variants will evolve strains that are evermore more vaccine resistant and contagious. Both the mutations within the vaccinated that survive the vaccine induced antibodies, and the mutations within the unvaccinated that facilitate infection in the vaccinated will be the ones that evolution favors.  Yes, evolution is a fact about all creatures, humans and viruses."
2021-07-30 13:59:45,"It remains the case that the vaccinated transmit at a substantially lower rate than the unvaccinated. It is also the case that for the vaccinated a breakthrough infection is akin to a cold (granted, with the rare possibility of serious complications). All of this remains an issue due to the large number of unvaccinated who transmit at a higher rate and are at far higher risk of hospitalization and death when infected.
I don’t know why the CDC is so circumspect in saying this: We are about to put on the masks again so as to make the unvaccinated mask and to protect the unvaccinated from dying from this disease. It’s just so frustrating to have half of the population sneer at a vaccine while the other half is going out of its way to protect them from doing harm to themselves. At some point you have to throw up your hands and repeat the truth: “God helps those who help themselves.”"
2021-07-30 13:59:57,"I read the subheading of this article several times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding, and it still reads as though vaccinated people become more severely ill with Covid than those who aren't vaccinated. This is completely untrue (and the article correctly states the opposite)."
2021-07-30 14:00:04,"I know people who have been angry with the CDC over how they have handled things (including about letting people know about nutrition and lifting mask mandate). For me, that it took a leaked memo to get this latest info out (!) is my line in the sand of trust."
2021-07-30 14:00:49,COVID-21 high vax rate areas also can be popular areas for  unvaxxed tourists coming in by automobile who don't have to show vax cards or test results as on an airplane trip. These unvaxxed people coming into a tourist city would probably also shun masks  given with some a lack of respect for COVID-21 to  avoid being vaccinated. So everyone in any tourist city needs to mask up indoors whether their political leaders have the courage to reinstate masking mandates or not.

Those who choose not to be vaccinated should be barred from public transportation and public institutions, along with any reputable, civic minded place of work..
In the meantime, we should vote with our feet and not patronize businesses who do not require mask mandates and vaccination requirements. 
 Would you want your hospitalized family member cared for by someone who isn't vaccinated? Choose medical facilities, cruises, concerts, resorts, etc, that require vaccinations. In the future, that should should be extended to planes as well."

Once again, they can't possibly know this because *they are not tracking breakthrough infections* in people who are not hospitalized!!  It may be rare among the people they are tracking, those in the hospital.  That's not the same thing and it's starting to seem like they are pulling the wool over our eyes when they make these unsubstantiated statements."
2021-07-30 14:07:29,"The idea that we have to vaccinate the world in order to keep ourselves protected seems incredibly hubristic. Having worked in a country like Liberia, it is preposterous to assume that a country like that would take a newly developed vaccine for a virus whose mortality rate is under 2%. These resilient people contend with malaria, Dengue—even Ebola at one point—remaining outbreaks of polio.  These viruses have death rates exponentially higher than Covid, some 1000 times higher. Death is not a rare event for much of the world where a child can die of a bug bite, malaria, diarrhea—the list goes on. This is where we as Westerners need to ""check our privilege"" and wake up to the fact that our gloriously comfortable lives will sometimes be interrupted. We need to harness some of the resilience that the developing world shows everyday and start to live with, and treat better, the disease of Covid 19."
2021-07-30 14:07:38,"The CDC lead us to believe that outdoor transmission was possible or even likely based on faulty readings of one study. This much was proven by one in depth NYT article (A Misleading CDC Number, published May 25, 2021). Now we are supposed to be freaking out again over Delta based on an internal slide presentation that hasn’t been released and there has been zero data presented for scientists to analyze. Also there is no mention of the fact that Delta is waning in the UK where it has been spreading for longer. I’m not going to panic just yet, but thanks for trying. I would appreciate having a federal QR code for showing my vaccination status. If vaccination is so important give us something to prove it!"
2021-07-30 14:08:31,"All the complaints about CDC ""credibility"" in the face of massive amounts of data and information that we have to process about the virus on a daily basis, are simply a setup to argue to do nothing that restricts people's ""freedom."""

2021-07-30 14:09:52,"The current 4th wave is likely larger than reported estimates because testing is limited.    So we're not seeing absolute accurate numbers but an estimate.  It's not a problem with the test showing what it finds, but the interpretation of what it represents in the population.

Many vaccinated people who get infected won't go to a doctor or get tested.  So, the alarming number of breakthrough cases under reports the condition.   

Just as asymptomatic people could  spread  the  virus from day one, now vaccinated people can spread the virus just the same as the unvaccinated.   Boy that takes work to understand.   It means we're back to everyone, anyone being a vector regardless of appearance, symptom, or vaccine history.

2021-07-30 14:13:53,"When some of the leading infectious disease experts in the UK (the most heavily vaccinated country in the world apart from Israel) are now saying they don't expect anyone who cares about their health and longevity to watch sporting matches in crowded bars ever again in their lifetimes, you can be pretty sure the SARS-Cov2 virus and covid disease will be with us for a very long time. Obviously politicians and public health agencies around the world are cagey about all this. They're trying to keep the economy going, themselves in office and the population from panicking and rioting in the streets. The one thing we can be pretty sure about is: this fall, winter and spring are unlikely to be appreciably better than last fall, winter and spring, even if we succeed in cajoling more people to get immunized. How that will be managed from a healthcare, public health and public order perspective, and the political and economic implications, are far less certain. Further social and economic disruption is pretty much inevitable. The lull this summer is just that, and by the numbers is no better in terms of covid incidence than last summer, before immunization programs even began. Moreover, covid cases are sharply on the rise again in the two places which recently ""opened up"" -- the UK and US, the apparent drop in cases in the former now known to be drop in testing, not a drop in new infections."
2021-07-30 14:14:18,Dr Walensky says that transmission is rare from those who are vaccinated. Great. She is the expert who knows more of virology than most anyone. Yet this article and many others are focusing on the dangers to vaccinated people than those who are not vaccinated. I’m vaccinated. I’m not worried. Let those who are not vaccinated beware. Let those states that are playing down mask wearing and vaccine now deal with economics of infection.
2021-07-30 14:15:24,"I really don’t understand why people are panicking. The fact that vaccinated people can spread the virus has been known for months from studies in Israel. What is also known from the same studies is that vaccines reduce the severity of illness by more than 90 percent, in most cases rendering it asymptomatic or no more than a cold. In Israel more than 97 percent of people hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated. Mask mandates are an unnecessary annoyance. What is needed is the universal vaccine mandate. I am vaccinated, and I am only going to wear a mask on the plane and in very crowded places to protect myself from a heavy virus load. I don’t care what happens to the unvaccinated. If you are immunocompromised, stay home. You can’t expect the rest of the world to come to a standstill for you. And if you believe that vaccines contain microchips, well, there is something called natural selection, and it’s long time overdue we bring it back to bear on the human race."
2021-07-30 14:16:07,"There is a significant difference between the two headers. One says it causes more severe disease in vaccinated, the other just refers to transmission. Please explain it correct. Obviously severe disease among vaccinated is THE problem most of us care about."
2021-07-30 14:16:10,"This fear of Covid19 and specifically the delta variant seems totally misplaced and selfish to the extreme. We will never stop this virus regardless of what we do. It is a remarkably adaptable organism that due to its high replication rate, evolves extraordinarily rapidly. Delta can avoid the immune response to the alpha variant reasonably well, and biology predicts that new forms of delta will arise that very effectively avoid the immune response to the alpha variant. 

The damage we have done to society by the lockdowns, limitations on economic activity, etc. are immense, and in my view much greater than the damage done by the disease itself. I believe it is time for society to move on and accept that this virus, along with the associated illness and deaths, will be with us forever. Hopefully we will be able to come up with more effective treatments, but until then it is time to get on with life."

It needs to be made abundantly clear by outlets like the times that vaccinated people do not spread delta more readily or face nearly the level of risk unvaccinated people face after infection. Does NYT really not understand how many people will only read that introduction and either gain an irrational fear of vaccinated people or a justification for avoiding vaccination?"
2021-07-30 14:19:35,"There seems to be a willingness to blame the unvaccinated for the spread but, thanks to the disclosure of the CDC internal document, we know now that the unvaccinated can spread it just as easily.  Again, rather than blaming everyone else, we should look at our own behavior--even those of us who are fully vaccinated--and see what we can do to stop the spread.  That means we will have to mask up when indoors in public.  I am on an island now, and I don't see many people masking up.   This is not binary, the way people want to believe.  The vaccines, while excellent, do not confer total immunity.  Vaccination plus mask is the best strategy to protect oneself and others."

In America we have constitutional liberties that let us choose not to take a vaccine. That’s fine and dandy. God bless America. But if we clog up the hospitals and clinics because we are sick then we infringe on our fellow citizens’ life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. This is not right."
2021-07-30 13:03:44,"So, even with being fully vaccinated, in many ways we are reverting BACK to where we were a year ago - face mask mandates, safe distancing from folks, continued thorough and frequent hand washing.

I guess the big July 4th hoopla in which thousands and thousands gathered was not only premature but reckless.

I am the first one to scream from the top of the highest building that I need all of this virus stuff to be behind us - permanently.  However, as long as half of the country continues to refuse vaccinations AND the wearing of face masks, I worry that we will be where we were a year ago.

Later  we were ridiculed for refusing to take off our masks and still socially distance even though we were  vaccinated because the CDC said we should take masks off.

It is one thing to be ridiculed by the anti vaxx or QAnon crowd but to be put down by the so called science experts is another thing. It is blatantly obvious that these are political organizations not health or science based organizations.  Gotta open up for the economy and pretend all is good. They are completely useless and if we listened to them we would probably be dead.

That would make delta roughly 500% more transmissible than the original China virus (Ro=2-3) and nearly as transmissible as measles--the most transmissible common infection known.

This doesn't make sense to me--studies in Britain and Israel estimated something like 50%-70% greater transmissability versus the beta variant, which itself was about 50% more transmissible than the China virus.   But taken together, these figures imply only about 250% increase--very high but far lower than chickenpox and measles.   

I'm wondering whether CDC is engaging in a bit of hyperbole.  Or perhaps earlier estimates were simply too low ?   Whatever the case, this news seems inconsistent with previous science and requires explanation !"

Given India's huge population, not sure how India could have vaccinated many more of its people by April, the sheer volume of vaccine requirement is so huge even with its local manufacturers India just couldn't ramp up overnight to billion doses production, not to mention the vaccine hesitancy and lackadaisical attitude among the general population with covid precautions. Anyways, majority 45+ population got at least one shot, there are still some hesitancy among the population but more vaccine types should be available there in next few months. They also have one nasal vaccine in the trial which should be more effective against Delta given its high viral load in the breathing tracts."

I would think most governors have the power to order mandatory vaccinations for all teachers and students, pre-school through college.  Whether public health laws could extend that to private sector firms beyond nursing homes is a legal question I don't feel competent to answer.   So far, even for nursing homes, Governor Hogan in Maryland has left it to individual companies to require it or not.  That's not going to cut it in the fall of 2020.

Vaccination is a citizen obligation to others, and for the Christian Republican Right, it ought to be the Christian thing to do - but then again, so would supporting National Health Insurance.

The response of the Republican Right gives a whole new meaning to the term ""Give me Liberty or give me Death."""
2021-07-30 14:39:35,"People are waking up to the propensity of the virus to mutate fast.  Universal masking and vaccination may slow this.  The roll out of vaccine for school children needs to be accelerated, if possible.  Their parents and guardians must be vaccinated for them to attend."
2021-07-30 14:43:36,"This data has been leaked to GOP already, Republicans last week were complaining the CDC did not have data to mandate masks. This was nationwide coordinated message by GOP in states, so someone in national party had CDC info and devised messaging for state leaders."

My friends all know of multiple people who have breakthrough infections, and even the Provincetown study mentioned in the article indicates hundreds of vaccinated people were infected at the 4th of July celebration (this was a rare instance where all infections were recorded, not just the ones that were hospitalized)

the vaccines are still modern miracles, and vaccinated people have almost no risk of ending up in the hospital. but the fact remains that we can spread it, and also possibly open ourselves up to Long haul covid symptoms. I'll wear my mask, thank you."

Texas and Florida together  are currently averaging 2 deaths per million per day 

New York and California  together are averaging    .6   deaths per million per day 

So Texas and Florida started at a higher base 
They are also increasing infections at a higher rate 

28 day rate of increase in New York and California combined 
5.8 x 

28 day rare of increase in Texas and Florida combined 
8.3 x 

Florida and Texas have about 2/3 the population of California and Florida but already have more than double the death numbers, triple the death rate  and they are pulling away based on infections."

Acknowledge that some people are not going to read to the end of an article, or even the seventh paragraph in this case. LEAD with the critical information - vaccines help prevent hospitalization and death even with the Delta variant! Don’t bury it at the end."
2021-07-30 13:37:13,"Simple math:

35K symptomatic infections/162MM vaccinated citizens means a 0.0002116% change of symptomatic infection for vaccinated people. That is not even a rounding error. The NYT specifically and media in general is doing a grave disservice to the nation in even implying that vaccination is not doing its job.

Some thoughts:

a) above all, the FDA needs to get off the can and approve at least the RNA vaccines without limitations. Calling it ""emergency use"" after the ocean of data showing benefit vs risk allows anti-vaxxers to obfuscate there essential selfishness in not getting vaccinated.

b) Lets' get 90-95% of the population vaccinated before we try to headline the theoretical infections caused by the vaccinated versus the obvious outbreaks in areas of low vaccination. 

c) for anti-vaxxers who call the vaccines risky, how about NYT doing its job and giving detailed information about the degree of illness and death in the unvaccinated caused by Delta?"

My brother-in-law works in a union in NYC - he refuses to get the shot because ""he doesn't want people telling him what to do."" Totally ignorance and stupidity. His wife isn't getting it and they have a few kids. People like this will never be convinced.

America better get used to living with and wearing masks from here on out. Covid isn't going away anytime soon and with people like my brother-in-law, it will be with us for years and years. More people will get sick, more people will die and businesses will never return to what they were pre-Covid.

If people want their freedom, then they need to get vaccinated so we can go out and enjoy those freedoms with our friends and families. There is no other alternative except sickness and death."

2021-07-30 11:54:29,"The Times really needs to stop publishing articles that anticipate what the CDC might report about what might be true about COVID transmission.  This is not helpful.  This piece, for example, mentions viral loads in the noses of vaccinated people and the risk of transmission before the following quote appears.

“Dr. Walensky has called transmission by vaccinated people a rare event, but other scientists have suggested it may be more common than once thought.”

Which scientists?  How much more common than “rare?” If the viral load in the noses of the vaccinated is critically important, why hasn’t the CDC issued an alert? It would seem prudent to do so.  I don’t know the answer and quite possibly this reporter doesn’t either.  So, maybe the most prudent and helpful course would be to just wait for the official answers instead of publishing.  The press is contributing to public confusion and conflict."
2021-07-30 13:23:15,"While it's good to see the CDC taking a more evidence based approach in its masks guidelines, it's still frustrating that Dr. Rochelle Walensky and her team are dragging their feet in two crucial areas now with the delta variant--the need for vaccine boosters, and a more full accounting of breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated patients, which CDC should have never stopped tracking in May of 2021. Latest data out of Israel especially are alarming on vulnerability of even fully vaccinated people to delta, esp. those who got their shots 4 to 6 months ago, to any variant.  Not all of it has been published (or translated from Hebrew) yet but early reports show after around 5 to 6 months, immunity from Pfizer vaccine falls sharply, and hospitals in Israel (and Britain) are now filling up with vaccinated patients having severe breakthrough infections. They're already starting boosters in Israel and Turkey even earlier, and given the size of the US and vulnerable population, we should be moving now on announcing and preparing boosters esp. for Americans who who got vaccinated in January or February, it's crazy to be hesitating here.

And again, the CDC needs to be tracking and reporting on all breakthrough cases, it was irresponsible to stop doing this in May. The large majority of breakthrough cases in the COVID-19 delta outbreaks in Provincetown and Las Vegas hospital were fully vaccinated, many died  or hospitalized, but even ""mild"" cases can cause long COVID. We need this data."

Last time I checked ""unvaccinated"" was not a protected class, like sex, race, religion, etc.

2021-07-30 14:46:27,"Dr. Jha at Brown wondered yesterday why the FDA was not expediting full approval of the vaccines.   The Biden administration does not want to be seen pushing the FDA for fear it will increase, not decrease, mistrust.  FDA full approval will help.  

Another thing that would help is Former Guy getting on NewsMax, Fox, and the other right wing propaganda channels and websites and telling his worshipers to get vaccinated.  Desperate measures are called for."

It is not a matter of fear. It is not a matter of impact to the family (who are all, even Trumpians, vaccinated). He is undeterred by the seriousness of the Delta variant. He is oblivious to the likelihood of his hospitalization or possible death. Or, the effect on his beloved pet cat becoming infected as well. He evidences no concern that he endangers his immunocompromised parents or other's unvaccinated children. Not shaming. Nothing. 
He willfully dismisses all information, all data, all evidence, any argument, any concern, shutting himself up in angry isolation at the attempts. It is a stubbornness, an immaturity at 28 years, a result of peers on line who are as resistant and reinforcing of this refusal... as a badge of courage, personal integrity, visceral resistance to the vaccine unlike any. The fact that he has had numerous inoculations and vaccinations before, is of no importance. This is different. It is a force of nature that will see him dead before he vaccinates. Like the belief in Trump, it has no bearing on the reality of the disease, it is a blind, willfully blinded, uneducable ""terrible two's"" ""NO!"".
And, he is not alone. I am at a loss of what to do."

2021-07-30 14:55:40,"I am worried that the delta variant is not the end of the virus' mutations.  There are parts of our world where the virus is spreading into large groups of unvaccinated populace. Each global area is a huge ""petri dish"" of infected people, any one of them could produce a more virulent and dangerous Covid mutant/variant. And it could only take one infected person to spread their new variant of Covid to other areas of the world very quickly.
The CDC now says that the delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox, an extremely contagious, easily transmissible disease. This is very bad.
Even though I am vaccinated, I have been continuing to wear my KN95 mask in public indoor areas and outdoors when near crowds/groups of people. I hate wearing the facemask, but I feel it is necessary to do so to protect myself.
I truly fear that this coming winter may be worse that last winter in regards to covid related illness and deaths. I hope that I am wrong about the next 6 months or so, but I will continue to hope for the best and prepare for the worst."

And the Delta variant, while worse than others, may not be the worse one we see. Of course if 90% of ALL adults had been vaccinated by now, all of the problems and unknowns would be less worrisome.

If these vaccines are so dang dangerous, how come people who have not been vaccinated are largely the ones getting sick and dying from COVID?"

I'm fully vaccinated, and I won't stop masking because we don't have enough information to keep changing up the guidelines. Introducing too many variables skews the results, the data and we are doing too many 180 turns at once. Too quick to throw the progress back.

2021-07-30 15:14:19,"It was widely reported that the first three waves of covid-19 disproportionally affected minorities.  I'm interested to see the demographics involved in this next wave of hospitalizations and deaths.  

From what I've been reading and watching these last months, most of those who refuse to get vaccinated or wear masks, do so for political ""reasons"" - with ""freedom"" and ""the constitution"" the most often cited specifics.  The same terms that were most often belted out by the frenzied mob during the January 6th insurrection based on The Big Lie.

Because the evidence shows that the combination of getting vaccinated, wearing masks, and social distancing reduce the likelihood of severe covid-19 cases, I'm guessing the demographic makeup of the physically damaged and dead from this new wave (and subsequent waves) will likely be sorely different from the first three.

Since vaccinations seem to protect against serious illness and death, let’s focus on the remaining low-hanging fruit. 
ICU space? Maybe allow hospitals to de-prioritize unvaxed covid patients in favor of other emergencies if space becomes an issue again.

We gave the virus free reign to mutate in vigorous fashion so that now we have the Delta virus, and, guess what, it is coming back to hit us.  What do they say?  What goes around, comes around?"
2021-07-30 15:24:01,"But what level of risk are we talking about?  If the vaccines reduce the risk of serious disease and death by an order of magnitude or more, I don’t see any justification for heavy handed public health interventions or mandates. The level of risk just isn’t high enough."

This is a terrifying development. That doesn't mean 5-6 times as infections, that means 5-6 times exponential infections.

If the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) was around 2 in the original virus I am concerned for those that may have contracted this new variant. Even a slightly higher number (and particularly for younger people) could be devastating."

But if you are one of the unlucky thousands that suffer the negative side effects of the drugs, then how lucky do you feel?

Here's my take on the vaccines; if you want to get the vaccine then absolutely do.  If do not want the vaccine, then don't.

What should be happening is that everyone vaccinated or not, should be wearing an N95 mask when you leave your home.  It's still our best chance of staying well."

This agency should be going at warp speed at this point.  The vaccines have been used by over a hundred million citizens, have prevented untold cases, and are safe for almost everyone.  What the Sam Hill are they waiting for?  The same way Trump threatened to fire FDA officials if they didn’t release the vaccine by next week, Biden should make the same promise.  After all at this point does anyone believe FDA will not approve the vaccines?"
2021-07-30 15:46:12,"How do we know transmission between the vaccinated is very rare? The NYT reported on May 28 that he CDC was no longer reporting breakthrough cases unless they were severe or required hospitalization. Has this changed?

Proof of vaccination should now be required to fly, enter a restaurant, entertainment venues, as well as colleges and universities. 
I am furious that all of this is the fault of those who willfully refused to be vaccinated, mostly due to the dangerous rhetoric of Republicans. The worst part is most of them see themselves as being oppressed and are comparing themselves to victims of Nazism. 
I was fully vaccinated in March -- I thought we had turned the corner. I still wore my mask in stores and vowed to do so until 85% of the population was fully vaccinated. I did my part. Now I am once again afraid to go to the grocery store, pump gas, and even walk by strangers not wearing masks."
2021-07-30 15:46:18,"CDC has a credibility problem. Any person reading the news over the past year could clearly see the Delta variant is highly transmissible as evidenced by the spread in India and the UK. To issue a statement, supported by Biden, that masks are no longer required anywhere, indoors or outdoors, for vaccinated people is dangerous in the face of the delta variant. Add to that Jill Biden coming to Maine with some pablum on how good the air smells maskless thereby reinforcing that feel good sentiment to just enjoy the summer with concerts bbqs sporting events…. Political games being played at the expense of people. CDC issued the wrong guidance to go maskless indoors at the exact time when the delta variant was spreading. Who can believe the CDC scientists anymore? Or the CDC bureaucrats? Or the government? Biden or Trump - both are playing for political points in a pandemic and people pay the price"
2021-07-30 15:56:43,Biden Administration and CDC didn’t take Delta  variants seriously .  They should allow Booster shots immediately..
2021-07-30 15:45:43,"So, a nee variant is tearing across the country, it’s apparently more contagious and more dangerous than the previous variants, schools are opening, and we still don’t have a vaccine for children. 

Can we speed this up, please?"
2021-07-30 15:43:29,"Recently we had a small family reunion--9 adults, 3 children. Two families flew from the west coast the the east coast for this. All adults were vaccinated and the one 17-year-old was vaccinated (all either Pfizer or Moderna). The 10-year-old and 14-year-old were not. We were together on and off for about 5 days and in the end 3 out of the 9 adults came down with Covid. That's a 33% breakthough rate among the adults. Fortunately, our cases were not severe, but we were definitely sick. (I myself was one of the Covid positive and had serious, flu-like fatigue for two days. All I wanted to do was sleep.) We'd thought the vaccine would protect us better. Clearly we were wrong. 

This experience makes me fearful for what might be coming up in the fall. Our family experience suggests that Covid--probably in the form of the Delta variant--might be fairly powerful at blasting through the vaccine. People should NOT think they can't get Covid at all because they are vaccinated. 

This is by no means to suggest that the vaccine isn't important. Rather, I am very thankful that I was vaccinated (I got both shots of Pfizer back in April) since it in all likelihood made my own case not too serious. I am afraid for what Covid would have done to do me if it had be allowed to hit me full force. I can imagine I would have been utterly miserable. If you are not vaccinated, please do yourself (and your friends, family and fellow citizens) a favor and go for it. Get the vaccine."
2021-07-30 10:30:28,"Mandatory vaccination, immediately. 

That means no vaccination = no air travel, no movies, no theme parks, no schooling, no restaurants, and so forth. 

Yes, we need exclusions for the medically compromised— but that’s so obvious it should go without saying. The willfully unvaccinated are ruining things for the rest of us, and they need to be stopped now."

2) Delta variant is affecting the unvaccinated, not the vaccinated.

3) We need to wear masks again.

Here's the truth:

If you're scared of COVID, get a vaccine.

If you're not, take your chances and don't get the vaccine.

2021-07-30 16:03:49,"I am a big believer in vaccines particularly mRNA technology. I volunteered, unsuccessfully for the Moderna trials.  My wife and I got vaccinated as soon as we were eligible. 

That being said I don't believe a word the CDC or many other government health agencies have to say. Their pattern seems to be to tell whatever lie they think needs to be heard.  This is why they can't convince the unvaccinated. They simply have no credibility.

As for there latest ridiculous claims what are they basing it on ? Have they calculated the R0 for delta covid and compared it to chickenpox and ebola ?   Not more than three weeks ago they were saying the vaccinated did not need to wear masks. Now they say the vaccinated carry viral loads as great as the unvaccinated. When did they make this discovery ? What studies are they based on ?

Even more concerning is that there is increasing evidence from around the world that the vaccines lose effectiveness over time. The corollary is that booster shots are needed. What do the CDC and Faucci have to say about it ?  More lies. ""Boosters are not needed"", followed by ""Maybe the imunno  comprimised need boosters."""

There are 2 problems to address. 1) HOW it spreads. 2) WHY it spreads. The answer to 1) HOW will be in terms of medical science and epidemiology to which, no matter the details, the appropriate life-saving response is MASKS + VACCINATION. The answer to 2) WHY is that a large number of Republican Politicians are reprehensibly using this national health crisis to further an equally reprehensible agenda, the mechanism for which is to inflame their base and subject them all, and us as well, to life-threatening disease and certain death for a great number, which I'm sure they view as acceptable collateral damage. The appropriate life-saving response to 2) is GET RID OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE REPREHENSIBLE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS by vote, or immediate recall if their state's constitutions permit it. Sound crazy? It won't in a couple of months when thousands of Red State residents start dying - and taking many of us with them. So, 1) Vaccinate and Mask and 2) Get rid of the Republicans who are advancing their One-Party America agenda by *unnecessarily* *literally* *killing* untold numbers of their own Rank and File - AND US."

If you aren't willing to help protect your community, you should have no right to participate in it. No flights, no jobs, no schools, no shopping, etc. There is no both sides of this issue. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Mandatory vaccines. Period."
2021-07-30 16:12:58,"There is only one solution that will get people who refuse to get vaccinated for COVID-19 to change their minds and do the right thing to protect themselves and society.

All health insurance policies should exclude coverage for people infected with COVID-19 if they are not vaccinated.  Once people realize that they are personally on the hook for their medical bills maybe common sense will prevail.

It's ridiculous for everyone's health care and insurance costs to skyrocket because a certain percentage of the population refuses to do the right thing.

Insurance companies already exclude coverage for a variety of reasons in all types of policies.  By making vaccination a condition for getting benefits for a COVID-19 infection, insurance companies can play an important role in helping to squash the pandemic (at least in those countries that have health insurance)."
2021-07-30 16:16:02,"Flying into the USA from SE Asia this week, I was struck by  variation in attitudes toward public health within my home country, as well as by  fairly common rejection of Covid 19 vaccines. Within the San Francisco Bay area alone, I saw areas with 100% compliance toward mask mandates, while in another community less than 10 miles away, the majority were exercising 'choice' to crowd into small unventilated spaces without masks. In SE Asia, people are desperate to get effective vaccines. In the USA vaccines can be gotten free of charge, and yet many choose to remain unvaccinated. What will it take to educate the public to the simple fact that until everyone is vaccinated, the virus will continue to infect and mutate? The vaccinated will not themselves become seriously ill, but as long as there's a pool of unvaccinated, anyone can be a carrier. SE Asia is learning the downside of half way measures, with infections rapidly increasing through the summer. Autumn will bring similar pain to developed countries in the Northern Hemisphere, unless the CDC's new recommendations are followed."

Make these vaccines mandatory, now. I'm not saying kick down people's doors and jab them like Fox would like you to believe - just tie insurance premiums to them. Make them required to get on a plane, go to school or a theater. 

My sympathy and understanding is gone. I'm sick of sharing a country with people who willfully disregard the safety of their countrymen. Vax up or stay locked down and away from the rest of us with a sense of national pride."
2021-07-30 16:17:21,"And yet we remain so divided politically on implementing the most basic measures of containment.  

The platform enabled by cynical politicians is providing this virus all it needs to mutate ahead of any remedy we can concoct.  Internal and international politics are restraining distribution and use of the vaccine and look poised to usher permanent changes in our world beyond anything we recognize–or want.  

Whatever hope we’ve been holding onto is rapidly becoming more elusive, as nothing appears on the horizon to change attitudes about accepting the vaccination personally or in distributing it globally.  If enough people stay vulnerable in the country or the world, then none of us are safe and neither are the norms or institutions that anchor our societies."
2021-07-30 16:21:49,"I'm as paranoid (almost) as anyone and I have been religiously protecting myself including mask wearing, etc. However, this may give some measure of calm for those of you who are vaccinated: if there are approximately 35,000 symptomatic infections among the 162 million vaccinated Americans (CDC, as of 7.24.21) then the actual infection rate is  approximately 0.0216 out of 100, significantly less than 1%. Assuming unidentified cases and the infection rate is doubled to 70,000 the chances of an infection, as of 7.24.21 would be 0.0432 out of 100.  Please check my math and post if these numbers are wrong."

2021-07-30 16:49:33,"The delta variant notwithstanding the possibility of infecting people even when you are vaccinated has always been factual. 

You have to be infected for the vaccine to ""work"". While infected and before your immune system kills it all you can shed the active virus and infect others. That is normally a low risk situation. But since GQP propaganda has been so effective at creating and extending this pandemic the eventuality Fauci was afraid might come to pass last year, has. A new more virulent variant of the virus. 

People need to know that so they get why the accelerated growth of the Delta Variant even in vaccinated people makes that risk of the vaccinated spreading the virus when infected a dead certainty now."
2021-07-30 16:50:45,"Please include or link data in these pieces. I’m still seeing published accounts indicating more than 95% of people hospitalized for COVID are unvaccinated. Can we see data on unvaccinated becoming seriously sick, as opposed to merely seropositive? Last week published reports noted slightly over 5000 “breakthrough” infections out of over 160,000,000 vaccinated Americans. If these numbers have significantly changed, what are they? People will tune out and do whatever their biases tell them to if you are not more concrete."
2021-07-30 16:24:29,"Ah, chickenpox. I remember spending time in bed with that stuff as all the kids got it back then, and the mumps, too. The doctors had invented a shot for measles, but not mumps or chickenpox. Those diseases were added a little later; we were celebrating a parade of vaccines—tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, rubella, each one meaning one less thing to be sick with, and combination shots that made it quicker to get protected. Now it’s 2021 and they came out with a Covid shot in less than a year. Why are we inflicting so much agony on ourselves, instead of getting vaccinated for it?"
2021-07-30 16:29:46,"At this point in the pandemic, our scientists need to start recognizing that we cannot play God. We will never eliminate this virus entirely (and I’m skeptical we ever could). The best we can do is push people to get vaccinated, even though they may kick and scream and refuse. Eventually, COVID-19 will become endemic and relatively harmless in all likelihood.

I know this may sound a lot like the people last year who were advocating (or violently threatening) to not wear masks and placing all their trust in some distant ideal of herd immunity.

But with the vaccine, the equation has changed quite a bit. If those who are inoculated are extremely unlikely to develop serious sickness, why must we continue to coddle those who cannot and will not be persuaded? This is, at worst, an ethically neutral position to take. I do recognize, though, that most countries are not in the same position we are with vaccines."
2021-07-30 16:49:26,"The Delta variant was entirely predictable.  A virus will naturally evolve to infect the greatest number of people--that's how it survives as a species (survival of the fittest, and all that)--especially if people aren't vaccinated.  If it can create and spread more viral particles, eventually it will.

Unfortunately for us, viral load makes a bit difference in the severity of illness.  Small viral loads lead to milder cases, but this variant produces viral loads a thousandfold greater than the alpha variant.

So, unfortunately, a lot of people are going to get very sick. Many will die.

But this variant is so contagious that it's likely to burn itself out--run out of people to infect--more rapidly than the alpha variant.  An example is India, which has already experienced a steep decline in infections."

2021-07-30 16:33:51,"The vaccine only protects the vaxxed with ""mild"" symptoms in the event of infection but the evidence is increasingly proving that is not true.  The vaxxed and the unvaxxed are spreaders.  Mask up everyone and avoid crowds when possible. 

At this point I cannot blame the unvaccinated for waiting for a less leaky vaccine that is one, or at most two, and done.  Who wants to take 3-4  shots of a novel vaccine whose long-term effects are not yet known?  Even the flu shot is only 1x/year."
2021-07-30 17:03:40,Trumpers didn’t take Covid seriously at the peak of the pandemic.

2021-07-30 15:58:25,"If the immune compromised are said to need to wear masks, does the CDC now judge that simple masks offer protection to the wearer? That's the opposite of the science they once said existed, the opposite of all pre-Covid pandemic measures.

If masks worked, would infection curves only go down after they were implemented, and wouldn't we have not had waves of infections after the mandates were put in place?

How harmful is the new variant, as infections alone (testing positive) are not disease, hospitalization or death?

It seems that vaccinated people are now the new super-spreaders."

So what is the panic all about?   

Last year over 700 k people in the USA died of heart disease.  Yet fast food restaurants remain open despite."
2021-07-30 17:16:52,"The alarmism in this article is jaw shattering. Most studies have shown that the delta variant is more transmissable (yes) but not more dangerous. (no one really knows) But the chart from CDC shows the delta variant is slightly more deadly than seasonal/swine flu and is nowhere as deadly as MERS or Smallpox, Ebola, etc. And the fact that the delta variant spreads so quickly means millions have been exposed, had minimal symptoms, and now have some sort of immunity. (good/fair)
But now the media is piling on and spreading fear which is what they love to do. So let's end here with the last quote of this actual article: Overall, Delta is the troubling variant we already knew it was,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. “But the sky isn’t falling and vaccination still protects strongly against the worse outcomes.”"

At first scientists thought  it was the naughty offspring of a virus we already knew.   Ow it has morphed into a Delta variant.  How many more varieties will there be?  That alone is enough reason to be vaccinated early and get a booster when possible.

That does not fit with my definition of rare."
2021-07-30 17:35:50,"Sadly, while the Pfizer vaccine, after two doses is excellent at preventing death and hospitalisation: estimated range 95% to 98% reduction in respect of the Delta variant but it does not provide sterilising immunity. In the UK, research papers published by Public Health England and the UK's Office of National Statistics indicate that symptomatic, but mild infection, cases is reduced by about 85% and the 15% symptomatic are infectious. More seriously, additional infections are being spread by asymptomatic cases, preliminary research indicates that about 20% to 40% ( a wide range) of double vaccinated infected persons are infectious even though asymptomatic.
As the R number of the Delta variant is above 6 if there are no non-medical interventions e.g. social distancing  or mask wearing and no vaccinations but with vaccinations the R number may still be in the range of 3 to 4 giving strong exponential growth.
In winter conditions it will be necessary to reintroduce NMEs to protect the vulnerable e.g. cancer sufferers undergoing chemotherapy."

What the vaccine-resistant fail to understand is that as they dawdle to get the jab, the virus continues to circulate and will certainly mutate again. One highly respected Canadian epidemiologist posited that if we don't get this shut down quickly the 6th or 7th variant could render the current vaccine far less effective.

And then ... well, we start all over again.

2021-07-30 17:38:18,The study was not peered reviewed and was a very small study. This is why people don't trust the CDC. They are making policy not based on the best science.  They are trying to find studies that follow their narrative. None of us win with that science.
2021-07-30 17:28:30,"Covid-19, as with many new medical conditions are complex, particularly at the outset when information is limited.  However, too often the public has wanted simple, black & white answers and in response, the gov't has given them these types of answers implying that the answers are definitive when they are based on evolving knowledge of the virus.  In this regard, the gov't has been treating the American public in the same way they have over many years when discussing complex social/political issues.  It is past time for the gov't to treat all Americans as if they are able to understand the complexity of an issue, even if that may not be true. If the public needs more detailed information, guess what, they'll ask giving the gov't experts the chance to provide more nuanced information to increase understanding.  My message: treat voters as children and they will behave as children;  treat voters as adults and they will be more likely to behave as adults.  Provide the information we NEED to hear and not just what you think we want to hear."
2021-07-30 17:10:01,"Of note to me from this article is the following:  35,000 cases per week occurred from a population of 162 million vaccinated people.  Doing the math this indicates that vaccinations are 98% effective on a weekly basis from preventing infections.  My only question would be: Does this infection rate continue over time, such that in 10 weeks, we would expect 20% of those vaccinated to become infected?
Secondly the statement that the  delta variant viral load in infected cases is 1000 of times greater than in those infected with     other strains suggests to me that the delta variant is more efficient in its ability to infect and/or multiply in the targets cells of the body.  Hence we would suspect that these higher viral loads might cause more serious illnesses than past strains of covid.  Likewise, the higher viral loads would also suggest that infectious cases would emit higher concentrations of the virus in their breath, and thus be more infectious, assuming comparable viability in air."
2021-07-30 17:32:50,"I remember chickenpox. My grandchildren don't know what it is because it's been eradicated.  My children may not remember that they had it.

My son got it first and was hardly a problem.  But one of my charges had the worst case I've ever seen! Poor thing was miserable and it was a fight to get her through it.  
Covid Delta variant may spread like wildfire too but it's deadly.  We can't be flip about it!"
2021-07-30 16:31:37,"I have to wonder how many NYT commenters could be so widely and mutually afflicted by cognitive dissonance.

The central point of Apoorva Mandavilli's report is that CDC data shows infected, vaccinated people spreading the virus as well as the infected, unvaccinated.

But the most recommended comments are those that only beat the drum for more vaccinations and blow Bronx cheers at the unvaccinated.  

“… vaccinated people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant carry just as much virus in the nose and throat as unvaccinated people, and may spread it just as readily, if less often.”

How can anyone discount this alarming reversal of emphasis by CDC head Walensky?

From the link to WAPO: 

""Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, said he was struck by data showing that vaccinated people who became infected with Delta shed just as much virus as those who were not vaccinated. 

We've been tacitly believing the vaccines confer ""sterilizing immunity."" They don’t.

By glossing over this crucial detail, the vaccinated believe they cannot get infected, cannot transmit, and will be protected from all Covid symptoms. 

Wrong, wrong, and wrong.

But old mindsets die hard ... even among intelligent NYT readers.

This new data does not exactly put the country and the world back to square one, but it is a huge disappointment for sure.

We need to overcome our disbelief, then mask, distance and ventilate -- even the vaccinated."

2021-07-30 17:13:26,"Since it's so catchy, CDC, there' s no problem in sending unvaccinated children back to school in-person, lest they succumb to the ongoing horrors of online education?"
2021-07-30 17:40:13,"It was unfortunate that this CDC document was released without properly considering the consequences and without addressing other parameters that affect disease dynamics. 
Some of the conclusions were clearly intended to be internal. 

Delta declined very quickly after very brief spikes in India and the UK. UK new case numbers are down about 40% from peaks just 10 days ago; that’s unusual. I’ve not read any UK conclusions that it is more deadly; infectious yes. UK deaths per capita/per case have not yet spiked with the Delta expansion, nor did those in India. So far, new deaths/capita are similar in US and UK, even with UK’s Delta spike.

We are getting good results showing how effective the vaccines are and how few breakthroughs there are. Delta could change that but given that most new cases are unvaxxed folks, I don’t think so. 
All sources show the rate of breakthrough infection deaths is incredibly small compared to what we’ve seen from COVID.
VA, MD, IL, NJ and MA have all reported vaxxed breakthrough cases and deaths. Deaths/million ranged from 7 (for CDC info, i.e. 1,141 for 161 million vaxxed people) to a high of 26/million in IL.  

What if we had all been vaxxed a year ago? Even using Illinois’ high of 26/Million death rate, given our 330 million population, we would be seeing a very low COVID death toll of 8,600 versus 628,152 and counting. For perspective, flu death toll was during the bad season of 2017-18 (maybe 5 months), was 61,000."
2021-07-30 17:47:09,"I am struck by the enormous fraction of the U. S. population who think science is a belief system; namely, that what one believes has anything to do with whether or not one contracts a disease.  Molecules that transmit the Virus have no ability to read a person's mind.  Virus molecules have a probability of attaching themselves to molecules in the human body and in some cases if such molecules succeed in doing that, they might cause an infection that might ""poison"" that human body.  
Vaccines do not ""poison"" people.  Only the Virus molecules do.  The Vaccine induces antibodies in humans which greatly reduces the probability that a Virus molecule would attach to a person, which might ""poison"" that person.  In order to avoid being infected by the Virus, the most effective step one can take is to be vaccinated, which substantially reduces the probability of infection  - but does not totally eliminate the possibility of infection by the Virus. The goal of scientific research for vaccines is to find a vaccine that reduces the probability of infection to ever smaller numbers, which is the reason why everyone should be vaccinated.  People who are not vaccinated are much more likely to be infected by the Virus than people who are vaccinated.  This fact is demonstrated by the saying that this pandemic is a pandemic of the unvaccinated."

2021-07-30 18:05:21,"“…vaccinated people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant carry just as much virus in the nose and throat as unvaccinated people, and may spread it just as readily, if less often.”

So those with breakthrough infections are virus incubators just like the those who are infected but not vaccinated.  This is a devastating finding because it implies that the vaccines are not as effective at slowing the mutation rate as we originally hoped.  

Quashing the mutation rate has to be a top priority and if vaccines alone can’t accomplish this then more restrictive measures like lockdowns and quarantines are imperative."

We can only try to move forward with as much courage as we can muster."

The article talks about HOW MUCH IS STILL UNKNOWN about Covid. FWIW, I'm guessing that almost all talented, intelligent people at the CDC ""hung it up"" during Trump's tenure, and they're nowhere near ""world class"" yet - if they ever were or every will be.

There's actually another good op-ed, that calls for ""smartness,"" if/when masking up becomes more than the idea-of-the-day (yes, I mean that as a put-down) that it seems to be a/o 7/30/21.

The author(s) would have the CDC ""determine"" whether shopping or clubbing is ""higher risk"" ... and things like that.

Answers to questions like that WOULD be nice, but I'm not holding my breath. It's tough to do good experiments these days, and there's a definite tradeoff between getting results published sooner and QUALITY (reliability) of the findings.

“…Out of 161 million US residents who were fully vaccinated as of July 19, just 5,601 caught a severe breakthrough infection and were hospitalized — an infinitesimal 0.0035 percent of the protected population, according to the latest CDC figures available on post-vaccination infections…

“…When it comes to deaths, the risk is even lower, with just 1,141 vaccinated people dying from a COVID-19 breakthrough infection — or 0.0007 percent of those fully jabbed…

At each holiday, TV has practically applauded all the people getting on airplanes to bring any virus they don't yet know they have to other parts of the country. No matter how much virus is in the air, people crowd into indoor spaces with poor ventilation and revel in taking off their masks, if they even wore them on their way there. There are fantasies that we won't have to really accept any inconvenience because ""herd immunity"" will protect us -- even if much of ""the herd"" never did their part by wearing masks and getting free shots once available. Now there seems to be a fantasy that indoor spaces are somehow safe if people are vaccinated and wear masks. They aren't.

Unfortunately the population of unvaccinated  is so large it has allowed for the variant to become dominant. I am sure boosters designed to combat the Delta form will need to be taken. There will be a continued need to edit the vaccines to deal with new variants UNTIL vaccination is mandated for all who are able to get it.Vaccination is the only way to stop this deadly cycle.

2021-07-29 11:11:44,"This policy change will lead to the closure of many, many nursing homes.  As most patients are Medi Caid , the fees paid are much less than the actual costs,  leaving most homes on the edge of financial ruin.  The massive shortage of CNA's and the rising wages for these jobs, as well as kitchen and housekeeping jobs has made most homes money losers.  Plus with no workers available, and literally 100,000 rules to follow, homes need just the slightest nudge to close.  A large fine puts them over the cliff. Closing nursing homes will put the care of bed bound, demented, 100 medication a day,  unable to feed themselves or control their bowels or bladder, patients back to their families where they can get true quality care without the influence of 100,000 rules, or a scramble to pay the help and fines."
2021-07-29 11:55:00,"Enforcement of Federal Nursing Home regulations has been weak for many years. This is a significant step in the right direction but it won’t change the fact that many state survey agencies (SSAs; who contract with CMS to oversee and enforce the Federal regulations) are underfunded, understaffed, experience significant staff turnover, and have serious gaps in their ability to detect violations of regulations (such as neglect of healthcare) and hold nursing homes accountable.

I call it “Nested Neglect.” When CMS and SSAs are limited in their ability to ensure that nursing homes are in compliance with federal regulations (also called Requirements for Participation in the Medicare/Medicaid program), that is, basic standards of care and safety, in effect, the conditions are created for neglect and other forms of mistreatment of residents.

And if you think that this is bad, the elephant in the room is much worse. Assisted living residences (ALRs) are the fastest growing residential option for elders in this country and “dementia care” is the fastest growing segment within ALRs. Over 40% of ALR residents have a diagnosis of dementia and 70% have some level of cognitive impairment. Many residents have extensive need for assistance in activities of daily living (bathing and toileting) and many have complex health conditions.

Minimally regulated by states, for-profit ALRs are “flying under the radar without a black box” with minimal to no enforcement.

As a former hospital COO, I observed that the very worst problem was lack of staffing, and inadequately trained and directed staffing.  Watching staff run up and down the halls to answer call bells, watching my 92-year old, disoriented, roomate fall out of bed (her call bed hadn't been answered and she had to go to the bathroom) and break her pelvis - it was all shocking, and disheartening.

In 2013, PBS Frontline / ProPublica released a film called Life & Death in Assisted Living about the largest assisted living corporation in the country at the time: Emeritus. In it, deadly neglect of elders with dementia resulted in minimal fines. One resident, George McKAfee, who had dementia in assisted living in Georgia gained access to an unlocked bottle of industrial strength dishwashing liquid. He drank it, burned his lips, esophagus, and lungs, and died. The state, which found Emeritus negligent in his death, planned to find the assisted living $601 for it. In other tragic case in Colorado, a resident with dementia, Herbert Packard, was beaten by another resident. He suffered broken hip & brain bleeding. He died two months later. The fine? $500. Families were extremely upset by it. The daughter of McKAfee described the fine as ""outrageous"" and a ""slap on the wrist.""

A second issue is where is OSHA in this? Nursing Homes are workplaces. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is a special workplace situation in which the virus can be carried into and out of  the workplace by workers. Multiple employers failed to protect workers against disease and death. Furthermore it is well known that many Nursing homes employee to most vulnerable of workers, including recently immigrated Americans who are not knowledgeable of their legal rights to a safe and healthy workplace.
I'm therefore suggesting a double burden be placed on employers and owners who failed in their legal and moral responsibilities to protect patients and workers. Jail time  sets an example."

It will take more federal and state government oversight to ensure, at least, that all staff and residents get vaccinated. Facilities rated 1 or 2 (we know that even 5 star facilites sometimes don't deserve their ratings) need strict oversight to comply with higher standards, which is typically based on staffing. The number of nurses and aides, as well as their ability to deliver. I find it unexplainable that poorly rated homes stay that way, for many years, and/or they are sold, and the new owners keep promising, but don't deliver, improvements. Bottom line - inspectors aren't doing their job, and/or bribery is taking place. For those patients with family members, why aren't families raising the alarms on these poorly run places? There should be postings, scrutinized by the Medicare/Medicaid system, that allow residents and/or family members to personally offer their honest opinions, based on factual experience.

One would think the chair of the health committee would look into the how the facilities were run prior to covid, as he continued to daily ignore constituent letters.  Neighboring Yorktown, NY had a senior facility which sold a portion of their facility for $28 million. There were a shortage of hospital rooms, senior care and no oversight.  Privately owned facilities not caring for their patents, but cramming people in rooms to take advantage of their medicaid, medicare and other healthcare payments.

One night he fell and we were notified. I went to the facility and was in his bathroom about 10 p.m. I heard voices and when I came out of the bathroom I found someone drawing his blood without wearing gloves. As this is an OSHA violation, I asked the person what they were doing. He said the facility can not do blood draws and he was called by the facility. The person had long dirty fingernails. He had the security code to get in the building. I asked him how he knew he was in the right room since my father in law was not alert and could not identify himself. The phlebotomist could not even say how he knew he was drawing blood on the correct person. There was no RN required to be on duty. I reported this to the Dept of State Health Services and no sanctions were given. Needless to say, we moved my father in law. Turns out the private practice doctor was also on the payroll of the facility. Texas has no consumer protection laws or elder care protection.

And of the 469, how many are really ""sick"", that is to say, ""symptomatic"".  How many are hospitalized? Seems to be a missing element.  

If you have less than a 1% chance in one of the most potentially hazardous environments possible, and a 0% chance of hospitalization or dying are we confusing infection with illness?  What if we treated every illness that was detectable by amplifying text (PCR), but does not result in serious illness in almost 100% of the cases as grounds for masking, distancing, closing offices? What do we do with the 45m cases of the flu annually that fall into this category.

All because people will not get vaccinated.

And the question is why?   To stop the few breakthrough infections that occur?  Which 99.5 percent of the time do not cause serious illness or require hospitalization.

No.  Probably to protect those who cannot get vaccinated due to immunocompromised situations and to stop the next variant from coming along.

But.

The next several variants are coming regardless because of where global vaccination rates are.

And we can’t lock everything down again for the immuocompromised few although we should make as much accommodation as we can to keep them as safe as possible.

Otherwise.  Let the unvaccinated suffer through their own fourth wave and evolve their way off the earth.

My empathy is at its limit.  They had none for me from the very start of all this.  I locked down for 16 months, distanced, didn’t travel, or go out to eat, didn’t step foot in an office, watched friends with other medical conditions die because hospitals were to dangerous and treatment was delayed.  All to protect others and buy time for a vaccine.

And now that there is a vaccine these people don’t honor the sacrifice we all made, on essentially their behalf, and get vaccinated?  And they expect me to have any empathy left for them?

Who suggested vaccinated people were immune from being carriers? Who expected otherwise? I find the level of analysis on this topic poor. The reason for the mask mandate last week wasn’t so much because the vaccinated could get delta, it was because the vaccinated could carry delta to the vaccinated, yet that was barely mentioned. Instead the coverage was on the imposition it caused the vaccinated to wear a face mask. More scientific, fact based analysis please and less outrage and wishful thinking."

2021-07-30 17:42:54,"This evidence simply tells me it's a problem for those who are unvaccinated.

If I am vaccinated -- and barring a small number who  can't, sadly for health reasons, get themselves vaccinated -- why and how should I care? Especially when it seems highly likely that I may not even know I have it on me to spread?"
2021-07-30 17:43:49,"So, if what the CDC is saying about the Delta variant is true (stipulated for a moment) - that Delta has an R0 of 6-9 like chickenpox, even among vaccinated people - then simple cloth face coverings (as opposed to sealed respirators) used by vaccinated people without any other NPIs would seem to be next to useless. If there is such overriding concern and worry that this variant is super infectious and super-deadly, and vaccination doesn’t really stop the spread (even if it cuts symptomatic illness) - doesn’t that call for a strict return to extreme distancing, closures, and lockdowns? For a virus supposedly so virulent, if the concern is protecting the vulnerable at all costs, wearing a mask while walking 20 feet from a door to a dining table, and then eating maskless for an hour in a full capacity restaurant, will have next to zero protective effect. 

I say that somewhat rhetorically, because we all know stricter, lockdown-level NPIs would be politically and socially impossible to implement at this point, and would require such ferociously intense enforcement well beyond anything the country has the capacity or will to implement. 

But it strikes me as somewhat contradictory to publicly announce that the threat has increased dramatically, but suggest that the only additional intervention is to require already-low-risk vaccinated people to engage in a relatively futile step like wearing non-respirator masks among themselves."
2021-07-30 18:07:24,"So how is this new or concerning? We have always known that vaccination works on statistical basis. According to the studies done in Israel, vaccines provide more than 90 percent protection against a serious illness even if happen to get COVID. Of course, you can spread it to others. But if they are also vaccinated, they have the same protection as you do. And if they are not, it is on them. Yes, some tiny percentage of people will get a severe case of COVID even if they are vaccinated. And some tiny percentage of people die of flu every year. So what? People apparently cannot do a rational calculation of danger or any kind of risk assessment. If you can’t face the world where dangers lurk everywhere, you need a mental health checkup."

Perhaps, the worst possibility is when the virus infects the vaccinated, as the Delta variant does, and replicates in them, more potent breakthrough mutants will arise. To the unvaccinated: please get vaccinated asap. To the vaccinated: please do not let your guards down, wear masks and follow other measures so that you will not get infected and become a spreader."
2021-07-30 18:09:43,"“Breakthrough infections” are not rare. People infected with the “original variety COVID” can get reinfected after recovery. I know, I am one. I had COVID in March 2020 and recovered (a mild case) and tested positive again in July 2020 (another mild case but with the “long haul” syndrome this time).
No one understands this virus period. Everything that appears in mainstream media is shape and shadow, often with the accident of truth removed. No one can research and understand the infective process, mutation rate, mutation success, antibody/antigen reaction, neutralization effectiveness and rate, and more for a virus that came on the human stage less than 2 years ago. Polio virus, as stable as it is and with an extremely effective vaccine still has breakthrough infections; reports on possible booster vaccines for polio were discussed years ago along with reports on re-infection in those who previously had polio.
In all the reporting I have read, I rarely find the meat of the argument: namely the number of people included in a trial, the criteria and exclusion criteria for a trial, follow up research on antibody response and duration, and the number of people immunized who develop any positivity ( /-) symptoms.
I don’t think popular media must report COVID research news like a scientific journal but I do think it needs to include appropriate references to such publications, if the research is by companies making vaccines, and whether the info is peer reviewed. NYT is not JAMA."
2021-07-30 18:11:34,"Yeah, and if they spread it to anyone, it will be most likely to a person who chose to not get vaccinated, and if the person to whom they spread it happens to get very sick or die, that most likely will be because that person was unvaccinated.

2021-07-30 18:08:29,"""... rare breakthrough infections..'

Use of ""rare"" is very misleading.   In fact, vaccinated individuals exposed to an effective dose of the virus (one that would cause symptoms in an unvaccinated individual), have a five to 10% chance of becoming ill.   That's the meaning of having a vaccine that's 90 to 95% effective.   Such infections may be somewhat unusual, but there are certainly not RARE.   And it's critically important that the media be precise given previous failures reporting covid news."
2021-07-30 18:09:19,"Because even ""mild"" breakthrough cases may lead to long Covid, Here is some info on masks that can really protect the wearer.

All advanced counties produce an anti-viral masks (which are also called respirators), designed to protect health care workers in Covid ICUs.   

The N95, made in the US, are the only mask approved by the FDA.  The downside is the higher cost and discomfort.  Many people find them hard to breathe through.

Two other widely available masks are the KN95 and KF94.
The KN95 is made in China.  Until 7/1/2021 the FDA authorized some KN95s for use in health care settings in the USA, because of the shortage of N95.  This mask is less thick than the N95 and much easier to breathe through.  They are also a fraction of the cost.
The KF94 is made in South Korea and tested by their government.  It shares the advantages of the Chinese mask: easier to breathe through and less expensive.

I want to stress that all three masks have been battled-tested in Covid-care settings.  All three masks are sturdy and reusable in the light virus context of the supermarket.  If you regard your office as a heavy virus context, you can disinfect by placing the mask in a sealed paper bag for three days and then discarding after five uses.

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.
I think, therefore I mask."

2021-07-30 18:12:14,Is anyone getting tested for COVID these days? In my area testing rates have fallen exponentially since last winter. Would we find more infections if testing went back to near the levels in late 2020?
2021-07-30 18:02:25,"I'm sorry, but the real headlines should be how well the vaccines work to prevent serious illness and death - which seem to be miraculously well. Vaccinated individuals shouldn't need to mask up unless they are in areas of known immunocompromised people. Everyone else over 12 (with minimal exceptions) could be vaccinated right now, and younger children (again with minimal exceptions) appear not get very ill from the virus.  At this point, I think governments and vaccinated individuals should treat this like flu season.  However, vaccines should be mandated wherever possible in order to lessen the chances of new variants popping up."
2021-07-30 18:03:34,"I read this as the vaccinated can transmit as easily as the unvaccinated.  They can,yes, but what is the probability that they will?

2021-07-30 18:03:58,"What I appreciate about this article--& the NYT & CDC reports overall--is that they keep the variables, the questions, & the changes./developments in what is known visible in their true 'fluid' state.

It would more be comforting to have promises & assurances, but it is more useful to have the protean known information before us. Honest facts -- & honest acknowldgement when those facts change -- let people make decisions wisely.  Failure to accept thst status is why so many refuse vacvination. If you are used to absolute, unchanging 'truth,' facts are scary."
2021-07-30 18:05:44,"Sadly, it is just this kind of information that feeds into the resistance of those unwilling to be vaccinated. 

It's a question of...trust.

I am fully vaccinated, but honestly, based on my observations and information from reputable sources, I have little to no confidence - or trust - that we know what we're doing when it comes to this virus. 
 
Moreover, the fact that we as one of the leading nations of the world, did not recognize early on - and get into immediate action - that we needed to work in collaboration with all nations in order to stamp out the spread of the virus...is disconcerting at best, suspicious at worst; and I'm not a conspiracy theorist. 

it is common sense, surges in other parts of the world the past 16+ months will eventually directly impact our country, if only because these countries become the breeding ground of variants; we're seeing that now with the Delta variant.

The lack of transparency about this virus, and its origins, calls into question whether or not we are fighting a battle with the virus...or engaging in a war with truth and reality."
2021-07-30 18:09:09,"The likelihood of breakthrough infections has me somewhat mystified. The evidence presented here — a single event, involving less than 200 people, 74% of whom were vaccinated, and 3/4 of the vaccinated coming down with COVID— is certainly distressing. But to extrapolate that to a universal conclusion seems questionable. Yesterday, there were 71,000 new infections nationwide; how many of them were fully vaccinated, and with which vaccines?

That said, I’m not surprised that vaccinated people can infect others, even if they are asymptomatic. The nose routinely collects viruses through respiration; a sneeze could easily distribute them to others who are or are not vaccinated.

Yesterday, I read an interesting study of a nasal spray tested in ferrets and published in Science in March. Apparently 100% of the ferrets given the spray and exposed to COVID were completely free of the virus, while those receiving the placebo were infected. The spray only lasts 24 hours, but it is stable, long-lasting, does not need refrigeration and cheap (well, for now; wait until big pharma gets hold of it). That could be a game changer for non-western countries struggling with vaccines, or even fully vaccinated people worried about declining efficacy. What is the status of this research?

Of course, it’s a big jump from ferrets to humans. On second thought, given the political news these days, maybe not so large a chasm in some Americans."
2021-07-30 17:55:20,"""Even the vaccinated carry high virus levels if they become infected, the agency concluded, making it likely they can transmit the virus as often as the unvaccinated. If so, they may be contributing to increases in new infections — although probably to a far lesser degree than the unvaccinated.""

This is incredibly confusing wording. If an infected vaccinated person can spread the virus as much as an infected unvaccinated person, so be it. But the vaccine greatly reduces your chance of infection in the first place. So the vaccinated are not transmitting the virus ""as often as the unvaccinated."" Which is why the 2nd sentence is true, even though it seems to contradict the (inaccurate) first."
2021-07-30 18:02:32,"I'm not sure what's worse, the increase in covid infections or the messages coming out this week in the news from the CDC that are contradictory to the resolute messaging of earlier this summer about the efficacy of the vaccines.

The problem is they've created an ""I told you so"" moment for people that have questioned the usefulness of the vaccines and have not yet been vaccinated, and now very possibly will never be persuaded. 

By highlighting breakthrough infections, lowered vaccine effectiveness in the long term and saying we all need masks again checks all the boxes for anti-vaxxers.

Sure, a lot of earlier statements that were made by the CDC were predicated on the current covid strains at that time, but  many may not understand that and depending on where they get their news, that fact may never get stated."
2021-07-30 18:09:00,"We have 2 positive cases in our household - a young child and a vaccinated adult.  Child had a fever for 24 hours and has been fine since.  Vaccinated adult is asymptomatic (only tested because the child was, so why not?).  This is the most likely outcome - by far - for a vaccinated adult and young child.  Yet we now have to quarantine for a lengthy period of time and it's wildly disruptive.  Frustrating.  Vaccines basically made this a non-medical event, but we're still treating it like its April 2020."
2021-07-30 18:01:15,"The obvious course of action from these new changes is a top down federal approach, heavy handed in regulation because the public good is more important than our individual rights.   We should also use this opportunity to leverage this set back to pursue our political motivations that would otherwise be unpalatable if there were not a crisis.   Imagine the social engineering we can accomplish, like income and wealth distribution, to the expansion of the federal government and even voting right."
2021-07-30 18:04:36,"I don't understand :
""Vaccinated people with rare breakthrough cases""  
Whenever I read about a large group of people discovered to be positive for Covid-19, a large percentage (3/4 in this article) are vaccinated.  
That's not rare, it is a significant majority.
It has never been more important for the CDC to be accurate."
2021-07-30 18:10:52,"This is very confusing. The CDC has been incredibly non transparent and borderline negligent throughout the pandemic. They should have never encouraged an honor system for wearing masks. That just gave the green light for the unvaccinated to lie and take off their masks.  They also should have never stopped tracking mild or asymptomatic cases of breakthrough infections. How can we trust that breakthroughs are rare if they are not being tracked? Also, if breakthroughs are so incredibly rare, why is there concern about the virus being just as transmissible as unvaccinated cases? What about asymptomatic breakthrough cases?

I think the lesson here is that vaccinations alone are not a sufficient public health measure for containing the virus at this point. We must continue masking and social distancing indefinitely, since we're probably not ever reaching herd immunity."
2021-07-30 17:56:27,"Please fix your headline.  It's misleading based on what your own article claims.  ""Rarely"" involves a stronger claim than ""although probably to a far lesser degree than the unvaccinated.""  The fact is we don't know if the term ""rarely"" should be applied at this point.￼  Your own language hedges by using ""probably.""  Your headline doesn't. 

""Even the vaccinated carry high virus levels if they become infected, the agency concluded, making it likely they can transmit the virus as often as the unvaccinated. If so, they may be contributing to increases in new infections — although probably to a far lesser degree than the unvaccinated."""
2021-07-30 18:12:46,"This is hopeless, these anti-vaxers are never going to let us get on top of this virus and it's just going to keep mutating."
2021-07-30 17:33:40,"There doesn't appear to be any evidentiary reason for the ""though rarely"" qualifier. In fact, given that vaccinated people, ""if they become infected, the agency concluded, mak[e] it likely they can transmit the virus as often as the unvaccinated,"" it seems reasonable to assume that it is happening *more* than we think.

So far, it looks as though that these vaccines can provide meaningful protection for those most susceptible to severe illness. But the evidence is starting to lean in the direction that they provide no real societal benefit (because people can still spread the virus), thus emphasizing how personal a choice it is. 

Mandates were never going to be the right answer (not to mention probably illegal), but they make even less sense now."
2021-07-30 17:52:14,Comparatively rare? Its time to be honest here: in LA the percentage of positive cases that were breakthrough cases was 20% in June. In July it rose to 26%. The Provincetown and Barnstable outbreaks are a wake up call to start tracking this data.  By continuing to use descriptives like rare a false sense of protection is conveyed by the media and the CDC. This is misinformation because we do not know the true number of breakthrough cases based upon variable local and regional reporting. The CDC should have been following all breakthrough cases. That is how you keep the finger on the pulse of vaccine effectiveness.
2021-07-30 17:55:17,"It is very frustrating how little information the CDC will give to J&J recipients about potential mRNA boosters. If the CDC is waiting for more information from clinical trials, as most assume, it can certainly suggest people wait and see when there’s more evidence, but it is unreasonable to refuse current J&J recipients who would like to go get boosters while vials are wasting away on shelves. At the very least, it should acknowledge the open question more readily when it makes suggestions for “vaccinated” and “unvaccinated” groups, because millions of Americans are stuck constantly wondering how they fit into the overall picture.

I understand that public organizations are trying to balance a million things right now, but Delta’s rise was known in February, and people have been publicly asking about single-shot efficacy since at least April. The silence, by this point, is egregious."
2021-07-30 18:15:07,"I think they need to rethink their definition of “rare” , a word they like to throw around to avoid inciting panic. To me, rare would be more like one vaccinated person out of say 5,000 caught the delta variant.  High risk vaccinated people in my state have still caught and died from Delta."
2021-07-30 18:19:30,"The Massachusetts study shows that three quarters of the people infected in that outbreak were fully vaccinated. That’s not “rare” for breakthrough infections, by any definition of “rare”. The CDC needs to start talking about booster shots, pronto. Having fully vaccinated people spread around the virus is not an acceptable situation. We can’t really go back to full lockdowns either. The Pfeizer study shows that their booster shot provides a strong protection against the delta variant. I assume Moderna has something similar in the works. So be it. At this point we have to shift focus from the refuseniks back to those who are willing to be vaccinated and work with them. Of course, the situation is extremely messy but it cannot be helped."
2021-07-30 18:28:30,"We need to get as close to 100% of eligible Americans vaccinated, period. It should be mandated with whatever reasonable enforcement measures that can be devised; those will likely take the form of ""carrots and sticks"", no doubt. Resistance to the vaccine is not an option. Nor should it be.  Should we all resist polio shots? Do you want to be in an iron lung? Somehow it seems people are willing to believe AIDS and polio are real and to single mindedly without protest protect themselves from those, but they promulgate that COVID is a hoax.  Those people are being ridiculous. In the meantime everyone wears an N95 mask indoors. We'll beat down the virus.  The masks pre and post vaccine always predominantly served to contain respiratory sputum with viral load inside a knowingly or unknowingly infected person. The drops could then not fan out in aerosol, traveling through the air and land in the airways of an uninfected person, because they got trapped in the mask fabric when the infected person talked, coughed, laughed, sang karaoke or breathed.  They didn't fan out and diffuse and become more contagious. Then picture adding onto this majority ""why-masks?"" factor, some amount of complimentary, additive, protection against the possible incoming, aerosolized viral-sputum by wearing a mask. It hasn't changed post-vaccine as the authorities hoped and science informed, because the variant still causes infections in vaccinated people. Where there is infection there is transmission."
2021-07-30 18:25:40,"Part of the problem is the definition of ""breakthrough cases"".  Some have defined this as any vaccinated person who tests positive for the virus. Others have defined it as a vaccinated person who is suffering significant symptoms. 

The first seems to be relatively common and the latter pretty rare. 
How about the CDC and medical professionals agree on a definition so that vaccinated people can make an informed decision about their own risk?  

Seems to me the rationale for vaccinated people to wear masks is to protect the unvaccinated, who are unwilling to protect even themselves."
2021-07-30 18:17:25,"The truth is that little has changed substantially.  The load is higher, yes.  It spreads more easily, yes.  But the risks remain primarily in those who were most at risk before the variant -- namely, the unvaccinated and immunocompromised (of all ages)."
2021-07-30 18:15:48,"We have to start being more precise about the difference between ""breakthrough cases"" and ""breakthrough illness."" If breakthrough infections are occurring in large numbers in certain locations--whether with severe illness or not--they are not ""rare."" This distinction is especially important to those who have conditions, such as unsymptomatic CLL,  that leave them not knowing if their vaccination is actually protecting them against illness or not. This is a large number of people, not just a relatively small number of transplant patients and known ""immunocompromised."" And the CDC has got to get its messaging act together."
2021-07-30 18:16:10,"The data on vaccinated infections has not been recorded since May. The CDC announced there was no need to get a test if you had a breakthrough infection or symptoms after May. The only infections included in the data are the hospitalizations of those breakthrough cases. I would think the data of actual breakthrough cases, hospitalized or not, to be crucial in proceeding to implement ANY public policy. 
I am trying to remain hopeful but feel the CDC announcements may be influenced on the public reaction the day before."
2021-07-30 18:22:31,"It is a vaccine not a force field. You can take the virus onboard - then test positive, you can pass it on.

So far  the vaccines have been astonishingly successful in preventing major illness and allowing the world to move on. Eradication of the virus is   not going to happen nor was it ever the  goal."
2021-07-30 18:24:58,"This article fails to mention one very important factor. Of those infected who were fully vaccinated, how do the numbers compare between the populations vaccinated with the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines? The source of the vaccination is mentioned for a total of four vaccinated individuals who were hospitalized, but four is a very small sample, from which generalizations cannot be meaningfully made. What about the larger population of those infected, or the larger population of Provincetown?

As both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were reported to have much higher efficacy than the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when they were first introduced, this is an important question. Are they indeed more effective in preventing infection? I am surprised that the article does not address this question, even if all that can be said is that there wa no data addressing the question."
2021-07-30 18:12:51,This isn’t really a surprise.   The advice that it was okay for the vaccinated to remove masks was premature.  It was more about making people feel better than science.    My husband is dealing with co-workers at a local large university who ridicule him for continuing to wear a mask.  Even seemed to imply that he was a coward to not take his make off.    They keep stating that the pandemic is over and they want life to be normal again at any cost.   Not us- it’s not that hard to keep wearing masks and practice social distancing to keep all safe.   We all need to continue to have patience.
2021-07-30 18:28:58,"I think more analysis should be done into the specific circumstances of this Provincetown outbreak-- if it really was a lot of people in super packed indoor crowds, dancing at close quarters for many hours, I think that should be taken into account. Those aren't exactly everyday circumstances for most people."
2021-07-30 18:32:43,"I got a haircut at a hair salon a week ago.
I double masked so did my stylist, we both have little ones at home who aren’t able to get the vaccine. My husband and I mask when we go out and haven’t eaten at a restaurant since January 2020. Point is that those of us with little ones or are care takers to those who are immune compromised have to keep on masking.  To paraphrase the Simpsons  “do it for them”. Else this thing will mutate forever."
2021-07-30 18:33:31,"I had my doubts when the CDC recommended a few months ago that vaccinated people shed masks indoors. The honor system is a joke, and most unvaccinated are not wearing masks at all. There is no honor when people think it's OK not to be vaccinated. With freedom comes responsibility and getting vaccinated is a responsibility. There are a few exceptions, but most of the unvaccinated are irresponsible and lazy."
2021-07-30 18:34:45,"Please provide more information on the extent to which it helped people get the vaccine.  What % of those who got the vaccine had symptoms of COVID?  What % was hospitalized?  Did anyone who was vaccinated die?  How does this compare with the minority who got the virus and did not get the vaccine?

I fear in the absence of this information, it's hard to make the case that it's good to get vaccinated.

Are scientists convinced there was nothing unusual about the virus that infected people on Cape Cod?  It did contain the delta variant, but was there something else different about it?

This report is puzzling and concerning."
2021-07-30 17:39:45,"There is going to be a serious counter-surge of anger and probably more against these people who will not take the vaccine. They are paying the price by getting Covid, but we are paying the price by having Delta emerge as a threat.

I am angry, very angry, and I hope we can channel this energy into somehow tearing down false news outlets like Fox, etc. and re-educating people on facts, logic, and helpful government. We'll have to undo 30+ years of Republican efforts, but this is where the energy will be needed."
2021-07-30 18:22:51,"I am not scientist or a doctor, the CDC report is not something that is shocking the first thing I thought getting the vaccine was if I get covid19 , could be a carrier. Even warned my neighbors who are anti-vaxxers so I keep wearing my mask.
I understand scientists need actual proof and research but anybody with common sense should know this."
2021-07-30 18:41:49,"I’m dealing with a case of breakthrough covid right now. It’s no joke. I’m happy I got the vaccine (double jab Pfizer), because it would be much worse if I hadn’t."
2021-07-30 18:42:14,"Dog bites man. It is not the responsibility of the vaccinated to look out of the unvaccinated, anymore than it is the responsibility of drivers going the speed limit to look out for the 47% of people who die in auto accidents because they are not wearing seat belts. Vaccinations and/or being under age 30 protect enormously against bad cases of Covid-19, so vaxxed people can go back to living their lives. So can those who have had Covid-19 and generated immunity that way. Antibody tests can identify them. Telling these folks that they have to mask up is giving the message that vaccines do not work. Just stop it."
2021-07-30 18:42:18,"I'm struggling to understand how this supports the idea that unvaccinated individuals spread Covid. I have family on the East Coast - Provincetown is on Cape Cod and that region receives many visitors during the summer, especially during holiday weekends. It is not just as reasonable to assume that enough unvaccinated individuals spread covid to the vaccinated over the 4th and other weekends coming in from the Boston metro area? Is this causation or correlation? Genuinely curious if someone gathered more out of this article or has read more about this elsewhere."
2021-07-30 18:54:26,Seriously:  Did anyone really think everything about this virus was known?  I’m vaccinated and haven’t taken my masks off yet (when out in public).  Easy peasy - mask up everyone!
2021-07-30 19:00:46,"You know what would be nice? Some scientific data that tells us the R0 value for someone with natural immunity and/or immunized (broken down by brand).  I ain't no scientist, but I would think that would be good to know."
2021-07-30 19:08:26,"Make vaccination mandatory, it's a no brainer and Biden knows that too. The only thing holding him back is politics."
2021-07-30 18:51:19,"Did anybody think that getting together will all those other people in Providence were vaccinated??? This is not confusing Wear a Mask, Do Not Gather In Large Crowds, because you don't know if they have been around someone who wasn't vaccinated just walking by that person shopping in Target or Walmart or Nordstrom  etc. So many ways, if you get vaccinated at least you wouldn't be DEAD."
2021-07-30 18:57:00,"How sad. So one vaccine seems to be insufficient and soon I will be asked to take yet another vaccine (“booster”)  to prevent transmission. 

I get it that science doesn’t get it right the first time, but rushing out vaccines that do not do the complete job? 

Not interested in emergency use authorizations. Full review and study by the FDA please."
2021-07-30 19:01:18,"The real problem is the indication that even if we vaccinate the entire world tomorrow wit existing vaccines that will not deny the virus of a reservoir to mutate and, eventually and potentially, defeat the vaccine protection. Think about that."
2021-07-30 19:07:39,"For all those who seem to be confused about what the CDC is saying about ""breakthrough"" cases, here is an explanation in laymen's terms:

If you don't want to become sick with Covid, don't marinate yourself in the virus.  Vaccine or no vaccine."
2021-07-30 19:08:09,"I am fully vaccinated. I've been doing exactly the same when going inside anywhere as I've been doing since March '21: double mask, with washable filters. Staying away from close contact.....

Doesn't bother me a bit (no more than wearing tops and bottoms no matter how hot/humid the temperature...), and I expect to do the same for the foreseeable future."
2021-07-30 18:50:20,"Vaccination is clearly beneficial, but the problem here is that the vaccinated, according to this CDC report can be harbouring the Delta variant with a viral load, which then goes on to infect other people including other vaccinated people. This is very concerning if people are asymptomatic and can be unwittingly spreading this virus to the vulnerable and young children who are unvaccinated.

The Delta variant is highly transmissible and  this article demonstrates that there is still a need for a great deal of caution. 
The US has also vaccinated the population with more protective Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
The CDC caution is not replicated in the UK where the Johnson government is getting even more frenzied in declaring freedom from this deadly Delta variant, by pronouncing that all quarantine restrictions are to be lifted from double vaccinated travellers from Europe, (except France )and the US in August. The positive tests are still vacillating, and are today down to 29,622 from yesterdays over 31,000 positive tests. There are  almost 6,000 patients in hospital and 68 people have died.
This third wave in  the UK is not over yet and is highly unpredictable.
It is notable in the UK that the CDC guidance has not been reported, because it does not fit with the Johnson governments narrative to lift every safeguard for pure ideological reasons, whatever the cost to the UK population."
2021-07-30 18:54:07,"I was vaccinated with Pfizer in March and April in the US.  I came to France where I work and we are required to go into the office and wear masks in common areas and when meeting with others. Fully vaccinated, I relaxed and began wearing a surgical mask only.  Last week, I began feeling like a cold was coming on, sore throat, runny nose, headache and low fever.  Fearing the Delta variant, I got tested and sure enough, it was positive for the Delta variant L4252R. The day before I began feeling sick, I had been in a three hour meeting (don't ask) with all fully vaccinated colleagues and all wearing masks. As soon as I started feeling sick I began wearing a KN95 or N95 mask at home.  My spouse did the  same and I stayed in separate rooms and we each wore masks whenever we were in the same room maintaining distances and keeping windows open.  Over a week later I am fully recovered, I felt bad for about 3 days, and all of  my colleagues and my husband tested negative seven days after being exposed to me.  This tells me that masks help the virus from spreading among vaccinated people, but somehow the surgical masks did not help me in contracting the Delta variant."
2021-07-30 18:55:45,"Very rarely does a public-health intervention wind up being widely accepted without some kind of enforcement mechanism.
  The use of vehicle seat belts first arrived in the US as a recommendation and then it became a law. Eventually, police began fining those who were non-compliant, and buckling up became the norm, so with masks."
2021-07-30 19:02:34,"I’ve begun wearing my mask in indoor places again (I am vaccinated). This is just easier to do, rather than stopping to check transmission rates in my county and the adjoining ones, every time I go out."
2021-07-30 19:03:42,"I traveled to GA on a family matter last week.  Five days.  Four flights.  Airplanes packed to the gills, including middle seats.  Packed TSA lines with a 1.5 hour wait in Atlanta.  Two hour wait for a rental car in Atlanta.  Two hour layover at the Nashville airport where barely a third of people bothered to wear masks before boarding planes.

So, though I am fully vaccinated and I double-masked during every aspect of my travel and in any stores I visited, when I returned home to my state (which has a very high vaccination rate), I waited three days, stayed away from others, and then got a COVID test.  Fortunately, the test was negative--no active infection.  Hopefully that means I'm not a Delta variant carrier.  But given the news that keeps spilling out about it, who can know for sure?

A close relative in GA insisted that she felt like a ""tool of the government"" because of mask mandates (which have been few and far between in her state).  That is the mindset that plagues our whole nation.  Putin must be thrilled."
2021-07-30 18:45:46,"This is why I - fully vaccinated since the end of April - will continue to avoid attending events or participating in activities with those unvaccinated, indoors or outdoors, unless absolutely necessary.  And I continue to wear a mask when I do.

I have eaten indoors at a restaurant 5 times since mid-May.  That will now end for me unless dining is limited to only those vaccinated.

And my return to the gym - even with wearing a mask - also will soon end.

As I’ve commented before, we’re only in the bottom of the 5th/top of the 6th inning of a 9-inning baseball game.  We still have a long way to go."
2021-07-30 18:44:44,"As a parent, it would be really nice if the vaccine for children 12 and under could be made available by the early Fall.  If the Delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox, then every child is going to get infected at school or daycare or trips to the grocery store with their parents barring significant compliance with masks and social distancing (unlikely in the US)."
2021-07-30 18:59:03,"One again, we need to acknowledge that so-called “experts”, aren’t really."
2021-07-30 18:36:44,"No matter what we do, I now think that nature always find a way to beat human initiatives. In other words, this virus will keep on spreading and we will have to live with it. The only solution is to get vaccinated. This is the only meaningful thing most of us can do.

As for those who don’t get vaccinated, they should understand that they are risking their lives. I no longer have any form of empathy for people who choose to go unvaccinated and get very sick or die from this virus. Knowing all that we know, refusing the vaccine is, at best, immature. Decency prohibits me from writing what I really think of « anti-vaxxers ». Sorry if this sounds heartless."
2021-07-30 18:42:15,"I have supported the doctors and leaders telling us what to do except remove my mask after I got fully vaccinated. There was absolutely no reason for double vaccinated people to remove their masks. Why couldn't they be asymptomatic carriers?   Now with the Delta variant, one needs only a smaller dose to infect others.  I would not put away my mask until the pandemic is under control.  Even then who know...?"
2021-07-30 19:17:43,"“Vaccines are like hip waders,” Dr. Rasmussen said. “They keep you dry if you wade through a river, but get too deep and water will start pouring in over the top. That seems to be what happened in the Massachusetts outbreak.”

My question: Is passing through security at six airports and taking four flights on a round-trip from the West to the East getting ""too deep""? I'm vaccinated, but the lack of social distancing in the airports and having to occupy the middle seat on one flight is making me very nervous."
2021-07-30 19:20:44,"The longer the poor nations go without vaccinations, not to mention within the U.S., it's probably just a matter of time with additional mutations that breakthroughs will become more deadly."
2021-07-30 19:12:02,"Covid-19 to people of planet Earth:  it’s a pandemic. A turbocharged one.

It took only about 15 months for this coronavirus to mutate from alpha (China), to beta (South Africa and UK), to delta (India), largely because vast swaths of the world remain unvaccinated, therefore a breeding ground for rapidly evolving lethal variants. In the process the virus turbocharged to being 1,000x more transmissible, resulting in 200 million infected and 4.5 million dead worldwide.

Most of the world is likely to remain unvaccinated and vulnerable for some considerable period of time, predominantly in heavily populated poor countries with highly inadequate public health standards. 

There probably are mathematical equations that could predict what’s to come over the next 15 months, the next 30 months. Could future variants be 20,000x more transmissible, with more than tenfold in worldwide cumulative deaths?

I’m glad an optimist like Biden is in charge in the US, because the alternative is too gruesome to contemplate."

People seem to be stuck in this mentality of ""beating COVID"" as if we could ever defeat it entirely. We will all be exposed to it in our life times. Eradication is not possible. Let that sink in because it is our reality.

Luckily for us the vaccines make it so that exposure in the vast majority of cases is not life threatening, much like the other countless diseases we may encounter day to day. This is an important realization we all need to make because we can't indefinitely upend society for something that will never go away."

The article lumps vaccinated and unvaccinated into one pile with the caviat the the unvaccinated are probably larger spreaders than the vaccinated.

My feeling is that vaccinations should be required for healthcare workers unless they have some serious health condition and in that case they get tested weekly. The weekly testing alternative should be restricted.  Same thing for government and company employees, students, airplane travelers, bus riders,  etc.  While it's appealing to charge the unvaccinated for their health care if hospitalized, I don't think that idea will fly...... But basically, the idea should be to allow full participation in the world if vaccinated and to restrict others who haven't been."

Nor does 74% of those in the Provincetown bubble being fully immunized. That's not ""rare"".

Sentence #2: The vaccines remain powerfully effective against severe illness and death, and infections in vaccinated people are thought to be comparatively rare. 

I completely agree that it's potentially alarming that vaccinated individuals who have ""breakthrough"" infections carry the same amount of viral load as unvaccinated individuals, but this article doesn't help me to understand how alarmed I should be because it doesn't report the chance of a vaccinated individual having a breakthrough infection. What does ""comparatively rare"" mean? And is it equally comparatively rare for all 3 vaccines, or does one of them prevent breakthrough infections better than another? And for heavens sake, at this point why is it ""thought"", rather than known, to be comparatively rare? With millions upon millions of people already vaccinated and high stakes interest in whether these vaccines are effective or not, it's hard to believe that we don't know the answer to these questions."

delta is definitely more contagious than alpha. and the cdc hasnt done lots of research on the mild breakthrough cases."

It’s been said that our conventional vaccines are very good at protecting your internal organs from getting infected, and that’s essential, but they don’t trigger a lesser known portion that’s known as surface immunity. This has its own type of antibodies (IgA) along with a cellular component. That means outward facing mucosal surfaces aren’t necessarily protected by injected vaccines as opposed to naturally acquired infections. And given the highly infectious Delta virus that also leads to high titers of infectious virus, it’s not too surprising that some immunized people can become infectious via their mucus membranes. 

Interestingly, the oral polio vaccine provided highly effective enteric protection but was a live attenuated virus with a tiny chance of reverting to a paralytic form. In the West it’s largely been replaced by an inactivated injectable vaccine. 

Anyway, while modern medicine has made amazing strides, there’s still a lot to learn. And that goes double or triple for brand new infections."
2021-07-30 17:39:24,"This article has so many contradictions in it. It starts by saying, “fully immunized people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant may spread the virus to others just as easily as unvaccinated people,” and then right after that says they rarely do. Does that means unvaccinated people also rarely pass it on, even though somehow Delta is 10x more transmissible and that 1,000 times as much virus hangs out in our noses and throats as the original coronavirus?? 

Which is it? Do vaccinated people transmit it as easily as unvaccinated people, or do they rarely? The CDC cannot have it both ways. 

Please be clear."

Most experts felt we as a country would be coming out of this awful nightmare by now,  Instead, whether it's someone who doesn't know what to think after all the Trump and Republican lies about Covid-19 or those who simply refuse to be vaccinated out of some  tribal devotion to the comb-over tyrant, we're all at great risk.

Were we able to provide these people with a place ""to hang"" until the rest of us are safe from serious the effects of Covid-19,  like a Lake at Ozarks experience for the Dumb and Dumber who play Russian Roulette with their own lives  and are unconcerned about the adults and children they would needlessly  expose to almost certain death., I'd be all for it.

2021-07-30 20:15:45,"This is probably going to be an unpopular comment, but the CDC is not just for the scientific study of disease, but as their name indicates, it’s purpose is also for control & prevention. 

If the director of the CDC had issued a policy applicable to the majority of the United States general public a couple months ago, rather than a specific “no mask needed indoors” policy for those strictly vaccinated, then we would not be here with “giant” revelations of contagion spreading asymptomatically and turning on mask wearing for hot spots. 

The policy, and I’ve written this before because it’s based on the science The NY Times has reported, should have been “No masking needed outdoors!” Yeah! And then slowly looking at the data where sufficient vaccination has taken place to create “cluster reopenings” with masking indoor unnecessary specific to the numbers, not the other way around. 

I fail to see how these knee-jerk revelations of the latest data without proper time for analysis and interpretation into a broader policy are serving the public good. They are not. Data should be analyzed not just for its snapshot view over a particular moment in time, but its wave form view over extended time. We’ve all seen changes in this pandemic every couple of months affecting policy. That a variant is here is truly no surprise to many of us who’ve been paying attention. Such better declarations could have been made just two months ago and today’s approach would already be prepared."
2021-07-30 20:26:13,"When will Ms. Mandavilli or some other reporter look the facts square in the face and report what they see?   This is pretty simple, even though unpalatable. The vaccine is failing to do what it was supposed to do, which is to prevent people from getting Covid. The argument that  it protects against serious disease or death is specious (today's Boston Globe for an example of a vaccinated person's death from Covid). Since Covid only causes serious hospitalization illness or death in 1 percent of cases, the question is: what percent of vaccinated people who get Covid are hospitalized or die?"
2021-07-30 20:32:57,"Anyone who's a fan of slasher movies (or sci-fi variants like ""Alien"") knows that when the monster is slain - it's really not. It always re-animates and comes back to kill again.

So two months ago when the CDC told all of us who were fully-vaccinated that we could safely shed our masks and return to normal life (and the ""honor system"" was a preordained joke) - we all should have instinctively understood that this was insanely premature. It was a foolish decision that I suspect was made under intense pressure by Covid deniers in government and the business community - who were more concerned about stock prices and ""owning the Libs"" than public health.

How many times (what is this, the fourth wave now?) do we have to go through this ""false dawn"" before we learn our lesson? A sustained, coordinated and all-out campaign of universal masking, targeted lockdowns and mandatory vaccines (with as many new mRNA formulations as necessary) is the only way (if we're lucky) that we'll beat this thing.

If we continue to rely on half measures and premature relaxations, we'll be granting the virus enough breathing room to continue to randomly mutate until it stumbles upon a true Black Death variant. 

An apocalypse of that scale is beyond the imagination of even Hollywood. The survivors may well envy the dead."
2021-07-30 20:36:16,"All the people out there who clamor ""follow the science"" should be heartened by the ever-political CDC issuing this information about spread of the virus by vaccinated persons. 

the CDC  disserves the public by using this strict ""follow the science"" approach.

Ignoring the science is always foolish.  But strict ""follow the science"" is also sometimes unwise.  It means you are always at least 2 steps behind doing what is wise to do (first step is delay until a possible cause of a problem is suspected, second step is waiting until research determines whether the suspicion is correct).

A much better approach is to take action instead of waiting for data, BUT ONLY IF THERE IS MINIMAL COST IF THE ACTION TURNS OUT INEFFECTIVE.

That is the case with masks.  A mask is an article of clothing.  No one protests the requirement that people wear clothes over genital parts of the body even though there is no physical harm to anyone from people being naked.  Requiring mask wearing is just requiring clothing over another part of the body, and that requirement is only temporary until this pandemic is defeated.

Mask wearing requirements should never have been lifted, and should now be restored without waiting for data."

2021-07-30 20:37:23,"Vaccinated people clear the virus faster than the unvaccinated and spread the virus for a shorter time after been previously fully immunized. As we learn more from the 161 million people (or 49.4% of the US population) the C.D.C. is learning more about vaccinated people and there are quite a few who do not elicit a robust immune response which could be inadequate to prevent spread for a longer period. What is worse is some do not elicit any antibody response, either because they have an inherent inability to mount an immune response or are immunosuppressed due to any of the triple immunosuppressives that eliminates generation of any immune response. That is why Israel is now giving an option to those who do not develop an immune response to get a 3rd Pfizer dose.

Recent data suggest that those warriors/survivors of severe COVID among the 33+ million in the USA or 186+ million in the entire world could be eliciting a robust immune response that is superiorly broad and longer lasting and most likely to protect against not only the current variants of the original COVID but also any new future variants, that may evade the immune response from vaccines and render the first generation of the current Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, AZ, Sputnik-V, SinoVac and CoVac impotent to develop protective immunity.

Therefore it is critical to follow up long term the quality and quantity of the Immunity to COVID and its variants, following severe COVID infection. An approach to do that is developed."
2021-07-30 20:42:56,"Americans still for the most part don’t understand that the only way the pandemic ends is by making the lines of transmission end. Period. Whether that is through quarantine, lockdown, masks, vaccines, contact tracing and isolation the virus will continue to roam and mutate as long as we continue to provide it with hosts. End the lines of transmission and let’s put this thing to bed."
2021-07-30 20:21:22,"""In yet another unexpected and unwelcome twist in the pandemic, fully immunized people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant may spread the virus to others just as easily as unvaccinated people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report published on Friday.
The vaccines remain powerfully effective against severe illness and death, and infections in vaccinated people are thought to be comparatively rare. But the revelation follows a series of other findings this week about the Delta variant, all of which have upended scientists’ understanding of the coronavirus.""

First of all, months into the pandemic this doesn't ""upend"" even the understanding that non-scientists like me have of the coronavirus.

Second, when will the government recommend booster shots, especially for those of us who bought the guidance to take the first vaccine available ... even when that vaccine was the Janssen vaccine with its much lower efficacy? 

Third, will the CDC acknowledge that avoiding hospitalization and death *isn't* the gold standard for a vaccine? 

Fourth, there is a surplus of vaccines in the US, yet other countries only have vaccines for a small percentage of their people. I would send all of the J&J vaccines to countries and regions where two-dose vaccines are impractical. This includes countries without the means to refrigerate the more efficacious mRNA vaccines, and regions where people refuse two doses because it's inconvenient."
2021-07-30 20:22:01,"I remember last Spring when some were estimating this to be a 2-3 year event, particularly with the virus coming back stronger in the Fall/Winter. It seems like that analysis was right on the money. 

Also, hopefully the CDC can tell us before its too late whether a booster dose will be beneficial. We already know J&J is not as good as the other two. How many more people need to get breakthrough infections before we found out we need an additional dose?"
2021-07-30 20:31:30,"Perhaps the Federal Government could put a tax on people that are not vaccinated. That way, the people who are causing the greatest burden on society can help pay for it.  I always hear ""Freedom isn't free"""

Back in May, the science over there was saying to reinstate the mask mandate because Delta was spreading and over 60 percent of the population was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. A few days ago, the news out of Israel was recommending Pfizer booster shots so I expect the cdc to recommend that by September. The issue is the cdc should not have recommended that masks be removed knowing full well about the delta variant because now everyone is walking around without a mask indoors and many of those people are not vaccinated. I kept my mask on indoors and I am fully vaccinated. This virus is not going away any time soon. People are going to have to stop playing politics and start using some common sense and listening to the science instead of their Facebook feeds."

Three days later, my husband and I started getting possible COVID-19 Delta symptoms, quite mild. So we're awaiting the results.

If they're positive, we'll self-isolate, cancelling the first week-long vacation we've ever had. One we saved for a very long time. We're old. We have comorbidities. We could get very ill.

Yes, we should've demanded that he wear a mask. But he was with my husband in the garage, with the door open!

Problem is, Delta excels at spreading like wildfire, even in relatively open spaces. The original versions of the virus got their chance to morph into Delta thanks to the GOP's determination to trick people into refusing vaccination.

2021-07-30 21:41:17,"The confusion about the advice is feeding the anti-vaxxers’ point of view, which makes those of us who vaccinated even more anxious.  We all know that beating Covid is not an exact science.  All one has to do is watch the current CDC director closely every time she delivers a televised comment; she is hewing to a strict painstakingly crafted PowerPoint deck and/or teleprompter feeding her the word salad of the day - or the hour.  Her brow is furrowed, her look is pained - and painful to watch.  As a former corporate PR person, I am alternately fascinated and astounded at all the references to “miscommunications” or the “communications problems” with what she has advised and how she delivers her recommendations.  She does not inspire confidence, nor trust in her competence.  She should be kept behind the scenes, not in front of the camera where anti-vaxxers can sense her fear and uncertainty, and those of us who are vaccinated are even more fearful and angry every time she shows up in the media and gives ballast to the deniers."
2021-07-30 20:54:09,"The CDC is culpable in this mess. While people were dying in India, with less than half the US population vaccinated, they told vaccinated people in the USA to go maskless. This was basically an invitation for the entire country to do the same, since there is a group of people who never wanted to get vaccinated, and never wanted to wear masks who saw this as an opportunity to live the lives they always wanted to live. Now, they're acting surprised that this is happening. Why are they surprised? They had no data on how the vaccines would hold up to the delta variant. Additionally, they knew that the delta variant was already circulating in the US, but they were willing to risk the unvaccinated (which includes children and the medically comprised) for political reasons. I lost confidence in the CDC a long time ago. It's too bad that this is the organization we need to depend on for health guidelines."
2021-07-30 21:49:55,"Vaccines are exceptionally successful at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death from all variants of COVID. How much more dangerous is this virus for the vaccinated than the flu? It’s perfectly understandable to be afraid after the year we’ve all had, but a little perspective is in order. The vaccinated are safe. 

As for the unvaccinated; I believe in personal responsibility. Those of us who chose to get the vaccine weighed the risk of possible side effects from a novel MRNA technology against the known side effects of this virus. I think we made the right decision. But I’m not so arrogant as to say that I know 100%. And I certainly respect the right of people to reach a different conclusion. At the end of the day, their decision is their own, and it does not put us at great risk. Because the vaccine works."
2021-07-30 21:06:49,"A lot of comments suggest that the J&J vaccine is not as effective as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Seems to me this is a simplification, and may or may not prove to be correct once there is more testing of different vaccine regimens.

The J&J vaccine was tested and approved for a single dose protocol.  I don't know if it has been tested in a two dose regimen.  The emergency FDA approval is for a single dose.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, on the other hand, were tested and are approved for two dose regimens.

The approved one dose regimen of the J&J vaccine is indeed less effective than the two dose regimens of Moderna and Pfizer.  But we don't have complete data on how effective a two-dose regimen of J&J might be, and the FDA has not given emergency approval for a two dose regimen.

There are other questions that are also unanswered: how long does the immunity provided by the different vaccines last, how much protection against variants are they likely to provide, and what are the side effects of the various vaccines.

Finally, though there are 3 vaccines with emergency approval in  the US, there are many more available worldwide."
2021-07-30 21:36:03,"How about unvaccinated, unmasked children? I live in a high transmission area, where masks are still mandatory for unvaccinated people and are now once again recommended for vaccinated people.  In stores, I see few people wearing masks. Included in the unmasked are many school-age kids under 12 shopping with their  parents.  The children are obviously too young to be vaccinated, but their parents aren't having them wear masks, even though it's mandatory for them.  (Sometimes the unmasked kids even have coughs, which, being kids, they do straight into the air. )

I guess it'd be problematic for stores to single out kids and demand they mask, since they're the only people who can be visibly identified as unvaccinated. But, since we're long past the days when kids were thought not to catch nor pass the virus, this points to a bigger problem. If unvaccinated kids aren't masking, we can assume plenty of unvaccinated adults probably aren't either. All of which increases the level of Delta flying around in the air, and that endangers everyone. The masking honor system does not work."

Bottom line:  don't believe the hype.  The vaccine will keep you from the hospital, but it doesn't shield you from getting the virus, or, more importantly, from passing it on to others.

-- I realize that the numbers might not be complete, but if there were 469 cases out of 60,000 revelers in Provincetown, that means that 99.3 percent were not infected. The fact that only 5 were hospitalized makes me feel even better about the effectiveness of the vaccines.
-- Is it a surprise that vaccinated people who are infected (their vaccine failed) can  spread the virus? I'm not surprised by this.
-- What is the nature of this ""internal document"" obtained by the NYT that was ""published"" today? It reminds me of the terrorist assessments coming out of our national security agencies. Analysts are writing them all the time, but not all of them are taken seriously.  
-- Who is questioning the return to offices and schools this fall? Who is suggesting that unmasked family gatherings are off the table? These speculations are entirely unattributed. The report just came out today, and by ""came out"" we mean leaked. There's been no announcement by the CDC, nor any officials saying that it calls into question any of the scenarios that the writer calls into question."
2021-07-30 20:15:41,"The CDC recommendations for mask wearing are appropriate and should be followed.  Masks may be inconvenient and mildly uncomfortable, but this is a small price to pay for safety.  The strongest recommendation applies to ""public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission.""

It's reasonable to ask whether some behaviors are more concerning than others.  For example, the major impetus for the recommendations is described in an article in the CDC's publication, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, link below.

The lead article focuses on an outbreak in Provincetown, Mass, involving 469 cases.  The outbreak seems to be centered at events with what seem to be social partying; the article notes the events involved ""densely packed indoor and outdoor events at venues that included bars, restaurants, guest houses, and rental homes""; the ""demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants...""

It's prudent to wear masks.  It's probably also prudent to avoid events more likely to spread the disease.  The article also demonstrates that vaccines do not offer complete protection.  But, it's now very clear they help a great deal, and dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization and death.  All adults without medical contraindications should be fully vaccinated.

2021-07-30 22:51:34,"Folks who have gotten the vaccine (like myself) grant credence to the prevailing opinion of medical professionals that they're overwhelmingly safe and effective in preventing Covid 19- an infection that in most cases is asymptomatic or mild, but in some cases can be very severe. (The same is true of the polio virus, for what it's worth.) We realize that the protection is not 100%- for single-strand RNA viruses, 100% is a high bar.  We think that the fastest way to get to herd immunity is to have at least 3/4 of the population vaccinated, quickly, before the virus spreads and mutates into a more resistant- and possibly more serious- form. A goal that may be slipping away as of the time of this post. 

The people who refuse to get the vaccine have concluded that the risks of the vaccine are worse than the risk of severe Covid 19 infection. Most of the skeptics hold the view that dangers from contracting the virus have been wildly- even suspiciously- exaggerated, and that in any case the epidemic will eventually be effectively contained by the development of natural herd immunity.  

So here we are. The epidemiological experiment continues. We have a vaccinated population and a control population- roughly correlated by geographic region, to boot. 

By the Spring of 2022- two years into the epidemic, one year without widespread public access to vaccines and one year with it- we should have a clear-cut answer as to which position on vaccines is the correct one."

From the original report of the virus from Wuhan, and the previous research done by Shi Zhenglhi on similar viruses, we had every reason to expect the virus to mutate into strains that could (- most don't, but some could) become more contagious and/or harmful.

The USA ""reopened"" with a kind of recklessness necessitating that we all just forget about what's happening in the rest of the world.  That's never a good strategy.  Some in the public media like Thom Hartmann (who has the #1 progressive radio show supposedly) have been really calling this out for awhile, warning us that we are discounting the risks of the variants too much, even before the recent surge."
2021-07-30 23:03:10,"So do the vaccines work or not - and for how long. It would be helpful if the FDA would formally approve the vaccines.  The FDA needs to speed things up - there is plenty of data in Israel.  And, communication needs to be greatly improved- I personally have lost track of who or what organization is the formal Covid communication platform.  It’s like all of the former “experts” have all headed for the bunkers.  Leadership is severely lacking here."
2021-07-30 22:49:55,The smartest thing everyone can do is to not let yourself fall into the vaccinated-against-unvaccinated trap. Fighting each other won't help. Wearing a mask will.
2021-07-30 22:47:18,"I'm afraid the problem is much more serious than half the country simply not choosing vaccination for reasons of freedom, personal rights, fear of chips being implanted, etc. I think fundamentally, a sizable contingent of human beings are operating with slower and less optimal processing speeds, i.e., the brain, itself, is flawed. And less higher brain function means more emotional, illogical, and destructive belief systems are in play. How else to explain such absurdly ignorant behavior? Terribly cynical, I know, but I fear this must be the real source of the problem."
2021-07-30 20:25:40,"We can get closer to the nirvana of no-masks with everyone being vaccinated. That means though we may get a variant arising to a transmission, possibly to an infection, we have a huge benefit of it unlikely arising to a morbid or mortal disease.
And by that point, they'll have other variant-lock-and-key-fitting booster vaccines which DO smash infection.

3 steps in the viral assault cascade that I've seen made clear NOWHERE:

1) Innoculation- the virus enters our body. If it's out there on whatever vector, this happens irrespective of anything. It will get in if it can.

2) Infection. The virus once in and incubating for a while, effectively hijacks our cells' genetic machinery and reproduces itself to a certain level.  The is the  virus proliferating.  It's also the rung where it has proliferated enough that we may transmit it to others by natural vectors- coughing, respiratory droplets etc. Normally if the vaccine is an exact lock-and-key fit for the prevalent strain, this is staved off. It doesn't happen. Irrespective of this, we still don't get the worst of the disease, as we quite likely would have without vaccine.

3) Disease.  The viral infection interferes with body normal physiology. And this can range from ""asymptomatic"" to completely mordbid or mortal. A first general vaccine smashes down the acute and severe. A tailored booster eradicates it. Guess what refusing a vaccine doesn- Ahhh, dahhhh - enflames it and makes it much more possible????"
2021-07-30 20:30:16,"There are no longer any segments of the US population that have unequal access to the vaccine. Pharmacies are open 7 days each week, the vaccine is free, and everyone has at least one day off each week. Employer mandates are the answer.  The US needs to follow Israel’s lead, and authorize booster vaccines immediately for all those over 60 (not 65) for people vaccinated 6 months ago. The Israelis already did this for immune compromised people, with zero booster illnesses or complications, so that is plenty of data right there. Moderna recipients should be eligible to receive a Pfizer shot as a booster. The US response to the virus has always been 6 months behind the virus, and the CDC needs to stop wringing it’s hands, asking “what do we do now” when the Israeli data is in plain sight. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner has endorsed boosters, and he is the best authority the US has. If Americans want booster shots, they have been proven safe in Israel, so let individuals make the choice."
2021-07-30 19:35:42,"I, personally, know of three fully-vaccinated people who have come down with the Delta variant!  My friend’s fully-vaccinated husband briefly ended up in intensive care and is home recovering.  His fully-vaccinated health care aide tested positive, so it is most likely that she gave it to him.  A fully-vaccinated member of my book club who was recently on a plane was just diagnosed with Delta this week.  We had been feeling relaxed and  safe and were meeting in person without masks, as all twelve of us were fully-vaccinated.  Thank goodness that this Delta-positive member missed book club last week as it could have turned into a super-spreader event!

Bottom line.  Mask up.  Stay out of crowds.  We never ever should have stopped masking up.  The virus is doing what all viruses do - mutating.  Vaccinations are going to keep the vast majority of us from dying but it’s mighty clear that they will not protect us from getting ill and/or infecting others.

As for the anti-maskers and anti-vaccers.  You are most likely going to get this and may die or become a vector and kill others.  Can you really look at yourself in the mirror, knowing this?  Are you that careless about your health and the lives of your fellow humans?  There is no shame in changing your stance on this.  It means you care."

The extreme close quarters in bars, house parties and sleeping conditions is not how 99% of people live.  These are perfect conditions for a respiratory disease.  It is not the local grocery.  

Actionable insight: get vaxxed and stay out of nightclubs.  You will be fine. No masks needed."
2021-07-30 23:03:12,"Talk about fear mongering among the vaccinated! In this outbreak with so many vaccinated infected, only four vaccinated individuals were sick enough to require hospitalization, and two of those four had serious underlying medical conditions.

No to mask mandates
Yes to vaccine mandates"
2021-07-30 18:18:59,"In a month, we will have the next variant.  Then we will continue through the Greek alphabet with new and potentially more serious versions.

I really don't care whether the virus was man-made or leaped from animals...pointless blame game at this moment.  But those republicans who continue to try to point fingers at the Chinese who are covering up a lab leak, are denying the reality of a virus that they are so loudly blaming on China!  If you think it is man-made, you should be ducking and covering, not promoting freedom to die!

Variants will continue until everyone is vaccinated.  Pick your poison, vaccine or death/suffering/long Covid/immense medical bills."
2021-07-30 20:58:29,"“Even the vaccinated carry high virus levels if they become infected”, this article states, as if that would be a surprise. 

why is this a surprise? this is the basics of viral infection. you need a high viral load to get sick from a virus. if anything, one might speculate that a vaccinated person would need a *higher* viral load than an unvaccinated person, to get a breakthrough infection. 

but, assuming they need the same viral load, since we don’t know, why would anyone then assume that the vaccinated and sick person’s viral load would be any *less* transmissible than that of an unvaccinated and sick person’s? 

the vaccines were proven in testing to *hugely* reduce infection, and especially serious illness, hospitalization, and death. (which is highly important, don’t get me wrong — i got the vaccine ASAP, in case it’s not clear where i fall on this topic). 

but as far as i remember, NO statements were made about it reducing the possibility of spreading infection — ie. transmission. i remember learning that eg. the yearly flu vaccine reduces one’s chances of infection, but not transmission. so this is normal with vaccines. so why would anyone, esp. the scientific community, assume that vaccinated people couldn’t spread it if they by chance GOT it? let alone be silent carriers?

and now we have the CDC having to change what it said just a couple months ago about masking for the vaccinated, confusing people, and which no doubt fuels the antivaxxers’ misinformation. sigh."
2021-07-30 22:26:47,"The numerical incompetency of the CDC is astounding. There were 60000 people in Provincetown. 1000 tested positive for SARS-COV-2 (1.7%). 5 hospitalized. Isn’t this what the vaccine was supposed do?The CDC is making policy decisions based on 1.7%? And they are convinced that if the vaccinated were masking (of course properly) there would be 0. There are 162 million vaccinated people and a decision based on 60000? Follow the science does not mean ignore math. Also, the percentage of Covid-19 infections from vaccinated individuals will increase as more people are vaccinated. Pointing to the percentage without looking at the number of cases is stupid. If 2 people had Covid and one was vaccinated, then the CDC and press would say 50% of Covid infections come from vaccinated individuals. 

The CDC’s new policy is an attempt at covering up their failure to get unvaccinated vaccinated (and contrary to many commenters’ belief, many unvaccinated are non Trumpers) . We have an insanely effective weapon against the virus. And there is little evidence that masking the vaccinated is going to change that. The CDC uses sensitive models with large margins of error (look at the released report) to make decisions. 

We can live with Covid (sans masking and social distancing)  with vaccines. We live with many viruses (and who knows how many unknown ones). To quote a virologist that NYT interviewed, ‘the sky is not falling.’"
2021-07-30 17:56:34,"The Delta variant is becoming a problem. But Provincetown may not be a good sample case. P-town has a large gay community and to the extent that some of these people may be immunocompromised, even if they are fully vaccinated they may not have registered a full immune response. The same would hold true for people over 65, which is why Pfizer is recommending booster shots for any population which may be likely to have a lower than normal immune response to the two-shot vaccination procedure."
2021-07-30 18:15:58,"Wake up CDC - always lagging behind the rest of the world by weeks and even months. News flash for future NYT article from September - vaccinated people with Delta can also get SEVERE Covid and get Hospitalized, and, sometimes, even die, especially if they are elderly, and if circa 5 months have passed since their 2nd shot (see very clear data from Israel, UK), but also sooner. In fact, there are already increasingly such cases right now in the States. So yes, vaccinated people, you too should fear for your own lives and well being, as well as being decent to your neighbors, and mask up, and politicians of all stripes should have reinstated indoor mask mandates and maximum vaccine mandates yesterday. In fact , they should have never taken mask mandates off in the first place. The management of the virus in this country is beyond ludicrous, and the quality of the reporting, comes only at close second. It is true that the right wing politicians and media are beyond the pale, but that shouldn't make the liberal side smug, because it shines only by comparison, and is quite pathetic by any reasonable measure. The entire country is a mess, and should open its eyes to the rest of the world, it can learn a thing or two!"

""Of the five people who were hospitalized, four were fully vaccinated.""

Statistically, this doesn't line up with their communication about breakthrough cases ? The overwhelming majority of infections are in fully vaccinated people, and the majority of hospitalizations are in fully vaccinated people ?

So lets stop pointing the finger at those who for whatever reason have chosen to hold off on the shot.  Vaxxed people can and do get COVID and spread it. I personally got COVID and it gave me severe tinnitus that made me want to die anyway.  It has gotten 50% better and I am just not willing to take the risk of having that return.  Being made a scapegoat and being criticized for not being vaxxed, especially when it seems like it doesn't actually protect YOU, seems out of line."

I live in Florida where we have both sides. It literally comes down to neighbors.  I have decent neighbors. Let's call them Elaine and Roy. Older, white, church going and friendly. Both supported Trump and both haven't gotten vaccinated. Elaine is the more talkative while Roy is kind of standoffish.  

I had recently seen Elaine and asked her how her summer was. I was assuming the answers would dwell around hot and saw some good family or travelled. 

She began to cry and told me her mother had just died from Covid-related complications.  I was crestfallen and exchanged my own experience of an older uncle who passed away last year from it. Then we both kind of teared up.

I then asked if there was anything I could do. She said thanks but she was in a bit of a spell, although she was very happy to have gotten her first shot at a CVS. I asked how Roy was. They are getting a divorce. ""He doesn't believe in anything unless Trump tells him it's okay.""  

I kept thinking of that. And Fox and Tucker Carlson. And the endless bumper stickers and blus line or Trump flags.

All I could say to myself at the end of the day: Is Donald Trump, a cheesy con man grifter who nearly died himself after writing off Covid and is now experiencing early dementia, really worth this?"
2021-07-30 23:27:59,"The lack of clear, concise and consistent messaging from both the White House and federal agencies since the beginning of the pandemic has been awful.

The CDC should hire a leading consumer brand (Nike, McDonald’s) ad agency and get out a short, impactful and memorable message that leaves no room for ambiguity (and can be adapted worldwide).

I’ve grown tired of the CDC’s and government’s fumbling around with their confusing and ineffectual communication.

People that are totally asymptomatic of any detectable problem are not 'rare'. They are vastly under reported, IMHO.

My guess is that these people are virtually distinguishable from healthy people."

I have never gotten a disease that I was vaccinated for.

I have come to expect that a vaccine will PREVENT my getting the disease and infecting others.  I would assume most people's expectation of the function of a vaccine is similar--it PREVENTS disease in the vaccinated.

We have spent billions of dollars on COVID vaccines that don't seem to PREVENT disease in the vaccinated, if the rate of disease among vaccinated people in a cluster is the same as the rate of vaccinated people in their general population.  Provincetown--70-75% of those cluster cases were among the vaccinated; 70% of Massachusetts residents are vaccinated, and similar high rates are present in its surrounding states.   In addition, one suspects that Provincetown visitors are higher income and probably have higher vaccination rates than lower income individuals in any state if the news is to be believed.

2021-07-30 23:48:57,"Folks, too many people seem to be missing the boat here, and the CDC is faulty in its inability to get the message out clearly.

First of all, consider that very little (really) is known about covid right now.  At first everyone thought it was only respiratory, and now we know it's also gastrointestinal in many cases.

For every person who remains unvaccinated, he or she becomes the perfect host, or, if you prefer, Petri dish, for the virus to live, mutate, and do a job on you, and then others.

Consider that the link between chicken pox and shingles was YEARS before science and medicine figured that one out.

Consider that HPV (human papilloma virus) was thought be a benign little venereal disease -- and now it's been linked to among other things, cervical cancer, and for which there is now (thanks to science) a vaccine -- which was initially only administered to girls and is now also recommended for boys. 

Every day something new is learned.

We don't know, 5, 10, 15 years from now, what effect covid will have on those who've contracted it -- no matter how serious or mild a case it was.  

Do not take the CDC's information for granted.  Be careful, and observe and obey their advice.  

Remember -- Pluto was once a planet.  It is no longer considered one. 
Science evolves on a daily basis.  So should you in appreciating its efforts to save your life and those of your families and friends."

I called to confirm and told the office to please make certain that any staff in the room with me are fully vaccinated.  I was told they (the dental practice) were not allowed to ask staff there if they were vaccinated.  It was private.  So they will approach my privacy rights when I arrive by asking if I have a temp, a cough, or a cold, if I've traveled out of the country recently, if I've been exposed to anyone who tested positive recently, or if I've tested positive recently. Then they want me to sign to confirm I'm being truthful.   But they refuse to tell me if the staff who are in my face while my mask is off, have been vaccinated.  So the plan is to infringe on my privacy, protect theirs, make certain I do not put them at risk, but they can put me at risk.  No wonder we can't get control of Covid.

The price of our freedom is that we cannot just arrest these people and vaccinate them by force, which none of us would ever agree to, but they have a duty to our democracy to act for the common good.

Also, that crowd is more likely (than a covid/vax denier) to get tested at the first sign of mild symptoms, or with no symptoms ""just to know""... Also, people who tested positive are likely to advise their friends with whom they hung out that weekend to get tested (which likely led to the identification of a lot of asymptomatic cases).

“This is one of the most impressive examples of citizen science I have seen,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. “The people involved in the Provincetown outbreak were meticulous in making lists of their contacts and exposures.”

Well the flood comes and the man is stranded on his roof. A canoe comes by and the people offer to save him. He says no, the Good Lord will save him! Then a row boat comes by and the people again offer to rescue him. He again declines. Finally a helicopter comes by and the loudspeaker says they'll drop a basket for him. He waves them off, sure that the Good Lord will protect and save him. The man drowns when the flood sweeps over his house. At heaven's gate, he is crestfallen and when he meets the Good Lord he wonders aloud why he wasn't saved?? The Lord replies: I sent you a canoe, I sent you a row boat and then a helicopter! What did you think was going to happen?? 
The Good Lord or Supreme Being provided us with smart people who can save us with science and vaccines. Only fools will refuse them."

The CDC should give “full approval” to Covid vaccines, not “emergency use” anymore. Period.
Another thought: If vaccine companies are making a fortune out of this calamity, I want to see a fund set up that anyone vaccinated and suffering a severe adverse effect (e.g.thrombosis, myocarditis) should be compensated. No “ifs ands or buts”!"
2021-07-30 17:47:49,"Wonder why folks don’t trust the CDC?  Let’s see, 469 cases, 75% of whom were fully vaccinated. If 75% of the population in Provincetown - more or less - is vaccinated, that would indicate no benefit from the vaccine. At all.

Oh sure they got infected but they weren’t hospitalized thanks to the vaccine. We’re told.  And here 4 of the 5 were….. fully vaccinated. So statistically being unvaccinated in this outbreak seems to be protective.

And an internal memo telling us all to mask up.  Look. All I want. All any of us wants— is for someone to stop spinning and just tell us the truth."
2021-07-31 00:24:27,"One thing we need are better drugs to treat Covid if you're unfortunate enough to get a serious case, regardless of vaccination status.

For this, like it or not, we need drug companies.  Yes, for all their flaws, we need a viable pharmaceutical industry.  They are the ones with the resources to develop, test, and manufacture drugs.

But there's a problem.  American trial lawyers are driving many drug companies towards bankruptcy.  Most of the lawsuits are based on junk science, sympathetic plaintiffs, and juries driven by emotion.

Again, drug companies are flawed.  We still need a system to compensate the injured.  But the system we have is badly flawed, and must be reformed.

Think about it.  We need drugs and vaccines more than we need lawsuits."

1. How many people went back to their home states and got sick without being counted in this studies follow up?
2. How many people in MA who showed symptoms refused to comply with contact tracing? They don't report the number attempted to trace vs the number successfully traced.
3. How many people total were there? I've seen numbers from 50-60k in other reports. That gives an incidence of vaccine breakthrough consistent with scientific prediction.
4. Why so many males?

Given that these are people willing to go to a multi-day, shared house party with tens of thousands of people during a pandemic, they sound like a group specially selected to be outliers. It's just not convincing. I had expected better science from the CDC to raise this level of alarm over. NYT alluded to some unknown content they got hold of, but didn't report on it here.

And for those worried about your child dying, better to place your worries elsewhere. So far Covid has killed 340 children. Tragic? Of course it is, but during this same period of time over 50,000 children have died from other causes. And in an average year, 12,000 children die from accidental causes alone.  We need to keep the risk in perspective."
2021-07-30 23:24:35,"In Provincetown, 75% of the 450+ cases were in vaccinated people. That doesn’t seem “rare.” It would be helpful to know about how many people total were at those July 4th festivities so we could get an idea, at least in this instance, how likely it is that a vaccinated person contracts the virus. Also helpful, whether they were indoors/outdoors and masked or not. This info helps the public make informed decisions. For example, parents of young, unvaccinated children, need to decide whether it is safe to go back to the office, where vaccines aren’t required, if they are masked but others aren’t? Safe to send young children to school if not everyone is masked?"
2021-07-31 00:34:00,"“They do not know for certain that the Delta variant causes more severe disease in the unvaccinated who become infected, although early data suggest it does.”

2021-07-30 23:49:15,"COVID-19 is a fluid disease.  It is a moving target.  That is the nature of the viral disease processes, especially in a pandemic. 

There seem to be many out there who think that whatever information, advisories, or directives come from the CDC or via the Biden administration should be the last word on the subject.  ""That's it!  Done and dusted.  Now I can go back and stick my head in the sand.""  No wonder they are angry and tired and belligerent.  Americans are addicted to ""the quick and easy fix"" and COVID-19 has none to offer.

There is not now, nor will there ever be a final, definitive, all-encompassing ""answer"" to what works best on a virus that continues to grow and mutate--especially with so many people willing to be petrie dishes for its insidious cause.

Pat answers don't exist.  But, learned guidance does exist.  If you want to take care of yourself and your family, you will actually have to expend some effort and will have to tolerate discomfort and inconvenience.  You will need to keep up with the latest learnings by those who continue to study the disease as it morphs.  That will require going to reputable news sources like the NYT and WAPO.  FaceBook, YouTube, Fox News, and Twitter are not your friends.  It will require getting vaccinated, wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding any kind of activity that places you in a crowd.  That's the truth.  Until this is over, everything else is fantasy."

Those who are immunocompromised should go back to lockdown.  The rest of us need to decide if a 1/10 risk of hospitalization is worth rolling the dice.

With the exception of doing away with the mask recommendation - major boneheaded move, Biden! - the CDC has done reasonably well, except when they've been deliberately messed with by the Trump admin.

Vaccines became available in January. It's eight months later. In coastal Maine, in the thick of the summer tourist season, I'm watching the vast majority of people wander around maskless.  So not only do the unvaccinated get zero sympathy from me - and I'm sick to death of the NYT publishing death bed hand wringing - but I'm also no longer giving a pass to the vaccinated who decided to throw all caution to the wind after the second dose - and continue to do so."

Why don't health insurers begin to surcharge people who choose not to be vaccinated?   Or refuse to cover them or even deny coverage for hospitalization due to Covid if you refused vaccination?  The health care costs of the anti vaxxers who are hospitalized is distributed to all of us.  More of the burden should be on them."

Is a ""breakthrough infection"" synonymous with being ill/symptomatic or does it include a person ""carrying"" the virus at a detectable level/load without realizing it or feeling ill?

2021-07-31 02:16:14,"The repeated  description of breakthrough cases being rare really needs to be qualified and reads like propaganda from the CDC.  The Times should be casting a more critical eye on the information that is coming out of the CDC.  At this point, the reality is that we don’t know what the frequency or rate of breakthrough cases is.  What we might be seeing now are breakthrough cases for people who were vaccinated early on in the pandemic.  They would be the first group to lose protection.  People vaccinated later would lose protection later on.  The CDC should be analyzing breakthrough data with this variable in mind.  And similarly, the Times should not be buying into the party line from the CDC, who have been backtracking, reversing themselves and sowing confusion  throughout the pandemic."
2021-07-31 01:30:33,"The  CDC ""said infections in vaccinated people were comparatively rare."" If 65% of the population is vaccinated and 75% of the cases in the Provincetown outbreak occurred in vaccinated individuals, I would say in this instance that people who were unvaccinated were less likely to be infected with COVID compared with those that are vaccinated. Obviously, I can't say if this is statistically significant, but I can say beyond a doubt that it is certainly not RARE. Instead of regurgitating whatever the CDC decides to feed you, you should be asking why this study wasn't undertaken 4 months ago with the delta variant arrived in the United States. Since the beginning of this pandemic the CDC has been months behind the curve and obviously is not making up any ground. The real story is how did a world renowned institution fall so far."
2021-07-31 01:11:53,"The pandemic is disastrous. But most of us have developed strategies and coping skills and have made it through. Whatever number you choose to rank the  harm caused by COVID, most have other harms in their lives ranked higher. Not so in the media where COVID is a 20 on a scale of 1 to 10.  This is harmful. COVID is not a 20. Nothing is. And as bad as it is, reporting on it as if it were the end of the world is harmful andivisive. 

The inevitable result of ranking COVID as 20 is widespread hostility toward  those at 5 or less. The best way to deal with those with rankings that are too low and put others at risk is not hostility. Forced compliance is constructive. There is nothing constructive about hostility. You solve the problem by solving the problem. Blaming others is a dead end."
2021-07-31 02:45:05,"I think every conscientious vaccinated person was worried this would be true and continued to wear mask regardless of the CDC’s terrible, unfounded and short-lived guideline that we could go maskless. People with someone vulnerable at home needed cautious, evidence driven recommendations, not assumptions that we will all pay for with even more confusion and resistance from anti-masker/anti-vaxxers and more infections and deaths."
2021-07-31 00:53:28,"So if your a federal employee you only have to get tested every week and not hv to get vaccinated? And if you don't get tested what's the  consequence? Baby slap on the wrist? Biden needs to step up to the plate and solve the lack of vaccination problems with real consequences, not by handing out $100, or sending Jill to the Olympics with a mask. How about no Social Security payments, no private medical insurance, no access to planes, public transportation or federal roads. Government employees and all government contractors are fired or lose their contracts. Real things with real consequences is what real leadership has to do in  crisis. Come on Joe!"
2021-07-31 02:15:32,"Even if they know full vaccination for COVID looks something like flu vaccination that is effective less than 50%, against Delta, they would never say so now. Maybe they would do in a couple of months with a lot of excuses."
2021-07-31 02:08:11,"Correct me if I am wrong, but the picture I am getting after reading all of the latest news on Delta is that:
1.  Delta is much more contagious than other variants of COVID-19
2.  Delta breeds in anyone's sinuses, regardless of vaccination status.  This is a totally unexpected finding and yet to be fully comprehended.
3.  Delta is spread to anyone else from the sinuses
4.  Delta will make it into the lungs of unvaccinated folks and perhaps make them seriously ill or kill them.
5.  Delta will most likely not make its way into the lungs of people who are vaccinated, hence they will be mostly spared serious disease and death. 

These facts change everything and the pivot needs to be very quick."
2021-07-31 01:41:47,"Another thought, in addition to what I have shared below:

Another commenter pointed out that 4 of the 5 hospitalized were vaccinated - similar to the proportion of people infected.  Then does the vaccine really protect against severe disease?

It's impossible to answer this question by looking at only 5 cases.  It is far more meaningful that the vast majority (maybe 98-99%) of hospitalization cases nationally are among the unvaccinated.  I think that is a much more reliable number.

But why the extreme difference between Provincetown and the rest of the country.  Is it just dumb luck?

We know that the vaccine lessens disease severity with prior strains of COVID.  However, the delta strain is different.  It can pass from cell to cell by fusing cells together, completely evading circulating antibodies.  So once you become infected with the delta variant, it could be that the vaccine actually does you no good.

Then why are almost all the hospitalization cases among the unvaccinated, even when delta is the dominant strain?  Perhaps the value of the vaccine is prevention of infection more than lessening of severity of of the disease.  That could explain how people with breakthrough infections seem to be just as infectious as unvaccinated infected people.

And finally, as with any vaccine, the COVID vaccine only prevents infection to a point.  Pile into a crowded bar with an infected person who is screaming in your face, and all bets are off.

We do need more research."
2021-07-31 00:40:34,"Despite the alarmist headlines, here is what I’ve learned from recent articles about COVID in the NYT:

1. It’s rare for vaccinated people to become infected.

2. It’s even more rare for them to have symptoms.

3. It’s even more rare for them to transmit the virus to other vaccinated people.

4. It is possible that vaccinated people with rare “breakthrough” infections can transmit COVID to unvaccinated people.

5. Children still rarely acquire COVID. Those who do rarely suffer serious illness.

Take away: I am vaccinated. I am safe. I could potentially infect an unvaccinated person, but that’s on them. I am going out, going to work, living my life, and returning to normal. You can do what you want."

2021-07-30 23:58:38,"Zero is the number of people who have died from wearing a mask. Compare that to the over 600,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19. Masks are mentioned zero times in the Constitution but the right to vote is mentioned five times. Excuse me, who is trampling on whose rights?  People cannot wander publicly with zero clothing on.

2021-07-31 00:36:26,"The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson that have approve in the US have efficacy rates. None are 100%. So why is the press referring to cases as ""breakthrough?"" There is no breakthrough unless there is 100% efficacy. And with the Delta variant, others to come, that does not bode well.

Science, percentages. There are no breakthroughs. What is happening is cases are hitting the scene and without masks and continued social distancing, this is a nightmare that will never be over. 

It is called percentages. Not breakthroughs.

2021-07-31 03:14:13,"I am all for vaccination mandate, but we already may be getting close  to the point where all adults are either vaccinated or have had Covid. In Britain, that is 92% of the population, so we are seeing sharp dropoffs. Unfortunately, in the US we don't know. 

The rate of reinfection for those who have had Covid is the same as those who have been vaccinated. So this virus will be much less prevalent in a few weeks. 

However, it's not going to go away for a very long time. And if immunity fades in say another six months or a year, we will be at this again. At that time, we definitely need a vaccination mandate -- no flying, transit, federal buildings entrance etc. until vaccinated."
2021-07-31 03:16:14,"But breakthrough infections are not all that rare, from what we’re seeing in my little world (a nursing home in SW FL) (Pfizer & Moderna vacs used for both patients and staff).  But, again, the vaccinated have been having mild or no symptoms."
2021-07-31 04:53:43,"Because antibodies associated with the mucosa of the respiratory system are generally of the IgA type, I wonder if any of the antibodies induced by these vaccines happen to be IgA antibodies.  There may be specific adjuvants added to these vaccines that can help to induce production of these IgA antibodies."
2021-07-31 05:22:52,Isn't transmission directly proportional to the symptoms? Any corona positive person can transmit the disease (vaccinated or unvaccinated). Vaccines reduce the severity of the disease which equals lesser symptoms equals to lesser transmission. Only time will tell how fast the breakthroughs happen with newer variants.
2021-07-31 06:03:33,"I'm curious about what this means for Long Covid. Sure, the vaccine protects strongly against severe infection/death, but even asymptomatic transmission or lesser infections can lead to Long Covid, with all its life-changing/quality of life consequences. 

Are there any figures yet on breakthrough acquisitions of Long Covid, or is it too early for that?"
2021-07-31 04:51:46,"As several have said and science has made abundantly clear, the efficacy of the best vaccines are not 100% therefor there is no breakthrough per se ... just the percentages playing out, especially as more transmissible variants appear.
Shall we mandate vaccinations for those who wish to be in public environments?  I feel strongly that stopping smoking in public was a protection of individual rights i.e. that ones right to smoke did not including harming others with ones smoking. Likewise you can own a gun but that does not allow you do fire it towards another person.
Let's get over the violation-of-individual-rights nonsense if we're not going to include our right to be protected from those who would cause harm to others."
2021-07-31 03:34:04,"Mandating vaccines will likely not work.   The very sad reality is that many that haven’t been vaccinated never will, regardless of the carrot or stick held in front of them!  That’s hard to swallow, but true.   
Many in high risk areas will succumb to dead and others will suffer with long covid-19.  There is only so much the federal government is capable of doing from an enforcement and public policy angle! 

The delta variant is extremely contagious.    The best anybody can do is be fully vaccinated and wear a mask (preferably an N95) and avoid indoor and outdoor crowds.

Lesson hopefully learned is that vaccines cannot keep up with mutating viruses.

I am also concerned with how restaurants and bars will survive this current setback, considering that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated now need to mask-up.  It seems as if restaurants and bars should get proof of a very recent negative COVID test (in addition to proof of vaccination) from a potential customer in order to be seated. Wouldn’t your average citizen think that this added barrier of getting a negative COVID test, just to enjoy an evening of dining and drinking, too burdensome?"

If research hasn't yet proved that vaccinated people can't spread the virus, everyone should keep wearing masks. If persuasion tactics by the CDC work some of the time but not all of the time, these tactics are bound to breed mistrust. If mistrust begets refusal to vaccinate, the CDC must abandon persuasion tactics and deal only in the truth."

Very much do not like the fact that our Nat'l Inst. of Allergy and Infectious Disease and CDC had zero progress on vaccines or had lacked any functioning tracking/tracing and couldn't make test kits early in the cycle. And in fact CDC still does not have tracking capacity to monitor breakthrough infections, and is only able to track them once hospitalized: once the horse is lost they then seem to grasp the concept of a ""door."" 
Our system lacks leadership, and it’s been that way since before Trump, during Trump and even now CDC is limited to overreaction to events rather than understanding them. We were warned about SARS 20 years ago, and we were warned about Delta via UK/India months ago. 
Instead of a plan, CDC and the Executive have used fear instead of well-articulated facts, since the beginning, to drive behaviors. 
This is a badly functioning system run by well-meaning people. Incompetent? The system, yes."
2021-07-31 07:05:40,"If you add the 58% vaccinated to the numbers of unvaccinated with some immunity from prior infection, it doesn’t take a mathematician to see that we shouldn’t be seeing such a dramatic new wave of cases if things were going anywhere close to how we hoped with herd immunity. I thought we were at the end a few months ago, but now I think this virus isn’t anywhere close to done with us. If Delta is a major leap in evolution, and we’re only a year and a half post-release, how many more leaps are ahead of us? The hope was that the virus would be stable enough evolutionarily to be very vulnerable to vaccination, but I don’t think that’s proving to be true. And before any of you liberal warriors attack me, I’m a proponent of vaccination, since it at least primes the immune response prior to infection and gives the host a better shot."
2021-07-31 10:55:38,"In time, everyone in the country is going to become immune to Covid. Two ways to do it: either get vaccinated or get Covid. At this point, those who are not getting vaccinated are simply selecting the second path to immunity. The hospitalizations and deaths among the fully vaccinated will remain very low."
2021-07-31 11:48:43,It's a huge country. There are bound to be some pockets of vaccinated people that have breakthroughs. Not the end if the world. We're still going in the right direction. Not every single person will be completely fine. They weren't in the beginning (vast majority of breakthroughs are immune compromised).
2021-07-31 12:00:43,"I am all in favor of indoor public venues like restaurants, bars, theaters, museums, arenas, and concert halls requiring proof of full vaccination to allow access. Enough is enough."
2021-07-31 11:07:06,"I'm in my 60's as is my wife so we chose to get the vaccine. With that said, I can understand people being hesitant about getting the vaccine, especially if they are younger and healthy. We know that a small percentage of people have serious reactions to it. We really don't know if there may be long-term side effects from the vaccine. Some people prefer to catch COVID and build up a natural immunity. So even though I believe I made the right decision getting the vaccine, I also believe people should have a choice. Meanwhile, we still don't have answers from our government on whether the virus was man-made or of natural origin. We still don't know, if it indeed came from the Wuhan lab, if it was accidental or on purpose. We don't know for certain if masks actually help or not. We don't know the ""real"" number of deaths due to COVID. We don't know if the variants will continue to evolve and how effective the vaccine will be on these variants. We don't know if those of us who are vaccinated with need booster shots. Last but not least, nothing to my knowledge, absolutely nothing, has been done to punish China for their cover-up and misinformation about the virus which lead to the rapid spread of COVID around the world."
2021-07-31 11:54:09,"In my opinion, this new “finding” is not terrible news.  Even if vaccinated people can spread the virus, they are going to spread it to either another vaccinated person (who is protected against severe illness) or an unvaccinated person (who has chosen not to be protected).  In regards to the vaccinated but immunocompromised or elderly, it seems to me that they, if they do choose, might want to wear masks in crowded places to protect themselves.  If they want.  In the same way that any vaccinated person can choose to wear a mask if they want extra protection."
2021-07-31 11:57:57,"The graph in this article that shows the fatality rate and infection rate of COVID and the Delta variant relative to other known infectious diseases is an excellent way to communicate the uncertainty in the data.  Would love to see those data ranges split into two, to compare the outlook for vaccinated vs unvaccinated people."
2021-07-31 13:09:31,"This is a most important message. 

Of course, it is best to keep distances and protect yourself if you are at risk or in environments where you do not know the people around you ... true even during flu seasons going forward. 

Vaccinations protect people from all kinds of viruses, but 100% will never be.

Balanced transparency is always best. Over reacting and over stating generalised risks in life will always be counter productive (one size fits all).  Some will become zealots, other ignore the message. (We know, for instance, that more died of fentanyl than Covid in San Fransisco, for instance, probably in other places too.)

Most people are capable of dealing with balanced information in a democracy."
2021-07-31 06:24:27,"Let me be very clear: I am am fully vaccinated and have worn N-95 masks from day one (March 2020). I am also a scientist.

But I am unhappy about the CDC. To the American public certainly not the “gold standard” they think they are.

Among scientists nuanced messages are fine, but for the American public this is poison: No masks (March 2020), then masks, then no masks (May 2021), then mask again (now). Vaccines are almost 100% effective, they will retain their effectiveness for years to come. Or maybe not. Booster shots are coming, but do not go out now to get one. Wait until we announce, and the lines are long again. The vaccinated do not spread the virus, or they do. But rarely. School children need to be six feet apart, or three, or it does not matter because it’s aerosol spread. So expensive ventilation systems are required. Or just keep the windows open.

Enough already.

Simply say to get vaccinated and universally wear masks indoors. Mandates to that effect should follow."
2021-07-31 11:08:53,"We need to take what we can get.   The masks leak, the tests aren't always accurate, the vaccines aren't foolproof.   Yet I'm for all of these things and grateful every day they give us quite a bit more agency and lead time over Covid than cancer."
2021-07-31 11:51:13,"In a free society, the distinction between medical advice and medical mandates would be very carefully delimited. I'm very surprised that such discussions are completely absent from our discourse. Where are the professors of jurisprudence and political philosophy to weigh in on when  the state should legally be allowed to compel action by the citizens, under threat of fine? ""Saving lives"" and ""public health"" don't seem the right standard, otherwise the state could mandate anything to those ends, like eating broccoli, getting exercise, sleeping 8 hours, saying home after 9pm to reduce crime, driving only for work, etc. Perhaps we need to hear more of this discussion? In my reading of law review articles, before Covid there was extensive work and hard-won international agreements designed to limit the power of the state during pandemics, all of which seems to have gone quiet."
2021-07-31 09:43:45,"Personally, I think work places should mandate the vaccine - NOT vaccination OR weekly test.  One could be vaccinated on Monday AM, become infected that evening, and pass the virus around for several days before the positive test the following week. There should be no out - get the shot or find another job. Period."
2021-07-31 04:46:56,"Missing from this article, but not the one on the CDC website, is the fact that both unvaccinated and vaccinated patients had the same CT which was 24.  CT is Cycle Threshold, the number of times the PCR needs to be run to get a positive signal.  It is an indirect measurement of the number of viral particles in the nose.  Heretofore, it took a CT in the mid 30s to identify a previously vaccinated person who had the virus again.  These folks, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, had the same amount of virus in the nose, as measured by PCR CT.  So unlike the other variants, while the vaccine does continue to be protective to those vaccinated, those who are unvaccinated can take no comfort from being in the presence of those who are vaccinated.  This is a huge change, and makes the unvaccinated 100 million of us in real trouble.  Remember, it takes 6 weeks from the first shot to get full vaccine effect."
2021-07-31 09:32:30,"In Ireland, up to 10% of daily new cases, 20% of hospital admissions, and 2% of deaths have come in people who are fully vaccinated.  Masks continued to be required indoors and life is NOT back to normal.  Vaccinations are our best defence, but they are not a complete solution.  Our vaccination rate is much higher than that in the US (72% of population fully vaccinated) but our cases are going up, as are hospitalisations, but thankfully not deaths.  The number of people here who do not want to be vaccinated is minuscule, but we still have a Covid problem."
2021-07-31 10:46:12,"Turns out the CDC is using those Massachusetts figures, which are highly irregular.  Masks should be used in certain situations.  How those large gatherings somehow translate into someone in a grocery store is a mystery."
2021-07-31 11:41:31,"I’m happy I’ve had both vaccine doses and grateful I live in a country that made it available. 
Like many vaccines, it’s not a 100% guarantee but makes illness and death unlikely. 

I understand the frustration and risks we face because some eligible people refuse vaccination. 
However, I respect free will in this particular area.  People must make this decision for themselves. 

It would be a slippery slope.  There are many infectious diseases in a community. We could easily rationalize that everyone be vaccinated for everything, against their will, to protect community health. 
And ultimately there would be no community worth living in without respect for individuals."
2021-07-31 11:38:29,"We are seeing biological evolution in real time.
The COVID virus is evolving to maximize reproduction in the presence of vaccines.
The current generation of vaccines is still mostly effective, even against the Delta variant.  Everyone should get vaccinated as soon as possible, including children.
But by next year, newly configured vaccines will be necessary."
2021-07-31 11:18:55,"Key is mild or no symptoms because they were vaccinated. Even if it spread, mild or no symptoms due to vaccination."
2021-07-31 12:03:47,"In addition to knowing, as one reader suggested, which vaccines were taken by those with breakthrough cases, it would be helpful to know when they were vaccinated and whether it was done properly, with the second shot being given in the required time frame. If, for example, the majority of breakthrough cases occur in people who were vaccinated in December/January, and/or did not receive the second shot within the proscribed time range, we might be able to draw conclusions about whether boosters are needed and the value or wisdom of getting vaccinated by the book. 

I am not surprised by the breakthrough cases or the transmission by the vaccinated, because the vaccines weren't required to address those problems. It was all about hospitalizations and death. In retrospect, it seems too low a bar. Hopefully, authorizations/approvals of future vaccines will address transmission."
2021-07-31 12:57:32,"This good work by the CDC is all an important run-up to again use the badly needed mail-in and drop box ballots in 2022.

Same or more so for 2022 as in 2020.  

We must keep all voters safe.  We must do all we can to make the early availability of mail-in and drop box ballots a requirement in all 50 states."
2021-07-31 10:21:20,I am frustrated at the continual changing of the goals: slow the spread so the hospitalized can be treated.  It was never the plan to mask until zero infections.  I am vaccinated and I will not mask up any longer.  Unvaccinated people can wear masks or not wear masks. Individual choice.
2021-07-31 04:30:05,Can't Desantis and other Republican governors be sued for endangering the lives of their states' citizens by banning local health measures such as masking and vaccinations?
2021-07-31 06:07:20,"Dear Folks,

I think we are still swimming in a PANDEMIC and no matter how many Vaccines are out there, if we do not AIM at vaccinating the right number/% percentage of our GLOBAL Population we will continue to have a Very Big  Problem (&lasting problem) on our hands.  How does approx. total 4 years sound to everyone?
That’s why we don’t call this “manifestation” or “viral experience “ an Epidemic.  It does not just come and go getting weaker by time.
It is an excellent Virus which continues to mutate into whatever new form Nature has in store for it.  Frankly we are still learning about it every day.  The situation has obviously improved (after 18 months or let’s just say 2 YEARS) However; look at theTrue total number of deaths in India.   Any idea what happened over there.  Are our counts in Brazil accurate.  What about China…another wild guess.   Pandemics are successful at massive clean up of entire populations since millennia  and today we still wonder or argue about this.   Go ahead.. forget the masks, and lets just keep working on reaching a minimal immunization policy for our world.
I am sorry, but a big chunk of our mankind is not so intelligent.  If all the people not vaccinated All stayed on their specially created island 🏝 or elsewhere in space, then we the remainder could continue to live and yes, not get infected.  Best we keep our masks on just in case.   We are in for a long haul."
2021-07-31 06:11:26,"“About 58 percent of Americans ages 12 and older are fully vaccinated. The pace of vaccination has slowed to just over 500,000 people per day, although it has begun curving slightly upward in the past couple of weeks as infections rise again.”

If we maintain that rate of vaccination, by when should we reach “herd immunity”? Is “herd immunity” still our ultimate goal?"
2021-07-31 13:10:35,"Breakthrough cases are not rare. Several of our friends and colleagues have become ill. We need to face reality. The vaccines may protect against hospitalization and death, and that is a miracle, but they are not preventing many - not merely a few- people from becoming sick.

Apart from the danger to themselves, which frankly at this point I care very little about, the major danger posed by the unvaccinated is that of continuing mutations and a potentially deadly, vaccine-evading variant. The CDC has described this risk, but has not highlighted it. I understand there is already a potential new variant in Florida.

I hesitate to exaggerate by warning “extinction event”, but if a variant develops that is deadly, as contagious as the chickenpox, and can escape the vaccine, many hundreds of thousands will die. 

We - states and municipalities- must reimpose restrictions immediately, resign ourselves to several months of shut downs & remote learning, require the FDA to provide final approval for the vaccines, so that people can get a third shot, and start working on boosters to protect against new variants. A 3rd shot is will not protect against a variant that evades the vaccines.

While I hate to be a Cassandra, I did not travel from a three room, floor-through family flat in a dicey part of Brooklyn, to a semi-secure life in the suburbs, by avoiding reality. Better to face the truth, and solve the problem, than pretend everything is OK and get hit in the face by a tidal wave."
2021-07-31 04:24:55,"Though I support Biden, on July 4th I believed that his declaration that we're independent of the Covid and masks would be his ""mission accomplished"" moment. Once again, we opened prematurely, and the CDC is no less responsible for this considering that less than 50% of the country is fully vaccinated. They were aware of Delta and the data out of the UK, which has been a precursor to the surges here. CDC should have known better. I'm not a scientist, but I could see the patterns emerging and parallels to the UK. 

When the CDC lifted the indoor masking, with no vaccine verification mechanism, I believed it was a stupid idea, given the low national vaccination rate, and precisely because I knew that unvaccinated people would continue unmasked indoors and spread the virus and infect children and other vulnerable people. Also, breakthroughs were a known potential. 

The CDC should have kept it simple, no nuanced ""under these conditions"" versus ""other conditions"", ""vaccinated"" versus ""unvaccinated"": When indoors, wear a mask. Period."
2021-07-31 04:34:11,"I looked for corroboration of these numbers from other sources, and the numbers are all the same - 70% (actually 69%) of the infected people were fully vaccinated, compared to an overall vaccination rate of 74% of the people exposed (which on its surface is jolting).  However, I found another statistic from the Boston Herald:

<a href=""https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/07/25/provincetown-officials-vote-to-order-mask-mandate-after-coronavirus-cluster-surpasses-500-cases"" target=""_blank"">https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/07/25/provincetown-officials-vote-to-order-mask-mandate-after-coronavirus-cluster-surpasses-500-cases</a>/

""The total number of cases among vaccinated people in Massachusetts remains “extremely low,” at 0.1% or 5,166 cases out of more than 4.3 million fully vaccinated residents, the DPH said.""

IMO, that is strong evidence that the Provincetown outbreak is somehow an outlier."
2021-07-31 06:29:58,"I wish these agencies gave actual numbers that they have in detail. They know what percentage of vaccinated people have been hospitalised and what age/underlying conditions they had. 

Is this vagueness & lack of details from officials intentional? 

Like most citizens, I'd like to see the actual numbers of hospitalisations and deaths among, for instance, those under 18 so that parents can make better, rational  decisions for their children and schools. 

Lack of clarity prompts either over reactions and/or rejection of warnings. Transparency breads credibility.

2021-07-31 04:48:18,"It's clear that Covid-19 keeps evolving. I'm glad the Biden administration is willing to change course when necessary, even if that means reinstating mask mandates and stronger requirements for ensuring people get vaccinated. 

The Republicans who continually endanger themselves and others by their lies about masks and vaccinations and whining that they want the ""freedom"" not to wear masks or get vaccinated shows their ignorance, selfishness and plain hubris. 

The more people who are vaccinated and wear masks, the safer we will all be."
2021-07-31 05:01:37,"It is hard to understand all the schizophrenic angst among the commenters.  There are two possibilities:
1. The vaccine works plenty well enough.  In which case, why all the hysteria? The unvaccinated are on their own.  (And for children, the risk remains lower than dying from a bullet in Chicago)
2. The vaccine doesn’t work. In which case, why all the spitting anger and looking down your nose at the unvaccinated?"
2021-07-31 10:04:41,Just to be safe we've canceled our plans to go to NYC in the fall and would advise others to do the same. We must all do our part to beat this horrible Delta / Indian variant and avoiding NYC is a sensible and small thing to ask.
2021-07-31 11:24:09,"As a layperson, I have the same goals I had in March 2020: I want to protect the people I love; slow, if not stop, the spread in my community; and protect the only pair of lungs I have. If I have to wear a mask, I'll do that. If I had to get two shots, I'd do that. If I have to take another booster shot, I'll do that. If I have to have an annual shot, I'll do that."
2021-07-31 11:29:32,"“The upshot is that what Delta does in the U.K. is not necessarily what it’s going to do in places which have more very varied vaccination,” 

Yes it is, it just will have a different timeline. 

In the U.K., symptomatic COVID-19 cases among “vaccinated” individuals have risen 40% in one week, reaching an average rate of 15,537 new infections a day being detected. 

Meanwhile, symptomatic COVID-19 cases among the unvaccinated has declined by 22% and is now at a current daily average of 17,588.

This suggests the wave among unvaccinated has peaked and that natural herd immunity has set in, while “vaccinated” individuals are actually becoming more prone to infection."
2021-07-31 12:35:51,"The real scary thing about this is, does a vaccinated person spread a stronger from of the virus and if so will the shots become an annual thing?"

If the above statements don’t get the unvaccinated off the sidelines and get the shot I’m not sure anything will."
2021-07-31 13:11:27,"People should stop saying breakthrough infections are rare. They are not especially rare and when that fact becomes undeniable, as it is rapidly becoming, this kind of coverage will provoke a reaction against vaccinations in general, which is dangerous.

When Israel opened up without masks, almost 60% fully vaccinated, almost 50% of infections were in vaccinated people. That says that the current vaccine does not offer much protection against infection against Delta. Israel restored a mask mandate literally 2 weeks after reopening without.

Then the Netherlands made the same mistake and had the EXACT SAME result, and restored a mask mandate literally 2 weeks after reopening without. 

How many times do we need to repeat this experiment before we just look the facts in the face? Masks reduce exposure dramatically. Increased exposure due to (1) the increased infectivity of Delta and (2) removal of masks is getting around the current vaccine. Mask up and roll out boosters to people over 40 or 50. 

Just look at the data from Florida. Hospitals will be overwhelmed soon."
2021-07-31 04:14:36,"Seems there is a rush to declare victory over COVID-19 because of the vaccines but we forget that vaccines were never 100% effective against Covid let alone it's mutated versions, still better to have vaccines just think this COVID-19 not fully over, seems Delta is the game changer,Spanish flu took 3 years before it burned itself out.We are just 16 months into this pathogen."
2021-07-31 06:53:50,"I know this is an American newspaper, but shouldn’t the focus of encouraging vaccination be global in nature?  Most of the world doesn’t even have access to vaccines, so more variants will keep coming, possibly far worse than the Delta variant.  I am happy for you to have an ample supply of vaccines in the US, but the patents in this pandemic make it difficult for others to get vaccines.  So many articles focus on getting US people to take vaccines when we do not have any in other countries.  While you are redoing the arguments of the 18th century, we don’t have access to vaccines to have the ability to manifest any anti-scientific attitudes. 

If people don’t want vaccines, send them overseas.  We will take them.  You don’t have to give me $100. I would gladly give you $100 for a shot."
2021-07-31 11:47:45,There was concern that the vaccine would not be effective if the recipient did not exhibit mild covid symptoms following their injection. Has breakthrough events been shown to be happening to those people who showed no reaction or is it occurring with people who did show reaction at time of injection?
2021-07-31 12:06:15,"We can't run the country based on the safety of the immune compromised. I know that's a horrible thing to say. I may become immune compromised someday, my children might. But we're not yet. Let us have a normal life."
2021-07-31 12:15:04,"I was at a doctor sponsored cooking class yesterday.  I believe I was the only one vaccinated.  The doctor was talking about the virus and the improbability of anyone in the room (most over 65 and with a history of cardiac problems) getting the virus.  One person even suggested that the unvaccinated are the cause of the variants.  She was not corrected by the doctor.  I guess that is Fox News's new blame game.  It was sickening, the misinformation I heard.  I will not be going back.

2021-07-31 12:43:48,"Start by expediting the full approval of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.  Then mandate vaccination for federal employees, including the military.  Finally provide incentives to states, cities and corporations to mandate vaccinating their employees.  The hardcore vaccine refusers won't be affected, but enough of the rest of us will be to slow the delta variant in the US.  The next killer variant will most likely come from some unvaccinated corner of the globe that American capitalism can't make a profit from and has thus forgotten about."
2021-07-31 13:03:05,"Many of the vaccinated here are disturbingly selfish.
They've got theirs. They're largely protected. While I feel no empathy for the unvaccinated by choice, a significant minority of the population is unprotected. Kids, many immunocompromised, people allergic to the vaccines available, some elderly.

Those vaccinated who only regard themselves are almost as much of a problem as the unvaccinated by choice."
2021-07-31 03:28:16,"So, not all vaccinated people have to wear masks. The problem is in areas where vaccination rates are low. Why? Because the few people who get covid post vaccine may have a viral load similar to the unvaccinated. Thus, they usually don't get really sick but they can pass it to others. Now if they pass it to another vaxxed person, not so big a deal. The chances of that happening are low anyway. But if they pass it to an unvaxxed person, especially someone living in an unvaxxed area, you  can get wildfire spread. Why does that matter? Some of these areas have 1 hospital for thousands of people. You crash that hospital then everyone there, including the vaccinated, gets hurt. 

This is a numbers game. The more vaccinated in an area the less risk."
2021-07-31 10:32:42,"As long as vaccinated people infected with Delta do not usually develop serious symptoms, we do not need lockdowns or restrictions.  Offer the vaccine to everyone and let's go full speed ahead."
2021-07-31 10:34:50,"It seems that the anger of the vaccinated towards the unvaxxed is as much about frustration that life is not going to proceed as before; and if one heedlessly goes about maskless in stores, attends large public gatherings, smokes cigarettes, eats an unhealthy diet (maintaining chronic obesity, heart disease, diabetes, etc) then the odds are that if you are basically unhealthy to begin with, and all the vaccines and booster shots will not save you from Covid.

I find it reprehensible that none of our leaders want to take on the subject of unhealthy eating as pertains to our overall national health, unhealthy food in schools and even prisons - obviously a taboo subject that they are all afraid to broach. People pay a lot of money for the junk and/or fast food they are addicted to and that is just too profitable for those suppliers in the food industry.  
When you know how to eat right you don't have cravings for snacks every couple of hours, you feel energetic and not like  you sacrificing the bad food you used to love, and your immune system works far better."
2021-07-31 11:33:35,"The unvaccinated will be ok, the virus kills much fewer than one in 200, and mostly older and those with bad immune systems. The 5 percent of vaccinated people who experience 'breakthrough' infections will be even more fine, fewer to zero deaths, most of these also are immune compromised. So, as a whole population, these risks aren't greater than other diseases in our country right now. Why would we live differently than we had before? Americans need to be more healthy when they're young. Forcing masks and fear will not do this. Get vaccinated, and help your immune system, exercise, have fun with friends, eat well and good luck!"
2021-07-31 12:14:37,"Some seem to think of the vaccine like insect repellent. It is not. It doesn’t keep the virus away, it just prepares you to deal with it when it arrives."
2021-07-31 12:22:31,"According to local reporting this outbreak was associated with Bear Week in Ptown, many thousands of men partying and “hugging” in densely packed close proximity. The epidemiological validity of extrapolating from that unique circumstance to a Kiwanis dinner in Des Moines seems dubious. But, as many comments note, it’s almost impossible to sort out what the data and basis is for the CDC’s latest change in guidance because of a frustrating lack of transparency."
2021-07-31 07:30:56,"The CDC inexplicably decided earlier that they would only track runaway infections that led to severe illness - those involving hospitalization or death. Bottom line, they simply don’t know how many fully immunized people are getting infected. Period."
2021-07-31 03:00:20,"So what's next? The vaccinated people, who believe in science and respect the challenges of the federal government to curb this pandemic, have to once again mask up in order to protect those who continue to flagrantly defy our government and their fellow citizens?  This twisted logic is  unacceptable. The time has come for the federal government to stop appeasing those who will not be vaccinated.  The public health of all citizens needs to supersede the individual rights of those who care only for themselves. If we continue down this path, the pandemic will never end. And for that, the blame goes to the selfish, misinformed  30%."
2021-07-31 08:27:39,"So I complied with the recommendations from the beginning. Isolated, then socially distanced and masked, then I became vaccinated at the first opportunity for me. The refrain from officials: do these measures to protect yourself and others until the highly effective vaccine becomes available which will be the only way to solve this. And for a time, this appeared to be true. Vaccines became available, responsible people got the vaccine, official guidelines shifted as promised to ease mask mandates and social distancing. Now the goalposts are moving again for the cdc because the virus is evolving. I now have to mask again to protect the foolish? We aren’t all in this together and never have been."
2021-07-31 12:45:11,It is worse than I expect that vaccines stop spreading. CDC may need to recommend a third booster shots and mandate for vaccine inoculation nationwide.
2021-07-31 04:13:22,"Why does everybody seem (purposely?) to leave out the very real scenario that some folks already vaxxed—both recently and not—may have already been exposed to the Covid within the about 10-14 days heretofore estimated infection timeline and, consequently, they perhaps had not been protected by their 1 or more subsequent vaxxes sufficiently? Guess doing so makes the stories and hysteria more interesting (?)…"
2021-07-31 12:38:57,"I just read 'Station Eleven', a science fiction novel written in 2014.  It was about the collapse of society after a ""flu"" infected 99% of the world's population with hours and killed them in 3 days.  It felt no so science fiction while reading it."
2021-07-31 12:40:49,Why do we continue to hear “rare breakthrough cases” when clearly it’s not rare?
2021-07-31 03:55:05,"Those anti vaxxers who are most vehemently against the shot out to be counted. Health insurance companies ought to adjust their rates accordingly. 
I got my shot as soon as I could. Lucky for me, my first dose was in late January! All these months later, they can’t even give the vaccines away with the promise of money or gifts. I’m absolutely furious at the loud, willfully ignorant right wing pundits denying the effectiveness. Those deniers are literally killing people with their words. Perhaps worse is that they’re allowing for the continued mutation of this virus. What if it makes a leap to 90% mortality? I already read that King novel, I certainly don’t want to live it."
2021-07-31 04:55:12,Why is is taking so long for the FDA to approve the Covid 19 vaccines? Where is normal Presidential leadership? Mandates are clearly required for the public health and military readiness.
2021-07-31 04:32:28,"The CDC revealed, today. 74% (346 out of 469) of the covid cases from that MA outbreak in early July were in fully vaccinated people. 26% of the covid cases were in unvaccinated people. There were five people hospitalized, 4 of those hospitalizations the fully vaccinated. Nobody died. 

Because of this incident, the CDC is recommending that vaccinated people wear masks, indoors. 

In addition, the CDC director doubled down on the “Everyone must get vaccinated, immediately!” statement. To the point where she said, the govt. might require that everyone “get the vaccine.”

This makes no sense. At all. On any level. This is a non sequitur.

If that MA outbreak shows anything it is that people should NOT get the vaccine. Why bother?"
2021-07-31 10:24:10,"Are the anti-vaxxers happy now that they've ensured another year of chaos on masking, lockdowns, ER visits, ventilators and unnecessary deaths?"
2021-07-31 04:43:47,"In 1954 I went into the Army.  Our drill sergeants at Ft. Jackson told us to line up for shots.  My arm felt like a pincushion.  And I got a bit feverish. 

Put it this way, I didn't enjoy the experience but it was  duty.  In the military you risk getting shot.  Getting a shot in your arm is nothing compared to taking a bullet (which, fortunately, never happened to me).

Headed to Guatemala as American diplomats in 1961, my wife and I got painful shots for yellow fever --shots she didn't need and I didn't until I spent a week in a  dugout on the Peten's Rio de la Pasion.  

I sympathize with vaccine hesitancy but it's time for such Americans to set aside qualms and get vaccinated for COVID.  So far as Vaccine deniers are concerned, they have become the modern equivalent of Draft Dodgers.  Please do your duty with respect to your fellow Americans and get vaccinated. 

A nation that can't make sacrifices for the common good, is not the sort of nation the U.S. once was."
2021-07-31 04:50:02,Even after getting both Pfizer shots I never stopped wearing my masks out of respect for OTHER people.  This is not rocket science.  Now I wear an N-95 mask in the stranger danger zone where we can't trust anyone.
2021-07-31 08:39:28,"Mind blowing to me that after 74 PERCENT of the cases are reported to be in the fully vaccinated, people are shouting even louder about mandates.  The words on the page say “fully vaccinated people transmit the disease just as the unvaccinated do”. Get it?  It might prevent severe disease and i am personally glad I got my vaccine for that reason but the evidence for a MANDATE (to prevent spread) is SHATTERED.   Gone.  This is not “breakthrough” this is 74 percent… a total failure to prevent spread via vaccination.  Total. You cannot claim to be on the side of science and ignore the evidence.   That’s just not allowed. Even the scientists and doctors are “completely mystified”. What’s worse is this: the vaccine renders many symptom free.  They don’t know they have a high viral load.  So they are going to intermingle with their neighbors when they otherwise would have stayed home.  Back to the drawing board folks.  Face reality."
2021-07-31 09:13:29,I doubt breakthrough cases are as rare as they want us to believe.
2021-07-31 11:24:48,"It’s nice to see the CDC fully eschewing the scientific method (formerly known as “the science” but since displaced by correlation and conjecture) and basing a massive population-wide treatment recommendation on a 470 person cluster. The public is not as foolish as one might think, though readers apparently are."
2021-07-31 12:56:14,These Trump vaccines are not as good as he claimed when he developed them with Warp Speed.  Biden was right to be wary of the Trump vaccines.  Trump always exaggerates his the worth of this products and services.
2021-07-31 00:45:04,"It is time, past time, to mandate the vaccine for everyone. 

Too bad that it infringes to a degree on some people's personal liberty. 

Mandates for the public good date back to General George Washington when he called for mandatory small pox immunizations for his troops in the Revolutionary War, even though at the time “variolation” was risky."
2021-07-30 22:31:36,"From the article, ""and infections in vaccinated people are thought to be comparatively rare.""
It hen goes on to say, "" Three-quarters of the people infected in Provincetown reported having a cough, headache, sore throat or fever — symptoms of an infection in the upper airway — and 74 percent were known to be fully immunized.""
Not sure about the writers at the Times, but a 74% infection rate of immunized people seems way higher than ""comparatively rare.""
If I were to describe it, I would  all it a five alarm fire!"
2021-07-30 19:12:22,Thoughts and Prayers to those who refuse to get the vaccine.
2021-07-28 13:53:19,"This article lacks context. South Korea is experiencing a surge but if you compare South Korea’s daily infection rates to the US and Europe, you see that South Korea’s worst days are in line with the best days in the US and Europe. The decision not to order more vaccines seems ill-advised but even with a limited supply, South Korea has avoided the worst of the pandemic. Same is true for Japan. Countries that have effectively instituted mitigation strategies have done far better than those who ordered a surplus of vaccines."
2021-07-28 14:46:38,"Covid cases are still relatively low in Korea compared to most countries in the world. Yes, Korea needs the vaccines but is the government to blame that other countries around the world are more desperate for it? Especially when one country is controlling the vaccine output to the world?

FYI - as of yesterday, Covid deaths in Korea was 2,083 in a country that has over 51 mil people. In Los Angeles County - as of yesterday, there were 24,643 deaths in a population of 10 mil. 

Vaccination is the only way out of this pandemic, but countries that required masks early on were able to control the outbreak. More reasons to keep wearing masks until over 70% of the population is vaccinated."
2021-07-28 15:45:36,"That has not been the only problem.  I managed to my first shot of AstraZeneca by obsessively following for unfulfilled vaccinations.  I found a Korean website for clinics with left-over vaccines, only to see that program get shut down after telling others about it.  Some Koreans were spooked by the side effects of Astrazeneca.  The system for vaccines changed to being based on internet communication services provided by Naver and Kakao to find vaccines.  People have been taking all day off to find vaccines.  The system is too primitive to handle the requests and/or people are using bots to grab appointments in microseconds as they open.

Also, contract tracing has not been the only approach.  When some factory workers got Covid-19 in Yongin, every foreigner in Gyeonggido and Jeollanamdo (hours away and with single digit rates until recently) had to suddenly get a Covid-19 test by the end of the week or face fines in the thousands in US currency.   The policy would have been the same in Seoul if not for embassy protests.  I don’t know any other country who has based testing on ethnic nationalism.  This is the same parochial ethnic nationalism which led to MBC’s Olympic coverage.

Lots of scapegoating for failures of churches, foreigners, and now often younger people,etc. for the government failures and inequitable global distribution of vaccines.  At the end of the day, the government has to acknowledge they should not have started to open up before they secured vaccines."
2021-07-28 17:06:09,"New Zealand too has had difficulty sourcing vaccines in large numbers until recent weeks when the situation improved somewhat. As we don't currently have covid in the community (although there are cases most days among overseas arrivals in quarantine) the government prioritised use of scarce supplies for border workers and healthcare workers earlier in the year, and then the over 65's or people with health vulnerabilities. Until Delta got out of control in NSW Australia, this hadn't seemed too much of an issue. Bookings for the broader community (but with over 60's being given priority) opened yesterday, July 28. I'm 70 so mindful of this looming roadblock - and, worryingly, not yet having received an invitation to make a booking - I tried to make a booking online last week. As I live in a rural area in the top of the South Island I tried to get a booking at any of the nearest four towns that had vaccination centres, only to receive messages saying there were no bookings available within 75 kms of any of them and a suggestion that I ring the 0800 number. Like many New Zealanders I have had unhappy experiences with ringing government 0800 numbers so I didn't bother. Then yesterday I finally received my text invitation to book - either online or by ringing yet another 0800 number.  I tried online. Same result. Irked I rang the 0800 number. A recorded message invited me to leave my name and number. Someone rang back within hours and -to my great surprise offered me a slot today!"
2021-07-28 21:21:43,I have waited longer than that to get to speak with a person on the United Airlines number.
2021-07-28 22:11:51,"Sounds very similar to the current situation in Australia, except we’ve got an additional layer of vaccine hesitancy. 

Many Australians are unwilling to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, even in older age groups where the risks of covid clearly outweigh the risk of blood clots. But with very limited supplies of Pfizer being the only alternative, it will be the end of the year before there’s enough for everyone to get vaccinated."
2021-07-28 23:47:10,"As a guy who lived in Korea until the past month, I'm not even sure whether the country has the vaccines that the government said to have claimed. I bet there's no difference between China and Korea. The media is flawed and the government is seriously corrupted."
2021-07-30 00:14:12,I work for the Veterans Health Administration We are REQUIRED to get a flu shot every year. Schools and colleges routinely require vaccination as a condition of attendance. So it’s not true that government never requires that people undergo medical procedures as part of employment or attendance. I work at the Seattle VA where 95  percent of employees are already vaccinated.
2021-07-30 00:10:05,"Good. It’s absolutely astonishing how America has dumbed down its schools to the point that people don’t understand basic science. I wish the fact that millions of people are so epically ignorant would encourage funding our schools. 
People who won’t get vaccinated shouldn’t even be allowed to drive cars."
2021-07-30 00:09:20,"The pandemic is largely over for the vaccinated. As far as I am concerned, we should get to an approval for vaccinating children ASAP and let the rest of the unvaccinated meet the consequences of their ignorance."
2021-07-30 00:11:56,"Yes, they should expect inconveniences.

Vaccine refusal has proven highly inconvenient to a functioning society."

2021-07-30 00:15:17,"To the three republican senators who are asking for more scientific evidence of the vaccine, how many more people are you willing to sacrifice for politics? Another sad truth is this current surge is mostly on red states, for the sake of your own constituents, stop pretending you are a group of ignorant fools."
2021-07-30 00:17:45,"""If you’re out there unvaccinated, you don’t have to die. Read the news.”  Biden needs to direct the CDC to be more proactive.  Public Service Announcements on television.  Show families who have lost loved ones to the Delta variant.  Make it REAL."
2021-07-30 00:13:27,"Yesterday on a flight from the west coast I sat next to a wheezing, coughing, sniffling young man who said it was “inconvenient” for him to get a vaccination.

I fully support the President’s call for the unvaccinated to truly suffer inconveniences."
2021-07-30 00:15:58,"The Biden administration made a mistake not setting the standards and creating the infrastructure for vaccine “passports”.  The cute little cards we were given are too easy to fake and too easy to lose. As more and more businesses, governments, and institutions require vaccines, how will vaccination status be verified?"
2021-07-30 00:17:54,"I will no longer spend anytime trying to convince anyone to take the Covid vaccine. My ER is filled beyond capacity by Covid patients. As of last night we had 52 admits in our 43 bed ER, someone have been in ER for 100 hours plus. 
I, however went out today and snagged a Pfizer booster shot. 
I tell whoever asks, I would rather die of Covid vaccine “overdose” than to die of Covid virus."

2021-07-30 00:21:34,"What is civil rights?
Do I have a right to stay alive? Yes.
Do I have a right to kill someone else? No.
Does the Government have a responsibility for keeping me safe? Yes.
And to answer the first question, civil rights is the right to do what you want as long as it does not harm others. Knowingly carrying a lethal weapon without taking precautions that it does not harms others is NOT a civil right. The penal code treats this anywhere from reckless endangerment (a felony) to first degree murder (another felony). Those claiming ""civil rights"" should take a pause, think about what civil rights is, and be happy that the government is not getting serious about tracking the viral transmissions and start prosecuting the penal code."
2021-07-30 00:22:06,"And another article in The New York Times states that those who are vaccinated, and are ""loaded"" with the Delta variant, may be just as contagious as unvaccinated people.  Think how many Americans might be bringing this home to their unvaccinated grandparents?"
2021-07-30 00:22:35,it is nice to have a grownup in charge of the country again.
2021-07-30 00:34:01,"I can't believe we as a country have to pay people $100 to take a life saving vaccine.  I honestly fear for the future of this country.  

As a Federal Employee, I think forcing people to get the vaccine is a great idea but also know it will be a disaster.  Almost every Federal Employee outside of the Postal Service and Law Enforcement have been Teleworking 100 percent since March, 2020.  Are they going to test the unvaccinated who have been working form home for the last 16 months?  Having seen the insanity of the bureaucracy for many years, they will probably give paid administrative leave to those currently working from home, who refuse to get vaccinated."
2021-07-30 00:35:14,"During the election Mr. Biden indicated he would follow the scientists.  The scientists , however, are reacting to data,  It is clear that if we do not get ahead of the data, this will go on forever.  Getting ahead of the data requires proactive leadership based on informed decisions.  Finally.   Bravo, Mr. President.  Too bad the former president could not figure out how to do the same.

Why hasn't the NYT required vaccinations of its employees?"
2021-07-30 00:32:28,Any idea when they will be “fully” approved??  “Experimental” just doesnt sit right. I believe once that happens the people will gladly do it. And you can have your way of using all that bought product you are trying to shove onto peoples freedoms.

2021-07-30 00:36:50,Teachers against vaccines? Could somebody explain it?
2021-07-30 00:39:22,"Of course, no politician in our lifetimes lied without a shred of conscience like Donald Trump. But Joe Biden, a career politician, is a practitioner par excellence of the politician‘ s favored way of  “spinning” the facts commonly known as “gilding the lily.” He was very frank in his speech but overstated the efficacy of vaccines, downplayed the need for mask mandates and did not provide the sober warning about the seriousness of the Delta variant.(see Washington Post tonight). 
Yes, he is trying to sell the importance of vaccination; and he has taken strong and appropriate steps to protect the Federal workforce and urged states and private business to make similar vaccine or testing protocols.
I think Biden should have stated the policies he would be implementing and that the economic recovery and health of millions was at stake; but Dr.  Walensky should have explained the medical facts, stressing what is known but also what is still being studied and the facts about vaccines and masking, efficacy and deficiencies.
There are anti-vaxxers and Trump deluded conspiracy nuts; but there are those who are hesitant for what they believe are rational concerns. The apparent inconsistency between Biden’s spinning the certainty that vaccines prevent sickness,  and the reality that is being discovered (see WAPO) only reinforces doubt and confusion. 
Trump tried to create alternative facts ; Covid had none that. Biden must confront this fact: the unvarnished truth must be communicated."
2021-07-30 00:23:00,Why not $100 to everyone that has been vaccinated by Aug 6 (including all of us that have been vaccinated for months)?

2021-07-30 00:34:04,"Restrictions and requirements should have been set in place long long ago. Friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers of the adamantly unvaccinated (lacking a medical reason) should have been shunning them openly.

2021-07-30 00:26:55,"The notion that vaccinations are optional and that people's ""freedoms and liberty"" shouldn't be infringed upon by suggesting mandatory shots is Republicanism on steroids are proof that Evangelicalism, Trumpism and poor public education are decimating America.

The ignorant have the power to continue infecting the US with Delta and whatever comes after that, and that's unacceptable to 85 million Biden voters.

That the Republicans are afraid to push vaccinations on their low-education, low-information, conspiracy believing, Fox News hypnotized, Kool Aid drunk voters out of fear of losing their votes is repulsive, venal and no longer acceptable to the majority of Americans."

We needed the vaccine to get rid of masks, now we have to wear them anyway.

2021-07-30 00:43:02,It’s time to stop kowtowing to people who are holding us back as a society. It’s not okay to endanger others by refusing to be vaccinated; it’s not okay to lie for political gain; it’s crazy to live demanding that others respect our need to live in an alternative reality where truth doesn’t matter. I’m hoping that this pitch by government and businesses at various levels to demand some measure of social responsibility during this worldwide crisis will start to push us in a new direction. One can hope: change has to begin somewhere. At least it should help to get COVID under control in this country. Perhaps then we’d have more will to take a leadership role in getting this thing under control around the world. Nobody is really safe during this pandemic until we’re all safe.

These idiots somehow have failed to realize the 600,000 Americans are dead from this virus and their irresponsible behavior will only add to that number.

The “inconvenience” of having to get a vaccine is nothing compared with the inconvenience of having another virus variant—caused by unvaccinated people allowing the virus more chances to mutate. The Delta variant is far more contagious and can sometimes infect vaccinated people—and even though vaccinated people are unlikely to get very sick, there are still cases where a mild breakthrough case can cause long Covid. The next variant could escape our antibodies, be better at killing children, or have a much higher fatality rate. Now that would be inconvenient."

How come the NYT isn’t pushing that as well as vaccinations?

Is it the NYT “It’s the economy” let’s be stupid? From the 1990’s?

Is it an unwillingness to actually state the problem? 

Putting willingly unvaccinated and unmasked people as just “at risk” as though they are the same as the immunocompromised, or young children who can’t?

I know the NYT hates passing judgement but how about addressing reality?"
2021-07-30 01:37:02,"The Left has to get out of the game of trying to save people from themselves. 

The vaccinated people shouldn’t be thrown into any restrictions. 

What should happen is that businesses and restaurants should be able to set up operating hours or sections for vaccinated people that  live or work with children or those with immune system issues. 

Nothing can be done to convince unvaccinated adults. A mandate is impossible and will lead to unbridled violence. The only thing that will improve vaccine rates are death and hospitalization. 

Just shovel more money to the pharma company ones so that they can rapidly respond to the inevitable variants that will spill out of the south, Midwest and our poor urban centers."

Better idea, rely on the traditional approach- this would be a preexisting for a non-vaccinated person-woooo hoooo for the insurance company or the uninsured fund and push them out into the street unless they can pay all hospital costs.

2021-07-30 01:19:35,"Been waiting for the chance to applaud Biden on his – and his staff’s – approach to increasing the percentage vaccinated:

1st, straightforward encouragement of a reachable goal – similar to encouraging the faculty at a HS to increase their school’s graduation rate – calls attention to the existing state of things without judging it, and reinforces the significance of a straightforward metric

2nd, a modest financial incentive.  This move will provide deep quantitative insight into the psychology of dissent reinforced by echo-chambering.  While it’d be more laudable if this got us from 60% vaccinated to 90% – vs, say, just 65% – it will give (all of) us a sense of the median depth of individual dissent

What’d further improve things – but here in the US, corporate dissenters are citizen dissenters, too, though with better lawyers – is if Joe could encourage those offering back-generation vaccine technology to stand down, as did Merck.  

To put a finer point on it, the hit-or-miss efficacy of back-generation flu vaccines irked me to eschew.  On the other hand, the day Moderna/Pfizer described what they were doing, started angling for a place in line.  To be crass, had speculated that opportunity would arise early, because of others’ skepticism.  Turned out true

b. $50
c. $100

Just wow. Thank goodness people didn't think like this during WWII, otherwise we would all probably be doing the goose step now. We seem to be at the mercy of individuals who are blackmailing us to give them stuff for free, or else. Think of the landlords who haven't collected rent for months from at times violent and threatening tenants who aren't even unemployed, or the homeless in NYC who refuse vaccinations so they don't have to vacate hotels (but miraculously have money for pot, but not for food), to the willfully unvaccinated who now need to be paid off. We're literally being held hostage to an underclass of ruthless and selfish individuals who refuse to be citizens.  For those of us who haven't seen a cent of stimulus cheques, and pay more than half of salary in taxes, I think enough is enough. Outside the US, this just makes us look weak, greedy and selfish."

Unvaccinated people are ruining our chances for recovery, and I'm not sure that I'm willing to get another shot because of their stubborness and stupidity. I have left my home only to attend medical appointments that require me to be at the clinic for the last 18 months. Either mandate the damn vaccines or give it up already. I'm not willing to be a prisoner in my own home any longer while the unvaccinated refuse to do what they need to do to end this nightmare."
2021-07-30 01:44:06,"It took a long time and probably required a lot of high priced help, but the President seems to have come up with a real loser of a policy idea.

I hope that a better Plan B is announced soon to replace this plan."

2021-07-30 01:48:09,"This republican-fueled resistance to safety measures, including vaccination, masking, etc. is endangering all of us. And it galls me that we are asked to pay $100 to each person who gets the vaccine when many of them have intentionally delayed and helped the virus spike.  If incentive is needed, we should refuse to pay for the medical treatment of anyone who has been eligible for the vaccine and has refused. Their insurance should not cover Covid-19 related health issues.

The distractors may not understand how dangerous it is when a COVID variant, delta, is as contagious as chickenpox, but he clearly gets it. The world has given over three billion (with a “b”) shots and he knows isn’t yet enough. Not enough data to get a vaccine? Seriously?

Given over six hundred thousand deaths in the US alone perhaps those making money off of COVID disinformation ought to be held to account. Yes, I believe in free of speech, but I believe in consequences for my actions too. I'm not a Trumpian-always-play-the-victim-child."

This, despite speeding a useless Alzheimer’s drug that major health systems refuse to use. ALL Covid-related anger in this country should be aimed at two camps: the unvaccinated and the FDA.

They’re especially inconveniencing and taking away the liberties of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities, people who are immunocompromised from autoimmune disorders and organ transplants, as well as cancer survivors. I deserve my liberty, too. I want the pandemic to be over. I want to be able to go to my many doctor’s appointments knowing that all healthcare providers are vaccinated to protect vulnerable patients. They are keeping the pandemic alive and helping the virus mutate. Enough already. I’m happy that the federal government is putting the inconvenience of being unvaccinated on those who have chosen not to be vaccinated. I wish the federal government would go further. Make it impossible to use public transportation, public restrooms, public spaces, or work in healthcare or long term care facilities or prisons without being vaccinated.

God, if you're reading the NYT comments section, please tell these people to vax up. You wouldn't want to meet these folks anytime soon anyways. You'll thank me later bud."
2021-07-30 02:08:33,"Good for President Biden, and I am pleased to see some private sector companies getting more serious about mandating vaccinations among employees.  It's about time we stop playing patty cake with the anti-vax crowd.

The best approach is making vaccinations a condition of employment.  Next best is ""you can go unvaccinated if you want, but you're going to wear a mask at all times and get tested weekly at your own expense, and forget about using the cafeteria or attending a meeting in a conference room or taking a business trip.""

I also wouldn't mind denying paid sick leave to unvaccinated persons who fall ill from COVID, and I'd like to see insurance companies deny coverage to the unvaccinated for treatment of COVID.

In anticipation of a common ""whatabout"" rebuttal, appropriate accommodations would be made for those who have bona fide, legitimate medical reasons for declining vaccination."

The 27-Nation EU with double the population of the US & a fraction of US Resources has More vaccinations per 100,000 people than the US. The EU never engaged in US-style hyperbole of ‘Warpspeed’ or even the huge incentive of $1million prizes for vaccination. Right from Jan,2020 - for last 19 months - EU Media highlighted Facts of the Pandemic & emphasised the Public Safety behaviours needed to beat the Pandemic. Unlike US Media which constantly ballooned & promoted Trump’s Lies to Deny the Pandemic & Trash all Public Safety behaviours as an ‘assault’ on Freedom !! And unlike EU Media frontpaging German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s anguished cry at the Bundestag ‘We cannot accept 500 German dying a day from this Virus’, US Media joined Trump in hiding & downplaying the rising deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Over last 19 months, US Media has been complicit in turning the US into the World’s prime model of Worst Governance & National Dysfunction. Surely the US can do better. Surely US Media can shift tracks & serve Democracy better. The World hopes so. The World needs it."
2021-07-30 02:18:06,"Do the testing necessary to have the FDA approve the vaccine and end the emergency approval. In my opinion the emergency is over at this point.

2021-07-30 02:20:31,"“Operation Warp Speed (OWS) was a public–private partnership initiated by the United States government to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. The first news report of Operation Warp Speed was on April 29, 2020, and the program was officially announced on May 15, 2020. It was headed by Moncef Slaoui from May 2020 to January 2021 and by David A. Kessler from January to February 2021. At the end of February 2021, Operation Warp Speed was transferred into the responsibilities of the White House COVID-19 Response Team.” -Wikipedia 

So, President Trump initiated the shots in the arms ASAP strategy in response to the pandemic.

President Biden is continuing that effort.

Yet, somehow red states are reluctant to vaccinate. Is fighting this pandemic political?

2021-07-30 02:26:26,"No one can keep you healthy but yourself.  

Here is some info on masks that can really protect the wearer.  
All advanced counties produce an anti-viral masks (which are also called respirators), designed to protect health care workers in Covid ICUs.   

The N95, made in the US, are the only mask approved by the FDA.  The downside is the higher cost and discomfort.  Many people find them hard to breathe through.

Two other widely available masks are the KN95 and KF94.
The KN95 is made in China.  Until 7/1/2021 the FDA authorized some KN95s for use in health care settings in the USA, because of the shortage of N95.  This mask is less thick than the N95 and much easier to breathe through.  They are also a fraction of the cost.
The KF94 is made in South Korea and tested by their government.  It shares the advantages of the Chinese mask: easier to breathe through and less expensive.

I want to stress that all three masks have been battled-tested in Covid-care settings.  All three masks are sturdy and reusable in the light virus context of the supermarket.  If you regard your office as a heavy virus context, you can disinfect by placing the mask in a sealed paper bag for three days and then discarding after five uses.

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.
I think, therefore I mask."
2021-07-30 02:27:59,"I’ve had it with these people. It’s time to start mandating vaccination for schools, places of employment, public transit, and public activities. That’s the only thing that’s going to work now. If you have a public-facing job, you should be vaccinated. If you work in healthcare or education, you should be vaccinated or find other employment. Barring legitimate, documented medical reasons, everyone should be vaccinated. If we’re all vaccinated, we protect those who cannot be, including children under 12. If we’re all vaccinated, we can stop this thing in its tracks, at least in this country, and then help the rest of the world get back on its feet.

I don’t want to hear anyone warble about “my body, my choice”; it’s not your choice when the choice you’re making can sicken and kill other people. You do not have the right to make me ill. You do not have the right to kill me. And yes, I’ve been vaccinated, but Delta is zooming all over everywhere and all it’s going to take is one particularly malevolent variant, brought to mutated fruition by the flagrantly and flippantly unvaccinated, to render the vaccines useless and send us all back to March 2020.

I spent the last year living in fear. I masked up, I social distanced, I limited my activities, I spent a holiday alone in the name of safety, I went in to work terrified because I didn’t have the option of working from home. I got vaccinated as soon as I could. I did, and am still doing, my part. These people must now do theirs."

It baffles me that this is not more widely understood. If the powers that be and society more broadly had approached the pandemic with more humility, less intrusively and an ask vs. tell approach, we’d have a much much higher vaccination rate. I think that is a legitimate and honest take that warrants consideration."

When the pandemic first started, I spend 15 months in my house. Now that I've been vaccinated, I've been able to leave the house, hug my kids, go shopping, run my errands, even travel.

But because of these selfish people, the delta variant is taking hold and undoing all the work and sacrifices the rest of us made.

And what about those of us who can't be vaccinated? People who are immuno-compromised because they're undergoing chemo? Or are taking immunosuppressants? Or who have autoimmune disease? Children under 12?

It's time for them to pay the price--no admittance to public spaces without proof of vaccination, period. Of course exceptions can be made for people with legitimate medical reasons for not getting vaxxed--they can wear a mask. Politicians of both parties have to stop pandering to them--they are a danger to the public and must be controlled as any other threat would."
2021-07-30 03:08:45,"Several thoughts to ponder about coercing administration of the corona virus vaccines now:
1.  The vaccines saved thousands of lives last winter and spring, but at present, the delta virus death rate is near zero;
2.  The CDC estimates that over 100 million people have recovered from the original Wuhan corona virus, and are now immune-- should they be vaccinated?
3.   Almost a million people have crossed into the US illegally in 2021, and many have the virus--what to do about them?"
2021-07-30 03:46:11,Huh. A hundred bucks for science deniers and selfish hard heads? And here I went and got vaxxed because it’s good for me and my community. Where’s my reward? I could sure use it. My SNAP benefits went from $200 to $19. No worry though. Governor DeathSantis isn’t going to want to incentivize vaccines.
2021-07-30 03:11:07,"It is high time that the police power of the state be invoked via the case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), to require that all Americans get vaccinated against the Coronavirus pandemic, whether they wish to do so, or not.

That case was about a guy from Boston who didn’t want the smallpox vaccine. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he had to do so, because he lived in a big city, and therefore he must contribute to overall herd immunity.

Over a century later, the United States is NOT on track to reach herd immunity via vaccine.

Despite having a competent President of the United States who is a good person – complete with a law degree – who has quickly and efficiently gotten the vaccines out to the general public, far too many Americans are not getting vaccinated.

Why?!

Religion?! That exists to give people who need it comfort when science has nothing better to offer. Otherwise, there is science.

Freedom?! Liberty?! We have plenty of that. Nevertheless they rail that we don’t have enough, riot in the U.S. Capitol and join hate groups to cause more trouble, and the wealthy ones fund economic libertarian groups to buy out GOP politicians.

They don’t like reality, so they fight reasonable precautions such as masks and rail against vaccines.

We have enough liberty in the United States already, and enough bills to pay. The government has already made the vaccine free of cost."

Give health insurance  premium rebates to the vaccinated
or charge higher health insurance premiums to the unvaccinated 
We can also increase the deductible for the unvaccinated.
Presently , in the absence of an active COVID infection those who refuse vaccination have little downside to themselves although they may transmit the illness to others during their asymptomatic period. Having some negative consequences for the anti vaxxers to remain unvaccinated places some of the onus of not being vaccinated on those who decide not to protect them selves and their fellow Americans"

I’ll never understand how dogs didn’t make it to the top of the hierarchy. Dogs wouldn’t refuse vaccinations. Dogs would get vaccinated and then carry around a basket of vaccinations to everyone else (without having to be asked). Wouldn’t have to pay them $100 either. They’d accept payment in belly rubs and treats.

Seriously sometimes I do think about how much better this planet would be without humans. We are the worst."

2021-07-30 03:27:26,"So here’s another question: is our current rush to get unvaccinated people vaccinated, going to backfire on us? Delta is spreading quickly, and it takes two shots, and at least 5 weeks (with Pfizer) to achieve immunity. 

In the meantime, half-vaccinated people are not merely vulnerable to Delta; they are providing the perfect medium in which Delta can learn to defeat the vaccine (which will be weaker and producing fewer antibodies).mThen we will have a Delta that evades the present vaccines; an even more lethal, contagious, “smart” Delta. 

We can call it Omega - i.e., “The End.” 

I’m not suggesting that we let people die; but we need to think through what we are doing. We need a protective strategy that takes into account the ability of a virus to evolve. Will exposing the virus to hundreds of thousands of people with a single shot of Pfizer or Moderna, enable the virus to learn how to defeat those vaccines?"
2021-07-30 03:55:02,"Biden needs to manage this pandemic much more on a global as well as national scale. Even if Americans achieve 100 percent vaccination, if the rest of the world is not as comprehensively vaccinated, the Coronavirus will continue to mutate and develop variants that could eventually breakthrough our achieved/acquired immunities. 

Consider a national borders quarantine and building vaccine manufacturing in third world countries as serious responses/tactics. A variant could develop that causes significant mortality in young healthy people as occurred in the 2nd wave of the 1918 Flu Pandemic."

A month later, with cases doubling, he is offered the Moderna vaccine, but again he declines and repeats “God will save me”. Having a podcast, the preacher has Dr. Fauci on and the doctor instructs him to get the vaccine but he remains stubbornly sure that “God will save me.” When he dies of Covid, several weeks later, he meets God and asks “God why didn’t you save me?” to which God replies “What are you talking about, I sent you two vaccines and a Fauci!”"

We had round two.  And people died and the economy suffered.

And now we have round four which we should not be having because we have a vaccine.  More people are dying and we are going back once again to masks and social distancing.
And soon we we have round five with a more dangerous virus and more people will die.

Di Blasio keeps boasting that there was low transmission last year. Well, that's because most students and teachers were remote. Only 30% of students were actually in person. So, of course there was low transmission. And yet, my school closed almost every other week due to cases.

I don't understand this childish refusal. All these whiners that claim their civil liberties are being violated were required to have certain vaccines when we entered public school in order to avoid the spread of contagious disease. And they had to vaccinate their children when they entered public school. Otherwise, we'd still be in danger of contracting polio, small pox, and other deadly diseases. 

Stop trying to encourage and ""negotiate."" We're at war in a public health emergency. We're mandated to wear seat belts, stop at a red light, adhere to speed limits as public health measures.

Now because of the people who refuse to get vaccinated and the resulting increasing rates of Covid, it looks like the staff and students at my school will have to continue to wear masks when we return to school in mid August.

I am outraged. Wearing a mask is hot and bothersome and the children, especially those with special needs, have a harder time understanding words spoken.

Yet these people, if they do get vaccinated now, will receive $100?

If I didn't trust vaccines or pharmaceutical companies, though, the last thing I would want would be the government forcing me to pollute my body against my will.

I do think that pharmaceutical companies (not necessarily the ones making the Covid-19 vaccines, but that's largely irrelevant) have given us reason to not trust them. Moreover, given the great speed at which the vaccines were developed, I can understand that people might suspect that corners were cut somewhere. I find it hard to blame those who are skeptical. 

There's wisdom in the Biden approach to make people want to get vaccinated rather than to make people get vaccinated. Forcing them would likely destroy any remaining trust in the government that those people might have had.

At a certain point, though, Biden may have to assess whether maintaining that remaining trust in the long term (to call upon when addressing an even bigger crisis -- like, say, climate change) is worth the lives that could be lost in the short term.

It seems like the best solution is for the FDA to approve the vaccines for realsies. Any information on the timeline for that?"

I took their FREE online course to get some idea of how Sars CoV-2 works and I still wear my mask in indoor spaces, I still elbow connect, and I still get  updates from Johns Hopkins. They have more scientists in labs conferring with scientists across the globe watching as the virus survives without any prejudice.

To participate in the Olympics, Sunisa had to abide by the regulations of Tokyo's Olympic Committee who are facing incredible hurdles in trying to contain the pandemic. Sunisa is the hope not just for gymnastics but for the future.

For those who believe hearsay over the research, always remember that the former guy even though hospitalized with Covid-19, has been vaccinated. Some just are slow on the uptake.

The Federal Government already forces states to set a minimum age for purchase of tobacco and prohibit smoking in areas like schools. There is no reason that it can't do the same thing for Covid.

There are lots of possibilities: 

Tax businesses that don't have a vaccine mandate. Require vaccination or evidence of testing for interstate travel. Offer a national vaccine passport. Cut taxes for the vaccinated and increase them for those who aren't.

Reduce funding for states that don't require vaccination or tests in theaters, stadiums, restaurants, gyms, and public transportation.

Eliminate funding for schools that don't require vaccination. Require that hospitals and nursing homes that receive federal funding like Medicaid and Medicare.

With non life threatening areas, non covid shot people should have restrictions put on them."
2021-07-30 11:39:38,"There are two problems with Biden's plan:

(1) Once a week testing is inadequate.  Someone could pass a test, get infected later the same day, then spend the entire week spreading the disease throughout his workplace.

(2) This plan assumes people are honest.  Many anti-vaxxers will probably lie about having been vaccinated, to avoid the inconvenience of testing and being forced to wear masks at their jobs.  

This plan is better than nothing.  But it is too little too late.  The US needs a national registry (for showing proof of vaccination) and required vaccinations for everyone, with only a small number of medical exceptions allowed.  Also require all children to be vaccinated, regardless of their parent's alleged religious beliefs."
2021-07-30 11:45:30,Let's try this one for size.  Biden mandates that all airline passengers 12 years and older must be fully vaccinated.  The last dose has to be at least 12 days prior to the flight.  TSA will verify the vaccination card.  This also includes all airline employees.
2021-07-30 11:44:52,"So if people who need to be bribed to get vaccinated get $100, what do those of us who got vaccinated willingly get?  $500?  Plus, bribing people to do the right thing creates a perverse incentive to hold out for an incentive in the future if further vaccinations are needed."

The country is being taken down by idiots, but of course this too, is far from breaking news."

The unvaccinated do not want to be vaccinated and unless you physically force them be holding them down and giving them shots, they will not get vaccinated. The smart money is paying attention to the group who do wishes to be vaccinated and have already gotten vaccinated. Now that the people who received vaccinations 6 months ago have waning anti-bodies, we should be focusing on using our supply of vaccine to give those people booster shots or third shots which the manufacturers say is recommended in most cases and actually a necessity to the population that is most vulnerable. Instead, the FDA and the CDC is not cooperating with what the manufacturers recommend which is the science. Please wake up FDA and CDC and let those who need or want booster, or third shots get them. The vaccine is readily available now. however, you choose to ignore what should be done now and as usual have your focus misplaced or a back to your old ways of foot dragging."
2021-07-30 12:24:49,"To every eligible but still-unvaxed American complaining about being discriminated against because you're unvaccinated...
You don't understand discrimination!

Discrimination would be if a vaccine were available and you were denied access. But that's not the case. 

The vaccine is universally available to everyone over 12, and you're opting not to take it. So you're MAKING YOURSELF second-class by voluntarily continuing to be a prime target for infection and a vector of contagion to others.

You want access to all the workplaces, restaurants, theaters, etc. that won't risk the health and welfare of its employees and patrons by allowing unvaccinated people in? Get vaccinated. You want the good will of your friends and neighbors? Get vaccinated.

It's safe, effective, convenient and FREE. You can sign up at the nearest pharmacy. You can even choose between an mRNA product and a more conventional delivery system. 

YOU can safeguard your health and that of your loved ones, help the exhausted healthcare pros by staying out of the hospital, contribute to the effort to end Covid in the U.S., and become part of the solution. But if you choose to remain part of the problem, please don't complain that you're discriminated against because you're discriminating against yourself."

2021-07-30 12:59:19,"Instead of giving away Megamillions size prizes to a few people who refused to get vaccinated, they should be giving away stimulus-size prizes by the thousands, equally to folx who got vaccinated as soon as they could, before everyone was eligible, and to those who got vaccinated afterwards. Or save that money to pay the bills of all those who are straining our healthcare system now, and to reward the lowest level, most essential healthcare workers who are working under duress once again.

And yes, make vaccinations mandatory for all healthcare workers with stringent exceptions for religious and health exemptions only. Weekly or daily testing will expose infections too late to protect anyone, and if health care and personal care workers refuse vaccination, time to find another profession.

People who resisted this public health measure, and who continue to resist, costing their communities innocent lives and infecting the vulnerable with an illness that is disabling for many over the long haul, while straining our healthcare system and its workers and endangering others who need critical care, should not be rewarded while those of us who have done our part are left out in the cold.

Everyone needs to mask up again.

Vaccination alone is not enough against Delta, breakthroughs are now proven to be common and mild and asymptomatic infections frequently lead to long haul COVID, which is debilitating for patients, destroying livelihoods, and costing even more long term."

2021-07-30 13:44:22,"Instead of incentives for irrational people I think those of us who vaccinated should be the ones who get rewarded.

I’ve had skin cancer taken off forehead two years ago, no problem. Also was in hospital Dec 6 to Dec 10 with C19 and Pneumonia. Two months recovery to normal.

It is the equivalent of him saying, “It never occurred to me that after decades at the head of a party that has denied and demeaned scientific evidence, that we have a populace who refuses to accept the overwhelming evidence of vaccine efficacy”.

No what needs to be done is the introduction of a Vaccine Passport that  people will be required to show in order to travel, eat in doors, attend concerts, plays , movies, etc. 
The Government needs to push back hard on those who push back against the vaccine. Make their daily life so uncomfortable that they will get over what they see as  'their' precious  civil 
rights . 
The rights of every American to not get sick and die is more important."
2021-07-30 13:56:22,A large percentage of those who are unvaccinated are selfish. The best way to reach these people is by making their lives a little less comfortable. Appeal to their motivations.
2021-07-30 14:01:02,"One point I never see mentioned in any recent covid articles is how the majority of Federal Government employees are still sitting at home and getting paid.  Many of the thousands of Federal jobs are in the customer service and customer support field, the performance of which can not be completed remotely from home.  
So, you have thousands of Federal employees sitting at home and getting paid for doing absolutely nothing... for 18 months and counting.  

Now, roughly 40% of these same employees refuse to get vaccinated, and yet they are still allowed to keep their job, remain at home, complete no work,  and get paid.   For personal health and safety?  No. They have a good deal and do not want it to ever end.  

Need to visit your local Social Security Office, sorry folks, we're closed.  Need to speak with someone at the IRS, sorry folks, we're closed because most of our staff is at home.

Biden's mandate is an excellent start, now he needs to start making at least some of the thousands of Federal employees, who have been sitting at home for 18 months, get back to work and do their jobs.  Fully staffed offices.. of course not.  But, two employees working each day in a Social Security office, which before covid had 100 daily employees, just doesn't cut it.   Biden is incorrect in that most people want to work.  Most, if they can get paid to sit at home, will do so."
2021-07-30 13:30:30,"No more incentives.  Time for people in this country to start acting like a country and doing what’s good for the greater good. If you refuse to get vaccinated:
-are responsible for all your medical bills
-cannot attend concerts, sporting events, etc without proof of vaccination 
-employers must require vaccination 

Enough already. We would lose WWII with this sorry lot of Americans. We’re asking you to wear a mask and get a shot, not to storm Normandy."
2021-07-30 13:17:51,"Those who refuse to get the vaccine are contributing to what is ""the pandemic of the unvaccinated."" These selfish deniers care only about themselves and not about others or the social good. We have a long history of other vaccines, including many childhood vaccines, and still they deny science. They deny the reality of 612,098 deaths and many others suffering, often debilitating, side-effects.

For Biden to propose those refusing to get a coronavirus shot should expect inconveniences as long as they decline a vaccine is just the beginning ... expect more action against these  selfish deniers."
2021-07-30 13:22:57,"Sure, sure - lets give people a choice of a case of beer, a joint or $100 if that's what it takes. Yes, it's disappointing that that is what it takes, but we need to get shots in arms. It's too bad that most red states are anti-cannabis as well, but $100 would probably inspire them.

When I was a Corpsman in the Navy, the big, tough Marines would often faint when you stuck them with a needle. I imagine that many of the unvaccinated have this problem and doubt that any incentive would work for them. Still, they are relatively few in number and we could still reach herd immunity despite them."
2021-07-30 13:43:17,"Like other commenters who realized that they, too, could not convince someone to get vaccinated, I could not convince my brother who works as a CFO with a wife and five children, three of whom could get vaccinated. I kept hoping that the situation wouldn’t become so dire that one of their children caught Covid in order to convince them to get vaccinated. They live in one of the “hot states” and they read religious conspiracy literature that have them convinced they should be scared - this after my brother was raised as a military kid with a little yellow vaccine booklet that includes small pox and anthrax. 

But alas, it was the situation - the CEO’s brother caught Covid and is currently on oxygen - that led to all executives in the company being asked to get vaccinated. And so my brother has now received his first dose. I am thrilled, but I’m also aware of what it took. No reasonable conversation convinced him, no pleas from family, no literature to counter the arguments, nothing convinced him but his own livelihood and one person in authority. 

The effort to get more people vaccinated is probably going to be through these micro-community efforts going forward. President Biden taking the tough approach that you’ll get a swab in your nose - regularly - if you don’t get vaccinated is a terrific approach. Make it very uncomfortable for those who refuse, like my brother who was asked by his CEO. Go Joe."
2021-07-30 13:46:39,"“inconveniences”?

Really? Only inconveniences?

Unvaccinated people should be shunned and segregated from the rest of us that are vaccinated.

Why should our lives and freedoms continue to be disrupted by this lot? They have equal access to the life-saving vaccines. 

I don’t think that their rights trump (pun intended) my freedoms."
2021-07-30 13:14:29,One of life’s rules is “don’t reward bad behavior” - which giving the unvaxed $100 (or a chance at $1 million) to get a shot certainly qualifies. Better to get insurance companies to adjust their rates to reflect the added cost to insure the unvaccinated - much like with smokers or bad drivers.
2021-07-30 13:59:29,Many respondents have suggested that ignorance and selfishness are to blame for not getting vaccinated. I agree. Perhaps rather than an incentive there should be a disincentive: Void all health insurance coverage for non-vaxxers who seek coverage for getting the virus. That threat may cause some of the stubborn ones to do the right thing. Long shot. Worth a try?
2021-07-30 12:53:01,"I just hope that President Biden realizes that the two thirds of people in this country who are vaccinated and becoming furious with those who are not.  Pampering the unvaccinated with $100 payments is not going to play well with people who are vaccinated.  We have lost patience with the carrots.  We are going to start demanding the stick.  And there are plenty of sticks available to the federal government who, for example, has the power to make proof of vaccination a requirement for a PEL grant or to renew a passport or for a university to receive federal research grants, etc.  Those who are not getting vaccinated are imposing significant costs on the rest of society.  It is time for them to start paying too."
2021-07-30 13:08:03,"The wealth of information available about most of these vaccines begs the question about why the FDA is dragging its feet on authorizing these vaccines?

2021-07-30 13:37:07,This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated; it’s now a pandemic by the unvaccinated.  We all have to deal with the consequences of their failure to get vaccinated.
2021-07-30 13:38:07,"I understand the frustration that Biden is feeling. However, he stepped in it big time by the language which bordered on treats and challenges.

Governmental action isn't the solution. Make it a financial decision - allow medical insurance companies, including Medicare, to deny payment for Covid-19 treatment to anyone who isn't vaccinated without a valid medical reason for not getting vaccinated.

My guess is that the type and amount of medical care provided to Covid-19 patients could easily rack-up bills in the six to seven figure category when billed at full Charge-Master rates.

Grant public transportation providers the ability to deny access to all unvaccinated people.

One more step would be to allow people infected by the unvaccinated, with no medical reason for not being vaccinated, to be sued by people who, through contact tracing, can assert a link between the unvaccinated person and the subsequently vaccinated person.

Finally, allow companies to summarily dismiss any employee who refuses to get vaccinated without a valid medical reason for not getting vaccinated. No access to unemployment or other social assistance for those fired under this rule.

That makes the decision the choice of the individual. With that choice comes consequences. No, you don't ""Have To"" get vaccinated but if you don't there are consequences."
2021-07-30 13:39:28,"It is obscene to suggest financial rewards for people who have failed to get vaccinated. How about paying the rest of us who have been vaccinated ASAP, contending with poorly implemented scheduling systems, long waits in unfamiliar locations, and the general concern that everyone in the room was a carrier? And canceling all public benefits from those who refuse, as well as firing employees who refuse, public and private sector alike?Mandatory vaccination is long overdue. It  would get Covid ended ASAP."
2021-07-30 13:41:53,My wife and I still have the scars from our measles vaccines. We had to get those vaccines to start first grade. This was before vaccinations had somehow become political. I remember standing in line while the entire class got the shot. How things have changed.
2021-07-30 13:42:09,"Someone said, ""Everyone needs to mask up again."" Then why get the vaccine at all? (I'm already vaccinated, BTW.) People who refuse are criticized, belittled, and insulted. They're pressured everywhere to get the shot. One solution is giving it full FDA approval. Emergency only suggests not even the CDC trusts it. Mandating anything causes more resistance. Another problem is employers not paying PTO for flu like side effects after vaccination. I work in the healthcare field, and even our companies aren't paying for lost time from side effects. Losing money if they feel ill afterwards is a big disincentive to taking it. It's not as cut and dried as people think. We have to mask and patients have to mask, but if we're risking time off work without pay, many of us will refuse."
2021-07-30 13:46:06,"Parts of Macron's vaccination incentive are good. For example, a deadline for all in the health care and restaurant workers, after which their pay will be stopped.

2021-07-30 14:09:22,"More and more, Biden is becoming the Jimmy Carter of our times: He means well, but can't get stuff done.

Forget testing and pleading. Any worker, starting with federal employees, who refuses vaccination should be furloughed until they get the shot. What good does it do to test? By the time the positive result arrives, the damage has been done. He needs to go (reverse) Trump on this with strong action, not words. The military, also, needs to be vaccinated en masse, like I did way back in kindergarten (when Nixon was president) and a modicum of common sense prevailed: If you're not vaccinated against measles, polio, etc., you can't come to school.

There have been virtually no bad reactions to the COVID vaccine. We know the upside: Beyond public health, any nation that brings this under control will prosper. And our president lolly gags, wasting political capital on ridiculous assertions that a few changes in voting rules in a handful of states is the new Jim Crow while Typhoid Mary rages.

The virus doesn't wait for politicians. The longer this goes on, the worse it will get as variants spread. Jimmy Carter, inept and indecisive as he was, would do something. Biden is doing nothing that matters. He's a better president than Trump, which is a low bar, but not nearly as good as Carter, also a low bar.

I am hearing ad nauseam information about Covid and vaccination being repeated over and over. It is no longer news but it's broadcast as if it were news. Why not give, along with the vaccine, a short true or false test to find out what facts people know? Those facts have been hammered into people's heads day in and day out.

Instead of thinking of COVID-19 like the flu, we should think ""polio"" with life-long complications.  Many don't understand.  Sen. McConnell understands because he had polio as a child.

A vaccination is not a ""medical procedure,"" as Mr. Cosme erroneously calls it. When I went back to school years ago, I had to provide proof of inoculations before the start of class.  There was no student movement that resisted this requirement. But now we have an epidemic of mental illness that promotes and supports the continued spread of this virus. 

"". . .  many of whom have resisted taking a shot that is highly effective against a disease that has claimed the lives of more than 600,000 Americans."" Let that sink in.  These people are more averse to a vaccine than they are to a virus that has already killed so many.  

Where is Donald Trump, the man who instituted a new mode of thinking that says I can play doctor, scientist, and meteorologist with a Sharpie, and who continually underplayed the seriousness as the virus got a jump on us.  He has instituted ""I say it, therefore it's true"" as the new mode of thinking. While still plotting to maneuver himself into power, he fails to make the basic effort of promoting vaccines.

For starters, we need both Senator Mitch McConnel and President Biden to speak to the nation about the importance of vaccinations, not from the Oval Office, but from the Lincoln Memorial. This is the kind of immediate step and remedy, from the right place, that will go a long way."
2021-07-30 15:03:45,"I share the frustration of people who see the unvaccinated endangering all of us and wonder why they should be rewarded with $100 incentives for their selfishness and stupidity, but I can also see it from another angle:  I would not have accepted $100 three months ago (when I became eligible for the vaccine) to stay unvaccinated and at high risk of infection until now.  My prompt acceptance of a life-saving vaccine was its own reward.  Now we're down to the folks who failed to understand that basic risk calculation. I don't care what carrots or sticks are used as long as they take the shot before they culture more variants.  My resentment of their free money is not nearly as strong as my resentment of their refusal to get vaccinated."
2021-07-30 15:09:30,"I've been shocked they haven't required it in the military yet. I was in the military and was constantly getting vaccines for this and that - and I had no say in the matter.
The $100 incentives. NO. Reward people for bad behavior? forget that!!!"
2021-07-30 15:10:23,"The notion that requiring the military to be vaccinated is somehow un-American is absurd.  When enlisted in the Army many years ago, I was given so many vaccinations I felt like a pincushion and I heard no objections."
2021-07-30 15:17:42,"Everybody is blaming Trump, but the source of this problem is the neoliberalism/individualism that began in the 60s and hit full force in the Reagan/Thatcher era.

This is why giving polio vaccines was easy back in the day while half of society is refusing Covid vaccines today."

2021-07-30 16:27:55,"On the one hand, it seems wise to use any incentive that will work to get more people vaccinated. But on the other, is it fair to  those who got vaccinated early to pay only those who hesitated for whatever reason?  I suspect many will resent this approach."
2021-07-30 16:30:40,"Paying people to get vaccinated? That is obscene, especially given the fact that the majority of people around the world do not have access to Covid vaccines. It is like paying criminals not to commit crimes.

This pandemic has shown us that we are not one country but 51 states. Standing alone, each state will fail in dealing with this pandemic. It seems, it is the hall mark of this land of free that our fidelity is always only to oneself, never to the nation. It seems also, even when our lives depend on it, we cannot distinguish lies from facts, villains from heroes, and harm from benefits."
2021-07-30 16:22:22,"In a democracy the majority rules. Right now a stubborn minority is endangering everyone's health. We've been patient long enough. We should slowly ramp up the pressure, denying the unvaccinated the right to enter stores, restaurants etc, basically denying them the ""right"" to spread a deadly disease.

If that's insufficient and it turns out that the only way to get to herd immunity is forced injections then I say:

Grab 'em & jab 'em."

It's only that they care more about the 2022 election than the health of the American people. Democrats should use their reconciliation bill to make this happen, if Republicans stand in the way.

And now we are seeing rising cases of Covid infection in the vaccinated. The crime here is that the powers that be decided there would be no early treatment for the disease, only a controversial new technology called a vaccine.

Biden has the best chance of reaching the former working class that have been pushed out of jobs since 1980s.  But Republicans have to stop him succeeding.

2021-07-30 18:01:06,"Just a couple thoughts - 
Many comments describe those who are hesitant or decline to get this vaccination in villainous terms or as hopelessly ignorant, with a rather broad brush.  
I got vaccinated early on, being in the ""older"" age group that was among the first prioritized - this despite not being one of those who gets ""their annual flu shot"" - due to a combination of the potential lethality of this virus and some pro-active urging and arranging by my concerned son.
So just a couple of unrelated thoughts: 
1. Let's be fair - this vaccine is still very new, and was developed quite rapidly (at ""warp speed"") within the context of a highly polarized, inflammatory political period in our nation. As much as i disagree politically with one of the cohorts resisting the vaccine, i understand people's hesitancy to obtain it given it's newness. The part i don't get as regards this group of resisters is that it WAS initially developed during the reign of their leader who took credit for it as his accomplishment.  Go figure.
2. On the ""incentive"" piece - offering cash and commercial perks to get vaccinated is just CREEPY.  Upon reading about these ""incentives"" my gut reaction was revulsion, and with additional time, a longer range concern: will this become the new normal?  It's one thing to give a grade schooler a lollipop or sticker to distract from the hurt, and another to pay people to do what should be a considered decision based on sound evidence."
2021-07-30 18:37:27,"I fear the rules will make the preferred state to be ""I'm not telling"" so that the worst-behaved among us can continute to telework while those of us who take public service more seriously will be punished with meetings in unventilated places."
2021-07-30 15:07:07,"The economy is back to pre-pandemic levels, demand for workers is at an all time high and Covid relief checks have been spent.  Time to go back to work and start paying bills once again.  The last time I checked being a landlord wasn't a charitable occupation.  They gotta make a living too, right?"
2021-07-30 15:24:08,"Anyone with a heart would want to forestall an eviction.

Anyone with a head would know that property owners have the right to get paid for the housing they provide.

Anyone with both would know that our federal government couldn't possibly come up with a workable solution to this dilemma."
2021-07-30 15:25:03,"President Biden, you are wrong. You should not extend the eviction moratorium. Too many people depende on rent income. Congress did a one-size-fits-all bill the Trump signed into law. It was wrong then, it is wrong now, and it is wrong to prolong it.

There are way too many people that took the eviction moratorium and simply decided not to pay. Landlords have to maintain the property, pay the property taxes, heating, electricity and other bills that renters don’t care to pay and are living for free.

Renter protection laws and ordinances in San Francisco is one of many reasons rental and home prices in San Francisco is out of reach. Stop it now.

Eviction is critical to clean up bad renters. If government wants to help those in need because they lost their job, government should raise unemployment insurance and streamline the process so that it wouldn’t take months for those in need to get the money, but never put the onus on people that worked hard to purchase 2-3 homes so they can make a living off of renting their properties in their retirement."
2021-07-30 15:30:45,"There is a serious problem with the eviction moratoriums: the Constitution of the United States.  The Constitution explicitly forbids the government taking private property, which almost certainly includes rent payments landlords are owed,  without compensation.

The eviction moratoriums do not explicitly void rent that tenants owe; on paper the tenants still owe the rent.  But the simple reality is that without the threat of eviction, there are many tenants that will not pay the rent they owe, either because they cannot afford to, or, in many cases, they simply choose not to.

It is likely that if and when SCOTUS reviews long term eviction moratoriums, they will be found to be unconstitutional.  Congress is free to provide taxpayer funded government aid to support rent payments for victims of Covid, but they are not free to impose long term burdens on landlords. 

Landlords have their own bills to pay, and the bills come due whether or not tenants pay their rent. Many landlords are small property owners who rent out a few rooms; they are victims of the pandemic just like so many others, and their rights must be respected."
2021-07-30 15:29:21,"Weather you agree with the policy or not, you are taking money from one class, owners, and giving it to another, renters, without legislation or compensation. We have had plenty of time in the pandemic to correct both of these defects but have chosen not to."
2021-07-30 15:45:24,"As described in this article,  Congress has provided programs to help victims of the pandemic make rent payments. The problem is that at both the Federal and state levels, these programs are not being implemented by the government bureaucracies charged by law to do so. Many in the population are suffering as a result.

During the pandemic, many, perhaps most, government workers were allowed to work at home, and maybe given time off. This did not work well, and many bureaucracies fell behind, often well behind, in doing their jobs serving the public (which pays their salaries).

Many essential government functions are now delayed. It takes months to get passports; the IRS continues to send out automated letters, but doesn't answer the phone when taxpayers call in with questions; permits are taking seemingly forever; inspections are not being completed; countless essential government jobs are not being done.

One question that should be asked: given all this, why did the Democrats (with Republican support) declare Juneteenth a paid holiday this year?  Establishing a holiday, effective a year from now, would have been reasonable; the last thing we needed was to give government workers a paid holiday this year, when their work is so far behind.

Of necessity, we need to require government employees to return to their offices, to the extent safety considerations allow. This may mean mandatory vaccinations, and it may mean mandatory wearing of masks.  But the jobs must be done."
2021-07-30 15:46:38,"The problem lies with the states implementing the funds to renters and landlords.  Most states have barely issued any funds, even though they have been in possession of the money for months.  They were given an additional 30 days to get the job done, which they failed at.

How much more time will it take the states to do their job?  I seriously doubt extending another 30 days will make a difference.  It's time to stop prolonging the inevitable.

Those who have applied for rent assistance can still stay in their homes, while awaiting a determination if they qualify.  Those who did not apply will be evicted.  It's time for us to move forward as a society and to allow our housing economy to right it's self."
2021-07-30 16:30:08,"The issue is not just about renters. I own a small rental and my tenants have not paid any rent for six month, and yet they cannot be evicted, and they know it. If the federal government wants to force landlords to let these people stay, rather than rely on the renters to apply for rental assistance, why not allow the landlords who can demonstrate that their tenants are delinquent on rent apply for the rental recovery directly."
2021-07-30 16:53:55,"The issue with the program to pay back rent is that it requires landlords to not evict the tenant for another year. There's certainly a portion of the tenants who have abused the policy as they weren't paying rent while still working or collecting more in unemployment than they received from their jobs. Many of the abusers are simultaneously and maliciously damaging the property and locking out the landlord. No landlord is going to accept funds that will require them to keep the abusive tenants in-place and on their property for another year.

I've been following these stories in the Times and read many of the comments as I've been dealing with a nightmare tenant situation (although not for non-payment, but the moratorium has not helped matters in my situation). I've read many comments from landlords dealing with unscrupulous tenants. However, I've yet to read a comment from a landlord who hasn't receive rent, but it's because the tenant is a single parent who could not work because of childcare issues due to the pandemic but the tenant is continuing to take good care of the property and helping with odd jobs where they can. That's the type of tenant that should benefit. I'm starting to think that situation is rare since that type of tenant would have moved in with family, realizing they could never pay the back rent."
2021-07-30 17:55:29,"It can, in normal times, in San Francisco, take two years to evict someone for failure to pay rent. During that time they can ruin the unit, bring in roommates who can then have to be evicted separately, and they can harass owners and other tenants. Because, you know, property is theft.
I haven't rented anything out for more than a decade. I once had  middle class dreams of using a few homes as rental units to fund my retirement. It has worked out. I sold the houses I bought very early in life when I worked as a union-member grocery clerk (a big shout out to Retail Clerks Local 648). Many grocery clerks did that. It was the late 1960s and early 1970's and you could actually buy 3 or 4 rental homes and they added to income significantly. 

Sometime in the 1990s it started to change. Even tenants with good histories became...different. They knew it cost a lot to evict them, especially when in SF there are tenant law service groups that defend anyone. By 2000 I was afraid to rent to anyone and by 2007 all the properties were sold except the one where my mom lived.

It makes no sense for a middle class person to try and be a small landlord. When there was a strike in the 70s, I told a family  on strike to just skip their rent. The husband found a job mid-strike and actually came to me saying he could pay again. I cannot imagine that happening today,"
2021-07-30 17:28:08,"Who is going to pay my property taxes, water / sewer / trash bill - utilities? and mortgage?
And on top- food for my family?

And the wort is; I do see that my tenants have taken vacations, bought new TVS and openly refuses to pay rent - rest alone, keep the property clean."
2021-07-30 17:50:38,"In the meantime, property owners go bankrupt because the banks aren't forgiving mortgage payments, insurance companies aren't forgiving the property insurance, and the IRS is giving free passes only to the billionaires with enough money to shoot themselves into space for the thrill, and pay ZERO $ in taxes in their worst years.

Anyone who's read any of my comments knows I'm a Democrat, but any relief money for rents needs to go to the owners of the properties, not the tenants. 

This is going to be a disaster."
2021-07-30 18:23:30,"And extending the moratorium another month will accomplish exactly what?  Kicking the can down the road so this messed-up government program can somehow get sorted out in a month?   Won’t happen!  The moratorium was a bad (and an unconstitutional taking of property from landlords) from the outset, and it’s a bad idea now.  How will the tenants pay the back rent?  Answer:  They won’t.  People who could have paid the rent simply didn’t, and probably don’t have the funds now to repay the landlords.  Result:  Evictions, increased homelessness, landlords suffering further financial loss while evictions wend their way through the courts for what may be years, and a hugely distorted rental and housing market."
2021-07-30 15:23:57,"Too big to fail? Has the government through a program of forbearance simply created a ticking time bomb like the have with student loans? Allowing the amounts owed to balloon to the point where only the taxpayer can solve the problem.

A stupid program that should have never been started in the first place, should have never been extended and is now going to cost billions to solve and still not prevent people from being evicted."
2021-07-27 22:42:47,"My wife and I were both fully vaccinated in late March. She has RA and is immune-suppressed due to her treatment. I'll be 65 in October. We're in a state that has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. I stopped wearing a mask about 6 weeks ago when I went to the supermarket, CVS, or the library. It was a bit disconcerting at first, but felt ""norma"" after a week or so.

But I went back to the mask today when going to the same places mentioned above. I also noticed more customers and employees wearing masks as compared to just this past weekend. We also turned down a wedding invitation for late August after careful consideration. We would have no way of knowing who was/wasn't vaccinated and didn't want to risk it. 

It's horrible that we're in this position, a supposed ""advanced"" nation with the virtual miracle of being able to vaccinate every adult. Yet ignorance, stupidity and blatant lying has overcome countless millions."
2021-07-27 22:38:42,"From the article:

""...C.D.C. officials also recommended universal masking for teachers, staff, students and visitors in schools, regardless of vaccination status and community transmission of the virus. With additional precautions, schools nonetheless should return to in-person learning in the fall, according to agency officials.""

Unless.

'Good facts' make 'good ethics'; and 'good ethics' make 'good decisions'.

But 'good facts' without 'good ethics' do not, repeat do not necessarily engender 'good decisions'.

There will be situations where facts plus ethics suggest--perhaps even mandate--a return to virtual education. 

Unthinkable? Start thinking about it--and preparing to do it right.

As the Director said--""Children aren't supposed to die"".

Unthinkable?"
2021-07-27 22:32:03,Vaccinations should be required for all employees and in all schools. The unvaccinated can stay home until they come to their senses.

2021-07-27 22:43:07,"I object to the phrasing of the first line of this article. The CDC isn't ""revising a decision made just two months ago."" That makes it sound like they are waffling or changing their minds. Rather, they are continuing to be responsive to the changing conditions of the global pandemic and the impact of new variants. That's what we want the CDC to do. 

Were Americans to get the vaccine, as the CDC and others have recommended and advocated, the CDC guidance might not have to change. But since almost half of the country has not gotten the vaccine, the CDC will have to continue to adjust its guidance as pandemic conditions demand."

2021-07-27 22:49:56,"I'm so incredibly sick of this country treating anti-vaxers with kid gloves. That's exactly what this advice comes off as. Those who followed directions, stayed inside for lockdowns, masked up, got vaccinated now have to once again protect those among us who don't care about others at all.

The vaccine hesitant have had a chance with the carrot, now bring out the stick. Let health insurers charge higher premiums to those who are unvaccinated. We already do it for tobacco users because of their higher health costs. Once costs go up watch employers start mandating vaccination."
2021-07-27 22:48:46,"This is absolutely the wrong policy: 
- It does nothing to incentivize those who are unvaccinated but persuadable. ""Get the shot......and your life won't change at all""
- It undermines confidence in the vaccines themselves - ""if they work, who do I still need a mask?""; 
- It makes vaccinated people resent those who won't take the vaccine even more, like we needed more division.
- It further erodes public trust in the CDC, if that's possible at this point; 
- It confirms the suspicion many unvaccinated have that ""restrictions will never end, no matter what we do""; 
- It puts the burden of protecting the unvaccinated not on *them*, but on those of us who did everything right and got the shot the second it was available. 
- It makes us all feel like we're going backwards in the pandemic response, undermining Biden's entire message that we're coming out of this much better than other nations. In a recent survey, the level of optimism about the country's direction is down 20 points since May. This is not helping."
2021-07-27 22:47:09,"This is a good step (coming too late), but it seems like it could be confusing for many (adding yet another layer of bungled public health communication re the CDC and masks). Whose responsibility will it be to check the color coded risk chart each week (the county, the city, the rural village administrators, the state, the individual business, the individual person)? I too wish they had just said masks for all for indoor public spaces for now and will re-access at said regular intervals depending on dynamics of virus. Also, would be helpful if they could reiterate specifics on what constitutes a proper mask for the general public : a piece of loose cloth does not equal an n 95 or good KN95."
2021-07-27 22:53:37,"I have grown very weary of people complaining that the CDC supposedly doesn't know when it's doing and doesn't know what the right answer is, so why bother to follow any of its directions and wear a mask at all? No one outside of the science field seems to realize that we are processing information much more quickly than we would have in the past, both for understanding what the virus is doing, developing the vaccines, and how to react to the variants. This is actually science at its best, not its worst. And even though it's frustrating to change behaviors, we're responding to facts and data, not guessing.￼"
2021-07-27 22:58:22,"It’s incredibly frustrating that those of us who have been cautious and responsible this past 1.5 years are still at the mercy of those who refuse to vaccinate. I see first hand family members in another country desperately trying to get the vaccine - unable to travel and get a visa, or spending outrageous amounts of money to fly to an adjacent country and quarantine for a period of time, etc. It is tremendously difficult in many countries and it’s heartbreaking and infuriating that so many here have the privilege and would rather pedal inane conspiracy theories than do their part."
2021-07-27 23:19:33,The CDC should never had reversed the mask mandate 2 months ago...it made things quite a bit difficult for many business.   Folks will like about being vaccinated and not wear a mask just like the folks who refused to wear masks at the beginning of it all.
2021-07-27 23:15:58,"Bar a few counties in November last, the situation would've been flipped. The Trump White House would have hailed ""Operation Warp Speed"" a miracle, and those not now taking the vaccine would be lining up to take ""Trump's jab"" in reverent awe at the maestro's deliverance. I suspect that what is going on goes like this. For the past 30-40 years the professional classes have cared little for working and rural America, even as their living standards stagnate or even decline. We see what some call an epidemic of ""deaths of despair."" So the sentiment seems to be not unlike climate change; ""we've been burning for 40 years, you've been making fun of us incessantly as we do so while lapping up the lifestyle, and now, guess what? We're gonna burn together."" Solidarity and empathy cuts both ways, I'm afraid."

So what was the point of getting an experimental vaccine?

If you fear Covid, wear two. Or better, stay home.

But it’s your choice, and your choices don’t impinge on me

Sadly I don’t live in a free state where freely taken choices are respected"
2021-07-27 23:09:39,"It's good to see the CDC back to urging masks even for the vaccinated given recent events, and the sheer ferocity of the delta variant. Still a lot of us wish they'd stop referring to COVID-19 breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated people as ""rare""--it's clear by now that they're not, and we can still catch and spread COVID, even severe cases, making mask-wearing and PPE all the more important. To pick two recent examples, most victims in a July COVID outbreak at a Las Vegas hospital and in Provincetown MA were fully vaccinated, many wound up in the hospital, on ventilators or died. The CDC should also reverse its dangerously short-sighted decision to stop tracking non-hospitalized breakthrough cases (which also raises questions about the ""rare"" claim)--we urgently need this data, and even so called ""mild"" COVID cases, often a misnomer, can get the dreaded long COVID syndrome.

Closer to home, all of us now in my family and my laboratory are fully vaccinated, but just in the past month more than a half-dozen have gotten COVID with one hospitalized. Clearly the vaccines are very helpful in preventing severe cases, but delta clearly poses a bigger threat of this even in vaccinated individuals, plus the question about waning levels of immunity 5 or 6 months out. The data from Britain and Israel are already showing this, and now ex. New Jersey, S. Carolina and here in Oregon more of the deadly COVID cases are in fully vaccinated. Essential workers esp. need more and better PPE."

I had hoped some normalcy would have returned by now, but I was wrong.  What bothers me the most is hearing how those who are unvaccinated, gets this delta variant, are hospitalized and as they are dying, begging to be given the vaccine.  I simply just don’t understand the reasoning behind all of this."

2021-07-27 23:26:10,"Let me first say that I am firmly in favor of the vaccines, and drove 120 miles roundtrip to get a vaccine the first day I was eligible. And I observe the rules requiring masks, including the one just reinstated in my home county yesterday. 

At the same time, I think it important that we look at the scientific evidence clearly and without regard to politics. When we do, we can see that the vaccines have been oversold. They do help prevent Covid-19, and particularly hospitalization and death. But they are not the silver bullet the evidence seemed just a month or two ago to show they were. 

The evidence from Israel is most stark, and the UK shows the trends more than is yet evident in the United States. But all the talk about delta variants and mask mandates cannot mask one increasingly clear fact: the vaccines will hasten the end of the epidemic, but they will not bring it to an end. 

It's sad to say it. But whether we mask or not, or get vaccines or not, whether we lock down or not, the virus still seems to have the strength for at least one more surge. Let's get ready to ride through it."

Though we do practically no tracing in this country, anecdotally it sounds like some infections are being carried and transmitted by traveling people.  SO, in addition to masks, I would require proof of full vaccination from all people who want to fly. I also wouldn't object to requiring rapid COVID testing at the airport, even if it was done only on random flights without advance notice. The testing could be paid for through a temporary surcharge on all airline tickets. In addition to helping stop spread of virus, I would hope these actions would help us get a better idea of scope of infections, especially breakthrough infections."
2021-07-27 23:30:35,"I follow the news in the US, France, Germany, Austria … It's the same everywhere: you can take the mask off and a few weeks later you should put the mask back on. I can live with the mask, but what's going to be next? Curfews? Lockdown? Travel restrictions? I was hoping they would get lifted, but I feel I can forget about that. And why? Because so many people still aren't vaccinated although vaccines are available. In all these countries people debate wether it would be ok to restrict what unvaccinated people can do. Wouldn't it be unfair? Seriously? Could we please stop worrying about how these people who jeopardize our future feel!"
2021-07-27 23:28:14,"I visited China 6 times after the SARS Coronavirus 1 in 2003-2004 hit China and I saw masks been worn by most local Chinese people and temperature was checked at all entry points by road and by air. There is a good reason why China was better prepared than any other country in the world when the SARS-CoV-2 escaped from Wuhan into the rest of the world. Lockdowns in China were brief but very strict. One other thing I observed in China was wearing of PROPER MASKS PROPERLY. As a self appointed polite unarmed unpaid mask police during the first COVID wave in USA, I observed many maskless people and those with masks were not serious. Masks dropped below the nostrils leaving nostrils wide open. If wearing masks is not taken seriously  by either vaccinated US residents or by those who have not received vaccines especially children below age 12, it will have very little impact of stopping the spread of the delta variant. 

As I said earlier and I repeat. Vaccines alone cannot stop exposure to droplets or aerosols carrying COVID but together they can protect a vaccinated person wearing a mask by blocking exposure and eliciting a protective immune response if COVID crosses the barriers. Better safe than sorry. My father repeatedly said Prevention is a better than cure. He survived 5 respiratory pandemics during his life well lived, past a century. He never skipped a vaccine and always complied with hygienic practices.

I survived  travel to a COVID epicenter and returned COVID-free."
2021-07-27 23:25:30,Here we go again. The CDC continues with the fear and paranoia on mask wearing. This constant shifting of on again off again. Keeps the public fearful and paranoid. They have divided the country over those vaccinated and those not. We live in a country founded on freedoms and liberties. A country forged in the blood of those who fought and died to protect those freedoms. Don't tread on me. Live free or die. Words that made America land of the free and home of the brave. Fear is control. Control is power. If you're distracted by those around you. You can't see the actions of those above you.

The rest of my family are less vulnerable. ""War-weary"" is an inane adjective to put on the from page of your paper."
2021-07-27 23:27:57,"I am vaccinated and healthy and I am NOT putting that thing back on my face to protect people too dumb to protect themselves.  

Vaccine Passports and Mandates.  

We won’t get out of this by punishing the responsible people.  

The only reason these fools remain unvaccinated is because we keep trying to reason with people who refuse to see reason. 

Stay home and order your groceries on Amazon if you won’t vaccinate.  

The rest of us don’t want you out here in public."
2021-07-27 23:11:19,"NYT, how come your author buried at the bottom of the article the fact that those who are vaccinated generally are asymptomatic and, if symptoms are seen, DO NOT get seriously ill from breakthrough infections?

“Some of the infected people had symptoms, but the vast majority were not seriously ill, suggesting that immunity produced by the vaccines quickly curbs the virus.”

After spending a year and a half sacrificing, social distancing, masking, etc I’m not putting a mask back on to protect those (the vast majority of the unvaccinated) who are unwilling to protect themselves. A complete no go from this New Yorker and many others in my social set, regardless of the CDC guidance du jour."

2021-07-28 00:03:31,"More important than the renewal of mask mandates, the US should be instituting the most basic of mean of stopping a virus from spreading - quarantine. 

Through out history the use of quarantines has always been elemental to disease control. In our enlightened age we scoff at quarantine as being medieval. It’s not. 

We need to close down all international flights and other ingress into the country. Further, we need to severely restrict internal movement within the US, especially from out of highly infected areas. 

Quarantine restrictions on movement would be the best way to contain the delta virus from further spreading. It’s long overdue."
2021-07-27 23:45:09,"Frustrating to say the least when the supplies of the vaccine in the US have exceeded demand for over 3 months now while we revisit a third wave of infections. To think that if all of the available doses had been administered to date we would be speaking of the pandemic in the past tense. 

Absolutely mind boggling."
2021-07-27 23:43:12,"I think that we can conclude that the CDC has not been purely ""guided by science"" and the sudden May relaxation of mask guidance (when the Delta and other varients were evident in other countries) was infuenced by messaging the benefits of vaccines.   Many public health experts were in fact saying that May CDC declarations about masks were premature at the time.  Given the CDC's early 2020 statements that masks weren't neccessary and reluctance to recognize that aerosols suspended in the air transmit the corovavirus until this Spring, this shouldn't be surprising."
2021-07-28 00:04:55,"The arguments, if you want to call them that, that I hear from anti-vaccine people amount to little more than “you’re not the boss of me“. People should be required to show proof of vaccination before entering businesses, Although I can already imagine the outcry."
2021-07-27 23:43:28,"Biden's Administration has done so much better than the prior Administration.  But I was bewildered by the updated guidance a few weeks ago that lifted masking recommendation on the ""honor system"".  If they haven't realized by now that honor is simply absent in anti-vax/anti-mask people, then I'm not sure they've learned the lessons of last year.

Or, and this might also be worth asking, are there any Trump appointees leftover in that agency that are fumbling this on purpose?

Regardless, we all have unlearned lessons from last year.  The biggest missed lesson is that if we can see a little trouble with this virus, it's already miles ahead of us.  Let's try all following masking guidelines, and continuing to do so until this virus is truly crushed around the world."

2021-07-27 23:56:01,"Again, the CDC and Rachel Walensky are 5 steps behind the virus. The Delta variant entered the US in March, so of course, in May, they relaxed mask guidelines. Now, after the delta variant has taken over and is spreading exponentially, after many hollow reassurances that we didn't need masks, only now are we are getting told to wear masks again. Thanks for the tip, Captain Obvious."

2021-07-27 23:55:20,"Here is some info on masks that can really protect the wearer.

All advanced counties produce an anti-viral masks (which are also called respirators), designed to protect health care workers in Covid ICUs.   

The N95, made in the US, are the only mask approved by the FDA.  The downside is the higher cost and discomfort.  Many people find them hard to breathe through.
T
wo other widely available masks are the KN95 and KF94.
The KN95 is made in China.  Until 7/1/2021 the FDA authorized some KN95s for use in health care settings in the USA, because of the shortage of N95.  This mask is less thick than the N95 and much easier to breathe through.  They are also a fraction of the cost.
The KF94 is made in South Korea and tested by their government.  It shares the advantages of the Chinese mask: easier to breathe through and less expensive.

I want to stress that all three masks have been battled-tested in Covid-care settings.  All three masks are sturdy and reusable in the light virus context of the supermarket.  If you regard your office as a heavy virus context, you can disinfect by placing the mask in a sealed paper bag for three days and then discarding after five uses.

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.
I think, therefore I mask."

The truth is that we are humans, and are not omniscient. In my opinion, the CDC, most of the medical profession, and our researchers have done great work trying to protect us (heck, even Operation Warp Speed if only Fox andTrump hadn't sabotaged the rollout) .  All the stats looked really good in the U.S. in late May....but not now.  I'm in LA which-like many cities- is experiencing rapid infection growth.

2021-07-28 00:24:04,"The situation in the southeast is terrifying. I just learned today that my mother urgently needs surgery, which has been scheduled for Friday morning at a major medical center. Although she can have the surgery, there are no beds available for post-op patients because of Covid. In normal times, she would be admitted for two days of post-op care and observation. Instead, she is being sent home as soon as she's out of recovery, and my siblings and I are scrambling to find her in-home nursing care until we can make arrangements to be there. We're all vaccinated, but it's still nerve-wracking. Three weeks ago, DeSantis was reassuring everyone that Florida hospitals were not overwhelmed and could accommodate community needs. Clearly, things have changed! Please, folks, mask up and take care of yourselves.  And, for goodness sake, if you haven't yet been vaccinated, get it done as soon as possible."
2021-07-28 00:12:24,"I have this recurring thought: We’re going to end up with a vaccine-resistant variant. This thought plays in my head like a disaster film, and I feel more afraid now, after being vaccinated for almost 3 months, than I did when we had no vaccine. People will complain about the continuance of mask wearing, but I am not going to be in close distance to anyone without an N95 mask on. A new variant always seems to emerge when community spread is rampant."
2021-07-28 00:28:54,"Unless they are N-95 masks, they aren’t going to do much. If there are gaps between the face and the mask, the virus can get transmitted to both vaccinated individuals (through breakthrough infections) and unvaccinated individuals. 

So wear a mask but have no illusions about the level of protection. We use only N-95 masks because one person in our family is immune compromised and more vulnerable. Our social life consists of doctors’ visits and outdoor cookouts and parties where all are vaccinated.

We have much to learn about the Delta virus. Are breakthrough infections truly rare? If so, how come I know of 2 case? Both were mild but that included 8 -10 days of misery, fevers and loss of taste and smell. Plus pure exhaustion,where even getting out of bed and walking across the room was a major feat.

Better than hospitalization and potential death? Of course. But still no walk in the park."
2021-07-28 00:20:13,"Why are unvaccinated athletes representing the U.S.A. in the Olympics? (Just because the IOC says they can?) How can we root for Olympians with unknown vaccination status?

2021-07-28 00:22:09,"This change makes no sense.   If you are vaccinated you can get and spread the Delta variant.  Understood.  But you are very unlikely to get seriously ill from it.  And any of the others who you may infect are also very unlikely to get seriously I'll provided they are vaccinated.
So again, it all comes down to who is vaccinated and who is not and for many of us the unvaccinated are on their own.  They are making a choice and they should accept the consequences.
If the CDC wanted to do something useful it could push for more vaccine mandates by governments and private employers, increased use of vaccine passports (I have my Excelsior Pass but have never been asked to show it) and require proof of vaccine to go on airplanes or enter the country.   But they don't...
This seems irrational, poorly communicated and virtually certain to end badly."
2021-07-28 00:29:49,"I just learned that France banned homemade masks in January for use in public, saying that the disposable surgical masks offer better protection and safety. Not a single word in the last 6 months about this in any US media. Yet most people out in public in the US are wearing homemade masks that are likely reused and filthy. I wonder how the CDC thinks their mask recommendations are helping to keep people safe and healthy?"
2021-07-28 00:14:05,"We are at a point where this virus will be with us forever.  Our focus should be on the benefits of vaccination, not penalties for those who already stepped up for a vaccine.

This attitude of us vs them, let the unvaccinated suffer their consequences, is callous, particularly when we all pulled together to protect the elderly who were dying a year ago.

The more people infected, the more opportunity for variation SARS-CoV2 will have. Delta illustrates that unchecked infections permit emergence of strains with immune escape potential and possibly more virulence. What if it evolves to infect children better, to kill children? Are we still going to say we are done with masks and lockdowns?

The CDC’s major mistake was ever saying we could take the masks off without hard evidence that the vaccinated couldn’t get infected or transmit. They should be making a posteriori decisions. Instead, they made an a priori assumption and now have to back track because of “new” evidence that many of us suspected all along based on common sense."

Stop calling them that because it makes them sound like  total aberrances. This leads to the grave misunderstanding that something unforeseen has taken place and likely reinforces the no-vaccination stance."
2021-07-28 01:48:01,"this is a terrible decision, which makes it sound like the vaccines don’t work. they offer extraordinary protection. i’ll mask in a place that requires it, or if asked, but it isnt my problem if some anti-vaxxers get sick - we need to move on. no more restrictions. 
i want to see vaccine mandates for all teachers, all students, all healthcare workers and all cops- no exceptions.
now these fools have more ammunition- “look, the CDC said vaccines don’t work and so vaccinated people have to mask anyway”"
2021-07-28 01:40:41,So….vaccinated people should wear a mask to protect people who won’t get vaccinated (and likely not wear a mask?). Nope.
2021-07-28 02:41:59,"And to think that some health workers are not vaccinated either. What kind of training do these people have? Make it mandatory for health workers (and other workers) to be vaccinated in hospitals and nursing homes. if they do not want to, they should search for a job in another sector. Protection by vaccination in the health sector is primordial."
2021-07-28 02:25:34,"What I am ""tired and frustrated"" about is CDC's tepid and zigzagging guidances. First they released a complex flowchart for who should wear masks and in what circumstances. Then they abruptly and prematurely did away with the mask requirement, for vaccinated people, even through there is no way to know whether the customer that just walked in is really vaccinated or not. And now they have a formula for deciding who should wear masks.

All along, the guidance should have been very simple: Wear masks indoors. Wear masks outdoors if there are others within 6 feet. Simple."
2021-07-28 02:05:48,"I’m not sure you understand the difference between public health measures and something that is nobody’s business but your own.  And also note that NO ONE is going to force you to get an immunization. It’s your choice not to be vaccinated, but there are consequences to that choice."
2021-07-28 02:01:11,"Time again to reinforce what this country has forgotten to do: Take personal responsibility.

Once again, what did people do before, both those who can be vaccinated and those who can't because they're immunocompromised, with other contagious and serious past and concurrent diseases in our society (including the perennial flu)? They took personal responsibility and got their vaccines for them, or took appropriate actions to try to avoid situations where they may most likely encounter others spreading the virus. (Another example: the noroviruses around us each season.) 

Masks are ""supposed"" to be to protect others from ourselves. If we've been vaccinated, just like with all other diseases' vaccines, the shots just mean they can help us to not get the disease or not get it severely. But there's no promises with Covid or other illnesses' vaccines ever that they completely rule out us contracting them at all. What did we do during previous years' other illness outbreaks before we knew of Covid? Did we wear masks uniformly as a society in the same way then? We didn't, no. It's also common sense: Covid or not, don't go outside and lick the ground, or touch a flat surface and then stick your finger in your eye or your nose, etc. When did Americans lose common sense?

Sadly, some folks with underlying other diseases or demographics can still be vaxxed, get Covid, and be compromised to become very ill--as with other illness/vaccine scenarios. Please vax or/and use common sense!"
2021-07-28 02:33:14,"Right now Florida ia about as bad as it gets in the USA. The news is out there for all to see and it's clear that regardless of vaccination status we should all mask up and those who are not fully vaccinated should probably stay at home. Today at the local grocers I was the only one wearing a mask and that includes the store staff, The store management will likely change nothing until they hear from our governor. If you can find someone to wager with you I suggest you could pretty safely bet on another Florida surge in about 3 weeks."
2021-07-28 02:02:43,"When I was five, we all had to be vaccinated for small pox before entering kindergarten. We all were. No one, that I ever heard of,  suffered worse than a temporary scab on our arms. None of us got small pox. There were no protest groups. Life was so much simpler."
2021-07-28 01:38:45,"No problem.. I never stopped using it even after being fully vaccinated.  However, this whiplash decision is causing a credibility issue with the CDC although I do understand the reasons why it was done at the time.  When they made the announcement of not requiring masks, I thought the decision was too soon at that time and now that it is back ""ON"", I fear the public will be even more hesitant to comply."
2021-07-28 02:03:24,"Forcing public schools, as in Texas, to ignore CDC guidelines is a cynical attempt to destroy public education. Parents cannot trust that the schools will keep their children safe because of these policies,thus undermining public education. Tyranny must  to destroy public education to succeed."
2021-07-28 02:59:46,You can actually choose what vaccines you want. It’s still a free country. I turned down a Shingles shot a few weeks ago because I had already two shots of the Pfizer. I’m irritated about people who won’t get the vaccine but totally understand.
2021-07-28 02:55:59,"I do not understand a political point. Why is it that people make the vaccination mandate an individual liberty issue and not, say, wearing a set belt. Seat belts are mandatory--does this mandate violate American citizens' liberty? (and wearing them or not does not affect other people, just increases the risk for the person who refuses to wear it-- or wants to be ""free"" from being ordered to wear it. Refusing to vaccinate impacts other people. Why the panic to get vaccinated if we get all kinds of vaccines as infants and throughout life? Incomprehensible to me from various angles."
2021-07-28 03:14:52,"June was hopeful.  I hadn’t seen a Covid infection I. The ER in week.  Then a couple weeks ago, a few hear and there.  Now it’s roaring back and yes most people are not Vax’s, seeing more and sicker Vax’s patients.  I was feeling so hopeful in June.  We all needed a mental pandemic break.  

Here we are again.  Cases rising.  Being mad for whiplash advice from the cdc is like being mad at the weather man because it’s raining.  If we could just come together as a country.  We could make this right for the world."
2021-07-28 03:27:40,The solution to getting anti-vaxxers (many of which are Trump supporters) to take the vaccine seems pretty simple to me: Biden and the CDC should be urging them NOT to get it.
2021-07-28 02:18:34,"Vaccination while good it’s not perfect. You can get sick and you can make someone else sick. The only sure fire way to end this pandemic is for everyone to stay away from each other for long enough for this disease to die from lack of having a host.￼

2021-07-28 02:07:00,Thankfully most sane people in the Bay Area never stopped wearing a mask.  I now wear my N-95 or an N-99 mask into crowded stores.
2021-07-28 03:27:23,"This is beyond deplorable.

The Iowa governor is suggesting immigrants are partially to blame for rising COVID-19 cases.

You can't have it both ways.  Iowa depends on hundreds of immigrants, many illegal, to work in meat processing, and Big Ag jobs across the state.  Everything would come to a halt without them since no one wants this hard work.

She has sent Iowa State Patrol officers to the Texas border.  I don't know what they can do since I assume they have no jurisdiction in Texas to enforce any laws."
2021-07-28 03:07:36,"If it weren’t for those who can’t get vaccinated, I’d happily tell those who won’t get vaccinated what they can do with themselves."
2021-07-28 02:29:53,"The Biden Administration shouldn’t fumble on the use of face masks.   If, in the thick of summer, when the Covid virus is supposed to remain dormant, keeps spreading, what are the Fall and winter going to be like?   Even for the fully vaccinated?    All government employees -no exceptions- must be required to be vaccinated; Otherwise, imagine sending your child to a school where the staff are at risk.  Because the Education Department hasn’t developed an online curriculum, online schooling this past year was a disaster.  Already, there’re “studies” showing how far behind all public school kids are     It borders on madness and criminality to discover that only about 50% of healthcare employees are  vaccinated.   Isn’t this plain crazy?

Everyone wants to return to a normal life, but the new normal requires face mask wearing.   The Biden Administration should be  developing more effective and more comfortable face masks.   If the Mars Rover can pick up and analyze Martian soil material, we can have better face masks.  At the current rate, vaccine boosters look inevitable."
2021-07-28 01:56:43,"Perhaps the government should incentivize vaccination by paying everyone who gets vaccinated $1,400."
2021-07-28 02:37:58,"I'm wondering why the NY Times said ""some"" - if you look at the CDC map showing the areas in the U.S. that are ""substantial or high risk"" it is most of the country, and it includes ALL NYC counties. Wondering when they will state that strongly, because New Yorkers really need to hear it."
2021-07-28 03:01:41,"I totally agree with Dr. Ali Mokdad of U. of Washington - the CDC should simply say everyone in the US should wear a mask indoors. 

I'm here at Mayo Clinic with a double procedure scheduled for Thursday.  I am fully vaccinated as of February, but I am required to have a Covid test tomorrow (I agree with that).  If I picked up the virus on my 1,000-mile drive, I will be denied my necessary health care.  

The hypocrisy, ignorance and cruelty of those who refuse vaccination is beyond the pale."
2021-07-28 01:59:16,"Genuine question - re: the unvaccinated, we (me included) easily point to the southerners, the red states, the Trump supporters, those who don’t believe in science, etc. But on any given evening you can walk by playgrounds in progressive, left-leaning Brooklyn and see playgrounds packed with unmasked kids. We all know that kids get infected, get sick and are vectors vis-a-vis COVID. Should we point fingers and be angry at these parents and caregivers too - as we are with the Trumpers?"
2021-07-28 03:27:48,"These new recommendations won’t change my behavior; I never stopped wearing my mask, largely because of the conservative, skeptical, dismissive environment in this state. I knew this was just a matter of time, so why should I be caught unawares? 

This evening, we listened to Dr. Fauci on the PBS Newshour. He sounded tired, dispirited, frustrated that the efforts of so many who have worked to crush the virus have been impeded by the resistance of millions operating under mis- and disinformation. So many intelligent and diligent public health professionals, unable to resolve the most powerful force holding us back: ignorant and belligerent Americans."
2021-07-28 06:23:42,"Twists and turns are okay, we all need to adjust to a changing situation and the more flexible and adaptable we are, the more likely we are going to win. Wearing masks out of doors when there's either nobody around or with a good flow of air that disperses aerosoles doesn't appeal to me though. I'm in talks with friends who are suspicious of what they call ""untested"" vaccines. We've managed to remain on friendly terms. Common sense and sympathy for other views might help during the application of the rules. Difficult balance to strike, I know."
2021-07-28 04:00:04,"I don’t get it. If you’re vaccinated you have a close to zero chance of getting seriously ill from covid. This is even more true if you are not part of an at-risk group, but is even true to an extent for ‘higher-risk’ groups. At most you may come down with something resembling a flu, but even that is incredibly rare and occurs in only a very, very small fraction of vaccinated individuals. A little more common with Delta, but still highly uncommon. So why make vaccinated people wear masks?  Constant, long-term masking is uncomfortable and, yes, also emotionally unhealthy. It’s one thing when we’re doing it to avoid a high and immediate risk of very serious illness and death, it’s another to force entire populations do it long term just to avoid a minute number of cases in high-risk individuals. Looking at the science and the hard numbers, at actual studies showing efficacy rates and hospitalizations and deaths, it just doesn’t make sense anymore. Have we gotten so accustomed to the psychic comfort of masks that we can’t let go? What am I missing??"
2021-07-28 05:43:58,"Any idea why it's taking the FDA so long on the approval of Moderna for 12-17 age group? Modernal filed for approval for this age group in early June. Some kids in this age group are waiting for Moderna and with school about to start, there can only be gains if Moderna is approved sooner than later. Europe already approved. Why is it taking the FDA so long?"
2021-07-28 03:32:41,"It does not matter what any doctor or respected medical organization tell people. We will continue to have a large segment of the population refusing vaccines and masks. The unvaccinated are also the more likely to resist wearing a mask.  It is completely hopeless at this point. We will never be rid of this virus without a tough stance on vaccination. Every business, school, church, hospital, airline, etc. must require proof of vaccination and enforce mask mandates. Otherwise this will never end. It is unfortunate Americans must be forced to vaccinate and mask up."
2021-07-28 05:03:36,"It used to be Americans could articulate why they were against something, even if their opinions were sometimes reprehensible. Now I read or watch these people who are against taking the vaccine, and they can't put a sentence together to make an argument. How do these people even pour milk into their breakfast cereal bowl? It is truly frightening."

2021-07-28 03:42:00,"Japanese American internment during WWII was justified because 'you just couldn't be sure of the loyalty of those of Japanese decent.'

I'm asking myself if the 'loyalty, patriotism and moral compass' of those who refuse vaccination, and the danger they pose,  isn't far worse than any possible enemy sympathizer or terrorist among us.

The US military and civilian death toll from WWII was slightly less than 420,00 over the course of nearly 4-years.  The cause - defeating fascism and militarism.

The US civilian death toll from Covid is approximately  610,000 (nearly 50% greater) in about 1.5 years.  The cause - community spread - over 200,000 deaths after the vaccines were widely available.  In the last 6-months, that translates primarily to those not wearing masks and/or refusing vaccination.

So, are those refusing vaccination patriots, or terrorists willfully spreading infection and death among their fellow Americans?"
2021-07-28 07:25:30,"All the comments are about how weak and confusing the CDC is. None of the policy, intelligence, or messaging strength in the world is strong enough to push back against the rot of Facebook. Facebook is why we’re reading these headlines still. 

Facebook’s recklessness with human life and our mental/societal well-being is the pandemic."
2021-07-28 03:31:30,Impose a 25% income tax on the unvaccinated over and above what they are already paying. That should get their attention.
2021-07-28 04:47:19,"The unvaccinated will eventually get COVID and in time we’ll reach herd immunity. At this point, isn’t it better for them to get sick as soon as possible to get this pandemic over with?  Why prolong things by masking up and protecting people who refuse to help themselves?"
2021-07-28 04:30:12,If masks prevent infection that vaccines don't - why do we need vaccines?
2021-07-28 05:36:26,"It was a ridiculous move, absolutely not based on science, to tell the fully vaccinated they didn't need to wear masks at all any more.  And now the CDC is expressing surprise that the fully vaccinated can carry very high viral loads and spread the disease to others.  But all they had to do was to look months ago at what was happening in England with the Delta variant - a country with a much higher vaccination rate than America.  I am absolutely not an anti-vaxxer or anti-science.  Now the science says that fully vaccinated individuals, who can be infected and completely asymptomatic or very mildly ill, can spread the Delta variant of the disease to others.  That, frankly, is scarier than an unvaccinated person who gets sick, gets a test and then isolates or goes to the hospital with the coronavirus.  Fully vaccinated individuals can spread the disease without knowing they have it or thinking they might have a mild cold.  The CDC never should have changed the mask rules and they should have investigated first what was happening in England with the rampant spread of the Delta variant there despite a much higher vaccination rate than America.  Everyone should go back to wearing masks all of the time.  This new guidance from the CDC for the fully vaccinated is ridiculous and requires people daily to check the infection rate where they live or where they will be traveling to that day.  Just mask up everyone."
2021-07-28 05:10:41,The fault lies squarely with Dr. Walensky of the CDC.  Masks should have been mandated until 70% of the country was inoculated.  The Director of the CDC made a political decision not a medical decision when she prematurely announced that vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks.  Fellow scientists are being kind when they say there was not enough information about the Delta variant.  This entire pandemic is constantly in a state of flux.  That is the nature of viral pandemics.  Walensky should be fired.
2021-07-28 08:32:17,"The CDC, like everybody else, has had to adjust to an ever-changing landscape of virus mutations, and to the stubborn refusal of the unvaccinated. 

CDC messaging has been far from perfect, but its errors pale in comparison to the decision making of those who won't risk the shot.

If you want to point fingers at the ""wildly incompetent,"" point to the army of unvaccinated folks; they are America's petri dish, and eventually we'll all be ingesting whatever the unprotected concoct.

I don't hate them any more than I hate humans for causing and furthering climate change, but I am saddened and angry at such irresponsible behavior that places all of us at far greater risk."
2021-07-28 06:29:44,"What do anti mask people, insurrectionists, those state legislators who are making voting more difficult, and Trump supporters, what do all these groups have in common? 

They are all republicans. 

Democrats are fighting to expand ACA, republicans have litigated to shut it down. Democrats are advocating FOR the Equal Rights Amendment, republicans oppose it. Democrats are trying to mitigate Climate Change thru infrastructure bills, republicans oppose Biden's advocacy.

Until recently, humans typically worked in their own self interest but since 2016 and the rise of Trump, one third of the country has succumbed to relentless lies and propaganda. 

Wearing masks makes sense, just like wearing seat belts in cars, and remaining seated during airplane takeoffs. The cure is simple and that is to prosecute Trump for the myriad of instances of obstruction Mueller reported, Ukraine blackmail, lining his pockets, and tax crimes. The sooner he is exposed and in jail the sooner the madness will end."
2021-07-28 04:13:02,"It’s time for the tyranny of the minority to end, whether it’s the minority composed of Trump/ MAGA voters, vaccine deniers, mask-resisters or other frankly misguided or malevolent actors. Enough. The majority of people in this country are tired of being abused by these fanatics. Adopt common sense public health measures to beat the pandemic, defend democracy, and end the Electoral College and voter suppression."
2021-07-28 04:56:16,Maybe we should wear three masks. To be extra safe.
2021-07-28 10:22:31,Insurance companies should not approve payment for hospitalization costs for Covid patients unless patients have been vaccinated or medically exempted from taking the vaccine.
2021-07-28 08:54:08,"I'm vaccinated. I have yet to stop masking indoors in public. I work retail in a tourist town. I'm the only worker still masking. Many of our customers come from places with low vaccine rates and surging cases. I assume any adult wearing a mask is vaccinated because the rate of mask wearing is down to about 2 percent of our customers when it should clearly be at least 50 percent if unvaccinated people are complying with their duty to mask. I assume the kids wearing masks are loved and cared for and are being taught responsibility, compassion and common sense whether they are vaccinated or not (presumably not due to age). About a quarter of unmasked customers make it clear to me that they view my mask wearing negatively and not because they believe I am unvaccinated and a risk. Conservative anti-science, anti-truth, anti-rational thought have permeated our society and is causing death. Conservative lies matter."
2021-07-28 10:40:15,"I think most commenters are missing something important; if the vaccinated can transmit the virus, they can transmit mutations. 

This is the reason for the new mask guidelines. It's not about preventing mild illness, it's about preventing the virus escaping our defenses.

On a personal note, I'm going into an office tower with a few thousand others in a few minutes. No one will be wearing a mask."
2021-07-28 09:37:33,"Yes, they could have advised the whole country to do masks, but I think we’re not there yet. That may be the next step coming down the road as this gets worse. They do have that option but probably feel they need to wait a bit more. It also helps to take it step by step, I think it becomes more acceptable, than to simply throw in people at the deep end. I think it’s better to start by making these recommendations for more at risk areas, take time to study the evidence as it emerges, and if the picture continues to really get worse, recommend it for all. But it becomes less politically palatable when you just turn it all on! Let’s take our time as we progressively get back to masking and the problem becomes more clear, especially since many people are vaccinated. If you simply push everybody who’s vaccinated, then those vaxers will also say “you see, it doesn’t matter what you do!” And of course the vaxers will say anything that suits them, so they can’t be a yardstick! But I think the cdc is doing it well here. Let’s start slowly and progress. Already more people are starting to mask up again even in areas without the higher infections the cdc refers to."
2021-07-28 09:58:40,For sure the virus is outsmarting the vaccination efforts to contain it.The vaccine was only given emergency use approval which was not enough to advertise the vaccines and to mandate them as safe and effective.The FDA has to rethink its protocol during this pandemic so the vaccines get greater acceptance.Until the FDA gives full approval for the current vaccines the naysayers will make the point that vaccines are not fully approved.People are sick and schools and businesses are on shaky terrain until a safe vaccine is mandated.The FDA needs to engage in emergency sessions to revise their vaccine approval.
2021-07-28 10:01:30,"A few weeks ago when everyone should've seen another surge coming, the CDC was saying ""masks not needed if vaccinated"".

Is it really asking too much for government agencies to be fully competent?"
2021-07-28 10:03:39,"The U.S. averages the following:

1300 deaths per day due to tobacco use.
820 deaths per day due to obesity.
260 deaths per day due to alcohol abuse.

I'm vaccinated.  Wore a mask when it was recommended by the CDC.  Will wear a mask if the county in which I live and work if the thresholds established by the CDC are exceeded.

BUT, at some point this has to end.  This spring I read several articles where viral disease experts concluded we would never reach herd immunity through vaccination and that this virus would  spread through communities and as it did would lose its potency.  People would develop increased immunity over time, rendering the virus's effect to that of the common cold.  At the beginning of the pandemic, masks and shutdowns were to slow the spread so as not to overwhelm public health systems.  Now it seems the goal is to eradicate the virus; which was deemed an impossibility before.

Since this now seems to be our goal, when will tobacco, big macs, and alcohol be illegal?  I'm tired of living a healthy lifestyle and paying exorbitant health insurance costs because others can't control their vices."
2021-07-28 10:21:12,Break through infections of the vaccinated are illustration one that we as a people are not going to be able to vaccinate our selves out of the pandemic caused by a  virus that can replicate itself as fast as a corona virus.  Vaccines are counter intuitive and provide a mindset that viruses can be stopped dead in their tracks like what was done with polio.  The major difference is corona viruses infect not  only people but the animals we eat.  Their natural evolutionary quest will be to evolve and  mutate to avoid any medicines that will stop their spread and evolution. Vaccines for corona viruses have not been successful in our animal herds as variants continually arise and humans are beginning to find out that the same will hold true for them. An alternative solution maybe to get people healthier as those with underlying conditions are much more susceptible to being adversely affected by the disease.  In fact some scientists feel viruses will  become more virulent as they evolve to allude the vaccine efficacy. Don't blame the unvaccinated  for not stopping natural evolutionary forces.
2021-07-28 09:34:30,Thank You C.D.C. for following the Science. As the FACTS change guidance should change. The pertinent FACTS are that the Delta Variant is spreading primarily due to the unvaccinated so masking is needed to protect everyone.
2021-07-28 11:13:13,"Would someone please explain to me why I should wear a mask if my vaccine is 95% to 98% effective?

If I'm safe from infection who am I protecting?

If anyone around me is not vaccinated shouldn't they be the ones to wear a mask and continue social distancing?"
2021-07-28 11:18:27,"I dutifully wore my mask from the beginning and very gratefully obtained my vaccine as soon as I could get it.  The change in CDC guidelines coincided almost exactly with my second dose. I gladly ditched the mask, except when spending time around children who through no fault of their own are unable to be vaccinated at this time. Now I'm being told to mask up again. The reasons given are a bit vague, but it's clear that the chief reason is to protect people who have chosen not to get the jab. I'm not willing to do that."
2021-07-28 11:26:25,"Restating the essence of the article: it is unclear whether vaccinated people transmit the virus, meaning that there is no solid evidence that they do; even if they do, breakthrough infections are still ""rare""; nonetheless, masks are advised for vaccinated people because ""the big concern is that the next variant that might emerge ... could evade our vaccines."" In other words, our lives are being restricted not because of what is happening, but what might happen. Add to these facts that in India, where Delta emerged, cases shot up to 400K/day, then within four weeks plummeted to 40k/day of their own; and in the UK shot up to 50k/day, and within one week have fallen in half, while lifting restrictions fully -- both suggesting that whatever surge is taking place in whichever areas of the US will end soon, even if we continue to live our lives."
2021-07-28 09:44:02,"So you reduce your likelihood of ending up in the hospital or dying, and because it helps to protect others, especially those unable to get vaccinated…read the full article, including this bit at the end: “So far vaccinated people account for just 3 percent of hospitalizations, officials have found.”"
2021-07-28 10:52:09,"The CDC and WH are failing at communications about covid. There also appears to not be a plan. What is high level of infection? What is medium? What is a clear recommended roadmap for beating covid? 

Why ban travelers from Europe where they have now a higher vaccination rate than thé US? What is the logic behind the WH position, especially with close allies and where families are being separated without any logical reason?

President Biden - get your team together to get a plan, coordinate your communications and ensure there is fact and science based support. Then let governors and businesses execute the strategy locally. Please."
2021-07-28 11:12:33,"Asking vaccinated people to wear masks is going to be a big problem. I've been vaccinated since March and I do not want to go back to wearing masks just because unvaccinated people refuse the vaccine. I'm tired of the Trump followers and enablers getting their way and endangering the lives and welfare of citizens that are trying to do the right thing and move this country out of the pandemic. Mandate the vaccine and call out all the phony anti-vacer politicians and media talking heads that have taken the vaccine, but pretend not to have."
2021-07-28 10:23:49,"Anyone living with an unvaccinated relative, including a child,  should be both vaccinated and wearing a mask when at home.  That being impossible,  as a result, the rudderless CDC is  still pretending that this gaping opening is not a threat to the entire population outside that home.  

This is the vector of continuing evolution of new variants that will eventually make the current vaccines useless.  

None of these people should ever appear in public indoor places, without 100% masking, even if they are vaccinated."
2021-07-28 10:49:30,I’m fully vaccinated and I’m just wondering why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine (first two approved for emergency use) are not “fully approved” by the FDA. Does anyone know what the reasoning and status of this delay is? Maybe this full FDA approval would help the optics of those not vaccinated yet?
2021-07-28 11:21:19,"CDC is squeezed between its political leadership model, they have more limited science than we might have imagined and suffer from a failure of imagination in failing to prepare to for a well-warned pandemic. Glaringly, a lack of tracking/tracing has caused them to track only hospitalized breakthrough infections. That leaves a huge knowledge gap. 
As a politically correct entity, they don’t want any recriminations against them for “bad” things, thus asking you to mask is their safe recommendation. 
As to the science, they track only hospitalized breakthrough infections, and coupled with the US’s insufficient genomic tracking, says we don’t really know how often vaccinated people get the bug, whether they can be carriers/shed virus if asymptomatic and thus whether vaccinated people convert to infectious at some (unknown) rate. Not knowing is crippling. 
We have information that breakthrough infections are indeed rare, with the State of Virginia and CDC releasing data that shows incredibly low breakthrough illness (Virginia only) and almost nil breakthrough deaths (both). VA state had 18 deaths/1,157 illnesses. Projected onto the US population that would translate to 85,000 total US cases and fewer than 1,500 US deaths versus millions of cases and 628,000 deaths. CDC: breakthrough info n/a; deaths 1,141 deaths among 161 million vaxxed, equating to a national death toll of less than 2.500. 
The logic for vaxxed masking isn’t there."
2021-07-28 10:42:03,"They have officially lost it. What science is this based on, since the decision to unmask was based on no scientific evidence?"
2021-07-28 11:18:11,"The moral basis for masking is non-existent.  At this point the only people who aren’t vaccinated are children and people who choose not to get the vaccine.  Children are at very low risk and adults who choose not to get the vaccine have made their own choice and should live with it rather than expecting everyone else to change their behavior to inoculate them from having to get vaccinated.  

More importantly, the fact that the CDC is telling us what we should do is quite insane and shows how lazy and cowardly our politicians are.   Politicians are shirking their basic obligations to make political decisions.  Science can only help advise us as to a risk of a given course of action.  Whether the risk is worth taking is not a scientific question; it’s a personal or political one.

Risk tolerances run the gamut across society.  Some people hear about risk and will immediately do anything, no matter the cost, to avoid the risk.  Others throw their hands up and bare the risk as a necessary evil of living a life that will eventually come to an end in spite of best efforts.  Still others seek the risk out as an end in its own right (e.g., people who do extreme sports or swim in the open ocean with sharks).  

Question: What does science say about the appropriate amount of risk tolerance?  Answer: absolutely nothing."
2021-07-28 11:35:21,"For many of us this changes nothing: we live with unvaccinated kids, and/or in a community with a low vaccination rate, and we never took off our masks indoors and never started “going back to normal.” 

But even if you did in unmask and “reopen” we have to accept that the pandemic is not linear, new information becomes available constantly, and good science reacts and responds to updated data. 

It isn’t a flaw of the science that masks are being recommended again, it is a virtue of the science to be able to identify these changes and make appropriate recommendations."
2021-07-28 08:48:17,"Trump and then Covid have exposed the truth about America. A country in decline, perhaps perpetually as Xi Jinping says.

Anthony Fauci is trying to cover for the premature declaration of mission accomplished for the vaccinated to no longer wear masks nor social distancing.  COVID-19 is still mutating while only 48% of Americans are fully vaccinated.

2021-07-28 10:14:24,"We talk about terrorism. Clearly, it’s people here who’re killing people here the most. We’ve learned in the last four years and from this pandemic that the biggest threat to the country is, in fact, some of the people here themselves, and we’re seeing more of it now and are likely to see even more of it. “Terrorism” is mere politics. When you look at it factually, the greatest danger is mostly from people here themselves. They kill more people through the many mass shootings, the gun crime, and now this entirely optional pandemic by refusing vaccination. 600,000 plus lives aren’t enough. They want to take more with them!"
2021-07-28 11:46:48,"Despite all the incessant media coverage of this virus, the statistical reality is that, for vaccinated individuals, the pandemic is over.  The risk is low.  It is not zero.   Proof:

The number of breakthrough deaths and hospitalizations for vaccinated people in the U.S. is lower than the top 50 leading causes of death in this country.  Vaccinated people face a greater risk of dying from the flu, from car accidents, from a stroke, from cancer, from drownings, from homicide, etc., etc.  

The reality is that for most vaccinated people who do get Covid, the illness -- if there are symptoms -- is highly unlikely to be anything worse than the flu.  

This has not sunk in.  Many don't want to hear it.  People are scared and angry.  But in this highly emotional state -- and the media has not helped with this -- what gets completely lost is a sense of perspective, statistical reality, and an accurate perception of risk.  

In my opinion, Covid no longer merits constant, 24/7, day-to-day news coverage.  For vaccinated people, it is no longer a newsworthy medical concern.  The people for whom it is a realistic concern (the unvaccinated), have made their decision.  

If, despite the statistical reality, vaccinated people remain scared (because they don't ""know"" whether other maskless people around them are vaccinated), they are free to wear as many masks as they feel necessary to protect themselves.  End of story."
2021-07-28 11:49:07,"We toss around the term gaslighting kind of lightly these days. But, man, am I feeling it right now. I have two kids under age 12 who are set to return to in-person school in nine days. Our local school district has issued ""guidelines"" like ""if you prefer to wear a mask...you should wear a mask."" We are in a CDC-designated red/high transmission zone. (We have 106 cases/100,000.) And the CDC guidance seems unequivocal to me: everyone should mask up indoors; especially in schools. 

However, our school leaders assure me that ""our"" local health experts say we don't need to mask. These ""experts"" remain unidentified, yet I'm supposed to trust them with my children's health?! No way. My kids will wear their masks until they can be vaccinated."
2021-07-28 11:50:07,"Just insert the word science into anything and aim to convert the nonsensical into the sensible. The time to tell people to wear masks was in March 2020. But oops, they couldn't figure out that wearing them could reduce the transmission of a respiratory disease. The vaccinated are at almost no risk. So the guidance should be: be prepared to get Covid if you're not vaccinated. No one is going back to masks."
2021-07-28 11:57:44,Oh for goodness sake.  It's a mask.  Put it on for the hour that you're in the store and remove it when you leave.  Why is this such a hardship?
2021-07-28 12:01:04,"There seems to be a widespread lack of comprehension in these comments that fully-vaxxed people are indeed at real risk of becoming breakthrough cases. While I know the official numbers are currently low, they do not reflect what I am seeing and hearing in the day-to-day, which is WAY more breakthrough cases than seem to be reported or registered. Just because a breakthrough case doesn't result in hospitalization and/or death doesn't mean it may not come with potentially troubling health repercussions down the line. Never forget that this virus is new, devious, and in no way fully understood, and it won't be for some time. I had both my shots (Pfizer) back in March, and I am returning to masking in any indoor space now, it's far too risky to do otherwise. Of course, yes, the vaccine refusers have created a fertile breeding ground for variants, and will only continue to do so. Soon we may have a strain that gets around all vaccines. But nothing and no one is going to change those unvaxxed hearts and minds, that much is clear. Better safe than sorry."
2021-07-28 12:01:24,I am still trying to figure out what to do with this new mask guidance.  If the CDC is concerned that vaccinated people (like me) can still get seriously ill from COVID then I'll put a mask on again.  On the other hand if the only reason the CDC is saying that all people need to wear masks is so that some people can have the luxury of not getting vaccinated then I'm sorry but I don't have that kind of generosity.
2021-07-28 13:13:40,"I never stopped wearing my mask in public.  I understand the CDC and the FDA are driven by politics and funding. I follow local case count and vaccination rates as well as testing rates for my state.  I live in Vermont, the number one in vaccines and among the lowest in deaths.  I have switched to an N95 mask.
Why?  Because I'm 80 with risk factors and I don't want to spend my life battling long covid or worse.  People need to protect themselves from all viruses and flu especially as their immune systems age and are not as strong.  Eat well, exercise and protect yourself from viruses. I imagine in the future they will discover that many diseases start from having a viral infection.  Even bacterial infections that require antibiotics can cause chronic illness.  Antibiotics wipe out your microbiome, producing imbalances that may be responsible for anything from C-Diff to depression and IBS."
2021-07-28 13:30:24,Another blunder for the CDC & Dr. Walensky. Their indecisiveness on masking guideline makes them look incompetent. Do we agree in this?

I am 75 and was vaccinated in February. Just because there 
are out there some folks who say ""you can't tell me what to do"". They wear seatbelts now they can't smoke in certain areas, because if not for themselves but for others safety. 
Yea, you are now putting  my health at risk. How can anyone be so thoroughly self centered and  egotistic. I just don't understand it. 

Pandemics have been around centuries. And we, with modern medicine, have the ability to stop this out of control silent killer that mutates and becomes ever more dangerous. I am scared. Back to wearing masks and maybe even a booster. I am angry at those who are too selfish to see the danger to themselves and others."

2021-07-28 13:14:21,"The insurance industry was built on the idea of shared risk spreading.  Insurance companies can refuse to insure if the risk is unreasonable or heightened by evidence of direct reckless human activity or, in the case of climate change,  consequences of planet-warming that will flood coastal areas filled with hotels and homes where no one person is to blame rather than the entire population on the planet.  

We have a way to prevent severe Covid illness.  It's the vaccine.  The science is clear about its efficacy in preventing costly hospital stays and death.  Why should my healthcare premiums be used to pay for the hospital stays of others when they could have avoided the cost by getting a vaccine?   We talk about how costly health insurance is.  Part of the cost is that those who could have avoided huge hospital and doctor bills do little to improve their health.  Riding a motorcycle without a helmet, eating nothing but. junk food, no exercise, and yes, not getting the Covid vaccine and winding up in a hospital for 4 weeks in the ICU.

The anti-vaccinators want their freedom?  I also want freedom from their stupidity and unnecessary expense.  They should pay for their avoidable hospital stay.  Coddling ignorance and stupidity will get us nowhere with our rate of vaccination to achieve herd immmunity."
2021-07-28 13:58:29,"We always seem to be trying to appease the science deniers, so nuance recommendations and complicate explanations so to not offend the easily offended right.

It seems obvious that we urgently need to get full authorization for this vaccine, yet still not shortcut the process. I think both Pfizer and Moderna have submitted full paperwork for this. It needs to be treated as a four alarm fire to get full approval NOW. 

Once that’s done, no reason to not get severe with vaccine deniers. You refuse to get vaccinated, the insurance company won’t pay for covid related expenses. You need a vaccine certificate to get on a plane, pass customs, work. 
Let’s be clear, this is worse than COVID-19. This is Covid 2021 and we don’t want to meet covid2022. And children can’t yet be vaccinated, and there are many with immune issues. 
Stop coddling the ignorant and selfish. 
Oh and private industry will work for the gun problem as well. Insure it or lose it."

Masks are needed in places like public transportation or theatres, where people spend a lot of time in close quarters, but in supermarkets?

We know that vaccination, not masks, is the answer, so why have the vaccinated assume responsibility for the lives of those who are too ignorant or hard headed to take the vaccine? Will that not only postpone herd immunity and increase the chance that another, more serious variation take hold? The easy, immediate answer seems to be wearing a mask, but how does that get us to the end of this nightmare?"

I know more than a few people that are not going to get it for whatever reason - none of them medical or religious, or any other legitimate objection.  Until they are mandated to get vaccinated, I am not going to follow a mandate to wear a mask because of them. If you are not vaccinated please do so and wear a mask to protect yourself.

2021-07-28 12:32:58,"I strongly disagree with those who refuse to wear masks and refuse to vaccinate. But those 2 behaviors should not be equated.

I understand and appreciate concern for the long term safety of the vaccines. And, since younger people rarely suffer severely or die from this virus, hesitancy by people under 30 is more reasonable than by those over 30. Nevertheless, I disagree with their choice and I think they are foolish to refrain from vaccination.

No one should be forced to vaccinate. However, everyone else has a right to be protected from those who refuse vaccination. For example, I think employers should protect their employees and the public they encounter by discharging employees who refuse vaccination.

Mask-wearing is an entirely different matter. A mask is essentially an article of clothing. Anti-maskers make no protest whatsoever to the laws which require everyone to wear clothes covering certain parts of their body when in public. Indeed, I suspect the vast majority of them would strongly object if people were allowed to run around naked in public.

I think everyone, both vaccinated and non-vaccinated, should be required to wear masks when indoors in public. I do resent non-vaccinated people who won't wear masks in public (or intentionally wear them below the nose)."
2021-07-28 12:04:45,"We need to stop the hand wringing and carefully nuanced milquetoast statements and take bold action. Does the CDC really think that anyone is going to modify their behavior based on regional level statistics of vaccination ratios? We need bold leadership from government and companies that mandate vaccines to participate in society or it's going to be lights out for the economy. 

The anti-vax contingent is nihilistic enough to desire an implosion of the economy and relishes any federal mandate as it would play nicely into their world view of freedoms being taken away and proving Trump was right. They have little to lose. Politicians in the Neo-Confederacy and Fox News continue their disinformation campaigns for long term political gain at the expense of everyone else. Facebook continues to support the dissemination of misinformation. Planes continue to fly jam packed with the non-vaccinated. Companies executives continue to put their heads in the sand and force everyone back to the office. 

None of this ends well unless we really get serious and stop thinking there is no limits to personal freedoms when living as part of a 21st century society."

2021-07-28 13:19:39,"My trust in the CDC in the last year and a half has eroded to a point where I am skeptical of anything they announce. Their knees buckled right out of the chute in this Pandemic when, to appease Trump, they waffled on the effectiveness of masks. I was astonished. Our family was wearing masks regularly almost a month before the CDC came out recommending to do so. It’s simple common sense. If masks weren’t effective to stop the spread of germs, why are they routinely worn by doctors and by cancer patients in public places.
That said, it is stunning how no one seems to be able to think for themselves and the level of selfishness that has been demonstrated over the last year and a half. 
I truly believe that each one of us is on our own to navigate whatever disaster befalls us whether that is a Pandemic or a natural disaster such as a tornado or a flood. Any help that comes is either misguided or too little, too late."
2021-07-28 13:01:31,"The CDC has failed us so badly.  Waiting for a rise to occur and be recorded and only then advising masks is after the fact.  Have people not learned that prevention is better than trying to catch up later?  Everyone should be masking now, not after the surge has been underway, and continue masking until there is a sustained period of low infection.

And people with their nose sticking out are not wearing masks.

And periodic testing is not a substitute for masking."

2021-07-28 13:44:43,"In the fight for the hearts and souls of the people, mixed messages from CDC, now on masking, and previously on ""herd immunity"", have not helped.  Instead of trying to interpret local Covid 19 data and suggesting actions, as they are now, CDC should specify the metrics that will trigger the necessary corrective actions and leave it to other local organizations to inform and advise the public.  

When humidity is low, and there are high winds, and the rainfall has been minimal - weather experts tell us that the risk of fire is high. Where I live, the Rio Grande conservancy and the Forest service issue a ""high risk"" warning. There are many more examples - of flash floods, unhealthy smog levels and so on - where communities follow the science, when rules ""fixed"" and are easy to interpret.

CDC must step up and list the metrics for Covid 19, and suggest corrective measures when those values exceed normal ranges.  For example, the number of new infections per 100,000 could be one metric.  A local community could then enforce the corrective measures that suit them.  This also holds the public accountable:  if they help keep infections down, then the restrictions would also ease. 

In short, we need metrics, range of acceptable values and rules based decisions.  In reality, that may be happening now.  If so, publish the metrics and rules - let us scrutinize them!"

Seriously, these are the people largely responsible for throwing us back into the soup. Why give them a chance to spread their mental viruses?

It’s not like this is tricky. A new strain appeared, pretty much as predicted; it’s spreading rapidly, very much as predicted. Therefore CDC revised its guidelines, and asked people to a) get vaccinated right away, and b) wear a good mask if they’re in a risky area and indoors.

These people can be identified with spike protein antibody testing. Pfizer's data shows immunity in some patients fading quickly in  just 6mos. Are the breakthrough infections from the non-responders and the vaccinated who lost immunity quickly? We don't know yet.  Eventually, possibly soon, there will be a variant that specifically targets young children-- who are not eligible for vaccines. The unvaccinated and people like Carlson, the other Fox News pundits and DeSantis of Florida  will be responsible for the deaths of these vulnerable children and should be held accountable for their disinformation campaigns."
2021-07-28 14:56:18,"""emergency approval"" is a strawman. 

As soon as the vaccines receive full approval they will move on to the next expedient excuse. 

Even when they are laid up sick and close to death recent interviews show they will still make up excuses for not taking the vaccine.

All while those who have come to the realization too late, beg for the vaccine after it is too late, and hope theirs will be the cautionary tale that others will finally hear will be ignored like all the ones that came before. Discounted and just more evidence for the deniers of whatever they want to believe."
2021-07-28 18:04:58,"It's time to stop this virus, and no amount of ""urging"" will do it. Many others have commented that vaccine refusers and mask refusers should either be denied medical insurance or at least have their premiums go up very substantially. My first instinct is to deny them actual treatment when they show up in the ER or ICU, but I understand that's untenable in a practical sense (however justified). These people are bringing us all down, and it cannot be condoned or enabled."

Similarly the FDA final approval of the most effective vaccines ever launched will continue to be caught in process while millions more die.  Too many will refuse to require or take vaccines until the FDA finally approves them.  

We humans are unequipped to protect ourselves as a species and I believe it is clear how we end.  We earn our demise as climate change may full well demonstrate."

2021-07-28 15:51:33,"The fact of the matter is that we'll likely have surges and new variants for a long time until most Americans both get vaccinated and wear masks.   Unclear or nuanced guidance, or relying on individual assessments of risk or ""honor systems"", simply doesn't work with many Americans, and will allow continued spread and mutation of variants.   But the CDC, elected officials, and many business owners (like the store owners here in New York that have made masks optional) seem to think that bright line guidance or mandates as to vaccines and masks either can't be enforced or aren't worth the short-term costs.   Aside from this (and the fact that things change), we also don't have the infrastructure or capacity to collect data for more precise or tailored rules."
2021-07-28 17:54:17,"Is there new evidence showing that non-N95 masks are protective for the wearer? Because my understanding has always been that masks function best at a group or population level by reducing transmission FROM those with a high viral load-- vaccinated or not. This article, CDC statements, NPR, other news sources, etc. seem to be consistently conflating reasons for mask wearing and using language that suggests wearing a mask is highly protective for the wearer. I understand the public health/ PR reasons for muddying the waters here, but it sure makes it hard to take other statements at face value."

2021-07-28 22:22:07,"The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India, displacing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and other pre-existing lineages. Mathematical modelling indicates that the growth advantage is most likely explained by a combination of increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Indeed in vitro, the delta variant is less sensitive to neutralising antibodies in sera from recovered individuals, with higher replication efficiency as compared to the Alpha variant. In an analysis of vaccine breakthrough in over 100 healthcare workers across three centres in India, the Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generates greater transmission between HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (p=0.02).

I was OVERJOYED to be fully vaccinated.  Because I had followed the rules for a year, when the vaccine allowed me to re-enter the world, I saw it through beautiful new lenses.  I got on an airplane with awe and excitement.  I attended a community theater performance with a smile on my face.  I dined INSIDE a restaurant laughing with [vaccinated] friends.  I celebrated the very chance to exist on this planet.  I planned lists of adventures.

But then May and June 2021 were over.

Now the people who won’t get vaccinated are stealing this sense of joy and freedom.  They are too selfish to do the right thing and are RUINING the chance for this country to put the pandemic behind us.  Sometimes I think I just HATE them.  Isn’t that terrible?"

2021-07-27 10:25:37,I'm not the least bit surprised about this. People should get vaccinated for the greater good so as to slow down or stop the pandemic. The vaccinated should be allowed to do things the unvaccinated can't. That will bring most of the unvaccinated to their senses. There are some hard core people who will never get vaccinated. I know a few of them. How long do these people want the pandemic to go on? It's proven the vaccines work.

These people need to stop thinking only about themselves and start thinking about others in their community.  I am vaccinated and still wear a mask - that way I know I am doing what I can not to spread this disease further in my community as a potential carrier without symptoms.

2021-07-27 10:29:50,"I wish that the CDC and public health officials would deliver clearer messaging that vaccinating adults protects kids, and it is adults’ responsibility to this for them.

Some countries, like the UK, are not even offering the vaccine to children, except those who are high-risk. They are pursuing a strategy of adult vaccination instead because kids are at extremely low risk from COVID and vaccinating adults, who are the main drivers of spread, drives down transmission for everyone. 

We asked so much of kids, keeping them home from school and friends for a year, in the name protecting adults. Now’s it’s time for adults to step up and get vaccinated to protect them."

Okay, I'm kidding, but some form of shaming is appropriate. And I'm with Joseph who commented on ""urging"" hesitant relatives (or friends) to get the vaccine. I'd tell my hesitant pals to ""Get shot or get out."" In fact, I've done it. Then again, I am a mean girl. RealityChex.com"

People still buy and drink water from plastic bottles, they eat meat, they consume, consume, consume. Even if some people behave properly, or at least try to, there are more than enough people who do not to insure the extinction of our species from the planet. Perhaps this has always been an inevitability, but we are hurtling toward the precipice and many people are firmly pushing down on the accelerator.

2021-07-27 10:36:58,"While some insist we show sympathy for those not choosing to vaccinate themselves (or their children), there is reason to think this view is backwards. Perhaps the sympathy should be flowing the other way--from those who refuse vaccination (other than for substantive medical reasons) to those they endanger (including their children).

It is not difficult to understand why health care settings are demanding vaccinations for their workers. If some families are split by those decisions, so be it. At least they will be alive to argue and possibly forgive in the future. And others around those receiving the vaccines will be safer.

It is also not difficult to understand why vaccinations would be required of others in close contact with large swaths of the public or their fellow workers. Even if the vast majority of breakthrough infections remain mild, there are still long term unknowns involved. And there is still little reason to sympathize with those putting so many others at risk.

The notions held by many citizens that it is only their freedom to choose that matters is fraught. Society also has an obligation to protect its citizens--perhaps especially when it only requires a simple shot. Freedom is not a unipolar concept--societies also have the freedom (and at times obligation) to impose rules: <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative"" target=""_blank"">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative</a>/ .

I think there are myriad reasons for vaccine hesitancy or out and out rejection, and no one strategy will work for all.  Of course, those of us who were desperate for the vaccine have trouble relating or feeling empathy for those who choose to put their own lives---as well as the lives of anyone they come in contact with---in danger.

The worst category of non-vaxxers are the knee jerk followers of Donald Trump who seem to delight in thumbing their noses at societal norms and are driven by purely political reasoning.  Those are the ones we want to throttle because their ideology is helping to prolong a deadly disease that should be long gone here because of our vaccine surfeits."

The only test to drive action is the nature of the virus and the public health repercussions.  As a vaccinated person, I certainly have rights too, but the overarching action for a society is to get the virus under control.   No one lives in this country alone.  Should government remove all nonvaccinated people to towns for only them like we removed people from society who suffered from TB?  That does not sound like a feasible plan since the virus concentrations would only increase, killing more people.  No doubt some foolish and self-possessed unvaccinated people will try to sneak out of quarantine as though they had a special right to walk the Earth. 

Government must stop coddling ignorant people.  Get the vaccine or be barred from all public venues and the workplace.  I do not understand the option of ""weekly testing"".  How costly will that be? Fifty-two tests per year per unvaccinated person?  Infection and transmission might occur during the gap of 7 days.  We are chasing the potential of further mutation that could be far worse.

It's time for action.  Politicians like McConnel who ride the fence between public health and pandering do not deserve the leadership positions they want to hold on to."

You don’t have to get the free vaccine, but then you need to get tested every week for a nominal fee (let’s say $20).
All stores set aside at least half their hours for vaccinated people so that they can shop free of the threat posed by the unvaccinated.
All public events or institutions either (1) require proof of vaccination or a recent negative test or (2) make at least half their hours or events available to the vaccinated.

I have three children who are too young to receive the vaccine, parents in their late 70s who, while vaccinated, may not have produced a lot of antibodies given their ages, and a mother in law who, despite getting vaccinated, has been told she needs to act like she is not vaccinated because she has been undergoing chemotherapy so may not have built up any immunity. 

While my partner and I are trying our best to not be in close contact with any vaccine eligible people who are not vaccinated, we do not know the vaccine status of our coworkers or fellow grocery shoppers. In a couple of weeks we are attending an indoor wedding and we know of at least a couple of attendees who have chosen to not be vaccinated.

I’d suggest something similar with an anti-vax loved one. Ask if they prefer a burial or cremation. Ask if they have a will, a living will, life insurance, health insurance. Where do they keep their important papers, deeds, titles, etc. Where are their financial accounts located. Of course, this is a discussion everyone should have periodically, but it might be important to have it now - before they end up on a ventilator."

They repeat outrageous conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory. I’m told I read the wrong medical articles and that Dr Fauci should be in jail. Families are split between those who believe in science and those who don’t creating frustration and sadness. When history looks back at this time there will be no mistaking how the power of right wing misinformation and political grandstanding caused the morbidity and mortality of so many Americans.

I am sorry for the country that has done so well with developing the vaccine and making it widely available for free only to see a portion of people reject its benefits making us all more vulnerable. According to friends in Shanghai, on the streets in China they say 'America wants to live free or die  but we want to live, not die.' Adjusting human behavior to account for the common good of the country is necessary here. We cannot overwhelm our hospitals again. Macron limited the travel of the unvaccinated. Two days later 2 million people signed up to be vaccinated. We have to restrict the movement of the unvacicinated for the common good of country.

Those refusing to get vaccinated are a threat to the health and (economical) well-being of the community. It's time for measures. No more free ride: no shot, no access; you get sick, you pay. Every choice has a consequence."
2021-07-27 10:52:41,"I’m vaccinated. If people want to die of a preventable disease, be my guest. And regarding Delta, evidence out of Israel shows basically no uptick in hospitalizations or deaths among the vaccinated.

So I’m fine with letting the unvaccinated play Russian roulette. What surprises me is that Republican leaders don’t realize that their voters are dropping like flies and Democrats are not. Because honestly, Republicans wouldn’t do the right thing for their country on a dare, but they WOULD do the right thing for their party. 

Hey, all good by me."
2021-07-27 10:52:43,The tougher stance cannot backfire when people swear they’ll never be vaccinated.   Our problem isn’t being soft on crime.  Mollycoddling the ignorant is why we face so many crises.
2021-07-27 10:53:00,"Headline says this is a NEW feeling. Really? New, not counting the murderous policies of Trump, the behavior of those who scoffed at masks, the lies of the anti-vaxxers, the corruption of the PPP and other programs, the loss of jobs, the hundreds of thousands dead, the death of bricks and mortar stores and thus communities, the seeming inability of the CDC to understand human or viral behavior, the toxic rhetoric right-wing politicians, and the profit-making of social media selling misinformation. But, sure, we're just now feeling anger."
2021-07-27 10:53:14,"Vaccine mandates for employment or school. No exemptions.
Vaccine passports for everywhere else.
Massively increased insurance premiums for the unvaccinated.
No insurance coverage for hospitalization for the unvaccinated. 

That would just be for a start."
2021-07-27 10:53:19,"Under our laws, if someone assaults you, to the extent you land in the hospital, that someone would rightly be arrested and charge with assault. If you died as a result of that assault, that someone would rightly be arrested, charged with some level of homicide, and most likely held until trial.

Yet millions of unvaccinated people are currently being allowed to move about freely, and assault others, with no consequence.  How is this consistent with our criminal statutes?

Further, elected officials, and media figures, are aiding and abetting these potential and active lawbreakers. Elected officials are encouraging these active lawbreakers. How are elected officials and media figures allowed to freely encourage criminal activity?

Donald Trump deliberately and knowingly lied about the dangers of COVID-19 to the nation, to the world. How is Trump, and his Republican elected, appointed accomplices, and enabling media supporters, their donors, not being prosecuted for, at minimum, mass negligent homicide?

The unvaccinated, and those who encourage them, would certainly be found guilty of assault, of manslaughter, if they did to people with with their fists, with knives, with guns, what they are doing with their breath. The laws against violence focus on the consequences to the victim, not to the means of the crime.

Why are we not being consistent. I don't care why people are not getting vaccinated. I care about the consequences. Those consequences are demonstrably criminal."
2021-07-27 10:53:27,"Anger doesn't even describe it. It is rage, pure rage. I dread the day when (not if) unvaccinated people will breed a vaccine resistant strain, and everything starts again. The emotional, physical and economic burden will be too much for soooooo many."

Though I’m fully vaccinated I don’t think that gives me the right to badger unvaccinated people. At any rate, with new variants emerging very unlikely herd immunity will ever happen."
2021-07-27 10:54:15,"Partly it is sheer ignorance. I've heard ""I don't like needles"" and ""Oh, another way the government will control you."" Neither impresses me as a truth tantamount to NOT getting vaccinated. To me, those not getting vaccinated are irresponsible. I think I'm allowed to have that opinion when a carrier of a disease little understood carries lifetime or life threatening consequences. You are free not to care about yourself; that is your right. But, can you exist in society not caring about the welfare of others when you actions may be hazardous if not lethal?"
2021-07-27 10:54:45,The simple and proper solution is if you do not get vaccinated - i.e. have a card or in the system - then covid hospital costs are on you and no gov money can be used (one can't require that of private insurance but the individual companies can decide on their own w/o legal consequences.) Further all Federal workers should be required except for a medical condition

And the cost of their care will be spread around to all of us just like it is with everything else.  But we can not reward this attitude toward the rest of America.  If a college doesn't follow equal rights, their federal aid will be cut off.  How about a state like Louisiana or Alabama  that has a low vaccination rate has their federal assistance cut off.  Don't vacation in places that have low rates of vaccination.  That type of thing.  They don't have to get vaccinated.  We don't have to spend our money on them.  And how about an IRS deduction for being vaccinated?  There are many ways to make them pay.  And healthcare workers have to care for them.  But those workers KNOW these people refused vaccines.  And there won't certainly be any extras in the care.  ""The refrigerator is down the hall.  Get your own juice.""  I wouldn't have a problem with that.  Those people saved your life.  Their obligation ends right there."
2021-07-27 10:55:21,"We've tried the carrot, now it's time for the stick.

Apparently, this Southern generation must have been raised by parents that believed 'Spare the rod and spoil the child' and now as adults, this is all they will respond to.

Of course, these adults will act as children and protest, whine, and dither. If we try to be accommodating parents, they won't understand.

We can use France as a model. A large swath of their population acted as children, so the state had to get strict, and require vaccine proof for many daily activities.

And so should we."
2021-07-27 10:57:01,"There is a very good documentary about the the 1918 influenza outbreak in America (PBS-American Experience).

There didn't appear to be much hand wringing back then--it was an obligation to be vaccinated; to protect yourself, your family and your community.

It appears that much of this opposition to getting vaccinated is coming from baby boomers--the generation that was Woodstock-Yuppies-MAGA.

 What a selfish generation that we have become."
2021-07-27 10:57:41,"Unless you really can't get vaccinated because of some actual known risk or vulnerability, then you ARE breaking the social contract. The correct word for vaccine ""hesitancy"" is selfishness. Stop being a passenger and start rowing with the rest of us. I'm angry and my anger seems very reasonable."
2021-07-27 10:58:17,"Employers need to step up and mandate vaccinations as people return to work, especially if they employ coercive methods to get remote workers to return. 

I am sitting next to an unvaccinated person at work who, based on company policy, takes off their mask at her desk. I feel like a sitting duck and I am just waiting to get sick. Hopefully my mask protects me!"
2021-07-27 10:58:25,"Set a deadline.

Anyone not vaccinated by that date will have to pay out of pocket before they could treated for any covid relates illnesses.

Set the minimum consultation fee at $20,000.00 not refundable by any insurance company."
2021-07-27 10:59:23,"Mandates, however arrived at, is a win/win.  The refusniks can whine and complain they were ""forced"" to get the vaccine- ""what could I do""?  (I had to work/get paid.)  So they still have their ""argument"" and ""stand"" against the vaccine, but we all benefit too!"
2021-07-27 10:59:32,"The same is true here. As soon as Macron decided it should be mandatory to proof vaccination or a recent negative test to access many places,  some people voiced concerns about the freedom of people who didn't want to get vaccinated. 
What about the freedom of people who did get vaccinated ? Why should I risk a breakthrough infection sitting next to an unvaccinated person in a theater or elsewhere? Why should I have to go through more curfews or lockdowns because of them?
This is taking a toll on friendships. I am no longer seeing people who have not been vaccinated. One of my friends keeps saying, she's waiting. Sure, if she waits long enough, till 90 % percent of the population will be vaccinated, she will be safe thanks to others. 
I have no respect for this selfishness."
2021-07-27 10:59:33,"People should be turned away from medical care if they refused the vaccine and then caught Covid.  SS disability should be denied for long-termers who refused a Vaccine.

Set a date in the future, say September 30 of this year, and anyone not vaccinated by then who gets Covid after October 15 does not get treated and does not burden our health care.  Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance should just not cover care for that."
2021-07-27 10:59:59,"Out with the carrot, in with the stick. You don’t have the “freedom” to refuse the vaccine, if you are eligible, and then infect others. If you are eligible and refuse, then society has the right to tell you to stay away from others and to stay out of hospitals when you get sick. Those who are eligible and refuse are a deadly threat to the rest of us, to unvaccinated children, to health care workers, to fellow travelers on planes, etc. and they breed ever more potent variants. As far as I’m concerned, they are on their own and don’t deserve help from the rest of us when they fall ill.  They need to live with the choice they made. 

While the article, says that there are many reasons people refuse the vaccine, and refusal exists across the spectrum, the vast majority of refusals can be found in the conservative, Republican community. Their leaders have stoked the fires of government resentment and spread misinformation, disinformation and outright lies.  They don’t care one whit about the national welfare.  These are many of the people who say Jan. 6 was no big deal and that trump won. Maybe this plague is a sort of biblical vengeance. It’s beyond maddening that this country, and others, are held hostage by the worst among us."
2021-07-27 11:00:40,"Of course we are angry. This whole mess has been ten times worse than it could have been  with a united response based on science and common sense.  

Now more will sicken and more will die because so many are steering the gullible down a path to their own destruction.   

Why would we not be angry in the face of such evil?"
2021-07-27 11:00:42,"Yes, anger is mounting, understanably, especially for the well being of our children and grandchildren.  

Two thoughts about what to do.  

First, vaccine verification systems and software need to be developed, as in California for example, and used widely.  

Second, let's make it clear that fomenting vaccine resistance as a political tool is the cynical work of Trump Republicans, whether vaccinated or not, who believe that Biden and the Democrats can be defeated in 2022 if the pandemic persists.  Trump's incompetence on the issue led to his defeat; the competence of Biden's team on halting the pandemic, and economic restoration, is the Republicans biggest fear."
2021-07-27 11:00:55,"The people who do not want vaccines need to understand that they are killing others, including children who inexplicably are not entitled to vaccine protection and people with weakened immune systems. The new variants which have developed in Indonesia and Malaysia are becoming lethal to children.  

They are insisting on having the right and power to infect and kill others.  Maybe this makes them feel important.    

If I wanted to stand on a highway overpass and throw rocks at passing cars I would be stopped and charged with reckless endangerment and murder if I killed someone.  This would be the case even if I drove on a section of highway where others were throwing rocks at me.  These people are doing the same thing.  Just because they are willingly exposing themselves to having rocks thrown at them does not mean they have a right to throw rocks at others."
2021-07-27 11:01:31,"I don't understand what's taking so long, given all the results and evidence we know have, to fully approve the vaccines by FDC. What are they thinking? Setting that aside, it seems a little crazy to justify some sort of ""concern"" about mandating the vaccine. If the virus continues to mutate because of such anti-vaccinators not getting the shot, aren't we setting the stage for a much more virulent and deadly mutation that could result in another major wave of death that could be worse than the original? Science says that virus will continue to mutate and strengthen. Come on."
2021-07-27 11:01:42,"We are like the parent who is coddling the terrible behavior of a teenager, because we are afraid to step in and parent. Aside from getting sick, there needs to be clear, enforceable consequences. But when you have almost 100 Republicans Congresspeople refusing to even say if they’ve been vaccinated, then all we keep doing is pandering to the unvaxxed and letting their rotten behavior put the rest of us at risk."
2021-07-27 11:01:53,"If the insurance companies announced that they would no longer cover medical costs related to covid for unvaccinated people you’d see some movement. 

And yes, I’m angry. My husband and I got the vaccine as soon as we were able, which was fairly early because he is immune compromised and I am his sole caregiver. But we can’t freely go where we want and do what we want because we are not sure exactly how protected he is, considering his health issues. So we continue to live in a state of partial lockdown, and that is solely on the heads of the unvaccinated. I brought him through the worst of this, doing everything I could possibly do to make sure this disease didn’t enter our home. And now that the end is within our reach, these selfish selfish people are keeping us prisoner. I don’t want to hear about religious reasons or “concerns” about how fast it was developed. I will never forgive these people."
2021-07-27 11:03:28,"The only thing that Americans understand is money. From this point on anybody who is unvaccinated, the gets Covid-19 should pay the cost of the health services provided. 

The threat of a $250,000 hospital bill for a week to ten days on a ventilator should inspire some to get the shot.

After September 1st., charge $500 for the shot that should inspire the 26-year-old who is “taking my time with it.” She worries that there may be long-term side effects from the vaccines and that they were rushed to market.

Is this woman aware of the long-term effects of Covid?"
2021-07-27 11:03:36,"I find these arguments that use freedom as an excuse for selfishness to cheapen all our liberties.  I remember when young men were involuntarily drafted into the military and had to risk their lives for this country.  Many died.  The reticent were cajoled with the catch phrase “Freedom isn’t free”.  Yet, now some of our most conservative thinkers posit that citizens owe nothing to society.  They say we are all individually entitled to do whatever we want, even if it harms others.  I’m fully in favor of freedom, but not when your choices limit my freedom.  A military style draft, to isolate the unvaccinated with no age restrictions, would free the rest of us from potential new variants."
2021-07-27 11:03:38,"Institute a vax tax by dividing the number of cases, and the cost of care, by the number of people who won't get a shot (they are, presumably, too busy trying to figure out whether the Earth is flat) and make 'em pay. Astounding, really, that nearly half the population won't do this, after all we've been through."
2021-07-27 11:03:53,"We’re not really going to let the uneducated, scientifically illiterate segment of our society shackle people of reason and common sense to death, are we? Do something! 

This is getting more clear as time goes on. We can not argue logic to people who are not logical. We can not argue science to people who do not understand science. This is an early education problem of not teaching enough science, and has manifested in scientifically illiterate adults. People who can not tell the difference between even the most obvious truths or fictions. 

We should be done with this virus, and yet it rages on. Unvaccinated people not just are more likely to catch the virus themselves, but also more likely to transmit it to other people AND are more likely to allow the virus time to mutate creating another variant. If a variant arises that can get past our vaccines, it will have evolved in an unvaccinated person somewhere on this earth. 

Drinking alone is fine by our laws, but why is it that driving drunk is illegal? Because you can kill someone else. That’s what walking around unvaccinated is like. Freedom to kill other people with stupidity? What about my freedom to LIVE?!"

'close relative' to be around his 2 year old son:  what were you thinking?  There are small children who have died of COVID.

To the vaccine skeptic who said ""You have no right to judge me"" - 
Think again."
2021-07-27 11:04:27,"Once again, people have trouble separating TV from reality.  Remember when the swirly-haired guy was thought to be a great businessman? Pretty sure all this vaccine stuff came from X-Files episodes.  When entertainment is much more real to you than what you learned in school, or in your life, you need to realize that it’s a problem.  Many people don’t."
2021-07-27 11:04:29,"We're on -what-the third or fourth variation of the virus, each one more contagious and deadly.  It's the nature of virus to mutate.  The more virus in the population multiplying, the more inevitable that we'll soon see viruses that resist the vaccine better.  Nature will find a way.  So if the goal is to wipe us all out, armageddeon-style, the unvaccinated are doing a fine job.  The thing that angers me is watching these vaccine deniers lying in the hospital on ventilators. Oh, we're sorry now, they say.  Everyone, get vaccinated now, they say.  Meantime, their medical care cost is, oh, 2-3 million dollars and counting.  They'll never be the same again and the health care system will have to pay.  The system will be bankrupted by covid patients.  No lung replacements for you, chronic smokers.  And don't have a heart attack, folks.  If ""folks"" want choices, maybe they could opt out of getting the vaccine and their health insurance for covid -related illness too in writing at the same time.  We could encourage them to opt out with a gift of a complimentary oxygen tank.  Then they could enjoy the ""mild"" symptoms of covid in the comfort of their own homes without destroying health care for the responsible citizens."
2021-07-27 11:04:52,"Anger?  More like infuriated and frightened!  Infuriated at their willful refusal to get vaccinated to protect their families, health care workers, fellow citizens and the world.  Infuriated at their willful ingestion of disinformation and their joy in sharing the GQP's damaging lies.  Infuriated at their belittling and excoriating us (i.e., sane, rational adults) over COVID and, well, just about everything.   Their joining in the denial of climate change has brought forth floods, fires, droughts, displacement and death.

These obstinate, low-information people with a rigid certitude that they know everything (Dunning-Kruger?) - when they actually know little - is literally killing us, our democracy and our planet."
2021-07-27 11:04:56,"We need to be angry, really angry at the religious, political and media leaders who're exploiting a population's ignorance and faith in THEM for personal and political gain. Conservative media and politicians that insist on politicizing public health to maintain and exacerbate divisions are guilty of something very close to murder.  Exploiting people who have utter faith in their leaders is ultimately causing their deaths.   When COVID has run its course there will likely be several hundred thousand unnecessary deaths because of this exploitation of faith."
2021-07-27 11:05:22,"The professor wants 'honest' dialogue but then says people are in an echo chamber. And That's the problem- you can't have ANY dialogue with people that have walled themselves into a chamber and don't want to hear anything that contradicts their nonsense. Start making them pay for their decisions- double their health insurance premiums, bar them from public events, etc. With their 'freedom' and choices come consequences. Isn't that what conservatives are always saying?"
2021-07-27 11:08:44,"It's no secret that there is a significant correlation between vaccine-hesitancy or outright opposition to the Coronavirus vaccine and being a Republican.   On the one hand, this is explicable by Republicans' penchant for conspiracy-theories and hostility to facts and science.  But, on the other, it also has everything to do with the Republican philosophy of hostility to anything that tends to promote the common good.  The very idea of members of a community or a society working together to create a better world is deeply offensive to them.  It is not so much ""individualism"" and ""freedom"" that Republicans value as much as being antisocial on principle and as an assertion of their right to be antisocial.  That is why they are proving to be so successful at destroying the social fabric of our society.  The resurgence of Covid19 is only the latest result of their nihilistic worldview and sociopathic behavior."
2021-07-27 11:09:14,"My children (under 12 and not eligible for the vaccine) attended a 30-person camp last week. Campers were in small pods of 6 and mask wearing was strictly enforced indoors. And yet there was a COVID outbreak among kids and counselors, at least 3 children testing positive so far and the health department has asked us all to quarantine. This was 30 kids in masks following strict hand washing and staying in small groups. Our school system of 100,000 students opens in 2 weeks — I am scared for our kids. The delta variant seems like a whole new beast better able to get past these safe guards. And yes, I am so angry that my children will enter a 3rd year of compromised education and lost socialization and health anxiety because people won’t put the greater good of the community above their own personal preference. It’s disheartening and infuriating. We now have a way to “get back to normal” and folks aren’t doing it - many times the same folks who were loudest and most insistent on us “getting back to normal” when all this started. Baffling that we now have this ability and aren’t doing it. Where do we go from here?"
2021-07-27 11:09:37,"To Mr. Perldeiner, why on earth would you subject your unvaccinated child to a frequent visitor who refuses to be vaccinated? Grow a spine and deny her access to your family."
2021-07-27 11:10:06,"You bet the anger is real. After four years of simmering anger over the Trump reign, we thought we'd finally found way out of the darkness, but now we find that isn't so. We look around and find we are now threatened by low information citizens who somehow think they are smarter than scientists. As a recent internet meme suggested, they have been smoking, drinking and eating heavily processed foods their entire lives, but now are worried about ""what's in"" the vaccine!"
2021-07-27 11:10:35,"It's hard to believe that we have taken 5 leaps forward and now at least 10 back.  I am an American, love my country and always will but am happy to be living in Ireland where anti-vac feeling is low and 80% of the population is vaccinated.  And to add good news to that, the young people here are following suit.  We also have vaccination passports throughout the continent so we can travel freely if we wish and now our own restaurants are requiring them for indoor dining.  I know that some people would say that this is anti-civil liberties, etc.   I rather be on a plane or in a restaurant feeling safe than  worrying about Covid. But if everyone had done the right thing from day one, maybe we would be in this situation nearly 2 years later."
2021-07-27 11:10:43,"Simply, you get vaccinated or you stay home. You show up in public and it’s a $1000 fine or you are vaccinated. We have no more patience for you putting us all at risk."

2021-07-27 11:11:54,"It is difficult not to be angry in the face of obstinate ignorance. I have reconciled myself to the notion that we eventually will get to herd immunity. Unfortunately, many unvaccinated people will have to get sick and die in order to get there. A sorry commentary on our country and the masses willingly being exploited by dangerous voices in the media, politics, and our community."
2021-07-27 11:12:25,The solution is simple: if you are unvaccinated insurance  companies should not be required to cover the costs of care/hospitalization if you become ill.

Penalties for non compliance: 1. loss of government benefits 2. loss of tax deductions 3. suspension of all licenses such as drivers, law, medical. 4. No entry to mass transit, airplanes, restaurants, theaters, schools, universities, gyms, office buildings and other public facilities. 5 escalating fines 6. increase in medical insurance rates.

2021-07-27 11:15:01,"There's a 61-year old right-wing radio host who told his audience not to get vaccinated unless they have other conditions.  So, he caught the virus and is now hospitalized in critical condition. He himself didn't get vaccinated, probably because he considers himself such a fine, manly specimen.  Now he's being taught a valuable lesson as he goes on a ventilator every night in the hospital.  Or not.  With breathtaking cognitive dissonance, he insists he's not ""one of those anti-vaxxers.""  My level of sympathy for him can be described as thinning of the herd, grateful a drunk driver himself was injured, schadenfreude, anger.

The Maryland professor worries that vaccine mandates backfire.  I disagree.  We don't need to spare anti-vaxxers feelings as they play Russian roulette with our lives."

Yet we are heading towards a 4th wave in the fall because of a minority who refuse to take the vaccine and a government that refuses to enact a vaccine mandate. The frustration is palpable. Time for the conspiracy theory holdouts to stay home and let the rest of us resume our lives."
2021-07-27 11:15:53,"I got vaccinated as soon as I possibly could, and my whole family is vaccinated as well.  Although I do harbor some resentment against people who have not been vaccinated, I think this new ""anger"" toward the unvaccinated comes uncomfortably close to hatred.  Just look at all the comments suggesting that people who have not been vaccinated should be denied all benefits, including health care and treatment if they get COVID!  This attitude is being promoted on  cable news shows and in newspapers, and I think it's purpose is to deflect the public's resentment away from government policy.  Governors and mayors (both Democrats and Republicans) rushed to open everything up with no social distancing requirements and no mask mandates as soon as COVID cases started coming down in the Spring.  Meanwhile, they knew the Delta variant and other dangerous variants were coming.  The CDC even decided not to keep track of how many vaccinated people get breakthrough infections, unless they are hospitalized or die. Personally, I would appreciate knowing how likely I am to get infected even though I'm vaccinated, but apparently the CDC does not want me to know that.

Neither should the government.

Fully vaxed, kicking myself for not waiting until I could get bribed.

In the 1918 flu, it died out when it had no more susceptible people.  These heroic measures to keep people who became infected with COVID-19 alive may actually enable the rise of more super variants.

Others who must take responsibility for this debacle include Fox talking heads who knowingly lie about the safety and efficacy of vaccines... Tucker, Laura and Sean come to mind.  Odd that these folks all shout and beat their breasts about being ""patriotic"" while encouraging behavior which is anything but. To them I say, ""Remember Lee Atwater"".  Don't count on a late in life repentance.
If people don't want to get vaccinated, none of us should care if they get sick and die.  Offering incentives to take a free vaccine is is akin to giving someone a gift and them turning around and asking how much you will pay them to take it..... fuggedaboutit.
Let's focus on protecting those who care about living; some thoughts: 
Let's take a page from the Italian government; as of August 6th, entry to stadiums, museums, theatres, cinemas, exhibition centers, swimming pools and gyms will only be allowed upon presentation of a “green pass”, i.e. those vaccinated.  As for US churches: let only those vaccinated come into church; offer virtual attendance for the unvaccinated. According to the Bible, Jesus healed the sick, He didn't make them sick."

If anyone cares to remember, last year several GOP politicians stated in no ambiguous terms that it was OK to keep the economy open in spite of the pandemic, and if some of them older citizens died, oh well. Many people actually said the same thing.

Then those rationalizing that the vaccine was developed too quickly to be clearly safe. Never mind the decades of scientific discoveries that made the quick effort possible.

Then there are still those who claim COVID is a hoax. Until they get sick. And we all pay their ICU bills with tax dollars. And then they claim that the vaccine is still not worth it.

In other words, conservatives are willing to die and kill us in the process of reasserting their ""freedom"" (whatever that means after you died).

So let me just ask this: how, oh HOW can we even begin to run a country where half their population have jumped off such a deep end that they won't be able to come back from it?

The proverbial ""chicken"" has now come home to roost: their constituents are now dying of Covid, or worse....they will become long haulers.

At the same time, I don't think the outright rejection of the vaccine by many (including within the rural region where I live) is an overnight phenomenon, and instead is partly the result of chronic educational under funding and a very real and deep science illiteracy. I've had and been privy to many conversations about COVID-19 and the vaccines where basic and core components of biology are misunderstood, unknown, or the participants simply never had been exposed to them. While the mandates may be quicker, and I think are critical at this point, there's a real structural, embedded resistance that can only be overcome by more education, investment, and organizing within these communities."

Now a year and a half into covid-times that began with an inability to heed warning signs and then undergo some short-term pain we have 600,000+ dead in this country alone. We are seeing groups of vaccinated getting sick, usually with mild symptoms, and we have no idea about their potential for long covid. This is due a covid variant, a mutation, that we knew was coming because that is what viruses do. We learn that in high school biology. Eventually, probably sooner than later, we'll see a vaccine to overcome variants or we'll see millions more died, the vaccinated among them. How's that for a backlash?"

At sixty seven and seventy two the thought that our remaining years of good health may be spent in virtual lockdown is beyond frustrating.

And to add fuel to the already burning fire of frustration, yesterday we learned that our governor wants to call a special session of the Legislature to actually craft a law forbidding school districts to require masks-even for those mot vulnerable.    And why not?   The courts have already sided with him over the CDC guidelines for cruise ships-as in there can't be any!

They are putting the vulnerable (the young and those with compromised immune systems) in a bad situation. Based on their poor choices our healthcare system remains overstretched which means other conditions get overlooked or are ignored. Healthcare premiums will have to rise for everyone because the anti-vaxxers are driving up costs. We'll have to continue wearing masks till who knows when because of them. Ironically they'll be the only ones not wearing masks, because, well, that's their twisted idea of good citizenship.

You also don't deserve to eat in a restaurant, go to a movie theater, museum, etc...Enough is enough. Reimposing mask mandates, while probably necessary now thanks to the unvaccinated creeps in this country, is also bending to their needs and accommodating them. It should be the other way around.

2021-07-27 11:32:20,"I am trying to channel my anger towards the unvaccinated into a Swiftian proposal. How about this one:

We resume ""gain of function"" research into making viruses stronger with a view to producing a corona virus which is deadlier than Delta but not vaccine resistant. Then we let it loose. We wouldn't have to pressure the undecided anymore. We could let them take their time deciding while gasping for breath. 

If you think my proposal is too mordant just remember: the virus itself is almost certainly mutating as we speak. And higher morbidity is certainly a possible mutation given enough time and laxity regarding vaccination. 

Not to mention the Chinese and Russians are almost certainly doing this research already. They can see we have a fifth column that is holding up vaccination. They don't. That gives them a unique opportunity to permanently weaken the US and strengthen their relative position. 

Isn't it weird that the same people who believe COVID started as a lab leak from a germ warfare lab in China tend to fear the one thing that would help them in the event of germ warfare from China? But I guess magical thinking knows no bounds. It is magic, after all...."
2021-07-27 11:32:29,"It is infuriating that those of us who got vaccinated immediately when the vaccines became available did so because we care about our own health, and the health of those around us. We were’t offered lottery tickets or entrance to a Major League Baseball game or free beer; we did it because it was the right thing to do. The fact that the recalcitrant vaccine-hesitant among us are putting themselves and those vaccinated at risk is deplorable. 

You’re not permitted to get blotto drunk and drive around; why are the unvaccinated permitted to mix with the rest of us and put the entire society at risk, particularly with the Delta variant circulating?

Does anyone who is concerned with other people’s safety make the decision to engage in street racing (something I can hear happening at least once a week near me)?  Do the laws against street racing really harm any responsible person’s “freedom”?

I am not yet angry about people who make the choice to not get the vaccine.  I can understand if someone has a medical condition that would be a significant health concern as wishes to avoid the vaccine.  But, those who are making the poor choice to not get it who easily could, they should directly bear the cost themselves if they do get Covid.  To push that expense onto all of us who have gotten the shot, through increases to our health insurance or higher taxes, is wrong.

I can remember when I purchased my own health insurance (not through a employer), and was asked about if I smoked, what my height and weight were (to get an estimate of my body mass index) and any long term conditions I had.  The answers to these questions determined how much I had to pay for a policy, not whether my “freedom” was being taken away.

2021-07-27 11:32:56,"For all the Darwin doubters (and I am sure that includes many anti-vaxxers) note that we are currently witnessing natural selection in its purest form.  Stone Age humans needed to avoid getting eaten by saber-tooth tigers; those with the right mix of gene variations; a little better eyesight, a little better hearing, faster legs, etc.  escaped.  While the slower, poorer sighted, less acute, met their fate and their gene contribution to the human race ended.   

Same with COVID-19 and present day humans.  In our age, humans need to know how to cross a street without getting hit, not to touch live electrical wires and how to protect their bodies from micro-organisms.   Perhaps washing our hands in an ancient stream was the first step in that direction.  

The parallel is clear:  those absent the cognitive thinking abilities that inform a person to get a vaccine are the ones who will not pass on their genes.  They will die, and while some will have procreated, many will have not, thus reducing the anti-vax gene pool through natural selection."

My sister-in-law then sits in the house while some of us are gathering outdoors. Doesn't she know that it's more dangerous indoors? Apparently not, but she gets miffed if no one wants to keep her company. There's a tension that takes the joy from getting together. Infuriating and sad.

How long much longer until we have a variant that is ‘Indonesia Bad’? What has to happen to protect my child?”

Hopefully you have decent enough insurance to pay your medical bills or you perfectly navigate the sea of collectors and that you’re able to escape financial ruin. 

For those afraid of the untested long term effects of the vaccine, please consider these tested long term effects:

(1) Being responsible for someone else’s death or long term illness

(2) Your own death or lasting illness

(3) Financial ruin

Yes. Anger is the operative word here and harsh measures should be taken against those who are too stupid or cowardly to take a simple shot in the arm. Tax them, refuse to allow them to fly, go to movies, sports events, school, church, or even Costco, Walmart or Target.

Or else they can shut my gas off.  I had to wait 2 1/2 hours for a call back and then was told I can reschedule if the person who shows up hasn't been vaccinated.  Why is a major company whose thousands of employees have that much public contact not requiring them to be vaccinated?
2021-07-27 11:40:25,"A bottom line that should reassure the vaccinated is that the vaccine works against the current iterations of COVIS-19 and that hospitalization and death occur rarely in the fully vaccinated population.  That said the people refusing to be vaccinated are putting others at risk that includes the immunocompromised, children, and rarely fully vaccinated.  The excuse being used by the refusniks is fatuous at best and self-serving.  Requesting that they be respected for their choices is truly inane.  
There have been several suggestions to ""encourage"" them to be vaccinated and all have some degree of merit.  Mandates may work for some in certain situations and should be used.  Withholding insurance coverage for hospitalized unvaccinated patients is draconian but might work in a few cases.  The fact that the GOP made this a political issue and did nothing little to encourage their base to be vaccinated should be remembered in the voting booth.
I watched a video of McConnell trying to blame Biden for the failure to get more vaccinated and his ""logic"" aka lies, was political theater at its worst.  
In the final analysis, the unvaccinated represents the worst in our society: poorly educated, uninformed, gullible, and politicized.  We all fail if this is our ""society's "" response to a crisis as 40% of the people willingly ignore what is best for all and choose only their selfish interests.  We are not one nation."

I think Biden needs to take a two prong attack:  I give Biden an F- for not encouraging popular entertainers from show biz to sports stars taking to the airwaves promoting vaccination.

Most Americans get motivated by any measure affecting their wallets.  We should impose stiff tax penalties if proof of of vaccination cannot be provided.  The tax penalties should start immediately (not tax time) by imposing high withholding from payroll.

Unfortunately, Republicans would vote as a solid block to kill any such measure to avoid alienating Trump supporters.  Even if by some miracle legislation for tax penalties was passed it would most likely be set too low to have much of an impact."
2021-07-27 11:40:36,"Got antibodies?

I do. So, why get vaccinated?

I was extremely ill with Covid-19 and the vaccine does not provide any further improvements to the antibodies I already have. 

Why is no one even mentioning the many people who have already been sick and have antibodies which is what the vaccines are supposed to help create?

I have had more vaccines than anyone else I personally know since I have travelled all over the world. 
I am not an anti-vaxxer by ANY means. 
Still, as someone with a medical history of asthma and who has ALREADY had Covid, I see no point in getting vaccinated now. 

If I had not been so sick with Covid, I would probably have received the vaccine. 
But now it will not do anymore for me than my own immune system has already done. 

Neither will it provide any greater measure of protection for those around me. 

I personally know someone who had a terrible, life-changing reaction to the vaccine. So, I am wary of the vaccines for those unlike myself who have not already had Covid.

About anger: it fouls social discourse and hinders clarity. It creates bitter self righteousness. 

Having, like Jonah, been inside the Covid whale for 5 long weeks, I want to tell you inflammatory emotions and activities like anger can weaken your own ability to fight COVID-19. 

Protect yourselves: strive to be peaceful and keep healthy habits.
Employ social distance.

I’m sick of them and their misunderstanding of what freedom means. I’m sick of their right wing enablers on talk radio and most of all their propaganda channel Fox. We’ve tried being understanding. We’ve tried pleading with them and offering them goodies if they just develop a social conscience and get vaccinated. None of it has worked. They remain as defiant as ever. Giving them consequences in the form of job loss, no travel, no school attendance, no anything is the only answer at this point.

I also feel a little sorry for people who are afraid of vaccines or who have had reactions to previous vaccines.  But not a lot. Because it all comes down to the science and a little math.

The science on vaccines, including this one, is solid. If there were significant problems we’d know it by now.  Then there’s the math, or more correctly, basic statistics. If basic statistics were taught in high school instead of algebraic quadratic equations (which 98% of people never use again) maybe more people would understand sample sizes and probability and that getting the shot is a lot better than contracting a potentially fatal disease.

Or maybe not.  At least 40-50 million people still think Trumpy is perfect and are willing to die for him, so maybe Delta, and the next three, Echo, Fox and Golf, will prove Darwin right and help trim the gene pool a bit."

We are a society, bound together in our survival. It's time these people decide whether they want to be a part of it or if they want to shoulder the costs of their selfishness alone."

You had to have them to enter any country . The point is, vaccines were mandatory in the military—no if’s, ands or buts.

There always has been, and would be, a small number of unvaccinated people by choice or circumstance. But that small number would be taken care by ""herd immunity"" where the vast numbers of those who were vaccinated would help insure that the virus couldn't get a societal foothold and spread and mutate.

But the death cult puts all its effort into seeing that that herd immunity cannot happen. 

Further, those who were skeptical or refused who later get sick and go on the news telling people that they had made a terrible mistake and to get the vaccine before it is too late are ignored, and even ridiculed as traitors to the death cult.

And then as a political coup de grace blame Biden for not making the virus go away while saying they won't be forced or convinced to take the vaccine. The death cult literally sacrifices people so it can blame others for their deaths.

While this is true, and an understandable reaction, what angers me about this is a bigger issue:  vaccinated people are also being put at risk, as are people who are too young, or immunocompromised, and we can't squash the virus while it continues to spread widely and mutates to escape the immunity conferred by the vaccine."

What this article should have reported is that when Macron instituted the vaccine passport in France to be required for all public settings, the next day 3.7 million people booked vaccinations appointments, a record. 

There's your ""backlash."" Let's follow the Macron example!"
2021-07-27 11:52:39,"Obviously, no one can be forced against their will to be vaccinated. So the thing to do is to withhold access to funds nd government facilities. If you are unvaccinated, you are not eligible for stimulus checks that are meant to support you and kickstart the economy. You cannot go to school (where, you HAVE to be vaccinated for childhood diseases, and now covid should be included) you cannot fly. If you lose time from work because you have covid and refused to get vaccinated, you forfeit pay, if you get sick and are in hte hospital, all pay is out of pocket, and you cannot enter an airport or board a plane. I think this is reasonable."
2021-07-27 11:53:06,Why hasn’t the FDA lifted its emergency authorization on the vaccine?? That in itself would go far in helping people feel comfortable with the studies and it helps employers mandate the shots.

2021-07-27 11:53:30,"We are digging our own graves without knowing its purpose until it is too late.  This is unaccepted.

Federal government should lead us to a safer ground. We already declared national emergency. Why can't we mandate vaccine inoculations nationwide?  This is a pandemic. As a senior that my immunity is weak, I am vulnerable to virus attack and don't want to live and co-exist with the viruses.

Harsh lockdowns or soft lockdowns, it is not patented by China. We can do similar things that can result fabulous outcome.  I already stay home more than a year.  And the situation is not promising.  If we don't take some drastic move, we are in this perpetual war for a long time."
2021-07-27 11:53:47,"This issue  is twofold:
As a result of lagging vaccination and lifted restrictions, infections are rising. 
Local and Federal authorities lifted the restrictions ' that is their bad and they can rectify the issues they caused by their rush to appease the unvaccinated.  Like reintroducing Mask Mandates and Distancing indoors. The introduction of a Vaccine Passport which should have been done from the start. Cease molly coddling the vaccine hold outs, enough of the free lottery ticket and trans pass nonsense .
As to those who refuse to be vaccinated  unless for Medical Reasons they should be denied  access to 'All'  indoor activities be they bars , cafes, places of entertainment , travel , shopping at the mall etc. In addition the Insurance companies should refuse to reimburse the cost of their medical care. 
I have not a single doubt in my mind that the introduction of these  measures these very  self centered  people will get the message.  That what  they feel are their individual rights do not entitle them to make their fellow citizens sick or upend the economy."
2021-07-27 11:53:59,"The worst part is that antivaxxers are endangering not just themselves but also chronically ill people and children under 12. My honest take is that we should be required to attach a copy of our vaccination cards to tax returns this year to receive tax credits. Additionally, anyone with no reason to not vaccinate who failed to do so by end of 2021 should be barred from all taxpayer-funded health programs, as they're a willing drain on public resources. I would also support vaccination card checks at public libraries, as they often have events for families. Plus, insurance companies should be permitted to kick antivaxxers off their plans due to aforementioned resource drain concerns. 

The time for humoring them has passed. Antivaxxers already caused a measles outbreak at a Disney World before the pandemic, and I do not want to consider what other diseases they may revive. Plus, these people are endangering young children like my brother by going about their lives without a care in the world. If they won't listen to reason, I think that they should not be subsidized by vaccinated taxpayers like me and they should not be the next cause of jacked-up insurance premiums. If carrots didn't work, sticks should be brought out, for the good of chronically ill folks and young children."
2021-07-27 11:54:24,"And GOP lawmakers in Washington are now starting to urge people to get vaccinated. I presume someone pointed out to them that most of the folks that are now dying are their voters.

Too cynical?"
2021-07-27 11:54:39,"People need to step up and get the shot, not just for themselves but for their loved ones and those that they don't know.

It's easy to say that you're okay with being sick if you get the virus, but what about those that will be taking care of you, can you live with the knowledge that you might have killed someone else?"
2021-07-27 11:54:53,"if unvaccinated people followed the CDC guidelines and wore masks their decision to remain unvaccinated while regrettable would be understandable. They would at least be trying to stop the spread from them to others. however, unvaccinated and unmasked seem to go together

I would love if the NYT published stats on this. how many unvaccinated are following CDC guidelines. my guess is that it is exceedingly low.

I personally think a better solution are the 'I'm vaccinated ' stickers... if you're then unmasked with no sticker we all know to walk to the other side of the street to avoid the germs you are probably spreading"
2021-07-27 11:55:01,"Here's what airlines should do.  If you have proof  of full vaccination you get seated in the front part of the aircraft.  If you don't - it is the back of the plane for you.   I don't want to sit next to an unvaccinated person, mask or no mask."
2021-07-27 11:55:21,"We have become a nation of me me me, forget about you. It’s been brewing for many years and the pandemic has just brought it to a boiling point.  I don’t think any sort of prodding or convincing is going to change the minds of many of these individuals who refuse to get the vaccine."
2021-07-27 11:55:30,"Antivaxers believe it is a ""freedom"" not to participate in public health?  Make the willful unvaccinated pay for all societal benefits on their own.   

Republican legislators across the country want to impose drug testing as a condition for government assistance, let's follow that led.   Not only eliminate government assistance for COVID related illnesses of the willfully unvaccinated (those who can be vaccinated), but make all Federal government assistance conditional for COVID vaccination--no housing assistance, no Medicaid, no federally backed up loans, no social security.   Deny access public facilities where the virus can spread to the willful unvaccinated and society has an interest to prevent infection, no public transportation, no access to Federally owned public lands and no public schools receiving Federal funding.   The Republicans set a precedent on conditional public assistance, the willful unvaccinated can live with the ramifications.

Antivaxers, the willful unvaccinated, don't want to participate in public health?   The public has its interests to protect, give the willful unvaccinated a date, after which society turns its collective back on them."
2021-07-27 11:55:31,I don’t worry about the unvaccinated.  Their choice and their suffering if they get sick.  My friends who refused to get the vaccine say  “why do you care if the vaccine works?”.  I tend to agree.
2021-07-27 11:55:47,"No, it is not ""some people"".  It is the fault of right wing politicians and their media.  And their low information, easily misled, always aggrieved audience."

2021-07-27 11:56:24,"Education is important.  The refusers in my extended family have no science education and of course thought the school Health & Home and Careers classes that included sanitation in food prep and hand washing after toileting was too much work for nothing.  You cannot get thru to people who don't understand germ theory and are not held accountable for their actions.  

And you can't blame people who live far away from a vax site.  Newburgh NY, a yellow zone for the longest time, didn't even run busses over to the state and county vax sites that opened. The state didn't open a site downtown.  The nonelderly waited months to get vax sites they could get to without a huge taxi bill.  Meanwhile, Medicare, in an effort to keep the ER load down, gives free taxi rides to people who won't pay for the taxi or bus so they can get to their doctor appointment. Priorities clearly askew."
2021-07-27 11:56:41,"Deny treatment except palliative care to the unvaccinated. Or make them pay double.  And don't tell me it's unethical. The Hippocratic oath says ""do no harm"". It doesn't speak to what you charge or how you do triage."

I do not dare try to engage in any conversation whatsoever about it. As I have seethed in anger for months now about his dangerous and harmful ideas, I have somehow managed to detach from him. I may understand what happened in my mind someday, but for now I am really enjoying the feeling of freedom I have from that emotional stone I have been carrying."
2021-07-27 11:57:01,"The anger, rage and fear directed at those who are not vaccinated is as frightening, if not more so, than the virus itself."
2021-07-27 11:57:38,"This article needed to be written--thanks.

In my career, I worked in rare disease research.  I think about all those with any of the 6000+ rare diseases who could easily die if/when Covid is added to their already substantial disease burden.  For many of those who are under 12, who cannot be vaccinated, the actions of the selfish unvaccinated are anathema.

Your piece gave me a new insight into the comment by the GOP governor of Alabama; her quote: “It’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.”  Flash back to McCain's VP candidate, who was known to call the lunatic fringe ""Real Americans.""  Though Gov. Ivy likely doesn't realize it, she's corrected that mistake.  She calls us vaccinated ""regular folks.""  So she admits that those influenced by conspiracy theories who pass on vaccinations are not ""regular,"" but rather someone else entirely.   About time everyone recognized just how irregular these folks are.  I understand how/why ""regular folks"" are angry at them."
2021-07-27 11:57:50,"Many of these people claim that they are worried about the long term effects of the vaccine to their health.  

What about those who:
smoke
are overweight
have type II diabetes
have high blood pressure
never exercise
eat nothing but junk food
drink two six packs a day

And they are worried about their health?  Are you kidding me?

You can do all of these things and cause dozens of debilitating and life threatening conditions.  But they affect only you.  Not taking the vaccine affects everyone else.  It puts all others at risk and it costs us a fortune to care for those who get sick.  

Communicable diseases are PUBLIC health problem , not a PRIVATE health problem.  That's the difference.  They are a threat to the national economy, not just any one persons income.  

Patriotism is a communal goal, not an individual goal.  These people are patriots to only themselves, not to the nation, not to their neighbors, not to their community.

The unvaccinated show us what happens to a society that is flooded by lies for profit and power.  When some untruths are used as political weapons, all truth is damaged.  The truth of the safety, purpose and efficacy of the vaccines have been ruined because of this onslaught of lies."
2021-07-27 11:57:58,"The rise in cases has also prompted discussions about possible booster shots for senior citizens such as myself.  I have to ask, why should I have to get THREE shots just because a bunch of selfish people won't even get ONE?"
2021-07-27 11:58:17,"Many of the unvaccinated in NYC receive assistance. Why is it so wrong to hold them to a requirement to receive the assistance paid for by me and others who did get vaccinated, doubts or not, I did it because I felt and still do that it's our best bet for our safety and the betterment of society. Yes I'm angry and while I'm at it, the media needs to quit painting the unvaccinated as Trump supporters. Both here and in red states a sizable portion of the resisters are from a voting block who votes left religiously. Not a word is said about their refusals. If you want to end divisions, tribalism and stalled legislature, give the same analysis and criticism to these people as you do for the whacked out Trumpers."

2021-07-27 11:58:56,"Didn’t we already go through this for weeks after the November election:  ‘Trump needs time to come to terms with what has happened; let’s give him that time’.

Why are we waiting to withhold privileges from folks who are willfully ignorant of facts?  No stimulus checks; no entry to school/college without a vaccine; no indoor anything:  gyms; dining; movies; shopping.  It’s positive peer pressure and behavior change based on structural motivation.

Time to make life as challenging and full of barriers as possible until hesitants and ignorants do what is needed for the many, not simply themselves."
2021-07-27 11:59:35,"Many of us who got the vaccination early were scared too. The vaccine was new, untested over time. But bravely we went ahead and did it, for ourselves sure, but also because it was the right and civic-minded thing to do. Just as wearing a mask and stopping at red light are not personal choices, nor is the vaccine. When (if!) this is all over, it will be difficult for me to forgive those who showed such selfish disregard for the well-being of my family, my community and myself with their “personal choice.”"
2021-07-27 12:00:01,"I'm not as angry with the unvaccinated as with the left wing hypsters who implied the vaccine actually worked, then changed their story to make us vaccinated folks fearful of actually getting the disease. They hyped the 94% number, which they now disclaim.

2021-07-27 12:00:10,"My friend apparently has an irrational fear of putting a foreign substance into their body.  They’re very health conscious. Exercise multiple hours everyday. They are also very social, going out to youthful dance parties and visiting covid-friendly places like Florida and recently Provincetown, MA.  They think they contracted Covid in early  2020 in Florida. They can’t see their children, grandchildren, and siblings. They understand the risks, and the social consequences, but they cannot bring themselves to get the jab.  Irrational. They need a bigger stick to help them get past their fear I’m afraid. Like a small child who has that tantrum at the doctor’s office."

Poisoning themselves with cheap unhealthy food. Paying astronomical amounts for healthcare delivered by an industry that has a corrupt government doing its bidding. Paying taxes that fund war and corporate profit and do nothing to make lives better. But the vaccine? That’s where they draw the line. Because they are FREE."
2021-07-27 12:01:07,Reading through the comments I think everyone is forgetting the fact that none of the vaccines have full approval yet. Not even the military is allowed to mandate them at this stage. My personal feelings aside it’s just plain wrong to demand that anyone have an experimental pharmaceutical product injected into their body.
2021-07-27 12:02:09,"“We are already in isolated, siloed information systems, where people are in their own echo chambers.”

2021-07-27 12:02:55,"I'm fed up with ""coddling"". We had to pass a law to get people to wear seat belts. I think it was the lawsuits on smoking that started it all. A warning on every pack rather than ban that took years for public spaces to be able to barr smokers with legal backing only relatively recently. And still, they smoke and think vaping is an easy out. Let's do the seat belt example. And NO religious exemption, just bonifide health reasons as rigorous as having to have a prior authorization issued by your insurance company. Insurers are interested in not paying out and would rather pay for the shot than a hospital stay."
2021-07-27 12:03:16,"Vaccine hesitancy does occur the political and cultural spectra, but it clearly concentrates at the bottom of the intellectual pool. There are surveys after surveys showing that the degree of vaccine hesitancy inversely correlates with the educational attainment, but no one so far got brave enough to run the same against the polygenic intelligence scores. Well, just the level of the  arguments put forth by the anti-vaxxers, and the glaring cognitive and analytical deficiencies that they exhibit render a formal anti-vaxxer GWAS rather superfluous. 
Lemme give you one example. My lab comprises 10 PhDs in molecular biology disciplines, 2 MD/PhDs, and 5 PhD students. All were lining up for vaccinations in January, as soon as these were offered. I recall NY Times had a report about that - how ""elite  medical centers"" in NY offered vaccinations to their postdocs and graduate students ahead of their formal eligibility. What was omitted from that report at the time is that these elite medical centers got their allocations of vaccine for the clinical staff, but had trouble vaccinating anyone without an MD. As vaccines were set to expire, and to boost overall herd immunity among the staff, vaccines were offered to and eagerly accepted by the research personnel. You can lead a horse to the water, they say. There's another one, about teaching pigs to whistle."

2. The more cases out there, the more likely other people---including a small but non-trivial number of the vaccinated and previously infected will get sick
3. Kids. Other people's kids if you don't care about your own. Other people's kids will get sick. Some will be very ill and all will be breeding grounds for more and different variants

The rise of a carnival barker from Queens proved me wrong. Many of our fellow citizens are easily hoodwinked all of the time and covid is proof of my hypothesis. 

The vaccine, save for a few instances, is safe and somewhat effective in comparison to the alternative-dying from covid or causing others to die. 

It’s not a matter of personal freedoms or choice-you know the “government can’t make me” crowd of Gadsden flag wavers. 
It’s about protecting society in general-your neighbors, their families, that restaurant server or car mechanic. 

Years ago a perso who spread HIV/AIDS could be incarcerated for spreading that infection. 
And no, I am not advocating such treatment for today’s anti-vaccer crowd.

Because though I live in a state with a high vaccination rate, to deal with family matters, I just returned from travel to south Georgia; had a layover in the Nashville airport where IF there was any kind of mask mandate, it was extremely lax; and was on a plane that was loaded with people who'd been visiting Fort Lauderdale, FL.  In GA, I'd estimate that no more than 1-2% of people wore masks in stores.  Personally, I double-masked every time I was in public and for the duration of my 4 flights, layovers, and shuttle trips.  Also, what is it with almost exclusively men who cannot be bothered to cover their noses even when they do mask up???  Yes, anger is the word.  And resentment.

Make him and his family pay for it all.  
A second idea is to have insurance companies drop customers who refuse to get vaccinated.  Unvaccinated people cost money because they are more likely than vaccinated people to get sick from COVID-19.
Hitting people in the pocketbook is a tremendous incentive for them to do the right thing and get vaccinated."

Now we are again looking at mask mandates and travel restrictions - the things we had been ecstatic to leave behind - because of people who think that the vaccine implants microchips, isn't sufficiently proven to be effective, impairs fertility or is simply a personal prerogative.

Society should have to wait for her and those others?  
Where?

2021-07-27 12:15:25,I gather that the majority of the anti-vaccine crowd are conservative. Look back through history and see what other stances that conservatives have taken (most recently damage to the climate) and tell me: Why would they be right this time?
2021-07-27 12:15:59,"One area where I agree with conservatives is in using free market methods. No laws other than the natural principles of equilibrium are needed. NO vaccination, NO taxpayer funded anything. You can choose, no one is forcing your hand. You can buy private medical insurance or move to a different place like the UK where they have NHS. Just don’t expect US taxpayers to pick up the pieces. A very few legitimate exceptions might be warranted but no loopholes. This is the conservative position on birth control and abortion, (two areas where I don’t agree with their position) so it should be the same for covid. The equivalent of abstinence is isolating, wearing a mask and getting vaccinated."
2021-07-27 12:16:00,"I feel it. I am about to eat $1,000 I had already invested into a music festival in the fall and some of the people I am going with are not vaccinated. It will be impossible to keep social distance measures in place and have a mask mandate at this type of event. I knew I should have went with my gut initially and passed. I am getting comments like...""My fear for people like you is you won't live your life and you will live in fear for the rest of your life""...spoken like a true 30 year old, LOL. I was going with my kids and a friend of theirs. The fact is, I have to take care of my mother and step dad who has dementia and I have too many obligations to play Covid Roulette."

About war. About social equality. Where is the anger about that? Why is it ok to spread misinformation without consequence in the name of ""free speech""? Those that are the root cause of spreading misinformation are laughing all the way to leadership positions where they can further weaken American society. And the poor mules who believed them are left carrying the bag."
2021-07-27 12:16:34,"Those who feel they have the ""right"" to remain unvaccinated are operating under a truly misguided understanding of ""freedom."" An individual has no more right to intentionally expose their fellow citizens to a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease than they do to release toxins into the air or to defecate into the public drinking water. People do indeed have the right to remain willfully ignorant and to make poorly informed choices, but they do not have the right to inflict the consequences of their bad choices on the public health of their community."
2021-07-27 12:17:09,"If my loved one in a long term care facility got covid and that facility had permitted unvaccinated employees around that loved one, I would sue the facility and the unvaccinated individuals. Would it make up for the harm done or possible death? Absolutely not, but money or the fear of losing it seem to be the only things that get some peoples’ attention. It’s an absolute outrage that their “freedom” to reject a safe and effective vaccine permits them to inflict illness and possible death on the vulnerable. What about everyone else’s right to life and freedoms?  President Macron got it right in requiring the unvaccinated to have limited recourse to public spaces until they get vaccinated."
2021-07-27 12:17:58,"Employer mandates are the next best solution. Boycotts of companies that don’t require employee vaccination are the next step.  After all, don’t Republicans praise the free market over government intervention?"
2021-07-27 12:18:30,"It’s not going to come from the federal government, because Biden is worried about the 2022 midterms and fears it would give Republicans government overreach and infringement ammunition.

Politics over lives.

In fact, President Biden missed a critical opportunity some weeks and months ago when, knowing of the threat of the delta variant, he could have at least been more vocal in persuading universities and businesses and organizations to require vaccination. But he was reluctant to, instead just pleading with people to get vaccinated.

Again, politics over lives."
2021-07-27 12:18:33,"It starts with the White House and Pres Biden.  He should issue an executive order mandating all federal workers must be vaccinated.  He should also mandate all federal contractors be vaccinated.  If they can issue orders mandating minimum wages for contractors or gender non discrimination, then they can do this.  

With the Federal government taking the lead, it will ease the path for state and local governments and businesses.  

If I were in charge, I would tie all stimulus money to states, schools, etc to mandating vaccinations."
2021-07-27 12:18:44,Thanks for this article.  Count me among the angry.  Agree that insurance shouldn’t cover those who don’t get vaccinated.  Its sad because we could have reached herd immunity.   Definitely must be federal mandates for all health workers and public servants.

2021-07-27 12:19:04,"Nosocomial infections (those arising from being infected in healthcare settings) are enormous no-nos by the Joint Commission and CMS. Legal and financial liability goes a long way in persuading healthcare organizations to mandate vaccinations of their employees and professionals with treating privileges.

The US has a long history of containing and eliminating communicable diseases when public health experts were charged with this. Mandating home confinement for adults who willfully refuse vaccinations and appropriate public measures including masking and distancing should be instituted. If people refuse to act in a civil and safe manner, then remove them from civil society.

Enough of pandering to disease vectors and those who court their support."
2021-07-27 12:19:05,"I am coming to a belief the issue is psychological, and must be addressed as such.  The vaccine holdouts acknowledge the risks of contracting the virus, but for some reason discount those in comparison to much vaguer worries about vaccine side effects. 

The difference seems to be responsibility.  If I participate in accepting a vaccine, I am accepting responsibility for those vague worries.   Somehow, inexplicably, these folks prefer the random chance model of “maybe I won’t be exposed” to taking on responsibility to increase their odds of avoidance.  I don’t suggest to understand this…can we get a few psychologists on this?"

When even Kaye Ivey blames the unvaccinated in her state, Alabama, where they have the lowest rate of vaccinations and one of, if not the highest, rate of recent Delta infections, you have to wonder just how much lemming-like people can be.

I strongly suspect that in communities of People of Color, the mis-information is deliberate, insidious, and is being disseminated by far-right racist groups.  I have no evidence of this...but it fits tightly with every other attempt to prevent those very same people in those communities from voting.

Yesterday, I went to a business that  3 weeks ago was OK with vaccinated people not wearing masks.  Yesterday, they wisely demanded everyone masked, despite the staff being 100% vaccinated.

If I were Mr. Perldeiner I would have NEVER allowed an anti-vaxxer near MY child, no matter how close she was.  In Law, there's a principle that reckless endangerment IS a crime, and one doesn't have to deliberately endanger someone to be accountable.  Perldeiner's relative SHOULD be charged with reckless endangerment of his 2 year old.

I have zero sympathy for the unvaccinated, and do not believe they have ANY right to expose others (and so many claim to be ""pro-Life"" while they infect others!)"

2021-07-27 12:21:09,"I am fully vaccinated (and was early on) but understand why some are very reluctant to get vaccinated.  The problem is messaging and planning.   First, the mask mandate was lifted too early.  There were never benchmarks set for lifting it.    It should have been something like, ""when x percentage of the state or country or whatever is fully vaccinated, then the mandate will be lifted.""  It seemed so random to lift...a few days prior to this, Dr. Fauci said people would be wearing masks for many months to come.  Moreover, the incentives were insane.  Get a vaccine and we will give you a free donut or free fried or a free lottery ticket or free marijuana.  Really?  Also, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine has been problematic and doesn't seem very appealing.  Finally, the amount of information and disinformation is dizzying.   The CDC has done an atrocious job of communication as have multiple politicians.  To increase the vaccine rate, it's time to look at this and fix this."
2021-07-27 12:21:30,"Good ideas in practice are hard to implement - withholding stimulus payments or tax credits from vaccine refusers - why do people only realize what they should have done when it's too late.

Medicare and Medicaid coverage should require a person be vaccinated unless there is a medical reason for them not to be vaccinated."
2021-07-27 12:22:04,"We can’t leave our own heads, but most of us accept that there is a common reality outside of them, seek consensus on how it works, and cooperate in applying that knowledge. In a nutshell, this is scientific thinking. Some of us believe that true knowledge only arrives by personal epiphany, and have no trust that the universe makes sense, allowing for supernatural phenomena of many types. Most of these people consider themselves religious. There is literally no point in trying to convince such people with a logical train of thought. If public safety is at issue, they must be coerced or segregated. This is their choice, as they refuse to admit that such a thing as public good even exists, or that it is more important than their own desires. 

None of them are Christians, if that point matters. Pastors, etc. could help by pointing this out to their congregations, flatly stating that this is a Christian church and the selfishness of vaccination refusal runs counter to what is taught and discussed here. Then the cultural warriors can start their own Jedi churches, and may the Delta Force be with them."

Being out and about, seeing smiles instead of masks, sharing hugs with friends and just generally not thinking about covid. Sometimes I’ll go days in between needing to put a mask on to go into a store. 

Now, once again, the most ignorant elements of our society threaten to bring us all down. In service to what—adulation of a cult leader who has empowered them to “stand up” for some unspecified “rights”? The sick gratification of “sticking it to the libs”? I truly do not understand the mindset of those who follow this twisted logic, and have no sympathy for their self-inflicted plights. Enough already."
2021-07-27 12:23:50,"A couple of observations.

1) People who are holding back are counting on the vaccine being available if and when they finally decide to take the shot. An announcement that areas where vaccination rates have stalled would have their vaccine supplies sent elsewhere, perhaps to countries desperate for supplies, might make some decide to get the shot while they can. Those who still won’t probably won’t be persuaded by anything.

2) There are many reasons why people are holding off, but the elephant in the room is the decades of distrust conservatives and their media have instilled in their base. They have demonized government, rejected science, and promoted conspiracy theories for political and financial gain. They have made liberals the scapegoat to be blamed for everything bad in the country. 

They have deliberately made their base angry and paranoid. They are post-policy at this point - they have nothing else to offer.

It’s not just the pandemic they are blocking action on. Climate, social justice, inequality - they block action on anything that threatens their donor class and their grip on their base. The party of “free-dumb” has wrapped their followers in chains made of lies and disinformation, fear and hate.

The pandemic has done this much good. It has made clear how the GOP has become a cult. Vaccine refusal, January 6 - two sides of the same coin.

They are the real threat we must meet."

That’s why those of us who are vaccinated are angry."
2021-07-27 12:25:24,"Carol Meyer suggests that there is a social contract being broken in the U.S., I would suggest that the #1 disfunction in the U.S. is the complete lack of a social contract between the U.S. goverment and its citizenry. Hoping for a social contract between such a diverse range of people, as exists in the U.S.A. without govermental involvement, is folly on a huge scale. The resulting patchwork of social nets for people (and states, who don't really have a social contract with the federal goverment for consistent and fair assistance with basic needs either) is anything but a meaningful social contract. I am sure many Americans like the idea of a social contract, but many more can't distinguish between socialism and, well.....anything else really."
2021-07-27 12:25:49,"""...Questions have arisen over the potential costs people may face if they become severely ill and need treatment. To address concerns over costs associated with COVID-19, Vice President Pence met with a group of large private insurers, who agreed to waive copayments and deductibles for COVID-19 tests. However, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) clarified that the out-of-pocket costs for treatment – such as hospitalizations for more serious cases – would not be waived, meaning people with private insurance who face deductibles could be on the hook for large costs. ""

So since the hesitant are not afraid of covid enough to get a vaccine they should be educated about the financial damage potentially coming their way.  Merican's understand $$$ if nothing else.  Also, no financial relief should be offered to them in the future if you refused the vaccine.

I remember early on, reading about the Spanish flu and the foolish decisions people made, like attending parades, and thought, ""Well, we learned our lesson from that. That will never happen again.""

He's not responsible for all the unvaccinated.  Just many.  From the days and months of him calling this a Democratic Hoax or a ""nothing"" or ""It's like a bad cold.  One day there's like 15 cases and the next it's like zero"",  he has had blood on his hands.   And bleach.

I followed all the scientific guidance and a lot of the time that was inconvenient. Welcome to the real world. I celebrated when a vaccine was discovered because it seemed that the nightmare would finally end, and I got vaccinated as soon as I could, both for my own and for society's wellbeing.  Are the vaccines 100% foolproof? Nothing in this life is. But the odds are against anyone who doesn't get vaccinated. The hospitals and cemeteries are full of them. The anti-vaxers keep talking about their freedom. But when their freedom keeps the rest of us hostage to their ignorance and inaction, it's no longer freedom, it's tyranny. We won't be held hostage forever. We've heard all our lives that actions have consequences.These people need to get the vaccine or face the consequences, their choice.

Canada is opening the border to fully-vaxxed Americans in early August, and yet we have close anti-vax Republican relatives who are urging us to come visit them  in the US instead of vice-versa. We have to wonder about the hypocrisy of it all: that we should be asked to pay for COVID tests, possible quarantine of our children, and most importantly, risking our children's safety by leaving our bubble, so that the ""freedom"" of these relatives is upheld. It's been well over a year now since they have seen our kids.

""She suggested health insurers link coverage of hospital bills to immunization. 'If you choose not to be part of the solution, then you should be accountable for the consequences,' she said.""  I could not agree more. 

Of course, let's put the blame where it lies, and that's with our irresponsible leaders, starting with Trump, who started all of this.  What would happen if he stopped whining about his election loss, and opened his mouth to do something useful for a change.  and urge people to get vaccinated, as he has had done for himself.  Then maybe his ReTrumplican sycophants would follow in lockstep once again.

Of course, there are still smokers standing 10 feet from the  entrance in freezing weather to ""enjoy"" that cigarette with  the death warning on the pack"
2021-07-27 12:35:34,"After being vaccinated in the spring, then enjoying a time of relative normality, I am going back into quarantine again out of fear of the spread. I am angry and fearful again. I’ve made my last grocery/library/fitness-center/store trips and am receding back into lockdown. I have the feeling others are, too. And we are ANGRY. I am terribly worried about elderly relatives and about young children - both worry me now constantly. We should not be here, and I am ANGRY and in LOCKDOWN again."
2021-07-27 12:35:34,"Amongst friends, I often use the bans on smoking as an example of how others must give up ""their"" individual freedoms in public settings so as not to cause harm to others.  It is no longer just bars, restaurants, and planes which do not allow smoking, it is also public open air parks, city streets, as well as many other outdoor settings.  Unlike the smoke leaving the lips of the smoker, we are unable to see the aerosolized covid droplets flying from the mouths of the infected anti-vaxers, and thus are unable to distance and protect ourselves from the air they contaminated.  This is how these types get away with causing us harm.  There is no way to see who is causing the harm, therefore there is now way to hold them to account for intentionally placing others at risk and causing the harm.  

It was not until the Federal Government threatened to withhold highway funds, that the last few hold out states came in line and raised the drinking age to 21.  Withholding Federal money and grants is how Biden & Co. can initiate and enforce a vaccine card requirement.  Will there be a backlash?  Of course there will be backlash.  Just as there were backlashes on all the previous government regulations which were for the greater good... no smoking ordinances... seatbelt laws...speed limits...TSA airport screening.... Eventually, people come into compliance, and what in the beginning caused backlash, over time becomes commonplace."

2021-07-27 12:36:12,"Yet another example of everyone being reduced to the lowest possible denominator: in this case those too stubborn, ignorant, or stupid to get the vaccine.  All the rest of us suffer.  We have enough unvaccinated, and likely will continue to be in that situation short of mandates, to curb the virus’ spread.  That allows it to mutate, hence Delta and whatever the next, even more virulent strain develops.  
Since this is basically a political divide, with Trump, the 900 pound gorilla at the center, the “blue” state should implement some sort of vaccine “passport” that will allow the vaccinated into public gatherings and bar those who are not.  Any public employees in those regions should be required to get vaccinated.  Anyone traveling to one of those “blue” states from an area not vaccinated should have to quarantine and get tested before being allowed into the community, no exceptions.  To facilitate this, Biden should identify the regions that have vaccination rates that are too low to travel to “blue” states.  Beyond all this, those who are vaccinated should refuse to interact with those who have chosen not to get vaccinated.  They should boycott businesses that do not require their employees to get vaccinated.  Money talks."
2021-07-27 12:37:02,"Hilary Clinton ran for president and won the popular vote.  When she had to concede due to losing the Electoral College, no one seemed to care about placating the 51% or more who voted for her.  The news stories headlines were not about what her voters wanted or how to stay focused on them after the election.

Donald Trump loses the election soundly---by a significant margin in both the Electoral and the popular vote---and the news and government are more concerned about placating the views of his losers than the victors. 

What is the difference here?  Trump's followers and anti-vaxxers are mostly white and male?  Republican?

I guess it does not really matter if President Biden will not develop the backbone of earlier presidents who managed during health pandemics.  We did not make whooping cough, polio, chicken pox, smallpox, and many other essential vaccines optional for use of public schools and other government facilities.  People understood or allowed themselves to be subject to common sense rules.  The government's job is to protect the lives of its citizens.  Mandate the vaccine and get on with it."

He and other Republican governors are actually fighting against vaccination by preventing mandates. So much for platitudes about getting government out of the decisions of private businesses. Yes, I am angry.

Vaccination rates in Florida are highly overstated. What's happening is that planeloads of South Americans (with tourist visas granted before the pandemic) arrive in Florida every day, partly for vacation but mainly to get vaccinated. These people are artificially inflating Florida's statistics."

There is way too much talk about the human cost that the anti-vaxxer Republican liars are inflicting on America.  It has no effect.  Well, there is a financial cost to those ignorant people who do not get vaccinated when they get sick.

The public is picking up the financial cost of these parasites who demand their freedom from protecting society.  Whether it is through insurance premiums, Medicare, Medicaid or any number of charities, these parasites are taking money away from the vaccinated.

I demand my freedom to not pay for the ignorant unvaccinated.  They must pay their medical costs.  Stop the freeloading parasites now.  Enable third party payers to demand $100K deductibles for unvaccinated who receive medical attention."

Show people what's going on in overrun hospitals. Show very sick, unvaxxed virus patients. Things like this, broadcast over and over again, and a simplified version of the vaccine science explained over and over again. Until folks have no excuse for not knowing it."

One unvaccinated person I work with just come back from a trip to Columbia, another just visited her sister in Florida and still another came back from a family reunion. This vaccine hesitation goes across all education levels. One of my family members is a doctor but she isn’t getting the vaccine because her lawyer husband ‘s practice is based on lawsuits of vaccine companies who have “damaged” his clients via vaccination.

That means mandatory mask requirements for unvaccinated people who wish to do things like,boarding planes, attending face-to-face meetings, going shopping, etc. I don't care if the masks identify the unvaccinated. It's their decision to be unvaccinated and they should own it. I'm tired of navigating around people who are allowed to do as they wish while the damage of THEIR decisions keeps piling up on the shoulders of everyone else. I'm tired of suffering collateral damage due to the unwillingness of leaders at all levels to put the hammer down and enforce/implement unpopular policies that would increase public health. This statement applies to the assorted nonsense occurring pre-pandemic ( i.e., lawlessness, homeless encampments on public streets, rioting, property destruction).

If you have one, great you can go to the movies, restaurants or gym.  If you don't have one, you don't get to do any of those activities (I suppose the unvaccinated can still order take out).  I briefly enjoyed my time at the gym unmasked but now feel as though I have to wear one even though I am vaccinated. 
 Also, the time for Mask mandates to come back is now, not later. For essentials such as food shopping and other activities we can't keep anti-maskers from, time to bring back masks.

He then magnamimously announces that he cares about people, he respects their different opinion and right to do whatever makes them feel safe. He ends by stating that if you are worried about covid, to get the vaccine, wear a mask, and stay out of risky areas. And he asks so how are they harmed by me?
Sigh...I am baffled at his attitude and that he printed his name and address. While I do not care for cancel culture, perhaps there are exceptions. I would be pleased to see crowds with signs peacefully demonstrating in his upscale neighborhood. Flame his websites. Refuse his business. Make him a pariah.

This is because America is an incredibly cloistered and insular country. The ongoing and still very much present COVID-19 pandemic will NOT be over until it's over EVERYWHERE. America's hoarding of vaccines, absurd refusal of 50% of their people to get vaccinated, and irrational refusal to wear masks or practice social distancing will help demonstrate this.

In fact, I think we are not far off from an Epsilon variant, first discovered in the US. You've created a perfect Petri dish for a vaccine resistant strain and since you insist on traveling all over the place in the midst of a still raging and growing global pandemic (Americans in Greece, Italy, France, etc. is patently insane) will ensure it gets spread everywhere.

It felt odd at first but then felt normal to me. 

Yet, given the exponential growth of the Delta variant, the rise in cases here in Mass., and having read this very article this morning, I again donned the mask this morning when I went to the market and CVS. I also noticed more people wearing masks as compared to this time last week.

There is no reason to take any chances. We also turned down a wedding invitation for late Aug. due to the prevalence of the variant and the uncertainty as to whether or not a given person was vaccinated.

When I was growing up, freedom was always explained in terms its attendant obligations, making freedom and responsibility inseparable concepts. Freedom with responsibility was the catch phrase.

While I respect people’s right to make these personal choices, what the holdouts really want is to not be forced to get the vaccine AND not be excluded from public transportation or schools or cruise lines or to have to do anything different as a result of their personal choice. They want freedom with NO responsibility. 

That is not freedom! That is simply selfishness making the rest of us bend and be inconvenienced so they can make a bad choice and the rest of us pay for it. If you choose not to be vaccinated you shouldn’t inconvenience the rest of us by flying on an airplane and force the rest of us to wear masks in venues where only the vaccinated should be allowed.

I also agree with one healthcare interviewee who said insurers should refuse to pay for hospitalizations where vaccination is refused by those who can get it.

Are you listening conservatives: insuring anti vaccinators is spreading the cost of individual bad choices to the rest of us, essentially socializing the cost of a bad personal choice. That smacks of SOCIALISM! Are you conservatives on board with this?"

The irony of this is that most are pro-life. I actually had an unvaccinated patient say to me last week, ""My body, my choice"".

The government is driven and controlled by the GOP in Washington, DC.
The current Alabama political leadership simply refuses to do anything, whatsoever, to protect citizens, including minor children, from the Covid-19 by mandating masks and vaccinations. 
The only statement you will  hear out of the current Republican Party of Alabama is that ""Alabama is open for business."" Translated:  the Republicans Party of Alabama will sacrifice the health and lives of workers to ensure that businesses remain.
It is beyond making me angry. I want these people to be charged with crimes against humanity for their deliberate, gross, negligence that has, thus far, cost the lives of thousands of Alabama citizens.
Until these Republican Party office holders in state governments are held accountable for their crimes against humanity they will stop at nothing to ensure that their donor's objectives are met.
Biden is doing nothing to keep control of policy, he is against the filibuster and allowing the Republican unvaccinated to control public policy concerning mandatory masking and vaccinations. I have zero respect for Biden and Democratic leaders in both houses of Congress who have failed to use their votes to better our lives. None."

2021-07-27 12:54:14,"There’s no point and there’s real harm in blaming, shaming or persecuting people for not getting vaccinated.
You can’t give up on people, keep educating and advocating.

If you want to blame anyone, start with former Pres. Trump. Had he posted a single photo of himself being vaccinated back in January, he would have saved lives and changed the entire dynamic.

That Trump was not even capable of doing that singular act of basic leadership shows plainly that the man was unfit for any office and simply does not care about his own supporters, much less America.

Then you can work your way down the list of elected and religious leaders and media voices who have so irresponsibly used their positions, pulpits and media megaphones to sow ignorance and distrust in public health.

Finally, you can blame Facebook and other social media platform players who act like adolescents and say “Don’t blame me!” Instead of just acting to remove the misinformation wherever it has come from, and taking a moral and responsible position to protect public health."
2021-07-27 12:54:28,"In a global pandemic, media outlets that blast out conspiracy theories and ramp up distrust of health authorities should be penalized. FCC, where are you? Fox MUST be held responsible for its society-destroying behavior."

We have been dancing around this for some time. We just need to understand them. We need to have empathy. 

Nope. No more. There are consequences not only to their vile behavior but also on their decision not to participate in civic, and civil, life. 

No admittance to any federal facility without proof of vaccination. No post office, no VA. Nothing.  If they refuse vaccines and work for the federal government, immediate termination. 

On the private enterprise side, no admittance to any sports venue or concert or whatever without mask or proof of vaccination. Saw with their employees. And any such facility receiving even a dime of federal money that doesn’t enforce this policy gets all federal money terminated. 

And so on. Maybe not legal, but it is a place to start. 

Oh, and one more thing.  A federal declaration that since wearing and requiring a vaccine is considered oppression in some states, in those all abortions are now legal.  To disallow masks and allow the unvaccinated to walk among us, disallowing abortion is hypocritical and downright vile."
2021-07-27 12:55:25,Hesitant about getting vaccinated? Fine. Then this attitude should be countered by a ‘hesitancy’ to distribute social services to that person. Give him/her a month without food stamps or other financial supplements and see if that helps. The “carrot” approach is failing.

2021-07-27 12:55:37,"When Black people lagged behind to take vaccination Biden and liberal media did not contempt them, did not ridicule them, they provided help, education and encouragement. They are doing the opposite now, assuming that whites and Republicans are the one lagging behind to take vaccination, though that is not entirely true. So, it is the result of a bad leadership approach that Biden did not reach his goal of 70% vaccination by July 4. Eventually people will take vaccine when they feel that it is better to take it. But, Biden's approach is counter productive."
2021-07-27 12:55:55,"Contained within the decision to not get vaccinated is the decision to put the life of others at risk of serious illness and/or death.  The notion that 'society will just have to wait for us' - the unvaccinated that have no fact or health-based reason for avoiding vaccination is so beyond selfish, it boggles the mind.  When the unvaxed say they are doing 'research' it typically means they're reading opinions or conspiracy theories on Facebook.  If we have to wait for Facebook to clean up their mess so these 'just have to wait for us' people can be persuaded...we'll be waiting a long, long time.  

Employers can require vaccinations for employees in the workplace and they should do so to protect other employees and customers.  

The fact is, red states are less vaccinated than blue states and vaccinations have been politicized, leading trump supporters into a nihilistic trap where they can harm others on their way down.  Constituents dying to 'own the libs'  is the predictable outcome of a failed coup and a failed gop."

Why should insurance companies be obligated to pick up the tab for anti-vaxxers who get sick and need to be hospitalized? There are consequences for making choices, and  anti-vaxxers should face the consequences of their poor decisions."
2021-07-27 12:57:28,"I was vaccinated early, to protect myself and others. I don't like wearing a mask, but I still do. I might still get a little sick, but my medical expenses will be paid for by insurance.

I object, however, having to support, with insurance premiums and taxes, treating COVID libertarians who refuse vaccination and catch the disease.  Why has no one proposed denying them insurance and subsidies when they show up in ECUs?  Natural immunity would be their rightful choice.  They can choose to survive by chance, while the rest of us do so by design."

Skeptics need to be convinced by people they trust, like Ms. Denton was by her doctor. My son works for a needle exchange in Waterbury, Conn. He was able to convince three homeless men recently to get vaccinated. He bought them food and just listened to what they had to say. It’s in these intimate interactions where the fight will be won, not in browbeating the misinformed."
2021-07-27 12:59:08,"I’m sorry, but someone’s personal freedom to not get the vaccine ends the second they could affect the life and well being of another person who is unable to get the vaccine.   Stop being so ignorant, so selfish, and just get the vaccine!"
2021-07-27 12:59:22,"It’s simple. At this point, insurance companies should refuse to pay the hospital bills for any of the unvaccinated if they catch covid.

Natural Selection."
2021-07-27 12:59:27,"I am infectious diseases physician. I am FED UP with the ""freedom"" rant from the resistors. What about the freedom of OTHERS to be free from risk of serious illness of death because of misguided ranters who refuse vaccination? They have MORE to lose because they have no choice here. 

I've said it before: we, as physicians, took an oath to care for the sick. But we did not agree to care for those who, because of their mindless belief in illogical and false propaganda, put their own, their families', their communities' and the healthcare workers' lives at risk. 

If they decide to forego vaccination, they should forego healthcare when they become ill. After all, we in the healthcare community are, apparently, part of the problem."

Not only are the unvaccinated at risk, they are increasing the risk for all. Time to put some mitigation strategies in place. When you have several accidents your car insurance goes up, if you smoke your health insurance goes up, if you are not cooperative with co-workers you can lose your job. etc.
The solution here is easy and we better get to it sooner than later."
2021-07-27 13:01:17,"The delay in approval of the vaccines by the FDA has also played an important  role in people questioning the safety of the vaccines.

A quick GOOGLE search confirms what we all know. Then, she became angry with ME when I printed the article for her. Dumb. Self-important. Lonely. Inconsiderate. This is the state of affairs in our country.

State and Federal government have the tools to compel mandatory vaccines. Remove some social safety nets like unemployment benefits. Consumer facing business like grocery stores, retail etc. should not be available for the unvaccinated. Cut their cable TV access. Revoke a gym membership. Turn off their electricity. Prevent their kids from enrolling in school.

If you are not vaccinated, you should not enjoy an open society."
2021-07-27 13:02:01,"As someone who takes civic responsibility seriously and has been vaccinated, don't tell me I shouldn't be angry at those who refuse vaccinations. I trust science over politicians who have inflamed this divide. Not getting vaccinated is the same as drunk driving in my opinion, you are putting others at risk due to your reckless actions. 

If you are worried about long term consequences, consider the delta variant.. It arrived partly because many refused to mask up and allowed the virus to become more widespread. 

My concern is the next variant that will be worse and we are all back to square one.

If I were an insurance company I would require a vaccine in order to get coverage. Or at a minimum pay a higher rate because of the higher risk. Right now we all pay for the additional costs associated with those who refuse to vaccinate.

Yes, we vaccinated have a right and good reasons to be angry with the unvaccinated."
2021-07-27 13:02:51,"Anger at the people who are anti-vaccination is not a new feeling for me. I realized early on, when President Trump continually played his base like a fiddle, that there would be a huge group not participating and that we had little chance of reaching herd immunity. If our country can't do it what hope is there for those not positioned as well. It is upsetting, frustrating, and anger inducing. I have a daughter and son-in-law who are physicians and are on the front lines. They have treated so many people who did not need to be ill. My husband and I have friends who lost a daughter. This is real and has been turned into a worst case scenario by these misled people."

2021-07-27 13:07:42,"We're all worried about a resurgent Delta variant, the return of lockdowns, and our personal safety. But how many of us have been diligent about getting flu shots in years past? Or even this past year? Were we shamed for our decision? Did we lose insurance coverage for it? No, even though the flu kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. 

The hesitant folks I know here are mistrustful of doctors and the medical establishment, usually because of negative personal experience. Many of them have ended up getting the shot, but they really needed to see for themselves that it was safe and effective and that there would be no surprise billing for it (except, incredibly, there is still surprise billing for it).

The FDA needs to declare Covid vaccines to be safe and not 'experimental'. If someone in 2019 asked you to take an ""experimental mRNA vaccine,"" would you have done it? It's not crazy for people to be leery of what sounds to the layperson like ""Untested Gene-Altering Substance Shot"". 

Our government & the medical establishment really need to step up its messaging about the vaccine -- and about public health generally -- and do so with humility. These organizations need to recognize how deep the (justifiable) mistrust has gotten and do some repair work. I like my doctor and my local clinic, and I got vaccinated with enthusiasm, but they're the same people who sent me a $1,900 bill 'by accident' two years ago."

2021-07-27 13:08:13,"The antivax sentiment is not only irritating - it can kill vulnerable people. Yes, having to get a shot, wear a mask, social distance and endure lockdowns has been stressful, frustrating and really (at best) inconvenient, but we are living through a global pandemic and have to do some uncomfortable things. I understand it is unnerving to take a new vaccine but it is saving a lot of lives. My husband is a surgeon at a NYC hospital that was slammed with COVID-19 last spring -- he cared for many patients in the COVID ICU and despite his best efforts, many didn't survive. We never want to experience a time like that ever again and welcomed our jabs this winter. I think people need to start caring about each other at least a little bit more and make an effort for the collective good."

It is high time we leave those people to their own devices. If they happen to dodge Covid, great. If not, well, let's just say I will not be shedding a tear for them. Rather than investing so much time, energy, and money  in ""horses who refuse to drink from the well"", let's invest it into research that focuses on those of us who did our moral and civic duty by getting vaccinated can be kept safe from refuseniks. The Biden administration should provide funds to virologists and other such experts to investigate whether booster shots will be needed to protect us against any and all variants of Covid-19, as well as how the nation can be protected against future pandemics. Enough already with caring about those who show little or no understanding, let alone compassion, for their fellow Americans!"
2021-07-27 13:08:25,"I’m vaccinated. I don’t think vaccinations should be mandated. I believe liberty is important and that we should protect our freedom, even at the cost of death. However, this was a much easier ideal to believe in when we had a 90-95 percent vaccination rate against things like measles, smallpox, and polio. What I find incredibly troubling is the amount of misinformation that has been proliferated for political and financial gain about vaccines. I have good friends who are smart but when they seek to inform themselves are faced with confusing messages from ubiquitous biased sources. And even the sources we are supposed to be able to trust like the CDC and WHO have put out conflicting messages. I’ve worked in healthcare for decades and specialize in critically appraising information. Since COVID, I’ve wondered how the average person could possibly inform themselves well. That is what should be regulated. Those politicians, government organizations, and media outlets disseminating misinformation should be ashamed of themselves and they should be forced to stop. We need a broad sweeping pubic service campaign that properly maligns yellow journalism and puts it squarely back into the category of obvious and thoroughly mocked."

My husband and I received our vaccines in February.  We still wear our masks, and still feel hesitant to leave the house.
What if we run into the virus and pass it to someone?  We may be safe, but is the person we pass by?  Would we be passing it to a child?
We waited at home this last year.  We never left the house.  Our food was delivered, we saw no one.  Holidays were via phone calls and computer visits.  We've given up over a year of our lives to help make it safe for others.  And at our ages, we just don't have that many left.

It’s imperative believe that the individual choice is important and greatly respected when it comes to collective decision making. The world will never act as a whole unit, and if the sick and vulnerable have every access and right to the vaccine (and they do in most of America) then what is the fear for? If the individuals who choose not to vaccinate themselves somehow find themselves sick, why are we afraid for those who are vaccinated? What’s the mission here? To make people feel threatened into action? Shamed into action? Has that ever effectively worked in mankind’s history? Takeaway is this: be kind to one another. If you can and want the vaccine, get it, the world should return to normal. There is no more any vulnerable left because they themselves all have access to that protection. Let it be. Let’s not confuse ourselves, the only ones in control of lockdowns and mandates are the government and the government alone, no amount of action taken will change their course."
2021-07-27 13:15:40,"I have read repeatedly over the past year and a half of many individuals, as they lay in a hospital bed severely ill, who suddenly wished they had taken Covid more seriously. Interestingly, I've not heard of a single case of someone regretting wearing a mask and getting vaccinated. I like to think I learn from others mistakes as well as my own..."
2021-07-27 13:15:51,"What about people who have already had a bout of Covid? Does it make sense to force them to undergo vaccination? Their immune systems are already primed and they will likely have a very unpleasant reaction to the vaccine. Are you positive that the vaccine will actually help them? If so, what evidence do you have?"
2021-07-27 13:16:04,"Many of the vaccine holdouts worry about the long term effects of the vaccine, but not about the long term effects of being infected with the coronavirus.  In their minds they have minimized the damage the virus can do, in spite of thorough documentation of its devastation, while speculating on the possible long term effects of a vaccine which has been administered for over half a year.  This dissonance is a direct result of Trump/Republicans minimizing the damage of the virus, and now exploiting the vaccine as the latest threat to their 'freedoms.'  When we have reached the point where many people would rather take their chances with a virus that can multiply exponentially inside their bodies than take a non-replicating fragment of the virus that simply tricks the immune system into making antibodies, we have attained psychosis on a society wide scale."

2021-07-27 13:16:12,A coworker of mine said he wasn’t getting the vaccine because “it will make it easier for him to spread Covid” if he was vaccinated.
2021-07-27 13:16:48,"Nothing in this story about non-stop bombardment from Fox News  and Republicans officials etc supporting anti-vaxxers. For example, Florida has made it against the law to require proof of vaccination; Republican congresspeople like Johnson and Taylor-Greene constantly undermine pubic health messaging."
2021-07-27 13:16:49,"There was an article in the Times recently blaming misinformation for he vaccine reluctance, and that surely has had some hand. It's also hard to forget though that both Biden and Harris expressed reluctance at the ""Trump"" vaccine while campaigning. Since many of the holdouts remain in Democratic leaning minority communities, it is hard to blame only Trump and crew. The poor handling of the vaccination effort has crossed party lines. Perhaps, instead of reluctance towards ""Operation Warp Speed"" while campaigning, the current folks should have thought more about America's long-term health than being elected. I'm glad I got the ""Trump"" vaccine as soon as lawfully available to me."
2021-07-27 13:17:06,It makes perfect sense that those who go intentionally unvaccinated be refused medical treatment. Their reckless choice endangers all. Let them die.
2021-07-27 13:17:24,I don't understand why this is not mandated by the Federal Government. Most people wear their seatbelts. Most people will actually follow the law and get vaccinated. Those that don't should be penalized on their taxes.
2021-07-27 13:17:56,I do judge people like this individual that don't get vaccinated. They should be judged and their opinion is not as good as the actual facts of science. If they want to have the opinion drinking bleaches healthy they will touch them because that opinion is wrong. The same is true for people that don't want to get vaccinated.
2021-07-27 13:18:45,"I know of at least 5 non-vaccinated women who I work with.  They say they don't trust it.  They are all republican.  All Catholic.  

It makes me so mad that I can't bear to speak to them.  I fear I will say something I will regret.  

I will continue to wear my mask, as it is my civic duty, but how much longer should the vaccinated have to cover for those who are not?  

The anger mentioned in this article is real, and it's building."
2021-07-27 13:18:53,"This is not new.  When the government started mandating seat belts, there was a huge hue and cry about it.  And to this day people are getting seat belt tickets.  People don't like to be coerced, regardless of the benefit to them.

There is a perception that this is a political issue.  But that's not really the case.  For example, in Los Angeles, the black community has a relatively low vaccination rate even though they vote overwhelmingly Democratic.

Unfortunately it's a process that will just take time.  The FDA fully approving vaccines will help.  Younger children being ok'd for the vaccine will help.  Mandates will help.  But community immunity is unfortunately months away."
2021-07-27 13:18:59,"“The virus is here and it’s killing people, and we have a time-tested way to stop it — and we won’t do it. It’s an outrage.”  
    The virus is not responsible but our governments are responsible for this mass killing of people. There should have been a mandate long ago that all people need to be vaccinated except for medical reasons
 There should not be any religious exemption either, no religious scripture prohibits Covid vaccination or any other vaccine. Not getting the vaccine is equivalent to committing suicide, no religion would allow that.
   Covid is a public health issue, this is a global emergency. Covid vaccination is not a human rights issue. Covid should be treated just like tuberculosis or any other communicable disease.
  Governments can implement laws and punish people who are unwilling to get vaccinated, otherwise, they are failing in their responsibilities to the communities."
2021-07-27 13:19:41,"There are potentially many reasons why people haven’t been vaccinated. For example, if you have to walk a long distance or can’t afford to take time off from work, you’re going to rethink getting vaccinated, especially if you’re elderly or have a chronic disease. Right now, we don’t have enough data to understand completely why people aren’t getting vaccinated, and we need that data to make decisions on how to address the issue of the unvaccinated.

Republican politicians, keep shouting from the rooftops about the imperative of getting vaccinated. But you also need to take another virus seriously. The spread of extremism in your party is deadly — to our health and to our democracy. The 20 states with the highest vaccination rates (counting the District of Columbia as a state) all voted for President Biden. That’s no accident.

Spreading extremism is just one reason people avoid vaccines, but because their voices are amplified, the media loves to post their rants on front pages. In this issue, the media has been unfair. Before we decide on approving medications, we usually need a lot of data. The same should be true for those who are unvaccinated."
2021-07-27 13:19:56,"Consequences! No restaurants, bars, movies, sports, concerts for the unvaccinated. No air travel Mandatory masks for other indoor venues and schools. Stop fooling around with this."
2021-07-27 13:20:31,"The young woman who gave me my vaccine in early April was unvaccinated.   She said she was not getting it for religious reasons. 

I said to her, ""do you eat a certain type of food (I know is not mentioned in the bible) and she said ""Yes, I love it"".   I said that this vaccine is not mentioned in the bible either, nor his her car or Spotify player.

She just sat there perplexed.  I said, ""Get vaccinated""."
2021-07-27 13:20:35,"I’m so tired of hearing about someone’s “freedom” to refuse vaccination while putting the rest of us at risk. Why can’t we insist upon Covid vaccinations? We mandate vaccinations for children to attend school, university, summer camps and so on; we require seatbelts in cars and airplanes, also helmets on motorcycles  all i the name of public health and safety. Vaccinations should be required to attend school, travel, attend concerts and sporting events and to enter public spaces. Insurers should refuse to reimburse or pay for those who contract Covid if they have failed to be vaccinated (unless they have a clear medical reason). Why are we being held hostage and endangered because a group of people want to “wait until they feel safe” or because they don’t believe in science! It’s time to move forward. A social contract requires people to sometimes take actions they would prefer not to—if folks still refuse, they should be isolated and not allowed to engage fully in society. Natural consequences should follow their actions."
2021-07-27 13:20:51,"My family and  or those of us old enough  have been vaccinated , we have rights too.

2021-07-27 13:20:52,"There eventually will be a very malignant Covid variant which will resist all vaccine protections, a super virus if you will.  You then surely can blame the present “adults?” who chose now not to be vaccinated, but they are so contrarian, this would probably make many of them happy seeing our society squirm."

2021-07-27 13:21:30,"Call me a cold hearted so and so but I have no sympathy for anyone who is yet to get vaccinated and then gets sick with COVID-19. It’s our civic duty to roll up our sleeves, get the vaccine and return to some sense of normalcy. It’s the height of irresponsibility to hold out considering the risk the unvaccinated pose to young children. These people are irresponsible, negligent and down right dangerous."
2021-07-27 13:22:03,"If you tell society you don't want to be a member, you shouldn't be surprised when society says, OK, we don't want you either. Insurance companies should not cover people who refuse to get vaccinated and employers should make vaccination a condition of employment.  The few who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons can be accommodated."
2021-07-27 13:22:10,"Freedom is not free.    These people have a right not to be vaccinated but sadly the vaccination police are out in full force. 

 All that will be accomplished is to drive us further and further apart.      Do you really think that Covid is the only disease that can affect you or your associates?"
2021-07-27 13:22:13,"The only language Americans seem to understand is money so -no vaccine, no health insurance coverage; no vaccine but weekly testing required, you pay for testing; no vaccine in a public or health care job or maybe any job, you lose your job and you don’t get any government support. We mandated seat belts to ‘save lives’ but it was probably also motivated to save the insurance industry money. At the same time we require vaccination, we need to strengthen the vaccination proof so we don’t get cheaters claiming vaccination. Time to stop coddling anti-vaxxers without health reasons. My freedoms are just as important as theirs, and I’m not hurting anyone with my choice to be vaccinated, I’m helping them."
2021-07-27 13:22:16,"When I was a smoker I had to pay higher premiums for my health insurance.  It was my decision to smoke and it was my responsibility to pay for anything that may have happened to my health because of that.  It's called personal responsibility.  My actions are my own.  It's time to start charging higher insurance premiums for those who refuse the vaccine without a legitimate health reason, approved by a medical professional.  Don't want to get it because you need to prove a point or you're fanboying hard over some ""politician"" that doesn't know what he/she is talking about?  Fine.  It's your right to ""own the libs"" by potentially amassing high medical bills or taking the chance you won't be here to vote in the 2022 election.  More power to you and your decision.  But that's your choice, not mine...and it shouldn't be my responsibility to pay for it in my insurance premiums.  So it's time for personal responsibility and hands off my wallet."
2021-07-27 13:22:17,"The way you do it is require vaccination for nearly anything a person would want to do to enjoy life. So no eating at a restaurant without being vaccinated, no going to movies, shows, concerts or museums, no getting on a plane, no traveling into and out of the state and country, no going to college, no nothing except for the ability to go to the supermarket, drug store, doctor’s office, hospital and outdoors without either proof of vaccination or a medical waiver verifying that your doctor said it is not safe for you to be vaccinated, or a religious waiver in which you have to show proof you participated in the religion prior to March 2020."
2021-07-27 13:22:54,"Kids, as is too often the case, are getting the short end of the stick during this crisis. They don't have much agency to properly mask, properly distance, or to feel like those around them are doing those things to protect them. Now that the US has the most powerful tools on the planet with our vaccines, a third of the country is refusing them.

It should also be noted that there's a lot of overlap between people refusing vaccines/masks, and those conservative and/or religious types that scold America about how we're declining because of ""our wickedness"", or some other term of biblical doom.  Meanwhile, they're cooperating with a plague."
2021-07-27 13:22:54,"The anger reflected in comments below is sizzling and fully justified. I share it.

Bu may I offer a cautionary remark on the urge to refuse medical treatment and/or health insurance to the unvaccinated?

Should we then also refuse to treat or pay for people who get an STD because they refused to wear a condom? Someone hurt in an auto accident after driving drunk? A smoker who has lung cancer?

It would create a dangerous precedent to impose a moral test on people whose medical problems could have been prevented had they taken (or not taken) some action.

I fully support vaccine mandates, preferably universal and imposed by the feds. And social isolation for those who refuse. They should not be able to enjoy the social freedom they refuse to help protect. But if they get sick, they should receive medical care and their insurance should pay."
2021-07-27 13:22:58,"Education has not worked. Gentle persuasion has not worked. Even bribery (lottery tickets, free food) hasn't worked. It's time to simply exclude the unvaccinated from ALL public places, businesses, venues, transportation, and entertainment. These people have had [multiple] chances to get vaccinated but persistently refused, now the majority intends to protect themselves and their families."
2021-07-27 13:23:01,"Give them a deadline, that after that deadline tell them you will be refused treatment in any medical facility for anything, COVID or otherwise, because they are a threat to public health.

They are fortunate to live in a country where they can choose to go unvaccinated and die at home alone surrounded by whatever makes them happy."
2021-07-27 13:23:30,"France has an interesting perspective, especially now that it caught up with US's vaccination rate. President Macron's government chose to implement vaccine mandates for health and elderly care workers, and a health pass for the rest of the population for leisurely activities, restaurants, etc, with some exceptions. It has pros and cons of course. But the subtlety is that people are still free to choose not to get vaccinated; yet must face the consequences of their choice. People can get health passes without a vaccine, but to do so they must pay for PCR tests - no longer covered by the health care system - and get tested for each occasion. The sweeping effect is that in the week since, 5 million people jumped the vaccine bandwagon (~8% of the population!).

Sure enough there are protests (160'000 people across France demonstrated against the pass and for their so-called ""freedom"" last week-end according to Le Monde) but, at least my impression is, that these people have largely discredited themselves to the majority of the public, by using inappropriate comparisons to totalitarian or even the Nazi regimes for certain fringe movements. Also notable, it's an extremely diverse crowd, from far left to far right, to new-age idealists who only believe in ""natural"" care. The sentiment is that they are unlikely to agree on anything else or aggregate into a consistent political movement. How much of this is relevant to the US is really up in the air, but something to think about."
2021-07-27 13:23:59,"It's very frustrating, but vaccination shouldn't be mandated.  However, I want to see higher health care insurance rates for the non-vaccinated.  Health care coverage for those choosing to not get vaccinated shouldn't be subsidized by those who have been.  If you choose to live an unhealthy lifestyle, you pay more for life insurance and health insurance.  The same should occur with those shunning vaccinations."
2021-07-27 13:24:01,"I assume most unvaccinated adults trust the government that tells them that the heavily subsidized meat, dairy and eggs they buy are healthy to consume (NEWS FLASH: they’re not). No conspiracy there!"
2021-07-27 13:25:15,"As I stated last week in another comments section, choosing to be vaccinated or risking sickness and death is a no-brainier. I'm fed up with those, who for the last 20 months, refused to wear masks, social distance, and refuse to be inoculated, while the rest of us have done our due diligence. This got off the wrong foot back in January 2020, and I partly blame Donald Trump, who has over 600,000 deaths on his hands. And while you're at it, ask the ER doctors and nurses who have to deal with this. Do holdouts have the right to refuse and infect those around  them?  I think not."
2021-07-27 13:25:29,"It would help if the FDA gave full approval for the vaccines rather than conditional emergency approval.  The fact that the vaccines don't have full approval is one of the excuses people use for not getting vaccinated, and it hinders vaccine requirements by private and commercial organizations.  Why is full approval taking so long?

The mainstream media likes to paint this as just a problem with conservative Republicans.  But the Black community and Hispanics are also extremely resistant.  Look at the shockingly low rate of vaccinations among nursing home caregivers -- the majority of whom are Black.  Btw, I'm a conservative Republic as are most of my friends.  We all jumped on the first opportunity to get vaccinated."
2021-07-27 13:25:44,"If you’re talking about hoping a bunch of people who don’t take a vaccine die off, like I see some of you saying, it’s pretty monstrous, but it’s also really telling. It means the reason you want people to get vaccinated/stay home/do whatever has nothing to with saving lives. It has to do with cultural spite. 

People should get vaccinated. People should also not want the unvaccinated to die. 

And healthcare is a human right so stop saying people should have it taken away."
2021-07-27 13:25:46,"The level of anger and self righteousness on this thread would not be so high if everyone acknowledged that it's not just Trump supporters who are refusing the vaccine.
Apparently, government workers in deep blue cities like Los Angeles and NYC require compulsion as well to do the right thing."
2021-07-27 13:25:55,"I would turn the unvaccinated with COVID away at the hospital doors. That sounds cold hearted, but these people need to accept responsibility for their actions. I don’t think they have a justifiable reason for occupying a bed in an ICU."
2021-07-27 13:26:29,"If someone wants to be a 'rugged individualist' and refuse to get vaccinated at this point, then they should should be forced to take all responsibility for the consequences. That's what rugged individualism is all about. Unless there's a really good excuse for not being vaccinated, my taxes and medical insurance should not be paying for somebody else's outrageous medical bills when they were unvaccinated. The exact same people who hate taxes and socialized medical care have zero problem with letting other people pay for their huge medical bills when they end up in the hospital."
2021-07-27 13:26:37,"I think insurance and Medicare should make an announcement that they will not cover hospitalization for the unvaccinated a month from now. It’s about $12k a day when in ICU, we as a society should not bare that cost for people who are not doing their part. As for the return of restrictions, the officials should not move the goal post for us that did our part to accommodate the unvaccinated. I think that is an unacceptable outcome."

  The unvaccinated woman from upstate NY who says ""Society will just have to wait for us,""  is delusional.  The virus is the problem here... and it is not waiting.    And people like her, who choose to go unvaccinated are spreading the virus... and are a threat to society.
    -- The real danger now is that the virus returns with a vengeance in the fall & winter.. and that new & more virulent strains of virus emerge.  - And this danger is created by the unvaccinated.

--  It seems some form of mandates will be best for the country."
2021-07-27 13:27:56,"The “carrot” hasn’t worked, so maybe it’s time to go to the “stick.” States and local governments have tried to incentivize their residents to get the vaccine by running lotteries and offering other rewards. It hasn’t worked. How about denying medical treatment to those who refuse for no good reason at all to get vaccinated and later become infected/sick? If members of our communities don’t care enough for themselves and others to get vaccinated, why should scarce and expensive medical resources be used to bring them back to good health when they contract the virus because they have refused vaccination. Innocent lives saved through changed behavior are likely to exceed, many times over, the lives of those who just won’t do the right thing. Maybe that will make a difference. Nothing else seems to. It is true that many ailments resulting from reckless personal behavior are nevertheless treated medically, e.g., smokers are treated for lung cancer and drug/alcohol abusers are treated for their addictions. But generally, that risky behavior doesn’t have the same potential to endanger other innocent members of the public as does the selfish and senseless refusal by many to get vaccinated. This is different."

At some point that kind of thing will create a huge wealth gap between those States with mandates and those without. Large companies will leave such States for safer pastures.

If one believes in God and that one answers for one's actions...

What do you say when God says ""I sent you a miracle to save my people and you fought to deny it to them and helped kill hundreds of thousands of your fellow humans. Why should I admit you to Heaven?"" 

Full Disclosure: I am an atheist but I ask this question seriously.

If you truly believe and are you perpetuate vaccine denial do you not fear Eternal Damnation or do you think merely saying the words ""I am a Christian"" is a free pass into Heaven regardless of how badly you behave in life?

There are many thigs we have to do if we want to live in a society with other people. We must do those things that make personal interactions as smooth as possible without compromising our personal code of ethics. Getting vaccinated to prevent the spread of Covid19 is one of those things we must all do. Anyone who believes that vaccination is some sort of government hoax after all that has happened and all that has been written about simply doesn't belong in any civilized social gathering. Vaccination must be made mandatory for attending any type of social gathering where a respiratory virus can be transmitted from one to another. Vaccination is a social duty, there should be no choice involved."

The piece warns ""a tougher stance may backfire."" So what? These ""angry"" resisters have declared a kind of war on the larger society. It has already backfired.

Enough, Ms. Harris, you and others like you are putting yourself, your family, your community, and your country at risk.

The cost of a hospitalization for COVID-19 is very high.  If someone chooses not to be vaccinated, when it is clear that vaccination prevents expensive hospitalizations, that person should be personally responsible for all or a portion of the cost of the hospitalization.  Maybe they should be responsible for the first 20% of the hospitalization fee before Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance kicks in.  
Also, companies that self -insure should make vaccination a condition for employment. Why should private companies and stockholders foot the bill for employees who refuse to take the vaccine which prevents hospitalization?

Barring the spreaders from restaurants, movies, subways etc., won't work.  Look at the map showing the hotspots.  The backwoods of the Ozarks, the Mississippi delta, the barrens of the wild West.  Those folks don't have the wherewithal or inclination to do these things."

We are not asking everyone to charge an enemy position (that's the healthcare workers and scientists), but we should reasonably expect that people do not cooperate and support the enemy, Covid.

I have a friend whose objection to the vaccine is the hoary old bit about cells from aborted fetuses used in the vaccine development.

I find it unforgivable that she feels more sympathy toward children who were never born than to toward Mr. Robertson's actual living children, particularly the one with serious health conditions. 

(Not to mention apparently feeling no empathy toward Mr. Robertson himself, and all the other parents, grandparents, etc. who are being driven mad with worry for their vulnerable loved ones.)

Ignorance is not an excuse at this point. The refusers absolutely know that all around them people are dying of this and will continue to die of this. Daily deaths predicted to triple by mid-October - but let's have a pity party for fetuses aborted decades ago."

There are no stats to back up this claim. So is this a news story or an opinion piece?  If you want some gossip, I know people who didn't get vaccinated because President Biden recently said we have the virus on the run--apparently not.

The seeds of this moral and political decline, sown in the 1940's and 1950's, were amply nourished during the rise of Goldwater Libertarianism in the 60's, and furthered by the Far Right and its conspiracy theories in the 1990's and beyond.

We all are familiar with seatbelt laws and 'No shirt, no shoes, no service' signs in restaurants.  Similarly, you cannot parade nude on a public beach just because you want to feel free.  And let's not forget mandatory vaccine laws for childhood diseases.

The only way to stop this selfishness is to impose sanctions on those who endanger their fellow citizens.  Following long-established legal precedents that allow government to impose penalties and enforce stern measures in epidemics, encouraging businesses to exclude employees who refuse vaccines and perhaps even threatening funding to states whose leaders fail to adequately carry out disease-preventing measures may be the only way to stop the Quixotic or selfish behaviors being manifested by so many of our countrymen."

Meanwhile those of us who are vaccinated are biting our nails down to our knuckles as there are more breakthrough cases, wondering if eventually the virus mutates far beyond the capacities of the vaccine to inhibit it. It’s amazing to me that they’ve done enough ‘research’ to know it was a an emergency ok from the FDA, but ignore the decades of research that went into the development of the vaccine. On the one hand, I want them to get sick and die because they refuse, but I know that isn’t compassionate, and I am a compassionate person. Getting vaccinated is a civic duty, an act to benefit all humanity. Since I can’t grab them by the lapels and shake some sense into them, I can only hope they see the light before they wind up walking into it."

I keep hearing the anti-vaccine folks feel their “freedom” is being denied if they are required to get a shot.  The way my parents raised me was to understand that freedom isn’t free…..it comes complete with a set of responsibilities.  When I read this article the first thing that came to my mind was “provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare.”  A society isn’t free if individuals are allowed to harm their neighbors.  Government is responsible to provide security for all members of society.  Citizens are responsible to see that the government functions properly.  We don’t get to make it up as we choose for only our own fanciful ideas."
2021-07-27 13:39:16,"As much as I am angry at the individuals who have chosen not to be vaccinated, I am even angrier at the leadership of the Republican party for allowing the anti-vax misinformation to be propagated.   While there's no single cause for people refusing to get vaccinated, a substantial portion of our population has not been vaccinated because their Republican leaders purposely turned vaccination (and other precautions) into a perverse political issue.  Imagine how much better our progress against this pandemic would have been had the Republican party acknowledged the seriousness of the virus from the get-go and strongly encouraged their fellow Americans to get vaccinated once the vaccines became available.
We are just beginning to hear a change of tune within the party now that they recognize that many of their own constituents are going to suffer and die.
As far as I'm concerned it's an easy connect the dots - the Republican party is the reason America hasn't defeated this virus.  They should all be held accountable."
2021-07-27 13:45:30,"Like many others, I have been fully vaccinated for 3  months and am greatly disappointed by the outsized minority of U.S. residents who continue to be unvaccinated and are the cause of more illness, suffering, and death. A return to more restrictions and economic challenges does not bring joy, but they are necessary, and I know where most blame is to be attributed.

Part of me is cheering on the brave organizations, small-to-large, that are imposing COVID-19 vaccination mandates. On the flip-side, I am trying hard to have empathy for the masses that have been indoctrinated, early or later in life, to live their lives guided by the medical folk wisdom held strong by many families and cultures, even if the so-called wisdom has been disproven by teams of well-regarded medical scientists. 

If and when COVID-19 vaccines used in the US. — under provisional use authorization — achieve full approval by the FDA, the oft used defenses of vaccine hesitant individuals become moot in my thinking. “I don’t trust the vaccine because it was rushed” or “I’m worried about the side effects” arguments will become even more silly, and my forced empathy will be imperceptible. 

My internal ethical compass dictates that the well-being of humanity is a far stronger ideal than being kind, accepting, and loving to all. If that means some hesitant-resistant-defiant individuals lose their livelihood, preferred lifestyle, access, etc., while having to pay much higher insurance premiums, so be it!"

As a retired healthcare executive who got vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was available, I find refusal unconscionable. We mandated TB and hepatitis testing, gave out free flu shots and smoking cessation programs to staff, provided special protection to pregnant women and staff working with toxic agents, and restricted when people with contagious conditions could work. No employer, and especially no health care employer, should tolerate vaccine refusal nonsense. When smoking was banned indoors, workers who smoked were told too bad. Stop smoking or work elsewhere. Same with Covid. BTW, I voted twice for Trump."

Yes, it will be tricky to find the right approach but the time to push is long past.   I don't think you can stick people with the hospital bills etc but there are many other restrictions that can be used.  We have lost our way pandering to a minority."

The University requires that all students and employees be vaccinated-but they have left a giant loophole: you don’t need to get vaccinated if there is a medical reason forbidding it, your religion forbids it, or you have a philosophical reason for not taking the vaccine. The first point I agree with. But this is 2021, not the dark ages: if you want to practice a religion that forbids you from taking a vaccine, or you have a philosophical reason for not taking it, you are perfectly free to leave the country and attend college elsewhere. Am I angry that a place of learning allows those exemptions? You bet I am!"

I'm trying really hard to maintain a level of patience, grace and understanding for the vaccine hesitant. I know they are scared; we've all been through a lot of fear and loss the last year and a half.

But it's also hard to put into words what it's like to wake up every day wondering if your precious child will get exposed simply by playing with a friend. And if positive, if she'll be the statistic that ends up hospitalized--or worse.

I'm tired of people assuming kids will be fine if infected. Yes, they do tend to do better than adults on average. But tell that to the grieving parents who lost their child. You don't know how your kid will react until they get infected, and someone has to be the stat.

Please, please -- get vaccinated. If not for you, than for the kids."

As individuals who are part of society we all have an obligation to protect our neighbor, particularly young children who cannot be vaccinated as well as people who are immunocompromised.    To those who are scared of the vaccine, life is full of risks whether it's driving in your car or crossing the street.   You can choose to never leave your house but your freedom of choice should not extend to putting your neighbor's life in jeopardy or risking a health-care worker's life when you end up in hospital.  Either take the vaccine or retreat from society!    This pandemic will remain with us forever unless everyone steps up and takes the vaccine as part of their civic responsibility.    If not, then the Government should follow France's example and ban the unvaccinated from public places."

2021-07-27 13:45:39,"Why shouldn't we be angry? I put my life on complete hold for more than year, because as a healthcare worker I was at a greater risk of exposure, and thus of exposing other people to the virus. I was irritated when I saw people totally disregarding masks and distancing, but at least then it was their own lives that they were affecting the most.... Now it's very much mine. 

I should have my life back now - I'm vaccinated, under 67, have no immune compromising conditions and no co-morbidities that should affect how well the vaccine has worked for me. I should be very, very safe to be around, yet here we are with talks about new restrictions all because of vaccine refusers. I'm feeling very much done - they can stay home, they can wear masks, they can put plans on hold or they can face and take responsibility for the consequences if they get sick. It's not my problem any longer. 

If I had a young child or a condition that made me more vulnerable even when vaccinated, I'm sure I'd be even more angry..."

You can't do that all the time, but that doesn't mean that there are not times when this is the right thing to do."
2021-07-27 13:55:57,I have run out of patience with the unvaccinated and their uninformed and misinformed excuses. I’m tired of hearing “it’s my rights and personal freedoms”.  Is it their right to put innocent lives at risk for serious illness and possible death?  I’m tired of it all.
2021-07-27 14:03:16,"I look at the data from the recent Provincetown outbreak: 69% of the 342 cases (Mass residents) were in vaccinated individuals (breakthrough cases).  You can see these similar data points all over the country -- and the world, frankly (i.e., Iceland, UK, Israel, Gibraltar, Singapore...).

Mainstream ""experts"" like Fauci and Osterholm are beginning to concede that the vaccine's efficacy at preventing infection, and possibly transmission, may be much lower than anticipated.  Blame it on Delta...

So the vaccine in the end becomes a question of personal risk mitigation, and all the experts say that different groups have very different risk profiles.  People should have conversations with their doctors and make responsible decisions given their own unique risk profiles and medical history.

There is no scientific proof that unvaccinated are somehow responsible for the variants when infection rates among both cohorts (vax and unvaxx) are converging.  Establishment experts and media always admit this is just a theory without any real evidence behind it.

Everything else is conversation.  You can tell that we're in a state of religious hysteria when people are making these types of comments:

This is what everyone is wrestling with and while I recognize the dilemma, people are getting infected and continuing to die. This is unacceptable."
2021-07-27 14:09:05,"All this talk about ""freedom"" is ridiculous. These people are part of society, they benefit from it - and they have obligations to it. You can split hairs on who has the authority to mandate what by splitting the lines between the Federal and State Governments if you want, but at the end of the day, you don't have true ""freedom."" You still have to wear seat belts. You still have to pay taxes. You cannot just walk up to someone and assault them. I mean, you *could* choose to not comply - but you will suffer the consequences. It is time to mandate this and for these people to suffer consequences for not doing it (and I'm not just talking about catching COVID). You want to benefit from society? You have to follow its rules.
P.S. - Whether it is an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" or a full approval from the FDA, that doesn't change the fundamentals of how this virus works or how the vaccine works against it. This is a semantic argument designed to distract from the fact that this virus is a societal threat and we need everyone to do their part. If you had a fire and gave everyone a bucket of water and the *choice* on whether to use it, how successful do you think that would be? Large scale threats require coordinated, mandated responses. If you don't like it, too bad. You *chose* to be here."
2021-07-27 14:10:40,"""Society just has to wait for us""?!. Honestly what an entitled thing to say. While society is ""waiting for you,"" people are getting ill! Yes, I am ready for full FDA authorization and mandates."

Times' up. Any state serious about not finding themselves stuck in a Groundhog Day of disease, economic decay, and depression needs to mandate proof of vaccination for any public leisure or entertainment activity. Want to go unvaccinated? Fine. But want to eat out, see a movie, attend a basketball game, go to a bar, or see a concert? Then show us you're fit for a public gathering amid a pandemic.

They need to grow up, or forego their usual public pastimes. If they're going to stick to their Medieval mentalities, they can live Medieval leisure lives."
2021-07-27 14:03:40,"A bit late to comment now, but this is very significant:
There has always been a strain of oppositional defiance in the US, even when common sense needs to rise to the level of action. That vaccination refusal follows, generally, along the political path of the right, is very telling because what people are saying through their refusal is that the other doesn’t matter and the other must be subservient to my world view. These are life and death situations and another surge by way of the Delta variant is waiting in the wings!"

Yet I am not angry at the unvaccinated people. I am angry at employers who would not provide lower wage people with sick leave if they had vaccination side effects. I am angry at the CDC for dropping its masks for all indoors mandates--how could they  possibly think unvaxxed people would still wear masks?  I am angry at  state and local governments that dropped all COVID-19/21-Delta precaution protocols."
2021-07-27 13:57:24,"Quarantine laws have been on the books for many years, applied to diseases like typhoid and TB.  Covid is deadly and mutating.

Politicians and ""entertainers"" such as on Fox and similar networks who advocate against public health measures are to be seen as soliciting criminal conduct - the breaking of quarantines. We have seen the result of allowing these ignorant anti-vaxxers running amok and those shilling a fast political advantage from them. Time to end the charade.

2021-07-27 14:05:03,"As a professor at State University of NY, Fashion Institute of technology I believed it was my personal responsibility to get vaccinated which I did in March.
I am stunned to learn that the administrations policy regarding vaccines for this coming fall semester is they are not required for all faculty, staff and students with of course exemptions for medical or religious exemptions. 
They have advised that those individuals that choose to not get vaccinated will need to provide proof of weekly covid tests showing negative results. 
This is another example of the schools administration completely abdicating its responsibility to protect the health of its faculty, staff and students. 
Most if not all of the individuals involved in this absurd decision will not be stepping foot in a class room and thereby potentially exposing themselves to the virus or any of its variants.
This is not acceptable. This injustice is further compounded by silence from the NY state united teachers union that supposedly represents and protects FIT faculty & teachers. What do we hear from them...the silence is deafening. 

All universities and public schools need to mandate vaccines to protect all faculty, staff and students NOW."
2021-07-27 14:10:07,"Restrictions on activities (theaters, travel, etc) for the un-vaccinated will help some, but there are still many everyday situations where you may be unknowingly be exposed to unvaccinated people.  Masks are currently required for the unvaccinated, but many vaccinated people are still wearing them to take precaution so we're unable to identify from whom we need to keep distance.  

The only option I can see is requiring some type of ID badge or identifier that the unvaccinated will be required to wear in public so that they can be identified.  Of course there would be a lot of pushback (and probably require criminal enforcement), but unfortunately it maybe necessary to get this pandemic under control."

I've felt rising anger the past couple of weeks, doubly so because we have both a substantial minority that will not get vaccinated and a politically opportunistic governor and political party that aids and abets the foolishness. I don't like feeling this way, but I'm not in a small, meanspirited minority, it appears.

I just don't get it:  The lower demographic citizens who fall for the propaganda have the most to lose.  I never understood why they think the Republicans are their saviors; now I can't understand why so many can't figure out those demagogues are a clear and present peril."

Common spaces must post whether they are V or U. Public places require a V at the door, private places, at the option of the owner and client. Both public and private places  must also post notice of Covid statistics in the community (e.g., infections and deaths since onset of pandemic). One imagines that the people wearing the Vs will boycott the places posted with the U. As more and more of those places convert to V, more of the unvaccinated will get vaccinated, while the risk  of exposure also declines.  And for Fake Letters, hefty penalties."
2021-07-27 14:04:42,"Leadership is not and never should be about victim blame; it should always be to protect through action. Now is the time for the Biden administration to act to protect the public health by mandating vaccinations for all federal employees and military personnel; to require proof of vaccination provided by the Department of Health and Human  Services for all interstate travel as allowed under the Interstate Commerce Act; and to urge all corporations, college, and universities, and hospitals to require vaccination of the employees and students (of which the latter to are now legal). There is no downside other than more hospitalizations and death as the highly contagious Delta variant rages across the country. To do nothing is unconscionable and verges on the ""criminal reckless endangerment"" of the population when effective and safe vaccines are available."
2021-07-27 14:06:59,"Here we are, in the U.S., with a surplus of vaccines gone unused while so many countries struggle to make them available to their citizens. The anti-vaccination posture here is unconscionable and incomprehensible, frankly. My patience is exhausted and I support mandates or else a huge country as this is never going to emerge from this world health crisis. The lack of a uniform policy in a politically polarized country is a recipe for disaster."
2021-07-27 14:11:30,"CDC and Biden administration haven't exactly helped the cause with their premature celebrations and the picture they  they tried to paint - that pandemic is over for vaccinated, which in turn raised the expectations of vaccinated and contributed to current frustration and anger. 

I've never stopped masking up despite being fully vaccinated for two months because I've been closely following the development of variants and the devastation caused by them in various countries and understood that it will be a matter of time before we come under the wrath of those variants. 

And with the attitude (disregard for covid) shown by nearly half of the country, many of us realized that this is going to be a log hauler (no pun intended) and we lowered our expectations accordingly.   

If current administration wants to help reduce vaccinated folks' anguish, [administration] should be more pragmatic and less of a sales organization; should stop this overly positive/optimistic drumbeat of fully opening schools, businesses, offices etc., Instead encourage folks to stick with the 'behavrial change'. Everyone around masking up will help expedite the progression towards normalcy than impromptu suggestions to drop mask. That was a glaring mistake which came back to haunt us."
2021-07-27 13:58:01,"I can't help but see this parallel to parenting.  I try very hard to get my kids to do what they should without threats, without force.  I explain why they need to do or not do something.  I treat them like a real, thinking person, with their own thoughts and ideas.  However, sometimes you just have to put your foot down, with the hope that someday they will understand.   Admittedly, it is sometimes hard to determine when switching course is necessary.  With vaccines, that time has come.  We have done everything we can: made them free, made them available at convenient times, given employers tax breaks for time off related to vaccines, handed out coupons, enticed with $1MM lotteries, not to mention explained over and over again why you should get vaccinated.  Its time we step up, like a good parent, and start handing out consequences."
2021-07-27 13:58:46,"I honestly still have a very hard time understanding why the vaccinated are so afraid of the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated are mostly a threat to themselves. Everyone with any meaningful statistical risk of serious harm from Covid has long had the chance to get vaccinated and protect themselves. If they haven’t, I think they have made a bad decision. But I’m not all worked up about it. The vaccine has reduced Covid to essentially the same threat as the flu, pneumonia, and other respiratory illness like RSV. (In fact, flu and pneumonia have always been more deadly for unvaccinated kids than Covid. As for the immunocompromised, who my heart goes out to, they have always faced unique risks and we have never masked just to protect them in the past). As for the emergence of a hypothetical variant that is vaccine resistant, that could happen (it could also mutate out of existence). But it seems mutation will be a threat no matter what given that it will take time vaccinate their world (in fact boosters may prolong that timeframe). If this thing is really being carried by asymptomatic vaccinated folks and is going to become endemic, it seems like we should embrace it and exposure to it.

Unvaccinated should be forced to pay the consequences of their actions in one simple way: we should all stop masking and go about our lives with little thought or care of their foolishly unique circumstances. Let the chips fall where they may."
2021-07-27 13:59:05,"The question arises, why are the vaccinated so concerned about the unvaccinated ?
Everyone has the right to self determination, and since when are the vaccinated the self appointed masters of the unvaccinated ?
If you opted for the vaccine, you surely are convinced that the vaccine is a functional Prophylaxis that will prevent you from contracting Covid-19, so what then is this fuss about, given that the vaccinated didn't care about their neighbors before the vaccine, what could possibly be the driver behind the vaccinated caring about the unvaccinated now ?"
2021-07-27 14:06:29,"This is yet another example of how far we are expected to bend over backwards for those who live in the world of alternative facts. Along with denial of climate change, belief in Italian space lasers changing our votes, Donald Trump winning the last election, and the 1/6 insurrection being nothing more than a tour of the Capitol we are once again implored to show respect for this alternative reality and the poor, misunderstood people who live in it. Misinformation floods the marketplace of social media and public opinion, and we are told that we must treat it as equivalent to reality, that the lunatic ravings of someone who thinks the vaccine implants a microchip are as worthy of consideration as Dr. Fauci’s endorsement of vaccinations.

Haven’t we killed enough people, haven’t we allowed the alternative reality of Qanon and it’s cult-like following to do enough damage, haven’t we bent over backward far enough giving these people the chance to express their concerns, haven’t we provided more than enough solid scientific and medical evidence about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, haven’t we reached the point where the very lives of our families are more important than coddling these people so they don’t feel ostracized?

Mandatory vaccination or mandatory isolation from public accommodation. Period."
2021-07-27 14:12:23,"I understand the anger and frustration. 

Some people are calling for punitive action against unvaccinated people, including hiking health insurance premiums or even outright denial of medical care.

The greatest achievement of the ACA (Obamacare) was the abolishment of pre-existing conditions clauses. Health care should be equal and open to everyone, regardless of conditions or compliance. I favor a system like Canada or the UK. Basing a person’s access to medical care upon arbitrary clauses like compliance is immoral.  Most people don’t follow all their doctor’s recommendations, they do comply with some recommendations while ignoring other recommendations. Who decides which recommendations warrant denial of medical of medical care?  There’s many important vaccines that many people have never gotten or updated. Should these carry penalties too?"
2021-07-27 14:09:39,"A full approval by the FDA would go a long way to reduce at least one avenue of resistance - that the vaccines are only approved for emergency use, somehow implying that they’re still experimental. 
The FDA has still not fully approved these vaccines even with the substantial real-world evidence and post-market safety data that has accrued. Yet they’ve somehow managed to approve for use the new Biogen Alzheimer’s drug on the basis of clinical evidence that has faced serious significant criticism from the scientific community."
2021-07-27 14:00:01,"“As a result of lagging vaccination and lifted restrictions, infections are rising. “

Half true - infections are rising as a result of lifting restrictions too soon.  Any vaccination reduces the number of infections, and lagging vaccination can only reduce the rate of decrease, it can’t increase infections.  The rate of reduction has been overwhelmed by our premature return to “normal” before the battle was won."
2021-07-27 14:00:24,"Fascinating how many people have decided they're experts in virology and epidemiology. A random man in line at the pharmacy thought my friend and I, both over 50, were waiting to be vaccinated and declared, ""Kids don't need the vaccine"". ""The ones who've already died sure don't,"" I said. Realizing we weren't going to play his game, he turned away. Then, to try to puff himself up again as he left, he said, ""Goodbye, GIRLS"". A lot of people are scared and insecure, and they're listening to Republicans who know even less than they do. For all our sakes I hope they've reached the bottom of their deep, deep barrel of ignorance."

Forced camps where the unvaccinated will be quarantined away from the rest of society? The other question is, how can one destroy the enemy without harming the infrastructure? Biological warfare would be one idea run the economy into the ground shut business's and commerce down and you just waltz right in. Don't think this scenario has never been an idea.
 How much longer can countries hold out with lockdowns and business's still hampered by operating at half capacity."
2021-07-27 14:14:12,"Wow. So anyone who refuses the vaccine should be made destitute? That’s the answer in your eyes, and many others it seems.

I just want to understand the thinking better."

2021-07-27 14:04:28,"I know someone who has a proven allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol - an ingredient in the Covid vaccine. He has worn a mask since the beginning of the Pandemic even though he was ridiculed before the mandates. He continues to social distance. He is angry that the population at large flaunted the rules and continued to go to large gatherings, not wear masks etc.  The bottom line is we still need to follow ALL safety protocols to beat the virus. That includes social distancing when possible and wearing YOUR MASK."
2021-07-27 14:07:27,"Speaking for myself, anger is not a ""new feeling,"" as the Homepage subhead suggests. I've been disgusted for months with Americans who refuse to get vaccinated against Covid.

A Few Thoughts:

The sheer Ignorance of those who would risk almost certainty of contracting Covid rather than do their best to ward off the disease is overwhelming.

The sheer Selfishness of these people, who obviously can't care less about the deleterious effect of their refusal on the community, is also overwhelming.

Those who bark that vaccination and mask-wearing should be a ""choice"" are completely off base. It would do well for these contrarians -- AND their lawmaker representatives -- to pair Covid vaccination analogously with seat-belt wearing. Wearing a seat belt while driving is LAW -- as well it should be, because it Protects.

It's high time a Federal LAW make getting a Covid vaccination Mandatory -- as well as mask-wearing for All until every American has been vaccinated."
2021-07-27 14:06:46,"Finally, the tide may be turning in terms of what is considered to be acceptable requirements.

A ""whole of government"" response would solve this problem in weeks. Would radical Republicans scream? You bet, but that's all the more reason to do it soon -- well before the 2022 midterms -- so people can see the benefits."

2021-07-27 14:17:34,"One statistic that should be reported is the political allegiance of each person hospitalised with COVID-19 and particularly of those in intensive care and who die.

If the virus is mainly killing Republican voters it might finally hit the Republican politicians that their crazy rantings might come back to bite them at election time and have them encouraging their supporters who are a huge part of the problem.

It will also help Democrats to target hold outs on their side to act to save their own lives and everyone else's around them."
2021-07-27 14:19:22,"This is as much a national security issue as anything we've dealt with via bombs and drones. The government and the supreme court retain the right, if needed, to conscript people by force. For the good of the country (and the economy and public health - all good for the country as a whole) then they both can and should just make a vaccine mandate and be done with it.

And if people cry about losing the right to choose to be a filthy plague vector? Well, they can go cry online. Meanwhile, the rest of us can be done with covid at last. 

No, Ms. Harris, we won't have to ""just wait"" for the unvaccinated to make a decision. They've made theirs and we choose to indulge them, that's all. Previous generations of Americans wouldn't have put up with this foolishness and, yes, this lack of patriotism and concern for the good of the country as a whole.

In WW2, people had to endure rationing and were asked to buy war bonds out of duty. Today? All you have to do is roll up your sleeve. So do it already."
2021-07-27 14:19:27,"I'm really trying to remember exactly when things turned, and it was probably some time in January.  Remember when accelerating the rollout of the vaccine was termed ""Project Warp Speed"" by the Orange One?  His disciples were all for it back then, so what changed?  Simple - the hatred and anger toward the loss of the election that has propelled the perpetuation the myths and lies regarding the vaccinations. 

What we really need to go back to is learning simple science in schools so that people aren't so susceptible to being misled.  Aside from explaining the science of how and why these vaccines are safe and how they were developed so quickly, very simply: a virus that continually finds host after host will mutate and become resistant to the vaccines, much like bacteria and antibiotic resistance.  If you do not take preventative measures, such as the vaccines and masks (sadly even when vaccinated at this point), it'll be the equivalent to all of us having MRSA and the vaccines (antibiotics) won't really do much for whatever is the prevalent strain at the time. 

Grow up, get vaccinated, and really think about how stupid some of these lies are."

Worse — willing to send the health of their own people down the river, for their own monetary or political benefit!  Shameful beyond words . . ."

Not to mention the toll on the already over-taxed health care workers who would have to take care of these people when they are hospitalized.

Ms. Harris and the rest of the anti-vaxxers should be compelled to get the vaccine."

2021-07-27 14:26:56,"So . . . some anti-vaxers claim to be worried about the possible ""long-term effects"" of the vaccine.

Well, ""long covid""--breathlessness, fatigue, and brain fog that persist even after the initial infection is gone--is a pretty long-term effect. 

 So is, for your information, death.

 Instead of worrying about the chimera of possible long-term effects from the vaccine, maybe you should worry about the  long term effects of not getting it.  They  really do exist and are upon us right now."
2021-07-27 14:15:02,"I have compassion for your anger, but I'd like to offer a viewpoint shared amongst many people that you may rarely hear for worry of being shamed, guilted or further coerced ... I am not a conspiracy believer, nor a science denier, yet I choose to be pharmaceutically unvaccinated. 

How is this possible you say, when it must only be malicious intent, ignorance, and stupidity that millions of people choose not to vaccinate? 

I choose not to submit myself to Fear. Rather, I focus even more on my health and giving my body daily what it needs to naturally give me the best chance of survival.  

I accept that death is a possible, albeit tiny possibility, and while I have compassion for those who have passed, I do not see this as a real threat to my life. 

Coercion, shaming, and mandating is not going make more people get vaccinated nor is driving fear. What we need now is understanding, compassion and yes, Love to fully integrate the experience we've all shared over the last 18 months."

By choosing to get the vaccination, they are ensuring that this pandemic continues forever. Everyone esp., kids are suffering the consequences because of the stubbornness of the unvaccinated people. Also, I hope the media keeps publicizing the basic fact that most of the GOP leaders, congressional reps and Senators are FULLY vaccinated !! The hypocrisy of the GOP is just beyond the pale. 

Whether its withdrawing the state level funding or individual benefits due to anti vaccination stance - it doesn't matter, just enforce it."
2021-07-27 14:30:37,"This reporting is confusing. There are dumb reasons to avoid the vaccine, but there are also legitimate reasons people are refusing the vaccine. One is natural immunity. Thousands of people have made it through CoVid. Some don't want to risk exposure to the vaccine. A health care worker who took care of sick people, got sick themselves, survived it, and now has natural immunity shouldn't be demonized for avoiding a vaccine they don't need, but reporting like this somewhat  demonizes their decision."

Three months later, two million New Yorkers who won't show up for vaccination are pushing the whole city backwards to where we were in the winter.

I want Cuomo to follow France's lead and deploy the Excelsior Pass that we paid for. I don't care whether he does it in the whole state. I want to see him do it here in New York City, where 44% of the state's population lives and where de Blasio, wringing his hands, has proposed a half-baked ""solution"" that won't fix the problem and won't even take effect until September.

Cuomo and de Blasio are effectively saying that it's every man for himself. If that's the attitude, I'll just go to Canada when the border opens next month, and where I have a seasonal home, and wait for reality to sink in here.

Canada is way ahead on vaccination, and cases are going down, not up. The NY Times says that the country is seeing 1 new case per 100,000 people nationally. In the province where my home is, there has not been a single new case in the last week.

I'm not going back to the winter, and if I have to leave the country to avoid that, I'm ready to go."
2021-07-27 14:24:00,"I have a friend whose 87 year old mother, living in Florida, refused to get the vaccine, but finally did get it last week. Seems that Delta may be changing some minds."
2021-07-27 14:26:52,"Please take unaccepted vaccines, and start vaccinating  infants with underlying conditions yesterday. 

Many who refuse to wear masks claim not to believe that they accept handouts from the government every single day. 

Should they be unfortunate enough to contract a serious case of Covid, I would ask that they pay for a private hospital. Why on Earth should overwhelmed health workers with PTSD have to contend with that? They shouldn't. 

How does a person simultaneously insist, angrily, on public assistance, and refuse to assist?

This may well sound angry: I've rescued people, and been responsible for lives in dangerous water. I won't help you anymore, if you choose to go surfing in a hurricane, and no one else I know will either."
2021-07-27 14:17:51,"Are the unvaccinated unconcerned about the cost of their own hospitalisation?  

What about health insurers?"
2021-07-27 14:19:43,"Anger and frustration among the vaccinated, directed at vaccine refuseniks, is understandable and hardly unexpected. In fact, it was bound to happen.

Unfortunately, the same coterie of paranoiacs who refuse to be vaccinated, siting their own personal concerns as being more important than community safety, is also heavily armed.

A measly germ has pushed us one step closer to a new Civil War."
2021-07-27 14:22:57,"Governor Cuomo today said that $15 million will be spent for vaccine outreach in areas with low vaccination rates. ""Many of the locations are in poor, largely minority communities,"" Cuomo said.

Some of the comments advocating for refusal of medical treatment and denial of health insurance coverage for unvaccinated people are grotesque. 

It seems mainly the poor and largely minority communities, at least in NY state, are not vaccinated. Where is the empathy?"
2021-07-27 14:27:23,"Society shouldn't have to wait for the unvaccinated to learn their lessons the hard way, all the while infecting others and overloading our patient providers and hospitals. The twenty to fifty somethings that are the root of this debilitating virus no longer deserve just our pity but to be penalized for threatening the lives of others just as those who drive despite being under the influence of alcohol or drugs deserve punishment. 
Don't tread on us."
2021-07-27 14:27:41,"I totally agree. I'm angry. These people are a drag on the economy, generally. They are also impacting my day-to-day life in major negative ways. It's outrageous. 

These vaccinations should be required, except for the very few who have a medical reason to avoid the vaccines."
2021-07-27 14:28:03,Eliminate contact with all relatives and anyone else who refuse to get vaccinated - especially indoors. Its not complicated - there are no gray areas.
2021-07-27 14:19:03,"How about no travel across state boarders for anyone unvaccinated, other than supply transportation?  When people in Connecticut can't go anywhere or see anyone in New York etc.  My state is really vaccinating up, seeing license plates from states that are spiking and poorly vaccinated irks me.  Make them stay in their state, don't come to mine...we're not protecting you, we are trying hard to protect ours."
2021-07-27 14:23:45,"My wife and I were fully vaccinated back at the start of February. I can appreciate how an anti-vaccine posture by some incites anger in of those who have followed the guidance of medical experts and gotten vaccinated. I always find myself surprised at those working in the medical community who refuse to get vaccinated. This is especially true of those in the military medical community (i.e., I’m a veteran and receive my healthcare at military facilities; the rate of refusal at my local military clinic is difficult to comprehend).

That said, while understandably, the anger is not helpful. Perhaps the current “pandemic of the unvaccinated” will change minds, though I’m not hopeful as I recall a middle-aged couple with who I recently shared a crowded—by pandemic standards—elevator. When some on the elevator became concerned about the crowding we each shared our vaccination status. The middle-aged couple proudly declared that they we vaccinated “naturally” by catching COVID. The also proclaimed that they had not and would never get vaccinated as they did not believe in the vaccination campaign rolled out by President Biden. I could only wonder what would change minds in the face of something like that. 

In the middle of the pandemic, I found myself fully convinced that the former president would kill us all with his divisiveness and we would not survive physically, morally, or politically if he was re-elected. His loss did not save us—we, as a people, are fatally flawed."

2021-07-27 14:15:31,"We need vaccine mandates for schools. We need a remote option for school. In 4 weeks I am being forced to send my daughter back into a classroom with very little distancing and parents in town are screaming to remove masks. She is vaccinated. So are my husband and I. But I am very high-risk and am being told by my doctor to double down again. And those saying ""just homeschool"", tell me how. I have a high school junior getting ready to apply to colleges. I was told switching to home school doesn't guarantee that she will qualify to graduate.  The school district hasn't learned from last year at all. Sending unvaccinated younger kids to school with the ""unmask our kids"" parents screaming every chance they get. If one child is vulnerable and masks will keep that child safe, keep the masks on. If they don't want their kids wearing masks, why don't they stay home?"
2021-07-27 14:20:41,My fear is that a variant is coming that is resistant to the vaccines. For that I totally blame the unvaccinated - and the Republicans who politicized this issue.
2021-07-27 14:26:45,"I figured we were in trouble when the mask advice went on the Honor System. Why would anyone assume that the people ,who didn’t want to wear masks in the first place, would wear them because they hadn’t been vaccinated?"
2021-07-27 14:28:15,"Very thankful that my doctor is not seeing unvaccinated patients in the office. It reassures me that my doctor will be safe, that I will be safe in the office and that the highest possible current safety standards have been chosen.
For patients that chose not to vaccinate, there's telehealth. Choices have consequences."
2021-07-27 14:29:21,It ‘s interesting reading this article that people need more time before deciding whether to take the vaccine. The one person at a time approach. Obviously Mother Nature has not received the memo given the escalating number of new infections.
2021-07-27 14:14:32,"I see no reason that every agency in the USG, and in every state government, should fail to follow the example of the VA and require every employee to be vaccinated, and those who refuse should be placed on unpaid furlough."
2021-07-27 14:22:48,"It's hard to understand all of the angst.  All in the US should be proud of what's been done so far.  Starting from zero, over 150 million people have been vaccinated, and the process continues with hundreds of thousands every day.  If you're vaccinated and worried about a new variant, continue to wear a mask when in a public setting indoors and don't worry about anyone else!  It's really very simple."
2021-07-27 13:58:38,"Finally, the right people are getting angry."
2021-07-27 14:07:00,"I sometimes get to the point where I think the red states should just secede.  Republican leadership and policy over the past few decades  has delivered massive inequality, an ill-conceived war, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, accelerating climate disasters, and now a pandemic that is more deadly than it needs to be.  Maybe it’s time to stop cleaning up after these folks.  Let them take their snake flags  and fend for themselves.  Let them be “free.”  It would be interesting to see who they’d try to blame for their problems then."
2021-07-27 14:15:26,"I have a relative who refuses to get vaccinated. I (nicely) told her people who refuse to get vaccinated are hurting the economy, and could trigger lockdowns again. My words literally... did. not. compute. Because, everything is the fault of ""liberals,"" right?"
2021-07-27 14:31:26,"I am beyond furious at the unvaccinated (medical exemptions respected - some drugs “don’t play well” with others). I am in my 70s and this pandemic - largely preventable had DT acknowledged and acted on what he knew in January, 2020 - has cost me one of my limited years remaining. I don’t want my insurance premiums to pay for other people’s stupidity. This is the part of the script where we had better trust science, not religion or politics. I am out of words printable enough to qualify this comment for publication."
2021-07-27 13:46:43,"In Austin Texas our Travis County average daily death rate due to COVID has been between 0 and 1 people since May according to the CDC, or less than the flu and car accidents.  This is in the low vaccinated state of Texas.  Maybe anger or fear have nothing to do with vaccine rates?  

Google it."
2021-07-27 14:02:02,"Angry at FDA for taking its sweet time in approving these vaccines.  Yet, they rush that Alzheimers drug out the door and it doesn't even work!  

I say shame on FDA for letting us down.  If they had their entire staff on this project, it would have been approved in a week."
2021-07-27 14:07:32,"The FDA, which has granted Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should adhere to the first rule in Medicine is ""First, do no harm.""

Millions have received these two vaccines and the results are in. Both are remarkably safe and effective in every tested group. Coronavirus infection is variable in severity, from asymptomatic to deadly.Variants have developed and more will arise in the cells of the bodies of those who are still getting infected.

The large pool of bodies to harbor these viral replicator factories are the non vaccinated resistors and anti-vaxxers.

Despite all evidence that coronavirus is real and poses a threat to all who come in contact with non-immune individuals, they show a careless disregard for their own safety and that of others. Some of these people will find out that they or those they love will die unnecessarily because of their behavior.

The FDA should meet remotely and approve the vaccines immediately. 

To use a metaphor, our ship has hit the iceberg and is taking on water, the lifeboats have been lowered and many passengers are in the water, some wearing life jackets, some not. Urgent action is needed to save lives. Time is vital. 

Approve the vaccines NOW! Inoculate everyone ""in the water"" before they drown! 

Mandate vaccination and require proof to enter public spaces and events.

Make America Safe Again!"
2021-07-27 14:27:45,"“I shouldn’t be judged or forced to make a decision,” Ms. Harris said. “Society will just have to wait for us.”

Yes and when you get infected and are deadly ill,  you will 'just have to wait ' for medical treatment."

In the words of GWB, if you're not with us, you're against us."
2021-07-27 13:54:42,The anger of the vaccinated is well placed. I am vaccinated and I am more angry at Republican governors like DeSantis who aid and abet anti vaxxers by supporting laws that prohibit private entities from requiring vaccination of their patrons and employees. What happened to private property rights that republicans are so fond of supporting. DeSantis is not stupid. He knows better. If you cant serve in office with integrity get out of politics
2021-07-27 14:38:08,They need to start mandating it and pull the insurance coverage for the unvaccinated. We have enough vaccine to cover everyone 3-4X and if by now you selected not to get it why should you get care for free
2021-07-27 14:31:34,"I’m extremely angry. I’ve done everything I was supposed to do. Everything. I got the vaccine; I didn’t think twice about it. But now, because of the unvaccinated, my family is at risk again. The conspiracy theories, the stupid, flat out lies, the things that normally intelligent people believe - it amazes me- 
I’m very angry, I’ll say it again. There is absolutely no reason we should be where we are in this pandemic right now."
2021-07-27 14:32:47,"This is just where the country will be for the next few decades and journalism, as it does, will just keep writing articles about it.  Same, same but different."
2021-07-27 14:35:03,"You know what's a real ""tough stance?"" Death for the ungrateful self-important willfully unvaccinated. 

And that's not coming from the anger of the vaccinated: that's going to come courtesy of COVID-19 whether the unvaccinated believe in science or not."
2021-07-27 14:36:12,"The number one job of our elected mayors, governors and The President is to keep the people in their jurisdiction safe. Last year many including the former president failed and there are 400,000 of my fellow Americans that are dead, because they failed. Last year many of my fellow Americans failed to follow public health guidelines and government mandates, they were selfless and Un-American.

Yes I am very angry, because every day Americans are dying how should be. The elected mayors and governors who this year are continuing to fail to do their job and the Americans who refuse to get vaccinated are killers. The need to be held accountable and the burden to stop the virus must be placed squarely on them."
2021-07-27 14:36:37,"I am vaccinated but know thoughtful people who are still hesitant.  They have two concerns, and have heard – not the “Facebook 12” – but others who seem to have some scientific background, articulating them.  

Trusted, non-political, knowledgeable person(s), should speak out:  these either are not concerns and why not, or if they are, their risks are far outweighed by covid risks, or yes they are a reason to stay unvaccinated and bear the covid risk. 
 
One of the concerns is the use of mRNA:  “isn’t this ‘too new’ to be used in humans, and how do we know its long term effects?”  (Don’t we have human trials from previous attempts to use this for vaccines? )

The other concern is regarding nanoparticles in the vaccines:  “Are these new in vaccines?  Do they stay in the body?  Where do they go?”"
2021-07-27 14:19:33,Let’s make being vaccinated a requirement to purchase a gun. Most of these holdouts will be running to get the shot.
2021-07-27 14:31:03,"""Society will just have to wait for us.""

Such self-important, entitled drivel.  An insult to anyone with a brain and a conscience - do they think we were born yesterday?

I can't take this anymore.  The most uneducated, selfish people in our communities are holding everyone else's health hostage.

On one side we have that, and on the other, we have experts telling us to make sure we're nice to these people, lest they make things worse for us.

What about my rights?  And the rights of my unvaccinated young son?  Why are we as a society so concerned about the feelings of selfish people over the right to live for the rest of us?

Oh right.  Money and power.  There are people out there monetizing and pinning reelection hopes on vaccine hesitancy.  They themselves are all vaccinated of course..."
2021-07-27 14:34:31,I would not allow unvaccinated people to be admitted to hospitals for COVID treatment.  They can go home and live or die with the consequences of their actions.
2021-07-27 14:36:14,Just like NYC did with Typhoid Mary - time to open up detention centers for those who refuse to be vaccinated. Their misplaced sense of individual freedom cannot trump civic responsibility to control an infectious disease that threatens us all. Lock them up!
2021-07-27 14:31:16,"Maybe we should put the onus on the people who spread the illness. If you give the virus to someone, and they die or suffer long term consequences, you should be prosecuted or fined. Vaccinated people would be exempt, because they did what they could to prevent illness and transmission. The unvaccinated obviously don’t care about the common good; risk to their own pocketbooks might persuade them. Then maybe they would at least wear masks and keep their distance."
2021-07-27 14:32:16,"No, I will not ""just wait"" for you to do the right thing.

Do what is right for your community, and the economy will flourish.

Do what is right for your family, and your loved ones will live longer lives.

Do what is right for the common good, and you will do what is right for yourself.

How do people not see this?"
2021-07-27 14:35:44,"I’m incredibly angry. None of these unvaccinated people are thinking about anyone but themselves. Again, people are having to put life events on hold because there are unvaccinated people in their families—weddings, funerals—not to mention preventing kids from getting to go back to school for in person instruction, which they badly need. That’s the part that really makes me angry. Do it for the KIDS, our future, people!"
2021-07-27 14:36:57,"I can’t help but think of relatives overseas who would happily take the shots Americans are mindlessly turning down. Could we please ship unused vaccines to the countries where people are desperate for it? Why waste time, energy and such a valuable resource on people who won’t help themselves? At the very least, by increasing global vaccination rates, we help minimize the threat of future variants."
2021-07-27 14:35:08,"As a nurse, this is setting us up for another wave. It's already blowing up in Arkansas, and parts of the south, and now...Delta is in the Northeast. 
Unfortunately, this could become catastrophic if our citizens continue to be this stubborn. And, for those of us in health care, we will be bombarded again. 
While it is true that children (so far) have not gotten as sick as adults, we don't know too much about the effects of Delta.
School starts soon. If children become seriously ill from Delta because adults failed to protect them by getting their vaccines, what then? What does that say about our civic duty? 
Actually, this saddens me."
2021-07-27 14:38:12,"I'm furious at the willfully unvaccinated.  They are truly condemning us to Covid for the rest of our lives and they will cause many dangerous variants to emerge.  They should be shunned by everyone because they are dangerous, both mentally and physically."
2021-07-27 14:32:13,With the recent Breakthrough Infections in Providence etc -- is there any information or whether unvaccinated folks had  worse reactions than the vaccinated?  and any sense of whether the unvaccinated were the spreaders or whether both groups spread equally?
2021-07-27 14:33:08,The time for persuasion is over and individual feelings are irrelevant. Collectively the unvaccinated are a crucible for mutations--imagine the chaos if a mutation escapes vaccinated immunity. It is time for mandates and vaccine passports for all indoor activities.
2021-07-27 14:39:13,"Those who refuse to be vaccinated yammer on about freedom. But freedom isn't free, it requires responsibility. They say requiring vaccination is un-Constitutional and that is completely wrong.

This matter was settled in Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.

I am angry but mostly at the liars out there, including some who are profiting, by convincing the gullible they shouldn't get vaccinated."
2021-07-27 14:39:20,"One rationale I hear for ""hesitancy"" is that the vaccine remains officially as ""experimental"",  not fully approved, and also the notion that for healthy younger adults without underlying conditions that covid is not that bad..  Therefore why take an experimental vaccine if its not really necessary.  

These are not irrational considerations, and hopefully can be addressed clearly and more loudly by public health."
2021-07-27 14:32:04,Maybe insurers could wave hospitalization copay or deductibles for vaccinated Covid-19 hospitalizations? Pretty small costs related to the potential to provide another incentive to get a free vaccine.
2021-07-27 14:32:24,"Not everyone who chooses not to be vaccinated is a conspiracy theorist, selfish or irresponsible.  After consults with three physicians and considerable research from respected medical sources, I opted out of the vaccine due to having multiple autoimmune conditions.  

From the CDC website:  ""People with autoimmune conditions may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions. People from this group were eligible for enrollment in some of the clinical trials. More information about vaccine clinical trials can be found below.""

My decision was not an easy one and requires that I remain highly vigilant to protect myself and others.  I'm tired of the isolation and would love to return to a normal life.  Thankfully, I am still working from home, go out only when necessary, always wear a mask indoors in any public space, and continue to socially distance.  My husband, who works in healthcare and is vaccinated, wears a mask at work and follows the same protocol.  All of our vaccinated friends do the same.  

Still, 100% protection even with the best precautions is certainly not guaranteed.  To suggest that healthcare bills be completely paid for by those who become infected if not vaccinated is a bit much."
2021-07-27 14:34:02,not getting vaccinated is criminally negligent.
2021-07-27 14:33:48,The only thing I have seen convince the vaccine hesitant is requiring them to get it to travel by airplane or to keep their jobs.
2021-07-27 14:40:42,"My employer-provided insurance charges smokers hundreds of dollars a month extra to be on their plan. Why not have insurance companies that work through employers do this for the unvaccinated? Like smokers, their expected health care costs are much higher than for those who are vaccinated. And while employers haven't been willing to require proof of vaccination, insurance companies have never had a problem requiring proof for medical issues. Also, unlike quitting smoking, it's pretty easy to get vaccinated. Get a shot, or pay up and at least help defray the cost."
2021-07-27 14:31:31,"The vaccinated have a right to be free from exposure to the unvaccinated. Therefore, any individual or business that wants to uphold the rights of the vaccinated has a legal right to do so. It is not unlawful for private parties to discriminate against people who threaten their health by not getting vaccinated.  When more and more venues rightfully exclude the unvaccinated, the vaccinated will be better protected against breakthrough infection, and hopefully more unvaccinated will join the ranks of the vaccinated. No way we should prefer the rights of the unvaccinated over the rights of the vaccinated."
2021-07-27 14:35:54,"Yeah, I have no sympathy for these people.

I keep hearing how we need to treat their concerns with respect if we want to convince them vaccines are safe.

Too bad. I’m sick of pandering to conspiracy crackpots. They’re grown adults, not delicate children. It’s time they take some personal responsibility. If not, they deserve all the derision coming their way."
2021-07-27 14:39:41,"The most outstanding feature of the Republicans is their conviction that freedom comes without any responsibility. They are entitled to it, it covers every facet in their lives."
2021-07-27 14:32:54,I agree with the nurse: Those who refuse vaccination should be refused insurance coverage for treatment.
2021-07-27 14:33:54,"I think the federal govenment should do all that it can to increase the vaccination rate, including withholding funds from those who refuse.  Iowa has already acted against vaccine mandates from colleges and universities in the state who receive funds from the state.  When a hospital group with several hospitals in Iowa announced a mandate, the legislature had ""questions"" for the group.  Idiocy is the only reason that our vax rate is around 46% and some doses will likely be thrown away when they expire soon.  So very sad for our state and our country."
2021-07-27 14:37:08,"Unfortunately, civic duty seems to have become a concept of the past. ""Fake"" individual freedom now appears to dominate amongst those who refuse to get vaccinated. A year ago, we didn't have a cure for COVID; now we do. There is no excuse any longer to refuse to get vaccinated. It's not just about protecting yourself, but others. That's what it is all about."
2021-07-27 14:39:55,"I'm honestly more angry at the vaccinated that think the pandemic is over just because they're safe. My son is not eligible for the vaccine and is higher risk. Yet the college I work at is taking zero precautions: no vaccine mandates, no masking, no social distancing, no upgraded ventilation systems, no testing. In their town hall meeting for instructors they said those with immunocompromised families can just wash their hands and change their clothes when they get home, and everything will be ok. They are even hosting massive celebration events to mark the end of the pandemic. There's no acknowledgement that for some of us the pandemic is far from over. They're vaccinated, they're safe, and nobody else matters."
2021-07-27 14:36:34,"Imagine a world where some drivers are speeding, not bothering to obey traffic signals, or stopping for people in crosswalks while others drive safely and obey the laws. No vaccine mandate is the equivalent of having voluntary traffic laws. If you’re concerned about your welfare and the safety of other drivers, you’ll obey the laws. If you’re not concerned, you’ll put your life and the lives of others in jeopardy. But I’m not shedding any tears if the person who flies past me on the interstate is pulled over by police or ends up in a ditch. They made that conscious choice and will have to live with the consequences. So do those who refuse to be vaccinated."
2021-07-27 13:50:39,"Can’t force people, so you’ll need to live with it.

Anger is meaningless."
2021-07-27 14:41:58,"I see quite a few comments asking why the vaccinated are so concerned if they truly consider themselves to be protected. The concern is that this virus is continuing to mutate. The more spread there is, the more chance of it mutating. The next mutation could be immune to the vaccination. That's the concern."
2021-07-27 14:53:06,"I am not so much angry as very, very sad. We have been vaccinated since last February. Because of rising rates of infection in my area, due to the Delta variant and high numbers of people who refuse to get vaccinated, I and my husband are returning to a policy of staying home when possible, wearing masks in public, and not eating inside restaurants. We are concerned about the possibility of breakthrough infections, given our ages (we are both in our mid70s). This is hardly helping our mental health or the economy. People who still refuse to get vaccinated are being selfish and, at this point, irrational. But we have had ample evidence over the past several years that a large proportion of the American people fit this description."
2021-07-27 14:53:08,"I’m as angry as anyone about the willfully unvaccinated, but this idea that insurance companies shouldn’t cover COVID treatment for unvaccinated people is no good. Do we really want to set that precedent with insurance companies? They are already too powerful, too willing to deny coverage to paying customers. 

The solution, at this point, is what France is doing. Require proof of vaccination for everything. Simple, fair, and effective."
2021-07-27 14:52:23,"I have a niece with two infant children and a husband who works in a factory and both refuse to get vaccinated. It's extremely frustrating to the remainder of our family who are fully vaccinated. For me the solution is simple, I will not visit them with my 9 year old daughter until they are vaccinated and they will have to understand that the reason is to lessen the risk of transmission to our children. People need to start playing hardball with their unvaccinated friends and family. Perhaps that will help with some of the hesitancy."
2021-07-27 14:50:44,"In the US some 67% of the vaccine eligible population is vaccinated.  At a rate of 500k/day, in 60 days some 30m additional people will be vaccinated or some 12% of the vaccine eligible population, so that gives us 77%.  Around 11% of the population has had confirmed covid (and more who have had covid, but was not confirmed), so that's another 3%, at a minimum, taking us to 80% of the vaccine-eligible population.

Covid is local, so where there is low vaccinations there will be local outbreaks, but that means in other areas vaccinations are high and there cannot be a generalized outbreak.

As long as the vaccines continue to be effective against variants, there is no mathematical possibility of another general outbreak. Covid is no longer a threat in so much as there will always be sickness and disease."
2021-07-27 14:46:09,"The anger towards the unvaccinated is completely justified. No amount of a resulting backfire to vaccination enforcement should deter the government from meeting the spreaders of a catastrophic second pandemic ON PURPOSE heads on. 
One way to start may be extreme but effective- no vaccination, no hospitalization."
2021-07-27 13:25:32,"We are all aghast and outraged if a drunk driver kills one person, and our legal system reflects that outrage. Yet, one can choose to walk around, laugh, cough and infect hundreds and kill an untold number of people without consequence. All in the name of freedom? 

It bogles the mind that people complain about the health care system, yet sheer stupidity is keeping a deadly virus alive and well across the country. Yes, we are mad."
2021-07-27 13:49:01,"""A tougher stance may backfire, some experts warn.""

It is frankly insane that we have to cater to the feelings of these adult children. Especially given that these are the folks who generally don't give a care in the world about the welfare of those who don't look or think like them.

We are now a country where we have to shape our policies and messaging around not hurting the feelings of the dumbest and most delusional amongst us. Every time I think this country can't get any stupider, I am reminded that yes, yes it can."
2021-07-27 15:00:31,"We need to understand more about breakthrough cases, and publish those findings.  The vaccine is supposed to protect you from serious infection, and according to the data, these 95% should be protected from infection period.  While the variants may provide less protection, it seems there are a lot more breakthrough infections than are predicted by the CDC and NIH who say they are 'rare.'

The CDC also stated, as their criteria that those fully vaccinated don't need to wear masks, that vaccinated people do not shed the virus, i.e. are not 'carriers.'  I mention breakthroughs and shedding as it pertains to one's knowledge and confidence in the vaccine.  

Until fully approved by the FDA, we'll have holdouts.  But to have these holdouts in the healthcare community, where the VA has to mandate vaccines, seems as though information is lacking and it's not just some Republicans, it's clearly across the political spectrum."
2021-07-27 14:41:58,"I am fully vaccinated, my wife is fully vaccinated, our teenage son is fully vaccinated. we got our vaccines but I can't say that I was happy about it or that I did not have serious and rational reservations, especially for our child. there are going to be people who can't or shouldn't, the immune compromised, and there are going to be people who simply don't want it, their reasons may be well reasoned or not."
2021-07-27 14:55:25,"What if health insurance premiums were to go up on those that choose to stay unvaccinated? This is reckless behavior that would end up costing health insurance companies (and society at large) a lot more money, no?"
2021-07-27 15:13:45,"Vaccination should be mandated for everyone without a medical excuse. Every person who chooses NOT to be vaccinated is a threat to our health, to our economy and to our national security!"
2021-07-27 14:41:47,"I think the government forcing vaccinations would not go well. But employers and indoor places of business? Yes, by all means. No mask signs for those already vaccinated quickly turned into no masks for everybody. Why? Because many of the people who don't believe in the virus anyway are not going to comply with a sign. Don't put the rest of us in danger of a possible mutation of the virus that doesn't respond to current vaccines!"
2021-07-27 14:42:20,Glad to see I'm not the only angry vaccinated person. As this situation goes on my anger rises. Just now I see where CDC is advising the vaccinated to wear masks in certain situations. Hold the UNVACCINATED accountable! With hold $$ from their states where numbers rise. People encourage more companies to mandate vaccine and Mr President mandate the military get vaccinated.
2021-07-27 14:49:44,"""Vaccine hesitancy and refusal occur across the political and cultural spectrum in the United States, and for a variety of reasons...Changing minds is often a slow, individualized process.""

OK! The reasons don't matter, and we haven't got time to wait. Vaccine mandates now! No exceptions, except for valid medical reasons."
2021-07-27 15:09:43,"While I understand the fury at the unvaccinated (and lean that way myself), until the developing world reckons with the imperative of ponying up to ensure vaccinations for the entire world population, we will all be facing endless rounds of new variants. There will be no healthcare system left for any of us as providers and support staff are traumatized beyond functioning and leave the field or die off."
2021-07-27 15:09:52,"Without getting into a debate about “the right” to refuse vaccination, it’s a fact that too many folks still have the ability to refuse. I also have the ability to run stop signs or red lights, and a surgeon has the ability to drink alcohol before operating. The ability to do or not do something doesn’t make both ok. To get vaccinated is just showing basic decency as a human being."
2021-07-27 14:49:38,"""Waiting to see if there are long term effects."" There is nothing in the vaccine itself and what is known as causes of, for example, infertility that would lead the medical community to be concerned.

2021-07-27 14:57:28,"The unvaccinated are going to be responsible for more than the resurgence of this pandemic and it’s effects on our lives and economy. The incurable fungus spreading quietly but ruthlessly through our health systems can’t be fought effectively while this pandemic goes on.

We are stuck in a place where individual liberties outrank social responsibilities but we are failing to understand each other.

And the opportunity is right here. The right is using the phrase “my body, my choice.” The left is trying to figure out a way around that."
2021-07-27 15:00:27,"I fail to see why we are being so nice to people who choose to endanger us all by being unvaccinated. It's against the law to drive recklessly, throw heavy objects from heights, or leave weapons where children can reach them. Not being vaccinated creates a breeding ground for a new virus mutations, endangering everyone. Masks alone won't solve that problem. We need to protect everyone, even people who don't think that their behavior will affect others."
2021-07-27 15:01:04,"I believe that people have the right to choose, but if they do not get vaccinated and then come down with covid-19 then they should not be allowed to go to the hospital, instead quarantine at home.  Don't expose hospital doctors and nurses to the risks."
2021-07-27 15:15:54,After fda approval - or even before - can't employers require immunization?
2021-07-27 14:44:07,I wonder whether the vaccine could be sprayed indoors. The Astra Zeneca or J&J ones are cheap and easily scalable.

2021-07-27 15:02:28,This really is not a communication problem it is a sociological problem. This is mostly a protest against authority. If you listen carefully they do not want to be told what to do and when to do it. Now they want to be coddled. They feel hurt by our attempts to make them take it. In short they are acting like a two year old who does not want to take his medicine. So now we are giving out trinkets to try and entice them to do the right thing. We as a nation are paying for not electing true leaders.

2021-07-27 14:41:37,"It seems that those who refuse to get vaccinated are the ones always screaming how government is taking away their FREEDOM. Day after day their politicians pass legislation saying no masks requirements allowed, now go out and party and spend. Well I say now that there are vaccines that can combat the Covid virus then now is the time for the vaccinated to start stating firmly and loudly how these unvaccinated and their politicians are taking away our FREEDOM. Insurance companies should state that they will no longer cover medical bills of those who are unvaccinated if they come down with Covid. Time for us to put the shoe on the other foot. We've done our best to combat this virus. We are the ones that now need to be heeded. Vote all politicians out of office if they are on the wrong side of this issue. They are not for the good of their constituents."
2021-07-27 15:19:40,"I am deeply frustrated, but not angry, with my sweet relatives who steadfastly refuse the vaccine because they honestly (albeit completely irrationally) believe the vaccine is more dangerous than the disease. My anger -- no, not just anger: fury -- is reserved for those government officials and media personalities who have intentionally lied to them, putting their lives and countless other lives at risk for personal profit or political gain. I truly can't fathom how those people sleep at night. Imagine having one life to live and spending it like that."
2021-07-27 14:54:29,It honestly feels a lot like climate change. Whether we take action on the most pressing health crisis- climate change- depends on the interests of specific wealthy corporations who perpetuate disinformation and misinformation for their own benefit. But it's hard not to get angry at the people who believe them because their own actions or inaction actually kill the rest of us.
2021-07-27 15:07:30,"Interestingly the Fed Government has no problem withholding funds for clinics or organizations that perform abortions or distribute information about birth control. They had no difficulty withholding funds for highways in states who wouldn’t mandate a 55 mph speed limit. These steps were purportedly  based upon health and safety concerns. Why is it in a pandemic where there is a proven solution there is no similar concern. “Oh, people might get mad” is not a valid excuse for taking a hard line here. Withholding stimulus checks is an excellent idea, as is denying funds to any recipient who refuses to mandate vaccines. Unvaccinated children should not be allowed to attend school in person. Any govt services including welfare and Medicaid, Medicare and social security should not be provided for those who selfishly refuse to consider the health and safety of their fellow human beings."
2021-07-27 15:10:54,"To attend public school a child needs their basic round of shots because nobody wants polio or measles. When I was growing up I never heard anyone say a rubella shot interfered with their liberty. 

Those of us who got the vaccine right away – led by courageous older Americans – have been guinea pigs for the unvaccinated. They benefit from several months of data and self-reporting from the vaccinated, as well as lower risk of contraction.

Watch American TV and you’re bound to see numerous ads for medicines with rapidfire voiceovers warning that if patients experience “side effects” ranging from dizziness and shortness of breath to suicidal thoughts they should contact their physicians right away. Yet people routinely take these drugs.

All of which means this maelstrom is a direct result of disinformation campaigns.

Now that states and municipalities are creating mask and vaccine mandates, a permanent group of unvaccinated may be left behind by the economy and education system. They may be angry just as bankrupt and impoverished people were angry after the 2007/8 financial crisis. How would we deal with this?"
2021-07-27 14:46:31,"If the health care industries really cared about health and not profits they would be encouraging vaccination and even mandating it. Beyond it being the ethical thing to so, it would also be the cost effective thing to do. But that might alienate their shareholders—some of whom are assuredly anti-vaxxers—so they avoid taking a stand."
2021-07-27 15:02:58,It’s just displaced anger that the vaccines aren’t working as well as people hoped. But big pharma has a long track record of exaggerating the effectiveness of their products.
2021-07-27 15:06:32,"I don't believe in denying anyone health insurance entirely because they refuse to get vaccinated, but unless they have a valid medical excuse, slap them with a high deductible, $5k minimum. Make them ineligible for rent relief, the no-eviction support, extended unemployment and any other benefits related to the pandemic. 

Sorry, but enough is enough. The obstinance/selfishness of the anti-vaxxers is costing lives and placing an unnecessary burden on the healthcare system -- not to mention the vastly overworked and under-rewarded healthcare workers."
2021-07-27 15:18:17,"In our dental practice I ask each new patient whether or not they chose to be vaccinated. If they have I can have our ""get to know you"" chat without my mask. If not, I wear a mask. But I tell they why: it is to protect them. I am fully vaccinated and am not likely to fall ill, much less wind up in the hospital or dead. But the vaccines my wife and I took were not tested to see if they prevented transmission of the virus if we are exposed. 
Most assumed I was doing this to protect me and are surprised when I tell them I am actually protecting them. 
Unfortunately at least half of our new patients have chosen not to be vaccinated. Note I said ""chosen"". I am yet to encounter anyone who was precluded from taking the vaccine due to medical issues.
That is why I am through being tolerate of those who are purposely putting their friends, neighbors and community at risk. There is no other way to explain their actions.
Bring the hammer down on these people. If you are afraid of driving more people into silos at least there will be fewer dead, innocent people. 
After all, would you tolerate this behavior if they were constantly driving a car while impaired?
What is the difference?"
2021-07-27 15:18:32,"These vaccine-hesitant folks keep me wearing a mask at all times in public and are giving me anxiety. Unless you have had a bad reaction to vaccines before, there should be no excuse to not be vaccinated. People are making decisions based on flawed gut feelings instead of actual basic scientific knowledge and it irritates me to no end."
2021-07-27 14:42:04,"I have had enough of the unvaccinated screaming about their freedoms; freedom to not get vaccinated; freedom to refuse to wear masks or have their children wear masks; freedom to infect the rest of us. These are the same people who didn't want the states to shut down or impose mandates. Now, here we are. On the verge of another wave, and still, the screaming about no one can make me get a vaccine. There must be consequences. The unvaccinated need not seek medical care. Hospital workers are exhausted and angry. Stay away from restaurants, theaters, concerts, and don't get on a plane. The rest of us would like our lives back. We, too, have freedoms."
2021-07-27 14:55:28,"The CDC just flopped again and now advice for the fully vaccinated to wear masks again fir indoor public spaces. All scientific evidence shows that vaccination reduces the risk of infection _and_ transmission to very low levels, including for the new variants. Reinstating this mask wearing for the fully vaccinated will not decrease the spread of COVID and will take away another incentive for people to get vaccinated. 
Although it is going to be difficult to get a full vaccination mandate it is possible to make life for the non-vaccers so miserable that they throw in the towel. This is what France, Italy and Ireland are now doing and it seems to work.
And Yes, I'm angry, very angry at people that refuse to get vaccinated for no valid reason and put everyone and the future at risk!"
2021-07-27 14:59:41,Medicare and insurance companies should deny paying for care that the unvaccinated receive for COVID-related illness.
2021-07-27 15:18:11,"My wife, my son and I are fully vaccinated. Why should we suffer at the hands of the unvaccinated and our lives put at risk because of their selfishness. I don’t want to hear any of their nonsense arguments either. If they can’t be forced to take the vaccine, it should be made difficult for them not to do so: losing jobs, benefits, losing access to leisure activities (as in France) and so forth. If these don’t work, draconian measures may be needed. We can’t let these people put others at risk."
2021-07-27 14:47:33,"At this point, the hospitals and insurance companies are the organizations that will be able to force the issue for vaccinations.  

Hospitals should be able to close down new admissions for Covid patients over the age of 18 who are unvaccinated by choice.  Insurance companies need to notify insureds they will not cover Covid related expenses for the unvaccinated who are 100% able to be vaccinated.

I can only hope that once the unvaccinated are having to care for one another at home and see the horrible deaths first hand, the vaccination rates will increase."
2021-07-27 14:51:43,"On July 12, with only 50% of the French population having received at least one shot of vaccine and Covid infections starting to rise again, Emmanuel Macron announced that access to cafes, trains, cinemas, sporting events, any public space admitting more than 50 people at a time would be restricted to individuals holding a Covid Pass.  Everyone knew that the French Parliament would encode this plan.  It was also made clear that while no one was being mandated to receive a vaccine, that if any individual wants to enjoy what society offers then that person must act responsibly toward all members of that society.
By the evening of July 13, within 24 hours, one million more people had registered to receive their first shot.  Most of these were under the age of 35.  Now two weeks later, with the policy approved by the Parliament, over 61% of the French population has received at least one shot.
Of course the far right wing of French politics has protested, they've been actively promoting others to believe that THEIR liberte' has been violated (with no mention of fraternite'), but they are losing the argument.
When it comes down to a hard choice the majority will choose to be part of the community, not just a grumbling, angry outsider.  But getting a society to the point of making that choice takes leadership.  Macron provided it when he made it clear that he ""no longer had patience nor time"" for those who selfishly continued to endanger his nation.  It's time to push here also."
2021-07-27 15:06:03,"“I shouldn’t be judged or forced to make a decision,” Ms. Harris said. “Society will just have to wait for us.”

For too many, the concept of freedom has been used to defend entitled selfishness.  No, society doesn’t have to wait for someone unwilling to process clear health-related guidance.  Ms. Harris needs to live with the consequences of being a potential spreader, including restricted rights of interaction and, yes, even the harsh judgment of people she’s putting at risk."
2021-07-27 14:49:08,"It’s been awhile since I was anywhere near a four or five year old being readied to start public school. But I seem to remember something about the required records including medical certification regarding any number of required vaccinations. Happily, most states seemed to have refused to budge on that. Righty-right talking heads notwithstanding, any number of credible legal scholars say there’s no bar whatsoever to making Covid vaccination mandatory for everyone medically able to receive it, for any activity requiring contact with any other member of the public. Mandate the vaccine and lock down anyone who refuse. We’re all utterly weary of being held hostage by these Typhoid Marys."
2021-07-27 15:11:41,Hospitals and nursing homes who hire unvaccinated people are guilty of criminal negligence. They are knowingly exposing their vulnerable patients to infection.
2021-07-27 15:15:29,"A tougher stand will NOT backfire. Mandatory vaccination at numerous work places, together with conditioning entry to public venues o vaccination are the only way to push those who don't listen to reason."
2021-07-27 14:42:47,"Following the science would have mandated that unvaccinated people don't attend sporting events, concerts, fly, enter/leave the country or any of the other things that would bring them into contact with strangers, yet here we go punish the people who do the right thing.

I don't believe that I have to point out the pattern here.  If you insure your car you have to have uninsured motorist insurance, if you are a responsible gun owners, there are people who want to take you guns from you rather than go after the people who actually use them to commit a crime.

Here in St Louis, the city has re-instated the mask requirement for people indoors, yet you can attend an outdoor concert or Cardinals game coming into contact with thousands of strangers and are not required to wear a mask. Public officials are now telling us that crowd density does not matter if you are outdoors.

Yesterday I was able to work out at the YMCA without  mask because the local YMCA requires a mask unless you are working out. That doesn't even make any sense."
2021-07-27 15:09:12,"I hear many vaccine-hesitant people say that they do not want to take a vaccine that is not FDA approved. While I do not agree with them, fair enough. However, I also think that many of these individuals will not get the vaccine once it is FDA approved and will simply move the goal posts of their argument in order to justify their irrationality to themselves and others. I hope I am wrong and we will see a spike in vaccination rates after full approval, but I will not hold my breath."
2021-07-27 15:15:25,"Listened to The Current on CBC radio today.  Summed up the problem quite nicely.  Lots of really uneducated people out there who have been taken in by the snake oil salesman.  I even have them in my family. Health professionals who thin the vaccine will alter your DNA.  Thankfully they are retired.

Here is my take.  Bring out a vaccine passport.  No one forced to get a vaccine.   No vaccine you can not go to grocery stores, stores of any other kind, bars, hotels, airports, can't renew your drivers license or vote.  

You have the right to not get a vaccine,  society has the right to exclude you from all societal activities.

If your GP will exclude you from the requirement that is okay but the GP needs to know that they will receive a visit from a public health official to check on why they did that and they better have medical records to prove their decision."
2021-07-27 15:20:50,"My beloved uncle was recently murdered by the unvaccinated 
Covid patients who refused to be vaccinated. Their “personal freedom” to not get vaccinated was more important to them than the saving the lives of others. My uncle had the misfortune of living in a state that has an extremely low vaccination rate. Naturally, the hospital was overflowing with unvaccinated Covid patients on ventilators. My elderly uncle, who has had both vaccine shots and was healthy, had a fall at home and went to the hospital for treatment. As a result, he ended up catching Covid while at the hospital. My loving uncle was denied a ventilator …there were none available because of all the unvaccinated people getting  Covid. He died ALONE in his hospital bed. He was a wonderful uncle and did not deserve this."
2021-07-27 14:46:56,"My spouse and I (seniors vaccinated since mid-March) were fortunate to withstand the shutdown unscathed. After many months of following all protocols--including not even to leave our own county--I have no empathy for anti-vaxxers. It is criminal that health care workers in various facilities are holding out (and BTW three friends of ours lost parents to Covid in health care settings). Those members of the public with Covid who think they'll simply check into a hospital for the cure are beyond selfish. 

The only huge university in our city opens for in-person classes next month and is requiring students, faculty, and others to be vaccinated but is allowing religious exemptions. I pray (intentional choice of words) that it will allow few or none."
2021-07-27 15:02:47,"It's beyond time to make the eligible yet unvaccinated pay a price. I'm more than OK with any/all of the following:

1. Raising insurance premiums or requiring COVID vaccination required in order to be eligible for health insurance
2. Vaccination mandates at workplaces, commercial air travel, attending live ticketed events, restaurants/bars/nightclubs

If one's unwilling to get vaccinated and falls ill (or worse) to COVID, I have little/zero sympathy for them. They're menaces to society right now and deserve negative consequences for their reckless irresponsibility."
2021-07-27 15:06:53,"It is a no-brainer that if all were vaccinated, there's no possibility for virus mutation, yet if not, more and more resistant mutations will arise. My family and I are vaccinated, but I am concerned that anyone in my office (where masks are still required because some ore not vaccinated), the supermarket - where most still wear masks- can infect me. While I am in the at-risk population, but otherwise healthy, I may not get that sick - I can pass it to others who may- or pass it to others who have children under 12. While I understand the hesitation of some- it's time to have and enforce a mandate. Children can't go to school or camp without measles, diphtheria and other vaccines - why not this?"
2021-07-27 15:12:21,"What a great umbrella to hide under ""vaccine hesitancy""  rather than what it really is.  Refusal to get the shot because I'm uncertain.  Really, do they think all the vaccinated were 100% certain, that we didnt have doubts.  But we took the vaccine anyway as we understood it was for our own good and the""common good"" of our communities and country."
2021-07-27 15:11:08,I don’t understand what is taking FDA so long to give the vaccines full authorization given the millions of people who have taken the vaccine with no major problems.  It would surely help.  That the vaccine is not fully authorized remains an arguably valid reason for vaccine hesitancy. I’m fully vaccinated months ago.
2021-07-27 10:21:21,Mandate vaccines for Covid not because it will save those who refuse vaccination self imposing a death sentence on themselves but because they may allow Covid to mutate and be able to pierce the thin wall of  the vaccines endangering good vaccinated  Americans who care about their fellow humans.
2021-07-27 11:49:33,"This is war. Yes, the number of people whose lives will be ended or nearly destroyed is above what we as a country have ever experienced.

If you can be vaccinated and have not been, you must be denied the freedom of being able to interact with others, as you will either spread or receive the virus.

There are way too many children running around in adult bodies, who believe that it is their right to harm others based on their rights. Nonsense. It is not their right to cause death and disease to spread."
2021-07-27 12:40:44,"Where is the information on breakthrough infections?
I'm vaccinated and would like to know how many of the daily cases are from the vaccinated."
2021-07-27 11:05:56,"One factual point that this article fails to address is that of the vaccines not preventing either one from contracting the virus of passing it along. That is a serious matter as anyone, regardless of vaccination status, may contract, pass, and enable formation of variants."
2021-07-27 13:32:17,I wonder how many people who are anti-vax and/or unvaccinated still have their pets and livestock vaccinated for contagious diseases
2021-07-27 13:32:41,"I have enjoyed reading Liberal commentators who suggest the unvaccinated should pay more for health insurance.  

I agree with them.

But I also believe the same logic should apply to people who smoke, are obese, and who have failed to maintain continuous health coverage.  Hopefully the Liberals will see the logic in their anger at the unvaccinated and decide it is not such a great idea for the young and the healthy to subsidize the insurance costs of those who do not take care of themselves."
2021-07-27 10:26:41,Dialog and outreach are being done now for months. Now is time for mandates. The rights of the vaccinated count too.
2021-07-27 15:46:14,"It's a peculiar arrogance born from living in an era when many horrible diseases have been eradicated thanks to vaccines. My sister-in-law refuses to be vaccinated because she understands the virus and the vaccines better than infectious disease experts. This disrespect, contempt even, for expertise has been building in this country for many years. It's really come to a head now.

They endanger us all, allowing, even encouraging its spread, willing it to mutate again and again. If they become ill, they endanger everyone they encounter. If they seek care, they endanger every nurse and doctor. Shame on them."
2021-07-27 15:46:14,I would go a little further. Ask anyone not getting vaccinated to sign a waiver agreeing that when they get COVID they do not want to be hospitalized;they will refuse treatment with monoclonal antibodies ( since they’re new and untested); they will not hold healthcare workers (or hospitals) liable should they refuse to be around them and should they be hospitalized without their consent ( they might be unconscious ) and they will personally pay any costs incurred. Of course they will probably not sign the waiver but it might get the point across.
2021-07-27 15:46:14,"I have to confess feeling something beyond anger. I'm feeling contempt. It's no secret that this is real. We've been in a Recession, on the border of revolution, and seen tons of unnecessary dying for over a year. Plenty of people are delusional about innocuous topics, but this has touched every American and a third of us still try to posture like they've somehow got this all figured out.  Not only that, but they expect us to accept that they ""figured it out"" from their bedroom reading some fringe website for 5 minutes, or because epidemiologists like Tucker Carlson said so.

Not only that, we now see that vaccination rates are taking off in precisely the areas where this rejectionism has run rampant the past year. These people spent all last year making the rest of the country drink the Kool Aid by spreading this infection. And now they're Jim Jonesing us by chickening out when it's their turn to get infected. This is what a death cult looks like.

I feel contempt at this point. Most of this country was careful last year, and advocated for us all being even more careful. And now that we have our most powerful tools available, we all have to suborn our desires to get back to normal to indulge these peoples' fantasies, yet again. 

I want these people to get sick, and I hope it hurts."

2021-07-27 15:47:25,"From the story:  “I shouldn’t be judged or forced to make a decision,” Ms. Harris said. “Society will just have to wait for us.” 

To which the answer must be:  NO.   We won't wait for you.   The wailings of the anti-vaxxers are pathetic.   'The vaccine was rushed and there may be long-term effects'.   Nonsense.   These people aren't scientists or doctors so they're unqualified to comment.  They're spouting fear and ignorance.   If it did cause ""long term"" effects, we'd have seen them now, almost 8 months since the vaccines became available.   Moreover, there have never been long term complications from vaccines.   Rushed?   Development was fast because science can make vaccines more efficiently than ever before.  It's called progress.   

The social contract applies.   Anti-vaxxers benefit from good roads, clean water, schools, and all manner of other services provided by society.   Other people, our neighbors, make them possible.  In turn, we owe it to our neighbors to help ensure their safety, just as the fire and police departments ensure ours.   Anti-vaxxers, don't be ungrateful children.  Stop whining about your autonomy, your personal choice, blah, blah.    The only thing anti-vaxxers will respond to is their pocketbook.   Therefore, employees should self-vaccinate or face termination.   Government benefits should be suspended until proof of vaccination is produced.   Exceptions made for the immunocompromised and people unable to tolerate it.   That's it."
2021-07-27 15:47:39,"""... experts warn that punitive measures and social ostracism can backfire, shutting down dialogue and outreach efforts.""

Dialogue and outreach have gone on for the past 7 months and the result is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Dialogue and out reach have obviously not worked, so why worry about shutting them down? 

Adult Jehova Witnesses are free to choose death rather than a blood transfusion, so extending that courtesy to the unvaccinated, rather than enforcing a vaccination mandate, might seem reasonable. However the freedom to remain unvaccinated creates a breeding ground for new variants that could endanger us all and we all pay the enormous and needless medical costs when the unvaccinated get covid. 

Almost everyone would agree that freedom has its limits. The freedom to remain unvaccinated seems to me rather like the freedom to shout ""Fire!"" in a crowded threatre.

Smarten up America and get vaccinated. Your choice to prefer death and remain unvaccinated affects those who need and love you when you succumb to covid."

2021-07-27 15:49:48,"The imagined badge of honor these vaccine-refusing people sport is actually a badge of self delusion and may I add, self indulgent stupidity.  And they pose a clear and present danger.  As of the first of August, unvaccinated patients are no longer welcome in my medical practice and will be terminated as patients.  We’ve risked our own lives and the lives of my responsible patients long enough.  Vaccine is safe, effective, free, and available almost everywhere on demand.  Oh and FDA - get your rear ends in gear, get off your vacation boats, and approve those vaccines.  NOW!"
2021-07-27 15:29:46,"Unless one can demonstrate a valid medical reason for refusing the vaccine (a doctor’s note), then one should be compelled to do so.  Unvaccinated individuals who have refused a vaccine should simply be warehoused outside of hospitals.  Medical personal and other resources should not be wasted on those who are fatally selfish.  Let them be tended by unvaccinated volunteers who, I’m sure, would be happy and proud to care for people who are just like them - stubborn, stupid and criminally ignorant."
2021-07-27 15:44:26,"Elif Akcali shouldn't be surprised that people put their right to refuse a vaccine ahead of the lives of others.

We long ago decided that the right to own and carry guns as more important that other people's right to live.

And of course we know that if you get vaccinated your guns will be taken away.  At least that's what the Republican Party and its right wing media toadies have told me"
2021-07-27 15:18:37,"Anger is not what I'm feeling. Disgust is more like it. Fully vaccinated here, still wearing mask to shop, etc. No problem. I suppose that it's useless for me to feel disgusted by stupidity, which is always with us, but anger is self-destructive and I won't let that happen. If the unvaccinated get sick and die, it's Schadenfreude time for me. It helps to mitigate the disgust."
2021-07-27 15:08:37,“Society will just have to wait for us”. And there you have it. Two things to consider. The virus LOVES the vaccine hesitant. Believe what you want. The virus does not care.

2021-07-27 12:28:03,"Yes, the idea that some people are unvaccinated makes me angry. They endanger others, including and especially health care workers who save their lives. I think private enterprise ought to make vaccination a requirement for employment, that businesses should refuse to serve the unvaccinated, that people who are not vaccinated should pay higher health care premiums and that when the unvaccinated turn up in hospitals with Covid they should go to the end of the line. We're talking about our lives here, not to mention the pleasures of day-to-day existence, our ability to travel and our economy. And I'm not going to stop being angry because it's counter-productive. Nobody is more counter-productive than the hypocritical conservatives who are tearing apart this country and now literally trying to kill us."
2021-07-27 14:10:34,"The vast majority of people commenting here probably have never looked at the CDC data on who is actually dying from COVID. I have. The elderly and those with co-morbidities (other diseases) make up the vast majority. 70% are obese. The risk to those under 50 and healthy is low. For those under 18 (without other health complications) it is essentially zero. The WHO explicitly recommended against vaccinating those under 18. There are also links to low vitamin D. THAT IS THE DATA. THE SCIENCE.

The risk to most people has been vastly overstated. And the risk from the vaccines due to adverse reactions is under-reported and the long-term consequences is unknown. The vaccines are experimental. You are the guinea pigs.

You don't have to think Bill Gates is injecting nano-chips into you as a diabolical plan for population control to have reservations. I think it is quite rational to do a simple cost benefit calculation and decide that you would rather wait and see."
2021-07-27 10:27:31,"Make it a requirement for insurance coverage and it will no longer be an issue. Medicare, Medicaid, ACA, private insurance, all should be requiring vaccines unless there is a VALID medical reason, not just hesitancy. I had to get a polio shot to go to kindergarten. My dog is required to get rabies shots. C'mon."

Mandatory vaccine will not work, because some people are more sensible to side effect and will find a way to escape this punishment.

There's alrealdy enough vaccinated people to derail the virus, the number of people killed by the Covid doesn't increase even when the number of new case is rising.

all you have to do is to give people choice between different options and let decide which one is best for them.

If you want to punish somebody, then punish those who are spreading fake news about the virus, it's the only category who deserve it. Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of propaganda."

This ""I'm all right Jack"" disregard for society as a whole has been burrowing deeper into the Republican mindset for decades.

Like losers after a big football game, they may have lost on the field, but they will ""win"" in other ways in other places. ""Try and stop us!""

Our national ""stand-off"" has become, and is, insane: citizens refusing medical protection because they see it as an infringement on their freedom.

We've got a long way to go to find our way back to sanity. Worse, we don't seem to be making any progress; I never thought our civic life could reach such a low point. I believed that we were much better than this: surprise! We're not.

Once a society gets off-track, it takes a huge lift to get it back on, a huge lift that rarely comes, if my reading and understanding of history is valid.

We're in a bad place nationally, yet all we can do is try to pick up the pieces, repair the damage, and move forward. Being pessimistic or optimistic is largely irrelevant; the hard work must be done, so the sooner we start, the sooner we will see improvement.

2021-07-27 15:00:53,"This is 100% on the right-wing media, internet trolls of unknown origin (although I have my suspicions), and on the anti-vaxxer cults.

I have noticed that whenever a local (Minnesota) news page on Facebook posts something about precautions against COVID-19, it is flooded with snide comments from posters who either live out of state or whose place of residence cannot be determined.

I answered one of them in Russian a few months ago, and he clearly understood, although he responded in English.

However, it is those who make accusations of trollery whom Facebook reprimands, not the actual trolls.

I have two high school classmates--whom I remember as nice people but not all that bright--who are convinced that Ivermectin (a veterinary deworming medication) will cure them if they contract COVID-19.

I like the approach that some European countries are taking. You can choose to be unvaccinated, you can believe any stupid theory you want, but you lose the right to enter restaurants, theaters, sporting events, and other venues where large numbers of people congregated.

Yes, a vaccine passport. The first time I traveled overseas at age 17, I had to carry proof of a smallpox vaccination, and the form also showed that I had had a recent DPT vaccination. So what's the big deal about needing proof of a COVID-19 vaccination?"
2021-07-27 15:11:40,"I don't understand how we got here.  I blame the misinformation campaigns of the previous administration and social media memes pushing, again false information.  Are vaccines perfect?  No.  Have they saved millions of lives?  Yes.  I guarantee with Polio you wouldn't have reservations, you would immediately get vaccinated because it was a miracle.  This notion that ""99% survival rate"" is being pushed completely ignores the long haul issues that haven't been identified yet while we have identified organ damage, brain trauma etc.  Isn't that enough to wake up?"

But suppose we do not force anything, and we also do not wait for the laggards to catch up.  Suppose we just stop waiting and move ahead and cut off all government subsidized health insurance and free public health services to adults whose behavior is increasing everybody’s risk, without any good excuse?  Just as your insurance carrier would non-renew your home policy if you insisted on building an open fire in the kitchen.

It is creepy to me that I recently have found myself walking around thinking ""who around me is lying, pretending to be vaccinated when clearly not everyone is?""  People make up all kinds of excuses to not get the vaccine, but walking around without the vaccine and without a mask is not making up an excuse, it is just a bold lie walking around in plain sight hidden among the vaccinated.   They know it while they do it too.  This is what angers me.

I recall when my in-laws got their vaccines they were excited and even proud that they could go out in public without masks on.  They had been cautioned not too by their doctor but were thinking about it anyway.  I cautioned them that by going out without masks so early they would be emboldening others who are NOT vaccinated to also go without masks knowing that people would just assume they too were vaccinated.  Well, here we are now living in that reality.  This was predictable.  We should have required everyone wear masks until we hit 90% vaccinated.  But oh how people would have rioted if we had done the reasonable and prudent thing.  Maybe it is time for the vaccinated to rise up and make some noise."

When things quieted down and I could get my jabs in the drug store my husband and I went and got them. I am surprised more than angry that a sizable number of people do not want the shots that already are showing results. But I am reminded that I was among the reluctant and it would be wrong to adopt a ”holier than thou” attitude toward other foot draggers. I like that finally there are some mandates being placed on some employees and civil servants as far as that can be done. The human animal is a stubborn beast and we have seen how that can be used by the deniers and manipulators. Even the hypocrites who have HAD the shot and still will not make it mandatory. I do not remember anything like this with earlier vaccines. I would like to blame the ”former guy” and his minions but it goes beyond politics. A call to a higher purpose is in order.

The most covid cases in a day in a county of 450'000 has been 6 and most days it has been only one or two in the month of july , the hospital has 2 covid cases . But the hospital is crammed full , larger rooms are divided by plastic and become rooms for 4 , 6 0r more . Temporary ducting is everywhere , input and output and patients are moved on a regular basis to where the equipment is , i was in 6 rooms in 6 days .The wave of patients now is those who had  surgery delayed because of covid cases and more recently of people who were scared to go near a hospital to seek help . This is Canada and we are reducing cases faster than the US because we are now vaccinating more people and continue to do so . So smarten up and get vaccinated before the US is hit with the wave of non covid patients filling your hospitals , give the people who have been waiting for months a chance to be taken care of ."

Even in our own homes, we can't blare loud music at 2 a.m., build a second story without a permit, or burn trash in the back yard.

From the time we wake up until we go to sleep, we have regulations on our personal choices, because we recognize those choices affect others.  

There is nothing exceptional about the people making the choice to remain unvaccinated.  This world is going to face some serious challenges from climate change.  How wise is it to let defiant, small-minded people dictate everyone else's safety?"
2021-07-27 14:19:56,"Does one have a right not to get vaccinated? They certainly do. However, they also must abide by the social contract that exists and keeps society running smoothly ( well usually).

One has a right to drive a car but not at 120 mph or under the influence of drugs as that endangers others.  One has the right of free speech but cannot yell ""Fire"", in a crowded theater or advocate the harm of others. Yes  we all have rights but as a society we also place limitations on those rights for the good of society as a whole. Our most basic rights are those  of  "" Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. "" Notice that Life comes before all others. Those refusing to be part of the social contract and get vaccinated are putting that most precious right at risk, both for themselves and others. That is not acceptable
Perhaps we should follow the lead of both France and soon England, by implementing vaccine passports. Only those who can show proof of vaccination will be permitted to enter many activities such as indoor dining, theater, concerts, museums etc. One could still exercise their right not to be vaccinated but would not be permitted  to force the associated risk of breakthrough infections on others. As French President Macron said of those not willing to protect themselves and others from sickness and possible death "" It's time that they start staying home and not us"". Indeed."
2021-07-27 14:43:02,"I don’t see why mandates or tax penalties are so difficult. This isn’t about personal choice or freedom. These so-called choices put other people’s lives at risk. It’s comparable to laws about drunk driving. They exist to protect everyone from your irresponsible behavior, not necessarily to protect you. (Although the vaccine would do that). We wouldn’t be ok with allowing drunk drivers, it’s not about freedom, and getting this vaccine should be viewed and enforced the same way."
2021-07-27 15:19:43,"Forget about the uninformed and misinformed. They will not be convinced. This is evolution in action. Dump money into developing a booster shot. Wear masks when you're in public. If you operate a private business or have the opportunity to host an event of any sort, exclude the unvaccinated, or have them tune in by Zoom. Finally, lower expectations. Sure, it's possible to end the pandemic by the start of fall, but it's not realistic. Humans value life differently. Not many are outright murderers, but many just don't care about others, or themselves. Our progress will always be slower than possible, because of them."
2021-07-27 15:24:09,"As a physician, father, and grandfather of two with a third on the way, this situation outrages me. In the privacy of home or vehicle, I rant that those refusing vaccine are murderers. I know this is extreme but there is a point here. THEY place us at risk AND we then have to pay for them when they get sick. Every time a non vaccinated person is hospitalized that costs the health system tens of thousands of dollars. Those costs come back to us as rising health insurance premiums. Outrageous. 

I was an HIV doc in the darkest days of that plague. To knowingly and secretly (no disclosure) transmit HIV was considered a crime. Those who refuse to vaccinate are committing the same crime, but far worse since they are potentially infecting dozens to hundreds at a time. 

We mandate car insurance, seat belts, drunk driving laws, no smoking laws, all to protect the individual AND THE PUBLIC. As has been said before, this is a social contract. 
It's time those refusing to get vaccinated be held accountable. We need mandates and regulations. 

Insurance companies should require proof of vaccination and if not forth coming, premiums should be immediately raised. Employers should be allowed to require proof before hiring and mandate vaccination for current employees. No vax, no job. 

Let's not be tripped up by the ""individual liberty and freedom of choice"" buzz words.  We cannot allow ourselves to be held hostage by anti-vaxxers. Their selfish decisions are threatening us all."

And we were ALL symptomatic - fevers, headaches, disorientation, vomiting… the list goes on. We have spent the last year and a half doing everything right - we never stopped wearing masks, we never ate inside a restaurant, we shopped for everything online and via curbside pick-ups.

2021-07-27 15:28:03,"The major reason people still refuse take vaccine is toxic right wing propaganda. I have heard dozens and dozens of arguments against vaccination and ALL arguments against were just mindless repetition of Fox, RWR or other conservative lines, verbatim.

Around 35% of America is sitting in their right wing cocoon and WILL NOT admit they are wrong. I they did, they fear they may be wrong on other issues as well, because their arguments come from the same sources.  Because there are millions of them, they still take their comfort in numbers."
2021-07-27 15:38:43,Early in this pandemic there were state and federal prosecutors who stated they would charge people who intentionally acted in such a way as to put another at risk of infection. This should apply to those who refuse to vaccinate as well.

I'm not interested in dialogue and outreach. I'm interested in doing whatever it takes to get this pandemic behind us.  Vaccine mandates, whether politically difficult or not, are an effective way to get shots in people's arms.  It's time to institute vaccine mandates."
2021-07-27 15:43:20,"I initially chalked up the repeated failures to follow the science as incompetence, but I am beginning to wonder if stirring anger is not the main goal anymore. Whether it is the events of January 6th, Covid, or crime, democrats and the media have not been shy about painting everything as either a conspiracy, racism, or some other category that is designed to create anger in a segment of the population, who otherwise might be asking questions about border security or fiscal policy.

Why am I being asked to wear a mask again when I am vaccinated, yet the Muny, our local theater is allowed to re-open to thousands of densely packed attendees without masks, or proof of vaccination because it is outside?

Why are people trying to prevent me from legally owning a weapon instead of going after and putting violent offenders in jail?

Why am I licensing and buying ""no fault"" insurance for my vehicles when an estimated 1 in 5 vehicles don't bother to get a license or carry insurance?

Why should I as a landlord be expected to front free housing for someone, just because?

I believe that the anger we are seeing is understandable, the real question is why our politicians are being allowed to avoid doing the right things."
2021-07-27 15:23:23,"I strongly disagree with the way this headline is framed and think that it's counterproductive to reinforce this us (vaccinated, morally righteous) vs. them (unvaccinated, selfish) divide. I am vaccinated, but I have spoken to a number of people who are reluctant to get vaccinated for a number of reasons. They have a pre-existing autoimmune disease, they are fearful of the side effects, and/or they are distrustful of the government or pharmaceutical industry. There are a lot of unvaccinated people who are on the fence, and my role as a friend, colleague, and family member is to keep on listening and talking to them and be living proof that the benefits of being vaccinated outweigh the risks. I wish this article didn't bury the lede: one-on-one conversations between the unvaccinated and someone they trust (like Ms. Denton & her doctor) can help us get closer to herd immunity."
2021-07-27 15:23:29,"This didn’t have to be.

2021-07-27 15:30:36,"Any ""sticks"" should be reserved for those who have no medical conditions or negative reactions to shot #1 that would explain their vaccine hesitancy. However, I still think carrots are the better way to go. The president ought to be talking with Fox News and the hate radio stations, and he ought to push a bill to prevent 24-hour ""news"" outlets from being owned by non-Americans. Lotteries for anyone who is vaccinated, including those vaccinated early, are a fair incentive. 
Education matters--we should focus on that. Too many people who are hesitant can't even explain how an mRNA vaccine works and why it would cause the problems they think it will cause."
2021-07-27 15:31:06,"At this point, those unvaccinated are taking a calculated risk. Don’t fault them for it, nor adjust behavior to account for them. Time to get back to individual liberty and responsibility - vaccinated and unvaccinated alike."
2021-07-27 15:34:26,"There is enough anger to go around. I am definitely angry with the non-vaccinated who think that they are entitled to assert some kind of personal right, unless there is a compelling medical reason to avoid the vaccine. I wonder how many people would be in iron lungs if this sort of ""thinking"" had been prevalent when the polio immunizations took place.
But I am also frustrated with the FDA who still have not given formal approval to the vaccines, leaving them experimental or emergency, which is an excuse for some vaccine-hesitant and could be a barrier to any sort of mandatory vaccination program. And I'm also frustrated with the CDC who refuse to investigate or track ""break-through"" cases or cases of those who test positive after being vaccinated. And don't get me started on my Governor..."
2021-07-27 15:42:20,"If some people want to remain hesitant about getting a vaccination, they should then be at least respectful of others by wearing a mask in indoor public spaces, yet all levels of government need to mandate and enforce these mandates.

The virus will not ""wait"", and neither will society."
2021-07-27 15:28:46,"I read an idea whereby anyone who doesn’t get the vaccine renders his or her health insurance null and void.   I think this is an excellent idea.   Hey, it doesn’t interfere with a person’s right to make a choice about what is right for them as an individual, does it?"
2021-07-27 15:30:07,"This is a natural reaction, but one that we should reject.  Anger should be directed at those who spread the lies and misinformation, not the victims who receive it.  Sympathy for the victim is more likely to be effective in actually changing their behavior than hostility.

In a constitutional republic, the citizens have the obligation not only to promote and live virtuous lives of  liberty and freedom but also to share in the responsibility that comes with those core principles. Freedom and liberty are hollow without responsibility: it turns simply into anarchy and decay."
2021-07-27 15:32:30,"When I was in elementary school no one questioned taking the polio vaccine which was a sugar cube, we simply took it with out question, which makes me wonder what has happened to a society that ignores science at their own peril. I'm vaccinated as is my son but we still wear masks indoors in public places. If people choose to ignore the warnings and risk exposure so be it but it is uncaring to those they can expose to the rapidly mutating virus which may become immune to vaccinations."
2021-07-27 15:33:23,"Everyone will become immune to COVID eventually - either by getting the vaccine or getting the disease. But if you choose to get the disease as the unvaccinated are effectively doing, you (1) roll the dice on hospitalization and death and (2) put everyone at significantly more risk than if you were vaccinated. 
For all the arguments about having good reasons to not be vaccinated, the above two points remain."
2021-07-27 15:27:25,"The time has ended for people who refuse to get vaccinated -- other than for medical reasons.  Short of forcing them to get vaccinated, they should be prevented from boarding buses, trains, and airplanes; prevented from attending sporting events, cultural and music events, and other public activities; denied entry to stores and restaurants.  Insurance companies should be given the regulatory go-ahead to raise their health insurance rates substantially.

If people continue to endanger society, they need to pay a steep price in their ability to participate in society. Period."

They need to know a few things, though. First, Trump and his family are fully vaccinated. Second, face masks do not protect them from others with the virus. Rather, the face mask protects the vaccinated from them. Third, Covid is a bad infection that has led to the death of six hundred thousand Americans already and has disabled hundreds of thousands more. Fourth, their anti-vaccine gurus on Fox and other similar stations and the conspiracy theorists on social media are all 100 percent wrong. The vaccine works, it prevents severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. It will also end the pandemic once a sufficient number of people are immunized. As it is, we just have to wait for the antis to die of the disease …… and they will ….. before we can be rid of this scourge. Fifth, even those who refused the vaccine when they were well beg for it once they see the respirator coming. But by then it’s too late and their lives, even if they survive, will never be the same. So they can try to out-tough and out- last the virus, but in the end that little round multi-pronged devil will get them. If only they were smart enough to understand it."

Akcali is correct.  Since when did the rights of misguided people, whose position cannot be supported by science in any way, get to dictate to the rest of us the lie that they cannot be forced to be vaccinated. These selfish folks believe that their rights are superior to everyone else.
They are absolutely wrong. Their rights are not superior to mine, and in fact, since they present a mortal danger to so many, they have chosen to put themselves in a group that should be regulated and not treated with kid gloves. It's time to put pressure on stores. restaurants, and other public places, to only admit those individuals who can show that they have been vaccinated. I have no more sympathy for these folks, and their refusal is putting me and everyone else at risk. Infantile behavior and recklessness should not be looked upon as an individual right.  Never."
2021-07-27 15:57:16,"“If we’re respecting the rights and liberties of the unvaccinated, what’s happening to the rights and liberties of the vaccinated?”

This country protects individualistic/libertarian  “freedom to” rather than “freedom from”, which requires a social conscience. This is the root of many of our problems: many do not believe in or are ignorant of the concept the public good."
2021-07-27 16:15:35,"I have a coworker who contracted COVID. She missed 6 weeks of work and has long-haul issues. This was prevaccine. She used her mask. A relative of hers died from COVID.

2021-07-27 16:21:09,"My mother's approach to child rearing used ""natural consequences"" as discipline: a child who drew on a wall with crayon had to help clean it off, a (neighboring) teen who set a fire that damaged some siding had to work with my mother to repair it.  You broke it, you had to help fix it, and in the process you learned how much harder fixing is than breaking.  It was understandable even to a child and it was predictable--""fair"" and predictable are key.

A similar approach might work for vaccines: tie masking/quarantine/lockdown in each county to its hospitalization rate vs. vaccination rate with an explicit formula.  ""If hospitalization rates increase to X per 100,000 population or Y% of hospital capacity, restrictions will be re-imposed until the rate falls or Z% of the eligible population is vaccinated.""  

This makes the connection between the consequences --sick people in hospitals!--and prevention obvious, and it makes the ""punishment"" for not getting vaccinated be the natural result, going back to pre-vaccine restrictions.  Plus it gives a *community* incentive for vaccination--positive peer pressure, in other words.

I chose hospitalization because ""positive test results"" are easy to dismiss (and game!) while death rates lag infections too long."

2021-07-27 15:23:24,The unvaccinated are holding us back and threatening the lives of children and the immunocompromised…yes we have a right to be angry. I’m angry that because of them this summer is a bust. We are cancelling plane tickets to see family because We do not want to be in an enclosed space with possible Delta variant carriers. The unvaccinated are helping the virus mutate so I expect the virus will be a lot worse and I expect a lot more breakthrough infections. GET VACCINATED!!!
2021-07-27 15:57:52,"I don't often praise a Republican pol, but AL Gov Kay Ivey's quoted comment has it just right.  I also like the Utah nurse's comment for meaning in this moment: “If you choose not to be part of the solution, then you should be accountable for the consequences.”  As this article makes clear, those consequences lie beyond the unvaxed getting infected, severely sick, dying; they involve infecting vulnerable people close to the vaxed, if not the vaxed themselves, and who says they aren't close to a vulnerable person?

Responsible citizens among us (ie, the vaxed) don't really confront those succumbing to the temptation to be irresponsible on the vaccine, confront them publicly with the responsibility that we expect of them.  This is partly a failure of political leadership. Dems know better, tho they rarely voice the truth that distinguishes them from their morally and intellectually corrupt opponents, and ReTrumplicans should know better and would if they weren't so corrupt.

Individual rights not to take the vax must be balanced with communal common good rights to be free of this pandemic.  Freedom of individual choice must be balanced with freedom from disease, surely the more important liberty in this case."
2021-07-27 16:02:03,"I, too, feel a bit of anger, but it's directed at my doctor and the medical-industrial complex as a whole.

On Monday I asked her about getting an mRNA shot before Delta swallows Germany whole. I'm already vaccinated with Johnson&Johnson, but that has only 66% efficiency against Delta.

My doctor told me that she doesn't want to do it. There is a recommendation to have 6 month between the J&J and the mRNA shot, so I should come back in October.

Well... By October I might be dead!

There is enough mRNA vaccine available in Germany, so I'm not stealing from anybody. We even have a slump in vaccinations, so doctors offices are close to normal again. BTW: It was quite frantic at the end of May when I got my first shot, people forming a queue without actually not being allowed to form a queue, so there was a lot of ""...are you in front or behind me?..."" shouting across the parking lot we all milled around in...

And now here comes me, myself and I and actually WANT to be fully (!) protected, not just for me but also - as always - to protect others and keep the hospitalization rate low. But nooooo, we can't do that, because of some ""recommendation""! The Brits are doing it, the U.S. is doing it, but not Germany, no sir!

The preponderance of commentary here seems to be in favorite of mandates with respect to the vaccine, in the name of ""civic duty"" and protecting children and other vulnerable members of society.  If the population really wants to go down that rabbit hole, are people prepared to give up their big, gas-guzzling, polluting SUVs by mandate?  Stop using airplanes, or getting goods from overseas via highly polluting container ships?  Prepared to reduce water usage, perhaps 1 shower a week?  Use electricity only 8 hours/day?  Stop eating chemically treated crops, or meat raised on factory farms? How about terminating any pregnancy by mandate if you already have 2 children?  Opening your neighborhood to housing for the poor and homeless ?  Why, these are all in the name of ""civic duty,"" are they not?  They would all contribute to the well-being of our children in the long term.

It is because of these people that more variants of Covid are developing which in turn will cost all Americans in lost lives, permanently disabled people, and losses financially. Let's be honest, these folks are angry their chosen one lost in a fair election, and have decided to force their scorched earth ignorance onto the rest of the country. This must be corrected by putting the financial costs back onto them."

Since, I have received two Moderna shots and it was a mental relief.  I do not understand not receiving the vaccines and yet, I have relatives who refuse to get them.

At this point, I have lost all sympathy for any unvaccinated who get Covid.  The Delta virus is out there hunting us and they are screaming ""Here I am!"".  Worse than that, if they do get Covid, it increases my chances of being a ""Breakthrough"" victim.

You are legally allowed to get drunk, but not to endanger others by driving a car while drunk. Your are allowed to smoke but in affects your health insurance. It should be the same with the vaccine. No vaccine, no flights, no buses, no concerts, no restaurants, no meeting in groups large than 10 in public places. Health insurance premiums reflect the additional risk you take on by not being vaccinated.

The government should pass a law barring insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid from paying for the cost of medical care provided to people who get Covid and who were not vaccinated, excepting people with a valid medical reason for not getting the vaccine.

Stay at home until the pandemic ends, or you need a mandated vaccination. 

We are past worrying about mask mandates inconsistently followed.

Your rights to be irresponsible end when you put the life of children, adolescents, and the community at large at risk.

It is critical to underscore that it is largely the same unvaccinated people who refused to wear a mask to stop the virus spread, so this has little to do with concern about remote vaccine side effects.

Vaccination must be universally mandated if you want to fly, take public transit, go to school, attend a public stadium or event, restaurant or other public accommodation, work in a public office space, or leave your home during the duration of the global pandemic.

That is the only way to stop this global pandemic from continuing to evolve into the enduring pandemic.

First, there are people who cannot access the vaccine. There are many causes for this: employers who will not give time off to get vaccinated, lack of public transportation, lack of language skills to understand the complexity of vaccine science. These are structural barriers that can and should be overcome with an organized, serious effort by the federal government. With all due speed.

Second, there are people who have ideological, propagandist reasons for not getting the vaccine. Yes, they are being selfish. But they are still human beings who deserve not to suffer. They cannot, must not, not EVER be deprived of human rights. Healthcare, stimulus payments, food assistance--everything the left fights for routinely--should be given freely and without judgment. Want to encourage vaccination? Restrict *privileges*. No bars, no restaurants, no sports events, no concerts, no travel, no hairstylists, no malls, no festivals, no parties, no fraternities, no sororities, no theme parks. 

If you're thinking about political fallout: trade vaccine ""passports"" for voter i.d. Everyone is required to get both. (Then perhaps we could pass some Voting Rights legislation). Then make a federal program to create the hundreds of thousands of jobs needed to create and enforce use of the documentation."

If Japan is only at 27%  vaccinated and they are prepared for disaster, technically advanced, and the most socially considerate country in the world, then this pandemic is  a challenge far greater than I appreciated.

My comment to the world is  everyone who practices social media should affirm their vaccination status and what it means.   If misinformation rules, time to  take back the day.   Social media has not lived up to its promise because we have not lived up to its promise."
2021-07-27 15:52:14,"The Iowa Legislature, in a special session, is considering making it against the law in Iowa for ANY employer to mandate that their employees get vaccinated.  I wouldn't travel to Iowa if that law passes since our vaccination rate now is only 46%."
2021-07-27 15:56:19,"My county has a vaccination rate of 36%. 

Nearly no one is wearing masks--and that includes those visiting my doctor and dentist, which caused me to walk out on both of them.

Visited a hardware store last week: nearly no one was masked, not even the employees (perhaps 5% had masks, if that). I walked back out.

I am fortunate to be retired, which allows me to remain at home for going on years now. I am also fortunate to be an introvert, so this limitation has not impacted my mental health.

BUT, I would like to safely visit a doctor and dentist, and I would like to obtain better food than I can make for myself, and I would like to be able to browse in stores safely.

Multiply the limitations that I've rationally placed upon myself for safety reasons across the population and it is obvious that cautious people are impacting the economy--I know I've spent a LOT less since my self-imposed lockdown began. 

Unvaccinated people are harming the economy as well as harming the citizenry, and all who refuse to mask when in public are doing the same. This is obvious antisocial behavior, but I am supposed to ""respect"" them? 

I think not. 

I have reached the end of my patience with anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers, and I can only hope that they be forced to pay for their own care when they get admitted to the Covid wards. It's the only hope I have left, in terms of anything stemming the tidal wave of Covid cases coming our way.

Enough already!"

What about people who have already had the virus (over 10% of the population) and have developed antibodies naturally?

This is just as good as having the vaccination, and many scientists think it is even better, as you have been exposed to the whole virus.

A positive antibody test should count as much as having the vaccination."

Possibly, but probably not that much greater any other vaccine. Though the one long term effect with covid you'll get that you won't get from the vaccine is death.

There should be penal costs in place unvaccinated. Smokers pay higher insurance premiums. Why not the unvaxxed too? Maybe add medicare to that list too. The idea that its their personal choice when society has to pick up the tab  for expensive medical costs that could have been avoided is unfair. They want to make the choice, and roll the dice, they can pay for their decision financially and otherwise."
2021-07-27 16:12:31,"The voter is not always right. Sometimes national leadership must actively challenge its citizens and exhort them to a more unified cooperative stance than generally presents in normal times. When FDR explained the banking crisis in common sense terms during his first Fireside Chat, he gently chastised the public when he criticized money hoarding as ""an exceedingly unfashionable pastime"". But FDR did not simply criticize or act unitarily. In his first inaugural address, he explained how national unity is an essential precondition for effective leadership that would move the country away from hardship and toward prosperity again. He humbly asked the public to trust him and to give, by acclamation, permission to act for their best interests. Implicit in FDR's early policy thinking was the clear and certain knowledge that ordinary citizens are as much a part of the problem as they are a part of the solution. Politically perilous as it may seem for Joe Biden, gently chiding voters for vaccine hesitancy while allaying their fears is crucially necessary to bring us closer to normalcy once again."

In some states, I am even required to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term - a highly invasive and much more dangerous proposition than a vaccine. I think it's perfectly reasonable for businesses and organizations to require vaccines. I think it's reasonable for insurance companies to deny coverage for Covid to the unvaccinated."
2021-07-27 16:16:14,"First of all, we were required to provide proof of vaccination for Polio, Measles, etc. before we could attend school. Same for obtaining a passport. So it is hard to comprehend that vaccine requirements are a political issue today. But I understand people today are too often engulfed in social media conspiracy theories or have otherwise embraced a rational for justifying a false reality.

I agree with the nurse quoted in this story that insurance companies should deny coverage to those who refuse the vaccine without medical cause. Vaccination of health care workers should also be a no-brainer. 

In fact, I would go further and suggest that hospitals refuse to accept unvaccinated Covid patients who do not have a bona fide medical reason for not getting vaccinated. They seriously jeopardize the health and safety of anyone else who provides or needs medical care. 

We also need to mandate vaccine requirements for schools and public transit once final vaccine approval occurs. I never felt infringed upon when I was a kid attending school. In fact I felt grateful that the vaccines were available. We saw first hand the effects of Polio and clearly understood what we were up against. 

Perhaps ""experts"" today should focus their efforts on educating people what it is like to be seriously ill with Covid. A few short ""here's what can happen to you"" videos distributed via multiple sources, including the media, might go a long way very quickly."
2021-07-27 16:18:26,"The part about a tougher stance backfiring really creates a false narrative. Tougher stance from whom? Since when are vaccine mandates considered a tough stance? Vaccines have to be up to date to attend grade school, college, and to visit certain countries. My brother is a physician and every year must provide proof of having received the flu vaccine if he wants to retain surgical privileges at his hospital. Flu kills less people per year than COVID. Or is the author providing recommendations for how individuals should react to other individuals who are refusing to get vaccinated? Whatever the case with this article, I am so grateful that more places are issuing vaccine mandates. A lot of the people who aren't getting vaccinated because of their beliefs in their freedoms, don't seem to understand that you can't reason with a virus, quote Tucker Carlson or conservative ideals to it. Once it's in a person's body it decides what it's going to do and if you're lucky you're OK. And please no comments about vitamin D and pre-existing conditions or 99 percent recovery."

And I will repeat myself: 100% no-contact with other human beings. Otherwise you are infringing on another human beings right to stay healthy.

My son, who is vaccinated, is a mental health counselor and 85% of his patients are unvaccinated and do not wear masks during their hour long sessions in a small room with a closed door.  He wants to visit me in September.  I told him that with the Delta variant having such a high breakthrough level, he would have to mask for two weeks before coming.  He told me he was not going to live in fear.  I told him he wasn't going to visit and, potentially, expose me to the virus.  Some members of my family think I am paranoid about this but this virus has a horrible death and long term morbidity pattern.  I don't try to reason with them, it doesn't work.  I just told them that decisions have consequences and not seeing me is the price they have to pay for their decision just as me not seeing them is the price I pay for requiring vaccination."

*Of course* governments have a duty to protect public health. *Of course* that's a stronger imperative than some yahoo's insane belief that vaccine mandates are against (his own definition of) ""constitutional rights."" This is basic stuff here. 

I'll never forgive conservatives' decades-long attack on both government and rhetoric. Bad-faith posturing and filling the heads of the gullible with nonsense all so they could drown government in a bathtub and get their tax cuts.

1. I can articulate a clear, fact- and science-based reason for getting vaxxed, motivated by concern for my fellow humans. A friend who refuses to get vaxxed can’t— or won’t— explain her reason for refusal. She is a single mom with three kids under 15 but won’t get her shot. Utterly irresponsible not just to society but to her children.  If the non-vaxxed refuse the shot, at a minimum they should have a cogent reason. 
2.  Feelings are NOT a cogent reason. (“I don’t feel ready….”) We’re at this pass after decades of respecting everyone’s feelings, no matter how batty or destructive. As a society we’d rather let people die than call out bad behavior. (Yes, risking your community and potentially causing death is bad behavior.) 
3.  As with the Vietnam War, vaccine “conscientious objectors” should face consequences. If you don’t care enough about your community to get a shot for the greater good, then leave the country. Although, last I checked, Canada is not admitting Americans."

If folks are that worried about COVID for themselves or their kids, why are they allowing themselves to be in an enclosed space with anyone who is not masked (vaxxed or not vaxxed).  Are these worriers, themselves, no longer wearing masks?

But we have a problem that is very dangerous and lacks simple solutions both because of inane human behavior and the helplessness of billions of others who have no vaccines.

She’s an up by the bootstraps kind of woman And she doesn’t take chances.  

This woman considers the vaccine a risk that could undo everything that she has done to make her life better. She comes from poverty
and ignorance and she’s got lots to lose. I think her family is poor and Hispanic. 

I’ve met others like this woman. Haven’t you?

I think there are many like this. But I’m not sure. As for her, I’m  pretty sure that she would get vaccinated if she were better educated on the matter. She obviously believed in education.

In March of 2020 Trump said this before he went AWOL: The fight against COVID19 is “our big war.”. “It’s a medical war. We have to win this war.""
  The virus' main weapon is the ability to replicate trillions of times and inevitably  produce variants. 
No replication equals  = NO variants;  Unvaccinated people = equals more infections; 
More infections = equals more variants.
   It is proven that we can defeat this viral enemy if we keep the virus from using unvaccinated infected people as virus factories.
Why are  American citizens still providing weapons bases for the enemy, and why did some Republicans and Fox News  cheer them on?  The answer is obvious and a cause of anger.  Hopefully, that anger will motivate Americans to vote."

Who knows the the next variant will overwhelm us. 

  When I was a child an uncle of mine came down with TB. He was mandatorily hospitalized in a sanatorium until he recovered. All immediate relatives were required (not requested) to show up for periodic chest x-rays and testing for TB.

It might be different if the portion of the population was smaller & the challenge less political and cultural. But its not just hesitancy now, in fact as time goes on hesitancy recedes & the overly cautious & fearful can be convinced to get vaccinated. Now the matter has become a matter of ""freedom"" and ""choice"" not social responsibility and community. That and the pressure to remain in ones tribe and refuse to recognize errors in judgement with the ego damage and shame that accompanies it has made it impossible for a large portion of the population to change course. The example of people dying of Covid while remaining in denial informs us how deep the physiological need to disconnect our personal choices from the personal outcome is. Self awareness is not a common human ability. Again I understand the anger driving people over the unwillingness of our fellow citizens to take precautions, get vaccinated and help heal our country, the pandemic has damaged my family in ways I can't even begin to express. If anyone deserves to be angry its someone like me. Yet will my (our) anger help? That is the question, finding a less destructive, more effective answer is essential.

Needless to say the second surgery will be cancelled. My husband and I have sacrificed greatly including a month long hospital stay for a non COVID condition.

A month and a half ago we invited some close friends – fully aware of how careful we have been and also fully vaccinated – to join us at a spacious patio for a meal for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Subsequently they invited us for dinner at their home. Upon our arrival, they mentioned that another couple we are also acquainted with would be joining us. Once they arrived - one is a physician – they revealed that they were not planning to be vaccinated. My husband and I were very discomfited and shocked that our friends would put us into the position of dining indoors, cheek by jowl, with them. We felt we had no choice but to stay as we were already well into the meal but made our exit far sooner than usual. I fear this has caused a rift and our friends have been very disrespectful of us. I am all for vaccine passports and allowing only the vaccinated into public establishments and events. When I immigrated to Canada as a child, we had to obtain compulsory vaccines prior to travel – if anything, there is more danger in today’s world as many of the diseases we were inoculated against were not nearly as prevalent or potentially deadly as is Covid-19."
2021-07-27 16:02:39,"I'm one of the angered. I have been fully vaccinated since January (I work in health care.) As others were vaccinated, I felt hopeful. I was trying to stay out of judgement of those who were ""waiting"" or ""I'm doing my own research."" 

My patience is zero now. Get. The. Shot. You are putting us all in danger - even us vaccinated. Shut up, stop believing in silly conspiracies, roll up your sleeves and get it done."
2021-07-27 15:59:59,"Those who worry about vaccine mandates ""backfiring"" are making the mistake of focusing on persuasion as the end goal. What we need right now is *compliance*. I'm totally fine with people continuing to hold their anti-vaxx or vaccine hesitant views as long as they get their COVID vaccine now. To that end, we need mandates by employers, schools, and public venues."
2021-07-27 16:12:58,"I’m sick of the unvaccinated holding the rest of us hostage.  Their concerns, questions, and hesitations regarding vaccines are meritless, indefensible, illegitimate, and unworthy of respect.  Appealing to their reason, decency, and sense of obligation is a waste of time at this point.  We got here by respecting all opinions, no matter how unfounded.  This pandemic will continue for years in endless cycles of masks, variants, and additional rounds of vaccines if we don’t adopt more punitive measures.  The unvaccinated and their selfish, aggressive ignorance pose a dire threat to public health.  Waiting for them to do the right thing is a fool’s errand."
2021-07-27 16:47:29,"If the vaccine works, then you are protected and you should not be worried about being infected by others.  If you can be infected after being vaccinated, then vaccinations don't work!  Then why should you be demanding that everyone else should be forced to take vaccinations that do not really protect you?"
2021-07-27 16:53:53,"Being nice hasn't helped. Giving them access to everything, grocery stores, drug stores, restaurants, etc., hasn't helped. I think we should have a vaccine mandate. I think we should require proof of vaccination to get into any facility. That includes grocery stores, drug stores, Theaters, everything. If they think they have the right not to take the vaccineine, so be it. But if they think they have the right to infect the rest of is rest of us, the answer is no no."
2021-07-27 16:56:09,"We Need To Create A New Chemical Warfare Charge
Those who refuse to be vaccinated and hence are subject to picking up the Covid virus would possibly change their minds if a new law were passed by Congress and soon if we want to think we are going to get out of this man created mess. This new law should make it a crime to pick up the virus, only for those who have not been vaccinated properly, for they will be the ones who pass this on and in many cases have another innocent victim die. Hence, no vaccination should mean that you can be charged with murder, attempted murder at the least as the passing of the virus is the same as using chemical weapons, and be subject to the same attempted murder penalties now in force. Are you ready to be charged or have you been smart enough to be vaccinated? The choice is yours."
2021-07-27 16:56:56,"There's an old legal doctrine that goes ""your right to swing your fist ends at my nose."" Some people think they have a ""right"" to remain unvaccinated. Perhaps. But that right ends when they infect someone else. At that point, they've committed negligent assault because they knowingly refused a course of action that could have prevented the infection. And if the person they infected dies, then that's criminally negligent homicide. There are laws (I believe in NY state) that can punish a person who knowingly has AIDS and deliberately takes no precautions from spreading it to another. I think the same applies here."

It always amazes me how the human brain can substitute one for the other without the slightest bat of an eye. Perhaps it's our own ability to fool ourselves—a capacity one might call intelligence—that is our downfall here. We can use our brains to solve problems, but we can also use them to ignore problems or make them worse. It's maddening. It's a lesson for all of us: when you believe something, don't look for evidence you are correct. Just do a minimal amount of work to make sure you are not wrong. In this case, people are dying while many of us just ignore what's right in front of our faces."

The credibility of the CDC which desperately needed to be rebuilt after the horrific Trump years has been decimated.  Dr. Walensky was a terrible hire who has hurt the Biden administration which could catastrophically lead to Trump being back.  She needs to be replaced.

The FDA needs to approve the vaccines.  The vaccines need to be mandated for the military.  Employers and schools need to mandate the vaccines.  Boosters need to be allowed. The CDC needs to start forcing vaccination providers to give a different vaccine to people who had allergic reactions.  The CDC needs to figure out a way to confirm vaccination status.

Also I am a firm believer in freedom of speech but at what point do we need to hold people accountable for misinformation that ends in the loss of life, do we have to get them to also yell fire in a crowded theatre before they become responsible for their actions."

As individuals, those leaders must someday be taken to task.

You require a learner's permit and a driver's license that must be renewed regularly but nothing for a gun owner?

You require a dog to have a rabies vaccine so it doesn't spread the disease but you won't mandate a vaccine for COVID?

No, our young unvaccinated children are not returning (or starting) public school on-site this fall because classes start in one week and the school system has yet to announce any guidelines for identifying vaccinated/unvaccinated faculty, staff or students, or any guidelines for mask-wearing in the classroom."

Why shouldn’t I be angry when I stepped up and got vaccinated, took care of the sick in the hospital and have been willing to wear a mask all day at work before and after being vaccinated?   
They can get sick and lose those they love if they want to, but don’t ask me to feel bad about it after I’ve sacrificed for them.

I want proof of vaccination before attending any social gathering such as a concert or movie or even a restaurant.
I want al teachers, at any lever, to be subject to mandatory vaccination. That goes for students too.

They have plenty of data to work with, far more than many other drugs they have approved in full in short time periods. Full approval will be the only way to start instituting mandates for institutional access (school, work, etc.).

""cars are an instrument of death.""

It is still better to be vaccinated than not, but the handwriting on the wall tells a story about the Delta variant that empirically appears to be able to often defeat the current mRNA vaccines which were designed to combat the earliest manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, referred to as COVID-19.

There are scientists  globally, who real are experts, involved with research,  not the public self-proclaimed, who have concluded COVID is a gain of function lab engineered virus to evade defeat. which means COVID has a propensity to continue to mutate into more easily spread and more lethals variants.  And we need a new solution able to stop a man made constantly shape changing virus. 

Clearly there has been an avalanche of misinformation, even from ulterior motive, not just assertions based on a lack of hands on knowledge, which is not derived from treating patients or reading the mere conclusions of others that make it into print."

My wife and I have fully returned to a normal life of dining out, going to the gym, etc.  The fact that the people who choose not to get vaccinated may actually cause restrictions to be reinstated is  maddening to me.  I'm at the point I have zero sympathy for any person unvaccinated by choice who gets and even dies of covid.  Though I do worry about the healthcare professional who will be at risk treating them.  I'm not sure about government mandating the vaccine.  But employers, restaurants, airlines, and any public venue should require it.  Unless you want to live alone in a cave you should need to vaccinated."
2021-07-27 16:47:02,"While I understand the rising resentment against the unvaccinated may have unintended consequences, I have lost all empathy and sympathy for those who resist vaccinations, whether it be distrust of government, belief in conspiracy theories or misinformation, or even waiting for final FDA approval. The unvaccinated are willingly and knowingly putting the population, the economy, and indeed our culture of American society at risk.  It is beyond selfish for the unvaccinated who become infected to endanger healthcare workers and those in their communities.

I would support insurance companies, Medicare, and Medicaid actions to refuse or reduce reimbursement to the unvaccinated on the basis that choice of forgoing vaccination directly contributed to illness. This is not an addiction issue, such as smoking, drinking or drug abuse - this is willful neglect and reckless activity.

It is worth reminding people that the population did not achieve herd immunity in beating polio. The vaccine beat polio.  COVID-19 is proving little different.

Finally, to those that claim freedom of choice and liberty as their justification for refusing the vaccine, I would remind them what Alexis De Tocqueville said nearly 200 years ago in his treatise on American politics and society:  liberty is America is regulated.  It is not unfettered."
2021-07-27 16:51:11,"From the outset of the vaccination drive, the messaging should have been about getting vaccinated to do one's part to keep others safe.

I am currently engaged in research regarding vaccination mandates. I strive to maintain a fair and balanced approach to the topic in my research. However, I am disgusted by the anti-vax crowd once I remove my professorial hat. Medical exemptions? Certainly. Religious exemptions? Doubtful given that so few religions forbid vaccination. Philosophical exemptions? No!   

I am scheduled to return to my university for the fall term in three weeks. My university is a state institution in a location where politics are GOP-dominated. Although private universities in the area are requiring vaccination (Emory, Morehouse, Spelman, Agnes Scott), state institutions are headed in the  opposite direction. No mask mandates, no vaccination requirements, and no social distancing. Faculty were reminded once again last week to avoid any appearance of distinctions on the basis of actual or perceived vaccination status. Apparently we are to pretend that the pandemic is over, and all is well again in the ivory tower.

I remain struck by a comment during an on-line meeting last spring that we are on our own with respect to our health. Self-preservation is the approach I intend to take this fall. My skepticism aside, I renew my call to the Regents of the University System of Georgia to follow the lead of hundreds of colleges and universities across the country and mandate vaccination."

Unfortunately, I can see a return to restrictions on gatherings coming down the pike due to the selfishness of the psudo-doctors who think they know better than scientists who have spent their whole careers on viruses/immunity. 

The answer is clear. Those who do not want to get vaccinated should not be able to participate fully in the reopening of society. 

New York State has developed the ""Excelsior Pass"" as proof of vaccination and businesses and the state and federal governments need to mandate businesses use it to allow entry to gatherings. 

I know businesses can't be compelled to exclude the non-vaccinated, but perhaps a few liability lawsuits in case COVID can be shown to be contracted on their premise will help convince them the smart, and profitable way to go is to isolate the anti-vaccers so they don't ruin everyone else's party.

2021-07-27 17:00:52,"I understand the anger. I feel it sometimes, too. It is excruciating to watch COVID numbers climb again, when we hoped we were past it. It's easy to think ""I did my part"" by getting the vaccine, and they need to do theirs.

The thing is, while we understand the short term result of not having vaccinations, we don't yet understand the long term results of getting them. Because, ""Yes."" These vaccines WERE fast-tracked. While fiction is only ""fiction,"" in popular storylore, the zombie apocalypse is often caused by a vaccine gone bad. If I were vaccine hesitant, this would be my main reason why. No. I don't support the conspiracy theorists and anti-vax hooplah.

But maybe. Maybe. It's not a bad thing for the nat'l vaccine glass to be half-full, if that is what people are choosing. 

Maybe focus on things like ENFORCING the federal mask mandate on all commercial flights, which everyone must AGREE TO---in writing, 3 times---in order to make a reservation. Every flight has the potential to be a super-spreader event. I've flown and seen broad differences in adherence to that law. It all depends on who is in charge of the flight crew. 

Maybe, for the next year, require masks for all face-to-face business encounters and public gatherings. Then see where we are. Rinse & repeat. 

The Delta variant is a factor, to be sure. But rates started climbing again when masking was set aside. And it's simple to enforce. It's very visual. You're in compliance or your're not."

she should definitely be judged. she should not be forced in the sense of holding her down and vaccinating her against her will, but i like all the other coercive suggestions offered by people quoted in the article: voluntarily unvaccinated people should lose health insurance coverage and have government benefits and tax refunds/credits withheld. they should be barred from going virtually anywhere indoors, including stores, public transit, workplaces, and entertainment venues.

The scammers, on the other hand, deserve all the ostracism we can muster. They have caused mass death, and should be treated accordingly. This is true not only of the disinformation dozen, all of whom have been causing havoc (and measles deaths) for years, but also figures on social media who ""converted"" to the antivaxx or vaxx-skeptical position during covid. Many of these figures are more dangerous because they had followings that weren't already fringe--and we are able to radicalize people who would never have listen to the dozen.

Rights are inseparable from duties, which require acting in ways that maintain and strengthen the conditions necessary for responsible exercise and expansion of rights, one's own and those of others. Because rights and duties are inseparable, the success of a democratic republic depends as much on fulfilling the one as it does on exercising the other.

As rights foundational to the expansion of individual and public well-being, we must act so as to maintain and strengthen individual and public health. Refusal to do so, especially when the means are so obvious and accessible, is a wanton disregard of undoubted moral and civic duty (allowing for religious principles and health conditions).

Putting one's personal convenience or inclinations ahead of duties to others deserves to be called out. Whether sanctions should be attached to it is uncertain (perhaps lowest priority for medical services might be appropriate). But no one should ever forget that at a time of great urgency, there were those who chose selfishness over moral and civic duty."

The idea that there is only a pandemic for the unvaccinated is not true. There are breakthrough cases. People can be infected and be asymptomatic and still carry and spread the virus. Strict mask mandates everywhere for a few months might end this thing. But none of the politicians seem to have the backbone to go there. I'm a supporter of President Biden and think he is mostly doing an excellent job. But...saying the pandemic only exists among the unvaccinated sends the wrong message. That message tells the vaccinated that masks are unnecessary and go back to life as normal. They jumped the gun."
2021-07-27 17:02:20,"It's not shocking to me that if you take a bunch of already skeptical people (who are skeptical for a variety of reasons - from governmental power concerns, to personal health concerns, to general bucking of authority) and then pummel them from all directions to do the thing they aren't too keen on doing...that they'll be even less likely to do it. 

What is shocking to me is how many people will openly wish them death and suffering.

(Please don't throw rocks at my head fellow Times readers, for I am vaccinated)."
2021-07-27 17:06:16,"When we applied for our green card, the government made us take a flu shot. We literally could not get medical clearing for our green card application unless we were vaccinated against the flu strain that year, besides all other regular vaccinations like tetanus, polio, etc. My son has PTSD and a needle phobia - so it was a huge undertaking to get him vaccinated against the flu. 

So it seems to me the freedom of choice related to vaccination is limited to citizens and not always a priority to the US, depending on who they deal with. I could bet my cat that green card applicants will have to prove vaccination against COVID going forward."
2021-07-27 17:19:48,"One argument I hear often is that many are afraid of losing pay due to needing time off after the vaccine. A simple solution to this is to have some of the PPP funding specifically earmarked to give all vaccinated employees 5 days of PTO. Conveniently, those who then vaccinate are eligible to get that time effective immediately upon getting the shot. Further, considering a good number of the people refusing to take the vaccine at this point are people between 18 and 49, perhaps a viable ""carrot/stick"" is student aid/ loans. Anyone who refuses to vaccinate when medically cleared/able to do so cannot apply for financial aid, and those who already received it cannot qualify for any interest reductions, deferment, or forgiveness that may apply if they refuse to vaccinate."
2021-07-27 17:57:00,"To all those unvaccinated people out there I say this. ""I don't want to hear one word of complaint from any of you when mask mandates and other Covid-19 mitigating rules are reinstated!!"" We've heard on the news how 95-99% of new Covid-19 hospitalizations are NONvaccinated people. How hard is that for you to understand? This is not a Political game. People die from this virus and many who survive are left with disabilities."

To get those who have chosen not to get the Covid 19 vaccine,  medical insurance firms raise the cost of insurance and/or lower the cost of insurance for the unvaccinated.

It has got to cost more to pay the medical bills of those who seem to be trying to get sick."
2021-07-27 17:45:31,"Choices have consequences and I believe choosing to not have the vaccine when your are eligible and able to health wise should mean you are not able to put others at risk - no flying in planes, taking public transport, working alongside others, eating at restaurants etc. A choice may have consequences you don't like. 

My two year old son doesn't have a choice but ultimately has to live with all of ours."
2021-07-27 17:48:48,"This is where businesses can take the lead.

Many of the largest do not pay taxes, so perhaps this is one area in which they can play a role in ensuring the public good.

Any return to work must include documentation of vaccination.

If you chose to not get vaccinated you could lose your job. Period!

There will be exceptions for medical for instance but unless you are willing to accept responsibility for the health and well-being of your colleagues, family and community- your presence will not be welcomed or allowed.

It’s a global pandemic and the virus is mutating but there are vaccines widely available and free to limit the spread.

Do your part- or sit home! Unemployed!"
2021-07-27 17:25:57,"Mass vaccinations worked for smallpox, measles, polio, etc. so unless someone has another way to get rid of virus infections that vaccines are very effective against our options for dealing with Covid-19 seem pretty limited. There is only one way out and the sooner we take it the better."
2021-07-27 17:30:01,"We keep on hearing the same things about the vaccines, in the US and elsewhere, how they were rushed and we need more time. So it seems People are knowledgeable enough about the vaccines to be hesitant about it, and yet they have not learned anything about a virus that started with one person being infected at the other end of the world, and millions now dead. What else do they/we need to change their mind?"
2021-07-27 17:31:31,"I want boosters to become available.  Right away.  I got vaccinated at the end of February and beginning of March.  We need to get boosters if we took Pfizer.  

Get these doses into arms, right away.  Everywhere in the world. Now, Yesterday. This is the only reasonable response."
2021-07-27 17:36:05,"We've had so many stories about the indignant unvaccinated, and this is the first I recall reading about the indignant vaccinated. Maybe if there is more media coverage of the latter, which is the majority, there would be higher rates of vaccination. For instance, I never saw until now an American quoted saying we should be bound by a social contract. When the media amplifies anti-vaxxers, it gives the impression everyone in this country is as selfish and individualistic as them. This shapes how we view our fellow citizens in a way that continues to degrade the social contract and creates a sense we're living in a FreedomLand dystopia. More broadly, in the U.S. we don't make it socially uncomfortable for selfish people. In fact, we make it uncomfortable for people who are concerned enough about the common good to call out the selfish people. That needs to change. Let's make unvaccinated group are made to feel part of a minority. Let's face it, while many people will do the right thing, some require mandates."
2021-07-27 17:38:12,"I'd suggest that the person who felt that Society needed to wait for them to decide to get Vaccinated is asking far too much from those of us who have already been Vaccinated. At this point, the Virus is more dangerous to unvaccinated persons than any of the few, rare reported side effects are. 

In Montgomery County MD, where I live, over 90% of all residents over the age of 12 have been vaccinated by now. We're a pretty populous county that's quite diverse. As such, I'm out of patience for the Unvaccinated and their weak, lame excuses.

Enough about their alleged rights. What about the rights of everyone else to be protected from COVID? The rights of vaccinated persons to life, liberty and their pursuit of happiness is being abrogated by those who refuse to get vaccinated. Enough is enough."
2021-07-27 17:46:32,"Anger indeed.  I'm a nurse on a unit in a large hospital where less than half of medical staff are vaccinated.  I got vaccinated the first day possible...then I got Covid last weekend at work.  I'm now stuck at home, ill,  inconveniencing my family, and livid that nurses and nurse aids are openly hostile to vaccines.  I am a healthy person with zero medical issues, but the variant knocked me out for two days.  It is immoral to not get vaccinated."
2021-07-27 17:30:06,"Here's my POV:  Get vaccinated or get out of my life. I am fortunate that (so far) every relative, friend, neighbor and tradesperson I know has been fully vaccinated. If I discover that ANY person I know has refused to be vaccinated by this point, that person will be cut out of my life forever, and I won't feel one iota of guilt about it.

There is no reason to pamper the people who are not just allowing this pandemic to continue, but who, in doing so, are also allowing MORE variants to develop."
2021-07-27 17:32:59,"Vaccine hesitancy and refusal is not a conservative phenomenon, only the COVD-19 vaccine. Childhood vaccine refusal and delay is rooted in a large part in liberal coastal cities. Here is Southern CA, the natural health movement is a large portion of vaccine refusal. Much of the misinformation is from this movement. 

The vaccinated population deserves to be angry. Personally, I have young children who cannot be vaccinated including a special needs child who would likely be more affected if sick. I want to be ensured that school staff are vaccinated. This is now a pandemic of ignorance and will cost many lives."
2021-07-27 17:33:25,"My personal situation is this. I was vaccinated 4 months ago with great trepidation. I'm over 70 and have respiratory issues. I continue to wear my mask in indoor places because I don't trust the vaccine enough to bet my life on it. At the same time, though it was a difficult decision, it was mine to make to get the vaccine. I fail to understand why people think they have the right to force, coerce, shame another person into making what I believe is a personal decision. My manicurist, for instance, hasn't been vaccinated. She wears a mask and takes every precaution inside her shop, sanitizing between customers. She's researched the vaccines thoroughly and has valid reasons for eschewing vaccination. I respect her right to make that decision.
 I hate guns, and I believe that the proliferation of firearms in this country endangers me and my loved ones, but I respect my fellow Americans' right to own guns. If we all showed each other more respect, we'd be a far happier, more peaceful, more productive society."
2021-07-27 17:38:47,"It seems to me there is a safe and effective solution to the vaccination problem.  It is staring everyone in the face.  Throughout the pandemic, the federal government has been sending large checks to Americans as stimulus payments to boost the economy.  More such payments are envisioned.  If the federal government made a requirement of proof of vaccination in order to receive any further stimulus checks, the unvaccinated problem would quickly disappear.  This is the carrot instead of the stick."
2021-07-27 17:41:50,"It got me thinking about a suggestion to increase the COVID vaccination percentage in the US.  Here it is

If the private company called Delta Airlines, as an example, announced that it would no longer 
admit to its premises (read airplanes) any person not fully vaccinated, it would 
probably increase their business as passengers concerned about COVID 19 would re-book from other 
airlines to Delta. As that happens other major carriers (American, United, Southwest among them) would move to implement 
the same policy to maintain their bottom line.

The net result could well be the vaccination of another 15% or more of the US population thus helping to stop the 
surely unnecessary deaths we are witnessing from false information about the safety and effectiveness of 
these remarkable lifesaving vaccines against COVID19.

It is very important that US private businesses (not government entities), such as these airlines, follow 
the lead of universities such as Indiana University and the University of California in 
standing up for public safety and our public health.

We should all wish them Godspeed!"
2021-07-27 17:42:30,I would like to know what percentage of unvaccinated already had Covid.  I am not seeing enough data on those who have immunity from having the virus.  Some recent research points to natural immunity being better than vaccination.  It would be good for us to know where we stand with our herd immunity which is not just made up of the vaccinated.
2021-07-27 17:46:21,"I earn the large majority of my income by traveling. I'm in better financial shape that others in my field so I can't complain - neither did I avail myself of the grants available to me, leaving whatever monies were available to those less financially stable. But it was a very difficult time for me because NOT being able to work as I do has taken an emotional toll. NOT being able to travel, one of the best parts of my work, has also taken an emotional toll. I have found that weighing my many blessings daily has helped me enormously. As has planning for 2022.

But now all of THAT work is imperiled, exclusively because of the junk science, ill-informed and - let's face it - selfish people who spurn this great advantage. Like voting, vaccination is something that people all over the world are dying to have, and I have zero patience for people who squander this tremendous privilege. I have asked anti-vaxxers to consider that vaccine aren't just for ourselves, they are our contribution to our community, to society and to the planet. But there are no facts that appeal to people who have already confirmed their biases based on non-facts. 

So yes, I am among those getting really, really angry. Not just for my own thwarted plans. I am SO ANGRY that we have no empathy left for others. And while I might shrug and think ""okay, let them kill themselves"", their ""freedoms"" seem predicated on denying freedom to others."
2021-07-27 17:40:21,"Every choice has consequences. It's something we teach our children and try to keep in mind for ourselves. Those consequences can fall upon us as individuals; the groups and communities we interact with; or both. 

The choice to get the vaccine confers individual protection--not complete, but very substantial--against COVID. It also works to the benefit of one's family, social circle, and larger community. Those are positive consequences. 

The choice not to get the vaccine raises the risk of contracting COVID to oneself and to everyone in close proximity. That's a negative consequence. It's in society's interest to strongly disincentivize that choice--including through sanctions that can include job loss and the cutting off of access to large group settings. 

What rankles me so much here is how the assertively unvaccinated evince no sense of shared responsibility--no acknowledgement that being part of a community might entail some limits on your choices and freedoms. 

You don't necessarily have to stop your car at red lights either. But not doing so puts yourself and others in potentially mortal danger. This is not much different."

I'm on the border of red and blue, the blue have their shots for the most part, the others mingle among us with their sly smiles that practically scream ""Make me, you lamestream commie sheep.""

I enjoyed a few outings without a mask, I even went out to eat at a restaurant.  I was thinking of even catching a movie I wanted to see in a theater.

That's over now.   My freedom is diminished because of the high number of people who think over 600,000 deaths is a hoax.  People who will deny having COVID as they lay dying from it.

I highly resent it.  It could be worse, my two grandchildren who are still in high school have opted to continue online.  Thank God for that.  My heart goes out to parents of young children who will be forced back to work with disease carriers, and their children have no protection.  What ever happened to pro-life?

The economy will suffer because of these people, and then they will turn around and blame the very people that tried to save the economy AND them.

We may perish or diminish as a nation because so many of us were just too stupid, selfish and uncaring for us to collectively survive.  Now that, MR TRUMP, IS ""sad.""  I'll blame you and your followers forever, and see you all as a willing accomplice to manslaughter."
2021-07-27 15:33:20,At this point society owes nothing to unvaccinated Americans. Anyone who wants the vaccine has had a monthlslong opportunity to get it. Vaccine refusers are unwilling to take even the most basic steps to protect their own health and the society around them. There’s justice in letting these people get COVID.
2021-07-27 15:37:03,"Canada had this right, months ago. ""Violating any instructions provided to you when you entered Canada is an offence under the Quarantine Act and could lead to up to:
6 months in prison and/or $750,000 in fines
If you break your mandatory quarantine or isolation  requirements and you cause the death or serious bodily harm to another person, you could face:

a fine of up to $1,000,000 or
imprisonment of up to 3 years or both.

I wonder what their penalties are for intentionally spreading false information about vaccines which results in another person's death. I hope it is a lot more than $1 million and 3 years in prison. We know specifically who is spreading lies about vaccines via Facebook, Fox News and other channels. Why are these individuals not in prison?"

Oh shut up.  I'm a social scientist, and even I can't bear this drivel.

There are times when reality smacks us in the face.  This is one.  We tried persuading, to a lethal degree.  We wasted miracle after medical miracle.  We're approaching an event horizon on human existence (possibly).

Those who will be persuaded had their shot.  Those who will not wasted theirs.

This is not some airy free speech debate.  This is people freely going about urging others to die, making great fortunes doing it.

And we wonder what our approach should be.

Let's play The New American Game: You don't want vaccine, fine that's your right.  We're nothing if not suicidally sensitive to your needs.

But, listen, no vaccine: no job, no insurance, no hospital, no airplanes, no concerts, no delightful meals out, no schools, no libraries, no standing in line to vote (good luck with mail-in ballots), shopping only at NoVax Mart, gas only at COVID Goes, no home deliveries without sterile reception facilities...

See ya when you're healthy again partner or when, you know, you're not.  Anymore.

This isn't about rights or beliefs (even ""sincerely held religious"" ones) this about beating a medical enemy that's just getting started, and ferreting out the traitors in our midst."
2021-07-27 14:49:11,"So what are we going to do when the next virus arrives that is more contagious and more deadly?  Are we going to respect the ""rights"" of others so that they can freely infect others?  They are freeloaders on the rest of us who took the time to get the vaccine.  Fox News and the Republican party are to blame with their disinformation and spreading distrust of government and science.  Time to get mad."

2021-07-27 17:03:52,"Well, adopting a conciliatory tone and trying to understand their motivations has worked wonders for our country thus far. 

Yeah there are some people with legitimate reasons not to get vaccinated, but many who don't basically just don't feel like being cooperative. ""I don't wanna. You can't make me. Nyah.""

When my six year old acts like a petulant jerk, he gets a warning and explanation, and then a consequence if he doesn't change what he's doing. Given that a good chunk of these folks are operating on the same emotional level as my six year old, maybe there should be some similar consequences - like not being able to do the things they want to do."

There is no point in engaging anti-vaxers. They have a cult mentality and intractability that only a skilled clinician may be able to undo. Or, they are simply lacking the intelligence to process the information available to them, no matter how simply put.
Enough is enough. We have offered incentive after incentive, explained the science in simple and approachable language and pleaded. 
They are not victims who deserve our endless patience and sympathy. They are willfully ignorant selfish cowards whose choice effects innocent others. We can not kowtow to the beliefs and delusions of the lowest common denometer any longer. 
Time for consequences. No vaccine, no entry to public spaces and events. No excuses, no exceptions. Actions (and inactions) have consequences. 
An informed and civil society must send a message and reject them until they are ready to be responsible citizens."

2021-07-27 14:46:11,"When Donald Trump and his supporters, enablers and members of the Congress, all broadcast misinformation, lies and do nothing but create misgivings,  and add to the chaos of this pandemic, the there is ample reason for those who have been vaccinated to harbor deep resentment and anger towards everyone who refuses to be vaccinated.  
The Republicans who support Trump and his cronies are doing great damage to the health, welfare and safety of millions of Americans.  They don't give a hoot about other Americans including their friends, neighbors, families and children.  They place everyone at great risk. Everyone!
“The virus is here and it’s killing people, and we have a time-tested way to stop it — and we won’t do it. It’s an outrage.”
The people who are being victimized again and again by those who refuse to be vaccinated are indeed outraged.  
The ""refusers"" especially members of the Congress are without morals, ethics or honest intentions.  They are liars.  Each and everyone of those refusers in the Congress should be summarily removed from office and charged with violating their oath of office and endangering the lives and safety of all Americans.  
Republican governors and Republican dominated state legislatures need to reconsider their stance on vaccinations and masks and think about public safety not about their ability to be re-elected for another term in office. They have also greatly betrayed all Americans."

Every business and public institution need to require a vaccination.  Don't like it, move on, it'd a free country, but you have no business impacting me.  Exemptions for health only.  No lame ""religious"" exemptions.  I know of no major world religions that have ever said no to vaccines.  This vaccine has been given to millions with very, very few problems, so I don't buy the lame excuse of it's not approved.  The people who say this don't understand any of the science.

For that matter I am for fines after a certain period of refusing a vaccination, and yes we need vaccine passports that can't be faked.

Here in the US, the cautious of the vaccinated will probably have to return to wearing masks, as it's perfectly obvious that most unvaccinated people aren't wearing the masks that they're asked to wear.  THAT is what makes me angry.

Was told that vaccination/mask wearing is a personal choice and “you can get Covid anyway.”

As soon as I got home, I called the practice, thinking the young tech was misinformed. I gently, diplomatically asked for confirmation. Right off the bat, the receptionist asked if I wanted my records transferred. No! I assured her. The vet was great. 

She left the phone, conferred with someone, and told me that under no circumstances would they ask employees to either get vaccinated or mask up.

“Even for an immunocompromised client?”

Nope.

My Science teacher told her students that if they wanted to pass her class they had to get the shot.  Any student that did not get the shot, no matter the reason and regardless of their grades, would fail her class.  The entire school lined up for the shot.  That would probably be illegal today, but when you think about it, polio is not an issue anymore because pretty much everyone got vaccinated.  And eventually the Saben polio vaccine was offered outside supermarkets and on street corners.  It is beyond selfish and stupid to resist a life-saving vaccine just because...well, actually I can't think of a compelling reason to not take the vaccine.

The silly excuses for not taking it involve such idiotic things as fear of being microchipped or becoming magnetic or maybe having a side-effect.

I see liberals wanting to go after individuals for putting others at small (but significant) amounts of risk. 

I see them wanting to threaten to take away their healthcare. 

I don’t see them wanting to jail the controllers of global capital who, through the very way they make money, murderously cause the deadly poverty of hundreds of millions or even billions of people and the climate change that will likely be the death of our society (but who will post the right things to their corporate Instagram accounts). 

Instead, they seethe with cultural rancor over something that they themselves are vaccinated against, something that is a small fraction as likely to harm someone. 

If you’re not going after the real murderers with a proportionate amount of zeal, leave the person who admittedly should be vaccinated but isn’t alone.

1. You can’t say that there was no pressure to get the vaccine out to the public when White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told the head of the FDA to submit his resignation if the agency doesn’t clear Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use by day’s end, By the end of the day the CDC approved it for emergency usage.
2. Emergency use? (If it’s so safe why not just approve it as a treatment?)
What Is Emergency Use Authorization?
According to the FDA, ""During a public health emergency, the FDA can use its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority to allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products, to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases when certain criteria are met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.""

It is not a matter of liberty when the refusal to do something endangers someone else directly. 

I'm kind of confused about the trepidation to simply require it.  All kinds of immunizations are required in schools and other public places.  

For example, in NY schools the following are required:

-Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine and Pertussis vaccine (DTaP or Tdap)
-Hepatitis B vaccine
-Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR)
-Polio vaccine
-Varicella (Chickenpox) vaccine
Additional vaccines required for middle school and high school
-Tdap vaccine for Grades 6-12
-Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) for Grades 7-12
-Students in Grade 12 need an additional booster dose of MenACWY on or after their 16th birthday
Additional vaccines required for day care and pre-K
-Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (HiB)
-Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine (PCV)

Some of my friends from grade school got together and went out in one of their boats. As it turned out 3 out of the 5 of us were unvaccinated.

The conversation included a general distrust of anything they had heard on TV (which probably didn't include Fox News, because they concurred about how much they detested Nancy Pelosi and AOC).  The pandemic was called a ""scamdemic"" and they all espoused their own common sense in being superior to anything they had heard from epidemiologists and scientists.  Apparently one of them had said that if I showed up with a mask he would not have gone out. My eyes rolled so many times that I'm surprised they are still in my head.

We truly are living in two different Americas. People like this are defiant and unmalleable. They will not believe that the fire exists until it literally chars their skin.

This learned skepticism (and I'm not afraid to place the blame on the right here) overshadows any sense that they are putting the rest of us at risk.

I went home to my parents, who are 78 and 80, hoping, despite us all being vaccinated, that I wasn't bringing anything with me.

Now the majority of the staff has been vaccinated. But since all the children are younger than eleven, they have not.

I imagine the staff and the children will continue to need to be masked when we go back in mid August. Not because of anything the children or staff did. But because there are so many non-vaccinated adults in American society that that the numbers of COVID cases has not come down to a safe enough level where staff and children can be without masks together.  Logistically, if the children are to be expected to be masked, the staff needs to set the example and wear masks too.

Am I angry? Absolutely. I hate wearing a mask seven hours a day. It can be hot. It constricts my breathing. Children, especially those with special needs, have a difficult time understanding speech through masks as well.

How do you discuss the vaccine with someone who is worried about long term consequences or side effects, when they don't want to realize that people have now been vaccinated more than a year (trials have been going on since like April 2000) and haven't seen anything. People get a flu vaccine every year that is different, they will use drugs that just were put on the market who haven't been around 10 years. They talk about horrible side effects, yet over 1 billion people have been vaccinated and the number of side effects that are serious is statistically tiny. 

I agree with consequences. Faux News makes it really hard to work there unvaccinated. There is nothing wrong with the federal government denying states funding that don't meet vaccination goals.

While no vaccine is fully risk-free, over half of the over-age-12 American population fully vaccinated. That's over 100 million people. Side effects have been absolutely minimal in both number and severity.

The arguments that people make against getting vaccinated are at best uninformed and at worst selfish. The libertarian ""don't tell me what to do"" argument doesn't hold, because vaccination or lack of it affects not only the individual, but everyone around him/her.

Right now, the vast majority of those who die of COVID, of those who contract COVID, and of those who are hospitalized with it are unvaccinated.

By not getting vaccinated, they're helping to spread the new Delta variant.

Apart from the under-12 set (a vaccine is coming!) and a small minority of people who should not get the vaccine (e.g. the immunocompromised and some other groups), not getting vaccinated is selfish, puts others at risk, and helps spread (and thus create) new variants.

It's time to start discriminating against those who willfully refuse to get vaccinated. Just as schoolkids can't attend public school without various vaccinations, those who can't prove vaccination should not be allowed in places where they put others at risk.

I'd be wary of settling on any of these reasons while the data is still unclear. We don't really know what this virus is doing, and we have little, if any, ability to predict its future course. We should be upfront about that. Instead of glibly rattling off reasons for the virus's resurgent rise."

But that also doesn’t mean we have to cower in fear or subject ourselves to irresponsible people. The policies announced yesterday by the governor of California and the mayor of NYC are sensible compromises: if one chooses to be unvaccinated, there are remediating measures that will be required, including weekly virus testing (at their expense), mandated masks while inside and in certain circumstance outside, no admission to some venues where measures cannot be taken to preserve the health of all. And these measures must be rigorously enforced: no free-riders who refuse to cooperate with public health measures, but enjoy the freedoms that vaccinations confer.

Take a stricter stance now.

Fully approve vaccines.  We just did the largest phase three clinical trial in history.

Mandate vaccination for return to offices, any travel on planes or trains, any concerts, any retail shopping, any movies, any public activity.

Then if you still refuse to get vaccinated only you suffer the consequences and must remain locked down in your home.

We all gave our name and information when we got the vaccine.  The CDC has the data.  Mandate a vaccine passport.

These cases and yes, deaths, don't seem to be reported or investigated as even possibly related to the vaccine.

However, having decided against the vaccine, I continue to social distance, stay home, get my groceries delivered, and avoid any situation where I could get COVID. I continue to double mask in situations where I absolutely must go into a store or see a medical professional.

It seems simple to me. The pandemic isn't over. And for people like me who choose not to be vaccinated, we have to act like nothing has changed. It's in our own self interest and that of others.

It's time to make the unvaccinated wear masks. I do not support mandating masks for the vaccinated. At some point, the vaccinated crowd will just refuse to do this. I mean, the unvaccinated are doing whatever they want. So, why shouldn't the vaccinated people do likewise?"
2021-07-27 18:42:47,"Society had to wait for the vaccine. Society should not have to wait for those that elect not get vaccinated. 

I feel nothing for vaccine-eligible teens and adults like the person quoted in the article saying, ""Society will just have to wait for us."" Society does not need to wait for you - or impose additional mandates to protect you. Responsible society, masked up, made sacrifices, and took precautions while waiting for a vaccine to be developed and put into wide distribution.  Those vaccines have been available for some time now. 

I can respect an individual's personal decision not to get vaccinated - that is their choice. I would also hope that same person would continue to taking the other precautions that many of us did prior to availability of the COVID vaccines. I doubt, however, that is happening in a majority of situations.

I do feel for young children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine - and their parents. I am vaccinated, yet I continue to carry a mask with me and will not hesitate to put it on in public places where masked workers or adults with young children are present. I have no issue continuing to exercise caution or make sacrifices for these people.

Yet, when I encounter unmasked adults (sans kids) in private or public settings - the mask stays in my pocket and my thoughts are 'I hope you're vaccinated, but if you're not - you're on your own'."
2021-07-27 18:09:08,"My wife and I (both vaccinated) recently refused to hire a contractor to do work on our house, even though he had done many projects for us over the last 30 years.  The reason?  He'd declined to be vaccinated.  We were polite but firm.  Whether the economic consequences of his vaccination decision change his behavior remains to be seen, but I have to think that if they become severe enough -- meaning others refuse to do business with him, too -- he will see the light.  Here's hoping."
2021-07-27 17:51:49,"Unfortunately under current Federal and State law, insurance companies cannot modify premiums on individual, group or Medicare Advantage plans based on vaccination status. I work for a regional health plan and know this to be true. It would not be unreasonable to increase premiums based on vaccination status. I think that is a fine idea. This would be similar to your auto insurance premiums increasing after a speeding ticket. But such a change requires Federal action. Insurance companies currently cannot make such a change unilaterally."
2021-07-27 18:42:51,"In my county (San Francisco) 76% of adults have been fully vaccinated. Serological testing shows antibodies to SARS CoV-2 in over 90% of adults. Almost everyone, vaccinated or not, wears masks in public, indoors or out. 

According to the New York Times yesterday 709 new cases of Covid-19 were detected in San Francisco County, a huge jump over the previous 7-day daily average of 139. Hospitalizations are up 136%. The virus seems to be surging here, and the unvaccinated do not seem to be the problem."
2021-07-27 17:30:54,"I can’t even wrap my head around why you wouldn’t get a vaccine! Worrying about the potential of adverse reactions should be put aside because you could be DEAD before you even reach that point. This country’s  obsession with individual liberties is going to be the death of it. Not giving an inch to help others whether it be a vaccine, stricter gun control or the availability of insurance has reached a point beyond neglect and is leading to outright death, and those responsible have absolutely no shame."
2021-07-27 17:40:23,"Is there a point where insurance companies can refuse to cover those who have chosen to not get vaccinated?

Choosing not to be vaccinated should be coupled with forfeiting any medical coverage associated with COVID."
2021-07-27 17:57:30,"This article could have devoted more time to the opinion of the Republican governor of Alabama.
Well, there is no way patients who are unvaccinated will be held accountable. I wish, but will never happen. Our prices are too crazy.
Also, there is no social contract. I wish there was. Incremental steps to building one would be great, e.g. closing the border."
2021-07-27 18:28:31,"Why are the ""rights"" of those who refuse to get vaccinated more important than my rights ( I was  vaccinated in April), and the rights of friends, family, community members?  They aren't.  There should be consequences to presenting one's self as a genuine danger to others-- as there would be if someone was wielding a gun in the streets and randomly shooting--because that is what not being vaccinated is.

We are at the point where new variants such as Delta, make the virus far more transmissible and dangerous-- and there should be consequences for those who ""choose"" not to be vaccinated-- for the variety of non-persuasive reasons: not trust government, not believe in virus, vaccines unproven.
While we can't do to non-vaxers what is done at airports to smokers-- confine them together in a smoky room-- they should be confined to one car on trains/subways--if they can't show proof; denied insurance coverage for the exorbitant costs of treatment if they get sick-- after all-- they chose to do nothing,-- and barred from working in essential public functions where they can spread illness, particularly health care; food services; schools; public transport.

This is a global health crisis which will not subside until these selfish, foolish individuals either succumb to their own ignorance, or stick out their arm and get jabbed.  I am totally fed-up with the untoward risk they put on others. If they don't get a shot-- they should stay home and away from others permanently."
2021-07-27 18:31:08,How long until insurance companies start limiting coverage benefits for people who refuse to get vaccinated ?
2021-07-27 18:08:45,"Yes, I am angry and I agree the insurance agencies and governments should adjust their plan policies and assistance accordingly in this case. Another thought in mind is that if persuasion is not enough to overcome the conviction of the anti-vaxxers, then will the natural law be the equalizer eventually.  Unfortunately, no doubt some and more innocent ones and societies would be paying the price along with it as we can see happening now.  Also, this reminds me of the accidental discovery of the natural selection in action during one of the studies of the baboon colonies in Africa by Stanford physiologist Robert Sapolsky that during an outbreak in the baboon colonies all or most of the most aggressive dominant baboons were killed due to their behaviors.  In that instance, the baboons actually got to enjoy a few years of peaceful living afterwards (no implications here)."
2021-07-27 18:32:19,"Message to Mr Perldeiner: Why did (or do?) you allow your ""close family member"" continued access to you and your children if you are aware that she's unvaccinated? She has a choice to become ill from Covid, and you have a choice (an obligation, actually) to protect your children from her poor choices. Family members who aren't allowed to see parents, grandchildren, children and siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins etc unless they get fully vaccinated is the first step toward full vaccination in the US. Poor choices have consequences--hers as well as yours."
2021-07-27 18:43:55,"What bothers me the most is the shear selfishness of the anti-Vaxers. I get that some people were hesitant because of the speed of vaccine production but everyone should see the risk they are creating. If you think variants are ending with Delta, think harder. What if the next vaccine is more deadly, more virulent, and affects kids?  The few of us who are vaccinated, the greater number of people catching covid, the greater the chance that a new variant will appear. It is as simple as that."
2021-07-27 14:43:24,"The “greatest generation which fought WWII and won the peace in Germany, Japan and Italy, went not because they loved war but because it was their civic duty.  That’s the way my Korean War generation (I didn’t fight but I went) thought about military service.

Vietnam was different.  Many young men of draft age were Draft Dodgers, among them former Presidents. Some of that was due to the fraught nature of the war but  the sense of duty of the previous age had receded into the background. 

It’s one thing to hesitate to get vaccinated but full bore Vax Deniers are, in fact, Vax Dodgers, worthy of opprobrium because they refuse to honor the social contract which is supposed to bind Americans together. It would be one thing if all  Vax Dodgers did was endanger themselves but they endanger the commons. 

The “experts” (“men from out of town”, in W.C. Fields’
definition) who fear pressure on Vax Dodgers will backfire may be wrong.  If COVID vaccination is a civic duty, those who do not heed the call deserve opprobrium. 

We should distinguish between Vax Hesitant, who deserve persuasion, supported by lots of information, and Vax Dodgers, whose willful refusal to get a shot deserves repudiation.  No freedom to infect others is found in the Bill  of Rights."
2021-07-27 17:30:31,"The US government should start offering incentives for people to get in vaccinated. I would pay $500 for every one that could offer proof that they got both shots. For those who have already got their shots you could give them another $500 off on their tax returns. 

This would be cheap at 10 times the price because a few weeks in the intensive care in the ICU on a ventilator cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paying people a few dollars to get vaccinated you'd up the vaccination rate dramatically. Even the people who didn't wanna get these shots would get them just to make the money.

The US government should start to show some guts and Restrict access to all sports events and to dining inside a restaurant and all public gatherings such as going to the grocery store or other stores without wearing a mask.

Like it or not we are in a war and the fight of our lives"
2021-07-27 18:50:27,"We had to drive around the state in April to get vaccinated. Now, my state is trying to change the minds of anti-vaxxers by entering them in a $1,000,000 lottery (paid for with my tax dollars), if they get themselves vaccinated."
2021-07-27 18:54:39,"I finally lost it with my sister, an Evangelical Christian in her early  60s who has type II diabetes.  She couldn't stop yapping about her ""constitutional rights to free speech"" and sent me several YouTube videos and website links of bogus ""experts"" who claim that vaccines are somehow even more dangerous than Covid itself.  A lot of her resistance, I believe, arises not out of genuine medical concerns, such as possible side effects, but rather that she is somehow being ""oppressed"" by those who want her and others to get the shot.  (Did I also mention that she's white and heterosexual and grew up in the same privileged household that I did?)  In other words, the people, like my sister, who keep invoking their rights have little or no concern for the rights of others.  It's time to stop humoring them.  As I told my sister, there is nothing in the Constitution about being guaranteed a particular job if you don't get vaccinated, or the right to travel or see our 91 year-old mother in person (she's in an assisted living facility).  Enough already!"
2021-07-27 17:36:39,"Two things need to happen:  The FDA needs to complete its review process for awarding permanent, full authorization for the vaccines.  This will eliminate the lame excuse that ""it's only an emergency authorization so how do I know it's safe?""   Once that's done then governments (including schools) and employers need to require vaccination as a condition of employment.  People will grumble but they will get the shots."
2021-07-27 18:14:11,"Well, I'm furious. I have an unvaccinated kid and am on an immunosuppressant. I don't go to my local grocery anymore because some people come in unmasked now. I'd confront them but don't want to increase my risk from them. 

I called the grocer and asked them to do the right thing. The manager was pleasant and understanding enough but couldn't promise anything but to raise my concerns to the owner."
2021-07-27 18:30:31,"It’s called moral hazard. 

If you if you allow people to take unnecessary risks because they know you will bail them out if they encounter any problems, they have no incentive to stop taking those risks.  Protecting people from the consequences of taking unnecessary risks simply encourages people to take unnecessary risks.

Like so many other people have said, health insurance companies need to make willingly unvaccinated people with no medical reason for not vaccinating pay for their covid treatment. 

It’s no different than with seatbelts.  If you get injured in a car accident that’s not your fault, the insurance company will pay your claim, but not the full amount, because the severity of your injuries are in large part due to your own negligence in refusing to wear a seatbelt.

It’s time to stop coddling these snowflakes and make them pay for the consequences of their actions."
2021-07-27 17:34:36,"I have been dealing all  year with a joint custody situation where my partner's 10 year old daughter is the vector in my house, thanks to the idiocy of her ex-husband. He has been vaccinated, thankfully, but his other, grown, daughter refuses to be. She visits them often and he has been taking the 10 year old out for dinner occasionally, and is often allowing indoors playdates, without masks, and even sleepovers. I am holding my breath until she tests positive. (Today, she woke up with a fever and sore throat, but a rapid antigen test returned negative; PCR results will come in a day or two.) This process has increased the stress of the pandemic a lot for me. I have seen very little discussion of joint custody problems and the pandemic, but it must affect millions of families."
2021-07-27 17:49:38,"I'm done with being nice to the anti-vaxx crowd. Just isolate them and cancel them. Restaurants, shops, businesses, schools, airports, public transport, stadiums, theaters, arenas & govt. bldgs should all require proof of vaccination, just like they mostly ban smoking or guns. At this point, I'm willing to give them their own country - the Unvaccinated States of America - and it's pretty easy to see that the area of the Confederacy would be a good match for them, given its vaccination rates and political leaders.

I know that the law requires health facilities to treat everyone, whether or not they can pay for the treatment. The more COVID cases, the more my insurance premium increases. I don't want to be in the same risk pool with the unvaccinated.

I'm fully vaccinated, but my daughter is immunocompromised. Every time I leave the house to go shopping, I incur the risk that I will become infected and pass the infection on to her. Travel, of course, is out of the question, even though we would avoid the high risk states."
2021-07-27 17:53:32,"The pandemic is worse that it had to be because too many Americans challenged the science and agitated against public health measures, even making a point of doing things that can speed the spread of Covid.  Now many of these same people are refusing to get vaccinated, and nor surprisingly refusing to accept that the vast majority of cases and deaths are amongst the unvaccinated.  It is impossible to see eye-to-eye with people have no intention of doing anything that can help the situation, and plan to keep making it worse."
2021-07-27 18:15:05,"To be honest, I think it should be universally mandated. Preferably, world wide. It's public health. I can't throw gasoline on a public sidewalk and light it on fire. Yet people can freely walk around, without masks, potentially carrying a deadly virus that has killed 606,000 people, without getting vaccinated?

I think this virus is going to keep swimming out there in human bodies, potentially evolving into something far more dangerous. We're certainly giving a darn good chance."
2021-07-27 17:26:34,"Like others who have posted, I am angry and bitter. The country is politically divided on the issue of getting the COVID-19 vaccine or not getting the vaccine. Now that the virus has a new variant and the unvaccinated are contracting it and suffering, some are interviewed by the media. Most are expressing shock, stating that they didn't think the threat is real. Others are stating they wished they had listened. Many continue to spread their wild conspiracy theories on the supposed side effects of the vaccine. Where have these people been for the last 18 months? We've had over 614,000 deaths in the US and over 4 million worldwide. Hundreds of thousands of businesses have closed, crippling the economy, and closing schools. Health care workers have put their lives on the line to care for the sick, with many contracting the virus and dying. There isn't enough space for me to point out the lunacy of some states acting wildly out of bounds due to political pressure to not promote safety measures and vaccinations. Yes, I'm angry and bitter. We have the tools to overcome COVID-19, but many of us do not have the will or courage to accept facts. People who aren't getting the vaccine, spreading insane theories are irresponsible and selfish. Too bad there isn't a time out corner for folks who endanger others while turning a blind eye to undeniable truth: masks and vaccines can save us. Pure slap irresponsibly and selfishness do not."
2021-07-27 17:26:56,"I am no more angry at the unvaccinated -- who might well be antibody positive from exposure, by the way -- than I am at people who decide to drive without using their seatbelts, or who don't get a flu vaccine in the fall. Their choices put their lives in their hands. They are not the choices I would make, but I bet I'm making some risk choices -- like rock climbing, skiing in the back country, or living in a high-crime city -- that they would not make."
2021-07-27 17:43:29,"I get a little angry at officials for insisting it's an ""unvaccinated pandemic."" The relative I just lost was indeed vaccinated, and we have lost many vaccinated people along with many more unvaccinated. Vaccination helps, but isn't sufficient; ditto with wearing masks. Meanwhile, we leave open the indoor places with people close together where the pandemic is actually spreading, when the same activities outdoors in relative safety at this time of year. When the virus is in the (indoor) air itself, it's a little foolish to put all your hope on protecting each individual who breathes it from every other individual who breathes it, instead of having everyone breathe clean air in the first place."
2021-07-27 17:43:40,"I hesitated to read through comments, knowing they would be carbon copies of what's been said on this site for months.

That said I, too, can be an unabashed gluttony for web punishment, so I stuck my toe into the waters. Yup, same fury.

By now it should be clear that those who wanted vaccination immediately have gotten it. Those who are awaiting final approvals which move vaccine beyond  emergency use are waiting for that.

Those who will never get it, won't.

The US should ""grow some"" and close access to venues from planes to restaurants to entertainment, not to punish unvaccinated but slow spread.

And, no, contrary to sweeping judgment, these are not all supporters of djt. 

I was vaccinated in March, but in mid-September I'll pay out of pocket for an antibody test to ensure I'm protected.

There is much that is unknown about length and strength of immunity; what happens if Moderna, which I got, begins to lose potency? Booster? At what point? Will boosters be emergency status?

Continuing to yammer and call people names is useless and most are not reading these comments anyway. Restrictions on access are the recourse. I'd like to get back to the Symphony in fall and know who is sitting beside me."
2021-07-27 17:43:46,"I had to get vaccinated in order to get my visa approved to come to the United States. We're hoping to travel to parts of East Africa in the next couple of years and I fully expect to be asked to acquire some vaccines along the way and to show proof of those at border crossings. This is LIFE. This is nothing new.  I would like to see a vaccine requirement for international travel (with the exception of those who are medically unable to be). If you don't want a vaccine passport, then you might as well toss your regular passport. I had to do it to come to your country - why can't you do it for your own country? Sure, there are no flyovers or flag-waving, but doing the right thing isn't always about that."

2021-07-27 18:27:37,"The solution has to be through the free market; insurance companies, private schools, workplaces, etc. must be the ones requiring vaccination. If the federal government starts pulling out the stick it's instantly ""tyranny"" and ""oppression"", more of the same victim complex. If you get corporations on different levels docking people for being unvaccinated, the typically libertarian minded anti-vaxers will have nowhere to place blame. They won't be able to blame Joe, and they would certainly never blame anything on 'capitalism'. It's their own precious free market at work."
2021-07-27 17:27:38,"I’m grateful that I was able to get the vaccine when they opened up shots to my age group. I’m grateful for the very hard work of health care professionals and the scientists in this and other countries to develop several very effective vaccines in relatively short order. And, yeah, I’m grateful that the last administration – though I did not vote for them nor ever would – got the vaccine development ball rolling quickly, and that the current administration enabled a very efficient distribution of the vaccines so soon after they came into office.

We are still a country that can do big things. We are fortunate, more than most, and we are lucky to have the resources at our disposal to do these things.

Having said that, I’ve been thinking it’s time we start helping out less fortunate and less vaccinated countries at a faster rate. As others have said, viruses do not know borders. 

Set a time limit. Help the vaccine-hesitant make up their minds. Notify we will begin sending significant portions of our unused vaccine stock and capacity to needy countries. Not all doses, mind you. But enough to make a real global impact. Keep enough here for those  groups who do not yet qualify but may soon. Keep some for those yet to receive their vaccines.

However, the voluntary unvaccinated still making up their minds may need to consider they’ll face longer waits for scheduled appointments, endure longer lines at vaccination sites, or have to travel farther distances to find the vaccines."
2021-07-27 17:45:09,"This controversy shows that person’s body is his or hers own and the government should not mandate how each of us treats it.

2021-07-27 18:12:56,"I've been compassionate toward those who felt nervous, hesitant, or skeptical about receiving a vaccination against this scourge of a pandemic months ago when vaccination was new & untried by many.

But, as the months have rolled forward after December when the vaccine was first available and the numbers of Covid-19 cases began to seriously decline, I felt highly annoyed but still hopeful that hold-out non-vaccinated people would come to their senses & do the right thing to protect themselves & tens of thousands more.

Now, after living a severely limited life for over 15 months burdened with fear, worry, apprehension and no social connections with family or friends since the Delta variant's rise, I feel nothing but contempt for those who refuse to be fully vaccinated. (I was in April).

This isn't politics--people's lives are at stake; people are still DYING because of non-vaccinated people! 

There is no longer any excuse for being so self-absorbed or even skeptical or uninformed without also being held personally accountable for the continuation of this deadly pandemic.

Yes, non-vaccinated people should be thoroughly ostracized through federal & state governments decisively taking whatever measures are needed to save lives! 

Yes, I am very angry."

Being angry at whatever and whoever you feel is the boogeyman isn’t giving you any more tools to avoid the virus: wearing a mask is. We must stop blaming and pointing fingers at each other; everyone is lacking in something someone else deems necessary. If you are so worried, take responsibility for your health which means at least adhering to guidelines the CDC and local health authorities set out and keeping yourself out of harm’s way. From staying home all the time to simply wearing a mask and everything in between it is your choice."

For 40 years we have been propagandized to believe self interest is the only thing we need care about. How hard is it to understand that it is in everyone's self interest to have a healthy country? 

Or do that many of us just don't care anymore?"

 I do care most deeply for my very young grandchildren and all children too young to be vaccinated I struggle to care for any of  rest of us who can get vaccinated but refuse to. Their behavior has an outsize impact on the future of these children, physically, emotionally and educationally.
If these folks would self quarantine and only go out in public masked appropriately I wouldn't have be angry. If these folks felt and acted as if they were equally responsible to the members of their communities we most likely would have been out of lock down before June.  
At this point, I could care less about people economically hurting because they  or their peers prefer to be unvaccinated and maskless. What I care about are the lives of the vulnerable and though I do not have to I always wear a mask indoors in any public place and will do the same in any crowded outdoor venue.

I feel that she is completely wrong, and I know others do too, and giving such private details actually will put her at risk.

I want all private businesses to refuse service to the unvaccinated. I understand some people aren’t able to take the vaccine.

By that I mean making it mandatory to have a vaccination to ride any public transportation system in this country, or enter any public building including libraries, Unemployment offices , banks since they are insured by a government agency , and a requirement to produce a vaccine recod in order to receive any government benefit including medicare e. In addition, schools including colleges must require anyone entering the campus to be vaccinated and anyone 12 and over must be vaccinated to attend any school function. In addition a massive public campaign to again inform folks of the need for vaccines and science . 

Yes I blame those who refuse to get vaccinated and those late to get their vaccines for some of this surge but also for states and communities which allowed public gatherings and openings of restaurants and schools before it was safe . And of course those who pushed misinformation and urged folks not to trust the vaccines . And unfortunately Covid will be with us for a long time until we can get more that 85f% of our population vaccinated and help the rest of the world to do the same"

1. Our FDA is very good, and very strict (which is why there is ""medical tourism"" - people going everywhere from Mexico to India to get procedures and drugs not approved in the US). All such caution has been thrown to the wind here. 

2. Testing something new (like an mRNA vaccine) ordinarily lasts several years, through 4 phases (look this up). The FDA did Phase 1 and part of Phase 2. Like it or not, everyone that has gotten the vaccine is participating is a Phase 3 and 4 drug test. So far, the efficacy of the vaccines seems to be pretty good (though how long it lasts is still unanswered), but the medium and long term effects are completely unknown. 

3. In less than one year, we went from seeing the virus DNA for the first time, to producing a vaccine that has been given to millions of people. All sorts of safety protocols have been simply ignored in people's rush to get back to ""normal"". 

4. I am not an irresponsible citizen. I am still self-isolating. Do not go out in public. Get groceries delivered to my door. Still cut my own hair. Run my company from home. Get exercise by daily bike rides in a park. Am living in such a way that I will not give it to anyone. Will continue to do so until a vaccine I consider safe is produced. 

5. Angry that politics, emotion, and science are all blurred together."

Invincible ignorance- lack of knowledge that a person has no way to obtain. Vincible ignorance- lack of knowledge that a reasonable person I’d capable of acquiring by making an effort. Then there’s Nescience- knowledge that does not matter in the circumstance. That last one was kinda hard for me I needed some examples. But I finally got it. To me the article definitely stated one lesson throughout every individual is responsible for their own ignorance. I guess that’s why the law has always stated ignorance of a crime is no stance that you should not be punished. I’m not talking about rude ignorance here but rather an active avoidance of knowledge. I mean if a person chooses to be unvaccinated and with knowledge after doctors and friends due diligence then they have chosen to be a disease vector. Should I care for their suffering if they are disabled after their own choice/ignorance? One part of me says no but another does want to send empathy. They aren’t a victim of the disease rather a knowing participant."

This isn't a Hollywood movie. We have laws.

 If you won't obey traffic signals, you don't get to drive.

If you don't get vaccinated, you should not get to be where other people congregate.

Ms. Harris is behaving irresponsibly, possibly because she's young and ignorant. 

But there are millions of others who are older and should know better, but whose blind selfishness leads them to endanger their own lives as well as those of others.

A tougher stance is exactly what's needed. Just like laws."
2021-07-27 18:40:46,"I boggles my mind, why would anyone at any age say something as stupid as Shareese Harris, 26, has not been vaccinated and is “taking my time with it.” She worries that there may be long-term side effects from the vaccines and that they were rushed to market.

“I shouldn’t be judged or forced to make a decision,” Ms. Harris said. “Society will just have to wait for us.” 

So now society should have to wait for her and people like her, really. It's clear to me that her parents didn't teach her the definition of selfish. And she clearly doesn't understand the long term consequences of getting Covid, that if she contracted Covid she will sustain lung damage,  she could be one of the happy recipients of a lung transplant. If she thinks there may be long term consequences to using the vaccine, try getting a lung transplant, then talk about long term consequences. 

Youth is sometimes truly wasted on the young, I'm not particularly old, but I'm not 26, and even at 26 I would've been right in line as soon as I could get the vaccine. Becuase I've always been a believer in science and I'm old enough to have had a grandmother who was 19 during the Spanish Flu Pandemic in 1919. 

But it's people like Harris in this article who think that society just has to wait for her and people like her to get that warm fuzzy feeling and go get their vaccines. Maybe we should separate those people from society like lepers. Because that's what they are lepers."
2021-07-27 18:43:41,"I too am angry at those who refuse to be vaccinated. I simply don’t understand how the unvaccinated could be so selfish, putting everyone at risk.

The Delta variant is bad enough.  But Covid could mutate into other variants evading the protections offered by the current vaccines.  And the likelihood increases when large segments of the population remain unvaccinated.  

I’m worried about what variant comes next:  Epsilon, Zeta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Pi, Sigma, Upsilon, Omega.  Which variant will be the extinction level event for humanity?

Yeah, I’m angry at the selfishness - and idiocy - of the  unvaccinated.  And I’m very worried that they are dooming all of us."

The issue is a distorted sense of control. Control over their body equates to (in their minds) control over all the scary things life has brought them. Treating that fear and belief system is extremely difficult. And not quick. In the meantime, the coronavirus is mutating. Society doesn’t have time. Some form of mandatory vaccination must be enacted. Now."

So expressing deserved anger and frustration at the truculent, ignorant  and proudly health-endangering 30% of the country that will not get a shot is counterproductive?  Really? This vaccine has been universally available for more than 2 months now, and the ONLY reason the Delta is rising is the willful buy-in to scare-mongering and fabrications by those on the right (starting with a disgracefully high proportion of GOP folk) and some on the conspiratorial left (talking about you, Robert Kennedy Junior).

So we should offer crumpets and soothing talk and processing to those who believe the vaccine is a microchip shot from space lasers and that Biden ballots were swapped in from Venezuela and Iran?  Enough, already.

Maybe the same kind of gentle reasoning we should apply to those who refuse to wear seatbelts as they chug down a budweiser and race down the highway at 85 miles an hour, weaving lanes? Oy vey...

There has always been a 25-30% core of those immune to fact and reason, consumed with hate and myth.  Time to stop the gentle reasoning and start with vaccine mandates if you want to work or attend concerts, sporting events, etc...

It's easy to believe that over 2.5 million Americans will die of covid between now and next summer.

This easy-to-believe scenario is what the path to herd immunity among the unvaccinated looks like.

Just imagine 168 million unvaccinated Americans, maybe 80% of them have to get the virus to achieve herd immunity, that's 134.4 million of them infected.

If the mortality rate of the delta variant is 2%, then that would mean that just under 2.7 million more Americans will die of covid before herd immunity can be achieved.

That's 4.4 times the number dead so far.

Just imagine a new wave coming over 4 times the size of the last one.

The uninformed and unvaccinated here are unpleasant, but they didn't cause Delta. Worldwide greed and indifference to the suffering of the poor has been a bigger cause.

Last week I found that the owners of the spa were encouraging clients to enter their spa and receive work from me mask free whether or not they are vaccinated. Further, the owners and a few other staff believe the virus to be a hoax and the vaccine to be a conspiracy and that masks are bad for our health. 
Needless to say, I have quit. 2 hours in a closed room with 3 unvaccinated, unmasked people working hard while helping people recover from their injuries or stress during a couple's massage is a recipe for a break through infection. I am angry and am considered nuts to ""believe"" science and the experts. It may be in time I will be nuts because I am indoctrinated to read trusted and informed sources of information which are not at all trusted by my colleagues.

He's a book-smart kid with a full ride, and is moving off-campus in a couple of weeks. He's also an adult. I cannot force him to do anything, and wouldn't anyway, as I think this country has enough authoritarians opining well beyond their level of expertise. I referred to my unvaccinated fellow citizens as ignorant, while many of those replying argued that they were actually stupid. When will we learn that shaming and insulting never changes minds, and, in fact, actually leads to 'those' people clinging even harder to their misguided beliefs? 'Those' people are our neighbors, coworkers, friends, and family. I've lived in CO. Half my family is from NY and NJ. But the South is my spiritual home. I don't mean religion, I mean feel-it-in-your-bones home. Don't judge us for staying and trying to make it better from a blue state where your vote would be as little-missed as mine is in this red state.

Her son, an astrophysicist and a Canadian who volunteered to serve with the Israeli army, told her that mRNA vaccines killed every test animal that was exposed to it, although I don’t know which celestial body he’s living on because it’s not Earth. 

Right wing thinking is shown to be a dangerous social burden where it defeats obligations to each other. I understand working class anger because I’m working class and I have been angered by the top down system that oppresses our masses, but where affluent types are simply bucking society as a means of degrading democracy, my anger is redirected at them. 

I am a frontline worker, my wife is a frontline worker. Together, we battled the pandemic through overcoming our fears and going to work, risking what we must. We’re now both gladly fully vaccinated with mRNA doses with no effect on our immediate health.  Even if there is a risk to health through vaccines, our obligation is to still take it.  We ask our country and our community what we can do for it, not the opposite. These right wing misanthropes do the exact opposite and I’m sick of them.

We have followed all the rules since March 2020, worn masks, washed our hands, kept our distance, got both doses of vaccines, and remained vigilant.


What exactly have you done to protect yourself, your family, and mine?

The research is pretty clear related to vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Many of us have had enough. Many of us gave people like you the benefit of the doubt.

No longer. 

Do your homework, listen to the experts, and think whether any of us will give a flying fig if you require hospitalization. Think about your family…their heartbreak, the medical debt you will leave them, and how you will be remembered….ie a person who thinks only of herself.

She then claimed that a stem cell line which originated from an aborted fetus in the 80!s was used in the research and development of the vaccines. These stem cell lines are thousands of generations away from the Petri dish manufactured cells of the fetus. Since she is a very strict Catholic I checked to see what the Vatican, as well as her church had to say. They said it is ones’ moral obligation to get vaccinated —  even the one using the stem cells.

How do you know who is unvaccinated? What is the California public health department thinking? What is the point of in person schooling if everything is going to be shut almost every week? My high schooler is extremely nervous about in person school. He is exactly like all of us adults, able to access and parse data for himself. How can I assure him he will be fine as Pfizer’s immunity wanes in the coming months?

The FDA is making a huge mistake in delaying approval at least for all adults. The federal government needs to institute a mandate for both vaccines and masks.  We have too many greedy Republicans taking advantage of a gullible voter base. I’m tired of this over cautious approach towards safeguarding individual rights for selfish people. Biden does realize they did not and never will vote for any Democrat.

After a year and a half placating stupidity I’ve had enough.  Get tough. Insurance companies: no coverage for those who have chosen to cripple the nation by listening to Facebook instead of doctors.  If a healthcare workers are so craven they’d put their patients at risk just to own the libs fire them. 

Enough.  Get tough now."

After all, the virus is only innocently trying to physically infect cells.

Anti-vaxxers are literally trying to infect whole people—and not just accidentally; notice their demands to get everybody infected ASAP—and to infect them intellectually as well as physically. So I have no interest in screaming and throwing a punch, but gee whiz.

Those that refuse to mandate vaccination or weekly testing should be made to understand that they risk liability for negligence stemming virus transmission in the workplace or campus. That's more ""freedom of choice"" than the willfully unvaccinated deserve. The moment any vaccine is fully FDA approved, the weekly testing option should be dropped. No one has the ""right"" to drive drunk or without seat belts. No one who hasn't a seriously compromised medical condition has the right to endanger my life by remaining unvaccinated.

Now we have a near-miracle vaccine people are refusing to take.  They get sick, and these already exhausted workers have to treat them.  I imagine compassion is in  short supply.

While the govt. may not be able to issue a vaccination mandate, insurance companies can and should be able to say, at this point, no vaccination, no coverage.  Let the non-vaxers find out what an extended hospital stay costs.

Fortunately they had been vaccinated but all visitors are now required to wear masks which is a good thing. 

We learned yesterday a very sad story from a friend. A friend of their family who was eight months pregnant contracted covid. She was hospitalized quickly. They performed a C- Section. They baby thankfully survived. They mother was placed on a ventilator but did not make it leaving her husband with a two year old and a newborn. There is conflicting information in this state  from Physicians regarding vaccination of pregnant women. 

Contrast this info with her my daughters friend in Denver who was vaccinated and went into labor early. Mother and baby are doing well.

But I'm sad too, because there was no need to politicize vaccination.  After hundreds of millions of shots given in this and other countries, it's clear that the vaccine is safe and effective for the vast majority of people.  Those people should care enough about their neighbors who may be too young to be vaccinated or have an immune system problem to protect them by getting vaccinated themselves too."

We have the CDC cards that were given to us when we were vaccinated, and I have made scans of our cards. Is that the proof? My vaccination is in my medical record, but that is private. My wife's vaccination is not in her medical record because she got her shots from the VA where she works."

And they are refusing to do the two simplest things to end this pandemic sooner, even though neither is hard or even a true imposition. Throw in the fact that the Governor of my state stripped schools from the ability to require masks for the young kids who have no vaccine available, so yes, this all makes me angry, and my anger is justified because I have masked and sacrificed when necessary over the last year and a half and I have been vaccinated.

The author is suggesting that maintaining open dialogue with these people leaves open the option of persuading them with reason. It does not. The reasonable argument has already been made, and they rejected it.

I don't think we should be coercing people to get the vaccine. I do think we should be denying them services and privileges when those services and privileges might put vaccinated people, or the children of vaccinated people, or people who cannot be vaccinated, in danger."

There are so many people who are focused on their rights that they have forgotten that those rights come with responsibilities.  We all have a responsibility to protect those around us - particularly those who are the most vulnerable, in this case, children, the elderly, and the medically fragile/ill.

They had no idea who would get it, or why, and since it had disappeared by Elizabeth’s reign the cause remains unknown to us. But our sciences would have found that cause, probably a virus, within weeks and attempted to devise an inoculation against it. And we do happen to have a dangerous virus going around lately, even if a bit less dramatic, and there is a vaccine. People missing their Covid shots is stupid."

It is amazing though, so many stupid persons, idiots we have in this country.  It should be a policy that anyone objecting to be vaccinated and get the Covid should pay for their own hospitalization and the policy should be publicly addressed.

In order to end this I believe the feds need to bite the bullet, take the heat and force this into the arms of every eligible citizen. Those who chose to do their part have a right to be free from those who would do us harm by exposing us to a deadly pathogen. Shame on those who will not do their part to save themselves, their families, their communities, healthcare workers, etc. These selfish people are silently and invisibly murdering us and destroying our livelihoods. 

Prior to a mandate I believe the government needs to take a strong stance against everyone who intentionally lies about the virus. Sue them for civil damages! Please also implement a national vaccine passport system and don't allow anyone without one into any indoor public places or transportation. Please remove all Covid-19 related support from those who will not vaccinate. Please force those who will not vaccinate to cover their own healthcare costs and the costs of those they infect.  Please emphasize that it is everyone's patriotic duty to do their part to save themselves and the country by getting vaccinated. Please don't wait for 100k more to die. Please act now!!!"

Businesses and public spaces can give them special Covid-spreader areas, away from every one else, so they can exhale their disease amongst themselves.  To get into the healthy zone, they need a Covid vax card.  If businesses want to attract the disease-spreaders, they could advertise that they permit spreaders, just as some tout that they allow smoking.  Conversely, healthy places could attract normal people by touting ""no Covid-spreading allowed, vax card required for entry"".

As with smoking, the spreaders would either learn to enjoy their own company, apart, or give in, or die."

They can read for themselves the percentage of the hospitalized and dead that are unvaccinated. My empathy has expired.

Now it comes down to individual responsibility. You either altruistically chose to to vaccinate to protect yourself and your surrounding community (including the immune compromised  undergoing cancer treatments), or you make a selfish, nihilistic choice to be both a vector of disease and an incubator of disease mutation, jeopardizing the lives of the vulnerable.

We've had a live and let live approach to this in the past, but now, the groups who are refusing this vaccine are not hidden away in a rural village or protected urban enclave, instead, they walk daily amongst us, and that is frightening. When your ideology or religion threatens the lives and health rest of us, it should no longer be a protected belief.

For those anti-vaccine fools the carrot approach has failed.  It's time for the stick.  Increase medical insurance premiums on the unvaccinated and deny them health insurance benefits for any Covid-19 medical treatments as well (excepting those with valid medical reasons for being unvaccinated).

It is the same argument used to further the tobacco industry. We established that, while not everyone will suffer from nicotine, the science is conclusive that many if not most people will react negatively to smoke, some will even die, even if 'only' secondary inhalation.  Therefore it is unreasonable to allow those who don't smoke to have the potential of illness imposed on them by those who do smoke.  
Equally while many or even most people will not be harmed, at least seriously, by smoke or covid, it is reasonable and fair to keep those who might harm others away from public venues without agreed upon measures.
It's a choice but that choice does not allow for the potential of harming others in public settings. And businesses, as with smoking, must protect their workers and clients from smoke inhalation ... and covid.

I got Covid because my elementary school refused to shut down, even when there was at least one positive test of students or teachers every week for the entire year. It just kept spreading.

I got COVID because even though everyone was required to wear masks at school, a lot of families, and even teachers, didn’t bother wearing masks outside of school.

If I’m going to expose myself to that risk again, I want to know that children’s families can’t cause me to get sick, maybe worse this time, because they’re so selfish.

Those wearing masks were the employees; and among the customers, a few responsible 30-50 year-olds, and most all the seniors with a few exceptions.

But I came to a conclusion that I am at peace with.

A global crisis is like being on an airplane. Here’s the thing about being on airplane: you have zero control over the situation. You don’t have as much control as you think you do riding in any other conveyance, either, but there’s something about being five miles above the ground that effectively erases any lingering delusions. In the end you really have no choice but to trust the pilot and hope the mechanics did their job in the pre-flight inspection.

I know, you have a choice whether to buy an airline ticket and no choice about how the Powers That Be are managing the pandemic. But the time to register an opinion about who’s running things and how they’re being run and fighting for structural change is long over. The world is probably not run the way you want it to be. You could have made a difference by paying attention to what’s going on in the world and mobilized with others to do something about it.

2021-07-27 15:18:38,"For those who want a sober but highly informed opinion on these issues I recommend the interview linked below to Dr. Robert Malone. 

He is the co-inventor of the mRNA vaccine delivery system. With that credential you can see he is certainly not an anti-vaxer.

But he's a cautious scientist and a bioethicist and he has concluded that recent tests on the Moderna vaccine reveal some troubling behavior of the spike protein that were not expected in the original design.

This doesn't mean that the vaccine will cause problems down the line. But it does mean that we don't know whether it will or won't.

Bioethics rules suggest that until we know more about that issue that we might want to pause the current vaccination effort to insure the public that there is no problem.

Simply put, the rush to develop these vaccines did involve some cutting of corners and came up short of what the FDA would normally require.

Under these circumstances we should know more before establishing a vaccine mandate.

I am sorry you took that risk and got little benefits in return, but that was your personal decision that you hoped would personally give you immunity and let you go back to normal life. My own decision is that I am waiting to see the long term effects the vaccine has on the early adopters, the effects on the pandemic (the rise of vaccine-resistant strains) and the optimization of the dosing and time between doses."

2021-07-27 18:15:31,"Let's be entirely clear:  this is a massive moral and cultural failure.  Almost half of Americans are fantastically selfish and irresponsible, and the only way to get them to ask responsibly is to force them to do so.  This is why we need strict regulations and enforcement.  To be honest, I see no objection to requiring vaccinations and rounding up the refuseniks and firing them, barring them from public places, or even putting them in camps where they can do only limited harm to others.  There is no reason people who act like adults should put up with these people placing their families in harm's way.  No one has a right to endanger others through their irresponsibility."

One of our members complained about this--calling us government zombies, etc.--and we just told her she would not be welcome until she was vaccinated.

Some of our members have had cancer, are taken chemo, or have health conditions that would put them at risk. I cannot believe the selfishness and sheer evilness of this woman's stand.

Oh, and of course, she's considers herself a big ""Christian."" And we can't unsee how horrible she is now--none of us want her back."
2021-07-27 14:46:28,"""experts warn that punitive measures and social ostracism can backfire...

Elected officials in several Los Angeles County communities, for example, are already refusing to enforce the county’s new mask mandate.""

The author draws a conclusion that is inconsistent with the article.  Vaccine mandates and the new mask mandate are two very different creatures.

Even though I was fortunate enough to be one of the first to be vaccinated, I had no problem with the old mask mandates. Until the vaccine was available to all, it made sense for everyone to be required to wear a mask.

But now the vaccine is available to all, and the only reason that the County felt it needed to impose a new mask mandate is that selfish individuals refuse to be vaccinated.  That does make me angry.

Regardless of mandates, unvaccinated people are less likely to wear masks (selfish people tend to be selfish), so they will continue to spread the disease among themselves.  

So the effects of the new mandate will be to penalize vaccinated people who follow the rules by making their lives more difficult, inflict further damage on small businesses (such as gyms) where mask wearing is a problem, and disincentivize selfish people from getting vaccinated.

I'm also concerned that when this measure proves to be ineffectual, more stringent measures (lockdowns) will be imposed.  

The only solution is to prevent those who cannot prove that they have been vaccinated from interacting with society."
2021-07-27 14:44:49,"WHILE ANGER AT THOSE WHO CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE TO REMAIN UNPROTECTED By refusing the COVID-19, it's a good idea to calm down and encourage the unvaccinated with support and understanding.  I experienced moderate side effects after both injections.  Unpleasant, but bearable.  I found the vaccine for shingles was the most intensely painful I've taken.  While it seems counterintuitive, I believe that if another idea that will cause anger is introduced, it may help a significant number of the unvaccinated to change their minds.  Specifically, if the are told that they'll be in a high risk group and that their health insurance premiums will increase by $30 to $40 per month, they may decide that it's easier to get vaccinated than to pay between, $3,040 and $,4080 dollars per year.  Individuals have the right to decline vaccinations.  Healthcare providers (i.e., insurance companies) have the right to increase fees for persons who choose to remain with elevated risk factors that could be resolved by taking the vaccine.  It's both a double bind and a negative reinforcer, in behavioral terms.  The combination is pretty persuasive!"
2021-07-27 14:09:46,"Yeah, and it is the same deniers who caused the failure on the climate crisis. I've lost all respect for the government over them. You, the New York Times, have been far too accommodating of late. We need facts from you, not fluff, or attempts to shore up the status quo."
2021-07-27 12:12:42,"What makes CV19 so insidious as a virus is that ~95% of the population will never get significantly ill.    

This fact provides these anti-vaxers the luxury of their nonsense.  

Trust me on this: 

If Ebola was the virus spreading across the world--whereby most infected die a painful death via bleeding inside out through all one's orifices etc.-- rather than CV19, these same rediculous people would be fighting each other for the vaccine.

Mandate the Vax"
2021-07-27 20:08:41,"Natural immunity should count the same as a vaccine does. And for those of you who continue to spread false information about immunity gained from natural infection:

There are more as well if you just look. 

I'm not saying this is any sort of viable path to herd immunity for those who have not been exposed or infected already - they should get the vaccine. But for those of us who have already recovered from the virus, it appears there is little need to hyperventilate about our vaccination status. If proof is what is desired, then set a threshold and require proof of antibodies for an equivalent immunity pass/vaccine card."
2021-07-27 20:15:46,"the idea that the Covid19 vaccine perhaps contains a chip in it or that it is a political statement is so far fetched to me, I can't even subscribe to it.  I am a Republican, yet apparently one that can think logically.  It is as if you are being shot at but wearing a bullet proof vest can save you yet you will not wear it out of the belief it won't help.  Even if it help 10% I'd wear it and so it is with this vaccine. Perhaps you believe  it will not protect you but if it protects you 5%, that's 5 percent more protection than you have now.  Come on folks, this is insane. People around the world must think we are crazy and it would seem that we are .  Just get a vaccine and be done with it.  It is not logical to attribute it to a political or other cause. Just  get the vaccine, quiet up and go on with your lives especially now that you are vaccinated and have a life to live.  without it, you are rolling the proverbial dice and the house will be against you"

2021-07-27 20:23:21,"My husband and I Pfizered up in January. Even so, given the delta variant, we continue to wear masks in indoor public spaces so as not to unwittingly infect those too young for the vaccine.  We have committed ourselves to fulfilling our civic and personal obligations to family and community. Now we have to swallow the absurdity of adults who need to be coaxed and rewarded into doing theirs? How did this country get to the point of having to sweet-talk adults like recalcitrant toddlers: ""if you eat your green beans, we'll buy you a pony!"" I'm frankly sick of these ignorant and selfish Americans. They are the ones who are spreading the disease by giving fertile ground to the emergence of variants. Come on, people, step up!

2021-07-27 14:54:02,If we have the tools to determine exactly who spread the virus and they have no fatal excuse for not being vaccinated we should be able to sue them for everything they got.
2021-07-27 15:59:32,"Access to any sort of place were people congregate (restaurants, bars, public transport, concerts, etc) should be made contingent on showing proof of vaccination.

2021-07-27 20:00:24,"The stance of the unvaccinated is not only idiotic, it is selfish in the extreme, and pernicious. They are endangering the entire nation by their incredible refusal to protect themselves and the rest of us. I am aghast at even the people who have come down with the disease and are at death's door screaming about ""freedom."" Well, people don't have the freedom to infect other people. Think Typhoid Mary.  Think STDs. Public health officials have every right to make sure that these clueless people not constitute a public danger. Soon there will be lawsuits, and deservedly so."

My husband is immunocompromised.  I have no patience left for the unvaccinated.  I considerer them selfish and self-centered, and if they are hospitalized they are wasting resources from a preventable illness.  I believe we need to move to a model like China where if you test positive, you are removed from your home and forced to quarantine to prevent further infection since we have such a large unvaccinated population."

They seem oblivious to the side glances given for their self-centered choice — or they pretend not to realize that the fully vaxxed are still wearing masks because of them. It’s all I can do to avoid eye contact. I’m so over this pandemic."
2021-07-27 19:39:11,"I share their anger.

Not only do we have a good part of the nation recalcitrant, the ""nobody tells me what to do"" crowd, we have a epistemic problem, i.e, everyday people do not understand the nature of a virus.

A virus is an obligate intracellular parasite.   It needs a host.   It needs a human (or other mammal) to reproduce.   If we cut off access to humans through vaccines or masks or quarantines, the virus leaves the population and is no longer an endemic threat, propagating and mutating.

Hence, if you are not a victim with a mortal case, you can still be a vector of transmission that renders others extremely ill.    In addition, if you are unvaccinated you can be part of what immunologist call a ""reservoir of contagion.""

This reservoir allows the virus to hang around in society, causing illness going forward, in addition to being a big drag on the economy.

We vanquished terrible virus diseases like small pox, polio and rubella with vaccines.    Perhaps part of the problem is that people do not remember the bad old days.

Moreover, perhaps Covid is not bad enough.   ""He recovered; she recovered;  nothing that bad is going to happen to me.""

Alas, perhaps not.   But you may be a vector of transmission to someone mortally vulnerable.     And in the process, you inhibit the rest of us getting back to normal.

There should have been a ""Jurassic Park"" animated short to show everyday people how a virus reproduces.   Americans do not apprehend the Covid virus as a threat."
2021-07-27 20:19:49,"It's not just the refusal to get vaccinated -- it's the refusal combined with the insistence on remaining out in the world. You have a right to determine what goes in your body, sure (even though most medical professionals think that's a terrible decision), but then I expect you to self-isolate and keep your disease vector to yourself."
2021-07-27 19:20:32,"Yes, I am angry.  I was vaccinated the first week I was eligible.  I always wore a mask when I went out for over a year.  I spent the holidays last year all by myself because my family lives elsewhere, and I did not want to risk infecting any of my friends in town.  And now, when we should be coming out of the pandemic, we are not because of stupid conspiracy theories pushed by elected members of Congress and some people in the media.  I think people who refuse to be vaccinated should be precluded from flying, be banned from restaurants and theaters, and maybe lose their jobs."

2021-07-27 19:41:46,Fully vaccinated!  I support!  All good!  I have a question.  Does the vaccine’s “emergency use” authorization from FDA preclude it from being made mandatory by public institutions?  I know we have a federal mask mandate for public transportation.  Is there an end run around the right-wing governors?
2021-07-27 20:36:51,"Unfortunately, many people struggle with making decisions based on accurate relative risk assessments. My 26 year old brother-in-law is hesitant about the vaccine because he's worried about the risk of blood clots. His chances of being hospitalized from COVID are higher. His chances of being hospitalized due to a car accident are probably higher, yet he doesn't think twice about hopping in the car. 

At this point, if you choose not to be vaccinated for anything other than a valid medical reason, insurance should not cover medical expenses should you then get sick with COVID. You are a hazard to your community and we should not have to pay for your irrational choices."
2021-07-27 19:01:32,"The bottom line: if you are not vaccinated you are a potential carrier and should be quarantined until you come to your senses and get vaccinated. This is not a personal decision. It is a public health necessity, and your personal liberty has to take a back seat."
2021-07-27 19:19:37,"Welcome to the U.S.A. where the law abiding, vaccine compliant residents are punished by reinstated lockdowns and mandatory masking while the criminals and unvaccinated population are encouraged and allowed to do exactly as they please. Isn't life just GRAND."
2021-07-27 20:33:59,"Yesterday we ran into a neighbor who claims to be a life coach. I asked her if she was vaccinated. She said no. I just turned my back and walked away from her. If I see her on social media, I will alert her clients to her status. But honestly, why should I do the work of the government for it? I pay high taxes so the government can protect me against public-health emergencies, crime and other social threats. However, in California the government has apparently decided to outsource its primary responsibility of protection through coercion to private citizens, while they are busy letting criminals out of jails and renaming schools. France and Israel have instituted vaccination passports. California should do the same, and let people like this “life coach” lose their livelihood. This will quickly change the equation."
2021-07-27 20:39:21,"Are the vaccines entirely risk free? Of course not. Are the risks even to compare to the risk of contracting COVID to the harm of oneself (including potential death) and/or to family, friends, neighbors, and strangers? Absolutely not. My father and his brother took on FAR greater risk when they went off to WWII, serving in harm’s way, including combat in my father’s case, in a PT boat in one uncle’s case, and as a medic in the other uncle’s case. If you refuse to take even the infinitesimal risk of being vaccinated, you don’t truly love your neighbor and you are not patriot.

Trump supporters have been primed over a period of years to be particularly susceptible to wanting a certain look. Fox ‘News’ and their like could probably get them to start smoking cigarettes again if they tried.

Of course rational thinkers are disgusted. And they call us snowflakes. Fortunately for me, I never gave up the mask. I live in an apartment building where I have to share the elevator with one of these Covid-deniers. He’s a nice guy, but I don’t want to breathe in what he’s breathing out.

This is unproductive to say the least.
Since stances have long since crystallized it would serve to explain them, rather than demonize them in a sort of “preach anger to the coir” fashion. Sure, you can score easy points by getting people upset at people of different viewpoints, but except for selling papers you achieve practically nothing.
A more wholistic discussion of the challenges we’re faced with may encourage a healthier discourse.
I am not vaccinated, only against covid - I have every other shot out there, because I feel it’s unnecessary if the risk group has had its shot. I also disapprove of the pressure to get it.
No one can convince me to get the shot, and this sort of article’s only achievement, in the end, is to create tense situations around the dinner table.
Let’s not go there, it doesn’t contribute anything to our lives."
2021-07-27 20:11:47,"When will we stop blaming unvaccinated people for the virus spread? It's clear that the delta variant has been spread in large measure by the vaccinated people running around maskless. Many unvaccinated people have persisted in wearing masks throughout, have not been infected by COVID and are not spreading the virus. This is down to individual responsibility and decision making. It's been known from the very beginning that viruses mutate and that they will find the path of least resistance. Is it a masked unvaccinated person or a unmasked vaccinated one? Stop the blame games."
2021-07-27 19:27:43,"What angers me most is the cold, cynical political calculation of Republicans and right-wing news media pundits who are discouraging vaccination because:
- They know low vaccinations rates will hamper our COVID recovery, both in terms of new cases and economic recovery as people can return to full employment, and
- That will reflect well on Biden and the Democrats, who have promoted vaccination and got vaccines out to most Americans via a herculean effort after a disasterous transition where Trump left no vaccines in the pipeline.

It's infuriating that one party cares so much about staying in power and enabling a corrupt president to regain power that its leaders are willing to incur tremendous costs in terms of death and ecomomic misery for all Americans. 

So, yes, I'm angry. And I'm also losing hope that the saner Republicans will work with Democrats to stop this result."
2021-07-27 20:22:03,"How about us, the vaccinated?  Perhaps we should file a class action suit against the unvaccinated, as these delusional individuals appear to claim a right to infect other people.  Surely, as the most litigious nation on earth, someone, somewhere should file suit.  This is a public health crisis.  The negligance and ignorance of the unvaccinated is criminal."
2021-07-27 19:40:46,"Anger?

How can I be angry at Americans who are misinformed by Fox News and right wing politicians?

 I am not angry.  I am disappointed that the vaccine and masks have become a political issue and not a clear health issue.

 The Lincoln Project has done a good job of placing blame on the right wing politicians and journalists who are behind this   unfortunate and deadly ruse."

2021-07-26 18:57:47,"Once the FDA approves the vaccines, they should be mandated in all public schools and universities and for all government workers. I also hope insurance providers will start raising premiums for the unvaccinated. COVID-19 now is a disease with a safe, effective and free treatment available to all. Enough already."
2021-07-26 18:59:45,"For the life of me, I don’t understand how ANY individual who works with individuals in the healthcare field, albeit Veteran Affairs, hospitals, clinics, blood banks, etc. are NOT vaccinated.  They are working with and providing care for individuals with health issues.  Isn’t the very last thing any patient needs is a medical professional NOT vaccinated?

Last month I went to give blood.  NONE of the individuals working there wore masks.  No one asked to see my vaccination card and when I offered to show it, no one was interested in seeing it.  What in the world?  Granted, the vaccinations are 90% effective, but there is still that 10 percent change that someone could get COVID.  

So many people are carrying on as if this pandemic is gone or quickly disappearing.  Not even half of this country is fully vaccinated.  I would think/hope/expect ALL facilities working with individuals, especially in the medical profession be fully vaccinated.  How do they NOT see that as an oxymoron – not being vaccinated and yet giving medical attention to people who are ill?  

Isn’t the main reason why the Delta variant is gaining momentum so quickly is because of that 51% of Americans are NOT vaccinated?

Thank you V.A. for mandating health care workers to be vaccinated.  My brother goes to a V.A. hospital by him.  I know this will be a great relief to him and to me."
2021-07-26 19:00:41,These vaccines need to be fully approved so private companies can make getting vaccinated required. My firm is currently unwilling to mandate this until either the CDC updates their guidelines or the vaccine is moved from emergency authorization to fully approved.
2021-07-26 19:07:11,"I am a VA physician and strongly support this decision. Believe it or not, I know and work closely alongside several frontline healthcare workers who are not vaccinated for COVID-19, almost all of whom have chosen to avoid the vaccine as a result of misinformation and political rhetoric. I am very interested to see how this policy will play out, and I'm hopeful that we will no longer have as many unvaccinated colleagues as a result (either through attrition/removal or through improving vaccination rates). Still, the ""religious and medical exemption"" option has always been and will always be abused by those who are staunchly anti-vaccination. Time will tell. Regardless, I applaud this decision by our leadership."
2021-07-26 19:02:12,"I have been a volunteer at our local VA hospital for 11 years and only stopped when the pandemic hit and volunteering was paused.  Volunteers have been allowed back, with strict protocols but no vaccine requirements (they require flu shots, though).  I am fully vaccinated and will not be going back until all employees are required to be vaccinated.  Here in the south (trumpistan), I'm sure that will cause a huge reaction but anti-science, anti-vaxxers cannot be allowed to dictate the health of our country.  My neighbor actually works there and is one of the refusers. Because ""it's made from fetuses"".  You can't fix stupid, she should be fired. This is a good first step."

Then Pres. Biden  should mandate inoculations/ mask wearing   with  certain penalties for non compliance  enforced, for example, tax advantages or penalties, etc. Or use carrot or stick incentives.

Listen non compliers, you need licenses  to drive, own or run businesses, get married, etc.  Penalties for  speeding , not wearing seatbelts, etc. 

Of course "" I can't be forced to get injected"" is your choice but where other lives are being affected  people  need to pay for non compliance for  endangering the rest of the population.

We had a chance to beat down the corona virus, but spineless Republican obstructionism fueled by Faux and the GQP has torpedoed that change, and now we have a super bug on the loose — the delta variant. It won’t be too long before we all have to mask up again — and with much better masks than we’ve used before. Still no mask for “stupid” though."

2021-07-26 19:20:54,"President Biden must act now to mandate that all federal employees must be vaccinated along with all military personnel. Moreover, he should use his authority under the Interstate Commerce Act to require all those traveling between states by air, bus, or rail to be vaccinated and to have proof of it.  The latter can easily be accomplished by authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to provide vaccine passports for all who request them. We're in the midst of a preventable national public health emergency due to the unacceptable low vaccination rates in resistant red states where the highly contagious delta variant of the Covid-19 virus is leading to a dangerous uptick in hospitalizations and deaths when life-saving vaccine is readily available. The time for talk is over. To delay doing everything to mandate vaccinations is unconscionable and a failure of political leadership that risks setting back the economic progress made this year."
2021-07-26 19:21:04,"Honestly I think the government should require everyone (with the RARE exception of those who really can't) to get the vaccine. Or maybe some sort of tax incentive for those who do, an a penility for those who don't?"
2021-07-26 19:22:49,"Excellent. We cannot allow the science haters to endanger the health of every one else. At the same time, while Black and Hispanic pastors and community leaders should be urging their communities to get vaxxed, I also wish politicians would stop asking people in general to get vaccinated. At this point, the vaccinated are almost 100% protected from serious Covid illness. Other than the doubtful people of color, the only opposition is from the MAGA besotted, who are dug into their position, and any appeal to them only hardens their stance. Since t would be more effective for Covid itself to make the point by killing those who are opposing vaccination as a way of ""owning the libs."""

Good vaccines takes time. 

Good doctors in the VA buy good masks and the government should give good masks and not 10 cents masks.

If unvaccinated people contract the virus, they should cover their treatment. Their insurance companies are more than able to properly price their premiums and decide on coverage."
2021-07-26 19:26:28,As a veteran and a person who believes in the 'greater good' I can't believe how many healthcare workers are refusing to get vaccinated against Covid-19. I think everyone should be required to be vaccinated across the U.S. unless you have an autoimmune disease. Enough of this 'choice' business when we are still suffering from a lockdown in many parts of the U.S. because so many people refused to be vaccinated and people are literally dying or infecting others from their refusal to get vaccinated.

Joe Biden should have issued that order and an order requiring ALL military personnel be vaccinated on his first day in office.  Following Trump's ""Let's wait and see what happens"" policy is a recipe for further disasters, more deaths, and the rise of a variant that we won't be able to control with a vaccine.

Get on it, Joe. For god's sake, get on it."

Robert Wood Johnson Health Care System fired 6 healthcare workers refusing COVID-19 vaccines. It is time to use the stick.

We've waisted enough time counting on people to exercise good judgement.

Enough already, grow up. 

If you chose not be vaccinated, that's fine, but there should be measures to keep you contained.

1. No access to air travel or public transport
2. Insurance has right to refuse to pay for any treatment related to COVID
3. If you get COVID and need life support, you're last in line

2021-07-26 19:59:02,"Vaccine mandates sound so perfectly logical, mainly because the data we have at our fingertips tells us that the vaccines are exceptionally effective deterrents against hospitalization and death.

However, we have a virus that is incessantly spawning numerous mutants.  The latest and greatest is the Delta variant, which carries a viral load 1000 times more that the Wuhan version.  

Couldn't there be an even more contagious or evasive mutation in the near future?  After all, it took only a month or less for Delta to become the dominant strain.

And yet we're equipping our army of citizen-soldiers with a single weapon -- two similar mRNA vaccines to counteract the notorious spike protein.

We are commanding those serving our military veterans to do battle with a single shot weapon.  The strategy of ""all eggs in one basket"" seems a bit myopic to me.  Shouldn't we make better contingency plans?

From STAT News:

""The concerns stem from a phenomenon that is known as imprinting, sometimes called original antigenic sin ...

""... some scientists are concerned that the immune system’s reaction to the vaccines being deployed now could leave an indelible imprint, and that next-generation products, updated in response to emerging variants of the SARS-CoV-2, won’t confer as much protection.""

<a href=""https://tinyurl.com/245eaxbc"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/245eaxbc</a>

2021-07-26 19:59:27,"This is well timed.  I liked the way the Gov. of Alabama Kay Ivey put it when she said ""It's time to start blaming the unvaccinated.""  This kind of language works well in Alabama.  When the reporter asked what would work to get republicans to take the shot, she spat back: ""I don't know.  You tell me, what will work?""  This is cultural.  It had that, ""grandma knows and she's comin' for you"" vibe about it that you just don't ignore in the South.

Rolling out mandates is great wherever that would work.  It wont work in Shreveport, LA, but it likely will work on a federal and local level in many places.  Of course, there will be exceptions and fakers, but it does what it needs to without so much as a fine: It raises a bar and insists on a safe America. 

Employers and schools take note: This is a green light to begin."
2021-07-26 20:05:01,"I just do not get why mandating the vaccine, period, is so difficult.  Why does the unvaccinated get to risk the health of children under 12, the elderly, immunocompromised.

2021-07-26 20:07:12,"The strongest argument against getting vaccinated is that the vaccines aren’t yet FDA approved. I would grant you that this argument is almost never made in good faith, but most people can reasonably claim that they don’t have the education and background to critically evaluate all the evidence surrounding the vaccines, and therefore they’re going to put their faith in the FDA approval process. I find this line of thinking very difficult to counter.  What’s worse is that at this point, if FDA approval is seen to be rushed, it won’t be trusted anyway.  One could argue that most anti-vaxxers weren’t ever going to trust an FDA approval and it’s just a bad faith talking point.  In retrospect, I wish they’d gone for full approval from the outset and never used the EUA."

But what about the students? Full in-person learning in high poverty low-vaccination rate areas will be a disaster with this Delta variant. Covid vaccines should be added to the list of vaccine requirements for public schools. 

Indeed, vaccine requirements should encompass all sectors: private business, entertainment venues, gyms, restaurants, etc. It's the only way, before delta becomes epsilon and completely evades the vaccine which is less effective against delta."
2021-07-26 20:15:12,Most of the people who say this vaccine is not approved by FDA. Any vaccine created during  a pandemic is normally created this way. Do you people think Polio vaccine went through FDA approval before giving it to public.

To protect the American public as a whole, we need immunization of the vast majority of our population.  By now it seems clear that the only way to successfully end our nation's  regional wars over Covid  is to employ sweeping mandates.  It would be incredibly helpful if Mr. Biden, who got the vaccines to us quicker than any of us could have imagined,  would continue to make this a top national priority instead of relying on corporations and businesses to issue mandates as they see fit and where each locality can make its own rules.  After the remarkable initial success of the nationwide immunization effort, this is the next logical step.  Mandates will work, and the sooner the better for all of us!"

If you don't believe in science and medical research, how can you provide competent medical care? You can wait the last couple months for full FDA approval but pts will be dying. Why not go to the medical library in your VA hospital and look up the actual medical journal articles and see for yourself how good the research is? To get your degree in some kind of clinical field, I imagine you had to look up and read at least some clinical journal articles. Use those academic skills, go to your hospital medical library, and check it out for yourself, rather than rely on secondary sources like social media, internet, and reporters?"

Workers in healthcare settings were prioritized to receive the vaccine first to avoid contracting and spreading illness, particularly in vulnerable patient populations. 

They all should have been vaccinated months ago, and it says a lot about the delivery of medical services in this country that so many managed for so long to remain unvaxed."

Broad objective evidence is clear that vaccination saves both lives and keeps businesses open to save our economy.
This resistance to vaccination on the Unions part is just about as bad as police unions protecting all cops from disciplinary action, including Violent Abusive cops (the bad apples). 
Boy, it sure makes you want to be against unions even though we know they are saving the middle class."

It is now time for The Stick and it needs to hurt as much as possible.  

We cannot forcibly vaccinate people but we can absolutely make being unvaccinated very painful by requiring vaccine to enter anyplace people gather and even by imposing fines on the vaccine refusers.  

We settled that in 1905 when MA required small pox vaccination or pay a $5 fine.  Guy name of Jacob went all the way to SCOTUS to avoid the fine. The State’s compelling interest in stopping a deadly disease won and Mr Jacob had to pay the fine on top of the thousands he spent on lawyers to fight a losing battle against sanity and public health.  

Individual Liberty doesn’t extend to spreading deadly disease and wrecking the economy with irresponsible behavior.   

Get Vaccinated or stop going out in public."

Interesting that health care worker resistance to vaccines is between 30-40%- maybe they have reasons to be skeptical. Of course, health care workers are notorious for dictating what patients should do and then not following their own orders."

Each time she had normal vitals and was in no distress.  She needed reassurance, over and over and over.  How did she get infected you might ask?  She refused vaccination.

It is exceedingly rare that someone is more at risk from getting the vaccine than from potentially getting COVID, though I would of course defer to a doctor in that case. But religious exemptions? Religions are called faiths or beliefs because they aren't rooted in fact, and certainly not scientific fact. Doctors should say their religion is science, which prevents them from providing care to any unvaccinated moron who comes in for COVID treatment. Maybe if these folks know they don't have a healthcare system to fall back on they'll get vaccinated, or face the so easily preventable consequences."
2021-07-26 21:14:09,"Good for the VA. I hope this trend of vaccine requirements expands throughout the public and private sectors. 

I do not understand religious exemptions from getting the vaccine. Where in the Bible or any other religious text does it state no vaccines? I would think those who are religious who be the first in line: god or Allah or whoever you pray to gave humans the brains to create a lifesaving vaccine. Get it! It's a godsend! 

Also, in every religion murder is a sin. Therefore all religious peeps should want to ensure they are not a vector for death -- murder, manslaughter for knowingly speeding a deadly virus.

No religious exemptions."

2021-07-26 21:35:15,"I'm personally exhausted by the rhetoric of the unvaccinated as well as the ongoing threat of Covid because of this foolish and deeply disheartening misinformation campaign that a segment of our country has decided to accept as truth. It's now up to the vaccinated to start mandating limitations and restrictions on those that are unvaccinated whether it be at schools, health care facilities, businesses or our backyard barbecues and birthday parties if we are ever going to return to some normalcy. If you're not vaccinated, you do not have access. Those that are demanding their rights are somehow infringed by mask mandates and vaccines have forgotten that the rest of us are prevented from living 'freely' because of their choices.

But I thought well first the Federal government will mandate it in their healthcare system, and then other healthcare systems will too, and then will be the military, and then big private firms will start to, and the tourist industry will realize it is a selling point.  And etc.  If this is finally actually starting to happen (at the cost of a lot of lives let us not forget) then it's a good thing.  Let's just hope the rest of this list happens too.  The list this story links to of healthcare entities mandating vaccines is pretty long.  Also, the reason that they are granting these exemptions is because the EEOC told them they have to.  The VA does not have a choice here.  There are employers in Philly who are doing things like telling those who refuse vaccines to work in the basement. Or masks all day long so you can't eat in the office and weekly COVID tests.   You can legally harass people who say no and eventually some will say yes.  We should all hope that a tipping point has been reached."
2021-07-26 22:02:15,I don't understand the reluctance to mandate COVID vaccination. We require people to wear seat belts while driving or face a fine. Wearing or not wearing a seat belt has little impact on anyone other than yourself. Not getting vaccinated has an impact on many others including yourself. Mandate it for everyone unless there is a medical reason not to. No one has a religious exception from seat belt laws so forget that one.

White people have the highest vaccination rates and lowest amount of vaccine resistance of any race except maybe Asians.

The Republicans are concerned about the cycle of hoaxes, fake news and scapegoating that the Democrats use to create smoke screens to cover up their incompetence and failures.  The anticipated increase in Black unemployment from vaccine mandates will get attributed to systemic racism, legitimately, since the mandates clearly favor whites, then twisted to blame Republicans and white people for the outcome."
2021-07-26 19:07:06,"I think this a complex issue. But it makes no sense to mandate something that does not stop transmission. The US does not have good data on transmission but data coming from abroad, in particular Israel and England seems to suggest that both unvaccinated and vaccinated are almost equally affected by transmission. The logic they use to justify mandates is exactly that, its supposed to keep everyone safe. But that is not quite the case. It more likely effective in keeping you out of the hospital and or your death bed but its not a guarantee. And if they are going to mandate, will they institute a lifelong and or insurance fund to pay for death from the vaccine/or lifelong injury for employees that are harmed? From my understanding of the 2015 prep Act, it does not appear so. And they already have 70% employees vaccinated and or had natural occurring covid illness, that already meets the  threshold of herd immunity that was even stated by Fauci, et al. It makes zero sense."
2021-07-26 19:31:08,"First, I don’t understand medical workers in any health care setting not being mandated to get the vaccine. Second, I don’t understand why any medical worker wouldn’t have some knowledge of medical science that tells them getting the vaccine is a good idea. Third, the US Constitution does guarantee certain individual rights but it does not guarantee that you can always do what you want to do particularly at the expense of other people’s rights. We are all guaranteed the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But your pursuit of happiness can’t infringe on my right to life. That is why we are a nation of laws. Quite frankly an unvaccinated person refusing to wear a mask and keep their distance is a violation of my right to live. And “NO” it should not be me who should have to “stay inside because I’m afraid.” I’m the one following CDC recommendations so I can go outside and start living again. I made my sacrifices since March 2020 and I’ve been fully vaccinated since March 2021. Now it’s the unvaccinated’s turn to show that they care about this country’s survival and the right of all its people to go back to normal. And if they still refuse, the government should do something similar to what they did to TB patients in the 1960s. Then they placed TB sufferers into sanitariums to keep them from infecting the general population. Maybe the unvaccinated should also be put in isolation until the coronavirus disappears?"

2021-07-26 22:22:48,"It sounds safer to require masks and test everyone weekly.  The vaccinated can still become infected with and transmit covid and the variants just as the unvaccinated can.  This notion that the vaccine is a ""get out of jail free"" card is problematic."
2021-07-26 22:25:17,"It's astonishing to me that all Health Care Professionals aren't already vaccinated in the first place.


They have been educated with a science-based curricula and certified as qualified. Skeptical of science and vaccines equals unqualified to me.



Frankly, I don't want to be treated by Health Care ""vaccine skeptic,"" and am floored that their professional certifications aren't suspended until they receive re-training. It's about science, not what you read on the internet.


What's next? Health Care Professionals not sterilizing medical instruments because the are ""skeptical"" of bacteria?"
2021-07-26 22:30:49,"All Federal government workers should be required to be vaccinated. The exception being those with underlying health issues, which is a small percentage. I carry my vaxx card around with me. My son works for the Labor Department and he's been vaccinated. I would love a plastic credit-card like vaxx ""passport"" that could be updated when I get boosters. Every child should have a vaxx card. It should be the law of the land that all children must be vaccinated, or they can't go to public or private school. No goof-ball exceptions, like religious. If your some kind of goofy parent who objects to vaccinations, then stay away from the rest of us."
2021-07-26 22:35:09,Science and medical research of the Centers for Disease Control did not look at the delta variant and this is why the deaths of from the delta variant.  The only research of the Centers for Disease Control was to help more for the economy.
2021-07-26 22:38:06,"Come on President Joe, just what are you afraid of, political fallout from ""mandating"" vaccinations? I am more worried about getting sick and dying from the half of the population that is not fully vaccinated and spreading variants. I could not imagine going to the VA or any hospital and allowing myself to be treated and examined by a non vaccinated person. Just what do these unvaccinated health care providers tell heir patients ""let's see if we can determine what is wrong with you and by the way your visit here may have exposed you to Covid"". Enough with the excuses."

There have been over 300,000.00 shots and a comparatively minuscule amount of severe reactions or deaths.  What better odds can you find anywhere.?  You have fewer odds in your favor in crossing the street. The irresponsibility of the great majority of these people is incredible.  The people who really have valid medical reasons are a small amount and these are not what is preventing herd immunity.  I get annoyed at the constant references to ""confusion"" as regards the wearing of masks.  It's simply:  wear them when in crowds and with unknown persons.  It's no sacrifice, it's no inconvenience, it's no bother, especially when considering that they are protecting you from suffering or even worse."

2021-07-26 23:11:01,There are many possibly good steps to take. The move by some entities to require either vaccination or weekly tests is one of them. The only people who would ever object to both of them never did have a legitimate objection.

2021-07-27 01:23:22,"8 weeks to get inoculated is adequate time to willingly get fully immunized against COVID. Veterans who had COVID before should consult their primary care physician from within the VA system, as to whether their immunity has dropped or if the recovery has been 6-8 months after clearing the virus then a booster maybe worth taking to avoid facing penalties and possible removal. 
Veterans and seniors have to pay attention to other health problems that crop up during aging. To stay healthy, for starters they need to get checkups and the following age appropriate vaccines with almost no adverse effects. 
1) Seasonal Influenza vaccines, in mid August the vaccine against seasonal flu will start arriving in the pharmacies near you.
 2) Shingles 2 dose vaccine to prevent Zoster virus reactivation.
3) Pneumococcal vaccine to prevent some of the pneumonia. 
4) TDaP received once ever 10 years. 
5) HPV vaccine against STD to prevent papilloma.
6)  Yellow fever if traveling to certain parts of the world.
7) Malarial prophylaxis tablets if traveling to malarial areas.
8) Hep. A and E virus vaccines if traveling to certain areas of the world. Always check CDC.gov website for travel advisories.
9) Vaccine to prevent Monkey pox in certain parts of the world like DRC.
10) Rabies shot? Depends
11) Carry Insect repellents if traveling to places with insect borne viruses and parasites.

2021-07-27 17:08:45,"I think that it is fair for a vaccine mandate to be put in place in order to do specific things and continue working in certain positions. For example, I think that all doctors and nurses and everyone working in healthcare should get the vaccine because they come into contact with the most amount of people and it's a different person every time usually. Therefore, they have a greater chance to be exposed to COVID and the vaccine will protect them from that exposure and spreading it to other patients that don't have the vaccine yet."
2021-07-26 10:14:32,"This is a great idea. However, spillover from animals to humans is most likely to happen in Asia and Africa. We need to build and support facilities in those countries where such spillovers are most likely to occur. Currently they have limited capacity to test and sequence."

2021-07-26 10:39:55,"There is a fantastic - if frightening - discussion between Rob Reid and Sam Harris about the inevitablity of another pandemic.  

An important point they make is it is purely a matter of chance whether the next one has much higher mortality than Covid.  Comparatively speaking we got lucky this time round; Covid is serious - but survivable as a society.  Imagine for a moment what the world would be like right now if Covid had a case fatality rate of 50% and affected young people as much as the old.  It was just *chance* that this is not what we faced. 

We must learn the lessons and prepare for next time. 

On the positive side, Reid proposes a set of measures that would give civilisation an excellent shot at surviving even a far worse pandemic: one of his main recomendations is a moonshot project to develop vaccines for the most likely families of virus. 

This is pretty much what Fauci has now announced - so if interested I suggest a listen to this amazing podcast and perhaps contact your congressmen to voice support for this proposal from Fauci - and indeed the others put forward by Reid.  In comparison to the costs of Covid - the investment is a rounding error on US GDP.

2021-07-26 10:48:33,"A few billion dollars is a bargain. Set this aside the fact - and cost - of lost lives and the pervasive effect upon the economy of such viruses. If such vaccines can be developed, it is the logical, the moral thing to do."
2021-07-26 10:53:47,"This mess is never going away, is it?"
2021-07-26 10:56:29,"Right, by ""sheer chance"" scientists ""just happened"" to have spent years investigating the SARS-CoV-2. I would not call it ""sheer chance"". And the fact that the spike protein was subjected to ""tiny molecular changes"" in order for it to be ""held in one position"" is the very reason why some professionals ascribe a higher detriment to the spike protein produced by our bodies in response to vaccine, as opposed to the corona viruses' spike proteins. 

These ""tiny molecular changes"" are the addition of proline amino acids; the argument as to why this makes the spike protein more deleterious is based upon the fact that it, -- by virtue of the stability made possible due to these prolines, -- sticks to cell membranes instead of changing shape ""readily"", as mentioned in this article, and blocks the function of the cells and receptors. The receptors being, the ACE2 receptors and CD147 receptors."
2021-07-26 11:06:49,"It would have been helpful for this article me to wade into the gain of function technology debate. It’s tough to tell from this info if the work being done would be merely hypothetical based on modeling or if there would be a more active approach to manipulate viruses within a lab to anticipate an animal to human spillover potential that doesn’t yet exist. While I’m supportive of the former, the latter seems extremely risky. (And the discussion would be helpful regardless of where people want to land on the role of gain of function in COVID’s origins—I’m not sure there’s really enough info to make a decision either way.)"
2021-07-26 11:19:10,"“Expensive”? 

Compare to the cost of NOT having these vaccines available. According to Harvard, economists estimated that the cost of the 2020 pandemic to the US alone will be $16 trillion if it ends in the next few months. (And given the current state of the GOP and our ignorant populace, we’ll be lucky if it’s over by then.)

That is a cost of almost $3 billion per DAY for an 18-month pandemic. And that’s not even calculating the human misery and suffering this has caused.

So tell me again how your math works that you characterize a few billion dollars of fundamental scientific / health research as “expensive” to prevent the next one?

Yet the propaganda machine keeps churning because the Party cannot help taking advantage of people to advance the cause.

What will happen if the current strains morph into an Ebola-like killer?  

Show your loyalty: don't get vaccinated and don't wear a mask.

2021-07-26 11:36:21,"Sign me up now!  I love Fauci and can't believe he is still working at his age--what a role model of all of us, especially for the sloth who could learn more than a lesson or 2 from him!

I want to know if I should get a booster from Moderna, since I got Pfizer the first time around.  Is there any science on this?    My cousin, who is dating a med student, says he thinks we should rotate so that we get more anibodies from the different vaccines, but he will await the official word from the CDC before he gives official medical people.  I agree with the others here that the trick will be to actually get the booster.  There is no official list, so all of the people with claimed medical conditions will jump the line again, as will the fakes claiming to be teachers.  FOOEY on them."
2021-07-26 11:40:04,"I'm all for expending significant public funds to develop such prototype vaccines, so long as the resultant prototypes and techniques are in the public domain; that they have the status of generic drugs. Fighting pandemics is a global campaign, requiring not only ready but cheap vaccine production globally. Neither here nor abroad should human well-being be held to any degree hostage to the corporate intellectual property of an already bloated pharmaceutical industry. Readiness for the next pandemic should include readiness to mitigate the cost of global vaccination."
2021-07-26 11:41:45,"These needs to be done. We should be laying as much groundwork as we can so that the next time some virus comes along we at least have some knowledge to work off of making even vaccine development for novel viruses easier. Yes to science. Yes to government initiatives. Can we also pump more $$ into the development of new antibiotics? I know things like heart disease, cancer and diabetes are also important health issues, but in the long run, it is the viruses and bacteria that we really need to pay more attention to because they have the potential to decimate the species entirely. We need to prioritize this research, and, therefore, this funding."

2021-07-26 11:44:40,"I always thought the Covid vaccines were put on a shelf when Ebola became a bigger problem. So they dusted them off and voila we have two vaccines ready within a year and a half from the Covid lockdown. That’s pretty spectacular timing. With five years and a billions of dollars I expect there to be even greater vaccines. 

And, think of the other values to illnesses and afflictions that may be gained from this research. This would take our science to new heights. It would make our trip to the moon look small and billionaires building rockets for weightlessness look foolish."
2021-07-26 11:44:52,"We spend $800 billion per year on defense, and this proposed program is called “expensive”?  COVID-19 has cost the US and world economies trillions!  This sounds like a bargain to me.  We should also fund a huge increase in behavioral science research (psychology, anthropology, political science, economics, and sociology) to better understand vaccine hesitancy, the spread of misinformation, and how to improve public health communication and education in general."
2021-07-26 11:57:02,"It’s a fantastic idea, but like everything else, it would have to get past a Republican Party that’s anti-science, anti-Fauci, pro-“alternative facts,” and pro-conspiracy theory. Seems unlikely, when the party is actively opposing even the attempt to get people masked this time around.

And now, increasingly on the left there are anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers.

Our biggest threat is not microbiology; it’s the culture of militant unreality."
2021-07-26 11:59:29,"This is absolutely what should be done, but how will they get one half of the country to take them? They will need a concurrent strategy that starts now to fight the dissemination of outright lies that flows like toxic waste from Faux News, parts of Facebook, and from other news outlets and individuals.

They have all sorts of media and governmental powers to push their selective reading of the world as a biohazard. Trust me, if they make the “cure,”  they sure will be looking for the disease. You can find lots of things in the human body if you are determined to find stuff. Can we please live, not just stay alive??"
2021-07-26 12:06:21,"Well, expensive is in the eye of the beholder.   Given how much more travel occurs these days compared to a century ago, we can expect more pandemics.  This one, hardly the worst imaginable, has already racked up 4 million deaths, and 182 million cases.  The economic costs are in the trillions world-wide.  So, spending single digit billions per years sounds like quite a deal, even if we're lucky and go another century before a new pandemic."

2021-07-26 12:07:27,"Sounds like it makes sense.

Fauci is the ""poor man's Salk"". Salk set the gold standard on how to see a successful vaccine thru from beginning to end. He didn't have computers and it took longer but he eventually eliminated polio.

He had the skeptics, setbacks but plowed on like Fauci is doing.

One of the biggest pushes was when Elvis got the vaccine publicly circa 1958.

A leading conservative, even a Trump supporter can make up for their supporting an insurrectionist by publicly getting the vaccine like Elvis did back in the day."

It's more important even than climate change legislation or police reform or almost every other issue - not because those issues aren't important, but because our efforts to address them will be massively disrupted when another pandemic comes along, sucking up attention and resources and throwing everything into disarray.  The fact that we aren't already frantically working on something like this is simply ridiculous."
2021-07-26 10:54:58,"New viruses will happen particularly since people now aren't getting vaccinated so yes, we need to prepare for future viruses. And these vaccinations were started in 1995, only stupid people think they were created in one year!"
2021-07-26 12:22:43,"That is good news!

I think we also need to look at the process for authorization, for clinical trials, for testing safety with children. These are things that have taken far too long with the COVID vaccine, in my view. 

It’s nice to have a prototype, but if it takes five months for FDA “to review an application” and another 16 months for them to approve, I believe that an unacceptable level of speed. 

Companies have learned to move fast, with quality built into the process, and government need to catch up with process and efficiency improvements. In case of emergency, this should take days not years. How might we?"
2021-07-26 12:26:43,"We are lucky to have Dr. Anthony Fauci in charge of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  This idea to get ahead of future pandemics is fantastic and should be pursued immediately.  

On a related manner it must have been embarrassing to the citizens of Kentucky to hear Sen. Rand Paul's (R) cringe-worthy attempt to link NIH funding (and Dr. Anthony Fauci) to research at the Wuhan Lab, in order to implicate Fauci/NIH/USA for the Covid-19 pandemic.  Just pathetic. Sen. Paul found out that Dr. Fauci can handle himself when confronted with bold-faced Republican lies.  

The citizens of Wisconsin feel Kentucky's pain whenever Sen. Ron Johnson (R) speaks."

2021-07-26 13:07:19,"Dr Fauci is, of course, a national treasure and his vilification by those on the political Right is emblematic of the madness that is Trump-world. Dr Fauci  diplomatically contradicted the absurd statements made by the former President during the height of the 2020 pandemic and that was enough for some to cast him as an enemy
Still, he soldiers on, looking forward to future crisis that may well happen long after he retires, to better protect and improve the health and economic well-being of all Americans and all humans. THANK YOU Dr Fauci!"
2021-07-26 13:08:01,"It seems likely that Covid 19 came from a lab in Wuhan. It wouldn't be the first time that such escapes have happened, not only from China. It seems that scientists want money to study highly dangerous  scenarios - inventing potentially calamitous viruses in the name of research and not least for their own academic glory. It is not clear that they can be trusted to do so."
2021-07-26 13:08:31,"Yes, we should make vaccines for the next pandemic before it hits, but Fauci should not lead this program. America was ill prepared to a face a pandemic under his leadership even though many predicted it many years ago. After the death of so many people under his watch, instead of leading anything, he should leave his position.   

Fauci has been there for 40 years in his position and earning more than anybody in the bureaucracy, but when the corona virus hit he had no idea what to do. He advised wrong things in the beginning, not to wear masks, not to ban travel from China, etc. He said it would be a miracle if a vaccine is produced for covid within a year, but we produced it within nine months."
2021-07-26 13:07:32,"Ha, of course he does…..this pandemic is almost over and so is the need for his job…..

Too much money being made to let this virus go away yet!"
2021-07-26 13:12:17,"The science behind the COVID vaccines is indeed compelling, worthy of a Nobel Prize for its inventors.  The upside of the pandemic is that it brought to light an exciting new way to protect against a host of diseases.  

The US and all world communities would be foolish not to take advantage of this opportunity to work for the common good.  Lessons learned in the development and production of COVID vaccines can be applied to saving countless lives by preventing future epidemics and pandemics."
2021-07-26 13:22:35,This is a wonderful idea and makes so much sense ... that it'll never ever happen in the idiocracy that is the modern United States of America.
2021-07-26 13:24:45,"Since long-term planning is not a characteristic of contemporary human culture, if we don't start this immediately, we'll forget all about the risks of The Next One, which may well be a mere two or three years out. (For example, what about all those frozen pathogens now thawing as the planet heats.) 

As a rich and entitled global citizen, I can take my own personal precautions. Nevertheless, I won't be surprised if my last days involve horror-film style hemorrhaging or some other highly unpleasant symptom. (I'm already resentful of continuing, unnecessary limitations caused by political anti-vax sentiment as I start masking up indoors once again.)"

No plans to increase emergency PPE/ventilator supplies, no plan to save businesses from the stay open/lose everything dilemma, no plan to better encourage people to obtain safe medical care (including vaccines) or discourage misinformation, etc... The top scientists our nation has to offer represents one of the greatest strengths of our country. Thank you for everything you have done in the face of unrelenting resistance Dr. Fauci - your work has saved countless lives."

2021-07-26 13:31:04,There is no scientific consensus on where COVID-19 originated. One plausible scenario is that it was accidentally released from a research lab doing work intended to prepare us for future pandemics. I hope that is included in the risk assessment here.
2021-07-26 13:32:07,"The oral pill by Vaxart is the solution to this pandemic. They have demonstrated in clinical trials that it provides immunity most likely for years, has much higher T-cell counts than Moderna and Pfizer, and is cross-reactive to variants. There's a reason it's called the Holy Grail. It's shelf-stable, so Amazon drones can deliver to rural parts of the world. Just entering Phase 2 in Columbia. P3 will be in Latin American and India. The goal is to apply for a EUA next spring. Sean Tucker (Founder) has been working on oral vaccines for almost two decades, and he is way ahead in the game. Vaxart has also never failed a clinical trial on any product in their pipeline. I've been researching this company for a year - their pill is a disruptor to Big Pharma and a total game-changer."
2021-07-26 13:38:18,"Part of that money should be devoted to investigating non-biologic treatments, in other words, pills. The same tools that map out vulnerable sites on viruses, could, with the use of AI, be used to design substance that could just be ingested or inhaled, blocking their reproduction. They could be much cheaper and produced much more quickly. Right now, this program, laudable as it is, is just a gift to Big Pharma. The government itself should get in the business of producing these substances, sharing the technology with all nations."
2021-07-26 13:40:11,"Developing vaccines is expensive? How much does it cost to have more than 34 million people sick with covid-19? How much does it cost to have 610,000 dead? (Figures are from The Washington Post) How much does it cost to have hospital ICU beds filled? How much does it cost to care for people for whom the virus left them with organ damage, brain fog, and other permanent damage? How much did it cost to shut down the United States? How much did it cost to give supplements for unemployment and rent? How much did it cost to send $1,200 twice to everyone? 

Vaccines aren't expensive. Vaccines are cheap."
2021-07-26 13:40:27,"Fauci has sneaked in the funding for the pan-coronaviral vaccine already, which has a good chance of success - given the fact that the highly effective neutralizing antibodies cocktail from Regeneron (and some others) use essentially pan-coronaviral monoclonals isolated from patients who recovered from the first SARS in early 2000s. 
The problem I see with funding pre-emptive vaccine development is that if successful this project will entail either storing millions of vaccines time 20 (number of virus clades they target) or making agreements with big pharma to produce them on demand. With Covid-19 vaccines it took Pfizer months to start pumping theirs out, despite the fact that mRNA vaccine can be literally made in a bucket of T7 RNA polymerase. 
The more expedient, scalable, and stock- pilable option would be anti-virals. In the last few months we've seen what infusion of real structural, biochemical and molecular biological expertise can to the niche field of coronaviral studies. The disaster that is remdesivir deployment also showed everyone that relying on big pharma for discovery and innovation leads only to stagnation and patent fights. Billions reportedly spent by Gilead on remdesivir R&D failed to reveal that in addition to being a weak inhibitor of virus replication remdesivir acts as allosteric activator of the same (in sequence-dependent fashion) and that it can be used as off-target ATP analog by viral and human enzymes. More science, less pharma."
2021-07-26 13:43:00,"Nice idea, but good luck trying to get americans to take such a vaccine. Very few would take it, I am afraid."

2021-07-26 13:52:51,"Our hybrid approach to national health - public benefits, corporate  profits - is not a good environment for longterm projects.  Just-in-case investment is a hard sell without the prospect of immediate financial return. 

Just look at how we manage all of our other human and physical resources."
2021-07-26 13:53:07,"That’s a very good idea, and one that’s not unfamiliar to disease ecologists & epidemiologists who’ve been working on pathogen spillover but a great showcase of the science that happens every year in nearly every sub field under the radar without pandemics.

While the world has focused heavily on very few scientific discoveries (AI, quantum computing, CRISPr), the fact is that the breadth of science is what allows these civilization-changing breakthroughs. Countless disease ecologists venturing into the field catching rats, bats and more have been cataloguing the world’s viruses; veterinarians have been cataloguing the interface of sick domesticated animals & wildlife and people, and ecologists have been studying the mechanisms, from deforestation to bushmeat markets, that determine the abundance and distribution of viruses worldwide.

We know the story of the mRNA researcher whose work went under-appreciated for 30 years until her vaccines saved lives in a pandemic. The sad truth is, most academic scientists go under-appreciated for their entire careers despite painfully placing reliable and irrevocable blocks in our great pyramid of understanding. Part of the problem is the scientist-citizen interface, and part of the problem is a gross inequality among academic scientists with celebrity effects and privileged institutions out-marketing and drowning brilliant scientists at state schools.

Distributing fame, recognition, and funding will help us immensely this century."
2021-07-26 13:56:06,"Because I’m a life long germaphobe, I knew who Dr Fauci was and his amazing career of keeping America and the whole world safe. 
When the pandemic hit, I saw Dr Fauci take a role no other scientist could have endured yet he did. 
He kept working for all people all over the world despite Trump and his administration. 
Dr Fauci has dedicated his life to eradicating disease and when COVID 19 hit, he stepped up big time. 
Now, we need to show our faith in him by supporting this endeavor. 
I am admittedly a Fauci Fan. 
I got my Fauci Ouchie in Jan and Feb 2021. 
Rock on Dr Fauci."
2021-07-26 14:01:31,"Remember Bio-Shield? Stood up after the anthrax attacks in '01 and designed to provide vaccines against about 20 bio-weapons. When Ebola struck West Africa in '14, there was no Ebola vaccine. If vaccines were easy, we'd have them by now. I'm all for vaccine research but we've trundled this road before."
2021-07-26 14:02:06,"The latest data that I saw showed that the most common feature of those who have died during this pandemic are people with co-morbidities.

The most common of these are heart disease, diabetes, obesity related complications and high blood pressure.  All of these are not only treatable but in many cases preventable diseases.

When you account for these factors and leave out those over 70, the survival rate for covid is around 99.5%.

Vaccines may be useful for the most vulnerable, but for the rest of the population treating chronic disease is essential as a public health option.

The data also shows that while vaccine effectiveness is already waining, natural immunity from activated T cells seems to be strong and lasting.

We have become a pill culture believing that there is a simple relationship between any disease and a specific treatment. Yet, the most effective defense against the entire family of covid viruses is a strong immune system.

If we put our focus there, we won't need a new vaccine, except for maybe a very small percentage of the population.

Think of what we can accomplish by saving the billions being spent on vaccines and instead applying those funds to natural disease prevention."
2021-07-26 14:04:35,"""an ambitious and expensive plan to prepare for such nightmare scenarios. It would cost 'a few billion dollars' a year,"" the article says. This is hardly expensive. Ambitious, yes, but toward what end? The betterment of humanity, I would think. I do hope that the U.S. does go ahead with such a plan. A wise investment, indeed."
2021-07-26 14:07:47,"This makes enormous sense. We've now seen just how spectacularly effective and safe m-RNA vaccines can be. To do the background research that would enable us to create plug-and-play mRNA vaccines very quickly strikes me as a no-brainer.
I would be more than happy to see my tax dollars used in this way."
2021-07-26 14:09:52,"Countries will be doing a lot of work on pandemic response, and I'm sure that development of model vaccines will be given serious consideration. It's also now clear that pandemic response plans must have a strong international co-operation component as well  as a national component.

Each country's national plan has to focus on public buy-in and support for pandemic measures as the first priority. There have to be realistic expectations about the effectiveness of possible measures before and during vaccination campaigns.

In some countries, including the U.S., this has been the major stumbling block. One size is not going to fit all. To take an obvious example, it's clear that the U.S. and Canada, neighboring countries with many things in common, have completely different levels of public support for tough measures to deal with Covid 19. That's why Canada's fully vaccinated percentage went up 6.5% last week, and ours went up 0.5%.

I think that U.S. experts on pandemics did not anticipate, starting from day one, on how the American public would respond. The surprise is evident in video interviews with people like Sanjay Gupta and Tony Fauci. Initially, they clearly thought that the U.S. would have Covid 19 under control in short order. In their early comments about the response of other countries, there's a palpable tone of American superiority. Now they sound astonished and aghast."
2021-07-26 14:12:33,"Dr. Fauci, this is an important initiative.  As you know, public health impact is a function of both effectiveness (of the vaccines) and reach (in terms of how many people take them). 
Now call for a companion initiative to develop behavioral interventions to combat vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaxism."
2021-07-26 14:18:03,"After all the global sickness, death and social/economic upheaval of our ongoing pandemic, it would almost amount to criminal negligence not to take such proactive measures against future ones.  After all the whys, what-ifs and who’s-to-blames, this initiative should not only be funded and launched, but it’s yield should also be patently owned by the NIH and CDC. This would curb pharmaceutical firms from profiting from the negligence of public health by elected governments and appointed officials."
2021-07-26 14:21:21,I was under the impression there were mRNA vaccine candidates within hours of the release of the covid-19 genome by a Chinese scientist in early January 2020. Then there would be computer and lab tests to whittle down a few dozen likely protein segment candidates to a handful that would eventually be tested in humans. Hopefully this speed is repeatable in future epidemics.

2021-07-26 14:25:08,"I thought the time-consuming step in the development of a usable vaccine was the clinical trials, which take months to complete. Wouldn't this preclude using vaccines to control the early spread of the viruses?"
2021-07-26 14:26:46,"In the July issue of Scientific American magazine, on pages 22 and 23, there is a short article about the top 30 viruses that could spill over from animals to humans.  There is a web-based tool called SpillOver (<a href=""https://spillover.global"" target=""_blank"">https://spillover.global</a>/) that ranks the risk that various viruses will make the leap.  There are 10 virus families listed in the SciAm article, one of which is Coronavirus.  There is plenty of work to do targeting the others."
2021-07-26 14:30:40,"This needs to move forward with as great urgency as we had for the development of the COVID vaccine.  If for no other reason than that we've seen that the public can't be trusted to act in its own interest when their lives are in danger.  We clearly need to get to the vaccines first.  

It should be a top Democratic priority, too, seeing what little doubt we can have at this point that Republicans would refuse a vaccine developed ahead of the next pandemic, and would just choose to ""die free"" instead."
2021-07-26 14:32:13,"Which companies are the ones with the ""collaborative agreements"" to produce prototype vaccines?"
2021-07-26 14:32:37,"An interesting thing I've noticed in the comments. Conservatives have not engaged with the proposal or the idea at all. Instead, they are repeating talking points about Fauci. 

I find this emblematic of their whole approach. No objectivity or science. No self-preservation, even. Everything personalized. Everything ""own the libs."" They neither understand this proposal nor care to. Fauci has been designated by their leaders as an enemy of the tribe, so when he is mentioned, they all must boo and hiss, hiss and boo.

The US spends $2 billion a year on military uniforms. This vaccine funding would be a wise investment that will meet with obstruction by the right.

Much like what happened with investments for antibiotic drug development. It would've cost approximately $1.7 billion of investment to keep antibiotic drugs updated to battle drug resistant bacterial diseases spreading world wide. But all of that was scraped because it was too expensive. Thank goodness we have warehouses full of new uniforms."
2021-07-26 14:48:14,"I applaud this measure, and that our government should do additional: Form a pandemic preparedness task force. President Trump oversaw such a committee's dismantling, with tragic results. 

Such a committee should oversee tropical medicine research on the onset of such further pandemics--there will be more, no question. As humans continue to interact closely with animals (agriculture, wet markets, bushmeat, deforestation), there surely will be more pandemics. 

Our society would do well to become more vegan: We do not get viruses from plants; less land and water are needed for plant crops than for land animals; reduced methane emissions."
2021-07-26 14:50:15,"Let's hold off on one or two new air craft carriers.  Spend the money on more 'ship killer' missiles and technology and virus control.  US carriers are easy targets for the thousands of Chinese missiles.  As platforms for air attacks against miscreant nations and thugs, there are enough of them already and missiles can be launched from Frigates on up, from anywhere.  Instead of employing more ship builders, employ more scientists.  Big Pharma gets to make a lot of money.  The world stays ahead of the curve; and, humans begin to appear more intelligent.  Intelligence; that's the virus that needs spreading.  The US and the world needs to succumb to an intelligence pandemic."
2021-07-26 14:51:53,"This is a great idea from Dr. Fauci.  Better to spend a few billion to be ready for the next transmissible, deadly virus when it strikes, as it will.   I am concerned, though, that one of the main political parties in Congress  (you know which one) will drag its feet to supply the money if its strategists says that this funding will undermine them from winning control of government.  The theory, that good news based on reality  before the state and next national elections, will help the other party. 

This nihilistic thinking reminds me of that old sci-fi classic, ""the Shape of Things to Come""  from the 1930s.  There's a scene that take place in the rubble of a post-war Britain.  The head guy is called Boss.   Sudden a flying wedge airship  lands and a troop of ""Airmen""  gets off. The leader tells Boss that he is a representative of a new advanced civilization come to take him and his tribe out of their misery.  Boss understands that this will mean the end of his power.  He objects.  However, the Airmen pay him no mind and in the next scene, the entire world has been transformed and the human race prepares for its first journey into outer space.

He thought it was quite plausible, needing mainly a slug of capital. The idea has been backgrounded, has become this proposed collection of prototype vaccines. A universal vaccine is not mentioned here and I wonder why."
2021-07-26 15:04:16,"If this idea is shared and funded by all of the developed countries of the world, the cost would be easiliy borne by each country and the result will make for a much safer world for everyone.

If I remember correctly, some of his colleagues, Ian Lipkin, comes to mind had heard about a bad bug back going around in China in November of 2019. Why wasn’t the alarm sounded earlier? I think our money would be better spent being preparing in other ways, but I guess there isn’t any money in for him. This is our first recent pandemic. Asian countries (Singapore, Taiwan, Japan) have been faring way better during this time because they have experienced and handles other pandemics. 

Why are we going to spend billions/trillions when half of the population won’t take a darn vaccine? We need a multidisciplinary approach with many disciplines not just Fauci’s team."

2021-07-26 15:19:22,"Scientifically strong idea. And while a early warning system is desirable, it’s  irrelevant to Fauci’s proposal. Even if we had data on Corvid 19 in fall 2019, it would have little impact on the typical 4-6 year vaccine development cycle. The only reason the vaccines were ready in a year was they were built on the back of previous prototypes for MERS and SARS, and then the feds supported the ramp up."

Making vaccines is a relatively simple process, it is just like kitchen recipes, the main obstacle are patents' protection from big pharmaceutical companies which don't share their formulas.  I think the more scientists, lab technicians, college professors learn the ""know-how"" of making vaccines, the world would be much more prepared to a new pandemic. In fact, any drug dealer who owns a lab making illicit drugs, can manufacture vaccines, I bet switching to make vaccines and high priced drugs and medicines could be much more profitable and safer than making illicit drugs. these drug traffickers could become millionaires just like any pharma company"

2021-07-26 15:48:17,"40 years of profiteering by Big Pharma/ oligarch control of our economy has left the public ill-prepared to face the public health crisis of COVID-19. Because Big Pharma rarely invests in prevention, it has very little motivation to invest in preparedness for a public health crisis. Drugs for prevention do not contribute to share-holder value and profit. Instead, cures are designed once a public health crisis strikes. The sicker we are the more profit they earn.

The antidote is nationalization of the pharmaceutical industry, large increases in production of non-patent medications and ending monopolization by the Big Pharma industry. Drug companies should be converted to non-profit public service corporations that serve the public interest rather than being used by the 1% and oligarchs for unlimited profit. We need comprehensive reform in the way we produce new drugs including a public program for producing needed drugs and new non-patent medications that stay in the public domain.

Drugs would then be real social service items, not huge profit-producing goods for a tiny group of greedy oligarchs. With this new, fundamental reorientation of drug manufacture, drugs become affordable for patients, promote innovation, strengthen  safety and effectiveness. Because drugs developed and manufactured through new public pathways remain in the public domain, they could be economically produced generically throughout the world, benefiting many nations."

This reminds me of the story line of ""I Am Legend"", where a genetically modified virus-based vaccine which was supposed to carry a modification that would prevent cancers evolves into a virus that causes unforeseen and unintended consequences.  Science fiction?  Yes, but just perhaps, food for thought ..."

Well, if the lab-leak hypothesis of the coronavirus should prove to be true, then it was not ""sheer chance"" at all. 

Is Ms. Kolata biased toward the zoonotic hypothesis? 

An increasing number of scientists, politicians and ordinary citizens (left and right) are rightly saying that we should keep an open mind as to the origin of the virus."

2021-07-26 15:58:39,"If we can spend billions on preparing our military to fight adversaries and defend our citizens, we can afford to do the same to prepare for the next pandemic.  Especially given what the current one has already cost us."
2021-07-26 16:00:46,"While it sounds admirable, I’m cynical about anything done through the government. Look at the history with Emergent Biosolutions and the less than acceptable anthrax vaccine. Not only did they grab a lot of money, they effectively stopped more effective anthrax vaccines from replacing the old one. Emergent also bungled up the J&J roll out. The initial chaotic and contaminated covid tests, the hubris in not adopting Germany’s  protocols, or even those tests put forward by our own US universities. I sure hope Fauci has had an epiphany on how to advice on the execution of such future technologies. Certainly, Moderna is a positive step forward in all of this. So there is hope. Hopefully, they will hug Pfizer-Biontech and the incredible scientists onboard. The American scientific community is incredible and huge, so science will always move forward. Whether scientific advice will be adopted in time by politically motivated leaders of scientific establishments is a big question mark."

Right now, the greatest danger to COVID-19 patients may be a fungal infection. We saw this in India this past spring and, I suspect in earlier encounters with this bug.

We should also encourage a world-wide participation: America is not the greatest on mass-production. Legally, there should be indemnity if formulas are developed overseas. Believe me, third world manufacturing seldom matches that of Europe or the US: I've worked there. Oh, and I include China in that mix."

We know how to do it; it is what was done with ""Covid-19"" virus.  That is the beauty of that mode of vaccine development.  There are lots of virial candidates.  Time to get truckin'."

It's more proactive than any other virus-fighting proposal I've read about it, and it will allow the world some breathing room when a new virus is first detected. Even if it costs 25 to 30 billion dollars over five years, so what? This is something the mega billionaires should jump on and pool a small portion of their collective immense wealth to truly help save the world. I don't see how that can't appeal to their egos. And they could get a free pass on paying any income tax for life...oh wait, they have that already.

Why wait for a pandemic to occur to jump into action. A meatless society is healthier, more humane, more environmentally friendly, and would greatly reduce chances for mutations of viruses to travel from nonhumans to humans. This plan is the “vaccine machine” at work....money for more unnecessary animal torture in the labs for products whose use could be avoided."
2021-07-26 16:22:47,"Kudos to Dr. Fauci for this effort. 

But. 

Vaccines are necessary, but not sufficient for preventing the next 1918 or 2020 pandemics.  The causes of this and other pandemics are multifactorial, and require a multipronged approach, one that includes prevention of the problem on the first place, rather than putting out fires that we constantly seem to be starting in the first place.

When are we going to take responsibility for our role in creating these pandemics? Swine flu, HIV, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (aka “mad cow” disease), and likely COVID-19, were caused by our horrific treatment of animals.  <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/animal-cruelty-coronavirus.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/animal-cruelty-coronavirus.html</a>

Our cramming of animals in factory farms and wet markets is a set-up for the next pandemic.  If not via another zoonotic infection than by creating an antibiotic-resistant superbug.  

This public health physician is waiting for someone, anyone, to discuss this elephant in the room.  I had hoped Fauci, Birx, Redfield, or Walensky would step up and discuss this. So far I have only seen Cory Booker even mention it. 

Time for us to grow up and look honestly at the consequences of our actions and address _root_ causes of illness, instead of our putting-out-the-fires-we-just-set approach. It will require some adjustments in how we live but will be far more effective."

As for the sillinesses about Big Pharma and weapons research, among other things we’re signatories to seveal treaties on that. I’m sure some will sneer, but they’ve been observed pretty well for decades. Though I wouldn’t be surprised much to find out that some vicious little clown somehow accidentally died in a mysterious lab fire, and good for whoever arranged it. 

The thing to realize is that the cat’s out of the barn and sailed far, far away on that one. It’s not just that the tech’s out there already, much as it is with computers: a lot of what’s held the bad guys back is probably expertise, not knowledge, which is why it’s likely a poor idea to share mRNA tech with everybody.

It’s that as we were warned years ago, those wet markets in Asia, and some of our ag practices (no, not genenengineering corn), the ways we throw antibiotics and supplements around amount to big, extensive, haphazard, random open-air bio experiments. 

So I figure the choice is between preparation and a real disaster. Because read up on some of the viruses mentioned in this excellent article: we dodged a couple major bullets BEFORE covid-19 showed up.

If this is true, it's not some crazy, lucky coincidence that scientists were studying these viruses when one broke out. The former may have caused the latter. This matters. I'm not surprised that Fauci wants more funding for the virus research of his friends. This man uses his expertise and public trust to twist definitions and mislead us about the work we're supporting, and its attendant risks. I don't know whether this research is advisable or inadvisable. I'm not a scientist. But I'm a critical reader and critical thinker who's been around the block before.

The best ideas related to handling pandemics in this country  come from Democrats. Obama created a Pandemic taskforce (dismantled by he-who-won't-be named) and now this, which will for sure find obstructionism in the GOP. (if the vaccines were to prevent taxes, the GOP would be all over this, as this is the only thing they know).

The second thing is: where is the UN, the EU? Even China? Why not share the financial burden? Everyone could benefit from this and IF the USA gets to develop such vaccines, the whole world will start whining and crying about 1st world entitlement, demanding we send the vaccines we payed for with our tax dollars.

 If everyone benefits, everyone should contribute. It also liberates the patent issue so that labs do not have an immoral grip on life-saving medication."

A brave man who appears unafraid of irresponsible critics (I'm thinking of the political opportunists who twist facts or create outright ""untruths"" = lies); he has been among the leaders to advocate sensible behaviors to avoid Covid. Wash hands, wear a mask, maintain 6' of distance between people.  He hasn't turned mask wearing into some political statement. He wants us to wear a mask to reduce the likelihood of acquiring deadly viruses.  That behaivor isn't political, it is sensible public health and reduces the likelihood of spreading airborne diseases.
Thank you for your work, Dr. Fauci and I hope you, your family, and colleagues are safe and healthy. Keep up your good work."

What makes it worse is the double speak of cover ups from those who claim to follow the scientific method, loudly proclaiming a natural origin - before any investigation has been carried out. In fact, after well over a year of searching, only evidence to the contrary exists. How did a virus with a propensity for human ACE2 receptors manage to incorporate an extra sequence that significantly helps cleave between the S1 and S2 receptor binding domain to make it more effective at binding and entering the cell. Could it be that GoF research led by Peter Daszak, under the auspices of the Eccohealth Alliance, had a major part to play? The real cover up is when a supposedly independent investigation by the WHO happens to be led by the same man who may be behind the GoF research that caused this in the first place.

It is almost impossible to fight back against this kind of mentality and it’s going to get a lot more people killed and ruin even more peoples’ lives in the long term.  This pandemic is never going to end because of the quite frankly evil decisions made by those who spread this misinformation far and wide.

Now I’m just angry at whatever movements or political leanings have caused this perfect storm to occur.

And now it's their turn to learn for themselves, the hard way.  
I cannot feel sympathy for anyone who feels wearing a mask for the health consideration of themselves and others is an infringement on their rights.  These are people who live alone, but only in their heads.  Their self-concern outweighs the legitimate needs of everyone else.  These are, quite often the very same people who feel kids should have to endure numerous school lock downs and mass shootings, just because they want to irresponsibly own guns, and tote them around everywhere they go.  
We should have instituted a national vaccine passport verification system that we can all use to know we are safe from our narcissist neighbors.  If airlines can demand masks, and schools can demand numerous vaccines, our government can demand we all get vaccines."

Everyone’s in the public health business now, mommy bloggers and freedom fighters and quacks selling vitamin D or ivermectin. They don’t need all that visibility in our media.

If experience in high-uptake nations such as Uruguay, Britain or Mongolia is any guide, I wouldn’t start crowing about red and blue states just yet.

But we are now in the time of COVID, where the scientifically illiterate (or groups that are anti-science) can spread deadly virus and potentially breed new virus variants that could evaded our vaccines. 

Just like going over the speed limit is dangerous not just for you but for other people, being unvaccinated leaves you vulnerable to infection, more likely to give the virus time to mutate and more likely to spread the virus to other people. It’s deadly. It’s deadly for everyone.

I don’t believe my feelings are unique. The comments here confirm my state of mind. Unfortunately all of us are frustrated by our powerlessness. We don’t seem to have what it takes to convince others to change their ways. We flail around looking for reasons, excuses, and solutions to this problem. And just like the other tragedies that a minority of our nation’s people refuse to acknowledge, accept and combat (e.g., climate change and gun deaths) we remain frustrated and paralyzed by ineffective government responses and the ignorance surrounding us. Something has to change. But it won’t. We now live in a dysfunctional nation where tools previously thought of as potential changers for the better (e.g., the internet) have been weaponized by evil, greedy and ignorant forces. It’s quite a situation. Powerless to change such conditions, many of us put our popcorn in the microwave and take a first row seat to witness Darwin’s survival of the fittest firsthand."

The Times needs to offer this article free to every newspaper, news outlet, grocery store checkout lane- hand it out on street corners. I’m really not sure the unvaccinated get the fact that they are running their own experiment- and as has been said, are factories for new, perhaps more dangerous, variants.

And last week’s Stock Market concerns over vaccination rates, a one day response already in the rear view mirror, might be a wake up call to conservative leaders (who magically have started to change their tune)- what will happen to businesses with the next variant? And how long will the big, bad, federal government be able to come to the rescue??

But because mainstream started picking winners and losers…constantly bashing Trump…they lost their credibility. Trust me, there was plenty to bash, but to constantly act like another arm of the Dem party leaves half the population mistrustful of the information. Think about it…we wouldn’t even have a Fox news if mainstream had acted without bias. Anyone see Pres Biden on the CNN town hall last week? I have yet to see his mental capacity challenged by CNN. Had Trump had that performance it wd have been front page news. Come on, Hunter Biden? A nonstory?? We all know it but because we readers like trashing the other side, we don’t call it out.

Meanwhile, the FDA just approved a new Alzheimers drug whose profile is so dangerous that the Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic won't prescribe it. Maybe instead of approving a controversial drug like that simply because it's the only new pharmaceutical prospect in a decade, the agency could have a new fulltime FDA chief who'd expedite review of Covid vaccine data with an eye towards granting full approval.

However, there are some that dress it up but they are just scared. They are scared because it is new and because of the astra zeneca blood clot risks. I personally know someone who got a blood clot to lung and stomach and will be in hospital for some considerable time.

She just couldn't take it anymore. Covid patients overtaking her ward. Too many patients to care for. Nursing shortage. Longer hours, Patients dying in her care at rates she's never experienced before Covid. 

Low vaccination rates in places like Shreveport are stressing the healthcare system and skilled nurses, therapists and doctors are leaving the field. Retiring early. Moving to lower risk positions away from patient contact.

The management of the pandemic must come from the federal government who is responsible for coordinating the national response. The GOP, and its unenlightened constituency, seem to believe that is OK to question the science and the public health strategy to address the pandemic in an aggressive and coordinated manner. Instead we have an uncoordinated and mixed response from GOP lead states that is putting the response to the pandemic at risk and placing Americans at risk for death or serious sequelae from COVID infection. The federal government must have more authority to coordinate the response to these types of national emergencies. The courts should support this need and stop trying to play doctor and scientist.

2021-07-26 13:42:24,"Public health officials are going to have to get strategic. Concentrate first on those who are hesitant about the vaccine for rational reasons. For example, the historical mistreatment of Black people by medical researchers is not a conspiracy theory; it was quite real, but those who worry about this might be persuaded that history is not repeating itself now. Those who wish for more long-term data before taking the vaccine might be convinced that the data are sufficient now with a reasoned argument. Both groups might concede to wear a mask until such time as they are ready to take the vaccine. Remind them that such a step is harmless and reversible; ask them to do it while they think about taking the vaccine, and then step back.

Focus on those who are rational but wrong, protect those who cannot take the vaccine, and let the nihilists weed themselves out. You will not change the mind of a Trumpite. Don’t waste time trying. For many of them it will be a self-correcting problem."

That's been gone for a long time, probably since about the start of the Common Core implementation.  So is this the fault of Common Core?  No, but when the focus of our educational system is on passing a test, and that test doesn't include critical thinking (analyzing literary themes is not the same as being able to think critically about real-life issues), then there's a problem.

Louisiana's not the only state where people have been convinced to act against their own self-interests.  By couching many issues in inflammatory rhetoric designed to cause fear (vaccination, universal health care, higher minimum wage) there seems to be a definite segment of the population interested in sowing division.

2021-07-26 13:57:07,"Here in Up-State NY we have a lot of deer and a lot of roads.  When I was young fifty years ago, it was common to see a lot of dead deer on the road sides, victims of collisions with automobiles.  More recently the number of deer traffic victims has declined (strictly personal observation, anecdotal evidence). 

Lately I've noticed that many deer stop and look around before crossing.  I've assumed that those who are more cautious survive and procreate, producing generations of survivors, who are continuing the evolution of  traffic related survival behaviors.

Prejudice against vaccines demonstrates a lack of awareness, and, like the deer crossing the road, unaware of the danger, some of those who refuse vaccination will suffer dire consequences.   As public awareness of the danger increases, the logic of vaccination will become more apparent and more people will avail themselves of vaccine protection.

People often resist being told what to do, but as the contagion gets worse, common sense will begin to prevail.  Many will suffer, and some will die in the slow process of intuitive education.  Progress will be measured in years, not in months or days."

After all, right now, premiums for all of us who have health insurance are certainly going to rise to cover the costs of Covid patients who now don't have health insurance, or already get insurance via the welfare system.

It's getting clearer and clearer. While ""social media"" is a cancer for which no treatment has been found yet, those old media are crucial in keeping ""resistance"" embers glowing.

Seemingly sane individuals playing their ""marked cards"" of ""breakthroughs,"" non-FDA approval, nasty reactions, government-intent-on-killing-people, etc. appear on national networks (Sinclair comes to mind) and local outlets. Even England escaped that insanity!

It is not just the obvious health issues presented. When America’s enemies and adversaries look to find ways to destabilize and subvert our democracy they jump all over the division and discord currently going on, their nefarious tasks have been made so much easier. Our government agencies must continue to push for people getting the vaccine. It is a battle to do this, but some of those who refuse may change their minds. Unfortunately, it seems the real way in which most of these minds are changed is when these people see a family member or friend get the virus and then such person pleads for their family and friends to get the vaccine immediately. This is a horrible situation our country is in, that a group of individuals and organizations can push lies and false narratives and it has a devastating effect on America.

There are millions of us who are once again retreating from full involvement in the economy for fear of spreading Delta, even if we personally are vaccinated.  Even if vaccinated, one can get sick from Delta, and one can possibly transmit Delta to an unvaccinated individual who could die.  The responsible portion of the US population that is vaccinated does not want to kill the ignorant fools who are still unvaccinated, even if they are ignorant. Plus my wife was so sick from Pfizer #2 that she worries that she’ll get similarly sick from Delta.  

So once again, no dining out for us, no malls, no parties, no shopping, no nothing other than the grocery/pharmacy. We suspect the business community would realize they also need to do more to help."

The numbers are the worst they have been since January, when the vaccine was still not widely available.

One in five of all COVID cases in the U.S. occurred In Florida — for the second week in a row. Hospitals are filling up again, even exceeding their pandemic high in Jacksonville and Daytona Beach. 

Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths are skyrocketing.

Great job, DeSantis"
2021-07-26 15:36:40,"Since people had the opportunity to get vaccinated, I don't think that they should be treated in the hospitals and burden us with the cost of their care. 

Trump declared that he loved the poorly educated and we have a half of a nation that is showing just how much they didn't benefit from their education. 

The real issue: almost half the country was happy with liar and seditionist Trump. His promotion of baseless conspiracy theories is like fighting for an underdog or spreading hot gossip; it's much more interesting than the reality of getting a vaccine, which he DID get."

It's a sad commentary that so many people are swayed by misinformation. 

The vaccine development was the result of Operation Warp Speed - a Trump administration initiative. And President Biden has done well making the vaccine available. 

This isn't a conspiracy. It isn't political. It has nothing to do with government overstretch or medical experiments done 80 years ago."
2021-07-26 15:52:41,"It is amazing that mankind started forming groups or societies 5 to 6 thousand years ago and to think that this is the best our civilization has achieved. As much as I admire the dedication of these public health care professionals I would not blame any of them from walking away. I am 72, fully vaccinated and keep wearing my mask out in public so long as we have such a large population of unvaccinated people who are the breeding ground for new variants that we as yet will experience. Mother Nature has always been about survival of the fittest which by definition includes mental awareness, intelligence nd critical thinking. Perhaps she is just thinning out the herd and we need to let things run their course."

If it's good enough for then why not you?"
2021-07-26 15:33:46,"""Candy Peavy, a resident, warned that the Biden administration would send people door to door to “document unvaccinated Americans” --  a false, widespread conspiracy theory. Not only that, Ms. Peavy told the hundreds in attendance, the vaccine was an “experimental gene therapy” that had killed thousands in the United States.""

How does Ms. Peavy know all this? Does she attend meetings at the White House and is privy to their plans? Is she a chemist or molecular biologist that has analyzed the vaccine and found that is ""experimental gene therapy""?

I imagine that she heard a hatemonger on Hate Radio's propaganda format, designed to rouse the rabble. And such does indeed work, always has, probably always will.

We're in a war of words, a clash of ideas, mainly for control and maintenance of our society, its ways and laws. The battle, I doubt, will ever be fully won by one side of the other, just like most of these situations, so finally the two sides part company, as did the Christian Church into Protestant and Roman Catholic, which then divided into Eastern Orthodox and countless Protestant sects. (When does a cult become a religion? The same as when a hill becomes a mountain, i.e., when it becomes big enough. Size matters; quality doesn't.)

Plato thought education was society's panacea. And, yes, it probably is, however, you can lead a horse to water, but not make it drink. We are drowning in our self-imposed ignorance.

There is an old saying, ""you can't help a dog if he wants to lie on the ground"". Unfortunately, we are going to have to let those people write their own epitaphs and prepare for more variants as a result of the unvaccinated..."

As Dr. Fauci has said we have the tools to stop this pandemic, but people believe conservative politicians and talk show hosts over someone who has spent a lifetime in the study of infectious diseases. The results are a large segment of our population is unwilling to look at facts, unwilling to accept reality, and unwilling to think critically."
2021-07-26 15:57:44,"I haven't noticed much discussion about why it is so difficult to convince those who haven't vaccinated to get vaccinated.

I think a bit part of it is how the human brain learns.  When we learn we make two kinds of connections.  One type is to prior learning.  The second type are new physical connections between neurons in our brains.

Except for early in life (around 18 months), learning doesn't involve disconnecting neurons.  Just connections.  

So, when we learn something that is wrong, that learning stays with us either until we die or we suffer some sort of brain damage.  We can make new connections about the correct information but the incorrect information still has connections.  

This is one reason that misinformation is so dangerous.  If initially believed to be true, it ""sticks"" and remains ""forever."""

Restricted access for the anti vaccinated.Mandatory vaccination for anyone employed including all civil servants and private sector workers .

The republican agenda is for the vaccination effort to fail causing more chaos ,civil unrest and economic disaster.They will blame the current administration and eventually further consolidate their hegemony over America.

They have no regard for the misery and havoc they create.

 That threat is misinformation used  by those who would employ the fear of experts, science and government for political and personal gain. 
Knowing the truth about the power of effective and safe vaccines to stop the Covid pandemic, they instead broadcast the lies designed to weaken social cohesion and persuade the vulnerable that public health measures and the vaccine are a greater threat to their personal freedom than the virus is to their health. The identity of those conspirators is no mystery.
Map the counties and states where vaccination rates are lowest and compliance with CDC guidelines are  not practiced and one finds that the virus now is mostly out of control in states controlled by Republican politicians. 
The greatest surges of the Delta variant are in states that Trump won in the 2020 election.Until Mr. Trump and his party publicly advise their followers to get vaccinated, the ability of others to persuade the unvaccinated to protect themselves is likely to fail. In Louisiana if only Trump and respected local Republican Party leaders would publicly support mass vaccination  this resurgent epidemic in Red States could be contained."

The Republican Party, which follows a fascist philosophy in all but name, continues to follow a strategy of fostering chaos , then gaining full control. That’s their objective, and it’s been their objective for decades. What’s sadly amazing is that they’re in the minority, but they espouse a message based on emotions , not on reason and logic. In the short run, emotion always wins. The problem is that in the short run , they may wreck our Nation, and the rest of us won’t be able to put it back together.

States and local governments have tried to incentivize their residents to get the vaccine by running lotteries and offering other rewards. It hasn’t worked. 

How about denying medical treatment to those who refuse for no good reason to get available vaccine and later become infected/sick? If people don’t care enough for themselves and others to get vaccinated, why should scarce and expensive medical resources be used to bring them back to health when they contract the virus because they have refused vaccination. Innocent lives saved through changed behavior are likely to exceed, many times over, the lives of those who just won’t do the right thing. Maybe that will make a difference. Nothing else seems to. 

It is true that many ailments resulting from reckless personal behavior are nevertheless treated medically, e.g., smokers are treated for lung cancer and drug/alcohol abusers are treated for their addictions. But generally, that risky behavior doesn’t have the same potential to endanger other innocent members of the public as does the selfish and senseless refusal by many to get vaccinated. This is different."

And if that isn't insane enough, there is also public intimidation going on.  In some neighborhoods it's apparent that people are afraid to get vaccinated dues to threats, implied or real, from local, rabid anti-vaxers.  That's criminal behavior.  If it's not illegal, it should be.

And the intimidation is not just from neighbors and ""friends"".  It can also be from spouses and ""partners"".  I have personal knowledge of one couple where the wife believes the social media lies but the husband is a scientist.  He has wants to be vaccinated but she threatens him with instant divorce if he gets vaccinated.  Oh, and they have children too young to be vaccinated who are therefore vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their mother's insanity.  I am quite sure the gender roles in such insanity are often/usually reversed too, and not just with threats of divorce.

The preceding suggests one thing to me.  That the medical community should do outreach saying that you can remain anonymous if you get vaccinated.  Medical information is already private, but an effort should be made to make sure the unvaccinated people WILL know that they can get their vaccines AND remain anonymous to protect them from spouses, partners, neighbors, friends, co-workers or any other anti-vaxxer cretins."

This would exacerbate the climate chaos and extreme weather patterns already being experienced and in all likelihood lead to the extinction of all vertebrate animals on the planet. This abrupt change in climate compares to that experienced during the Permian extinction when 96% of life on Earth perished. In short, we have much bigger fish to fry - much more than pimples on an elephant's back.

Moreover, we should not lose sight of the looming energy and resource crisis that is bound to take hold in the next decade. Once the fossil fuels and other critical minerals are depleted there is no way for society to feed its huge energy appetite - economic and social collapse are imminent just as forecasted in 1972 by 27 researchers at MIT in their best selling book - 30 million copies - Limits to Growth. 

Hence if the Arctic melt and Blue Ocen Event does not cause our collapse; then Mother Nature has a backstop of depleting all our critical energy and mineral resources in the not too distant future. One might say - Mother Nature Bats Last.

In summary, it's time to stop fretting about relatively little pimples and to take a perspective of the whole elephant for what it is and says - we have MUCH BIGGER fish to fry..."

2. The refuseniks should go to the back of the line for hospital and ICU beds, behind those with other medical needs.

3. Private companies and public venues should deny access to the refuseniks. Your choice. Your responsibility and consequences.

But for any state serious about solving this as best they can locally, proof of vaccination for indoor leisure and entertainment in public venues should be required.

Remember back to September and October, 2020 - Kamala, Biden, Cuomo, virtually all prominent Democrats said they would not trust a vaccine developed under Trump. They essentially said that the FDA could be swayed to approve an unsafe vaccine for political purposes. Prior to this, most people trusted the FDA. Now, the situation is reversed, but many remember that these prominent Democrats, now in charge, admitted that the FDA and its approval process was political. Had they trusted the ""Trump vaccine"" in 2020 and said, back then, that vaccines are not political, their arguments today would carry much more weight."

(1) Vaccine mandates are needed — for federal transportation, the military, colleges and universities, hospitals, etc.

(2) Employers and insurers should also require vaccination for all those who work with others indoors, or at least masking and frequent self-paid COVID tests for the unvaccinated.

(3) FDA/CDC need to move quickly on full authorization and on emergency use authorization for those under 12.

We don’t try to convince people to get vaccinated against other highly contagious diseases, like measles, chickenpox, or polio. We require vaccinations to get an education or join the military, etc. same approach is needed for COVID."

He is fully vaccinated now. Just last week, he thinks he picked up Covid yet again. Mild symptoms. 

I asked him how many of his co-workers were vaccinated, and he informed me that very few are. This is ridiculous. It is high time to mandate vaccines in the workplace. He will resume mask wearing in the office, since his unvaccinated colleagues generally don't wear them. Joe Biden, this is a federal workplace- are you paying attention?"
2021-07-25 18:08:39,"I've been vaccinated, but the current vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission making all the vaccinated potential hosts for the infection even if their symptoms turn out to be mild.  The only way to prevent spread is mask-wearing and another lockdown among the entire general population but this would remove a major incentive to get vaccinated in the first place.

This has become an endemic disease and vaccinations will never eliminate it because of its rate of mutation.  As we are finding out, vaccinations grow weaker over time and time is running out."
2021-07-25 18:09:20,"America’s long lasting struggle with anti-intellectualism once again is to blame here and it’s only getting worse. Many average Americans resent the bookworm egghead types who are imploring them to get vaccinated. I think a lot of this can be blamed on academic tracking which became commonplace after WW2. The gifted kids were separated out from everyone else supposedly for their benefit, leaving everyone else in ‘regular’ classes, and then kids who were progressing more slowly were put into their own classes. From that point on the resentment builds— the gifted kids go on to good colleges and get the best jobs, what does everyone else get? So when Dr. Fauci and his accomplished cohorts tell people to get vaccinated, people want to do the opposite. Then you have Ted Cruz types, who firmly belong to the nerd group, but they try to appear less so to appeal to the broader group and end up doing even more harm. All this is to say that there are deep-seated reasons why Americans won’t do the wisest things in their own self-interest, and much of it comes down to who is telling them to do what."

Yes, a Vaccination Passport would have been unpopular and would have taken time to implement, but it should have been done.

That we haven't is a testimony to the cynical political calculations Republicans use to assess their chances in the next election, their only concern.  600,00 dead fits comfortably into those numbers, they're fine with that and perhaps a couple hundred thousand more to demonstrate their complete commitment to irresponsible personal freedom.  The backbone of the modern Republican Party, personal freedom with absolutely no responsibility for anyone else .  The freedom to casually kill others to protect your lethal ignorance."

The federal government could offer, say,  $300 for the first jab and $400 for the second. Yes, this would be unfair to those responsible enough to take the vaccines voluntarily, but it's realistically the only way to motivate millions of unvaccinated people. The program would bring in the lazy and the ""too busy to get the shots"" segment of the population, and there are untold millions in this category. Yes, the die-hard Trumpies and anti-vaxers will still refuse, but their ranks will be culled by Delta anyway."

There would obviously need to be carve-outs for minors and individuals with underlying health conditions (e.g., autoimmune disorders) but it could be very effective.

Only recently, have Republican officials realized that they are harming their own voters and have engaged in a deadly form of voter suppression of their own base. It's time for the Biden administration to act and to issue mandatory vaccinations for all federal employees and the military; to require proof of vaccination for all interstate travel by air, bus, or rail; to issue vaccine passports to those who want them; and to urge all businesses, colleges and universities, and health care institutions to mandate vaccinations for all employees which the courts have upheld.

2021-07-25 18:28:58,"Here is what I understand this article ( and other serious sources) to say:

-  87% of new cases in America  originate from the Delta variant;
- Delta is a ""breakthrough"" variant, meaning that it infects even vaccinated persons in substantial numbers;
- Delta is more easily transmitted than earlier variants, though among vaccinated persons (and possibly unvaccinated persons) it is less likely to lead to death or serious illness;
- some consequences of the Delta variant may persist longer than we expect from a virus;
- ""early evidence"" suggests that Delta infections produce substantially more of the virus in infected blood than earlier variants.

I have read through this article twice, but I think it does not say what percentage of new infections ( Delta or otherwise) are among vaccinated persons.

And it does not seem to say whether vaccinated persons, who have become infected with the Delta variant, are as likely to spread the virus to others, as are unvaccinated persons.

It seems to me these questions are important.  Have I missed something?"

But last week I got a cold. Everyone in my family fought theirs off—but it nearly sidelined me. I had a cut on my leg recently and it turned into a wound. My immense system has forgotten how to fight back.

Friends and family members understand, at a gut level, the degree of jeopardy I am in but they, too, have fatigue.

Some of the reasons I have heard are: they know someone who got Guillain Barre from the swine flu vaccine, they are young and have already had Covid, they are nursing an infant, it is still only approved thru Emergency Use Authorization, etc.  They have legitimate concerns despite the risk they are willing to accept by avoiding the vaccine.   There is some dark humor in the statements I hear such as ""Darwin was right,"" ""the best way to reduce your carbon footprint is to not get the vaccine,"" or ""the GOP is inadvertently counteracting their voter suppression efforts by killing off their base.""

I so wish the government will acknowledge the inadequacy of the J&J vaccine, and allow people like me to get one of the vaccines that confers higher efficacy. Recent studies show that the J&J vaccine's efficacy has decreased from the high 60% to the high 30%, since the variants arrived here.

Those opposed to vaccination for libertarian, pseudoscience, or spurious reasons based on misinformation do not seem to appreciate that their actions are potentially endangering others, as well as themselves, by giving the virus endless opportunities to mutate.  This is unnecessarily prolonging our collective suffering as a society.  After months of debate, the university where I teach has decided against a vaccine mandate, while also requiring a return to full F2F instruction.  Infection rates in our county are now at the same levels as early July 2020, but the campus will be relying on an honor system for thousands of returning college students from all over the world, as well as faculty and staff, to wear a mask if they are not vaccinated.  Since there is no way to know whether a given unmasked student  or colleague is vaccinated or not, and since I do not wish to risk a breakthrough infection and possible long-haul COVID syndrome, I will have no choice but to wear a double or N95 mask while lecturing and interacting with students and colleagues, and maintain awkward social distancing protocols at meetings and seminars. For those of us working in front-line professions in large communities, there can be no ""return to normal"" until herd immunity is reached."
2021-07-25 18:47:47,"Rs will use any issue to divide us, no matter the consequences. The unvaccinated need to be publicly shunned, excluded from social events and schools. They will eventually relent. Mandates just set their minds more strongly against complying, like willful children."
2021-07-25 18:48:02,"""The number of infections has ticked up — slowly at first, then swiftly — to 51,000 cases per day, on average, more than four times the rate a month ago.""

A positive Covid test is considered a case but that raw number doesn't tell us how many of these people get seriously sick, how many wind up in the hospital and how many of those die.  Without these details, the number of cases is meaningless."
2021-07-25 18:50:46,"The longer these people refuse to be vaccinated, the more chance of them fostering a mutant virus that is immune to the current vaccines. Then they will possibly cause hundreds of thousands more deaths in this Country and we will have to deal with the chaos that ensues. Unvaccinated people are a serious threat to us all and need to be dealt with accordingly."
2021-07-25 18:51:21,"If you look at a national map of vaccination rates, it’s shockingly similar to our last electoral college map.  That tells you everything you need to know about the partisan rejection of rationality and science.  As a health care provider it’s disheartening, demoralizing and infuriating.  But how do you use reason and evidence to reach a demographic that fundamentally rejects those tools as legitimate?  Even getting critically ill isn’t enough to persuade some people.  It’s hard to be hopeful in the face of such persistent, pernicious ignorance."
2021-07-25 18:52:49,"I am finding that I have a lot of anger toward people that can get vaccinated and are just choosing not to do so.  They are choosing to believe TikTok videos, facebook memes, and Instagram posts over experts at institutions like Mayo Clinic, Fred Hutch, and Harvard.  They are choosing to believe fringe MDs and ODs that have slithered into the profiteering depths of snake oil salesmen over trusted public health departments and epidemiologists that have dedicated their lives to keeping our communities safe.  Their choices are selfish, ignorant, and deadly.  I am especially angry at politicians that are pandering to these ignorant and selfish choices.  The blood of every COVID death is on their hands."
2021-07-25 18:53:37,"Stop using the term “Vaccine Hesitancy”. It allows the refusal to have the appearance of rationality. It is no such thing. Refusing the vaccine is the result of refusing to accept the word of the CDC, the entire medical community ( with the exception of a few grifters), refusing the word of researchers, scientists, academics, medical publications, you name it, while accepting the word of a pathological liar and unknown strangers on the internet. 

This is not hesitancy, it’s some form of misguided politics driven by hatred and racism. 

Let us stop coddling these fools that are holding up and holding back an entire nation."
2021-07-25 18:53:56,"Today's Republican Party has devolved into a doomsday cult. A suicide pact.

2021-07-25 18:54:03,"At the start of the pandemic, we were all in the same boat with no choice but to wear masks and stay apart.  Now, we have scientifically proven vaccines that would make the pandemic a historical memory if everyone who could be vaccinated did so.  Those who spread misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines are responsible for the delay in eradication of the virus and for the grave consequences that will continue to befall all of us.  It's a simple ask and it is largely free-get vaccinated.  Do it for your own well-being, for your fellow humans and for our collective future."
2021-07-25 18:54:54,"Those who remain unvaccinated by choice (e.g.  no medical contraindication) are responsible for causing illness, long-term disability and death for some. When people die, the actions of the unvaccinated are tantamount to manslaughter. The only difference between them and others whose actions cause death is that in the case of the virus it is not possible to draw a straight line from a non-vaccinated individual to the death of a specific person. The inability to draw such a line allows the unvaccinated to get off the hook, not just criminally, but more importantly, morally. It is also what allows them to sleep well at night."

No use of gyms.
No attending theaters or other public venues.
No admittance to federal, state, or local government buildings.
No travel by any form of public transportation.

I am tired of my freedom being restricted by people who refuse to get vaccinated and then expect to enjoy the freedom we vaccinated can by virtue of our having done so. It is absurd."
2021-07-25 18:57:26,"Maybe the Biden administration should set up a program in which those who are adamantly opposed to receiving a Covid-19 vaccination can designate their vaccine doses to go to someone in an African or Central American country. It would be better than having valuable doses sit in freezers until they expire. I suspect, however, that the vaccine-refusers may be dogs in mangers and would not want anyone else to receive the vaccine, either. If they were even minimally altruistic, they would demonstrate it by getting the vaccine to protect not only themselves, but also their families and communities."
2021-07-25 18:57:30,"People who refuse to be vaccinated are becoming excessively dangerous to the rest of us.  We need vaccine passports so unvaccinated adults can be kept out of public places.  Also, unvaccinated parents should not receive the new child tax credits."

No flying. No eating out. No shopping. No concerts. No church. No public transportation. No NOTHING where any of them can possibly expose anyone who HAS gotten the vaccine to the variants that are percolating among them. Yes, people have the right to refuse to be vaccinated. NO, they do NOT have the right to attempt to take advantage of those who have been vaccinated, to infringe on our freedom of movement, and to put our health and safety at risk. The time for the carrot is over! We need our government and business leaders to get out their big sticks and make it matter for those who are responsible for this public health crisis to continue (and probably spread again, thanks to developing variants among the unvaccinated)! If France and Italy can do it, WE can do it! Vaccines passports, NOW!"
2021-07-25 19:00:38,"By the end of the year, this pandemic will be over one way or the other. Everyone will have gotten the vaccine, or gotten COVID. Some unfortunate souls will have had both.

And while I know I should be better than this, I've stopped caring. I'm vaxxed. I still don't want to get COVID, and I am willing to wear a mask indoors again, but I am confident I won't be hospitalized. 

As they say, the Lord helps those who helped themselves. Understandably public health officials are desperate to reach those who refuse vaccination, but I am done.

I will save my prayers for those who can't get hospital beds when they are all taken by COVID patients, and the rare souls who got vaccinated, but still got a serious infection."

2. The virus is real and not a hoax. 
3. Taking the vaccine will only help you and those around you. 
4. This is a public health crisis that has nothing to do with politics. 

I think letting go of the first fantasy is going to be the hardest. But we all have to grow up and deal with life on life’s terms someday, don’t we? Unless endorsing the endless tantrums and delusions of a desperate former king baby/failed reality tv host is a sword you really, really want to die on, go get vaccinated. Today."

Their (at best) unenthusiastic advocacy of vaccines to their (at worst) outright hostility to them serves a higher purpose for the Grand Old Party--it increases the chance of failure--on all fronts--of the Biden administration both in the short term (looking forward to the mid-terms) and in the long term for when their messiah returns in 2024. I fear their calculations may be correct.
2021-07-25 19:04:17,"You label white refusal mostly political and Black and Hispanic refusal as due to socioeconomic factors.

Where in this mix are the people who think the vaccine will implant computer chips? The ones who think it decreases fertility? The ones afraid of side effects? The ones who don't trust standard medicine?

2021-07-25 19:05:44,"Let's put the blame where it belongs.  Republicans and right wing media, led by Trump, mocked and lied about coronavirus for a year.  They convinced their followers that they did not need to be vaccinated or that the vaccine was a government conspiracy.  What did we expect?  The current situation is the logical outcome.  

The outcry is already starting at the mere hint of a return to masks or social distancing, however limited.  Republican governors, especially those running for office, refuse to even mention mitigation measures lest they jeopardize their election chances.  It's craven, cynical and cruel."
2021-07-25 19:06:58,"Although I am vaccinated and healthy, I am back to wearing a good quality mask anytime I have to go to an indoor public place and I certainly won’t be going to the theatre or indoor dining anytime soon. The reason: everyone in my area is acting like the pandemic is over, even though the Delta variant is causing a growth in Covid cases and hospitalizations are going up. Yesterday, I was literally the only person wearing a mask in a large, crowded store. I need to protect my young grandson who cannot be vaccinated.  How sad that so many Americans either lack the critical thinking skills to make a well-informed decision on the vaccine, based on real science and not Facebook disinformation, or listen to right wing hacks who are literally content to kill people if it profits them to do so."

Too often, ""both sides"" journalism has muted the clarion call for action, the criminal encouragement of inaction and a clear understanding of the most salient facts. ""Biden's goal"" of inoculating 70% of the population is a great example. Who called it that? The press did. And who made the failure of reaching 70% a ""problem for Biden"".  It's not a game, it's not a horse race, it's not a popularity contest. It's life or death. And you can apply the exact same reasoning to ignorance over climate change. The NYT too often enables the lie by politicizing the truth. Keep up the good work, Ms. Mandavilli and maybe your colleagues will act accordingly too."

2021-07-25 19:09:15,"We are having a world war against the Covid virus.  There are eight billion potential victims.  We have a way of defeating it, the vaccines.  

In WWII, the American public was so committed to the war effort that all sacrificed everything asked of them for victory.  People even recycled bacon grease to make ammunition.  Think about that.  They saved the grease instead of throwing it out.

In today's world, this war is not being fought on a united front.  It is bifurcated into two camps.  The non-vaccinated camp often makes the claim that they don 't need it.  They don't consider that we all need it.  If they remain unvaccinated, they not only risk themselves, they risk passing it to an innocent child, who could die from the disease.

Not only that, as in war, the opposition constantly improves its capabilities.  The virus is doing exactly that by mutating and becoming more transmissible and virulent.  Delta is about 200 times more contagious than the original strain.

As mentioned in the article, new strains are emerging and the unvaccinated provide a fertile ground for that to happen.

But yet, in lieu of all that, nearly half the nation won't get the shot.  I don't need it.  I don't want it.  It don't trust it.  I'm free, I don't have to do anything I don't want to do.

And the virus is laughing at them.  

If our citizenry behaved this way During WWII, we would have lost the war.  Covid has already killed more than died during that 
conflagration.  But, it's all about me."

We started out slowly, with Tier 1A only, but those first few weeks I saw the most vulnerable, desperately grateful to get their shots. Most were elderly, remembered polio, and smallpox vaccines, and the eradication of those scourges. 
Then, when we opened up to all 18 and over, we were SWAMPED, doing 5-6K shots a day for WEEKS, and again, people so grateful we were there doing  this critical work to protect our communities. It petered out some after the first month, but surged again when Pfizer was allowed for 12 and over. I saw the same people returning with their children, asking when their younger ones could also get their jabs. 
Those waves also petered out, and our last month open slowed to dribs and drabs, and people being required by their jobs, especially health care workers, who were deeply unhappy about this workplace mandate. 
I found that anger to be insane - working closely with people, especially in health care, WHY wouldn’t you get protection, especially after so many have died?
Our vaccination centre alone did over 250K shots, and we could have done twice as many, if only people came in.

So I decided to wait. And I’ve been isolated at home, while my fully vaccinated husband does all errands. And I voted for Biden, in a blue state (not that this should matter to this discussion).

I wish everyone would get vaccinated, and it is a stone fact that many people will die who would have lived if everyone had gotten shots.

But that's not going to happen.  As a culture and as a society, the United States does not have the wherewithal to stamp this pandemic out at this time. 

Still, look at the bright side.  There will be fewer deaths than there were previously, and we are getting closer to full societal immunity.  We are much better off than we were six months ago. A year from now things will be better still.

Those who are in anger or despair about other people not getting vaccinated perhaps do not appreciate the deep and abiding sub-rationality of many of their fellow humans. Spending a couple days with a doctor seeing regular folks in the clinic would be educational.

Also, many of you seem to not to live in the USA.  Either that or else your schooling was deficient because you seem to  have no idea of the protections that exist in our society from being forced to do much of anything.

By refusing to go along with the rest of the nation,  getting the vaccine, something no one ever refuses if it is to prevent mumps, polio or small pox, these millions of people, led on by what they fear are threats against their politics, may create such severe problems that they will be the first group of people whose illness will be seen as  brought on by themselves, and there may be little or no rush or  desire to take great care of them. , in treating the ""victims"". Of course many will be the kids and older folks who would not have gotten sick except that the vicious partisans of stupid politics convinced them that they were-like superman-invulnerable and that nothing would penetrate their armored hides. 
If this is how some are perceived-they may end up, 
ironically-as the last to be treated.
Tired and stressed doctors , nurses and hospital workers may unconsciously take out their resentments against people whose own misbehavior has brought them this problem.
  This seems, as far as I know, to be the first mass spread disease in US history  which a large part of the nation refuses to even believe in. It reminds me of how badly AIDS patients were treated in Africa-much as the bearers of bad tidings.






This may encourage many to falsify their vaccination-it may encourage others to get the real one. It is strange and new for the US."
2021-07-25 19:33:25,"Sadly, Michael Osterholm’s projections of as many as 800,000 American deaths by the end of this pandemic may have been optimistic.  A couple of days ago NPR reported on a new set of projections from a group working with the CDC; in the worst case scenario, October 2021 would look like the worst days of last winter in terms of cases and deaths, the vast majority amongst unvaccinated individuals.  Covid-scoffers and anti-vaxxers who will be the victims in this continuing epidemic seem to be sold on the idea that their defiance of masking and vaccination is the “smart” thing to do.  Where are those ideas coming from?"
2021-07-25 19:34:06,"The is another article that says the Delta mutation in Indonesia is causing an alarming number of deaths in children, half of them under five. That’s coming here eventually, mark my words. I wonder if losing a child will change any minds among the staunch anti vaxxers? Probably not."
2021-07-25 19:35:20,"While there is a very small percentage of people who shouldn't get vaccinated due to medical conditions, there is no valid reason for anyone else not to.  Your personal freedom, your religious objections, and all other freedoms not to get vaccinated end at your nose - the minute you exhale and spread disease.  If you don't want to participate in this society, fine.  Lock yourself away.  Quit your job, don't go to stores or restaurants or bars or any public places.  It's your right. But please stay out of public - including, but especially, polling places."
2021-07-25 19:36:22,"When I watch a lot of evening newscasts and read news magazines about the coronavirus, the delta threat and how it impacts the lives of not only Americans, but also Californians, misinformation could become a weak spot to social media. Misinformation is meant to be mostly misleading, somewhat deceptive because it makes a promotion of conspiracy theory to many anti-vaccinated people. Misinformation can be unprotected under the First Amendment, I think."
2021-07-25 19:37:46,"I can understand the hesitancy, given the convoluted  message from government leaders, the CDC, the FDA and just about every other hand in managing the fight against the virus, including but not limited to health vs economy, health vs perceived freedom. ect.

Sometimes it takes a good kick in the backside to set the story straight, and that is exactly what is happening now as the virus' comeback has proven.

Hesitancy or not, the vaccine is all we have got. Logic would dictate it is better to err on the side of what seems to be effective than to err on the side of what is now proven ineffective way forward."
2021-07-25 19:37:51,"This is interesting: the republican's beliefs and policies, the politicizing of wearing masks and the don't trust government (except the republicans, of course) attitude toward science and health programs, etc. - all of these actions are contributing in a big way to the survival of the fittest.  It is understood that some persons cannot use vaccines because of bad reactions.  But vaccines are doing in the majority of the population what they were invented for: to promote survival.  So I find it very weird that the religious right and the RNC are actually promoting and making a very big contribution to EVOLUTION.  Stupidity does not promote survival."
2021-07-25 19:41:39,"This is again the push/pull of the old vs the new politics.  In the old way of thinking, the republicans, seeing that their messaging is literally killing their own constituency with uncanny precision, would obviously walk it back and take their political lumps for all the ridiculous stuff they said earlier - if not for humanitarian reasons then at least for electoral viability.  But the new party does not walk anything back.  They do not apologize.  They are sure that just makes them look weak.  So the initial, knee-jerk reaction was quickly overwhelmed by the new Trumper leaders.  Hannity walked his pro-vaccine comments back in just one day.  Sarah Sanders said that if we just heaped praise on Trump for telling scientists to do what they were doing anyway, maybe he would help us save American lives by telling his followers the truth.  Imagine that.  Abused wives take note: maybe daddy will stop beating you if you tell him how great he is.
The result is a new kind of dog whistle.  They want their voters to get vaccinated, but they don't want to say it out loud.  Watching these contortions, is it any wonder that the public is starting to lose their optimism?"
2021-07-25 19:41:56,"The people who are getting misinformation and refuse to get vaccinated are hurting us all. I have had too many debates where I hear, “ I’d rather take my chances with the virus, too many people have died from the vaccine, it’s experimental “ and on and on. I gently try to make my point, but until we have more vaccine mandates we will not get out of this mess."
2021-07-25 19:43:21,"The people who refuse vaccinations don't care about how they can spread it to vaccinated people in closed in spaces. They even question the effectiveness of vaccines when this happens. (see other comments below) You don't get a flu shot and then go hang out with people with the flu thinking oh, I won't get it. People who refuse at this point are just being crazy. COVID-19 would be over if it were not for them. We are back to wearing masks indoors too. Ugh all preventable just like the current deaths."
2021-07-25 19:45:32,"I'm so disgusted by all these selfish people, I can hardly see straight. My dad fought on the front line in Vietnam. He's a disabled veteran who now has Alzheimers and desperately needs to be placed in a VA nursing home. 

But guess what? Because of covid, the homes have been limiting admissions. They finally started welcoming new patients a few months ago, but now with Delta, it looks like they will be limiting once again. And the waiting list my dad is on will grow even longer. 

So thanks a lot to the willfully unvaccinated. My dad sacrificed greatly for your ""freedoms,"" which you are now abusing to his detriment."
2021-07-25 19:45:33,"The oral pill by Vaxart is the solution to this pandemic. They have demonstrated in clinical trials that it provides immunity most likely for years, has much higher T-cell counts than Moderna and Pfizer, and is cross-reactive to variants. There's a reason it's called the Holy Grail. It's shelf-stable, so Amazon drones can deliver to rural parts of the world. Just entering Phase 2 in Columbia. P3 will be in Latin American and India. The goal is to apply for a EUA next spring. Sean Tucker (Founder) has been working on oral vaccines for almost two decades, and he is way ahead in the game. Vaxart has also never failed a clinical trial on any product in their pipeline. They have the science and it works. I've been researching this company for a year - their pill is a disruptor to Big Pharma and a total game-changer."
2021-07-25 19:45:39,Yet another example of the hypocrisy coming from some on the right (No fauci ouchie).  They have such strenuous objections to getting a vaccine because they don't want the government to tell them to do anything that has to do with their physical bodies.  And yet they have no hesitation in telling women what to do about a pregnancy.

She is sick as a dog and we are hoping the vaccine will help to prevent anything more serious. Her doctor says this is not uncommon, as least in his practice.

My daughter had to cancel her plans to enjoy a Beach vacation with us and is quarantined at home. The friend? He's asymptomatic and back at work. As a bartender.

We are both shocked and hoping for the best. Mask up, folks. Get vaccinated. This is serious stuff."
2021-07-25 19:50:57,"I have been vaccinated, did not find it in any way a stressful or traumatic experience.  I don't understand people's hesitancy, but I can't help seeing how it has become yet another media intensified left/right political controversy.  Shaming, leftist urgings of the need for government compulsion, etc., are not helpful.  Let things cool off a bit and hope commonsense takes over."

2021-07-25 19:56:50,Many Americans still don’t know that ending the lines of transmission by what ever means is the only way the pandemic ends. Every time the lines of transmission grow longer by passing from one person to the next is just another day that we will all be forced to live with this disease. Many Americans have no problem making various species of animals extinct but they don’t want to make the coronavirus extinct because they aren’t really all that smart to begin with.
2021-07-25 19:58:49,There are two nice middle-aged ladies working at my neighborhood gas station/mini-mart who have not been vaccinated. They tell me it’s because they are afraid of missing work due to potential side effects of the vaccine. They do not get any paid time off and they say they can’t afford to miss a day’s wages. I’ve tried to assuage their fears but have failed. My guess is that there are millions in a similar situation. Not sure how to reach this group. I hate this situation but cannot hate these two women.
2021-07-25 19:59:52,Let the families of the unvaccinated pay for their medical bills upon death from Covid. Perhaps that will increase their interest in vaccines. Sad that doing the right thing doesn't seem to matter to them.
2021-07-25 20:00:53,"Part of the problem is the ever changing advice, for example I bought tickets to a large event in NYC and when I got the tickets (which were expensive) the organizers and the city were going to require proof of a vaccine for entry and less than 48 hours before the event the city dropped the mask mandate and the organizers dropped the proof of vaccination. I in turn got sick and I got my sister sick, both of us are vaccinated!
I thought the new administration was going to think through their Covid-19 policies but it’s almost as chaotic as it was last year, maybe it’s worse because state and local officials in NY are following the Biden administration’s lead. 
Even though I had already paid for my trip and hotel, I wish I would have canceled my plans. 
I blame myself first but the organizers and the government should have done a better job of protecting us."

I won't waste my breath on these people."

They created this pandemic by refusing to confront it and denying science. Their followers being sadly naive and trusting people, still believe those lies and others. There lay the issue to overcome, GQP propaganda. 
Russians have good reason to not trust their government, though I thin in this case it is wiser to get vaccinated. 

The real culprit of this movement is Andrew Wakefield,living in Texas and still promoting anti vaccine propaganda. 
He was a British doctor who had his license taken away for inventing a fraud scheme about vaccines and autism to make money with a lawyer at a children's birthday party. 
He is still being allowed to profit off this murder by proxy for profit scheme."
2021-07-25 20:06:35,"Most of the red states’ policies are created by politicians under pressure from both Trumpists and business. They all prioritize the economy over public health. All I can say in response to this shortsightedness is that as long as Texas governor G. Abbott continues to forbid cities, businesses, and school districts from enforcing mask mandates or requiring vaccine passports, I will be staying at home and will contribute as little as I can in the way of spending to the economy Texas politicians seem to treasure over the well-being of the citizens of their state. That way I can do my little bit for the health of my fellow human beings — and I really don’t care what happens to the economy any more."
2021-07-25 20:07:03,"I took the vaccine and most folks I know did as well.  But I find it deeply disturbing that people aren’t allowed to question the vaccine and big pharm that has zero skin in the game if any of these vaccines cause injury or death.  The same companies like J&J that injured millions with the likes of baby powder.  Big pharm is driven by money and greed, not by morality and therefore should ALWAYS be questioned."
2021-07-25 20:08:13,"Make not taking it...cost money to the person. Make it like smoking. You pay more for insurance. Make it like if you are caught without car insurance. 

And should you get sick with Covid, its all your expense! Or your family if you die in a hospital setting. Insurance, if you have it, only pays the barest of minimums.

In fact, I think all people who purposely and belligerently reduce their health metrics should be paying more for their medical care and as such insurance. Eat too much, belligerently gain weight, and eat lousy foods and not make efforts to mitigate your health issues...than pay more when you are sick due to such complications. (exception made for a pandemic...but...)

We all want to live in a society where we all contribute to its overall health and well-being. Or so we once believed. But now...apparently there is a fair amount of citizens, esp. those claiming uber-patriotism, no longer want to engage in the many social contracts, be they voluntary or legally required. 

So if they wish to be excluded, we should exclude them from the general benefits of the collective to which they are actively rebelling.  You dont like taking care of your own health, with a free and easily obtained vaccine...well, the rest of us don't want to pay your way when you end up sick.

Lets carve out the exceptions. And make them costly...."

2021-07-25 20:09:09,"Vax or not has been politicized and polarized by all parties with the result that not everyone knows who to believe. That's tragical for the victims and their families, senselessly irresponsible by those who will not grant validity of opposing views, instead continue to exacerbate and increase the harm for personal and ideological gratification.

Vax or not is what's killing people. Whoever keeps the dubious debate at that murderous level is guilty. Stop it or you may be next.

Infections, deaths and hospitalizations are convincing holdouts what to do to save themselves and beloveds. Don't hound them with rage and condescension and preaching, that just entertainingly diverts and helps postpone coming to recognize what needs to be done or live and suffer with the risk.

At worst the holdout bashing will lead to unsettled behavior, smoking, drinking, driving, shooting, beating, same as usual, enriching those who profit from doing bad."
2021-07-25 20:09:14,"It's not just vaccine refusal. It is also mask refusal, social distancing refusal, and the likes of anti-Fauci merch (on sale by DeSantis et al.).

The hatred, violence, and condemnation of people who wish to prevent the spread of the virus is the opposite of freedom. It is bullying and stupidity, masquerading as an ""in crowd"".

The promotion of ignorance and lies is anti-human. This goes for avoidance of honesty about climate and the escalation of weather weirding as well."
2021-07-25 20:09:29,"Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has voiced his skepticism of vaccines, loudly and insistently. Paul is an eye doctor who is willfully blind, and is pulling wool over people's eyes for political gains. Last week during a congressional hearing, Dr. Rand Paul asked a deliberately incorrect and provocative question of Dr. Fauci. A rightfully indignant Fauci told Rand Paul ""You do not know what you are talking about"". Fauci is naive, it was not Dr. Paul, but the politician Paul who was playing to his willfully ignorant base and was not necessarily seeking the truth. 

Rand Paul and his Republican cohorts are making a fight against the virus a politically divisive issue will that is weakening American society. Even if the Republicans come to power through subterfuge and chicanery, they will be ruling over a weakened America that is fast becoming a second rate power compared to China. The virus coming from China is controllable, but US manufactured resistance to inoculations could be fatal to the US."

2021-07-25 20:14:51,"In the beginning you asked us to wash our hands and food and we did like a zealots. Then you said to stay six feet apart and wear a mask and we bought the best masks we could find and wore them for the greater good. Then we were told to just stay home... months alone but we did it because all we needed to do was hang in there until the vaccine came. At every turn that was the deal... we suffer now and the end will come with the vaccines. We are now blessed with multiple highly effective vaccines that, at least in the US, are freely available. 
The people refusing vaccines are largely the same as refused to mask, or to distance and yet somehow now you want us to step back to protect those that choose to be vulnerable, who will almost certainly refuse to mask anyway.  Every unvaccinated person should mask and distance. The rest of us who worked so hard for so long should get on with our lives.
That is the deal asked for and given by the American public."

Possibly having an oral vaccine could be the answer?"
2021-07-25 20:16:41,"Here is the reality:

In a matter of weeks, the US will be back up to hundreds of thousands of people contracting COVID-19 every day. And thousands of people dying every day. Begging, berating, and shaming anti-vaxxers into getting the shot has not worked and will not work. The more we try, the harder they dig in.

While it’s true there are lots a different reasons people are hesitant, one of the main reasons is political. That’s a shame. It’s not a stretch to think that another half a million people could die from this virus over the next year. The vast majority of them will be republicans. This seems like a perverse incentive for anti-vaxxers. “Don’t get the shot and a half million of you may die, causing your political influence to go down.”

Eventually, GOP politicians will figure this out and support the vaccine. If not, their ranks will get thinned year after year as the virus mutates and gets better at spreading and killing.

I just don’t get it."

If it's safe enough for the kids who were able to enroll in the trials (including lots of doctor's kids, etc.), then it's safe enough for my kids.

I do not know what else can be done to convince citizens to get the vaccine!!  My sense is if the delta variant surges across the U.S. many of the unvaccinated will died and/or get extremely sick, requiring very, very expensive ICU/emergency care.

I had high fever for 2 days after ronashot2! (After digging around, I worked out that your chances of getting sick from ronashot2, if under 40, is more like 80% and not 50%, as what the media claims.)

Now that people are foolishly going indoors unmasked, my life is in great danger.  On a few occasions when I have had to wait on a line in a supermarket and an unmasked person has come too close, I have summoned the courage to ask them to back up.

Yes, it is a blanket invasion of privacy but without some form of stepped up mandate we are going to continue to see spikes in cases which expose others, even the vaccinated to infection. And as the effectivity of the original vaccination decreases over time, more and more of those vaccinated will be increasingly vulnerable. Then there is the load on our hospitals in which attention to COVID patients reduces the ability to handle other patients. It becomes an internal triage process between non-COVID and COVID patients. Random stops would have limited effectivity as they could only 'write a ticket', not vaccinate right there on the spot.

What happened if they tried to sneak out? Someone would fink on them to the public health officials, but by then the locals were throwing stones--at the offenders--and chased them back inside.

As if having untreated sick and contagious people left to their own devices in communities would help end the pandemic.

What's surprising is not the number of Americans who haven't been vaccinated  but the Americans who seem shocked at their fellow Americans who are simply living out their ideals of independence and self-reliance.

Let them suffer the consequences of their choices.

I do not understand the US's decision to not issue an official vaccine card.  We should and it should be the 'golden ticket' for attending concerts, sporting events, college classes, etc.   I also believe all health care facilities, universities, etc that receive federal money should require every employee to be vaccinated or lose federal dollars.

Yes, we should have individual rights. Yes, we should have individual freedoms. But at what point does society get to say, “That right or freedom is okay. That other one is not.”

Rules, standards, and laws exist to protect society FROM individuals. In the case of a pandemic, society has every right to demand that individuals are compelled to either be vaccinated or be separated to protect others.

---------
This trope appears daily in the MSM.  There are explanations for why it is occurring but the echo chamber refuses to listen to any explanation that doesn't involve dumb, Trump Republicans.

I remain unvaccinated and will continue to be so.  From my extensive readings, I have concluded that the mRNA vaccine immunity isn't as good as natural immunity, which is being proven correct by the evidence that booster shots are going to be periodically needed to deal with mutations & variants.

Additionally, there have been studies showing that the spike protein that the Covid virus wraps it self with and that the mRNA vaccines generate to attempt to teach the immune system to react to a Covid infection cause vascular damage.  It is unknown if this damage is short or long-term.  Search 'Salk Institute + spike protein' if you want to read details.

Now that you understand where I/we are coming from, that many of us who have decided not to vaccinate isn't simply some arbitrary middle finger back at the government or the NYT echo chamber, can you stop propagating this ""I can't understand"" trope?"

2021-07-25 21:19:20,I wonder at this point if the only way to get Trump devotees to rush to get the vaccine is to use reverse psychology. Maybe the Biden administration should start saying that they welcome Republicans refusing the vaccine because that way they won't have to work so hard to steal the next election since a bunch of unvaccinated Trump voters will be dead. Those blockheads are just gullible enough to swallow it.
2021-07-25 21:21:03,"As I have said before in this venue,  the so-called average American is violent, racist, and not very bright.  We have seen over the past couple of years how truly violent and racist we are, with the deaths to prove it.  Now the stupid part has come to the fore, also with deadly results.

It is now time that we inoculate ourselves from the rank idiocy that has spawned Delta (and possibly Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, and god-knows what else in the future).  We need vaccine passports, corporate and government mandates, or scarlet letters to isolate the non-compliant and protect the rest of us.  Colleges and universities DEMAND vaccines as a prerequisite for registering for classes.  I certainly recall having to get MMR and tetanus shots prior to graduate school so the precedent is well established.  Let's get it done.  Let's stop letting dumb run the show."
2021-07-25 21:21:58,Emergency. Everybody should be forced to take the vaccine even if they have to be held down!￼
2021-07-25 21:17:39,"It’s outrageous that people who will not get vaccinated expect the health care system to always be for there for them. They have no concept that it’s people working to the breaking point to take care of them and they would not be hospitalized needing tremendous amounts of manpower and resources if they would take the dang vaccine. 

It’s so wonderful that unscrupulous individuals can spread disinformation and profit from it too. This should be punished to the full extent of the law. You get what you pay for on social media, you want a free platform, and they get too make tons of money on ignorant people. If fakebook charged everyone a dollar a month, I bet they can do a better job of not publishing garbage and letting disgusting creeps exploit children. I don’t use social media, and I sure didn’t ask for big tech giants to be the “decider”."

2021-07-25 21:35:55,The virus is a Darwinian device to separate fools from their lives. Surely it’s a coincidence that most of them are Republicans.
2021-07-25 21:40:06,"Look. This is as good as it is going to get in this country. With the exception of kids under 12 from already-vaccinated families, and some people who will supposedly be swayed by full FDA approval, it seems clear that this is pretty much the best the US will ever do with Covid vaccines. After a year like 2020 and with Delta, the still-unvaccinated are unreachable. From this point on, we will have annual booster shots for everyone else, a constant trickle of non-lethal breakthrough infections until the next year’s variant’s booster is formulated, and the winters will become “cold, flu, and Covid season.” This country’s current reality is what most other countries still awaiting full vaccine access have to look forward to, unless they can do better, though ultimately the world will only be as protected as its least-vaccinated populations. Essentially, this is it. This is our future. Covid is with us forever, much in its present form."
2021-07-25 21:40:10,"It's WAAAAY past time for the FDA to certify these vaccines, require issuance of universally acknowledged vaccination cards and permit employers to require vaccination cards (or medical exemption documentation) for their employees and customers. Biden's lack of leadership in this has been disappointing."
2021-07-25 21:41:17,"It is time to mandate vaccines, or at least mandate vaccines prior to entering establishments open to the public, transportation, etc. 

I am fully vaccinated and am quarantining right now far from home due to a “breakthrough” infection. I suspect these breakthroughs are very common and like me, typically result in mild cold-like symptoms. I am quarantining because children under 12 still cannot get vaccinations, and I wouldn’t want one of them to get sick on my account. 

A year from now when children will
be vaccinated, I would happily fly home with my mild symptoms, and let those who refuse vaccinations deal with the consequences of their risk taking."
2021-07-25 21:41:53,"My uncle is organizing a family get-together and politely suggested that unvaccinated attendees mask up for the event. I was shocked at the shrill, ALL CAPS, vaccine hostility that a few of my cousins responded with."
2021-07-25 21:46:04,"What amazes me is how difficult it seems for Republicans to just take the win - meaning all these COVID vaccines were developed under the Trump administration, some funded  under Operation Warp Speed, others independently funded, but nonetheless strongly endorsed by the administration, along with promises of mass purchases. 

A small change in messaging would have have completely altered our present reality and probably would have swung the election: 

“I’m getting this vaccine because my President made it for me!”"

GET YOUR VACCINES.  As the Governor of Alabama said, the vaccine refusers are to blame for increasing illness and soon, deaths.  DARN IT.  GET VACCINATED."
2021-07-25 21:46:17,"Forcing people to get the vaccine - mandates - will only work to a point.  Getting the rest of the American people vaccinated requires a massive educational effort.  The vast majority of the unvaccinated have limited education (high school diploma or less) or are not educating themselves about the vaccines.  The cure for this is for the Biden administration to start putting pressure on the biggest social media influencers, ie. the Kardashians/Jenners, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Lebron James, Tom Brady and others, to educate and sell vaccination to their followers. It is nothing short of amazing (and incredibly selfish) that these influencers have not stepped up and even more amazing that the Biden administration has failed to utilize this incredible resource to combat vaccine hesitancy."
2021-07-25 21:47:07,"It is quite clear that the USA missed its window to get this Pandemic substantially behind us by not mandating vaccination for all who were eligible.  Public Health trumps (no pun intended) individual rights.  Our experts should have known about variants likely associated with Coronaviruses and how that would affect the long-term strategy.  We should have been more forceful and could easily have vaccinated the entire country by now.  By pandering to political groups, there will be deaths and other losses for a long time."
2021-07-25 21:47:35,"Had the Pfizer vaccine back in April and just tested positive due to delta variant today. Symptoms are very unpleasant - if these are mild I cannot imagine what it would be like if I was unvaccinated.

2021-07-25 21:39:41,"Ignorance of the law is no defense if you break it. You are still a lawbreaker. 

Ignorance of science also has its consequences. In this case, misery and death inflected on the unvaccinated followed by innocent children, the immunocompromised, the elderly, healthcare workers, people who are quite ill and cannot receive a vaccine.

Those who have politicized science are Trump, the Republicans, the conservative talk show hosts and networks ... ad nauseam. 

Grow up and start taking responsibility for yourself and others! One thing standing in the way, of course, is the arrogance of many conservatives who think they have a corner on the truth. God help us."
2021-07-25 21:49:18,"Let's stop messing around and mandate the vaccine. People who don't take it are either dim or domestic terrorists. They have no right, and in retrospect we'll be astounded that we haven't done so. You can always find reasons not to do things, but there is no moral or practical reason for not cracking down NOW! Only the politically timid and confused are standing in the way."
2021-07-25 21:53:45,"I don’t think much about people who have  a choice and Choose not to get vaccinated.

2021-07-25 21:56:28,"In almost any other time in this country, vaccinations wouldn't even be disputed. But now we're unlucky to be living when the worst virus pandemic in 100 years comes when this country is so divided socially, culturally, and politically that the virus can't be contained. All norms before and after this virus have been attacked because of ""misinformation"" that I like to call propaganda on steroids. This division was fueled (not started) by an American political party that exists for no reasonable purpose other than power, including the power to kill."
2021-07-25 22:00:52,"This is going to be such a slow motion train wreck in our rural communities, and Republican States.  Particularly the Confederate States.  I hope it spurs people to wise up and start protecting themselves (and all of us), but it's a slow-acting vaccine.  

Think about this:  Europe is usually 3-4 weeks ahead of us in case trends, and some countries are seeing cases double every TWO DAYS.  If I remember correctly, Netherlands has a comparable vaccination rate to us, and that's what they're dealing with right now.  

Think of how long it's taken some of our more well vaccinated states to get to around 70%.  How does Louisiana catch up from only 36%?  How does ""catching up"" on shots even look when one considers it will be at least 2 weeks before they see any measurable protection at all, and weeks past that to hit full protection.  

COVID moves incredibly fast, so a lot more can go wrong before people getting today's shots are as protected as (it bears mention) they should have been 3 months ago.  There are likely to be a lot of people getting killed and maimed from this even after they get the shot, just because they got it too late for it to kick in. 

And that delay in the vaccine's protection will be a point of disinformation. Most of the unvaccinated aren't intelligent enough to understand how it works, and will say it doesn't work if they get sick. How does that impact further vaccine adoption?

This is going to get so much worse before it get better."
2021-07-25 22:01:23,"Though perhaps improbable, I am not certain why health/medical insurance companies are not ""demanding"" that their customers show proof of vaccination. I understand that not everyone has insurance, but certainly those who do and either waver or refuse vaccination, should be dropped or suffer a significant rate increase. I know that I would be incentivized if I was going to lose my insurance, or have a substantial rate increase."
2021-07-25 22:03:24,If you have been offered the vaccine but not had it you should be responsible for any medical costs from COVID if you get sick.
2021-07-25 22:04:46,"Millions of people have been vaccinated and they are not the ones who are dying. 

The folks who have NOT been vaccinated are the ones who get seriously ill and some of them die. 

The latest statistics suggest that almost all the people dying of COVID-19 were NOT vaccinated 

How hard is it to figure out that getting vaccinated is better than getting sick and dying?"
2021-07-25 21:56:06,"It is time for President Biden to address the nation and explain in blunt terms that the perpetuation of the virus in the U.S. is entirely the fault of those who refuse to vaccinate, as well as Trump, Republicans, and media like Fox who politicized it and continue to politicize it while spreading lies and disinformation.

Will that do any good?  Who knows?  But at least lay the marker down and place the blame where it squarely belongs.

The majority of us who sacrificed, exhibited caution, played by the rules and recommendations, masked up, and enthusiastically got our vaccinations when they were available have had enough.   We are bloody sick and tired of being held hostage by a willfully ignorant minority of propagandized fools who cannot think their way out of a wet paper bag."

Sure, the pandemic is rebounding, I guess, because not everyone's vaccinated.  That's not a real helpful way to look at it, though.  The pandemic is only part of people's lives, and vaccines are personal decisions.  Instead of bemoaning vaccination rates, just pivot and find a worldview that works with where we're at:  the starting point that we're ""undervaccinated"" is a non-starter for those who aren't getting vaccinated.  Liberals always champion differences, until people disagree with them."
2021-07-25 21:44:17,"We now have a new and horrifying problem with homegrown terrorists in this country. It is the tens of millions of vaccine refuseniks, I guess I will call them ""Americans,"" who knowingly practice a crude form of biological warfare against their fellow citizens and even their own family members. Somebody needs to call Homeland Security, not the CDC, because we are under siege."
2021-07-25 22:04:29,"The unvaccinated are infringing on my freedoms. They are prolonging the agony of the pandemic.

2021-07-25 22:07:00,"About masks: 
They mitigate spread. It’s a mistake to think that you’re fine because everyone else around you seems to think so and is walking about barefaced. Cool.

2021-07-25 22:10:19,"I have had both vaccines and would recommend anyone to get their shot, but. I would also like to question why is it that the therapeutics that are out there to treat this virus are not being talked about? The caveat  to these therapeutics is early detection with a high degree of success. These drugs have been around for a long time and have the data to support their medical efficacy."
2021-07-25 22:12:59,"Unless we are a completely insane country, there will come a time in the near future when the pandemic overwhelms us, our health care community and more people die, including children. 

So, we can wait until the screaming for help overwhelms us and policy makers will have to mandate vaccinations. Those who refuse should be temporarily relocated to a place reserved for them and if they get sick or die, it's their choice.  They must not be allowed to destroy the lives of their neighbors and fellow citizens.  
Certainly, those with relevant medical conditions should exempted from the vaccine.

We can choose to wait until the screaming and massive infections and deaths are here - because it will happen. Or we can do this now and prevent massive suffering foisted on us by those who choose ignorance, choose to believe the incredible lies being told by the liars and fools.

This is where real leaders must lead.  Unfortunately leadership is virtually absent in one of America's major political parties. I will go out of my way to say thank you to Mitch McConnell, Mitt Romney and a few others in their party. for telling the truth on this life and death issue.  

I implore Mitch and Mittand other leaders to use their voices every day, in all media to call out the liars and fools (trump and Carlson are a  good start).

Get vaccinated or get put somewhere where you cannot kill others."

The truth is that COVID-19 was created as a bioweapon by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party. 

The evidence is overwhelming and it’s obvious. 

Tell Americans this simple truth and everyone will get vaccinated. Nothing brings people together like a common enemy."

Our collective future depends on it."
2021-07-25 22:18:44,"The refusniks show contemptible cowardice IF in fact they think they can betray their family, friends an neighbors and somehow be a vanguard for truth, twisted as it and they may be.

India, with its huge population of nearly 1.4 billion, has only a small percentage of its people vaccinated and has had little success in shutdowns.

So, how did it overcome (in great part) its huge delta surge? Did the virus just wear itself out? Did it find not enough fresh victims in which to conduct its murderous replication? Will the same thing happen in the U.S.?"

What about the resistance to vaccines already being displayed by Delta as far as opportunistic infections? The anti-science, anti-Democrat, anti government, anti-authority and so forth other morons placing this country at risk need to be dealt with en masse. It is a war and the mentioned groups-and others-are the enemy and they are killing thousands and thousands of Americans. Hold them accountable. Let them get covid. And when they ask for the vaccine on their death beds, well...One more thing: in war there are no innocent victims, only victims. Except for the deniers. They are neither innocent nor victims. They are enemy combatants and are far as I'm concerned they can be shipped to Guantanimo (SP?). Enough is enough. Hold these stupid arrogant detritus accountable."

Those adults who haven’t been vaccinated yet - get vaccinated now, there is no shortage of vaccine for you, and it is extremely irresponsible not to get vaccinated to help yourself and other Wisconsin citizens.  Without these measures Wisconsin will be in big trouble, even though we have one of the best records of vaccinations in the U.S. in part related to Gov. Evers leadership and the hard work of our healthcare team and medical administration coordination with hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, and the Wisconsin public.  Other governors and States should follow our example.  This is urgent.  Allowing COVID to rampage will only lead to further viral strains which could be resistant to present vaccines.

It is time restrict unvaccinated people from spaces and events. Enjoying such privileges during a health crisis requires responsibility to ensure you pose no threat to others. Contain yourselves at home when you get sick. Dedicated healthcare workers shouldn’t have to risk their lives for you. You have all the information you need.

They feel a lot like the ""we talked to a Trump supporter in a diner"" articles from a few years ago, and are just as pointless. At the end of the day we don't need to understand why they aren't getting the vaccine. Rather, *they need to get the vaccine.* That's it.

It's time to stop coddling the antivaxxers, who are providing a vast petri dish for the virus as it evolves toward a variant that can evade the vaccine. They are not only putting unvaccinated children at risk: they are putting everyone at risk. And they are the reason we still can't get back to ordinary life."
2021-07-25 22:46:34,"Traveling across my state of North Carolina I saw many signs of the virus even in the small town we were visiting.  our reservation at a local restaurant was canceled due to a sudden outbreak in unvaccinated employees.  My church filled with vaccinated worshippers held its first in person gathering in a year in a half, everyone masked and distanced though almost everyone was vaccinated.  Today we had lunch at an establishment packed with unmasked people though the staff was masked.  At this restaurant a struggling senior limping but masked  mopped the floors and bused the tables.  She told us she had to do it to pay the rent or go hungry.  Vaccinated she worked on.  We have two Americas now and this time the unvaccinated will feel the brunt of their own irresponsibility.  And the rest of us  can pray that breakthrough cases will go easy on us."
2021-07-25 22:47:55,It's time for insurance companies to step up. They need to announce to their customers that treatment for Covid will only be covered if the customer received the vaccine. Customers who could have got the vaccine but didn't will be responsible for their own treatment costs.
2021-07-25 22:48:43,"Simply refuse hospital treatment for anyone who has not been vaccinated by October   first. In addition cancel all welfare, Medicare , and  social security payments to anyone who has not been vaccinated by November first . It is that simple. We can not afford the costs of being dragged down by unvaccinated citizens."
2021-07-25 22:43:14,"Unvaccinated people should be assigned to separate wards in hospitals.    They should only be allowed to expose each other to this deadly disease, and they should be charged higher fees for the risks taken by medical staff and the extra care and equipment needed to keep them alive.    Enough already."
2021-07-25 22:39:36,"I don’t think people should be forced to get vaccinated. If/when a refusenik gets Covid, his/her name should be put on a wait list for people needing a mechanical ventilator or any other treatment for Covid, and kept their until hospital ERs and Covid wards are completely empty for lack of non-refusenik patients. Additionally, I think medical insurance should cost them substantially more."

2021-07-25 23:02:32,"I think as many of the contributors do, that collective solidarity should trump [forgive the use of the word] individualist doubts about the vaccine, many of said doubts to be ill-informed or based on bizarre conspiracy theories.
   Imagine this scenario: a healthy forty-year-old male comes down with a mild case of the virus, and recovers without the need for hospitalization. However, he has also passed the virus onto his children and parents, and his children and parents contract lethal cases of the virus, and all die. Their blood would be on his hands.

I thought it might change his mind about the economic consequences of Fox News and his fellow Republicans undermining the vaccination effort. His response:  Always blaming Republicans . . . it’s Blacks who are refusing to get vaccinated.  How do you argue with such ignorance and racism?
2021-07-25 23:09:58,If the unvaccinated want to harm themselves so be it but it will be a terribly sad  thing if even one vaccinated person whether it be caused by a chance encounter with an unvaccinated person or a healthcare worker gets seriously ill or dies from Covid
2021-07-25 23:06:28,Perhaps it is time for insurance companies to refuse to cover people who do not get vaccinated. I certainly do not want to see my premiums go to providing care for individuals who do not take basic care of them selves.

As part of a research study run through my hospital, I’ve been taking home antibiotics tests monthly. I took a test this Thursday; the results show I no longer have antibodies. Many of my colleagues are also reporting they lack antibodies. We were all in the first wave of the vaccinated and of course, will face considerable risk of infection from those who show up to the hospital ill because they decided not to vaccinate. This is maddening."

Almost 50 million more Americans will become eligible once vaccines for kids are approved, which will help keep numbers down. 
The FDA seems to want to wait til mid-winter. Why not grant emergency authorization as soon as humanly possible after results for the trials are available? Those parents who are worried can still wait til mid-winter, after enough other kids have gotten vaccinated, to get theirs vaccinated. But parents who are eagerly awaiting the chance for a vaccine for their kids should be able to get access ASAP."
2021-07-25 23:18:31,"Same story in France and other parts of the world.

* Greatly facilitated misinformation and spreading of antivax rumors, thanks notably to the internet and social networks.
* The Trump presidency has brought a new era of alternative facts and shameless lies, globally. The GOP is only perpetuating this tendency. The Beacon of Freedom has become a Beacon of Lies. It's not so much about Trump, but the realization that liars just get away with it, and there are no limits.
* Lack of confidence in institutions, because of many factors, notably economic uncertainty, perceived inequalities, and perceived downgrading.
* Lack of confidence in the future, which has brought a kind of nihilism: after us the deluge.
* Not a very good communication from medical authorities, who have given contradictory recommendations. Possibly because of the evolution of scientific knowledge about the virus, but for the general public it's not easy to grasp.
* Fear of a vaccine perceived as not yet ready for distribution, while the virus is perceived as not very dangerous for oneself.
* Selfishness: why get vaccinated if it's to protect others?
* People tend to believe what they would like to be true. The same is known with climate change. When a quack says what people want to hear, they trust him. It's irrational, but it's how we humans tend to react.
* We are far too spoiled. We have so much that any constraint, even justified, is perceived as an unbearable violation of freedom.
* Mere recklessness."

2021-07-25 23:17:55,"America is one of the few countries with enough vaccines at its disposal to protect every resident — and yet it has the highest rates of vaccine hesitance or refusal of any nation except Russia.

Since the beginning of the vaccination program starting with our order for 100,000,000 for 50,000,000 million people in June of 2020 and then trials and then FDA emergency use authorization starting in December 2020, and then distribution logistics....and today at the end of July 2021, eight months later....eight months and where's the cure.

Not to long ago we were looking/asking for no patent rights in order to inoculate the poorer countries people's around the world, to help slow the spread. What was done about this and the reactions from the makers of the vaccinations.

This is a global pandemic not a outbreak in just individual countries around the globe.

And who is paying these companies that the US is now only sending vaccinations to these poorer countries. The people in these countries are also helping to spread this and the variants to spread globally. 

Open up the world to the vaccinations, because every time a country opens it's economies, the cases/deaths begin to increase again, almost as soon as they are re-opened. And heavily curtail the traveling businesses in particular."
2021-07-25 23:18:09,"Perhaps the government should incentivize vaccination by paying everyone who gets the vaccine $1,400."
2021-07-25 23:20:13,"When you live in a covenantal community like the US, you’d like to believe that we have each other’s backs. When a person refuses to get vaccinated the virus will continue to spread and mutate. With each mutation there is a high risk that the vaccines we have won’t work. When that happens, we’re all back to square one: masks, closures, sickness, and death. If you really understand what it means to be American, get vaccinated. It’s the only way to show that you believe in the American experiment of a covenantal community, where we each have each other’s backs."
2021-07-25 23:17:35,"The UK's cases peaked 6 days ago and are falling rapidly.  Roughly speaking, it is 45 days from the start of a wave to its peak.  This suggests that in a state such as Texas, the peak in cases will be in about two weeks.  By the way--in Texas, the hardest hit counties are the border counties down by Laredo and Del Rio.  I wonder why?"
2021-07-25 23:21:35,"There was an article earlier this week mentioning a woman who waited to be vaccinated until she found an incentive that motivated her to get a shot (a card with some amount of cash). Certainly there are many more like her who would probably be enticed by similar gifts/prizes. I also think there should be assurances made to the throngs of undocumented workers in the US that there will be no repercussions for showing up to a vaccnination site. The government should strongly encourage all employees be vaccinated and help employers pay a stipend to workers for any days off needed to recover from shots (like payment for jury duty). Finally, the various and diverse communities across our country do need to hear from trusted spokespersons who share their identities and who trust science over fear and outright misinformation."

	Well, that about covers it, don't you think?  The carrot has failed – it couldn't survive the criminal stupidity of the right. So now it's time for the stick – in the form of mandates at school and work to hit people where they live. Get yourself vaccinated or stay home. No school. No pay check. Otherwise:  “The country may again see overflowing hospitals, exhausted health care workers and thousands of needless deaths.”  

Forget the “may.”  How many have already needlessly died?"

   Since 69% of seniors (65 and up) are vaccinated, that means only about 20-25% of those under 65 are vaxxed.
   I know I have some protection with two doses of Moderna, but at age 70, I don’t want to take any chances. I guess I’ll have to become a hermit until everyone is recovered or dead."
2021-07-25 23:33:26,"The effort to persuade needs to end.  Time to implement restrictions on those who can't show proof they've been vaccinated.  A certain percentage of Americans simply won't do the right thing when given the choice.  But when confronted with consequences such as the inability to go to indoor restaurants/bars, concerts, theaters, sport events, gyms and other indoor places/activities they end their resistance.  Europe has realized this and is beginning to move forward in this manner.  It will be up to each state to do this, but if enough states do it our national compliance rate will be sufficient for herd immunity."
2021-07-25 23:37:35,"This is a threat only because we own it, we indulge the large segment of parasitic losers called republicans.  Most don't pay any (hardly any) income tax.  Most live in red states that are parasites on the federal government.  Most take federal hand outs.  Most are on some sort of government assistance (and tax cheating, all these great business owners - single owner operated businesses who pay next to nothing).  Most are whites, and they get away with outrageous behavior because we cannot and do not produce consequences for them.

How about we stop the federal handouts, the ethanol and farm subsidies, lock up the meth heads, take away their cell phones and driving licenses (keep your guns), and refused entry into hospitals when sick unless they leave a deposit of $100,000 - which otherwise the taxpayer has to pay on their behalf for their self indulgent refusal to take the vaccines.

It is time for America to say: 'enough..  No more privileges.  You are not special.  Vote for Trump, deny gravity if you want, but the rest of us are going to plain cancel you.  No more access to anything, and go stand in line.  You know?

It is sad that it has come to this but seems to be the last tool in the tool box for those who believe all manner of misinformation or are simply stubborn. I see others recommending mandates but high officials on the right have blocked that approach in many states. It is now time for the ""doubting Thomas"" to simply witness the devastation of losing family members, people they know, or even their own lives. A lot of us have simply grown tired of trying to convince others to save their own lives. Sad but true..."

We still fail to grasp that we are in the middle of an “Information War” via memes and faulty medical studies that systematically target vulnerable populations and kill them. Much cheaper that military hardware. Putin would love to see our society crumble like theirs did after the Berlin wall fell.  The Russians have PHDs on American society and despise us.
2021-07-25 23:42:17,"Most of the unvaccinated at this point are Republicans.  I'm going to posit that the reason they haven't gotten vaccinated yet is because they aren't being spoken to in the language of their people.  We have been talking to them about the benefits to the community, to their families, how it will protect them, how it will promote health, etc....

This is appealing to community spirit, which is not something that the Republican mind understands.  We need to talk exclusively about the benefits to them, since that is all they care about.  Explain that they will be protected from death and hospitalization, and how that will help them to storm the Capitol again.

In seriousness, we need to talk to Republicans like they talk to others.  Explain to the unvaccinated how they are free riders on society, and how we've been carrying them this past year.  And we can explain that we have a new solution to this problem.  The solution will be that COVID is no longer required to be covered by insurance.  The solution needs to go further, too.  Vaccine passports should be developed specifically to enter clinics and hospitals.  After all, why should the real Americans that are doing their part have to pay more for or forego their own medical care so that we can keep accommodating the laziest among us?"

2021-07-25 23:45:02,A major part of the problem is the antivaxxer and anti-authority movements in many parts of this country but another unfortunate element is the changing definitions of vaccine protection parameters and severity of illness.  People are 'dazed and confused' by the moving of the goalposts and the use of new terminology such as 'vaccinated people are relatively protected from severe illness and death' which was used today by a one of our most noted authorities on the virus.  We need and should demand clarity and transparency from our leaders and that would go a long way towards the ultimate goal of achieving some sort of herd immunity primarily through vaccination and other public health recommendations.
2021-07-25 23:45:17,"Getting vaccinated is a personal choice.  It’s also a personal choice to go into a Walmart, a Target, a supermarket, eat in a restaurant, or get on an airplane.  How about those of us that are vaccinated refuse to enter any business, or allow anyone into our home to provide a service, unless they are vaccinated? I bet businesses would be a lot more receptive to getting their employees vaccinated.  My F20 employer requires vaccinations to work in the office, and you need to show your vaccination card.  Oh, and all remote work ends on September 15.  Your choice, get vaccinated and come to the office or you’ll end up terminated for not working. Need an exception?  You and your doctor note need to make an appointment with HR, where it will be scrutinized.  Harsh? Maybe, but better than being dead."

2021-07-25 23:49:54,"As an immunocompromised patient whose two jabs of Pfizer were inadequate, I have this to say to the CDC: 

Immunocompromised people who did the right thing are dying because you care more about the politics of how a booster may look to anti-vaxers than you do about saving innocent lives.  Innocent blood on your hands.  

And having medically unsound policies for manipulative reasons ultimately backfires by diminishing the credibility of the agency.  Immoral AND dumb.  Step up and do the medically correct thing in the medically correct timing!  Booster access for the immunocompromised NOW."
2021-07-25 23:50:28,"All the reasons we hear for not getting the shot—skepticism about safety and/or efficacy, or time constraints—are mere excuses, in my opinion. The real, underlaying reasons fall into two categories, which may overlap:

1. Many of those who've not gotten the shot are grown adults still chafing at parental authority. What bigger parent surrogate than the federal government?

2. Many of them are simply signaling loyalty to their peer group, whether it be Trumpian white nationalists, or black or brown minorities. 

Frankly, I’ve lost patience. It’s time for health passes, such as just mandated in France and Italy. You want to participate in society and the economy in a meaningful way—eat in a restaurant, go to a sports event, or travel by plane or train—then you need to show your health pass that attests you've been fully vaccinated.

Wrong. What we found is a huge anti-vax population. I met a woman who actually bragged that her baby almost died from the flu: ""At least she's not vaxxed with poison, dying of the flu will be natural!""  Just like in Dixie, where I assume all folks were extreme conservative and hates the libs until proved otherwise, here I assume everybody here is anti-vax until proven otherwise.  It's a policy that keeps things calmer.

Yesterday I was chatting with a couple I had just met who were stating how much they believed in science. Against my policy, I mistakenly thought they might be rational. I mentioned the advancement of vaccine science and my relief at having received the Moderna vaccine. It went from a pleasant chat to them yelling at me instantly about how stupid I am and how God *literally* tells them it's the vaccine itself that gives Covid. There was no reasoning ""Hey let's agree to disagree"" or even trying to change the subject so I tried to politely flee. They followed me to my car, berating me. That threat of violence again for disagreeing.

I know the use of logic is fruitless, but these same people will accept treatments such as monoclonal antibodies once they are sick. If they have reservations about a vaccine, shouldn't they have reservations about many of the available treatments?

The obvious answer is that they have to be shut out of regular society until they take the vaccine. They may choose to hurt themselves, and I'm not really fine with that, but their  obstinance may very well hurt millions of others. That is unacceptable."
2021-07-25 23:54:29,"ZERO sympathies…. Darwin in action.

Yes, many of these people are going to die or possibly suffer lifelong health issues due to Covid.  This will be their penalty for refusing to accept the truth and science behind vaccines.

The part that upsets those who are vaccinated is that these anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theory wackos are: (1) Covid carriers/spreaders, (2) holding back the return to normalcy, (3) damaging the economic recovery.

They care little about our Country , our Democracy or the community…. It’s is all about THEM and their supposed freedom of choice.  These people are SELFISH…

I challenge the companies advertising on FOX news, who have enabled Carlson, Ingraham, Hannity, etc. -- all Murdoch minions -- to spread disinformation and death, to hold them personally accountable by pulling their advertising and shutting FOX down.  Their endless, counter-factual drivel is going to wreck the USA (as well as all other conservative deniers in the media pulpit).

Vaccine hesitancy is not just based on politics, and it is affecting both blue and red states. New York's vaccination campaign has ground almost to a halt.

This comparison with our next door neighbor shows how serious the problem is:

New coronavirus cases on July 22:
Canada: 2,484 (adjusted for population)
U.S.: 63,711

I think that the difference above is due both to vaccination hesitancy and lower compliance with behavioral guidelines.

Increase in fully vaccinated population, all ages, last week:
Canada: 6.5%
U.S.: 0.5%

Canada has already passed the U.S. on full vaccination and appears to have lots of momentum.

Ordering on the ""honor system"" that people unvaccinated mask up is a joke. If they won't do the right thing with one behaviour why would they with another.

I've moderated popular discussion groups for years at a public venue. But they will not resume because the city will NOT require vaccination proof. So those vaccinated say they will not return in fall. Neither will I. The minority will prevail.

CDC estimates that around 1 in 4 Americans have already had a Covid infection. There is little doubt that a past infection provides significant immunity although repeat infections do happen.  As Covid spreads rapidly among the unvaccinated with the Delta variant,  the number of unvaccinated people without a past infection is dropping. A back of the envelope calculation shows that the number of adults  with significant immunity due to the vaccine or a past infection should be around 80%, and increasing steadily. So the end may be in sight after all, even if it is a more painful finish than was necessary."

2021-07-26 00:49:29,"If the private company called Delta Airlines, as an example, announced that it would no longer admit to its premises (read airplanes) any person not fully vaccinated, it would probably increase their business as passengers concerned about COVID 19 would re-book from other airlines to Delta. As that happens other major carriers (American, United, Southwest among them) would move to implement the same policy to maintain their bottom line.


The net result could well be the vaccination of another 15% or more of the US population thus helping to stop the surely unnecessary deaths we are witnessing from false information about the safety and effectiveness of these remarkable lifesaving vaccines against COVID19.


It is very important that US private businesses (not government entities), such as these airlines, follow the lead of universities such as Indiana University and the University of California in standing up for public safety and our public health.

The point is that I am not fighting for my life or worse and I credit that to having a previous infection and vaccine exposure!

If you stay home, nobody else will know, or care, if you're vaccinated. If you go out without having been vaxxed, and you get caught, your choice is: get vaxxed, right now, or go to jail until you change your mind. 

Worried about the jails overflowing? It's a funny thing, but Republicans don't like being in jail any more than the rest of us. Make the threat, they'll get vaxxed, we'll all (including them) be better off, and the jails won't fill up after all.

Unlike the rest of you, I believe in science, which is filled with qualifications because research reveals narrow truths and it is dishonest to fill in the blanks with made up stuff. 

There are more blanks than certainties concerning virus spread. But one of the certainties is that there are multiple routes to the end of the pandemic. Through history, there have been countless pandemics. And all but a few ended without a vaccine. There are probably 100 ways to end this thing, some of which may be more effective than a colossally unpopular vaccine. 

There. is too little research into past pandemics and there are countless autocrats who call for shoving the vaccine down the throats of the unwilling. 

The refusal to do the research reflects the fact that there are millions of obnoxious people who prefer to have their way rather than accepting reality and going back to the drawing board. 

There are statistical studies that analyze the course of the disease which suggest that its course is determined by measurable factors which suggests targeted strategies other than vaccination might end this mess. But the effort to condemn is greater than the effort to solve the problem.  So inevitable failure of the vaccine is the only strategy we’ve got."

from getting considerably worse in all these under vaccinated

But that is surely what it will take. Reason and a sense of the common  good have been co-opted. 

We are witnessing  the destruction of a 
foundational pillar for  any functioning democracy, that is,
a core belief that authorities and the population they
serve through democratic institutions will gain from  mutual
trust, and a  level of cooperation that is an  acknowledgment of legitimacy. 

When state and county public health directors are incapable of getting the minimal amount of    cooperation to help contain a major crisis, you know that  you are seeing the signs of  a society at a breaking point, one that is undergoing a  type of psychotic break with reality.  

As a result what will be will be and, unfortunately, too
many just can't care less.

In such a context  the reluctance of

The main reason why the delta variant is flourishing in this country is because of agenda pushing, false information passed off as impartial, factual information over the past 15 months on social media. The whole idea of a vaccine is not to prevent you from getting infected if exposed to a viral agent, but rather to lessen it's effects. For example, if a person gets a flu vaccine during flu season, it doesn't mean that they can't get the flu. What it means is that the effects of the flu will be such that instead of one being seriously sick for a week, one might be mildly sick for a couple of days. I blame Republicans that continue to approve the cutting of funding to public schools which ultimately prevents Americans from properly learning basic biology at a young age."

It seems that states and localities have been offering economic incentives to the unvaccinated to entice them to change their ways. That doesn't seem to be working. All right, it's time to move to the other motivator, fear.

A good assumption to start is that most anti-vax folks are Republicans. What appeals to Republicans?  Here are three things: 1) America was better in the past than it is today; 2) Authoritarianism has its good points; and 3) Money and wealth are good.  So, let's appeal to those traits with fear, as opposed to greed. Here we go...

1) Individuals opposed to vaccine will henceforth wear a necklace with large, embroidered, letters ""UNVACC"" appropriately stitched with scarlet thread.

2) Send the dissenting unvaccinated to Siberia, as the old Russians and Soviets did. In our case, that would mean Alaska, above the Arctic Circle. Out of sight, out of mind. 

3) Establish a private company, funded by government grants, to employ bounty hunters to identify all unvaccinated citizens so that both action steps above may be implemented.

Too tough? Not tough enough? Is it time to vote yet?"

It's the rise of religious orthodoxies that encourage a complete abandonment of reason, instead embracing an irrational xenophobia of science and fact.

It's religion.

No longer at its worst benign, religion has become a force of destruction.  The republican party has exploited the infantile credulity of the religious right as a cover for their servility to corporations and their relentless need for profit at any cost.

I am so tired of hearing about vaccine hesitancy as people throughout the world continue to heavily suffer with the rampages of Covid.  I truly believe this group is not going to budge on this issue and we may need to move on.  Let's start thinking about the people who want to be vaccinated and help them.  Should we just sit and watch the continent of Africa be brought down to its knees?  And there are so many other countries in Central, South America, Asia and the US' own neighbor Mexico  who are under vaccinated."

They are keeping me housebound at this point. They like to talk about their liberty, but they’ve taken away my liberty. They talk about personal responsibility and consequences. It’s time for them to experience the consequences of their actions and inactions. I’d like to see the Biden Administration recommend masking indoors, and require masks on any form of public transportation and places of public accommodations. Businesses of all kinds, please require staff to be vaccinated and consumers to be masked, indoors everywhere and outdoors in crowded areas."
2021-07-26 01:42:24,the unvaccinated expect us to honor their decision and see our to keep talking about it as patronizing.   But who will outline the importance  of the vaccine if we were all to stop pressing the issue.  Would the unvaccinated  listen if with one voice their leaders called for vaccination?  Even Trump will not call for vaccinations despite his private shots as he fears losing their votes.  the only answer is monetary insurance sanctions  and the denial of participation at  events they enjoy and demand.  Is it legal?  For public health emergencies we can and must do it.
2021-07-26 01:51:15,"Adults who have never had COVID before or never been fully immunized before should willingly get vaccinated against COVID for their own good and the good of others. I would so far as to say that not getting vaccinated is as self destructive as smoking a pack a day or excessive drinking or walking in some parts of urban America. Yesterday, I was so happy that a person I know got his first shot after trying to convince him for several months to get fully immunized. I feel bad now that I upset him by asking him whether he detected a nano chip being inserted during the shot. 

Vaccine hesitancy and refusal is not a partisan issue, it is an individual issue that has built up from the mistrust of the big pharma and the public health establishment. We need a movement like friends don't let friends drive drunk where proper counseling is done by trusted friends so that the root cause of rising infection rates is uprooted with gentle persuasion. 

About the additional vaccine dose, I would hope that it is specifically against the delta variant or a combination against all variants and as before without a nano chip (joke)."

In my county, the number of Covid cases really boomed and got hugely worse starting in July 2020 (4th of July get togethers?) and fell way off by June 2021.  Currently, the growth slope of the July 2020 and July 2021 graphs is remarkably similar.  My ""mask relaxation"" definitely is over."

One get the shot, or two be immediately sent to processing out, whatever your rank or privilege.  Next are the raft of federal cops with a similar order.

Something similar happened about 1946 when Truman racially integrated the army by edict, a marvelous idea.

After the military gets vaccinated, towns and other entities around the country will fall in and order police, fire and ambulance to do the same, closely followed by public schoolteachers."

Biden's failure to issue a vaccine mandate ,or even to issue a mask mandate can't be blamed on Trump.
 
I didn't expect  more from Trump.   Trump never pretended to be anyone else. His mishandling of the pandemic was to be expected. 

I did expect more from Biden.


President Biden has suffered  unimaginable tragedy and loss.  He knows what it's like to lose a wife, an infant daughter, and a son. 

He has the ability to ensure that other Americans don't know what it's like to lose a spouse, child or other loved one to  COVID by mandating the  vaccine.

It's well past the time for Biden to ACT, so that other Americans don't have to suffer from the terrible losses and anguish from which he has suffered."

The government has mandated vaccines in the past. 

My rights as a vaccinated person count just as much as your right as an unvaccinated one. Every unvaccinated person brings the risk of new variants. The latter may very well, sooner or later, take a form which will overcome vaccines putting us all, once again, at grave risk.  If our government, driven by spineless Republicans who fear their base more than they feel the virus (which makes them fools as well), then private businesses and schools must step up with mandates.

As the article states, the unvaccinated will ""set the country on fire again and again"".

Public health professionals and doctors currently fighting the unwinnable battle of idiocy in red states are going to need to be recruited to move to live and work in sane (blue) states, to defend them against incursion from the increasingly infectious ‘variant factories’ that are the anti-science red states.

We will need to draw a ‘cordon sanitaire’ around those states, to prevent them from dragging us all down into an endless pandemic.  This is where the culture war has brought us.

States are going to have to decide what kind of people (and associated behaviors) they want to be populated by abs associated with.
Businesses are going to have to decide what sort of customers they want to have.  For example, if a store or restaurant wants sane, civilized, (likely more successful, wealthier) customers it will have to enforce a mask requirement or a vaccine passport in order to ensure they all feel comfortable indoors.

The schism between the states is beginning.

I only know of one Republican friend who has not been vaccinated, yet in places like Albany NY and NYC, places that are vastly Democratic, the vaccinated numbers are low.  Many minorities are afraid to take the vaccine.
Remember all the hype months ago about that terrible Tuskegee trial  and the repeated reminders of minorities who were mistreated at that time? Anyone wonder that perhaps it scared more people? 
I can understand that...and the lag with the FDA certainly is not helping.
It would not make sense to mandate ANYTHING that has not been approved by them yet.
It would make sense for them to publish something explaining why it has not been approved, hopefully that will help some people get the vaccine.

It also doesn't help that the messaging constantly changes.

Vaccine hesitancy will be overcome when the hesitant understand that it will have economic consequences for them personally. 
Turn off the federal spigot that covers the costs of medical care. Have the health insurance companies increase premiums for the unvacinated.

2021-07-26 13:16:21,"A couple of stray thoughts:

Attacks on vaccination are as old as the procedure. A prominent one a hundred-odd years ago was George Bernard Shaw, who was a smart man, but not smart enough to know when he didn't know what he needed to know. He was one of those people who didn't know the difference between a sound argument and a valid one.

The problem with valid arguments is that it's garbage in, garbage out. Just because the logic works doesn't mean that the conclusion is true.

And there's the rub: When it come to assessing risk, it's easy to reason correctly to a false conclusion. Applied statistics is all  about the odds, and we have a distressing tendency to over-estimate the odds of rare events. And the rarer they are, the more likely we think they are. Such as lottery wins and vaccine side-effects.

So it seems that what will (likely) make a difference  is the personal experience of people that matter to the vaccine-hesitant. There will be lot more of that, and it will change people's minds. But at a terrible cost."
2021-07-26 13:16:51,"I'm vaccinated, but for the open-minded observer there are many reasons for cognitive dissonance in the ways these vaccines have been developed and distributed. Consider: if it is true that vaccinating the entire world is necessary to protect the world, it makes absolutely no sense that we have chosen to protect patent rights, thereby creating global vaccine scarsity and increasing costs. It's hypocritical to villify those who are unvaccinated but give a pass the vaccine profiteers whose policies decrease access to vaccines in all but the richest nations. And then there is the issue of the mobile goal posts: ""The vaccines are 95% effective"" we are told, so we think we're protected against infection. Oops. It turns out we're not 95% protected against infection, but we're assured (for now) that we're 95% protected against getting severely ill. Well, that's a different proposition, isn't it? I understand that the scientific understanding of both the virus and the vaccines is developing. But if the fact that we're still learning justifies adjustments to our expectations, why does it not also justify skepticism?"

The risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness are clear, yet we have destroyed the lives of a generation of children for the benefit of a relatively few adults.

 First, we must charge every elected official who is not supporting a fix.

Both elected officials swear that the Corona virus is nothing more than the regular flu and as such should not require any related restrictions of us which could benefit us. As a result, they support the inevitable increases in related deaths, deaths which would be preventable. Hence, they, like the mafia godfathers, should be held accountable and as a result be personally charged as being accessories of a murder and for a lot of murders. This would fix the lying side of those who oppose treating this threat properly. Second, every local Chamber of Commerce should begin to work directly with every business and create a system where they all work together to deal with this issue. Collectively, every business could mandate every one of their employees are vaccinated and if they all agree their employees would have to get vaccinated or lose their jobs and if these businesses all work together in dealing with this issue alone there would not be an incentive for their employees to jump ship and get another job. This approach would make a significant influence on getting all of us out of this mess which is only going to get worse as we do nothing on a national basis which affects the local related problem. Which of our government officials want to take this approach?"

According to kff.org. 48 percent of White Americans have received one dose, but 41 percent of Hispanics and 36 percent of Blacks have received at least one dose. These are huge differences. The vaccines are free. Minorities disproportionately live in cities, where medical care is more accessible. Who is refusing to get vaccinated?"

This is a psychological phenomenon; it feels good to be ""in the know."" It is empowering and thus extremely valuable to the individual on many levels.

That is simply an incontrovertible fact, and it should not be swept under the carpet while trying to be “fair” about vaccine hesitancy.

2021-07-26 15:20:53,The vaccination situation is definitely colored by politics and probably religion. Here in Canada we have reached 80% of 12 years and over with one dose and should reach a similar figure fully vaccinated by mid August. However the two most conservative provinces lag 10% behind despite availability for all across the country. Fortunately these provinces are only 15% of the population and eventually we could reach 85% without mandates.

Even after pronouncing Covid no big deal, bragging that he got and shortly ended up feeling ""great"" he did get the vaccine.  Why hasn't he hawked his followers to get it?  It would have made him a hero!  He remains mum, why I will never understand.  How can a great nation have so many foolish people?"

Now doubt about it.   More vaccinations means more cases more deaths.   Right?      

Even if partially effective against the nefarious and conveniently found Variant D.  More vaccinations should lower things, shouldn't it?    

The key point to me is this disease is wipped.   It is down to basic noise level.  No mass shaming or major controls would even be thought of if this is all it was."

If they have to sell their home, ATVs, RVs, and boats to pay for the hospital visit, they’d have incentive to get the shots.   

Deny companies, States, Counties and Cities federal funds or insurance expense tax write-offs if they don’t mandate the vaccine for employees.

The unvaccinated are eroding the right to life,  and that cannot be acceptable under any circumstances, especially when vaccination refusal has become the hallmark of a party dedicated to imposing minority rule via a combination of voter suppression and open collaboration with foreign powers seeking to subvert America by sustained Narrative Warfare. 

Perhaps this will push Democrats to realizing that the only way they can escape subordination to minority rule via moving the goalposts may be to plan a massive ""Bluexit"", in the name of their right to life. If this happens, Republican led vaccination resistance could be the best thing that could happen to this country. Blue rump America, which has about two thirds of the country's population, and 80% of its GDP, would remain a major power. The CSA 2.0 however, would face a very different fate.

2021-07-26 01:37:59,"Public health officials, politicians, health care workers and the media are missing the big covid story.

They cannot change people or their minds. 

The only thing that will cause more people to seek vaccinations is a sharp increase in infections, hospitalizations and covid and flu deaths.

Until the ""immortal"" unvaccinated  are scared to death, they will deny the need for vaccines.  And they will refuse them.

Already, in the last week, as the Times reported Sunday, a surge in vaccinations has begun only a week or to since deaths caused by the Delta variant began to surge.

It makes little sense to depend on politicians and public health officials to do the impossible—change life-long behaviors, including refusing vaccines.

Politicians, of course, believe they have to be seen as ""doing something"", and they'll continue to grandstand to no effect.

This means that we vaccinated elderly and other vulnerable folks have to resume our pretty isolated lives. 

From the beginning of the pandemic, it has been clear that we'll be isolating ourselves for the rest of our lives because the pandemic will never end even with enough vaccine supplies to treat everyone in the world.

So the focus should be on educating vaccinated people about how to avoid and even ostracize the unvaccinated and about how and when to get booster shots."

The Republican Party has been called a driver of vaccine-resistance. Perhaps that's a chicken-and-egg analysis -- given the nature of Trump and his supporters, perhaps the GOP merely exemplifies the root-cause of both ""Trumpism"" and vaccine-resistance:  responsibility-resistance. Trump never considers the well-being of anyone but himself, and never takes responsibility for his bad behavior; that's his attraction to half a nation of spoiled brats in a nutshell."

Lets also pray we're not in the thirty percent who have long COVID even after full vaccination.  Be well everyone."

2021-07-26 07:58:07,"The general consensus in the EU seems to be that Covid and Delta are most lethal for 40+. And the assumption is that children if they get covid or delta have only mild symptoms, and they didn't close the schools here through 15 years old. And school will start this fall with little worry. And there is no vaccine for children under 12 years old until 2022. I recently moved to an EU country for my husband's work. The nightly news and talks shows barely talking about vaccinations. I am my husband are middle aged and vaccinated. His ex-wife is middle aged and vaccinated. He has 2 adult children from his 1st marriage who are 27 and 33. Neither of the young adults  or any of their friends have been vaccinated is what they tell us. Neither of their parents seem to care that they are not vaccinated. The USA seems almost hysterical about vaccinating young people when the general agreement world wide seems to be that mostly old people die from covid or delta. Anyway, I am for vaccinations. Just commenting on the slightly differently atmosphere in the EU towards young people needing vaccinations. Vaccines seem to be for 40+ here."
2021-07-26 13:37:07,"I’m really tired of the term vaccine hesitant and the talk among the unvaccinated that they just can’t decide if the vaccine is safe. Millions upon millions have received the vaccine. Any unwanted complications are extremely rare. The I’m not sure excuse is becoming ridiculous. I think the bigger problem is a year plus of a psychotic POTUS minimizing the risk of the virus and his right wing enablers on right wing talk radio and TV spreading lies and misinformation. Some of them still are daily. There is a large segment of the society that are indoctrinated and are now so anti government and science that they can no longer think clearly, if they ever could. The anti vaccine crowd that was small but has always been around has gotten new fuel from all of this too. Supposedly there are 12 major spreaders of lies and misinformation on social media. Robert F Kennedy is one of them. Ban them all. Biden also needs to do what France did. Crack down and impose mandates. Enough with trying to persuade these defiant people. Consequences for refusing vaccination is needed. We’ve tried all else with little success. There will be pushback but at this point who cares?"
2021-07-26 13:54:57,"I was in Cambodia when the pandemic struck, and where vaccines were scarce (with long lines of people trying to get a lucky few vaccines) when they finally arrived, came into the US and got my shots immediately. I have a plan for how to overcome or at least reduce the threat of the vaccine resisters, which I have published on my blog, which very few people read. I hope someone hears of it and takes action: a combination of incentives and disincentives based on a shrewd analysis of the psychology of the resisters.

2021-07-26 19:00:25,"Where I live, I believe the ratio of homeless to those with homes is almost 50/50. It's really crucial for herd immunity for everyone to be vaccinated.  We also don't know, for those who are vaccinated, how long the vaccine is effective, making it even more imperative to reach those who are having a hard time, or downright refusing.  It seems to me people, particularly the wealthy and the red, are getting away with abusing, ""The land of the Free and the Home of the Brave,"" i.e. the rights of the individual, over that of the greater good, for too long; in too many areas. 

For people who want the vaccine and are unable, shame on the rest of us; for people who can and won't, shame on them.

Though not recognized as sentient, viruses behave as if they are, shifting their structures to invade and destroy whatever host they live off of.  It's difficult enough for science to keep up with these shifts.  And we all were, are, and will be the live lab rats who are used to get this virus under control.  

I venture to say that viruses are much more intelligent in their maneuvers of survival than their human counterparts....  

I would so like it if we could be a society thinking of others instead of the selfishness (and ignorance) that has pervaded and been promoted by those who should know better.

...Were a wider swath of the population vaccinated, there would be no resurgence — of the Delta variant, or Alpha variant, or any other version of the coronavirus...

The Delta variant has been a problem in countries with higher vaccination rates, and it's impossible to say that no other variant would/could spread. Sure, if 80% of the US population were vaccinated, consistently across all states, then perhaps no big spike to speak of. But that was never realistic. Vaccine hesitancy is a huge problem, but the virus might've found a way, esp given that data about vaccine effectiveness against the variants is mixed. It's misleading to imply that we could have stopped the virus and its variants completely if we'd simply decided, collectively, that we felt like it."

 Healthcare workers at the front lines cannot and will not take much more from the unvaccinated population.  Many have quit or will quit after Delta blazes through.  I do not blame them.

Unbelievably a percentage of healthcare workers still refuse the vaccinations.  Many will die.  Firing them if they refuse the vaccination will cause even more dire staff shortages.

It would be useful to  study the following premise: are semi-effective vaccines in fact engines of variant creation?

As a part of this global discussion, why is there no mention of all the other measures people should be taking to protect themselves?  Proper rest, good nutrition, getting in shape (as obesity has been shown to be a driver of COVID severity), proper vitamins (there are various papers online referring to the efficacy of vitamin D in particular in reducing likelihood and severity, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the American population).  Thank goodness for Bill Maher; he's the only individual I've seen in the ""popular"" media who has properly addressed these important steps.   It's time for the mainstream media to stop with the Medical Pharmaceutical Political Industrial bias (with money as its primary driver), and start looking at this problem from all the angles.

In 1947, there was a smallpox outbreak in NY. In a bit more than a month, 6,350,000 people were vaccinated against smallpox. There was little to no talk about 'my freedoms'. The smallpox outbreak was stalled and only 12 people actually contracted smallpox. This was the last major outbreak of smallpox in the US.

It was routine for babies of my generation to be vaxxed against smallpox. We all have the scars. Smallpox no longer exists in the wild. There was never any question about getting a smallpox vaccination, or later on, the polio vax. Neither of those two diseases exist in the US.

The unvaccinated for Covid are disease vectors who allow for the rise and spread of the variants. They are a danger to children who are currently too young to be vaxxed and those who are immuno-compromised, such as people going through chemo, taking immunosuppressants or who have diseases of the immune system, like lupus or RA.

2021-07-23 15:41:11,"The Olympics are wrapped up in corruption and seedy real estate deals, but they're great. I'm sorry, but I find the subtle disdain that the editorial voice at the Times seems to have toward them is strange, and the calls for getting rid of them altogether is also very odd. Whatever happened to taking pride in each others nations best athletes? Everyone is so cynical."
2021-07-23 15:50:36,"I thought the whole production was pretty bad.

It took 2½ hours for the athletes to saunter in. Then the IOC president was allowed to drone for more than 10 minutes in a speech of meaningless motherhood statements, spending 2 full minutes on the English explanation of the word ""solidarity"". It was almost midnight and they were still having cryptic Japanese comedic sketches. By the time Naomi Osaka took over the torch, her eyes were literally drooping.

I am not aware that Japanese audiences have super patience for such boring rituals. Can't imagine Michael Jordan or Michael Phelps taking part."
2021-07-23 15:55:12,"I have been following a couple of Olympic athletes on Instagram over the past year. They have been recounting their preparation for the games, and have shown their training and the competitions they've been in to qualify. In spite of the circumstances, these games still mean a lot to the athletes. They don't mind the empty stadiums. In fact, one diver said the other day that they've been training and competing over the past year with no audiences, and it would probably be jarring to suddenly be faced with a venue full of noise. I think we should remember who these games are for. Yes, there's a financial and political element with them, but the athletes have been preparing for years for this opportunity to test themselves against the best competition in the world. It's not about spectators, or the organizers or politics. If you're an athlete, it's about pure love of your sport and a desire to prove yourself. Most of them and their families have sacrificed a lot for a long time to be there. And while some of the better known athletes do have endorsements and sponsors, most are not. Most won't make much money at all, even if they win a medal. That's not why they do it. It's hard for people to accept that in today's world where money means everything. I'm excited to watch the games and will be cheering here at home for my favorites. I don't care about any of the rest of it."
2021-07-23 15:57:33,"am i the only one who acknowledges that japan is trying to protect its citizens, all of the athletes and their relatives, and the local citizens and (international) public fans from the spread of the coronavirus variants?  it's tragic enough that the event was wisely postponed a year, but it makes no sense to postpone it yet another year which would coincide with the Winter Olympics in 2022.

seems sad, but necessary to me that the games must go on and be done with this year.  is it not also for the elite athletes whose training had to extend a year under such dire covid lockdown circumstances globally?  for some, this may be their first or last chance to participate as an Olympic Athlete, it is a lifetime achievement."
2021-07-23 16:01:00,"While I appreciate young athletes at that top of their sport competing to represent their respective countries.  I also feel that the Olympics are no longer viable.  The corruption, the cheating, the drugs, the politics and the cost.  And the timing of events on TV, and keeping up with it to watch makes following any one sport nearly impossible.  I don’t watch anymore and don’t think it’s worth having them."
2021-07-23 16:12:11,It only seems like yesterday we were watching the jam packed crowds at the London Olympics opening ceremony produced by Danny Boyle romanticizing the industrial revolution with soot covered dancing chimney sweeps and belching smokestacks.  Good luck with that theme these days.
2021-07-23 16:18:21,"The Olympics is an athletic competition, not a circus.  The audience is the world, via video broadcast.  The athletes understand perfectly well that the entire world is cheering for them.  Just a screen away.  

It's not what they imagined, but it is a valid Olympics that can be presented well to the world.  Best spirits to Tokyo and the Olympians."
2021-07-23 16:04:02,"I thought it was moving not ""somber"" and teared up when it started.  No need to for NYT to drone on about empty stands.  We know that already.  The athletes all looked thrilled - maybe even more so than usual given what has happened over the past year.  Also, at this point, they are accustomed to no spectators.   Their athletic experiences and accomplishments over the next 2 weeks should be the focus of your coverage."
2021-07-23 16:04:26,This is the most sensible way to do it!
2021-07-23 16:16:38,"Another lesson that humans are expendable for profit. Our top athletes are being put in harms way for a mere 4.1 percent of the IOC profits. Corporation sponsored greed has made an ancient historical event showcasing the world’s top athletes ugly, reckless and dangerous."
2021-07-23 16:17:18,"No these great athletes are not waving at empty seats. They are waving at the world, at me and you. They are pressing on to display the most astounding assemblage of athletic prowess the world has ever seen. 

Even a pandemic cannot signal the end of human achievement."
2021-07-23 16:29:35,"The world is burning and drowning. Starvation and child poverty is rampant. Democracies are crumbling. 
Let's watch what billions of dollars are spent on...oh some Japanese dancing...so nice."
2021-07-23 16:33:05,"To encourage people around the world to get vaccinated maybe in addition to the shotput competition they should have a shotget competition, where the nation with the highest percentage of its population vaccinated by the end of the Games gets a gold medal."
2021-07-23 16:35:24,That drone globe was phenomenal. Loved Imagine. But I love anything Lennon. PBS says huge protests outside. I would hope this isn’t proceeding against majority of Japanese will. They say NBC to make huge bucks.
2021-07-23 16:36:14,Time to rethink this event. The IOC is a corrupted authoritarian organization with a few people making lots of money while countries eat it building useless infrastructure. A very expensive sport festival for rich kids while people are getting sick and dying and the world is burning: that tells you everything you need to know about the IOC.
2021-07-23 16:45:00,"I lost interest decades ago, but Skateboarding? I'm a fan of Bocce Ball. How about a cohort of elderly folks competing for the ""Gold"" in Bocce? Predictions: 


Brisket or Ribs BBQ as an Olympic sport can't be far away.


And, the greatest American sport of all: Competition Capital Expenditure. Couples could be given $5 million and then draw lots to buy houses in the hottest housing markets. Bonus points if you pay  $1 million over the asking price"

2021-07-23 16:54:45,These photos look so dark; as if the whole ceremony took part underground. Not very uplifting.
2021-07-23 17:00:41,I’ve been watching ladies softball…It’s great…Why be so negative?
2021-07-23 16:59:29,"The problem is, these ""Olympic Games"" have absolutely NOTHING in common with the real Olympic Games, see:

""During the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns."" W.

And - actually, have EVERYTHING in common with this:

""Bread and circuses' -  or bread and games, is a metonymic phrase referring to superficial appeasement. It is attributed to Juvenal, a Roman poet active in the late first and early second century CE — and is used commonly in cultural, particularly political, contexts. In a political context, the phrase means to generate public approval, not by excellence in public service or public policy, but by diversion, distraction or by satisfying the most immediate or base requirements of a populace — by offering a palliative: for example food (bread) or entertainment (circuses). Juvenal, who originated the phrase, used it to decry the 'selfishness' of common people and their neglect of wider concerns. The phrase implies a population's erosion or ignorance of civic duty as a priority."" W."
2021-07-23 17:05:17,"This is, to repeat what's been said, money wasted. I'll feel bad for the Greco-Roman wrestlers and archers, but swimmers, gymnasts, and track and field athletes around the world already compete against each other all the time. An Olympic medal is just a means to make more money."
2021-07-23 17:35:33,Boston applied for the 2024 Olympics and fortunately We the People put a stop to it. Leading the push for approval was a big construction company. We the People knew what it would really cost the City. The Olympics should be in the same City every four Years.  Athens for the Summer Games and Switzerland for the Winter Games.
2021-07-23 17:50:25,"The Opening Ceremony: well, that was odd."
2021-07-23 18:07:34,"The Olympics are a welcome respite from the last eighteen months! However, NBC's television coverage is disgraceful! Not only do we get commercials every five minutes, but now they do a split screen with the intrusive commercials! To make matters worse, with delayed coverage of soccer matches, they now have the audacity to inhibit the usual 45 minutes of non stop soccer action with a pause in coverage by inserting commercials during the halves! Shame on NBC!"
2021-07-23 18:17:35,"Global games during a global pandemic?

So irresponsible. 

Will not watch."
2021-07-23 18:04:03,"From The Daily Beast:
""At tonight’s opener, the organizers used the music of Koichi Sugiyama, a notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist Japanese composer—despite warnings that it might go over very badly.... He’s denied the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese troops in the late 1930s. He has stated that the Korean women who were working as sexual slaves to the Japanese empire were actually happy-go-lucky prostitutes.""
I wish the athletes well but, to quote Bob Dylan. ""it's a political world"" and these tone deaf (to say the least) games are a blight on all of them."
2021-07-23 18:55:48,"I am so glad I read this gloomy depiction of the games, AFTER watching the moving opening ceremony for myself. Clearly, the athletes who've trained for the last five years are thrilled to be competing. I doubt they're concerned about a lack of dignitaries in the stands! I truly feel for the Japanese people. But isn't agreeing to host the games like a marriage vow? ""I promise to be be good to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health."""
2021-07-23 19:21:03,"I'm sure I'm showing my age but, the Olympics have become nothing more than a tool for NBC to make money.   And the IOC makes money.  And some athletes in popular sports make money.  But they've added so many quasi-sports - next it will be hopscotch.    And I suspect NBC drove the Japanese government and IOC to get these Games going - more money in NBC's pocket.  And if NBC shows one more ""up close and personal"" feature on an athlete I never heard of, instead of showing actual competitions, they should be banned from airing these Games ever again."
2021-07-23 20:10:50,"If this event was in England or the USA the stadium would be near full. 
The IOC earns 4 billion in TV rights.
The pandemic has already restructured how a games city bids, gets selected and how much public money is spent.
Me I don't need screaming fans to appreciate the efforts of top sports people.
Skateboarders didn't rebell, they joined in."
2021-07-23 21:42:48,"An empty, vacant event: a perfect symbol of the IOC and the Olympic ""Movement."" Though more perfect would have been if the stadium had been filled with piles and piles of cash."
2021-07-23 22:00:07,"Empty seats and unwatched television broadcasts.  I and most of my friends will not watched the ""Olympics that should not have been."""
2021-07-23 19:24:21,"I loved this, this is for the athletes, I feel for them."
2021-07-23 18:49:32,"I was 14 in 1964 and living with my family  on a U.S air base (Tachikawa), a short train ride to Tokyo. Those Olympics were held in mid-October (wise choice), and I was lucky enough to see a few events: Billy Mills winning the 10K, and Don Schollander winning 100m freestyle in the architecturally impressive Yoyogi National Gymnasium complex. The feeling of pride that overtook the country permeated everything. To this day, because of the overwhelming experience the Japanese people gave to the world (the first world-wide televised Olympiad) — and to this then-youngster — every four years I clear my schedule to watch each and every Summer and Winter Olympics. I wish the brave, generous and persistent Japanese people Godspeed for an Olympic Games as successful as possible, under the circumstances. “Domo Arigato!” sincerely from the bottom of my heart."
2021-07-23 21:18:21,"I was so disappointed that JOC chose Naomi Osaka (a competing athlete in this Olympics) to lit the Olympic cauldron. They should have given this honor to Japan's Judo great - Ryoko Tani, who competed in five Olympics, and won 2 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze medals. It's simply politics!"
2021-07-23 20:36:13,"The Olympics is now too big, has too many niche competitions (3x3 basketball, artistic swimming, futsol, etc.) , is too bureaucratic, and is controlled by money and power hungry people who care little for sports. Many top athletes opt out because it is so corrupted and rigidly controlled by the power and money interests, to the neglect of sports.
Even without COVID interest has plummeted, probably for good with major reforms.
This is the ""who cares Olympics""."
2021-07-23 20:34:06,"Is there a movement to reduce the importance of ""Sports"" in our mass culture?  I wish there were, especially on the front page.  But it does fit so well with other aspects of mass capitalism and consumption.  And in this spirit, it does promote a basic premise of ""corporate""  capitalism:  cooperation (ah let's say teamwork) exists so that the competition (ah let's say opponent or perhaps enemy) may be defeated.  Or maybe the idea is more individualistic like the hero CEO shooting off to the moon with all the virtue and rocket ship he can muster.  Now the ancient Maya did play kick ball with the human heads of their defeated enemies.  And gladiators were definitely after blood.  But why now after the long history of war and beating do we want to practice and celebrate its imitation?   There are no heroes.  The legends were a lie."
2021-07-23 18:04:11,"The headline ""Tokyo Olympics Open to a Sea of Empty Seats"" is a classic example of the negativity bias of modern news media. Almost the entire audience for any Olympics is on TV and empty seats are just a blip. This is a very positive international event showing great success in difficulty circumstances, and your reporters are having to work extra hard to find the most negative possible spin."
2021-07-23 20:00:08,"So much hate and cynicism in these comments. People really need to learn to unwind. Just because the world has problems and the IOC is a heavily flawed organization doesn’t mean the Olympics are some great evil worthy of such vitriolic opposition. There’s still the amazement of seeing the greatest athletes in the world, the pride of seeing your nation claim victory, the beauty of international fraternity and friendly competition. 

Not everything has to be grey and gloom all the time. If we’re going to improve ourselves, we need some optimism and excitement, and that’s what sport provides."
2021-07-23 22:14:59,It’s outright negligent and cruel for any American Olympic Athlete to show up in Japan unvaccinated. How can Japan allow athletes to show up unvaccinated? Japan should demand shut down for this alone.
2021-07-23 18:54:20,"This article could have been written for a funeral, not the Olympics. How about a few words about how the Games could provide a source of distraction and decompression for a world badly in need of it? Think Euro soccer, NBA, NFL Super Bowl and other successes and try to project positivity on the Olympics. Why a recital of all this negativity?"
2021-07-23 20:45:01,"I haven't taped any Opening Ceremonies since 2012 London. There are still good stories but basically the whole enterprise don't do any favors to the locals, is just a P.R. tool for the host countries, and many athletes who pursue the ""dream"" at all cost including unaware they are being abused is just messed up. The Olympic is not as ""clean"" as they are sold."
2021-07-23 19:01:31,PBS reported that a female athlete had to withdraw because they made breastfeeding difficult. It’s 2021. Not 1921. For Gods Sake Olympics get a grip. These athletes do have babies. Deal with it.
2021-07-23 23:59:53,"Games are boring this year and just do not feel right. 

Usually I know a lot of my friends that normally watch. We would usually get together. About a couple of dozen folks. This year? Two, maybe three on a good day will watch. and alone, by themselves.

People just do not seem that interested in the Olympics this time around. They do not feel as important as they once did. 

Sort of like people no longer watching the Academy Awards anymore. Did you watch the Oscars this time around? 
I thought not. We neither."
2021-07-24 00:11:14,"They should have put it off another year.  I'm reluctant to even watch because I know well-qualified athlete are being disqualified because they test positive, and not having fans in the seats is a big downer for everyone.  While it's certainly hard for athletes to keep in top condition for an extra year, it's much harder to accept that they can't compete at all through no fault of their own.  The olympics should primarily accommodate the athletes.  I don't understand why they didn't delay it."
2021-07-24 01:13:51,"In this and other articles in this paper I keep reading that most Japanese “don’t want the Olympics held.”  This sounds like most Japanese don’t want them held at all. However, polls consistently show only thirty percent feel so. Another good thirty want to postpone them for a bit more until vaccination rates rise. Other segments have no opinion. I think this distinction should be made."
2021-07-23 23:02:46,"All the people in the west ""welcoming"" the Olympics as a ""respite"" and complaining about negativity is selfish and disgusting.

80% of the Japanese public was against holding the Olympics. Throughout the whole opening ceremony there were multiple different activist groups protesting against it, that were being manhandled by the police.

The NHK narration talked about the suffering of athletes throughout the pandemic, ignoring how athletes got to have their precious Olympics while everyone else suffered for worse and still does.

They went on about refugees after deporting the Ugandan athlete who wanted asylum but wasn't even allowed to apply for it.

They talked about diversity even though they fired Latyr Sy from the ceremony because, I quote, ""it makes no sense to have an African here"".

The Tokyo Olympics are nothing more than a cash-grab scheme by the affluent elite to further make money off of the common people's suffering, and celebrating it is nothing short of blatant imperialism."
2021-07-24 00:20:23,"Disparage the Olympics all you want. There's plenty that's wrong. 

But the athletes in most cases are remarkable, from sports I understand like gymnastics and basketball and swimming to sports I do not like synchronized swimming and taekwondo.

Japan valiantly tried to put on these games, twice! To the tune of billions of dollars in the middle of pandemic it had nothing to do with.

It will take China decades, if not centuries, to right the wrong of unleashing Covid 2 on the world so soon after Covid 1, SARS. What a clueless country. 

I will watch the games to honor the athletes."
2021-07-24 01:45:47,"I am not watching.  I am not watching what could be a 'super-spreader event.  The news reports that 100+ US  athletes have not been vaccinated - now what does that say about priorities?
Nor do I watch any tape-delayed games. 
Remember when the Olympic ""Committee"" was going to remove Wrestling as an Olympic sport.  Terrible.
But rest assured we have rhythmic dancing and synchronized swimming.  Yeah remember playing that in the old school yard.  I would like to see the Javelin scored not only on distance, but proximity to a target - just like in the days of yore when the target was the enemy - sorry snowflakes ! .

It is not a sport if the scoring is not measurable.  It is not a sport if the score is on the eye of the beholder.

I am not watching this commercial event."
2021-07-24 02:06:32,"It's  so  hard. During a pandemic, an Olympics! I live in New York City and have heart  disease and diabetes. COVID-19  was looking for me. I'm in the theatre so we were first close, and will be last to open because we can't sustain the  responsibility to have audiences put at risk. Same here, though larger (literally). I mention all of this because the last 18-months have changed everything; things I never thought possible occurred. And things I relied on; vanished. My microcosm is the macrocosm of  thousands of  athletes, mangers, coaches, organizers  and health  professionals to stop a disaster in the making. May  it all  work out. May Olympic  freedom  reign  and may they find the love I never thought I'd have -- but did find, because of this global difficulty. Sometimes in drama if the hero sustains injury, but still makes it back home, the victory is somehow sweeter. I just want everyone to be safe and am saddened by those working years to be cut at the knees by this pernicious virus. Let the games proceed  peacefully with creativity, and one day include knife throwing—the fastest growing sport on Earth. If skateboarding, then why not?"

2021-07-23 23:53:33,"I am sorry for the people in Japan, literally forced to host this in the midst of pandemic and under the state of emergency, where the local experts express concern on the real possibility of medical system collapse unless they can tame the current wave of Covid-19 in time.

Yes, daily infection/death rates in Japan are far lower than those in the west, but since when the life of one person has been worth less than the lives of multiple?
 
And their vaccination scheme hasn't been as fast as that of US, with only 22% or so fully vaccinated. A lot of adults there still have no idea on when they can get the first jab. If we were in their boat, would we host the Games, meaning almost 100,000 people coming here from all over the world which is very far from 'overcoming' this pandemic? Already there are reports that some visitors roam around the streets in Tokyo which only increase the anxiety of its citizens due to a gaping hole in their gov't's safety measures.

Many commentators tell about these Games deserve more uplifting coverage, but I am not sure if they could step into their shoes. And what about our athletes & their staffs exposed to the danger of infection every day during this event? Haven't you heard of Long Covid at all?

On the top of that, JOC didn't bother vetting people involved in the event and ended up having persons who assaulted schools classmates w/ disabilities, having made fun of Holocaust, and denied Japan's war time atrocities. 

We can be more mindful."
2021-07-23 22:00:01,"Should have been canceled, or at least postponed until next year; a lot of Japanese think so."
2021-07-24 01:50:45,"I wish the players a safe, healthy Games, and hope they'll do the right thing and play clean.  I'm not sure they should be held even now what with Covid still a problem, but I understand why players would compete even under that horrible cloud.  For better or worse, human determination and ambition is indomitable.

Catching a bit of the (evening rebroadcast of) the opening did yield some treats for the ear, if like me your idea of a cute handheld accessory is a controller: I'm quite sure I heard the theme of Star Light Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog as Oman entered, Robo's Theme from fellow Japan-made video game Chrono Trigger before that, and Frog's Theme from that game as Senegal entered.  I didn't know about Koichi Sugiyama's horribleness[1] before now, but the organizers can almost be forgiven: I'm no Dragon Quest player, but that game series he's composed for is MASSIVE in Japan, even more so than Final Fantasy.[2]

1. US athletes chanting ""U.S.A."" as if they were attending a local Trump rally.

2. Singing Imagine with the line ""imagine there's no countries"" immediately after the athletes marched into the stadium strictly divided by country."
2021-07-24 04:45:02,It wouldn’t have been unreasonable to require all athletes and support team members to be vaccinated in order to attend. I don’t understand how you could let these people congregate so closely for 2 weeks without requiring vaccinations. It seems reckless and foolhardy.

The commission for the design of the stadium was subsequently awarded to Kengo Kuma, a male Japanese architect.

Zaha Hadid, a female and a non-Japanese no less, attributed this to Japanese nationalism, as was reported here in the NYT, “Ms. Hadid, who has staunchly defended her design against her critics in interviews and on her website, immediately protested the decision in a statement and suggested that nationalist motives lay behind the rejection of her plan” (Tokyo Olympic Stadium Quarrel Grows, Feb 3, 2016).

She also accused Japan’s establishment of xenophobia and chauvinism according to The New York Times, “Last year, Ms. Hadid accused her critics in Japan’s architectural establishment of chauvinism, telling Dezeen, a design magazine, that they “don’t want a foreigner to build in Tokyo for a national stadium.”” (Japan Selects New Plan for 2020 Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Dec 22, 2015)."

After all the color, flair and imagination of other nations' clothes, we march in  almost monochromatic in blue jeans, blue blazers and blue and white horizontally (!) striped shirts. What a bore. What an embarrassment. We have the greatest designers in the world and that's what we come up with? I know there are more serious issues involved with these games but, really, it's mortifying."
2021-07-24 08:22:24,"What is the point - other than financial gain for some  individuals and corporations -- of having these (spectator-less) Games during the pandemic? And, more generally, why hold such huge sports events (e.g. 2022 World-Cup soccer in Qatar) in unsuitable climates?"

Watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics, many Japanese including children without masks participated in that event which continued near midnight. People would not accept what the governor demanded. People think why they have to cancel their pleasures when parties concerned in the Olympics are enjoying the event and games. The pandemic and the Olympics have brought chaos in Tokyo. Japanese have learned that it’s not so difficult to invite the Olympics but it’s impossible to cancel them."

Gymnastics? Just watch a squirrel or a cat, there is nothing agile or acrobatic about humans.

Compared to all other mammals, from sloths to spider monkeys, we are stiff, slow, glued to the ground, lumbering, inflexible, weak mannequins.

We lost all our physical prowess, sacrificed for the large brain, which we grew in order to outsmart & kill all the other incredible animals.

This is what humans excel at, not sport nor physical prowess, we kill, and we don't even do that gracefully.

Our closest cousins, the Chimps, are so vastly stronger, more flexible, powerful, poised, balanced, virtually every move they make is stupendously more amazing than the most perfect gymnast we have.

Competition? Agony of defeat? Please. We have enough of agony. We are all facing defeat at the hands of our arrogance & exploitation.

If people want some world exercise, go back to taking World's Fairs seriously. Or something.

Everything about the Olympics is wrong."
2021-07-24 08:58:38,It’s all about the money in the end.
2021-07-24 09:03:37,"On the bright side, it is nice to see Asia leading us out of the pandemic too by hosting the Olympics. All the best to the athletes!"
2021-07-24 12:30:09,"The only reason the Tokyo Games are being held is becaue the Japanese government is under contract to the IOC, and all the IOC is interested in is the massive revenues from international TV."
2021-07-24 05:32:03,"I really dislike professional sports (not the actual sports, just the athletes, the money, the politics, the egos...ick), but I love the Olympics! At least up until this year.....

I love to see inspiring athletes who love their sport, and strive to be the best. I love it when athletes from poor countries win. I love to marvel at how much training and discipline it takes to get there. I love that the vast majority aren't seeking fame or fortune. 

Covid had already dampened my enthusiasm this year, but the myopic soccer protests were the last straw. There are too many atrocities in the world, not to mention the usual 800 million starving and 2 billion (WHO's #) without clean drinking water. And yet, Americans are the ones protesting...on behalf of other Americans. I support their cause, but this is the wrong time, and wrong audience. 80% of the world's population has a standard of living below that of an American living under our poverty line. Can it ever *not* be about America?"
2021-07-24 11:50:07,"There isn’t any question that this Olympics should not be held given the pandemic. Are American athletes who are not vaccinated the example we need to convey to the rest of the world? And, are the Japanese people so hard up for athletic recognition that they chose Naomi Osaka to light the torch to “celebrate” her hypocritical emergence from her bout of depression to return to the country she “represents”, having revoked the citizenship of the United States, where she really lives, while continuing to pocket millions worldwide as she pleads for our empathy for refusing to take a few meaningless interviews?"
2021-07-24 05:10:50,"It's hard to fathom how utterly pathetic the Japanese government handled the COVID crisis and these Olympic Games.  While other developed countries have stadiums full of fans (and even in Japan baseball games are allowed with reduced attendance), we see an enormous stadium EMPTY while athletes march in.  It's one of the most depressing spectacles ever in the history of these games, and although a portion of the blame lies in the unfortunate state that the world in general has been in since the COVID plague struck, I simply cannot imagine any government handling the current situation worse than the Japanese government has handled this Olympics.  Meant to showcase the world's third largest economy in a positive light, the current Olympics are instead highlighting a country in undeniable decline.  Very very sad to witness."
2021-07-24 13:10:33,"Olympics should be held in existing stadiums + housing with only few needed additions.
They are still valid - but the bidding + building process has completely gotten out of hand, drowning out international sports and a world-wide armistice. Those were the original aims.
It could be healthy to shrink the games back to those."
2021-07-24 13:45:24,"One more glaring example of the land of make-believe that the IOC lives in. A rational decision by the IOC would have been to postpone the Tokyo games until 2022 and then reset the schedule with Paris in 2026 and Los Angeles in 2028. Recall, it was not that long ago that the IOC shifted with Winter Games by two years. It can be done again. Another rational decision would have been to require COVID vaccinations for all athletes & support staff attending the Olympics. The US Olympic Committee should be embarrassed to sent 100 un-vaccinated athletes to Tokyo."
2021-07-22 17:08:49,"Although we never got tested, i'm pretty sure my family just had a breakthrough infection.  Symptoms were a really bad cold plus some loss of taste and smell.

Personally I'd rather get that again then have to wear a mask."
2021-07-22 17:10:33,"We have been told for months that once completely vaccinated, masks were no longer needed in most cases. I went on an airplane trip two weeks ago, fully masked except for meals. Now the government is considering flipping on that. How can we trust anything going forward. I am scheduling a covid test to make sure I did not pick anything up."
2021-07-22 17:11:48,"Data from across the country, clearly show that if you're vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine you live; if not you're playing Russian roulette. In the United States, at least 99% of COVID-19 deaths and 97% of hospitalizations are among people who have not been vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's nothing the vaccinated need to learn to live with.  Life is back to normal. And it's in First World countries' interest to vaccinate the world to keep variants at bay that MAY one day break through the current vaccines."
2021-07-22 17:12:47,"It's time for vaccinations to be made mandatory. We do it for schools, we can do it for any other public space."

Did you have no reaction to the vaccine? Strong reaction to the vaccine? Date of your vaccination? Your age? Etc. This is the kind of information that news reporting is leaving out."
2021-07-22 17:15:39,"We need to understand that ""mild"" symptoms means you don't end up in the hospital. I was fully vaccinated in March, but about two weeks ago I suddenly got the worst, horrific wracking bone dry cough. I could barely get an inhalation in edgewise. My head hurt, my eyeballs hurt, my neck hurt. I barely had the energy to get off the couch to go to the bathroom and I didn't eat for 36 hours. Even then food tasted weird and disgusting for a couple of days. It took me at least a full week to get my strength and stamina back. So that's ""mild"" symptoms. You don't want that."
2021-07-22 17:17:11,I have a fully vaccinated relative and a partially vaccinated relative who were both infected by a partially vaccinated relative who was infected by an unvaccinated coworker. All had mild (not hospitalized) symptoms. But still.
2021-07-22 17:17:53,"This is a naive article, offering anecdotal comments from individuals who seem to have some association with institutions. But there is no mention of the latest information coming from virologists with nationally recognized  expertise or epidemiologists with decades of major epidemic experience. I'd suggest looking for far better quality and more up-to-date knowledge. It can be found easily by accessing This Week in Virology via this link:  <a href=""https://www.microbe.tv/twiv"" target=""_blank"">https://www.microbe.tv/twiv</a>.
It's world-authority scientists speaking with each other in plain language, readily understood and filled with practical information."
2021-07-22 17:17:57,"I heard that their has also been an outbreak in Fire Island Pines.  Is that right?

As Dana Bash noted last night on CNN, not all the breakthrough infections are “mild.” My MD told me that two of his patients, fully vaccinated, had tested positives, and that both ran fevers of 103-105 degrees, for several days. So did two patients of one of his colleagues, he said, and all 4 had been healthy - no chronic illnesses - before getting sick.

Sure, only 3 percent of the hospitalizations are vaccinated people.  Delta has not reached all  areas of the US, and it takes a couple of weeks before people land in the hospital.  What I want to know: what percentage of vaccinated people are testing positive (Israel says the efficacy rate of the Pfizer vaccine against Delta is only 67%), and what percentage of those vaccinated who test positive are hospitalized?  The overall hospitalization rate does not give me this information."
2021-07-22 17:19:26,"The vaccines are incredibly effective....much better at reducing illness than most other vaccines we take for granted. As a society, we need to reset expectations. The covid vaccines do not provide ""sterling immunity"" with 100 % protection. We need to learn to live with the covid virus for decades, (maybe forever). Since COVID-19 is never going away, the pandemic won’t end ""when covid is gone"". 
It will end when we stop thinking about it all the time, because we’ve made its risk commensurate with other every-day risks. Cable news will resist this, the media wants you to think about it all the time because it is good for the media business."
2021-07-22 17:20:43,"“Still, vaccinated people can come down with infections, overwhelmingly asymptomatic to mild. That may come as a surprise to vaccinated Americans, who often assume that they are completely shielded from the virus.”

America has failed as a nation.  This information is fundamental to how vaccines work and we’ve just accepted that most Americans are surprised by this.  We should have spent millions if not billions of dollars educating the public about the virus and the vaccines.  Instead we’ve left that job to Facebook and cnn and Fox News.  A government in the pocket of billionaires will hand all power to billionaires.  Including the power to educate the public.  But billionaires do not have our best interest in mind.  They have their profits and shareholders in mind.  We must end this unfettered capitalist madness that is destroying our country."
2021-07-22 17:20:51,"The mask guidance here in California is really confusing. We are advised to wear masks indoors, but businesses are open and operating normally. So we can enter a restaurant wearing a mask (or not), and remove the mask (if we are wearing one) when we sit down at a table and start eating and drinking. Servers and other restaurant staff are masked. This protects the employees, which is of primary importance, since they are in contact with the public for their full shifts. But this mask on/mask off behavior of indoor diners is just theatrics. 

I (fully vaccinated) am dealing with this mess by limiting my trips out overall. I’d wear a mask in grocery and home supply stores (the only indoor places I shop these days). When I dine out, I eat outside wherever that is possible. In fact, I live most of my life outdoors now. Even at home."
2021-07-22 17:21:25,"If I were to get a breakthrough case, or if my children were to become infected, who would we likely be catching it from ?  Those  refuse to be vaccinated.

In turn, I refuse to apologize for having lost my patience with these folks, and the danger they pose to us all."
2021-07-22 17:24:37,"This is just the beginning.  Due to the lack of vaccination in the U.S., the essentially unvaccinated regions of the developing world, the covid virus will eventually emerge with multiple variants, some of those quite infectious and possibly some that are quite deadly.  If we get such a variant, or if Covid+flu this winter results in a superbug, and we are not able to develop corresponding vaccines, we could be in severe trouble.  This response to the pandemic as if ""it's over"" is nothing short of denial and wishful thinking.  We are just getting started, and we better hope that vaccine development and global public health efforts can stem what otherwise could be catastrophic."
2021-07-22 17:24:44,"How responsible is it for you to report that ""breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are still relatively uncommon""?

2021-07-22 17:24:58,"""The problem grows worse as community transmission rates rise, because exposures in dose and number will increase. ""

This needed to be the headline, not buried in the article and stated with technical terms.  The MAJOR lie being spread on cable propaganda is that the decision to not get the vaccine affects only the individual.  For the majority, the fact that this medicine is necessary for the well being of the entire community rather than just the individual receiving it is a difficult concept.  It's not intuitive.  That makes lying about how the decision is a matter of individual rights easy.  
It is not a difficult message.  The pieces are already well known.  We've all heard about herd immunity.  We all know that the vaccine isn't 100% protective.  NYT just has to help connect the dots in order to counter the lies, or, if you insist, misinformation."
2021-07-22 17:25:23,"The antivaccers are the problem. 

Virtually no one who is vaccinated has died and 97 percent of those in hospitals are unvaccinated.

Come on, man, get vaccinated."
2021-07-22 17:25:29,"Vaccines do not prevent you from getting diseases. 

What they do is get your immune system to put them down fast. So fast, that most people don't show symptoms.

Some people have slow immune systems that put down the virus slower, so they get breakthrough symptoms. 

But even these people are better off than if they didn't get the vaccine because their system at reacted a lot faster than with no preparation from a vaccine. 

This is normal. End of story."
2021-07-22 17:27:29,"I think it is dead wrong for Trudeau to be opening our border to fully vaccinated Americans because inevitably there will be fully vaccinated Americans coming to the border who are asymptomatic carriers of the Delta virus.  Not every fully vaccinated person who gets the Delta virus will feel sick.

As with your children, none of our children 12 years of age and under are vaccinated.  Research in Israel and the United Kingdom is showing that the Delta variant is more prevalent among children than earlier variants.

In many of your states at most 40% of people are vaccinated.  The Delta variant is now responsible for greater than 80% of your cases.

Getting our kids back to school should be our highest priority for their physical and mental health, and that of their parents.  Border should stay closed."
2021-07-22 17:29:39,Would it be correct to say that fully vaccinated people spread the virus in the same way as unvaccinated people? Why?
2021-07-22 17:30:43,"Whatever it is, not going to wear a mask.  This is it - this is what we have.  I'm vaccinated and I understand I may get sick.  We aren't going to beat this thing with masks or vaccines despite our best efforts.  Might as well have it run its course."
2021-07-22 17:30:48,"It would be interesting to see a rigorous study of both vaccinated and previously infected individuals, comparing their immunity going forward.  I don't know why this sort of study is not being conducted."
2021-07-22 17:30:54,"I got the J&J vaccine because it was the first available one. However, the mixed messages on the effectiveness of this vaccine against the Delta variant is worrying me. My family planned a vacation in August, but I am getting worried about catching the virus during the flight. Should I go get a dose of Pfizer/Moderna vaccine? I wish the CDC would come out with some guidance on what folks who got J&J vaccine should do in light of the two recently published reports with opposite conclusions."
2021-07-22 17:34:51,"The onus is now on the unvaccinated to get their shots.
They should be grateful to those who are immunized when we wear masks, because our lives are not on the line - theirs are, even though the odds of lethal transmission are exceedingly minimal.
Also, let's get moving on vaccinating the under-twelve segment; they really should be able to attend school unmasked."
2021-07-22 17:35:54,"At this point, people who are unvaccinated in the US deserve to be hospitalized, or worse, with COVID. I have zero sympathy for them and will not resume wearing a mask to accommodate their poor choices."
2021-07-22 17:37:01,"It's just very sad and unfortunate we have to fight coronavirus and each other. People believing the anti-vaxx misinformation on social media are doing a disservice to themselves, their families and all the rest of us. 

The virus will continue to mutate into more contagious and deadly variants hosted by those refusing to be vaccinated."
2021-07-22 17:37:22,"The US guidance on masking it interesting--and problematic. Heaven knows we have had our ups and down in Europe, but here in the Czech Republic, where Pfizer vaccination rates are high and growing (over 50% fully vaccinated) mask requirements are still in wide use and are enforced.  Pretty much anywhere indoors--in all stores, all public transportation, etc,-- mask are still required, and those masks are usually respirators--KN95s and their equivalents.  On the other hand, bars are also open--and sure enough, that's where the outbreaks happen."
2021-07-22 17:39:36,I don’t understand why the indoor mask mandate was lifted when kids under 12 cannot be vaccinated and they may be tested in order to attend school.  Especially since even vaccinated folks can become infected and transmit the virus.  Either stop testing kids under 12 who are asymptotic or reinstate the indoor mask mandate to reduce their exposure.  Kids might not get sick but do they really need to miss more school because they test positive from exposure to foolish adults?
2021-07-22 17:39:36,"In Ireland at present 10% of new Covid cases and 20% of hospitalisations are in the unvaccinated, but 0% of the deaths."
2021-07-22 17:40:33,"Actually, the breakthrough infections are likely  occurring amongst vaccinated who are not generating a detectable antibody response.  You don't know this unless you check your spike protein antibody levels before you get sick. The  CDC has told us it is not necessary because the vaccine makers promised us every one made antibodies on their neutralizing antibody tests during their trials. So of course we should believe them and why bother testing to confirm antibody responses. Pfizer now says a booster is needed to prevent delta variant infections. But the CDC objects apparently they choose to believe data that suits their narrative rather than true results. I have tested over 350 of my patients and 10% have no detectable antibodies after full vaccination--that is enough to account for all the breakthrough infections we have seen to date. Boosters will prevent  these people from getting breakthrough infections."
2021-07-22 17:40:53,"The CDC has data for 10,000 breakthrough infections. It knows exactly what vaccines were administered. Why not tell us which vaccine had more breakthrough infections? There is some evidence that J and J is less effective. Share this information to health care providers so that we may not continue to administer a less effective vaccine."
2021-07-22 17:41:22,"They're getting infected because no vaccination ever developed in the history of the world for any disease has ever been able to guarantee immunity to 100% of those receiving a vaccination.

The covid vaccines are predicted to protect somewhere around 92% plus or minus for those receiving the vaccines.  They also predict almost all of those that get covid despite being vaccinated will get a much milder case than those that are unvaccinated.

I believe that of the 168 million unvaccinated 134 million of them will get infected before herd immunity among the unvaccinated is achieved if 80% is what it takes to achieve herd immunity.

Of those 134 million that get infected, I believe that if 2% is the mortality rate for this version of covid then over 2.5 million of them will die.

That's in addition to the 600 thousand that have already died.

I believe all of that will unfold within a year or so from now.

Please get vaccinated."
2021-07-22 17:41:48,"Saying that fully-vaccinated people don't need to be tested is a convenient cop-out and yet another hypocritical double-standard, however necessary it might be to prevent wholesome social and economic paralysis.  Clearly fully-vaccinated people test positive for Covid.  Saying they don't need to be tested is this summer's equivalent of Nancy Pelosi's beauty appointment, or Gavin Newsom's fancy dinner in the French Laundry.  People want to avoid the massive inconvenience and disruption created by strict protocols, even as they expect others to follow them.  What a mess these people have created.  They have really painted themselves into a corner."
2021-07-22 17:41:51,"Below is a snippet demonstrating an important bit of reporting. Unfortunately the quote is buried near the end. The reporter is to be commended for not avoiding context of data reporting. It is all-to-common to attempt to simplify by avoiding context when reporting the ""rate"" of anything occuring in a population. The point here being the same percentage (of infection) depends upon when, who, and where different samples are taken. 

""News reports often cite the percent of hospitalized people who are vaccinated as a measure of the vaccines’s effectiveness, but that number is easy to misinterpret, she cautioned. The proportion of vaccinated people who fall ill will rise over time as the vaccinated population rises and fewer people overall are hospitalized for Covid-19 (Kristen Panthagani, a geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine) noted."""
2021-07-22 17:42:15,"Giving people the impression that getting vaccinated meant that the pandemic was essentially over for them was monumentally stupid when combined with the lifting of restrictions. In Oregon all business restrictions and mask requirements were dropped at the same time. Now vaccinated people feel overconfident and, I assume, many unvaccinated people are taking this as a license to take zero precautions. We could have reopened things to give businesses some relief while continuing to require masks indoors FOR EVERYONE. Businesses can't enforce masks for unvaccinated people only, and the honor system is obviously a joke. Now we're seeing daily numbers that are double to triple what they were a month ago, but  this doesn't seem to be big news, so I haven't really seen people change their behavior accordingly.

People who aren't vaccinated, other than due to contraindications, can largely be assumed to not be masking if not required to."
2021-07-22 17:42:32,"We turned down a wedding invitation for late August due to uncertainty as to whether the invited guests were vaccinated or not. I'm 64, my wife is 63 and she's immune-suppressed due to taking methotrexate for her rheumatoid arthritis. We were both fully vaccinated in March with the Pfizer vaccine, but we've repeatedly read and been advised that my wife's ""immunity"" is only 2/3 or what mine is due to her use of methotrexate.

The last thing we want to do is be indoors for several hours with around 150 people not knowing their ""status"". So we respectfully declined the invitation, sent a very generous gift, and were ""greeted"" with a bare bones thank you note of a couple of lines. 

Sorry, our health and well-being comes first, especially given the rampant spread of the Delta Variant, even among vaccinated persons."
2021-07-22 17:43:03,"It is important to report the difference between temporary colonization with the virus and infection.  

Many of these 'positive' tests in people who have been vaccinated are from mass testing of asymptomatic individuals who may have been briefly colonized by an infected individual.   Their vaccination allows them to destroy the virus before it invades their body when the virus is still on their mucosal surfaces.  The PCR tests are so sensitive that they can pick up very small amounts of virus or even parts of a virus that will do no harm.

This is NOT a vaccination failure and should not be reported as such.  The vaccines are extremely affective at preventing hospitalization, death, and disability.  

Any suggestion that this is not the case does a disservice to our society.  Words matter and how they are phrased is very important in such a polarized world."
2021-07-22 17:44:19,"“The takeaway message remains, if you’re vaccinated, you are protected,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. “You are not going to end up with severe disease, hospitalization or death.”

That is not true according to recent news articles in NPR and this paper, and the CDC. About 3% of hospitalizations have been vaccinated and according to Texas Department of Health, 43 people out of 9000 who died of Covid in Texas were vaccinated. Furthermore, there are no studies I am aware of that talk about long-haul Covid in people who have been vaccinated.

My point is that people should be 100% accurate in what they say otherwise it just creates confusion and distrust. Protection is probably the wrong word to use as it implies absolute immunity, which is not the case. To be sure, everyone should get vaccinated but we really need our medical authorities to be precise in their language."
2021-07-22 17:44:54,"Simply put, if a person ""chooses"" to no get vaccinated that should mean they choose to not burden ""the system"" with their illness."
2021-07-22 17:46:43,"What percentage of positive test among the vaccinated turn into even mild covid cases.
I wonder of there are statistics on the immunized?

Of  those test positive how many shrug off he virus within a week, 
How many get symptoms of covid. 
How many are infectious to others.

The test is very very  sensitive maybe it means nothing in 90% of vaccinated people. Revealing nothing more than a ephemeral passive low level contact."
2021-07-22 17:48:07,"I don't understand why, if the CDC considers a breakthrough infection mild/not a big deal because you ""just"" get a fever of 101-102 for 3 or 4 days and stay in bed for a week, they make such a big deal of getting a flu shot every year, because those ""mild"" breakthrough symptoms are basically the same as flu, no?

I am not a good patient, hate getting sick, do all I can to avoid cold and flu. I am also in my 70s. I would be very unhappy if I got a breakthrough infection and a doc told me it was no big deal, that I was ""lucky"" I wasn't in hospital on a ventilator or dead.

Why don't some of these smarty pants docs stop telling me I'm lucky and do something about getting the unvaccinated vaccinated? I actually have a doc who wants me to have a procedure at an outpatient facility that won't disclose if all its employees are vaccinated. And they wonder why people aren't going back for routine care!"
2021-07-22 17:48:17,"All evidence shows that the vaccines are effective and also not perfect. For many, those are opposing or contradictory ideas, and difficult to understand much less accept. 

That said, how many breakthrough infections would/will occur if the rates of vaccinations were higher? Let’s not mince words. So many voices of regret in the media from unvaccinated victims of COVID. They regret not getting the vaccine when they or a loved one becomes sick, suffers and sometimes, sadly,  passes away. They made choices that affected themselves, loved ones, and likely many others whom they don’t even know. 

My heart goes out to all of them, us really. All of us in our community lose when we don’t come together."
2021-07-22 17:48:43,"It is a vaccine, not a force field. The Vaccine is in you and the virus must enter you for the Vaccine to then do its job. Vaccinated people do test positive when they have the vaccine onboard however that does not mean they will have significant symptoms or even realize they have been exposed. So far there have been no Breakthrough infections. There are just that 3 to 5% who did the right thing and got vaccinated but for whatever reason their bodies don't process the vaccine effectively.  That is why the why it has been reported that the vaccine is 95% effective and not 100%.  Increasing the vaccination rate is the only why forward."
2021-07-22 17:49:35,"I have been fully vaccinated sine March 2021 and the following is why I continue to wear a mask-  ""For the average vaccinated person, a breakthrough infection is likely to be inconsequential, causing few to no symptoms. But there is concern among scientists that a few vaccinated people who become infected may go on to develop long Covid, a poorly understood constellation of symptoms that persists after the active infection is resolved.""
I do NOT want long Covid. 
It infuriates me that we have found ourselves in a predicament where recalcitrants and anti-social, selfish, ignorant people are threatening the welfare of the rest of us.
It didn't have to be this way."
2021-07-22 17:50:29,"I'm writing this from my isolated cottage after being diagnosed yesterday with my symptoms starting 3 days ago.  Low grade fever, cough, sore throat, no taste or smell.    I isolated right away after hearing of all the breakthrough infection right after getting my PCR test.  I was fully vaccinated with Pfizer since January.  My issue is I think the CDC needs to look into pushing boosters - as the article suggests, I think my immunity has waned over the past 6 months since my second shot and thus I contracted the Delta variant for that reason.  Once I fully recover, I plan on getting another series of vaccines as boosters."
2021-07-22 17:50:32,"I was fully vaccinated in February and after testing positive, am currently on Day 9 of the Delta variant (at least I'm assuming given the symptoms).

2021-07-22 17:52:47,"I am fully vaccinated and have been for months.  However, I continue to mask when when shopping and/or anywhere that I am in a closed situation.  Why?  Because children under 12 are still not able to get the vaccine; they are vulnerable.  As a good citizen, for the common good, I mask simply because as has been explained the fully vaccinated may get a breakthrough infection without symptoms.  How devastated I would be to think I infected a baby next to me at the checkout line, or the maskless child anywhere I am in a closed situation.  What do those opposed to masking think a communicable disease is?"
2021-07-22 17:52:48,"We should be tracking ALL breakthrough cases,
not just those leading to hospitalization and death. The CDC continues to obfuscate as to their reasons, but obviously in part they’re trying to avoid encouraging any excuse not to get vaccinated. The unvaccinated are ruining our lives and our health, and I’m sick of the pampering, hand holding, and coddling they’ve received. Macron has it right: if you don’t get vaccinated you don’t get to attend public events or eat in restaurants or cafes. There was a stampede to get vaccinated in France, but we’re too timid to follow suit."
2021-07-22 17:53:22,"My wife and I have been vaccinated and we are distressed that a few of our friends have chosen not to be vaccinated.  Nevertheless, we are also disturbed by the narrow narrative that continues to dominate any discussion of Covid.  The open exchange of differing perspectives is good for all us.  For example, see: <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/panic-pandemic"" target=""_blank"">https://www.city-journal.org/panic-pandemic</a>."
2021-07-22 17:53:22,I do not mind wearing a mask at all. I haven't been sick from the usual microbes at all. I don't mind how it conceals most of my face either. It's my personal Fourth Amendment accessory. Never had a Facebook account and I like paying cash. Too many Ken Follet books when I was young. The main character survives by being unmemorable. A mask feels right. I got two Moderna shots last winter.
2021-07-22 17:53:55,"'Much has been made of Delta’s ability to sidestep immune defenses. In fact, all of the existing vaccines seem able to prevent serious illness and death from the variant (although questions lately have been raised about the Johnson & Johnson shot).'

The CDC refuses to track infections that *don't* result in severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Why haven't they recommended that those of us who got the J&J vaccine get vaccinated with one of the more efficacious mRNA vaccines? 

I got the J&J vaccine months ago, because I complied with the request from the CDC, state, and county government to just take the first vaccine available. Don't worry about the clearly poorer efficacy of the J&J vaccine. 

I didn't report my vaccination to my doctor, and yet it showed up in my cardiologist's EHR within a few days. If I show up at a pharmacy to get another vaccine, they will see that information and won't provide a vaccine. 

While I'm not stupid, I feel stupid for having bought in to what the governor and county executive said in March. They must have known that the shortage of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines was very temporary. Those vaccines became available within a few days after I got the J&J vaccine."
2021-07-22 17:55:06,It amazes me that in an “advanced” country like the US we have to explain what vaccine efficacy means.
2021-07-22 17:55:07,"As someone who gets the flu shot annually, this isn't surprising.  I never really expect the flu shot to prevent infection but to lower the severity of the symptoms  if I ever become infected.  That's generally been my experience.  Someone close to me gets the flu, passes it to me; they're knocked out for a week and I get a minor or mild cold.

I wish the flu shot was as effective as these mRNA vaccines.  I would be pretty cavalier in the winter months if that was the case."
2021-07-22 17:55:23,"I think there needs to be some clarification about the term “breakthrough infection” in the media. It’s my understanding that vaccinated individuals have immune systems that are primed to recognize and fight Covid quickly, before it develops into a serious infection. 

However, inhaling virus is still going to force your immune system to fight; you’re still infected, even if it’s asymptomatic and of short duration. So what exactly is a “breakthrough”? Do mild/asymptomatic cases really count as “breakthrough” cases, and if so, why?"
2021-07-22 17:55:43,"Any non-quack doctor will tell you that a vaccine which works 95% of the time is effective. Given that there are at least 350,000,000 people in this country, a vaccine that is 95% effective means that even if every person in this country got vaccinated,  approximately 17,500,000 of them would still be at risk of contracting Covid 19.  But only cynical Republicans trying to pander to the millions of ignorant and skeptical voters out there would therefore speak out against vaccination.  The problem is that Republican leaders have done their own math.  They have figured that it's better to lose the votes of a relatively small number of people who die or become seriously ill because they refused to be vaccinated, than the votes of millions who object to being ordered, or even strongly urged, to getting vaccinated."
2021-07-22 17:56:13,"It is important to note that those who are vaccinated and get a ""breakthrough infection"" do not suffer the extreme symptoms of Covid. No vaccine or drug is 100% effective, there are always ways for a bacteria or virus to get through. That is life and we have to deal with it.

We should focus on the fact that of those dying of Covid, 99% were non-vaccinated. Those who are vaccinated seem to have milder Covid symptoms and do not require long or serious hospitalizations."
2021-07-22 17:57:16,"Mild symptoms after breakthrough infection does not prove the vaccines work.  Most people don't get severe infection symptoms with Covid anyway without a vaccine. I believe in 
 using the vaccines but they are not necessarily working for everyone."
2021-07-22 18:00:29,"Once again, reporters are writing the wrong article about “breakthrough” infections because of a lack of good data from government. 

What we need to know is what percentage of vaccinated individuals who get Covid delta relative to unvaccinated, what percent end up in the hospital, and how does hospitalization segment by age, and those with major co-morbidities, immunocompromised, and generally heathy. 

Instead we get stories filled with anecdotal information, misleading statistics and fear inducing deductions that don’t guide appropriate action. 

One would have thought after a year the foundations for strong data collection would finally be in place at the state or federal level. Without it we will not focus where action is most needed, make it less enticing for the unvaccinated to get vaccinated, and underinvest to protect those truly at risk."
2021-07-22 18:03:27,"In the case of the J&J vaccine ""anywhere from 33% to 60%, we're not quite sure and not doing much to find out"" isn't 100% either."
2021-07-22 18:07:27,"Too many people think of everything as all or nothing.  In this case, some people think either the vaccine always works or it does not work.

Think of it this way.  If you get a vaccine that is 90% effective, and no one else is vaccinated, you have a tenth as much chance of getting infected if you are exposed.  If everyone else is vaccinated, your chances of getting exposed fall to a tenth of what is was.  So now you are 100 times less likely to be exposed and be infected.  Now there is a feedback loop, if new infections fall by a factor of one hundred, the chances of being exposed fall by a factor of 100, and new infections fall rapidly.  That is herd immunity.  That is our best chance of ending the pandemic.

So the best thing we can do is for everybody to be vaccinated as soon as it is available to them.  This should not be confusing, but it does require a bit of numeracy to understand."
2021-07-22 18:08:56,Not sure why this is a surprise to anyone.  We’ve been told breakthrough infections are possible since the vaccine came out.  And we’ve been told that infection for vaccinated would be less severe.  This is no surprise of you listen to the experts…the expert is Dr. Fauci.  He has kept us well informed.
2021-07-22 18:08:59,"Wow, a lot of backpedaling here along with contingent language about what this vaccine will and won’t do.  These vaccines were initially presented as being able to stop the virus in its tracks, basically the vaccinated were free to remove their masks and resume pre-Covid life.  Since that has proven not to be true, we are being lectured about the “true role” of vaccines and scolded for believing what the CDC, medical experts and the media said previously."
2021-07-22 18:09:39,"This is why I continue to wear my mask (esp with J & J vaccine), even in my highly vaccinated state.  When it comes to health and COVID, you can’t be too careful.  What is the cost of wearing a mask but a bit of discomfort ?  At least there are no crazies here objecting to them…

I do think the CDC was too quick in telling vaccinated people they no longer need to wear masks - it sounded more like a political decision (reward for getting vaccinated) than a sound medical one…"
2021-07-22 18:10:36,"My partner and I are at Day 7 of our ""break through"" infections. Both of us are double vaccinated. We continue to suffer night sweats, exhaustion and congestion as well as coughing. We took great care throughout the pandemic and put this down to a beer and football at the pub. It's nasty. Like an extremely bad flu. I am thankful I was vaccinated and encourage those thinking about to get the jab."
2021-07-22 18:12:51,"Missing from this article at ALL is any mention of the fact that as more breakthrough infections occur, we’re giving the virus more opportunity to learn how to multiply inside a vaccinated body. This is where strains that are even less affected by a person’s vaccine status will come from. Vaccinated people getting COVID is not only bad now for those people, but is where the next stage of the crisis will come from. Vaccinated people need to still be masking, still be washing hands, still be judicious about hanging out in large indoor crowds - otherwise we’re volunteering our vaccinated selves as Petri dishes to help develop the strain that will set us back at square one."
2021-07-22 18:12:58,"Perhaps this is somewhat tangential; but, here goes.  During the height of pandemic and before vaccine, I postponed several diagnostic procedures. Got vaccine.  Completed mammogram before Delta.  

My specific concern is that medical personnel aren't all vaccinated (in fact, it seems many are not).  And they aren't required to disclose.  Now I have an overdue colonoscopy ... what level of concern is rational in this case?  Ditto dental."
2021-07-22 18:14:34,"Think of the vaccines as more of a flu shot. If you get the flu shot you may still get the flu, but usually not as bad; and if you get the mRNA you may still get Covid, just not as serious. The vaccines protect you and save your life, but they don't eliminate the chance infection. 

Looking at how this is going, I think Covid shots will be a yearly thing, similar to the the flu shot, with scientist trying to predict that yearly variant. But the yearly Covid shots will administered with much more urgency and demand, I think - at least for the next few years."
2021-07-22 18:17:13,I know that judging and shaming people is not an effective way to solve this problem but Why?  Because people are awful and selfish. And apropos of that THANK YOU to every single person who has gotten all their vaccines over the years from small pox (can;t find my scar anymore but I got it) to polio to measles to Covid. Your selflessness has saved millions of lives.
2021-07-22 18:18:44,"In our state most of the people who refuse to wear masks also refuse to get vaccinated, so when the CDC said that vaccinated people could stop wearing masks, I just groaned. Because of course the people who aren’t vaccinated just took off their masks, and simply lie about their vaccination status. Our governor encourages the liars by refusing to allow cities, counties, or businesses to require masks. So you can bet that the people who are wearing masks are vaccinated people trying to protect themselves against the unmasked, unvaccinated liars. I doubt if the CDC, when issuing the directive that vaccinated folks could remove their masks safely, ever took into account the number of people who are perfectly willing to lie in order to evade responsibility to their fellow human beings. But considering the fact that 74 million people voted for one of the biggest liars in the country for president, is it really surprising that lying has become acceptable behavior?"
2021-07-22 18:23:56,"The ""a few"" part of the comment about ""concern among scientists that a few vaccinated people who become infected may go on to develop long Covid"" is, frankly, absurd.

Define ""a few""? Is it as in ""you can count them on one hand"" and in July, 2022 four vaccinated people will have long Covid from the Delta variant, as implied?

In addition, it seems like the higher viral load of the Delta variant even for mild cases among the vaccinated, along with premature de-masking, have the potential to significantly increase the prevalence of long Covid--with symptoms that can be debilitating according to earlier reporting in this newspaper--which could prove to be devastating in coming months and years.

I fear that we got complacent, which is reckless in the context of a pandemic."
2021-07-22 18:24:06,"Why then would the CDC give people who were fully vaccinated permission to dispense with masks indoors without some kind of proof?  

That left us very vulnerable, as we all know that the incentive to wear masks was essentially removed for those who are careless, lazy, cut corners, have no decency or lack regard for their fellow humans. 

I’m furious at their incompetence and their inability to 
fully think through the possible consequences of their decision. Their belief in human decency was misplaced. 

Scientists? Not impressive."
2021-07-22 18:24:55,"Next time there's a pandemic and everyone gets a $1400 check while there's a vaccine, let's pay out $1200 up front and save the last $200 for when they get vaccinated.  Would have made things a lot easier."
2021-07-22 18:25:04,"The vaccines enable a healthy immune system system to fight back once infected. So yes, you can get infected if vaccinated, but you are unlikely to get sick because the vaccines have empowered the immune system to mount a response. If we weren’t constantly testing asymptomatic or people, this wouldn’t be an issue."
2021-07-22 18:28:09,"I'm vaccinated, and still going grocery shopping masked. While I knew people had bad hygiene habits before COVID, it wasn't until they lifted the indoor mandate up here to realize how truly disgusting people can be in public. Coughing into the air, wiping their noses with their hands, not using a tissue—or the crook of their elbow—when sneezing, et al..

I'm resolved to wearing a mask in public for the unforeseeable future, even after this horrific virus is done with us."
2021-07-22 18:32:27,"""The highly contagious variant, combined with the near absence of preventive restrictions, is fueling a rapid rise in cases in all states, and hospitalizations in nearly all of them. It now accounts for about 83 percent of infections diagnosed in the United States.""

This statement is practically verbatim what some doctors I know had been predicting in April and May.  They thought the C.D.C. was acting prematurely with the ""near absence of preventive restrictions"" when less than half of the country is fully vaccinated.

Three of my co-workers who were fully vaccinated caught COVID, one of which is in the hospital.  Another reason why I continue to mask and keep healthy distances from folks I don't know.

My nephew flew to Vegas two weeks ago to get married.  Neither he nor his bride nor any of their guests believe in vaccinations.  Now they both are sick with COVID, he is in the hospital.  I keep thinking they probably got in that weekend, partying all over the place, no precautions, and then flew home.  I wonder how many folks may have gotten COVID from these two irresponsible and selfish knuckleheads while flying back from Vegas?

I completely agree that by no means are we out of the woods yet.  Heck, we can't even see the clearing yet. . ."
2021-07-22 18:34:04,"So the point of this is what? Wear masks forever? Get boosters every other week? Avoid every party or concert for the rest of our lives? Readers suggest that no matter how extreme the advice, it's acceptable to follow in the age of COVID. I received my vaccine and wear masks when required. But I'm not going to let this virus rule my life. We will all pass away no matter how careful we are. If others want to masks constantly and hide in their houses away from people, that's their choice. But I will continue living without constant fear of this virus."
2021-07-22 18:34:50,"None of the vaccines are 100% effective, so of course vaccinated people will get sick.  I don't understand the scrutiny the breakthrough cases get.    Why is anyone surprised?"
2021-07-22 18:38:13,"In our rural county in Colorado recently, 2 of the 5 Covid deaths reported in a given month were fully vaccinated. I don't think we know enough to be making the kind of assurances about efficacy that official sources are using to convince people. I'm a healthy 75 year old who has done well with a personal policy of avoiding doctors like the plague. But I got vaccinated because I wanted to reassure friends and family, who believed I was at risk, and I'm willing to run the risk of adverse reactions, since I've lived long enough. 
I much prefer to have incomplete and imperfect information presented straightforwardly. You could never have persuaded me that any of the current vaccines are safe. I chose to get the J&J because they did acknowledge issues with it and paused availability. That is the kind of corporate behavior that gives me confidence - unlike the hype that the medical industries can't seem to resist. I could be persuaded for reasons of solidarity, but not by exaggerated claims of safety and efficacy which it is much too early to make."
2021-07-22 18:40:51,"""Infected players are required to quarantine, so the project has not been able to track whether they spread the virus to others — but it’s likely that they would, he added.""
""As the Delta variant surges across the nation, reports of so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people have become increasingly frequent — including, most recently, when at least six Texas Democrats and an aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi tested positive"" - nobody has ""been able to track whether they spread the virus to others - but it’s likely that they would"""
2021-07-22 18:41:50,"One has to ask if they are not, in a sense, false positives, viz., they have low-level covid due to the vaccine.  After all, regardless of one's vaccine source, all have had many show signs of illness/bad reactions/side effects.

But to believe that the vaccine makes one invulnerable to the disease is simply naive.  I have gotten a flu shot yearly for a good 15 years, pretty sure.  And I have gotten the flu at least twice, both nasty.

Measles/etc. vaccines we generally believe to be 100-percent, and effectively they are.  But they are not 100-percent.  Are *not*.

So vaccines help, immensely, until they do not.  Sort of how life works.

But the media does not help.  Too much info, often emotive and sensational.  ""More"" is not better.  I'll leave it at that."
2021-07-22 18:43:28,"Is this article supposed to be some kind of prevarication for the sad awful truth? Why are we still making excuses?, for argument?

The intelligent, caring people tried. The smarter humans tried. Most governments, predominantly, had this virus on the run. It is not their fault we will now have to live in flux with this virus.
This is not a political failure. This is not a medical failure. This isn't even a financial failure due to funding or greed, amazingly. This is a moral failure, a social failure and a character failure.

Half the human race in existence decided they did not want to partake. Distrustful, slothful, presumptuous, and sometimes even spiteful. Many simply didn't have the courage to step up for the good of all. They decided not to show up for the battle. How sad is that."
2021-07-22 18:46:33,"We were told the best thing we could do is lockdown, mask up, and flatten the curve until the vaccines arrived. The vaccines have arrived, but they didn't magically solve our problems, and now it seems like no public health body (that I'm aware of) has a plan for what happens next.

Do we keep locking down? Do we just give up and accept that lots of us may get long-covid or even new variant arising in the billions of unvaccinated around the world? Some global leadership is definitely needed."
2021-07-22 18:47:15,"In all the reporting about Covid outbreaks in countries using Chinese vaccines (which are not as effective as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines used here, but which are still very effective in preventing serious cases), it almost seemed like a section of each media company's style manual required that the story mention that the outbreak ""raised questions"" about the efficacy of the Chinese vaccines.  Now that there are outbreaks in the U.S., however, the U.S. media seems to have forgotten the need to report that outbreak ""raised questions"" about the efficacy of the Prizer and Moderna vaccines.  Instead, we get stories like this one, that devote major column inches to explain why the outbreak does not mean that the vaccines lack efficacy.  Instead we get quotes from Dr. Fauci saying, ""By no means does [the current outbreak of breakthrough infections] mean that you're dealing with an unsuccessful vaccine.""  Which seems to indicate that Dr. Fauci is answering the ""questions of efficacy"" that the U.S. media somehow has neglected to mention as having been being ""raised."""
2021-07-22 18:53:10,"What we need to parse the welter of numbers are person-days of exposure risk and age breakdowns for vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals suffering hospitalization or death. A real comparison between them is impossible otherwise, as for example if the vaccinated are older on average than the others being hospitalized alongside them it means they were better-protected than a crude lineup would suggest. Older people are more vulnerable to begin with, and must be compared against age mates.

But the scoreboard offers a rough picture, and it’s clear that getting Covid shots reduces the burden of this disease. The University of Utah Hospital is again canceling elective surgeries to make room, and none of us wants to be the one who ends up in the ICU. Healthcare staff just isn’t up to dealing with another big surge. Let’s help out by making sure we’re fully vaccinated; clinics are taking walk-ins now."
2021-07-22 18:54:10,"I would be interested in knowing when the folks who had breakthrough infections were vaccinated, as it may give us more of a clue as to how long the vaccines last.  (That seems to be an unanswered question.)  Dr Fauci has said ""at least""  6-8 months.  If breakthrough infections happen mostly with those vaccinated in January as opposed to May, we may have our first solid clue."
2021-07-22 18:54:24,"While it is undeniable that the unvaccinated in each age group are at highest risk of bad outcomes, it is equally true that fully vaccinated elderly are at higher risk than unvaccinated teenagers.

For each age group, the probability of breakthrough hospitalization and death rises proportionally to community prevalence and transmissibility of the virus. Why? Because when calculating vaccine efficacy (VE), the comparator is the unvaccinated without immunity from prior infection. Greater numbers of this control group get sick in settings of higher prevalence and when a more contagious strain is dominant.  A constant VE between strains would imply a proportionate rise in illness among the fully vaxxed in the setting of the more contagious strain.  

In reality, most studies conclude VE against hospitalization and death for Delta is somewhat lower than for Alpha; i.e., the age-stratified rise in breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths is likely to be at least as high as the rise in community prevalence.

This may not matter much to the fully vaccinated young (under age 40) because their risk of hospitalization or death is quite low - even at times of high prevalence of a highly contagious strain.

However, it matters A LOT for the fully vaccinated elderly. Extrapolating to a national level data published by the MN Department of Health, the US could see more than 200 breakthrough deaths daily in this age group if we allow prevalence to reach current UK levels."
2021-07-22 18:55:13,"I am surprised to see so many misunderstanding of vaccine even among doctors.First of all, vaccine does not create a ""magic shield"" so you don't get virus. You do, vaccinated or not. So positive result should not be surprised. Vaccine make your body recognize the virus at early stage so it can effectively eliminate it in short time to prevent damage so you don't feel symptoms. Second, ""break though"" happens only when people get sick enough to be hospitalized. Third, it happens doesn't necessarily means vaccine not effective because other factors play roles too: immune system, underline condition."
2021-07-22 18:55:33,"There have been numerous anecdotal reports of entire vacation households of vaccinated tourists testing positive soon after leaving Provincetown. It is possible they had multiple exposures as circuit boy week was followed by bear week with thousands upon thousands of men out partying in the clubs and congregating on Commercial St. However, given that entire households tested positive, it would seem the delta variant is quite contagious even for the vaccinated. The question is how much more contagious. Local businesses are now requiring masks. People are taking greater precautions. It would be prudent to maintain the same restrictions implemented last year. Perhaps the town will reinstitute mask requirements, at least in all public spaces. Proof of vaccination is now being required to enter many of the clubs and some restaurants but the entire country needs a national vaccine passport similar to a driver’s licence, a document that can’t be easily forged. All that being said, one can still enjoy the natural beauty of the beaches and national seashore, go biking, see friends outside, and take other precautions that limit risk."
2021-07-22 18:55:52,Which risk is bigger: a vaccinated person to get infected or an unvaccinated child to get infected?
2021-07-22 18:57:05,"Getting quite tired of the use of the term ""mild"" in these articles. ""Mild"" pretty much means ""not severe"", not oh we might just get a case of the sniffles. Maybe that's all you get. Maybe you get a flu-like case with high fever and you're out for a week. That is still ""mild"". That said I'd rather have ""mild"" then end up in the hospital, or worse."
2021-07-22 18:57:27,"This is one of those mom-splaining things. ""If I've said it once"" etc. If the virus is in the air and you inhale, especially if you aren't masked, the virus is going to get in. It will infect the inside of your nose and most likely make it past the filtering system in your nose and down to your throat and lungs. When the virus enters your cells and starts to replicate, your vaccinated immune system will recognize it and go to work. How long it takes your body to clear out the virus depends on how much virus got into your system and how strongly your immune system responds. Whether you get symptoms or not depends on the same things. Getting infected may be no big deal for you, but if we learn you can infect people around you during this process we've all got to be so much more careful. With the Delta variant, apparently that goes double. End of mom-splaining.

Here in Texas, I will stay masked indoors and social distance as long as it takes, because very few people wear masks here any more and only forty-some percent are fully vaccinated. Lack of information about long covid adds to my caution."
2021-07-22 19:03:05,"Vaccination does NOT prevent you from getting infected, it prevents you from getting really sick. When you are infected you can spread it to others, even if you are vaccinated. Since covid19 is spread primarily through asymptomatic transmission, then it seems likely that much of the current uptick is being driven [counterintuitively] by vaccinated people, particularly those who have decided everything can go back to normal. Personally, I think the medical community and media have not done a very good job in informing the public what vaccination actually protects against and the important difference between being infected and getting sick . Thanks to NYT for providing some clarification in this article."
2021-07-22 19:04:05,Time for people who actually care about the welfare of their fellow citizens and take the appropriate steps to combat the spread of Covid-19 to break away from this country and form their own.  What’s left will still be the U.S. But it will stand for the Unvaccinated States.
2021-07-22 19:04:21,"These breakthrough cases are so uncommon that I personally know six people who have tested positive in the past week, including one who has been very sick for 12 days. As with so much of the pandemic, the media is playing catch-up on the story, yet again.

The very sick friend has been in frequent contact with the Dep. of Health and they said him having nearly all the major symptoms is unusual, and the concern is the virus is mutating again. He was also told that Delta, unlike the earlier version, does in fact cling to surfaces for several days, so wash and sanitize!

I lay this on the CDC and the bizarre move of suddenly dropping the mask recommendation, starting a totally expected free-for-all. I never stopped masking in stores and that has proven to be the right course of action.

Yes, as a vaccinated person, I may not die from it, but NO THANKS, I'd just assume not get it at all."
2021-07-22 19:09:47,"As a person who is fully and thankfully Moderna vaccinated, I realize that I could still catch COVID.  However, I feel SAFE AND SECURE in the knowledge that I will not get seriously sick or die from the horrible virus that has crippled the world.  That some ignorant people are resistant to this life-saving vaccine and spreading death and disease is a horror story in and of itself.  At this point, I have not one iota of sympathy for anyone who refuses the vaccine and gets sick.  We have to accept the fact that some people simply do not deserve to be part of a society where our choices affect others as well as ourselves, and therefore we show our respect for each other by taking precautions to keep ourselves as healthy and safe as possible."
2021-07-22 19:10:20,"As a doctor I am seeing more people with COVID. So far, for me, all are unvaccinated and the surprise to me has been the unwillingness of these sick people to mask or isolate when they go out. 
I explain that them, they take mask off, walk out and head to Costco. A large number of the ill people now are not containing anything so keep that in mind as you walk around the stores!!"
2021-07-22 19:10:58,Why isn’t the CDC keeping track of breakthrough infections? Did the big pharma lobbyists have anything to do with this decision? I’m liberal. But skeptical.
2021-07-22 19:15:33,"I am newly pregnant, have lupus and taking immunosuppressive medications which puts me at risk for a breakthrough infection. I received the Pfizer vaccine in March and heading back to the office in a couple weeks. I work hard to maintain a very healthy lifestyle in order to prevent weight issues (and others problems) that would make my condition worse. I did not choose to have a degenerative autoimmune disease. If you’re healthy and not worried about how Covid will affect you, please put yourself in my position. I need to protect myself and my baby, and others in my position deserve the same courtesy. You have the choice to get vaccinated or put on a mask again as cases continue to rise, so please do it for our sake.

I’m concerned about the lack of clear information regarding these breakthrough cases. I understand how vaccines work, which is why it was a bit surprising how quickly we were encouraged to abandon masks and other safety measures as if the pandemic had abruptly ended. I know this was to encourage people to get vaccinated but at this point I have little faith in those who are still holding out. If we’re so eager to resume normal life (sans masks and social distancing) we should start verifying vaccination status like France is doing now, and begin taking actionable steps to prevent a fourth wave."
2021-07-22 19:20:24,"Like many others, in mid-August my employer expects me to attend “Welcome Back” events to “get back to normal.” They’re all indoor events in old buildings with ancient filtration systems. Many of these gatherings will have around 200 people; breakout sessions about 40 people. 

This will occur in Seminole County, Florida, where the positivity rate is 17% and rising; COVID hospitalizations have doubled in one week; and the only people who wear masks are the vaccinated (58% of the county). My neighborhood bank (a bank!) closed because all its employees were infected. 

I’m high risk and vaccinated, but not comfortable walking into the belly of the beast even while masked up. Yet, I cannot antagonize my employer. I need my job. 

Summer of Freedom? Sorry, not feeling that. Just foreboding."
2021-07-22 19:22:10,"On February 25 2020 I experienced my first symptoms of COVID-19, before testing was available and the former guy was telling the country nothing to see here.  The illness progressed rapidly from gastric distress and general malaise to extreme shortness of breath, cardiac arrhythmia, joint pain, mysterious rashes etc.  19 months later and I am still too short of breath to stand for more than a few minutes without support, the rashes, joint pain and exacerbated allergic reactions continue.  I say this as a warning to those who think they are invincible.  We are now in a position similar to when I contracted the virus, case counts rising, public activities have resumed mostly mask less and false information perpetrated by right wing political hacks.  My life will never return to normal, I've come to terms with that but I can't accept that others would risk their lives and the lives of others to avoid wearing a mask."
2021-07-22 19:23:32,"It's very disturbing that this spike is happening just after most free testing and vaccination sites have been shut down, especially in states where populations are mostly vaccinated. There should be access for the ""healthy"" vaccinated in states with high numbers of vaccination rates to continue to get support with testing and those unvaccinated to get their shots ASAP. Those of us who followed the guidelines and kept health should not be left to multiple infection exposures by the anti-vaxers roaming unmasked and infected with no consideration for anyone else.  Isn't part of the breakthrough infection phenomenon due to so many unvaccinated and infected exposing the vaccinated to the extent that the immune response is overwhelmed?"
2021-07-22 19:24:03,"What is interesting is the lack of knowledge here -  from the statistics used which mostly come from previous variants (we have maybe 3 or 4 weeks of widespread experience with Delta in the US), to what impact this has on unvaccinated children under 12 or high risk elderly patients, to what the transmission rates are for vaccinated vs. vaccinated people. A lot of unknowns. What is clear is that a) when vaccinated you can still get Covid and b) that vaccine will most likely keep you from going to a hospital or dying. Those two bits of info should be enough for people to go out and get vaccinated and to maintain the precautions we were doing before."
2021-07-22 19:25:17,"The article seems to saying OK, the Delta variant is bad, more infectious and cases are increasing but don't worry you won't get too sick if you are vaccinated. If we've learned anything during this pandemic it's not to underestimate covid. The reassurance is good for today but what about tomorrow? Pfizer has submitted data showing antibody levels are falling for those vaccinated early on. This, before more deaths occur, is the time for boosters. Israel has begun this for certain immunocompromised groups so we should gear up too and not get caught with our guard down--again."
2021-07-22 19:25:26,"What are the numbers?? For more than a year the gov has been reporting the number of cases of c-19, now they are giving delta as percentages. What are the numbers of delta breakthroughs per state?"
2021-07-22 19:26:20,"I fail to understand the panic about the Delta variant.

The fact that it is more contagious, but no more deadly is a great feature. We will achieve high herd resistance to the Corona virus much faster with Delta. The combined vaccination rate and Delta spread will get us there, regardless if the last 1/3 of eligible people get the vaccine or not.

The key thing is to have hi levels of herd immunity (however acquired) before a more lethal strain arrives."
2021-07-22 19:26:39,"This is not new. In Israel, where vaccination rates are high, there have been reports of breakthrough infections for months. The thing is: these cases are mostly mild. So why should we worry? COVID is not going to wink out of existence; the goal is to reduce it to a “normal” disease like flu or cold, and this is only possible with vaccination. Will few vaccinated people get a serious case of COVID? Possibly. Will few of them die? Possibly. So what? People die of flu every year. Nobody can guarantee you risk-free existence. Life is about accessing risks, not about demanding that the world come to a standstill in order to make you safe. We have vaccines that give you sufficient protection. If you don’t use them, it’s on you. I am certainly not going to inconvenience myself in order to protect anti-vaxxers."
2021-07-22 19:26:54,"I know this sounds awful and like I'm following some sort of experimental vaccine, but I am genuinely interested in seeing what happens a year after people have been vaccinated, if they don't get vaccinated for covid-19 annually. Will the USA revert to pandemic levels of covid-19 or will the vaccine provide protection for life or a few years? These are questions that keep running through my mind. 
I also wonder if these vaccines will be like antibiotics and eventually be ineffective against superbugs. Superbugs = the new covid-19 variants.
I'm sure I'm not the only person pondering on all these variables."
2021-07-22 19:27:03,"The rhetoric of our leaders implies, and sometimes states, that only unvaccinated people are getting the virus. This is not the case, though being vaccinated helps a lot. But unmasking and then letting people mingle closely indoors is a foolish strategy. Even if masked, the mingling indoors would be a problem. The virus is in the air in these places as soon as one person with it walks in the door, or walked through the door last week. It is summertime -- we need to move everything outdoors as much as we can to fight this virus, and limit indoor space use to places that are lightly visited/populated. Clearly, though vaccinated people can get the virus and to some degree spread the virus, just not nearly as efficiently as unvaccinated people."

If I - as a vaccinated individual - can still infect others than the problem are the ""others"" that chose not to get vaccinated. Again, ss this article states, “vaccinated people can come down with infections, overwhelmingly asymptomatic to mild”. 

At this point in the game there have been plenty of opportunities for folks to get vaccinated. The unvaccinated make up ~99% of hospitalizations incl. ICU admits/mortality from COVID-19, not us vaccinated ones! It's obvious, the ""problem"" are the unvacinated among us and because of ""them"" I (soon) have to start wearing a mask (indoor) again?

We need more information to understand the risk to vaccinated people as well as the chances that vaccinated individuals can spread the disease. 

I was appalled a few weeks ago to see images of a rock concert in NYC with 20,000 screaming, singing fans packed into an inside venue like sardines.  The event had a vaccine requirement, and it would surely be interesting to know if any clusters of outbreaks followed.

I am worn out by the mixed messaging from CDC.  They should never have made that ""no masking for vaccinated"" statement -- it contributed to the havoc, and now trying to backtrack towards preventative measures is even more difficult as Delta surges."

It's not even mentioned in this article as if young children are of no consequence. There is no guidance from the CDC how vaccinated parents with unvaccinated children under 12 should be acting in order to protect their children. An asymptomatic Delta infection in a vaccinated adult could be a time bomb to a small child, especially if that child is immune compromised in any way. Why aren't we talking about this?"

How can this be surprising? The very same people who broadly discount the need for vaccination - and in some cases simply deny that the pandemic is real or that vaccines are necessary - are EXACTLY the people who will not wear a mask or practice any other safety measure. So, our general safety depends on responsible behavior from the most irresponsible members of the population. And how is that working out?"

I’m over 65, had the J&J and uninterested in finding out if I’d have a mild, moderate or severe case. The state of Maryland did a very good job of contact tracing."

I simply do not trust other fully vaccinated people who are not wearing masks to be taking the proper precautions and I certainly do not trust people who refuse vaccination to take any of the other precautions to avoid infection or to own up to their negligent behavior. 

I've noticed an increasing number of people, who I know to be vaccinated, taking similar precautions and continuing to mask. 
I have also not encountered anyone who has called me on my mask wearing.  

So I simply suggest that even if you are fully vaccinated and otherwise healthy you should consider continuing to wear a mask until this pandemic is fully under control, no matter how long that takes.  Its a bit of prudent practice that can help speed ending this pandemic.  If you are not vaccinated, please get vaccinated at your earliest opportunity.  It is your duty to your fellow human beings."

This is an inaccurate statement. Fully vaccinated people can clearly spread COVID to others. Please see this letter to the New England Journal of Medicine from last month regarding household transmission in the UK.

The upshot is that vaccinated people who contract COVID are only about 40-50% less likely than people who are unvaccinated to spread COVID to other members of the household.  That's still a lot of transmission. And this data likely comes from before Delta was widespread there.

In this ID doctor's opinion, it is well past time for the CDC to change its guidance and recommend universal masking indoors, regardless of vaccination status. This was a misguided recommendation to begin with and is leading to needless confusion and spread of the virus. Wearing a mask is just not that big of a deal."

 I find it hard to believe there isn't at least one person at the CDC compiling this information. Sounds like a plausible deniability situation to me.

It's time for health officials to stop referring to these infections as ""rare"" because they clearly are not. There's lots of anecdotal information from credible, publicly identified people like the biologist in this report that show otherwise.  

They also need to be upfront about what ""mild"" infection in the vaccinated actually means. It can be much more than a case of the sniffles as many people assume. It's been said from the very beginning that mild Covid can be a miserable experience with possible long-term effects and should not be taken lightly, even by the vaccinated.

The CDC's goal has always been to keep bodies out of the ICU and the morgue. The vaccine so far is successful. What they need to do now is be honest about the possible consequences to the vaccinated of trying to their pre-Covid life,  maskless and worry free, when there can be consequences that people may not want to pay. Then everyone can decide their own tolerance for risk."

When the vaccines were developed, in record time and with much higher efficacy than officials expected, we were thrilled. Pharma people explained that their vaccines were 90-94% effective on the variants they were tested on, and that the efficacy was even better for keeping people out of the hospital. Great news.

Fast forward to today, when people seem to be in a panic. Covid has mutated to a certain extent. The delta variant is some 50% more transmitable than the old variant, although it seems to not be any more lethal. That is bad news for those that have not gotten vaccinated. For someone who is, it seems that the efficacy is a bit less than with the original variant (somewhat bad news) but that the vaccines’ ability to keep you out of the hospital has not diminished (very good news).

The question for the future is what will happen to any new potential mutations. Will one come out that reduces the vaccines efficacy substantially, or will it be considerably more lethal? Either alternative suggests that we need the pharma companies to continue doing research to develop improved versions."
2021-07-22 20:30:04,"Yes, the unvaccinated are annoying. But equally annoying is this administration which declared no masks necessary for the vaccinated even as the delta variant was spreading rapidly among the vaccinated in India.

Does this administration think we are immune to what's happening in other countries? Declare masks necessary again and save lives."
2021-07-22 20:34:34,"My dog attends a doggie day play group occasionally.   I don’t know the owners of the other dogs but we all must bring documentation attesting to certain vaccinations.   So far he has come home healthy and safe from his play dates and we all know how dogs interact in personal ways.

I realize the simple answer is dogs have less rights, but in this case, the outcome seems better for them than for us humans, particularly children whose parents are anti vaxxers."
2021-07-22 20:36:09,"I tested positive for Covid in early January. I am since fully immunized,  but I am long haul Covid.. I have ‘flares’ of symptoms, which I treat symtomatically or ignore because hey, nobody really knows what to do and it ususally only lasts 2 weeks.  But this has me worried. How will I be able to tell if I am having a flare or breakthrough Covid and am infectious? It seems like this just never ends."
2021-07-22 20:37:53,In FL I know of numerous cases in vaccinated people. It seems like this is being kept quiet.
2021-07-22 20:40:20,"What exactly are these ""mild"" symptoms?"
2021-07-22 20:41:05,"I agree that Vaccines should be mandatory. I remember being vaccinated against the Hong Kong Flu in grammar school - 1968 or 1969- they just lined all of us school children up and vaccinated the whole class- I'm not even sure parents were asked for permission or not. From what I read the Hong Kong Flu was just as bad as Covid. By now- everybody should know the inner workings of Covid and the consequences of not being vaccinated. These break through cases are alarming and - for me - I postponed my ""Opening Date"" (life returning back to normal) first until July 15, and now I moved it back until December 15- no travel, no theater, no meeting with friends, no indoor dining-  only going out for essential food or medical care. It's hard and it's lonely, but I want to survive past Covid."
2021-07-22 20:43:39,"A lot of blame goes to CDC director Rochelle Walensky. She thought her little chart to show what vaccinated people can do without masks would incentivize others to get the shot. Just the opposite. The incentive to get vaccinated is to protect yourself and others against severe disease. Universally we should all be wearing masks indoors or in crowds until we can get more vaccinated. You can’t divide the room. The CDC remains obstinate, silencing others not to talk about this issue. It’s infuriating."
2021-07-22 20:44:10,"Is there a commonality of identifiable characteristics across the breakthrough group like age, immunological insufficiency, vaccine, etc. that might further ascribe risk; especially within the subgroup of hospitalized severe and fatal disease occurrences? 

When and by what criteria will the C.D.C., inevitably, call for more defensive measures like all masking requirements, contact tracing, multi-variant booster shots, national border quarantine, etc.? 
(As long as this remains a global pandemic, the virus variants will eventually mutate into a threat that surpasses the immunities achieved in first world countries.)

What is the actual weekly vaccination rate that qualifies as “stalling”?

What can government do now to better protect us? 

“Why Vaccinated People Are Getting ‘Breakthrough’ Infections” biologically within an individual?"
2021-07-22 20:44:20,A situation is developing where it will be ‘Vaxed vs UnVaxed’. Classic Darwinism.
2021-07-22 20:44:53,vaccinated or not everyone should still be wearing a mask!
2021-07-22 20:44:58,Boosters should be made accessible to high risk individuals and frontline workers in daily contact with the public. There seems to be a fair amount of minimizing of the very real threat of Delta and how well it can overwhelm antibody protection. I don’t know why the CDC seems to be stonewalling on boosters while maintaining such a laissez faire attitude on precautions such as masking and ventilation as cases keep going up.
2021-07-22 20:52:43,"The influenza vaccine like the COVID19 vaccine is not 100%.  There are breakthrough infections even with the annual influenza vaccine.

Working in the hospital - if I neglected proper PPE and hand hygiene - after seeing multiple patients with viral influenza, I would often develop a mild viral cold - despite receiving the influenza vaccine.  Proper use of PPE (your mask should never hang below your nose) and hand hygiene prevented further infections.  I suspect it will be a comparable situation with SARS-COV-2, as it would be for many viral respiratory infections. 

The key pathological difference between viral influenza pneumonia vs SARS-COV-2 pneumonia is the development of blood clots.  So get vaccinated people! 

For those who refuse to get vaccinated (influenza and covid19) keep this in mind: Influenza viral pneumonia can predispose one to developing a staph aureus (that’s a bacteria) necrotizing pneumonia, which means a hospital admission, a chest tube (inserted into your lung) to drain out pus and blood and IV antibiotics.  A scenario involving a superimposed sars-cov-2 infection, in an unvaccinated patient, will likely be an ICU admission."
2021-07-22 20:52:55,"This is a good and timely article, especially this line:
""Still, vaccinated people can come down with infections, overwhelmingly asymptomatic or mild. That may come as a surprise to many vaccinated Americans, who often assume that they are completely shielded from the virus.""

I've gotten a flu vaccination every year but one since 1983.  I got the flu almost every year since 1983--perhaps avoiding it completely during just 3 or 4 years. What I didn't get was very sick with the flu during any of those years since 1983.  

I was certainly much less ill with the flu than the college students I taught, most of whom would not get vaccinated.

Cellular immunity can only affect viruses after they enter the body.  Immunized people, for a while after virus exposure will grow some virus in ways and with results described in this article, unless and until antibodies wipe them out. The most assured way to have antibodies ready for the wipe-out is to get vaccinated. 

I am vaccinated against Covid and glad of it.  I will get a Covid vaccine booster if the knowledge of experience over time advises it. I expect I will have a few days of ""Covid 19-like symptoms"" based on my experience with flu vaccinations.  So, I will wear a mask in stores and crowded places so I don't spread to anyone else and for my own benefit.  This is not a big deal considering the alternative to not taking preventative actions.   None of this rates a level of difficulty of stupid dog tricks."
2021-07-22 20:59:41,"Isn’t the more serious issue that as the virus was passages through vaccinated people, it will have pressure to mutate to avoid the immune response provoked by the vaccine?"
2021-07-22 20:59:48,"An incomplete job is worse than no job at all.

The rush to “return to normal” with an “Operation Warp Speed” mentality only served to bolster false confidence for the vaccinated and no confidence for the unvaccinated.

Now we have variants impacting primarily the unvaccinated with questions arising about the need for boosters for the vaccinated as some vaccinated people are reportedly becoming sickened.

The fall months are approaching. Let’s remember last years surge so that our short memories don’t fail us."
2021-07-22 21:01:15,"People taking immuno-suppressant medicines were excluded from vaccine effectiveness testing. Most such people receive little or no lasting immunity from vaccines and may have zero antibodies. Masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds and enclosed places is prudent for this population."
2021-07-22 21:02:34,Just a thought but we do not know how long the vaccination is really effective for. If vaccines have been available since January 2021 is it safe to say that some of the breakthrough may be due to a wearing off of antibodies. I’m no scientist but would love if new data comes about in regards to how long the vaccines can protect us.
2021-07-22 21:06:46,"Okay, the question is, when SHOULD we stop wearing masks? Never?"
2021-07-22 21:06:53,"What my household changed after adults got vaccinated:

1) Allowed our (vaccinated) childcare to return, so I could go back to work (that I do from home)
2) Allowed vaccinated grandparents to visit, one at a time
3) Went to the dentist for the first time since the pandemic
4) I'm considering allowing a plumber to come in to fix a faucet we've not been able to use for eight months, but I'm still not convinced we can't wait

We do not go in any shops or restaurants, and we still wear masks outside and avoid crowds.

This will continue at least until our kids can be vaccinated.

Vaccines are not a free pass, especially with the disappointing rates and Delta variant."
2021-07-22 21:08:50,"As soon asI was eligible to get vaccinated this Spring, I did.  And set up vaccination appointments for my husbands having to drive 2hrs north to get these, because here in Europe we’d had delivery problems of the vaccines.  So, we’re both fully vaccinated since April. 

Since then, we never stopped wearing masks outside our home. Delta has arrived here too. Many got fed up with wearing masks. As restrictions were eased, masks weren’t required outdoors. And people plan their vacations and tra la la 🎶.￼

France is now having huge upticks in Covid. New restrictions have come forth: you want to go to an amusement park, cinema, museum etc? Show your QR passport uploaded onto your cell phone, or a paper printout of your vaccination, or very recent negative test. Or be refused entry. 

This came about last week. About five million people thereupon made vaccination appointments. Repression works."
2021-07-22 21:12:13,"The solution to the pandemic is vaccination not requiring the vaccinated to wear masks. Masking is just a half measure. I am vaccinated and am reassured that if I am infected it will not be too serious. I might actually welcome infection as equivalent to a booster shot, reminding my immune system what to look for and increasing its defenses against the virus. I will gladly wear a mask if I am around the elderly or immunocompromised but I see no reason to take any actions to protect those benighted individuals who refuse to take the precaution of vaccination to protect themselves."
2021-07-22 21:14:28,"It does seem that the CDC is playing down the severity of break-through infections, particularly in vaccinated elderly and vaccinated immunocompromised people, considering that anecdotal information coming from hospitals in Missouri says otherwise. The problem is that CDC is in a terrible spot of trying to get as many people vaccinated as possible, while not giving anti-vaxxers any more reasons, fake or otherwise, not to. The tightrope the CDC is walking to try to contain and control the messaging in favor of vaccinations is a hair's width. 

I have family members who have yet to get vaccinated, and I'm at the point of burning bridges to try to convince them to do it. One unvaccinated member works in retail and lives with my 76yr old vaccinated father. Another is 18 and lives with his vaccinated immunocompromised mother. 

For a minute there, there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and now the rates where those family members live are starting to spike along with my blood pressure and anxiety."
2021-07-22 21:16:20,"A lot of people are desperate for information that is not in here - what are reasonable precautions for vaccinated people who live with children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who are immunocompromised? Please, please cover this."
2021-07-22 21:16:50,"I had serious doubts about the wisdom of our state's reopening, so our family's lifestyle hasn't changed materially. Unfortunately, it seems those doubts were well-founded, thanks almost entirely to irrationality of the unvaccinated. Meanwhile, my employer remains fixated on dragging everyone into the office next month, and is also harping over and over again on the low risk for the vaccinated, but at the same time refuses to require proof of vaccination for entry. 

I do understand that I'm unlikely to get a severe case if I do get it - and driving a car may well be more dangerous - but the problem is my kids under 12 who have no protection if the unlikely happens. And yes, kids are likely to have less severe symptoms. But after doing everything ""right"" for the last 18 months, it just doesn't seem logical to take that risk right now. Hoping for progress over the next month but once again, a bit skeptical I'll see it."
2021-07-22 21:16:56,"I am having the most interesting experience.  Since the 4th of July, I have been approached several times by complete, unmasked strangers that felt the urgent need to let me know that I no longer need to wear a mask.

To these ""helpful"" people:  Yes, I do know I am wearing a mask.  Yes, I know that Minnesota no longer has a mask mandate.  Yes, I am choosing to wear a mask.  I am unsure why my choice to wear a mask (the mask is a plain one - no words or symbols) is of such concern to you.  I am not asking why you chose to not wear a mask; why is my choice to wear a mask an issue for you?"
2021-07-22 21:17:21,"I got my 2nd Pfizer April 4th by April 6th I started to feel like I had contracted a cold I had  a weird heavy cough, finally I lost all my taste and smell. I am lucky my case was mild considering that  only the 1st shot had kicked into my system. I shudder to think how that could have been different in 2020, it has been months and I still don't have the same sense of taste and smell. I cannot fathom why anyone would play Russian roulette with their lives, if there is a booster shot needed I won't hesitate it beats a slow death on a ventilator."
2021-07-22 21:18:49,I wish we had more information on vaccinated people over 65 who have become infected. I am wrestling with going on a week-long social outing with about 90 people whom I don't know but expect most will be vaccinated.  I will also be in very close quarters with three of my elderly friends (who will also be on this outing) who are vaccinated. The information that an infection will not be severe is less than comforting because I am 79.  I am seriously considering restricting our activities to me and my vaccinated friends and abandoning the social function. Although the decision is mine I would welcome any comments.
2021-07-22 21:19:17,"An excellent statistic divided out into age groups, clinical severity, duration of hospital stays and mortality rates would be to compare 5 groups:
1. Unvaccinated patients + COVID19 
2. Partially immunized patients + COVID19 
3. Fully immunized patients + COVID19 
4. 1st dose but < 14 days post injection + COVID19
5. 2nd dose but < 14 days post injection  + COVID19
6. Those completely devoid of any vaccine."
2021-07-22 21:20:35,"""It's disappointing they’re not tracking all breakthrough cases. But it’s worth noting that the CDC isn’t the only option: the NIH, academic medical centers, state and regional health departments, private companies, and a variety of grant funders, as well as researchers in other countries, can decide to support efforts to track breakthrough cases.

In days, weeks, or even months to come, it’s possible the CDC will reverse its decision and resume tracking all breakthrough cases. Regardless of how we shine a light on all breakthrough cases, it would seem wise to pay more, not less, attention to them.""

2021-07-22 21:23:25,"When there aren't many people out and about on the streets, I'm comfortable going unmasked.  Yesterday late afternoon in Soho I was surprised at the volume of maskless shoppers still out and about.  It felt virtually pre-Covid.  

It was enough of a change that I masked up just walking to the subway -- and that was a first.  If this keeps up it won't be the last."
2021-07-22 21:25:01,We will not be able to mask or vaccinate our way out of this.
2021-07-22 21:25:46,"Don't want to risk dying or being hospitalized and possibly intubated as a result of Covid?  Get the vaccine.  Want to reduce the risk of spreading Covid to others, who could possibly die from it?  Get the vaccine.  Don't even want to risk being sick at home for some amount of time if you get exposed to the virus?  In addition to getting vaccinated, also consider wearing a mask when around the general public."
2021-07-22 21:27:42,"It is the sad truth. I know a family of five who all just came down with a nasty bit of Covid, despite all being vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna. They just visited Florida, and were all under the weather for more than a week once returning. This is one of many stories I have heard within two degrees of separate.

I must admit I too thought of the vaccine as a ""golden shield"" against the virus until recent days. It saddens me to think that we will likely be masking back up soon, and mostly with the anti-vaxxers to blame. I fear for the safety of my immunocompromised family once again."
2021-07-22 21:28:18,"The State of Virginia reports COVID breakthroughs, url below. The vaccine success rate is enormously better than actual experience to date nationwide, which includes all deaths and cases to date, vaxxed or not. 
VA reports breakthrough infections among their 4,514,468 vaccinated citizens as of July 9, 2021. 
•	99.4% of breakthrough cases were people not fully vaccinated.
•	99.03% of deaths among breakthrough cases were in people not fully vaccinated.
•	1,157 breakthroughs occurred in 4,514,468 vaccinated people. The rate of vaccine failure (breakthrough) would be therefore 0.0256%. 
o	If we applied this rate of disease to our population, we would have had 85,472 total cases instead of 35,146,176. 
•	18 deaths occurred within the vaccinated group of 4,514,468. 
o	18 deaths translates to 
	one in 250,804 vaccinees, or 
	3.99 per million. 
o	Compare to US actual: 
	the US population (est) 333,500,000; deaths 625,862:
	Actual US death toll: one death in 532 or
	Actual US death toll: 1,878 per million 
•	if we applied Virginia’s vaxxed death rate of 3.99 per million, the death toll today would be 1,329 instead of 625,862. 
•	These vaccines are far more effective than flu vaccines, which are about 60% effective in a good year.

Public Health England is reporting vaccine effectiveness of one or more vaccines at about 80% (two doses). Not yet clear that Delta is more deadly."
2021-07-22 21:28:49,"So!  The truth begins to leak out.  The delta variant is associated with 1,000X higher viral loads.  And that is overwhelming the vaccine effects.  I thought so.

Viral load also explains the higher death rates in Black and Hispanic patients.  Their typically multi-generational and multi-family living arrangements, compressed work environments, and refusal to wear masks contribute to increased viral load.

The truth begins to leak out."
2021-07-22 21:41:50,"Vaccines are a best educated guess at any point in time. The annual flu vaccines have generally been a good match (in all but three of the 19 years before 2007, for example) with the stains circulating. And this efficacy may improve should the mRNA-derived vaccine now just entering clinical trials prove out.  COVID-19 vaccines likewise have turned out to be on target in preventing hospitalization and death, the essential goal of vaccination. But let us never forget that we're up against a wily, opportunistic opponent who likes nothing better than to lie in wait for us to drop our guard."
2021-07-22 21:42:18,"In my opinion, the CDC needs to move on from ""no masks if you are vaccinated.""  Clearly it is possible to become ill if you are vaccinated, and it is not such a burden to wear a mask indoors while amongst strangers.  I just do not understand why they won't budge.  It clearly isn't increasing vaccination rates.  In fact, it is probably doing the opposite.  Recommend this and work with state governments, large employers, teacher's unions, etc.  Perhaps the message could be that masks are needed until X% of all people are vaccinated."
2021-07-22 21:44:03,"Even if the cases are mild or asymptomatic, breakthrough infections increase the risk of worse variants developing.  The more a virus replicates, and spreads, the more chances it gets to mutate into a dangerous variant.  Everyone should continue wearing masks indoors at the very least."
2021-07-22 19:36:38,"Biden is watching now the opening of Hell on earth.  Trump stood there a year and half ago and decided to do nothing.  Biden should act or face another Covid-19 pandemic killing people all over.  Enough evidence shows that Covid-19 is re-emerging as major disaster and time to act is YESTERDAY!!!  I said this before in Trump time, and many ridiculed my warnings.  I will say it again, and hope that someone out there is listening about this grave threat that is already spreading.  

Biden should be different."
2021-07-22 20:40:48,Wait!  Joe Biden told me last night at his Town Hall Meeting that you couldn't get COVID if you got the vaccine.

2021-07-22 20:23:33,The level of the stupidity in this country is absolutely horrifying. I am staying the heck out of restaurants and wearing a mask every time I go to the grocery for the foreseeable future even though I am vaccinated.
2021-07-22 19:32:39,"It's astounding to me that people aren't getting  the vaccine. I work in the medical industry, so I was vaccinated back in January. Even still, I have coworkers who refused to get it. I have one coworker who got the vaccine, but his family didn't, and just yesterday, his wife and son tested positive. He's acting like it's no big deal, saying things like, ""they just have a few cold symptoms, it's fine,"" as if he's trying to drive home the misinformation he was fed that covid is no worse than a cold. I really hope his family is okay, but when you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes."
2021-07-22 19:37:44,"After reading the article (see paragraph below) - why does the NYT think this story deserves ""front page"" treatment?.

""But as worrying as the trend may seem, breakthrough infections — those occurring in vaccinated people — are still relatively uncommon, experts said, and those that cause serious illness, hospitalization or death even more so. More than 97 percent of people hospitalized for Covid-19 are unvaccinated"""

2021-07-22 21:05:38,"It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye.

Our society making a true and well comeback is quite literally being held hostage by a minority of anti-science self-centered idiots.

People who are eligible for the vax yet refuse to do so should be back of the line for care, prohibited from visiting restaurants, bars, mass transit, sports events, movies, and any/all other public accommodation.

We're well past the time for entertaining these Typhoid Mary scocipaths."
2021-07-22 21:13:53,"I don't mean to be religious here but perhaps the COVID-19 virus and its variants is God's punishment to humanity. Come to think of it humans have done countless terrible thing to each other (e.g., divisiveness, greed, lies, racial injustice, deception, murder, etc.) and to the world for the past century. Science and human's medical knowledge have its own limits."
2021-07-22 20:35:15,"""More than 97 percent of people hospitalized for Covid-19 are unvaccinated.""
---------
This is a prime example of MSM fearmongering.  Without knowing how many have come down with Covid and how many of those were hospitalized, 97% is a meaningless number used simply to scare people.

I live in CA.  My county has a population of ~800k.  We have a grand total (accurate as of 7/21) of only 15 people (that's FIFTEEN) in the hospital with Covid.  Out of ~800k!

Using the 97% number against those hospitalized, that would mean that 14 of those 15 hospitalized souls were likely unvaccinated.  So?  

The number of actual unvaccinated here (including myself) is likely greater than 100k.  With the number of seriously sick unvaccinated people in the hospital at a very low count of 14, 97% is a meaningless and useless number for comparisons sake, as the vast majority of unvaccinated people are not sick nor in the hospital.

I expect better from the NYT!"
2021-07-22 20:58:52,"They didn't post my other comment, perhaps too direct. Basically, it said, get the vaccine and get it now. This mess is only going to get worse, much worse!"
2021-07-22 20:44:44,"Dr Celine Gounder lies. She cannot say no breakthrough cases can result in death. That's just false. It may be uncommon, but it can and has happened! And there's the question of a booster for Pfizer recipients. Everyone should get vaccinated, but still wear a mask indoors. Be safe."
2021-07-22 21:49:28,"This is MADDENING. When I was extremely sick in late June/early July, and was tested for COVID19, the woman who performed the test told me they are NOT TRACKING breakthrough cases unless they result in persons being hospitalized or dying. They had no information for me about probabilities, nor about whether vaccinated people who contract COVID19 can transmit it. I have seen no position changes from CDC since, so how do “experts” know that breakthrough cases are exceedingly rare?"
2021-07-22 21:50:44,"They test positive on a very sensitive test.  The real question how many of those are real and more importantly how many evolve into something with mild symptoms.  I would love to know how many are just transitory infections quickly dismissed. Remember the test is very sensitive.

If you are vaccinated is ones virus load enough to infect?

We do know vaccinated people when they get cases they are rarely dangerous.  It is the unvaccinated that are the true source of this fourth wave. Compared states with high rates against those with low rates."
2021-07-22 21:50:47,"Why is everybody so anti masking? It is not hard, it is not that uncomfortable (and I live in the land of 110 degree days for 6 months of the year), and it is effective to combat Covid.  WHY is everybody so eager to stop wearing them? 
I am vaccinated but also am wearing my mask at work and in public. 
I just don't understand it.  I see way more women wearing masks though.  Maybe it is because we have been conditioned since birth to be uncomfortable, wearing bras, wearing tight clothes, wearing high heels, no pockets, uncomfortable dresses, and all that comes with being a typical woman."

I had 2 of the Moderna and I have tested negative several times. 
Pfizer is hiding something about their vaccine. 
I want their company to come clean about why so many Pfizer vaccinations have become infected. 
The Israeli Study seems valid. 
Moderna appears to defend against Delta much better. 
What is the deal? What’s going on here? 
Give everyone a third shot. Now. 
We can’t wait for boosters. Mutations are happening now due to the unvaccinated fools. 
Third shots."
2021-07-22 21:53:17,"It’s scandalous that the CDC isn’t gathering statistics on ‘breakthrough’ Covid infection and doing such things as looking for correlations with the varieties of shots people received (as a former federal employee, I know how chary agencies are about reporting statistics on the quality of products, but…).  There’s no telling, in advance, what science might grow out of such statistical studies."

2021-07-22 22:07:54,"I don't understand why ""guidance"" is needed to wear masks. For most it is a simple thing to do, causes minimum inconvenience and cuts risk significantly. Even if the vaccine is 80% effective, coupled with a mask that is 80% effective as well the chance of an infection drops to 4% from 20%. Defense in depth is a well known idea. Two layers of defense are much bteer than one."

Regarding Provincetown, another virus has been problematic there for years. Those continuing infection rates, after forty years, and the development of remarkable pharmaceuticals, are, or should be, a scandal.

Does the same advice hold true for those with pre-existing conditions or the elderly who experience ""breakthrough"" infections?  Provincetown, MA officials reported most of those who contracted breakthrough infections there have been males aged 25-35. When medical authorities assure us the vaccines are working because those who get breakthrough infections almost never are hospitalized or die, does this apply to those with pre-existing conditions and the elderly?"

Third-grade math: roughly 100-94=6% (1 of 16) of the vaccinated will get infected. NOT ZERO PERCENT. Yes, it’s critical that the 6% are highly unlikely (NOT “100% unlikely”) to be hospitalized; and, the info on transmissibility is very important. But this reporter, and the editor(s) who let this simple but essential and highly obvious point pass until the very last sentence (too late), are feeding the conspiracy theory beast and the widespread misperception that full vaccination means full freedom. As a sixth-grade teacher, I’m appalled - and offer my (and other teachers’) services to help y’all understand how to explain things to people. It’s my/our job, and I/we take it seriously."

The risk of a vaccinated person dying of COVID is infinitesimal in the scheme of things. Nothing in life is zero-risk, and most of what humans engage in is far riskier! Driving a car, for example.

A dozen countries are now mandating vaccination for some or all of their citizens. Experts are concerned that C-19 viral mutations are evolving more rapidly than humans can create effective treatments or vaccines, and that the world is at the tipping point for an uncontrolled, increasingly lethal contagion.

The delta variant is twice as contagious as the original strain and now accounts for 83% of new COVID cases in the US, which have increased by over 195% (tripled) in the last two weeks. On July 16, 2021, infectious disease physician Catherine O'Neal, MD stated ""We are either going to get vaccinated and end the pandemic, or we're going to accept death and a lot of it,"" echoing the sentiments of Swedish COVID expert Marcus Carlsson, who has said ""Vaccination roll-out must continue with high participation.”  

The unvaccinated population in the US is a de facto host environment where COVID-19 is free to reproduce/mutate into increasingly aggressive strains. 

It’s likely that a variant with lethality of 10% will emerge, interfering with the supply chain for critical commodities . At that point, government officials will have no choice but to impose stricter safety protocols & possibly mandatory vaccination.

Given that no vaccine in history is 100% effective, the only thing that we learn from the proportion of cases that are in previously vaccinated people is that the vaccine in question is not 100% effective, like every vaccine ever used. . So, as a higher proportion of the population is vaccinated, it is hardly surprising that a growing proportion fo the cases will be in previously vaccinated individuals.

That's what yoou're seeing. Getting vaxed in January for a rhino viuse is like having your flu shot 2-4 years ago and hoping it applies now.  We should have kept masked on to lessen the spread so it woudln't learn to get around the vaccine as fast. and oh yes, we will need boosters. We need them right now.

I’m frustrated that we are considering this option.

That being said, yes, I’m also frustrated that anti-vaxxers are using this as ammo to say that vaccines don’t work. They do work! You are far, far less likely to even get Covid or spread it if you’ve been fully vaccinated, and even if you do contract Covid, the symptoms will be much less noticeable and more mild. I just wish that this could stop being such an absurd political issue. IMO, too many influential speakers are putting out false information that people readily believe.

2021-07-22 23:25:09,"Because I take Fauci and other health officials at their word, I do not worry about getting COVID (which is a set of symptoms, not a positive result on a lab test). 

The chances of me, a vaccinated person, having a serious case, even as serious as the one I had when I actually did contract the virus last March, are vanishingly rare. I'm about 100 times more likely to die in a car wreck, and about 50 times more likely to be hospitalized by the flu in an average flu season. 

I could choose to worry about my very, very, very small chances of a serious case, or of spreading the disease now that I'm vaccinated, but if I did, it wouldn't make sense to get in cars EVER, or really to do anything else ever, because the likelihood of getting or giving a serious case of Covid is now much smaller than other threats. 

I could, likewise, choose to ignore Fauci when he says that the results show that vaccinated people overwhelmingly do not get sick or transmit the virus, and keep worrying, but then I'd have to ignore everything else he said, which wouldn't make a lot of sense. 

About 1/1,000,000 vaccinated people will die of COVID. I personally can't relate to worrying about that statistic,"

SARS-CoV-2 is adapting to survive but are we?  Our (human) survival is in world-wide  vaccination, sooner rather than later.  The longer the delay, the greater the chance we will get the omega variant.  Omega is the last mutant variant we identify and record before we are killed off as a species.  The omega variant is  the delta variant with the ability to spread to others from a vaccinated individual.

Fortunately we are seeing nowhere near this many, predominantly because if a breakthrough occurs, it is usually asymptomatic or extremely mild. Odds are one won't even know they had the disease. The vaccine doesn't just prevent cases, it drastically mitigates the course of the disease if you do contract it. The number of severe cases in vaccinated people is fantastically small, something to be celebrated.

That those asymptomatic breakthrough cases *might* be able to pass on the disease is another, probably more worrisome aspect.  Of course the solution is at hand - if you aren't yet vaccinated, get one now!"
2021-07-22 23:33:22,"i live in l.a. and, regardless of cdc or state or county recommendations, i always have been wearing a mask when walking on city streets, in stores and in malls. one does not need to be a doctor to see that there are way too many people unvaccinated out there, so why take a stupidly careless risk of going mask free just because you have received the vaccine? if the entire country was between 80% and 90% inoculated then we could rest easier."
2021-07-22 23:35:09,"That there is a surprise that people who are fully vaccinated still get the CORONAVIRUS may reflect professionals as well as lay people haven't come to terms with the reality, all people's immune systems are not the same. This more than ""immune compromised"" individuals. This is an individualization of the immune response people have to all sorts of intrusions from outside as well inside. Cancer in part represents a failure of the body to identify and remove  cells  that are potentially cancerous. A bacterial infection can follow a viral infection whereby the virus has temporarily suppressed the body's immune system. Same thing happens after a sever sunburn and the person develops ""cold sores"" 4 days later. The virus, usually herpes simplex, residing in the facial nerves ganglions will travel down the nerves to the lips and cause blisters because the body's immune system has been temporarily suppressed. Days later, when the immune system is fully restored, the virus travels back to the ganglion. It is no surprise nor should it be that fully vaccinated people are vulnerable to infection either because of opportunistic issues like cold sores, or because their immune system is sluggish to respond. We humans are really all different in so many ways, why would the immune system be any different?"
2021-07-22 23:24:48,"Let's be clear. The vaccinated are still protected against the worst consequences of the Delta variant. But the unvaccinated, aside from risking their own health and lives, are creating a substantial population pool within which an even more vaccine-resistant variant might yet develop. We badly need full FDA approval for the vaccines so employers nationwide have no hesitation requiring vaccination of all employees in the workplace. That's about the only way we're going to get quickly closer to herd immunity. This pussy-footing around illusory notions of ""personal freedom,"" to which we pay no attention when it comes to seat belts and drunk driving, has killed many Americans and has the potential to kill even more, as well as shutdown the economy again. Time is not on our side."
2021-07-22 23:32:41,"Would some PLEASE tell me if there is a correlation between the vaccinated people who get infected, and whihc vaccine they received?  Please?  Dr. Fauci?  NYT reporters?   Anyone?"
2021-07-22 23:45:33,"They never said the vaccines were 100% effective.  They are only 95% effective, which means 5 people out of every 100 vaccinated were never protected.  Did FOX news submit this story to the NY Times?"
2021-07-22 23:51:02,"It is possible that the effectiveness of the vaccines is significantly decreasing over time, particularly against the delta variant. We may be seeing some evidence of that now, as it would appear, at least anecdotally, that the number of breakthrough infections has increased significantly, compared even to a month ago. Until May 1 the CDC was publishing the data it was tracking on breakthrough infections, but after May 1 it stopped. Now they only publish the data on hospitalizations and deaths among the fully vaccinated, and those numbers indeed remain very low. Still, if the vaccines are now providing diminished protection against breakthrough infections, the CDC should make this information public and should accelerate the development of the booster shots."
2021-07-22 23:52:41,Why are there breakthrough cases of Covid. The unvaccinated are the issue. It blew my mind when I watched the evening news earlier and saw a demonstration by hospital staff at New York Presbyterian who were objecting to a new mandatory vaccination policy. How can those who are vaccinated feel safe when medical personnel are refusing the vaccine?  This is ridiculous.
2021-07-22 23:53:10,Why do many people vaccinated for the annual influenza still become ill with that flu?

I am waiting for my transplant physician to give the go-ahead to get a third shot.  Since the mask mandates were lifted , I am basically back to square one, being sequestered and having my husband run all the errands. Thankfully, it's summer, and I can spend some time outside when the weather is decent. I don't know *what * I will do if I still have to be doing this in the winter.  I'll feel like a prisoner in my own home if I can't get out.
My husband still wears a mask *everywhere* when he runs errands; he even still wears one at work, even tho no one else does.  He doesn't want to bring the virus home.
I am terrified of a ""breakthrough"" infection. I'd be dead within a couple of weeks.  My aunt recently passed away, and I chose not to attend the funeral; my husband did, and according to him, no one masked up or social distanced. My husband recently flew out to Washington state to attend the funeral of his brother. I didn't go.  Same thing there.
There is very little awareness that though immuno-compromised people are only 3% of the population, we actually are everywhere. Very few of us don't know someone that is not.  
All I and my husband ask is for the general population to please think of others, to ""love your neighbor as much as you love yourself"". All it is really, is having good manners, being kind, gentle, patient. To understand that all of us are the same."

What an abdication of the CDC’s responsibility."
2021-07-23 00:10:26,"So the public messaging game, besides urging vaccination, is to lower expectations of the vaccines. Hmm. Well, it's good to try to be as clear and accurate as possible. Best to avoid crowd control tactics and stop managing feelings. Try to avoid resentful backlash.

New York has never ever really enforced mask mandates. Everything is a suggestion, nothing enforced, and the police still wear masks inconsistently at best. Will a new Mayor bring back respect for rules?

It is breathtaking how childishly people, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, have dropped their masks and forgot their cautions. No, let's not return to neurotic protocols either. But we are trending towards disaster, or at least extending this lovely pandemic for an extra year. Some don't care.  Some don't think.

Now that it appears that 3 million have died in India alone, is this really time to hold on to the illusion of American Exceptionalism?"

Quite a difference in an efficacy rate for the same inoculation.

2021-07-23 00:18:47,"I think reports concerning breakthrough infections fail to emphasize a simple fact.  Since just about half of the population is fully vaccinated, the number of vaccinated and not vaccinated people is about the same.  Yet, at the current time 97% percent of people hospitalized are unvaccinated. Then of course 3% of the people who are hospitalized are vaccinated. That means, if you are unvaccinated, you have 97/3 ~ 33 times larger chance to get hospitalized.  I am pretty sure that a similar ratio for people  dying of Covid-19 is even larger."
2021-07-23 00:24:37,"I guess we can thank the CDC's ridiculous, confusing, premature decision for :

- vaccinated people to throw off their masks, really?

- for non-vaccinated people to wear masks - really? 
Oh! yea....just like they wore masks NOT when there were all levels of government saying wear a mask.

What were they thinking ? 

 They are supposed to be scientists. 
YET,
If a lay person like me read about variants a very loooong  time ago during the beginning of the pandemic in 2020,  why didn't they envision the effects of a highly contagious Delta variant and more to come and realize that their ""throw away your masks "" if you are vaccinated.  Give me a break!  I envisioned it and I never threw away a mask .. I am double-vaxxed.  I bought more masks!"
2021-07-23 00:26:14,"Some of the overconfidence in the vaccines is simply that they were always reported to be less than 100% effective, but somehow people seem not to have kept that in mind.  Also, articles like this don't put the numbers in numerical context.  It says the CDC knows of 5,500 vaccinated people who were hospitalized or died, but we're not told how many unvaccinated people were hospitalized or died in the same time span.  More importantly, no mention is made of how many had immune system issues that interfere with the vaccine's effectiveness.  There is already published research showing methotrexate interferes, and it's taken by a lot of people in the US.  It would be good to report how many."

2021-07-23 00:34:44,"I think the tricky math is the medical community’s tendencies to cite high percentage efficacy, but since this disease is so contagious, it leads to frightening absolute numbers. Are we ok with hundreds of sub-11 year olds dying, even if that’s a negligible percentage? Are companies willing to bring back their employees if some vaccinated end up dying? Seems like we’re in a bit of a bind and herd immunity is not as close as we hoped."
2021-07-23 00:36:38,Thank you scientists of America for giving me the two Pfizer vaccines.  I felt it was our moral obligation to get it and patriotic.

All these cry baby GOP/Evangelicals who are refusing should not have hospital care as they are endangering the brave doctors and nurses again and their families.

2021-07-23 00:36:52,"I also agree with the concerns about long Covid. I still suffer from heart and lung trouble a year after having Covid. It's not a minor illness and it's premature to say that breakthrough infections are ""mild."" In my view, people should still mask up -- the CDC was premature both from a science perspective (the vaccines were not 100% effective and the virus was still raging) and a public health policy perspective in announcing vaccinated people should take off their masks."
2021-07-23 00:37:58,It’s not brain surgery or rocket science in determining why vaccinated people get break through cases. It’s because some people won’t get vaccinated.

For the vaccinated to wear masks is the purpose to prevent them from spreading the virus when they wear the surgical masks (or other home made non N95 masks)? Or are they supposed to wear an N95 mask?

The vaccine was the game changer but we as a country should never have given up on the other two components back in May. The unmasking and cutting back on testing in some states could prove to be costly. Dr. Walensky needs to be removed for a poor public health guidance two months ago."
2021-07-23 01:47:27,"There seems to be a lot more comments from the unvaccinated/“you’re sheep”/media fear mongering/“my freedoms are being trampled” crowd here. The irony is, that stance IS the cause of this new wave. For those that are using the argument of “Emergency Approval”= I’m not getting vaccine, that “fig leaf” will be snatched away very soon. Then you’ll all be naked….and afraid."
2021-07-23 02:18:49,"The sooner we realize that we are in endemic Covid, as opposed to epidemic Covid, the better we shall be able to manage expectations. Just like the 'flu, if people are not vaccinated, some will die, but if one has any sense of self-preservation, one ""gets a jab"". The larger outrage is of course that those without access of regular medical care or informed medical advice will suffer, but they do so already, not just with dangerous infections but with all aspects of their healthcare. This larger problem is unsolvable (insoluble) given the current political and civil society, so do not expect it to be solved as a result of Covid."
2021-07-23 02:19:03,"While this article states that it is ""relatively uncommon"" for vaccinated folks to get Covid; currently, I know of 6 fully vaccinated younger and older people in San Francisco and Seattle who have contracted Covid in the past 6 days. Considering the low Covid rates throughout the pandemic in both cities, this doesn't sound 'relatively uncommon' to me. None are asymptomatic. Perhaps the term ""relatively uncommon"" needs to be defined more clearly? And is data on these breakthrough infections in the U.S. actually being collected, submitted and responded to by the CDC?"
2021-07-23 02:19:36,"I continue to be very frustrated with the speed at which the CDC advised vaccinated people to unmask and reopenings.  

As physicians, they swore to first do no harm.  This means the likelihood of harm needs to be less than all other possible outcomes.  They failed this by not choosing the path which could result in the least amount of harm.  They advised unmasking before understanding the ferocity of variants, before seeing the level of vaccine hesitancy, and before gauging when the rest of the world can be vaccinated.  They in fact chose the path which could cause the most harm knowing they were lacking information on these crucially data points.  We are all paying the price, vaccinated and unvaccinated, for their hubris."
2021-07-23 02:25:04,"The CDC needs to change its mask guidance for the vaccinated ASAP preferably, at least, tying it to the amount if people vaccinated in an area.  

(Itshouldn’t have been changed at all before especially since they knew that delta was here and breakthrough infections were occurring).

President Biden should be seriously considering replacing Dr. Walensky.  She made a huge error in judgment."
2021-07-23 02:25:57,"I think the US has lost its collective mind.

Our best shot (pun intended) is for everyone who can to get vaccinated. If you’ve had Covid, you may have sufficient natural immunity, or you may not, so at least one jab is preferable.

If you think you’ll become infertile, or get implanted with a chip, or suffer some mysterious “long term” effects that are somehow worse than the very real long term effects of Covid from the vaccine, then you need therapy and deprogramming.

If you’re vaccinated but not insane, wear a mask judiciously. Outdoor restaurant? Hiking? Probs fine. Grocery store? Movie? Plane flight? Airport? Bus station? Football game? Mask up.

Not vaccinated? Unmasked? Go boil your heid, as the Scots say.

The science is evolving. The antivaxxers are devolving. So we all just have to do the best we can and stop panicking about things we have no control over."
2021-07-23 02:28:32,"The speed of delta is astonishing. Here in Oklahoma, we’ve gone from 150 cases a day to over 1400 in three weeks, from 120 in the hospital to over 400, and a new horrid wrinkle, 26 children among them. And we’re small, not densely packed. It’s so fast people still aren’t masking except a few. But this variant is easy to get and give, and it doesn’t just go after older folks. By the time our governor reacts, it will be too late for many."
2021-07-23 02:29:32,I don't understand why the CDC and most people have to treat masks are an enemy. Isn't it true that vaccinated can still carry the virus albeit they don't show symptoms? Don't we still need to protect each other? I don't see how we can get through this together if we have two Americas.

2021-07-23 02:40:36,"It's very frustrating to read these articles and see that the type of vaccine is never mentioned. The vaccines are not the same. I somewhat assume the described cases are mostly referring to J&J-vaccinated folks, but... is that true? If people with one vaccine are contributing more to spread than others, we should know. Articles such as these are not nearly as helpful as they would be if the vaccine type was mentioned along with each story of infection."
2021-07-23 02:40:46,"It is very interesting that all the publicity of the ominous Delta variant became ubiquitous after Biden et al. had such a difficult time as vaccination rates plummeted. For months they tried to cajole, to scold, to punish, to chastise w/o success. And then, as Jonathan Schwartz of the old and wonderful WNEW FM used to say ""As if by wizardry""  we were bombarded with this dangerous and sudden burst of Delta. It manifested everywhere and the vaccination messages became even more throaty and pronounced. So fascinating- where is the tail and where is the dog? BTW, I'm full vaxxed."
2021-07-23 02:41:13,"In the country of Singapore in Southeast Asia, which has seen a small upsurge in cases in the last month, nearly 40% of cases are breakthrough cases, albeit mild. All of them are fully vaccinated with one of the two mRNA vaccines.  Granted, it's only about 400 cases of about 900 in all, but one hopes it is not a harbinger of the future for other countries, or a sign that there is yet another variant, that pierces through, and that, too, easily."
2021-07-23 02:41:36,"I agree that the best information possible should be disseminated, but if someone only reads the first couple of paragraphs of this article they would likely conclude vaccines are not useful. that is far from the truth as noted further in the article.

Which is more important - communicating that vaccines are very effective or that they are nor perfect?  Fox News is handling the latter, we count on the Times to do the former. Unfortunately, clicks seem to be taking precedent."
2021-07-23 02:42:26,"The CDC has been negligent in their lack of urgency and mild timid “recommendations.” But nothing will change in America unless children get sick, as if other humans don’t matter. Until we start seeing small children suffering from this virus, people will continue to be belligerently defiant about masking, vaccinating, and other pandemic protocols. Americans are a special brand of obtuse."

Unlike the Spanish Flu, we have biotech capability in becoming fully vaccinated yet there are the unvaccinated holding on to conspiracy theories.

2021-07-23 03:17:49,"I tested positive for Covid two weeks ago and I was fully vaccinated in March.  It started like a nasty head cold and the worst symptoms lasted for 10 days (headache, mild fever for 2 days, body aches, shakiness, loose stools, leg cramps, and worst of all fatigue and lethargy that are still lingering on day 15).

I am assuming that the vaccine helped a lot, and I do think everyone that can should get vaccinated. However,  I'm not going to condemn others who haven't been vaccinated.  Some people have legitimate reasons not to vaccinate, while others are just plain afraid.  We don't live in China. Americans still have the freedom to choose.

Our own CDC and the experts have issued conflicting and confusing recommendations at times.  We can't expect the public to feel total confidence in anyone's advice with a virus that is still new and still mutating and changing...."
2021-07-23 03:19:44,"There is a bright side here - for 11 and under covid is probably not more dangerous than the seasonal flu. For 12 and older we have a shot that will likely make your experience no worse than a bad flu. If you’re really concerned, nothing is stopping you from masking and avoiding crowds. UK data suggests another big death wave is unlikely. To me this seems favorable to the Australia/East Asia approach to perpetual lockdowns and restrictions."
2021-07-23 03:23:25,"The vaccines, especially the mRNA variety, are phenomenally effective -- somewhere around 94% if memory serves. And that means effective at preventing you from getting the virus.

At latest count there were just over 162,000,000 people fully vaccinated in the US. Even if the vaccines were 99% effective against infection, one percent would be 1.6 million. So why are people going crazy about a few ""breakthrough"" cases? They are to be expected. 

And, by the way, as we are constantly reminded, vaccinated people who do get infected suffer much less serious symptoms. A little bit of reasoning about ""breakthroughs"" -- and clear explanation by authorities -- would go a long way."
2021-07-23 03:28:54,"I had a break through about a month ago. Vaccinated in late January. It was a headache, runny nose and tired. Lasted two days. I am so grateful for the vaccines. If I was still working, I am retired, I would have gone to work. Isolated like our health department told me  and got a lot done in my gardens."
2021-07-23 03:35:34,"It seems foolish to quote a doctor early in this story saying the message to the vaccinated public should be:
“You are not going to end up with severe disease, hospitalization or death.”
when the CDC data show 160 deaths of vaccinated people as of April 30. Yes that’s just 2% of breakthrough infections, which are themselves rare. But rounding down to zero  seems like an infantilizing public health message that will do more to erode trust than it will to build it."
2021-07-23 03:39:32,"Math: The mRNA-based vaccines are around 95% effective. That means that even with the original coronavirus variant, about 1 vaccinated person caught covid for every 20 unvaccinated people who caught it. The newer coronavirus variants are more contagious, and may infect vaccinated people more frequently. This is why vaccinated people are getting 'breakthrough' infections. The only news story is how bad people are at understanding quantitative concepts."
2021-07-23 03:41:46,"Retired doctor here.

COVID is Russian roulette and every human has to play.  If you are not vaccinated, you're playing with one bullet in a revolver with maybe 100 chambers.  The odds are good, but since everyone has to play, quite a few folks will be very unlucky indeed.

If you are vaccinated, you are playing with one bullet in a revolver with a couple thousand chambers. Your chances are now very good,  but still some will be unlucky. 

But the practical question is this: 

Which game would you rather play?"

1. This is still a very dangerous virus. The more it circulates, the more dead or crippled Americans we end up with. Also, the better chance we get hit with a far more dangerous variant.

2. Your best protection is to get vaccinated, and help others to get vaccinated. Which vaccine ain’t that big a deal for public health. If you get vaccinated, there is far less chance that you will spread this, or die. 

3. Pretty much, you should ignore any fancy language or blab about math on these forums. It’s unnecessary, and it’s often dangerous bull. I would also skip most of the fancy “science;” same reason

4. I would recommend get vaccinated, and wearing a mask in crowds, and especially indoors. As with vaccines, it is not a guarantee. Just your best shot. 

5. I’d also ignore anybody who blats about all the complexities, and freedom, and so on. 

It’s simple. Get your shot, help others get theirs. Mask up some, wash yer hands.

The chances of you being struck by lightning in this given year are about 1/500,000. Over the course of an 80 year life, about 1/15,000. I'm willing to bet no one in this comments section would change their behavior based on that anecdote/statistic. 

But many people are on here are seeing someone post about having had a breakthrough infection and are seeing it as a reason to do things differently, or to keep wearing a mask/avoid crowds even after being vaccinated. The chances of being harmed by lightning are higher.

That's a stunning and revealing statistic on hospital-level breakthroughs, presented in today's CDC meeting.  The CDC took up the life-or-death issue of millions of immunocompromised Americans who, despite getting vaccinated, need more shots in order to ACTUALLY be vaccinated. I am one of those Americans.  (And by the way, although studies show necessity, safety and efficacy of additional doses for our demographic, and Israel and France are starting additional doses for those with weakened immune systems, the CDC still dithers!)

Was the above quote (re. 44% of hospitalized breakthroughs being in immunocompromised people) derived from the NYT's lead story, ""Why people are getting breakthrough infections""?  No. I had to go to CNBC to learn that.

This information is highly relevant to the topic: please cover it next time.  The non-immunocompromised may rest a little easier, the immunocompromised may take precautions and seek solutions, and we'll all be better informed."

At least I’m over the burning lungs, diverticulitis and visual disturbances and an occasional expensive trip to the ER to make sure I didn’t have blood clots. I don’t want even three days of that again, thank you. Why can’t we just wear masks for another few months while we wait for vax deniers to get with the program and get vaccinated? Is it so hard?

2021-07-23 05:41:15,"Breakthrough is a misnomer.  The covid vaccine prevents death from infection but not infection itself. It does this because the inoculation of a vaccinated person rapidly activates immune “memory” formed by the original vaccination, which allows a faster antiviral immune response to develop that limits spread within the body.  I’m not sure I understand how an unrestricted infection induces the blood clots that are killing so many unvaccinated people. But by restricting the spread of the infection, and engendering a more rapid immune response, the vaccine is saving lives in droves.  I haven’t seen any data or modeling on this, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see a more rapid spread of the delta variant as a silent asymptomatic infection amongst vaccinated people, especially as societal self isolation and vigilance is relaxed. If that happens the unvaccinated, the immunosuppressed, and children, will be increasingly vulnerable, will suffer increasingly more serious infections, and will die at higher rates. So mask up, and hope that unvaccinated people realize that the virus doesn’t care who they voted for, what the people on fox say to increase their ratings, or whether the government is to be trusted.  If delta comes for you, and you aren’t vaccinated, you and your kids could suffer chronic debilitating disease, you might just die. And there won’t be anywhere to hide."

But I worry that that stupid spike continues to evolve. I still haven’t heard anything very informative about the possibility of the spike evolving to circumvent the antibodies produced by the vaccines. If that happens, how many will die until we can update the mRNA platform and roll out an updated vaccine?"

For my breakthrough case, the symptoms did not warrant serious illness or hospitalization but they’re not merely mild. I had a fever, cough, congestion, loss of taste, fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Had I known that being fully vaccinated and “resuming activities I did before the pandemic without wearing a mask or physically distancing” (guideline taken from CDC) would’ve caused such miserable symptoms, I would not at all have followed government guidelines. I would’ve continued to socially distance and mask-up.

I got both doses of Moderna, my sister got both doses of Pfizer, and we both got so sick with a breakthrough infection. We’re young, healthy, with no pre-existing conditions and a strong immune system.

Everyone needs to play on the same team no matter what country you're living in - please get vaccinated.  And while covid keeps floating about in its variants, please continue to practice social distancing and wear a mask in situations where social distancing isn't possible.

Now we are getting documented chains of infection through vaccinated people. This will select for more vaccine escape. The Delta outbreak in Singapore proves that vaccinated still transmitted. In one Delta cluster alone, among 29 vaccinated who got infected, 21 transmissions events were between vaccinated-to-vaccinated or vaccinated-to-unvaccinated. Vaccinated people not wearing masks amidst the Delta variant is going to select for increased vaccine escape."

Also, because of the heavy summer travel happening, it shouldn’t be left to local governments to advise on masks.  This is a collectivist problem, the planes are packed, delivering infected people everywhere from everywhere.  I’m disappointed that the Biden administration is following in the footsteps of the Trump administration in this matter.

Critically, the efficacy of a vaccine depends on the immune competence of each individual. (A vaccine is not a bullet proof vest. We can put a vest on a healthy line backer or on a skeleton. Both will be protected.) Vaccines are likely to be less effective in the aged than in healthy young people. But this is not addressed by public health officials because another significant protection for the aged lies in the herd immunity that mass vaccination may guarantee. I hope that lawmakers will recognize that the freedom of some to refuse a vaccination does not include their right to kill me by insisting on being incubators and spreaders of new variants.

I've been a registered Republican since 1960, before most of these sleaze bags were born, and my disappointment and humiliation is profound.

The virus is completely apolitical.  Donald Trump and many Republican governors, by grandstanding about lockdowns and mask mandates, are responsible for hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths and millions of unnecessary cases in America.  They've done this by ignorantly and arrogantly prioritizing short-term business interests over the health of a population they were elected to serve, and advise.  One result is devastation of the businesses they pretended to protect.

A united, educated and competent state and local leadership could kill this virus in a few months.  The comical stupidity of some Republican assertions that mask mandates somehow violate our ""freedom"" becomes clear when you realize that it's no different from the widely accepted mandate that we all wear coverings over our genitals.  When Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) appears in public with his equipment hanging out, I might begin to take his blather about ""freedom"" seriously.

Think about this political behavior the next time a friend or relative dies or is disabled by a virus that could have been contained by leadership like that in New Zealand.

We need a Republican party that acknowledges science."

In my opinion the CDC director naively believed the unvaccinated would be honest about their vaccine status, and it seemed as if variants brewing in the stew of unvaccinated affecting vaccinated people weren’t considered. Covid is endemic now."
2021-07-23 09:40:52,"3% of hospitalizations are vaccinated people, but how many vaccinated people are getting sick, and how many of those are being hospitalized? Sad to say that even our Democratic politicians are playing with statistics.

The set of people in the hospital includes people who were not vaccinated. The set of people who were vaccinated is the one that concerns me. What percentage of that set gets sick, and what percentage of the set that gets sick gets very sick? It’s not the same analysis."
2021-07-23 09:41:30,"This COVID has learned how to make itself deadlier and deadlier. There is now a Delta+ virus that has evolved in India. It is killing people faster. 

They have found that this virus has mutated 32 times in one particular case. Even some vaccinated people have been infected again.

It means we have to keep the masks on. At least till the picture becomes clear.

It means every part of the world needs to be vaccinated. Neglecting the poor and the poor countries will come back to haunt the rich ones."
2021-07-23 09:42:07,"Why are there ""breakthrough"" Infections? Think of the Alamo. The Alamo was a fortress that was overwhelmed by superior numbers. In the same way vaccinated people who come into contact with enough unvaccinated infected people can get a ""breakthrough"" infection. The big difference is that in this case the vaccinated people don't die,"
2021-07-23 09:46:59,"Science and truth are relentless!

The Texas Dept of Health released Covid numbers yesterday:  Since Feb 2021, Texas has experienced some 9000 Covid deaths.  Of those 9000, 43 were breakthrough infections.  

That calculates to ~8960/9000 or 99.6% of individuals in Texas who died of Covid since Feb were not vaccinated.

Another way of looking at these numbers: Texas has fully vaccinated 12.5 million citizens ignoring the nay-sayings of its GOP state ""leaders.""  Of these 12.5 million, there have been 43 breakthrough deaths; 43 deaths/12.5 vaccinated persons is 0.0000000344%. 

The numbers make it easy to conclude: If you get the vaccine, you will most likely not die of Covid.  There is a high degree of positive correlation of Covid Survival to getting vaccinated.

Truth and Science are relentless."

Among intelligent people this is not news. Entirely foreseeable."
2021-07-23 10:22:51,"Breakthrough cases were known very early on.  CDC should warn people to wear masks regardless of vaccinations. Poor communication should bear some responsibility.  Careless of people, however, should bear the most of the responsibility.

2021-07-23 10:27:07,"The New Coronavirus vaccine can play a certain preventive role, but it has a great relationship with the physical constitution of the individual. There is no guarantee that a new crown will not be available after vaccination, but it can reduce the symptoms of patients. The New Coronavirus vaccine is still in development and clinical trial.
We should avoid contact with people with respiratory symptoms, and do not go to crowded confined spaces. Wear masks in time and wash hands frequently.

B/c if we go into another lockdown, the economy will take like it's the 1930's all over again.

The article sums them up well., I would add only that Pfizer has produced data that show a falling off of antibodies with time. The mystery is why the CDC does not urge employers and private entities to mandate vaccination like France and Italy. People then would have the choice: get vaccinated or forego employment or private public events. The 10-15 million citizens who are immunocompromised, including myself, have a right to expect our fellow citizens will make the right choice for themselves and their fellow citizens."

I have a real problem with the same experts on TV all the time, where they're all obviously rehearsing for a permanent gig on TV.   

Here is a question for the Press: are these experts paid for their time??

These experts often contradict themselves with their own logic in the same episode e.g., masks vs Vax(s).   One minute vaxed people don't need masks the next they do.   They consistently  conflate & switch-hit the data as to cases, hospitalization and deaths.  

Now they're back on their mask routine  

Fact: The virus is NOT surging across the country; it is surging in areas of the country where people have refused to get vaxed.  This coincidentally happens to be in Trump country (glass half full view). 

Mandating masks makes things worse; it takes away the incentive & point of the vaccinations and it opens up the whole Vax project to criticism 

If masks go back on, Biden & the Dems are done for

If you want to mandate something mandate Vax(s) via Fed & State restrictions of what can be done without Vax(s) 

This virus is not going anywhere; we need to live with it, eventually many yrs from now via natural infections and Vax(s) our immune systems will adapt. Thank you Eros.

2. No way should masks be required for the vaccinated (to protect the selfish unvaccinated???).
3. Sports venues, theaters, businesses, cruise lines, et.al., should absolutely be allowed to require proof of vaccination and to not allow the unvaccinated."
2021-07-23 11:14:11,"Everyone seems to be forgetting the purpose of wearing masks…

You wearing a mask doesn’t really protect you if no one else around you is wearing one. Wearing a mask protects others and the only way they are truly effective is if everyone wears them. Having the vaccinated wear masks when the unvaccinated won’t is ludicrous and will do very little against a variant as contagious as Delta.

Get vaccinated, while the media seems to be rife with anecdotal stories of breakthrough infections (makes for good copy and serves to scare people) when you look at total numbers it’s pretty rare and rarer still that you will end up in the hospital or die."
2021-07-23 11:21:57,"I received my two doses of vaccine against SARS-Cov2 in March.  That gave me a sense of freedom.  However, I continue to wear a mask in most public places.  The science shows that it is possible for me to acquire an infection with the Delta variant, but likely remain asymptomatic.  As described in this article, it is not clear whether or not that I would then become a spreader of disease.  As a courtesy to others, I wear a mask when shopping.  Often I am one of the few with a mask on in the supermarket.  My county is about 40% vaccinated against the virus. 

SARS-Cov2 will continue to burn through the population until 90% have been either infected or vaccinated.  Getting a jab is better than getting the virus."

This nonsense of showing your card to get into concerts, movies, etc., is just that - nonsense.  Went to a Mets game a few weeks ago and sat in the ""vaccinated"" section.  Did anyone ask to see my card?  Nope - not one person.  It's time to face reality - this country is no longer a country of honest, caring people.  It's a country of people who only care about themselves and about supporting politicians who bend the truth just as much as they do.  Some of the mandates were lifted too early.  Even the governors in the northeast jumped on the band wagon to lift some mandates and I can't help but feel they caved for purely political reasons.    Everyone, vaccinated or not, mask up!  It won't kill you - but NOT doing so may!  Do you really know if you have any under-lying health conditions?  

Schools will be reopening soon in the south.  Question to the 'brilliant' governors who banned mask-wearing in their states - are you ready to take responsibility for possibly having millions of school children infected with this virus?  Probably not.  Your legislation that masks are NOT permitted is also a violation of people's rights.  Parents - smarten up - put a mask on your child. It's your responsibility to protect your children!  Please don't leave it up to your governors, they only care about themselves."

2021-07-23 11:42:15,"We have become such a society of skewered facts. The scientific community needs to come forward with absolute clarity regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in a manner that explains as many relevant variables as possible. Their failure to do so is what has fueled a lot of confusion, distrust, and failure to comply with the health directives issued by the scientific community itself. We have simply got to get back to being a society of facts and emperical evidence and divest ourselves of this penchant to give credence to the most salacious gossip when life and death are at stake. It is past time now for all of us to get serious about this deadly Delta Variant before it is too late. The one thing that this virus has exposed that seems new in this country is our inability to rally the nation around anything anymore, and it really makes for a bleak looking future going forward."
2021-07-23 11:47:21,"Each person who becomes infected with the Delta variant also becomes an walking opportunity for natural mutations to make the Delta variant more contagious and more lethal. With less than 50% of the American population vaccinated, Delta, and the latest mutations will quickly travel through the population and create a succession of rapidly expanding waves of infections.

 At some point, vaccination will need to become  a mandatory health requirement for all public interactions. 

The Republican right will try to portray this as an attack on individual rights but there is obviously no other way to achieve the herd immunity necessary to drastically reduce the rate of natural selection mutations that will kill ever greater numbers of people and cripple the economy.
  
And we will have to help provide the means to vaccinate all 7.5 billion of us. In a world economy, trade includes viruses."

In my opinion the government should be spending a tiny portion of the trillions in providing N95 masks free to all - and get U.S. manufacturers to produce them - because we need to get off the addiction to Chinese suppliers of medical and military devices."
2021-07-23 12:04:41,A big problem lies in the fact that these infections continue to give the virus more chances to mutate and that means the possibility of a strain more resistant and dangerous.

2021-07-23 12:08:50,"We all believe that having strong immune defenses is better than weak defenses, but with this virus, it prove that excessive strong defenses is a serious weakness able to kill contaminated people with the severe form of Covid19

The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients, so if you're always catching seasonal flu, you're unlikely to develop the severe form of Covid, but if you're never annoyed by cough runny nose and headache or others symptoms like this you can fear the consequence of the Covid.

Vaccination will help your body regulate the immune response, this is why vaccinated people are not dying from Covid anymore.

Having medium immune defense is the best to survive to my opinion, mine is between weak to medium (always catching flu) so this virus was without any consequences. finally I feel strong ! (c;
But of course we can't choose our immune system, we have to do with it."

2021-07-23 12:13:51,"I do worry for my parents who are in their 80s, have heart disease, and living in a low-vaccine area. Despite being Fox-watchers they’ve been vaccinated and were careful to wear masks in crowded public areas prior to the vaccine. As with most of us they are less careful now. 

I still wear an N95 or KN95 in indoor public areas and will continue to do so until this thing is eradicated. The vaccine isn’t 100% effective, we all know that and we also know with more variants developing it could become more deadly or vaccine-resistant. 

In addition to Covid-19 protection, masking has helped with my environmental allergies, asthma and is also protective against flu and colds that for me tend to turn into bronchitis and walking pneumonia. 

It would be better if the unvaccinated came to their senses but clearly that is not happening. I’ll get a booster when they come out."
2021-07-23 12:14:07,"Why should health insurers have to pay for covering anti-vaccers who get sick? People need to pay for selective surgery and hospitalizations. Any result of choosing not to get vaccinated when the evidence is clear a shot would prevent severe illness should be the burden of the individual who makes such a bad decision. Obviously there are other consequences that are horrendous for all humans, but money might influence the naysayers."

2021-07-23 12:18:33,"Eventually vaccination will become de facto mandatory--likely, in my opinion, inefficiently via local private business and nongovernmental institutional requirements. 

As this tipping point nears, first Republicans will blame Democrats for the uptick in new Covid cases, claiming Democrats convinced people to get vaccinated, which caused them to go about catching Covid and infecting others. 

Soon enough, I bet these same Republicans will no longer be yelling about individual rights to refuse the vaccine. Instead, Republicans will concoct some rhetoric of lies to claim it is the fault of the Democrats that everyone is not yet vaccinated."

On both my flights there were passengers near me who kept their masks around their chins. The flight attendants did nothing, likely exhausted by confrontation.

2021-07-23 12:27:04,"This is an irresponsibly reported article.  The article relies on three sources of information.  First, it quotes epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, all of whom say, in substance, that they will follow the science of this disease, that the vaccines are doing what they are intended to do, that vaccinated persons are protected from serious disease, and that there is no reason based on currently available data to change our approach (while recognizing that new data could support modifying our approach).  Next, it quotes a ""doctor"" and a ""biologist"" who suggest that there appear to be far more breakthrough infections than suggested by the epidemiologists and that the vaccines are not performing to the degree we have been led to believe.  The article does not mention that the doctor specializes in sports medicine, and the biologist specializes in amphibians, and therefore neither is particularly qualified to opine on epidemiological matters.  And finally, the article provides anecdotes suggesting that breakthrough infections are widespread.  As the science writer who reported this article is surely aware, anecdotes are no substitute for hard data.  So, at bottom, the article reports alarmist stories with no grounding in data, while the actual experts who were quoted said that we must be guided by actual science, and there is no cause yet to change course.  The consequences of this kind of sensational reporting are amply illustrated by many of the comments."
2021-07-23 12:31:15,"As the rapid spread of Beta and Delta variants are showing, Covid-19 has the sinister capacity to replicate itself in ever more lethal mutants. At this rate, it won't be long before the Omega variant pops up. We're hearing a lot from the Biden administration and federal medical agencies about the imperative of vaccination, but it's falling on too many deaf ears, thanks in significant part to the Republican party's credo of bogus individualism and sowing of paranoia about ""big government"" - a strategy that dates back to Ronald Reagan. More effective messaging would come from local initiatives - from the hospitals, clinics, physicians, nurses that treat people on a daily basis. If we can get the politics out of what should be strictly a public health issue, maybe we can start de-politicizing a great deal more."
2021-07-23 12:33:34,"Media, politicians and scientists drilled in the idea that the vaccine provided 90-95% protection. Now they are changing their tune. To be sure, every one is fallible, but what vested interests do they have to make those prior claims. How much trust can we have in their future pronouncements. This is what comes of politicizing a disease."
2021-07-23 12:35:17,"Vaccines can never prevent exposure nor can they completely prevent infection but what makes them precious is they provide a distinct advantage to those who have never been previously exposed to the virus to be better prepared, immunologically speaking to taken on the virus before the virus causes harm or severe symptoms."

The Delta variant is spreading rapidly here. We have an absolute mask mandate anywhere in public indoors or outdoors and almost everyone adheres to it￼. Other measures are also in place, including the closing of all bars and a curfew. I was observing all restrictions and continuing mask wearing but still got sick. My guess is either while dining or while taking a bus. My mask is not medical grade and I’m guessing it wasn’t effective. My symptoms lasted almost 10 days and I have a few lingering symptoms like a dry cough in the mornings. My lungs feel different, I feel near constant wheezing. ￼￼￼ 
I had avoided Covid in New York City for almost a year and in Mexico for many months before this. The Delta variant is a whole other animal and the J&J vaccine is not very effective against it, as we are now finding out.￼ Be safe out there and continue to take precautions. Vaccinated or not. If you’re not vaccinated please do, it could save your life, I’m sure my symptoms would’ve been much worse had I not been vaccinated.￼"

What will drive up vaccination rates is a mandated vaccination entry requirement for certain activities - like concerts, movies and live theater, bars and restaurants, non-essential air travel, college attendance, and last but not least - political rallies.  Ideally on a federal level but at a minimum on a state level.  If the government can mandate vaccination for measles, mumps, polio, etc., why not Covid-19?  What is the hold-up?  A few lost votes?"

This is further complicated by the many misled and unintelligent people hesitant to get vaccinated who are actively breeding new variants."
2021-07-23 13:13:02,"I think the smartest approach is to get vaccinated, then pay attention to your county infection rate and % of vaccinated individuals in your county by age group. Cases are going up in my county. Ages 16 to 30 are 50% vaccinated, so when I go to the grocery store or hardware store, where the plex barriers have been removed and I am being helped by unmasked teens, I figure my chances of exposure are moderately good. I'm wearing my mask in such places again. The pandemic is not over."

There is ample evidence that it is safe and effective and yes there can be possible side effect but you are at much greater risk if you do not get the vaccine. It is a matter of laziness or a hostile attitude towards anything the government asks of you, even if it is for your own good. 

I know it sounds harsh and very cold hearted but I just don’t care what happens to them at this point. You don’t vaccinate and die…. I just shrug my shoulders because “play stupid games, win stupid prizes”. I do feel sorry for those who are at an age where they cannot get the vaccine due to parents or some other reason beyond their control. The fact that 95+ percent of those who are getting seriously ill or dying should be a wake up call but of course for many it is not. They assume it is all a big scam by the democrats or big pharma so again I just shrug my shoulders and ask…..  “meh, what’s for lunch cuz I am hungry”."
2021-07-23 13:14:20,"This is a good article although it makes it seem like people should be surprised at the conclusions.  None of this is really new or unexpected.  Efficacy rates on all the vaccines were never touted as 100 percent, plus all knew those rates were based on (1) earlier versions of the virus and (2) very limited control groups (limited data).

Consistent with what some commentators have been saying for awhile (Thom Hartmann for example) it was very reckless (and politically motivated) for biden and cdc to make mask wearing into a big issue and something to be shunned. 

Like so many other topics people here stumble blindly and ignorantly while having little awareness of all that’s happening in the rest of the world."

Covid vaccinations are, if anything, MORE effective than the seasonal flu vaccinations. You can hardly get more effective than a (serious) re-infection rate that’s less than one-hundredth of one percent!!"
2021-07-23 13:22:04,"You have to remember that health guidances are necessarily based on statistics and do not necessarily apply to you as an individual. Given the potentially severe consequences of not being being protected (being in the 5% not protected by the full vaccine, or having a health condition (either known or unknown, i.e., developing and as yet undiagnosed), I think it is prudent to continue to take precautions, e.g., indoor masking, distancing and avoiding crowds."
2021-07-23 13:23:45,"If anyone ever promises complete safety in anything, they are lying.  On the other hand, doing nothing against a clear threat means one is completely vulnerable.  Real life is somewhere in between.  So, get the shots and practice the other recommendations and get on with your life.

If you want to go it alone, do not come crying to me because you get severely ill or even wind up on a slab.  All of this could happen, but at least you have bettered the odds against it."
2021-07-23 13:26:00,"Everyone should be screaming at the CDC for not collecting data on breakthrough infections. When the one authority in our country has to say, ""We don't know because we're not collecting the data"", how can anyone trust their decision-making? Someone needs to collect this data!
There also is no data collection on people that have gotten more than one brand of vaccine. The data collected regarding who has been vaccinated will be seriously flawed because it does not account for fundamental information. When our country says a certain percentage of people are vaccinated, it does not account for those that have received two brands of vaccine (in my case the J&J and the Pfizer)."
2021-07-23 13:26:03,"The Democrats are in charge and are responsible for taking the actions necessary to protect us by getting COVID under control.  

Nearly 100,000,000 Americans over the age of 18 remain without a single dose of vaccine.  Unacceptable. 

The Democrats control both the White House and Congress, and therefore have the power and authority through Executive Orders and passing legislation by removing the filibuster to (at a minimum) mandate vaccinations and requiring the law-enforced quarantine of those refusing the vaccine.

What are Biden and the Democrats waiting for?"
2021-07-23 13:28:52,We're in a tight spot.  Evolutionary biology shows that escape is driven by countermeasures.  But pointing that out is immediately dismissed by the narrative.
2021-07-23 13:31:15,"This article starts out with misleading information. The wedding was not the origin of infection in Oklahoma, it was the bachelorette party held in a bar two days earlier:“Based on the symptoms, Dr. Freitas [the bride] believes that the initial infection was at a bachelorette party two days before the wedding, when a dozen vaccinated people went unmasked to bars in downtown Oklahoma City; seven of them later tested positive. “. 
This is a grave error that once again targets weddings as primary culprits in spreading disease.
Furthermore, the writer gives no recount or link to sources to support the statement that “Raucous Fourth of July celebrations disperse the virus from Provincetown, Mass., to dozens of places across the country, sometimes carried by fully vaccinated celebrants.” 

In this special moment in history, we need more social reconciliation, something that political rallies, sports events, bars, and shopping malls do not offer. 

Weddings do.

Yes, weddings gather people in large groups, but it is also the industry hit the hardest with regulations and restrictions, singled out above restaurants and bars, and the untouchable sports industry.

No, weddings are not just frivolous shows. They are a celebration of love, commitment, family, and community. The pandemic has helped people prioritize events in their lives and they choose to show up for the people they care about, in the same room with all that love."
2021-07-23 13:33:32,"For SIX months I have said the same thing; require vaccination cards for travel on all airlines and public interstate transport. Situation solved. We do passports and licenses so the technical infrastructure and delivery system of documents are in place.

Cost? Miniscule.  What do you think Covid is costing every day and what will another shutdown cost us?

Everything is in place except the political will. As Biden likes to say; ""Come on, Man!"""
2021-07-23 13:38:40,"The virus picks up new tools as it moves from human to human.  The alpha variant reproduced more abundantly having greater infectivity than the original virus.  The delta variant is even more infectious shortening its incubation time so it can infect another human sooner.  The next barrier the virus will breach is the ability for vaccinated people to infect others.  After that, it is a matter of months before the virus causes worse symptoms.   When do we name the omega variant?  Vaccinations and masks are our only hope."
2021-07-23 13:39:54,"One can only go so far in convincing people who don’t trust vaccines or don’t trust doctors or believe that  
Hydroxychloroquine and bleach are effective cures for the virus to get themselves vaccinated.

H.L. Mencken wrote a devastating essay on chiropractic science in 1924, the logic of which still holds up very well today on people who are refusing to get themselves vaccinated:

""If a man, being ill of a pus appendix, resorts to a shaved and fumigated longshoreman to have it disposed of, and submits willingly to a treatment involving balancing him on McBurney’s spot and playing on his vertebra as on a concertina, then I am willing, for one, to believe that he is badly wanted in Heaven. And if that same man, having achieved lawfully a lovely babe, hires a blacksmith to cure its diphtheria by pulling its neck, then I do not resist the divine will that there shall be one less radio fan later on.""

It is funny."
2021-07-23 13:42:40,"Due respect to the author, but the natural origin of Covid is unproven.

Meaning that there are two theories being investigated. One seems increasingly more likely."
2021-07-23 13:43:11,"A month ago, I ran the numbers to see what my chance of a breakthrough infection was. (I’ve been fully vaccinated).  The stats that I found indicated that my risk was about 1:4800.   Then 6 fully vaccinated Texas Democrats, out of a group of 50 have tested positive.  If asked about the chances of a break-through infection, now my answer is: 1 out of 8.  Yes, all have been mild, so the vaccine is still absolutely worth getting, but our government is not being honest about the statistics.  Our governmental health leaders appear to have lost credibility.  Be absolutely honest, for if not, it will backfire.  The numbers still strongly support being vaccinated."
2021-07-23 13:43:44,"Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were rated at about 95% efficacy. That means out of 100 million people, about 5 million will get breakthrough infections. I don't think we're seeing vaccinated COVID infections above that rate right now, so why all the doom-and-gloom that the vaccines aren't working. They're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing."
2021-07-23 13:44:42,"Stop calling asymptomatic cases “breakthrough infections.” Just because people are testing positive thanks to hyper sensitive PCR tests, does not mean they have an infection. If a vaccinated person gets fairly sick (has a fever for instance), then get tested and comes back positive, we can consider that a sort of breakthrough infection. The situation with MLB or Olympics, which has mandatory tests, is confusing the public and leading to more vaccine hesitancy excuses. 

Nearly all of the hospitalized people who’ve been vaccinated have compromised immune systems. The vaccines work even better than the impression that is being given by the media right now."
2021-07-23 13:45:07,"Thanks to the anti-vaxxers, mostly in bright red states, even people who are fully vaccinated are being infected by the mutation of the Covid Delta variant, one that is 1000% more infectious than the first strain.

Vaccines against polio, measles, smallpox and others highly contagious illnesses used to be mandatory and some still are.

Even now, when entering certain foreign countries, passengers still have to carry their little yellow vaccination book in order to enter.

The ones that cry the loudest that the big, bad, government is threatening their beloved ""freedom"" should vaccination against Covid-19 be mandatory, are also the ones that never were in the possession of a passport and never crossed a border into another country."
2021-07-23 13:46:00,"COVID is still a developing, morphing, moving target virus. It is likely that we will all need periodic booster shots, a prevention that is well known to older Americans, like me, but not so much to those under age 40 or so. 

But COVID also is a political virus, and that’s the rub. An extensive, years long public service ad/social media campaign is called for — one that would be difficult for anyone to miss. Additionally, employers must be mandated to require proof of vaccinations and boosters or be fined, suspended or fired. 

Harsh? The first version of COVID has killed more than 4 million people globally. And that Is with effective  vaccines that have saved untold millions. 

Covid is here to stay. It’s a cold, hard fact. Those who have perished are silent testimony to this new, fraught, ugly presence."
2021-07-23 13:47:04,"An important piece but the title is miss leading and does not explain Breakthroughs. Fortunately the fear prompted by the title is ameliorated for those who read the entire essay. Breakthroughs   occur because rare individuals have underlying conditions, genetic, disease or behavioral, which prevented them from having a robust, fully protective response to the vaccine. Without measuring virus specific antibody or T cells in every vaccinated individual one can not absolutely know that you're resistant to infection. It comes down to statistics, but this is the reason I avoid contact with unvaccinated individuals, potentially super spreaders."
2021-07-23 13:47:10,"Vaccine passports, a jab for a job, and when available… school immunizations. Do it. The longer the virus is allowed to romp freely in vulnerable (unvaccinated) populations, the greater the chance of a new variant appearing. It’s the science of a virus.

Your right to refuse ends when that refusal endangers my or my family’s life.

If you are willingly unvaccinated, contract covid, and die, I’m sorry. I would say more, but I’m fresh out of thoughts and prayers."
2021-07-23 13:48:11,"Dear anti-vaxxers.  When my wife was a child, her sister Barbara got polio.  This was just before the polio vaccine came out and Barbara was one of the last polio victims.  It ruined her life, and the life of my wife's family as they struggled with a partially paralyzed sister.  The sister died two years ago from post-polio syndrome.  My wife, the oldest sister,  is now the only person left in her family.  My wife says she would give anything to have her sister back and well.  We both feel strongly that the anti-vaxxer movement, which is playing a part in some citizens refusing the Covid vaccine, is doing nothing but harm.  The anti-vaxxer movement was initiated by British scientist, Andrew Wakefield, MD who came out against MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccines 20 years  ago.  Since then, exhaustive studies have shown his research was fatally flawed.  He never revealed that his research was paid by attorneys of parents with autistic children wanting to sue MMR vaccine manufacturers.   The Lancet has retracted his paper and as of 2010, Wakefield is no longer allowed to practice medicine in Britain.  Don't let fear of injections keep you from protecting yourself and others from the dread Covid disease.  If we'd all agreed to be immunized and masked from day one, we wouldn't be having to contend with the current variant. Vaccinations should be mandatory.  Makes me think of the phrase, ""Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose"" (but our lives)."
2021-07-23 13:48:45,"People talk a big game about having compassion for underprivileged but there is lots of hate towards the unvaccinated. 

With all this angst going to the unvaccinated, let's remember who they are.

More likely to Black and Latino than white.

More likely not to have gone to college.

More likely to be making under $50k/year.

More likely to be from single parent households.

According to federal data from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey."
2021-07-23 13:49:19,"Tragically, with the current death rate from C19, more Americans will die under Biden than under Trump well before the 2022 midterms.  

We must act now — immediately — mandating nationwide masking, closure of public schools, $$ incentives for vaccinating,  and yes even mandatory vaccinations and the law-enforced quarantining of those testing positive and especially those refusing to be vaccinated.   

We must act now to protect our health and our control of Congress."
2021-07-23 13:59:17,"Despite all the pleading with those who refuse to get the vaccine or God forbid wear a mask I offer this bit of advice: 

You are rejecting the basic concept of how germs and virus' are transmitted.

As such if you need surgery then your doctor should have the option of deciding if he/she will wear a mask. 

When you go to a restaurant the people preparing your food do not need to wash their hands after using the bathroom and can use their bare hands when touching your food.

When coughing no one needs to cover their mouth around you. 

No one needs to wipe down a table either at home or in a restaurant after it has been used. 

When receiving a shot for other illnesses the same needle can be used over and over.

When attending family gatherings and there is dip you can use just one chip and dip over and over from the bowl.

I know this sounds a little odd but this is the logical conclusion to follow if you want to exercise your freedom to at the very least not wear a mask. If you reject virus or germ transmission then at least be consistent and reject it all the way."
2021-07-23 13:59:32,"In my opinion, we should mandate vaccination for everyone living in close contact with other people - if you live in the woods and never see anyone who doesn’t live with you, you would be exempt, but for I guess >99% of the population, it would be mandated (unless there’s a valid medical reason why the person can’t be vaccinated). You don’t have a right to shoot other people so I don’t think you should have a right to give other people covid. I also think the CDC and other public health authorities in this country have been much too eager to abandon masking and other effective precautions at the first sign of their being effective (i.e. when cases diminish)."
2021-07-23 14:07:08,You can thank the unvaccinated for this mess at his point.  How far we have fallen.
2021-07-23 14:07:29,This story can't be true because just a few weeks ago Joe Biden said he had the virus on the run.  Was he overly optimistic or just lying?
2021-07-23 14:10:39,"I am very disappointed in this article. I am 71, recently had bypass surgery and I am looking for straightforward information on how to best mitigate my risks. What I got was a confusing mishmash of ideas. Please don't EVER say ""You don't have to wear a mask if you are with people who report that they are fully vaccinated."" The breakthroughs seem to be frequently asymptomatic so that is a useless statement. Please write an article when you have a clear thesis and the article follows through on the thesis."
2021-07-23 14:13:00,"We will have COVID forever if more action isn't taken. We need to go back to masking in commercial settings. Some stores have signs that say unvaccinated persons should wear masks and vaccinated don't have to. When you, a vaccinated person, are the only one wearing a mask (even in a relatively vaccinated area of 70 percent), there are obviously people--those who refused to get shots--not wearing masks. Despite that you are wearing a mask, you are not protected. Many stores don't even have these signs. People aren't social distancing. They are acting the same way they did before the pandemic. I've seen many people on city and intercity buses and trains who wear their mask around their chins. People were led to believe that they are safe because they are vaccinated, which isn't entirely true. People who won't get shots are happy because now they don't have store employees telling them to put on their masks so they can go about their merry way spreading any COVID germs they have. Employers should demand that their on-site employees get vaccinated. We are getting these variants from people flying or cruising in from other countries, so the US should halt international flights and cruises until this is over, with rare exceptions for vaccinated and recently tested people.  The government should not allow the mask mandate for trains, planes, and buses to expire in September. People who are immune compromised and have had their second doses should be offered a booster."
2021-07-23 14:13:01,"I look forward to watching the contortions bourgeois masses will go through once they realize segregating via vaccination status means a return to second-class citizenship for the many Black and Brown people they claim to care about. Considering they bore the brunt of the virus early on as the burdens of restrictions shifted to the poor, they are immune post-infection. There are acceptable ways of encouraging vaccinations. Discrimination, authoritarian overreach and denial of civil rights in the age of an endemic virus shouldn't be options."
2021-07-23 14:16:57,"Like everyone has had a cold some time ago, everybody will get corona sooner or later if inoculation rates stay too low. For me it is unclear why people decide to keep unvaccinated and prefer to deal with the real thing. It's one way to mend out."
2021-07-23 14:17:15,"Two of my immediate family members were infected two weeks ago. All in my family are fully vaccinated except for our two youngest children who cannot receive it yet. I knew about breakthrough infections but the CDC seemed to downplay the risk, describing it as ""rare"", so I didn't worry about it. I think it is  time to reassess the level of risk!"
2021-07-23 14:20:00,"My wife and I had never stopped wearing our masks, washing our hands,  and keeping social distance even after being vaccinated. We have spent the past year and a half hoping for 'normal'.

It had always been my hope that a ""National Mandate"" in the country would be proposed but as you can see...republicans, red-states, conspiracy theorists, right-wing media, and vaccine scammers have sown doubt and confusion across the country (and the world).

The 'variants' we are experiencing now are more dangerous and highly transmissible. No one knows what may happen with the coming winter months. If this continues, at some point the entire country will need to be told to STOP THE SPREAD!"
2021-07-23 14:24:01,"Its a ""breakthrough"" case see, that's the ticket.  Its not a COVID-19 infection in a vaccinated person, it's just ""breakthrough"" so we are good and you should still worship and trust us."
2021-07-23 14:27:46,"I find this article and headline to be very alarmist and misleading. Breakthrough viruses are a rarity. Show me the numbers. We are trying to encourage vaccination. No vaccination is 100% effective however, many daily activities aren't 100% safe either. Should we all hide in our homes? Driving a car is much more dangerous than breakthrough viruses.  When the whole world is suffering from a pandemic, it is one's civic duty to get vaccinated ASAP in order to protect themselves and others. Vaccination is the best protection in mitigating and eradicating this horrible pandemic period!! Shame on the unvaccinated and the proliferation of misleading information."
2021-07-23 14:28:40,"I keep seeing the head of the CDC, the Surgeon General, Dr. Fauci, and other medical experts appearing on the PBS Newshour. In each of these interviews, these folks practically plead with the viewers to get shots. But the thing is, the audience for the PBS Newshour already has its shots. I don't watch any of the right-wing ""news"" shows (why would I?), but I'm wondering if these experts are also appearing there and imploring folks to get vaccinated. Seems a bit pointless for folks like Fauci to be preaching to the choir each night."
2021-07-23 14:30:19,"Fact is almost 100,000,000 Americans over the age of 18 have not received a single dose.

100M is not due to anti-vaxxers, minorities, Trump supporters or Biden’s messaging. 

Solution?

Put $50B in the Democrat Reconciliation Bill and pay the non-vaccinated $1000 after two jabs.  

That will quickly reduce the unvaccinated by 50%.

And then move on."
2021-07-23 14:32:29,"It's really quite simple. Effect of vaccination is 2-tiered. 
1st line of defense are neutralizing antibodies that vaccinated person's body makes in response to the vaccine. These antibodies bind to the spike protein on the surface of the virus and block it from infecting human cells (since spike protein binding to human Ace2 protein is the first crucial step in infection). Most Covid-19 vaccines out there, and all authorized in US prioritized this protection from infection and used engineered/recombinant spike protein (S-2P) as antigen. mRNA vaccines in particular elicit generation of neutralizing antibodies at high enough titres to block infection with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19, and those variants like Alpha (B.1.1.7) that code for spike protein similar to the one used as the antigen. Delta variant has enough mutations (leading to amino acid substitutions) in its spike protein, so that neutralizing antibodies bind it less well (reported drops in affinity range from 12 to 80 times). Even so, some protection from infection remains.
2nd line of defense depends on broader immune mechanisms, which summarily are known as cellular responses. These limit infection by destroying infected cells and circulating viral particles, so that infection does occur but is way less severe and/or fatal. These mechanisms are also primed by the vaccination and are less affected by mutations in the virus spike protein. E.g. Pfizer vaccine protection against Delta is 88%."
2021-07-23 14:35:10,"All viral infections must be viewed in the context of a numbers game. Once introduced, the virus -- or a newly emerged variant  that arise by means of a natural selection process-- is always present and circulating within a population of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. There is a threshold dose with respect to the number of virus particles required to produce disease. For example, viruses that require 10 virus particles to produce disease are said to be more virulent than those that require 1,000 or more viruses particles . Thus, it is possible -- for vaccinated as well as non-vaccinated individuals -- to be infected, but not to the extent that there is disease requiring medical treatment and hospitalization. In either case, one would test positive for the presence of viral mRNA; this simply indicates past exposure to the virus, not necessarily active infection or disease.  So, vaccination really just prevents the number of viral particles from ever achieving the threshold for producing active infection and disease. The risk to both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals increases significantly in populations where there are more unvaccinated than vaccinated individuals because the overall number of viral particles circulating within that population is increased appreciably."
2021-07-23 14:35:10,"People forget that when you take flu shots ( a vaccine) you still may get a cold. But the symptoms and the cold are much, much milder. Expecting not to get Covid after vaccination is not realistic.
But if you get it, you do not need a respirator or God forbid , die. Let’s get real"
2021-07-23 14:37:09,The CDC should be tracking all breakthrough COVID infections.  They owe this to those of us who took the leap of faith and got vaccinated at their recommendation.  I imagine the vaccine manufacturers prefer that there be no tracking of how effective their products truly are against breakthrough infections.  What are  CDC and manufacturers afraid of?
2021-07-23 14:38:47,"It is disturbing that we are seeing a continuation of the Covid public information two-step of saying one thing, then another during this current surge.  We were told that the vaccines would end the pandemic, with the understanding that not everyone would assent to the shots. That obviously was wrong. Instead of lecturing everybody about vaccines, what the public health authorities should be forced by journalists to do is give an acceptable definition of what constitutes the end of the pandemic, and why they weren't explicit about the potential fallbacks when the vaccines first became widely available.  At all administrative levels, they have been wrong as often as they have been right during the pandemic's course, and it's time for them to be held accountable by reporters, instead of being cooed over under the false assumption that everything they say is correct."
2021-07-23 14:42:57,"how this is different than Flu.

You receive a flu vaccine and even after that, you will get mild flu.

The upper respiratory infections vaccine is not 100% protected. 

Why is so difficult to understand this issue people?"
2021-07-23 14:43:59,"It is extremely infuriating that my family, friends and my own health remain in a state of anxiety - even though we've all had the wherewithal and a commitment to the common good to have chosen vaccination - because half of our neighboring citizens are either too selfish, too consumed with their own spoiled ""freedoms"" whatever that means, or too ignorant to also have done the same. The federal government needs to really take urgent and immediate action and start pressuring private companies to start requiring vaccinations before people can enter the workplace, movies, venues or anywhere else. Enough of one subset of Americans literally endangering the lives of the rest of us."
2021-07-23 14:44:21,"Here in Las Vegas the city is wide open. (#1 spreader location for Covid in the US per the White House). The strip is packed daily with tourist, the majority unmasked.  Garth Brooks concert was 69,000 people sitting shoulder to shoulder. It was suggested  that masks be reinstated in Nevada, but the fear is tourist will not come if they have to mask up.  Business will not attend conventions if they have to wear masks.  NV will loose more tax dollars.  So rather then being responsible and requiring masks, NV has put dollars over lives.  It's that simple.

We still wear our N95 masks whenever we leave our home.  It's uncomfortable, but worth it to stay well."
2021-07-23 14:45:39,"If symptoms are mid to none and testing is next to none, presumably we have no idea of the total number of people w breakthru infections current or past. Seems a transmission problem no one talks about."
2021-07-23 14:45:51,Have people never received the Flu vaccine? It’s efficacy is much less (maybe 40%) but millions get this every year.
2021-07-23 14:49:22,"They really need to expedite, as far as is scientifically and medically responsible, full FDA approval for the existing vaccines.

Then it becomes legally easier to insist on vaccination status for jobs or activities, esp for the federal govt.


This is akin to dealing with children. You are reasonable and explain to them as best possible. But past a certain point, noncompliance elicits consequences."
2021-07-23 14:50:56,"Ms Panthagani says, “Vaccine efficacy isn’t 100 percent — it never is. We shouldn’t expect Covid vaccines to be perfect, either. That’s too high an expectation.”
Exactly. In fact, it's kind of amazing how effective our vaccines are. Truly.
I will continue to mask in crowded places, like the grocery store, but already having COPD, it is like the vaccines have given me a bit of freedom to engage in social situations without  the dread that COVID would kill me. But thank all the Powers that Be for an effective deterrent against this nasty bug."
2021-07-23 14:52:59,"I actually hope that an honest discussion of what a vaccine can and cannot do might help motivate some of the holdouts.  I got vaccinated as soon as I was legally eligible, but I did so mainly for egoistic reasons: I really didn't want to end up in an ICU on a ventilator. I get vaccinated (against COVID-19, tetanus, influenza etc) for the same reason I wear a seatbelt when I drive: if things hit the fan, my odds of making it without serious injury or death are so much better with it than without. The numbers on COVID bear this out: just look just who ends up in the ICU with a tube down their throat.   So, if you're still unvaccinated: Forget all those arguments around "" protecting others""; get vaccinated to protect yourself."
2021-07-23 14:56:11,"Preventing every case was never the goal of vaccines.  The goal was to make sure that the vast majority of those cases did not correspond to serious or debilitating illness.

This article also speaks about covid positive cases occurring at a wedding as if it was a moral failing for all involved.  This is absurd.  A group of vaccinated people were in a social situation and the vaccines did the job of protecting them all from serious illness. Everyone had no worse illness than a cold. This is a vaccine success story.  The vaccines allowed normal life to proceed without people getting seriously ill.  Why is it being talked about like it is some horrible tragedy?  

The coronavirus is going to be out there forever and be endemic.  If the only metric for success is zero PCR positives for covid and we can't accept even mild illness, we will never be able to experience human social interaction ala 2019 ever again."
2021-07-23 14:59:36,"Why is no one feeling any sense of responsibility toward the nation’s children? Who aren’t yet eligible for vaccinations? And won’t be for awhile. 

They need to be able to see their family and friends again. And get back to regular school and routines, some sense of security.

Of course there are the immunologically vulnerable, transplant patients, chemotherapy, many other options — dir whom the immune response is subpar. They can’t change that.

Why would we, the healthy and vaccine-eligible people, not want to do our part to protect the children?

When did we get so selfish and self-centered?"
2021-07-23 15:00:31,I would really love to know what the long-covid risk is for the vaccinated. Data on that is sorely needed.
2021-07-23 15:05:18,"Getting vaccinated for some, particularly younger people, may not be that simple a choice. For me at 68 years-old, it was a very simple choice; the vaccine benefits clearly outweighed any associated risks. But, if I was 20 years-old again, in good health, or already had a case of Covid, I'm not sure I would rush to take an emergency authorized vaccine. And, I don't see it as unreasonable to wait until more data is in, and the vaccine receives full approval. Most of the articles I've seen seem to ignore that younger folks have a very different risk profile regarding outcomes from Covid and that some may be actually making a rational decision to wait a bit longer. It would be selfish for me to insist everyone must get vaccinated now, as so many are doing, Of course, if the reasons for waiting are ignorance, or that the government is going to track you, or that it's experimenting on minorities, or that the vaccine will cause sterilization, it's indeed a tougher argument to swallow. Perhaps, instead of prizes there should be more targeted public service announcements hammering home the positive facts we do know about the  vaccines and acknowledging the legitimacy of making the best health decision for yourself."
2021-07-23 15:07:07,I have not read  which vaccine has had the most breakthrough infections. Is it a secret?

How casually cruel and arrogant, indeed perhaps sociopathic, would a pundit need to be to (even now still) propose not getting vaccinated or (illogically and hyperbolically) volitionally manipulate getting vaccination?

We all know which trust fund host that might be …"
2021-07-23 15:13:43,"I don't want anyone to get Covid, including the millions who are eligible to be vaccinated but don't. But, as a fully vaccinated person, I'm not concerned about infecting these people if I am unlucky and get a breakthrough infection with mild-to-no symptoms. If I do, it's unlikely that I'd even realize I'm infected. Clearly, It's incumbent on the unvaccinated to get jabbed, and mask-wearing rules should not change for those, including me, who've done the right thing."
2021-07-23 15:15:12,We were told from the beginning that the vaccines were not 100% effective.  It's a bonus to the vaccinated that if they get the virus it won't land them in the hospital.
2021-07-23 15:16:29,"We are on the verge of once again being too insular and self absorbed. Look at vast swaths of the world around us where cases and deaths are spiraling out of control (and vicious new variants likely incubating).

Aside from the debate about breakthrough infections, there also is global concern from a public health perspective about the delta variant’s ability to lower the efficacy of current vaccines in India and the UK. The marvel of mRNA is that it can almost instantly be reprogrammed to optimally immunize against nasty new variants, so next year’s covid booster shot should be able to block delta and more. I’m glad that Biden recently called upon a global set aside or relaxation of patents on covid vaccines because he can exert muscle of the fact that NIH co-owns the patent on mRNA itself, which they’ve licensed to bioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna for their own patented vaccines. 

We’ve gotta get the rest of the world vaxxed and that’s a huge challenge. Otherwise vicious new mutations will keep incubating elsewhere and we’ll continue to play whack-a-mole in the US when they inevitably infiltrate here. 

In the meantime mask-on in public indoor settings, socially distance, avoid gathering in throngs.  Quoting Dylan from John Wesley Harding, “don’t go mistaking paradise for that home across the road”."

2021-07-23 15:22:09,"We've all been forewarned. Is humanity wise enough to act with caution and responsibility? At this point in time, apparently not.

Similar situations that are equally disconcerting:

* The world's (and each nation's, state/province's, city and town's, and individual's) reaction, thus far, to global warning.

* The belief and acceptance by many that the legitimate press concocts and spreads fake news.

* The acceptance by many that truly fake news by such purveyors as Fox News, et al constitutes the truth.

They are also spreading to their friends and family members. I hear that Trump supporters are against the COVID vaccine. I have news for them that Trump and his family members were vaccinated before anybody. Ask Anti Vaccine pundit Tucker Carlson whether he got the vaccine? The answer is Yes. By the way, no vaccine or even medicine is 100 % effective. If you are vaccinated and got COVID, severity and suffering will be much less very similar to flu vaccine."
2021-07-23 15:24:58,Why are these people so dead set against this vaccine?  Didn't mean to say dead set against but that is what might happen to them if they don't get the vaccine.
2021-07-23 15:28:07,"We need to address how people take care of themselves and their effect on the immune system. 
Stress, diet, sleep, and other factors significantly affect our immunity.  
In recent times, we have had the highest child poverty rate, millions of baby boomers wondering how they will live in their later years.  Millions of young folks without a college degree see their real wages eroded over the decades.  They can't afford to eat good food or take a vacation.  Two jobs to make ends meet, and they live under tremendous stress.  It's no wonder how a promising vaccine can't be fully effective with those conditions."
2021-07-23 15:28:22,What scares me is that the fatality rate among the breakthrough cases is the same as the overall fatality rate for Covid 19.
2021-07-23 15:30:16,"We need to understand to what extent the misinformation about vaccines is spreading even faster than the virus. I think we are truly under attack from authoritarian regimes that are trying to end democracy. One of the ways they are trying to accomplish this is by literally killing Americans with lies, while sowing division and confusion to the point where we are in an ideological civil war. We are under attack and the Republican Party is still aiding and abetting those foreign adversaries and their agenda in accomplishing the end of democracy.

2021-07-23 15:48:07,"If unvaccinated people are willing to accept risks, they should also be willing to pay for an insurance rider tailored for them. Then, if they get sick, the remaining population does not bear the cost of the tribal benefits they obtain from not being vaccinated."
2021-07-23 15:48:17,"I’m more afraid of catching a new variant that will be able to evade the vaccine than I am or catching Delta. These ignoramuses who refuse to get vaccinated will be to blame when that happens. I can only imagine what’s going to happen in the schools when unvaccinated kids mingle together, unmasked in stagnant air for 7 hours."
2021-07-23 15:48:23,"Right. So there is no need to shut the world down again, particularly for vaccinated people.

To those saying they felt awful for a week, that does stink but it’s not a reason to shut down or reduce  business capacity etc. I had the flu in 2017-18 and lost 15 pounds and it took me months to get back to normal. But I wouldn’t suggest we stop the world or all wear masks so I don’t ever get sick again. I now get the flu vaccine. 

Get the vaccine if you haven’t and get on with life."
2021-07-23 15:52:42,"One of the concerns about lack of vaccinations, by choice or in countries lacking access to enough vaccines, was that mutations would lead to variants that the vaccines don't protect against. This partially happened already with the Delta variant. Yes, the vaccines protect against death or severe illness, but there are a lot more breakthrough infections than with other variants, and the CDC isn't even tracking the numbers of these.

The more the virus circulates, the more chance that an even worse variant will develop. It's time to confront this country's unwillingness to impose public health restrictions."
2021-07-23 15:59:03,"Please. 97% of hospitalized Covid patients are nonvaccinated.
There is no golden goose for any disease. The flu vaccines are at best 60% effective."
2021-07-23 16:02:16,"Given many Americans avoid going to the hospital even when seriously ill for fear of not being able to afford the bill, the CDC assumption that most breakthrough cases are “mild” or “asymptomatic” is naive at best.

Now the CDC has made a strategic decision to only investigate breakthrough cases “among patients who are hospitalized or die”, leaving us with no meaningful information of assessing our risk of infection on the ground at this point.

The CDC has managed to botch multiple calls at pivotal points during this pandemic, from failing to recommend mask use on the front end, to the irresponsible decision to suggest that vaccinated people should unmask in public despite the high percentages of unvaccinated people in many communities throughout the country and the unvaccinated status of children.

Many of us get that this pandemic is dynamic and the CDC won’t have all the answers.  But the evidence of some ill conceived political decision making at the CDC is pretty hard to miss.

We’re essentially on our own here."
2021-07-23 16:02:58,"Some of these headlines confuse people. They don’t say that vaccinated people are having milder symptoms if at all most of the time when they get infected. Most probably didn’t even know they’re infected. They mention it, but one has to spend time reading them, and many may not. So people are likely to just look at the headline and conclude that the vaccines aren’t really working anyway cause people are still being infected."

I’m in an online support group with thousands of other long haulers, and we have had many people join the group who were fully vaccinated and went on to get covid and develop long covid. This is why the CDC should be tracking asymptomatic or low symptomatic breakthrough cases. There is no way to determine the likelihood of breakthrough cases leading to long covid without data. 

Long covid has completely changed my life for the worst. I’m a 25 year old, previously athletic woman now barely able to take care of myself. Vaccinated people need to protect themselves and stop acting like they are in the clear."
2021-07-23 16:13:19,Vaccinated are getting breakthrough infections because of anti-vaxxers. The source of their misinformation needs inoculation.

2021-07-23 16:15:47,"I have no patience left for my fellow citizens who have refused to be vaccinated. But unless the entire world is vaccinated in very short order, variants are going to appear anyway. Constant monitoring of the virus's mutations, and adjusting the vaccines, is the new norm, at least for the nex few decades."
2021-07-23 16:21:21,"I'm one of those vaccinated people who still got COVID. I felt lousy for two days and I lost my smell/taste for two weeks, but that was it. I wonder how much worse I would've been had I not been vaccinated."
2021-07-23 16:43:14,"It is well for the media/press to attempt to educate the populace about this disease, but virology is complex.  Broadcast and print media can’t carry the burden. Sound bites/limited copy space don’t match the gravity of the subject.
CDC is best situated to deliver all this knowledge and information, although they have a long way to go to regain credibility after initial slipups with testing and contact tracing. Most of our science exists at the academic level and thus we do not have the robust public health system of the UK. NIH’s historically politically appointed leadership clearly hasn’t worked at the pandemic level. Bush commissioned a pandemic plan; have you heard about that? Long term, that needs to be fixed. 
Additionally, our populace has to overcome is the notion that statistically based public health discussions/decisions apply to specific individuals; stats don’t work like that and never have. While you can accurately say vaccines are 80% or more effective against Delta (they are) and even more effective in suppressing serious cases, you can never say any given person won’t get the bug. 
Virginia released results for its 4.5 million vaccinees; 1,157 breakthrough cases, with only 18 deaths among them. If everyone nationwide had been vaccinated 18 months ago, that 18 out of 4.5 million ratio would have translated to fewer than 1,500 total deaths in the US versus 625,000 to date. The 1,500 would still be tragic, but 623,500 would, using probabilities, NOT be tragic."
2021-07-23 16:45:18,"The question all my relatives keep berating me with after hearing this news is ""How do the rates and severity of the disease differ from one vaccine to another?"""

However, there is no honor among thieves. Expecting people who are on board with lying to tell the truth about being vaccinated to go without a mask was a huge error. It opened the floodgates, and just wait until kids are back in school soon.  

 Other countries have had to pull back and enforce mask mandates again. Bottom line is we are in a pandemic, everyone should be vaccinated and wearing a mask until this thing hopefully goes away. Period.  Unfortunately, we have the red states that refuse to enforce mask mandates and like in Florida, even go so far as to issue an executive orders to for bid a local official from creating a mask mandate in their area.   So this will continue endlessly with all of us suffering the variants that will endure due to willful ignorance and the politics of half the country embracing the media they cling to of misinformation."

But ""Darwin"" doesn't care what ""people"" want and will resolve the numerous issues, in favor of those inoculated."
2021-07-23 17:30:42,"The main takeaway is that as effective as the vaccines are, Covid-19 is still not the flu.  It is still more contagious and not as seasonal.  And while we may not need a full lockdown, I hope, we can't go back to the halcyon days of 2019 either.  So even fully vaccinated people have to be cautious and mindful.  Have a gathering outdoors.  Threading that needle will helps us find a way forward...IF enough people get vaccinated."

2021-07-23 14:38:12,"The CDC made a stupid mistake when it advised that vaccinated people could go without masks indoors, relying on an ""honor"" system for the unvaccinated. Of course the unvaccinated, who are in denial about science, would be the first to discard masks.

2021-07-22 10:40:24,"Japan is taking a big risk by hosting the games within the virus crisis. Olympics without the cheering crowds is a much-diminished event. Especially during these tough economic and pandemic times, the Olympics have outlived their shine.

Putting so much expense on the host country is not viable anymore. Perhaps races and matches should be held virtually in these zoom times."
2021-07-22 10:42:48,"Technically there are no Olympic games in 2021.  The spectacle they are attempting to put on is a weak attempt to salvage profit above a world-wide pandemic.  It is shameful that the games were ever considered after 2020.  Now with elite athletes voluntarily dropping out and being removed due to Covid-19 and Delta Variant infections the level of competition has been tarnished beyond repair.  

I look forward to the next true Olympics, the winter Olympics of 2022."
2021-07-22 11:17:13,Question: has every athlete been vaxed?
2021-07-22 12:19:26,"Typical for Western journalism, this article is written as if Japan exists in a political vacuum, and that a ""stagnant economy"" and ""sclerotic practices"" can explain everything. The bigger problem is sclerotic politics. 

The ruling LDP had been in power for less than 9 years in 1964. Today it's been roughly 62 of the past 66 years. (It's not because they're popular -- it's because we have a very regressive election law, so that they can get a majority of parliamentary seats even without getting a majority of votes cast.) This is the real problem with Japan: leaders who have a sense of complacency and entitlement, and whose main concerns are power and in-fighting, not the country's future.

Everything about this Olympics is political. 2021 is an election year, with a vote required by the autumn. The LDP believed for years that it would get a post-Games ""feel-good"" bounce. That's why the prior Administration patently lied about Fukushima to get the Games, and why the current one is risking peoples' lives to hold them. 

The brazenness of this calculation, compounded by policy fumbles that worsened the pandemic even before the arrival of tens of thousands of visitors while other countries are closing their borders, has made people here even more sour about the Games. To report on the state of Japan without mentioning this noxious political atmosphere is telling less than half the story."

They don't provide anything for communities in need of support, investment, and better living conditions. Their time and place have come and gone. Either build a permanent facility somewhere for winter and summer games and keep having them there, or just cancel them outright.

 - Fresh, cheap food for everyone
 - Free national healthcare
 - Clean subways that are always on time
 - No crime
 - Slow, but steady progress on inclusion and diversity
 - Heavily subsidized childcare 
 - Great public housing
 - No drug abuse / overdose deaths 
 - Reliable, high quality service everywhere

New York is great if you make over $500k. For everyone else it is expensive and the quality you get is awful. Japan is a safe, beautiful place to live. And oversimplified comments like “stagnating GDP” (not even per capita, which is more relevant) completely overlooks that quality of life in Japan improves drastically year after year. I disagree with the title of this article and believe it bashes a country that is heading in the right direction, while everything for 80%+ of Americans continues to decline. 

Japan has many issues too. Shrinking workforce, tight government grip on mass media, not supporting single mothers, and lots of societal pressure on individuals to conform, amongst others. But this article makes it sound like Japan is failing, whereas I'd say the improvements over the last three decades far exceed the issues this article mentioned."

Their determination to scrap for every point  was eventually followed by western nations in the following Games. Maybe they should be honored by having them light the torch in the opening
ceremonies in this Olympics?"
2021-07-22 17:01:21,"It may be time for people in Japan to stop investing so much meaning in the Olympics. Probably no other country's media does so to the extent that Japan's mass media does. Rome, Italy hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960, just 15 years after Benito Mussolini had been shot dead and strung up from a structure for public viewing by leftist Italian partisans. Italy was in dire economic condition in the early postwar years and likely would have gone communist (known as a ""communism of the stomach"" due to widespread poverty and malnutrition) had U.S. authorities not interfered in the 1948 election. 

And yet, as far as I know, the Italian people and media are not super fixated on the 1960 games as signaling the country's rebirth or recovery. Maybe it's because Italy was never the top economic power in Europe and in fact has long been viewed as a laggard held afloat initially by U.S. and then European Union (i.e. German) aid. 

Japan was the top economic power in Asia for decades after 1964, but it's clear now that its status during those years was somewhat artificial. It was always a bit strange and bizarre that Japan was an economic superpower while far more heavily populated India and China were poverty-stricken agrarian societies. There was no way that situation was going to endure forever. China and India are now the world's top two steel producers, a far more ""normal"" state of affairs considering more than a third of humanity resides in just those two countries."

2021-07-22 17:02:54,"This whole situation is a shame. Japan is a decent country, and it's nice to see decent countries hosting the Olympics, instead of Russia or China.

Japan also, despite some early missteps, handled COVID fairly well. They could have closed down earlier, especially bars and restaurants. But they also had public health guidance on masks that was wise, and was followed by the public much better than most other countries. Vaccinations have been slower, but they're also not a country that manufactured a vaccine (so less early access). It's a shame that COVID is marring what should be a great moment of national pride for them.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to say that I also believe Japan would have canceled the games by now if not for the pernicious influence of the International Olympic Committee. There is a very real possibility this will be a massive superspreader event - one that seeds Delta around the world, and one that will hit Japan (the decent Olympic host) harder than anyone.

While the GOP has probably done more than any single organization to promote the spread of COVID, the IOC could have a decent shot at taking that title from them.

The Greeks didn't envision this level of corruption when designing the Olympics.  And I think they'd be offended that these games, which were meant to prevent death and destruction from war, may end up killing more people than most wars by the time the spread ceases.

Japan, I love you and good luck!"
2021-07-22 17:32:58,"I admire Japan for persevering through all the adversity to hold the Olympics. If the athletes still want to compete (with many having a very small window in their lifetime to do so) then the spirit of the Olympics is alive and well!

Yes, there are issues with corruption and profligacy through its recent history. But ultimately the games are a celebration of the human spirit, shared across the globe. We need these cross-cultural bridges - at its best the Olympics are a beacon of hope and common purpose. 

Ironically, while many lament the problems of profiteering, Japan is hosting the events despite massive losses in tourist revenue amid the pandemic. This may prove to be the most authentic Olympics in the modern era - hosted purely for the international spirit of the games. It may also be exactly what a pandemic-weary world needs right now.

This requires a decade or more of planning and up-front expense, with the hope of recouping those outlays of money when the games are held, in tourism, tickets, and so on. Now, most of those revenue sources will simply not happen. In short, Japan is darned if they do and darned if they don't go ahead with the Games. I plan on watching, as I always do, events that I only watch every four years (team handball, anyone?), but it will be hard not to feel a bit wistful at the same time, the empty venues being a constant reminder of where we are as a planet, right now.

Republicans demonstrate again their penchant for spite over self interest. They know that they don't have to worry about their own who will die as a result of their lies.

How could what one assumes are  bright people at the CDC not recognize that the anti vaxers and the anti maskers, were in fact one of the same. 
All they did was allow them to unmask  spread the virus and 'here we are'. 
Not only do we need to return to Mask Mandates for all indoors, we also need  the introduction of a Vaccine Passport that would  enable only those vaccinated or those who for medical reasons can not be vaccinated to live a  near normal life.

Apparently, many people think this no longer applies, and that we should be ruled by experts.   The only problem is to create a consensus on who is an expert, and get a majority of voters to vote for the right expert.   Good luck with that!"

Surely beyond belief that elected lawmakers would encourage their constituents to risk severe illness or even death, in order to score points against their political opponents. It is especially egregious coming from the likes of Rand Paul, who have medical qualifications. It is also extremely stupid as a political tactic.

A much better way would be to privately cajole their Glorious Leader (who constantly claims credit for the vaccines) into publicly and repeatedly telling his supporters to get vaccinated. Then when vaccination figures suddenly shoot up, he could also claim the credit for having saved them. 

But perhaps that is too subtle. And of course said lawmakers would not get the publicity they clearly crave."

it might help to compare the vaccine to an MM candy. A real Covid virus contains underneath the MM shell  poisons and mechanisms for reproducing more poison.

The vaccine has an MM shell also but there is no poison or ability to reproduce that poison under the shell.

The body learns to recognize the MM by its shell  and destroy it with antibodies produced by the immune system. 

It is only the shell which bears any resemblance to the real virus and it is harmless.

2021-07-21 11:56:39,"Perhaps a cost analysis per person for members of states with low vaccination rates v. those with high vaccination rates might help sway the conversation. 

Every ICU stay, every ventilator, every ECMO run is incredibly expensive. If the patient is insured, they still are responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills. The uninsured have generationally devastating medical bills after prolonged ICU care. Every patient that cannot pay costs their state ultimately pays for their care. The unvaccinated are statistically far more likely to need prolonged ICU care. The medical financial burden alone will start selectively hurting states with lower vaccination rates. The money has to come from somewhere: higher taxes, local inflation, fewer dollars for infrastructure, etc. The cost trickles down to every member of the state eventually.

Lower vaccination rates = more ICU days = more expensive for states   individuals. 

If science, reason, and the greater medical benefit to yourself and humankind are insufficient to sway certain leaders to promote vaccination, perhaps “it’s the economy, stupid” will help push the needle."

Biden must consider offering Trump the reward of all criminal charges that will be dropped against him and his family if he pushes vaccination. 

This will carry double benefits. Vaccination will succeed, and it will mean that criminal charges being dropped will result in Trump remaining the face of the Republican party and not debarred from competing.

If Trump is the Republican nominee for the race to the White House, a Democratic victory will be assured. So Biden must do everything in his power to make sure Trump remains the next Republican candidate.

The Biden administration must advertise the fact that Trump himself and all Republican leaders have got themselves vaccinated. Their videos taking the vaccination shot must be shown repeatedly with the caption that Trump and his team all took the shot themselves and are discouraging others from taking the vaccine. 

Also, say that Trump and his team do not care for his base. What they care about is to cover their mistake of having neglected to push for vaccination. 

Drive home the point again and again on TV, radio, press, and social media that Republicans are trying to show they were right in their vaccination policy when, in reality, they are huge failures causing so much loss, pain, and deaths."

 First, I don't recall the trump administration ever having a ""vaccine drive"".....can he point out the specifics around that? Secondly, intelligent people can recognize politics vs. science and are more apt to get vaccinated. And lastly, some people aren't getting the vaccine because they really don't want something ""foreign"" and unproven over time in their bodies. We only have to look at how ""safe"" Big Pharma has claimed many other detrimental drugs to be.

A simple market solution that gives hospitals more resources to cover the cost of importing medical staff and not exhausting their existing team.  Republicans love market solutions.

Of course insurance companies won't cover the surge costs so patients will get the bill. Let them cover the cost of the crisis that they are persisting."

Reporting has shown rural health officials in southern Missouri are willing to make secret accommodations for people to get the shot so their neighbors wont get mad at them.

Physician Roger Marshall now says it is questionable for people under 50 to get the shot and blames Psaki for vaccine resistance.  He should be brought up on charges from the medical governing boards and have his license to practice revoked.  Many of the people dying from covid are in their 20's to 40's because that group is largely unvaccinated.  Delta is mowing them down.

Vaccine resistance has taken on a life of its own.  It has become some kind of cause.  People are dug in.  They just wont get the shot no matter what they are told now.  

The people most responsible are those that are just now trying to walk back their rhetoric.  Won't work no matter how hard they try to blame Biden and Psaki.

The Republican Party has been lying for so long (beginning with Reagan’s line that government is the problem) that they no longer know how to tell the truth. Their latest example is to take away voting rights and call it voting integrity. I believe in two major political parities (though perhaps  three would be better to force real compromise), but this Republican Party needs to be decimated because they are heading in a direction that undermines democracy and civil rights by creating laws that ensure permanent power for themselves, regardless of the will of voters. Until they lose elections (assuming that the votes against them are so large that they cannot overturn the results), they will simply continue to devolve into an ever more anti-democratic, anti-minority party that reserves rights only for themselves."

Election officials are now being targeted. In red states, the concept of free and fair elections is being trampled. While I applaud the good things Biden is doing, I have no idea why the worthless parasite Trump is not under indictment for anyone of the myriad of infractions he committed.

Trump is the root of the cancer spreading across the nation."

Seek the lowest common denominator that allows you to appear bold by finding the faults of others.  

The excuses keep getting weaker, and the beliefs keep getting hardened, so let's stop giving them a platform...just stop asking them questions about COVID.  They broke it, they own it.

Trump stopped talking about COVID and the vaccine as the election appeared to be going the wrong way for him in the polls, then of course didn't give it a thought after he lost.  But he was first in line to get the vaccine...in secret.

All of that history is what created the mess we have today, and all the tough, masculine talk of the republicans and the resistance of their followers is cover for the reality that they are wrong, so everything that supports their wrong belief is now the source of truth.

He doesn't appear to be a very insightful or even smart person but he sure does put his body on the line for his beliefs. His magical belief in ideas that are literally deadly to himself is something to behold. Some might call him a fool. I call him a modern Republican."

It is unlikely  that people who have been vaccinated will be seriously or negatively impacted by Delta.   

Among the unvaccinated COVID will continue to spread and Delta will spread like wildfire. Thousands will get needlessly sick and die  from choices that are about as wise as  skydiving without a parachute into an erupting volcano.    

At this point trying to argue with people about the facts is about the same as trying to dissuade them about the validity of their religion. 

The facts are out there.  Significant  efforts have been repeatedly made by reasonable and knowledge people to get the facts out.   

There are those out there  there who believe ""alternative facts"" which are reinforced by elected politicians  who are playing to the room.  

We should be prepared to accept the limitations of trying to minimize the additional carnage  resulting  from  natural selection."

I am sure the video of the G7 leaders taking a picture with their masks on then proceeding to take them off to chat did not help either. Most Americans are ""what's in it for me?"" type of people.  The instant gratification of not needing to wear a mask if vaccinated was not present until recently when it was Randomly lifted."

Those enemies of our country are right-wing legislators, far-right wing nuts on social media, and especially the far-right media, such as billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s Fox “News”, which spew divisive anti-democracy lies 24/7.

Update and bring back the Fairness Doctrine."
2021-07-21 11:36:24,"The GOP is reaping what they have carefully sown for many decades: an anti science stance, distrust in any source other than Fox News and right wing talk radio, a penchant for conspiracy theories, and a deep seated sense of grievance and victimhood.   

But of course, they are never to blame.  Mitch McConnell cannot imagine why people aren’t getting the vaccine, but his KY colleague Rand Paul is one of the worst spreaders on disinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus in the Senate.  They demonize anyone telling the truth, anathema to 45 and his gang.  Tony Fauci is public enemy number 1.  Apparently Jen Psaki is also a big problem right now.  Who knew that the WH press Secretary could singlehandedly prevent thousands of people from getting a lifesaving vaccine?

Importantly, Donald has not gotten his due.  Groveling, bowing and scraping, fulsome praise are warranted on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Where is the love?  People won’t get vaccinated under dear leader tells them to.   Cult leaders can convince the reluctant flock to do as they say.  Dear leader is of course conveniently mum, safely vaccinated.  People like Scalise expect Biden to treat Donald like a co President or better yet to step aside and reinstall him.  The whole party has just become entangled in idolatry of lies.  At this point, they’ll continue to inflict damage on the rest of us and the pandemic will continue in the US, completely unnecessarily.  Thanks, Donald."

Trump has gotten vaccinated, so has his family, so has EVERY talking head on Fox news. These ""Republicans"" or whatever they really are these days KNOW that vaccine is safe. There using their lives to make an irrational political statement and they don't care who gets sick and dies. It's like they WANT to keep the pandemic alive.

 It's weird. I don't pretend to understand it. The ones that get covid and survive are smug about it oblivious to the numerous long term health problems they are now at risk for. I'm curious to see how insurance companies cover any long term issues that arise from people who willfully choose to get covid? 

But the strangest thing are people like Rand Paul who seem to be fighting to keep people unvaccinated and at risk. I get that he's not a real doctor but he should still be able to understand basic concepts of immunology. Yet he chooses to kill off people."
2021-07-21 12:00:18,"If you are waiting to ""see if the vaccines are safe"", have you not been paying attention? 

Billions of shots have been given out around the world and they have a pretty good idea as to the number of people who experience negative reactions and it is pretty low. 

And if you haven't been vaccinated yet, it will probably take you about 2 months to be fully vaccinated. But even getting one shot seems to offer some protection against being hospitalized. 

And if you don't believe the CDC or Dr. Fauci, go talk to your doctor, or walk into your local pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist. Both will almost certainly recommend that you get vaccinated. 

Or you can believe the ""opinions"" of all the airheads on Fox News."

2021-07-21 12:48:41,"Republican ""mixed messaging"" is intentional and strategic. It depends on whether it serves their political goals, not population health or individual health or even so-called ""GOP core principles"".  Everyone should be able to refuse both masks and vaccines, despite evidence that these measures protect both individuals and those in their vicinity.  But when it comes to decisions about marrying those with non-traditional gender identities or whether to sustain a  health-threatening pregnancy, suddenly the values of individual autonomy and well-being get buried in a mountain of outrage and slander.   

The GOP, and particularly Trump, turned Covid-19 public health measures into part of their endless culture war, because the only lever they have is the culture wars.   Their policies are literally killing US citizens while enriching their extremely wealthy funders.  And the hypocrisy is outrageous--I'll bet that Marjorie Taylor Greene is vaccinated.  She's a bully and a liar, but not suicidal.  

There is a perverse consolation in knowing that Covid-19 will continue selectively killing the vaccine skeptical culture warriors, because dead people cannot vote."
2021-07-21 12:49:52,Trump and no doubt his entire grifter family was vaccinated the second it became available yet he stays mum on his supporters doing the same. His minimization of the virus danger and his mocking of all public health guidelines is the very reason his followers refuse vaccination now. They’ve been thoroughly indoctrinated to believe the virus is an overblown liberal hoax and vaccination a government over reach campaign. Not once have any of these Fox personalities mentioned Trump’s vaccination nor have lawmakers. Their whole harangue is this personal freedom nonsense. You would think that Trump’s followers would put two and two together and figure out that their dear leader being immediately vaccinated must mean he perceived the virus as a threat but critical thinking skills are in short supply in this crowd. They also might wonder why he felt the need to do it in secret. Could it be because the big man Rambo role he loves to play is all a con? I doubt that’s occurred to them either. I’ve come to the conclusion that enough is enough with bribing and pleading with the vaccine defiant. They chose lies and misinformation and will have to suffer the consequences. The lawmakers and TV personalities that enable all this will go down in the book of shame as it should be. All the rest of us can do is continue to take sensible precautions and hope that their stupidly doesn’t spawn some worse variant that affects us too.

No system in place, no supplies. 
No promised stockpile of vaccine. 
Just lies followed by silence. 

The GOP has been trying to cover up this massive failure by downplaying Covid’s deadly effects AND the need for vaccination ever since. 
Trump and his minions have politicized and denied their way through the Covid 19 pandemic from it’s very beginning to right now as Delta rages through America and the “GOP Deniers” are still at it. 
If these people worked for an ordinary corporation, they would have been fired long ago.

And if the Dear Leader does not run in 2024, DeSantis is likely the standard bearer.  Maybe he will nominate Representative Greene as VP!  Gaetz as attorney general…

This is a version of the student saying, ""My Teacher Should Have Made Me . . . .""  Has ""The Public"" no individual personal responsibility?  Why does the Times itself not rather take  certain parts of the U.S. public directly to task for wishful thinking about reality and willful ignorance of scientific facts (whether regarding vaccine efficacy or the biological molecular basis of bimodal sex/sexual reproduction in human primates)?  Is it because the Times, like certain Republicans it quotes in the article, does not want to pour gasoline on the fire of juvenile oppositionally defiant offense-mongering?  It is a sorry state of affairs that so many humans, regardless of their political/ideological leanings, cannot or will not think for themselves.  (Bertrand Russell: ""Most people would rather die than think."")  Is there a pandemic of insufficient prefrontal lobe development in this Land of Amuricun Exceptionalism?

Also, when you're talking about conservatives and their ilk why do you say ""vaccine skepticism"" instead of ""vaccine hesitancy""?  It seems to be a distinction without a difference."

He gave all 18 to 30 year old West Virginians a $100 bonds, plus a lottery for all where people received trinkets such as free hunting licenses  and other 'gifts'.

In one of his recent press conferences he said that not being vaccinated opens the doors to death. And he is quite right on that.

Something is rotten in the US when people of a certain party affiliation  have to be bribed into receiving a vaccine during the worst ever worldwide pandemic in slightly over a century."

Members of Congress and members of state governments should be leaders doing what is right for the people they are supposed to be leading. It is pathetic how Republican politicians spout false allegiance to people and ideas that they don't really believe in or respect, but do so because that is the way to convince voters that they are on their side, even when that side is destined for self-destruction and possibly death. America is doomed if so many of its citizens believe the lies sold to them by demagogues, like Donald Trump, who care only about getting elected."

Also, try intubation one time and I guarantee you will do everything in your power to make sure it does not happen to you. The number of people who have and will die next is way beyond anything logical from a “developed” country like ours.

2021-07-21 13:06:36,"GOP lawmakers and the right-wing media are railing against the vaccines because they want the Biden administration to fail, even if it kills a lot of their own supporters.

The claim that it's Biden's fault because he isn't giving Trump enough credit is ludicrous.  A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that ""nearly 80% of Republicans said Trump’s endorsement would not make them more likely to get a vaccine"".

I remain apoplectic that these so-called religious pro-life clowns are so willing to sacrifice themselves and so many others. And it is not just deaths, but also the significant morbidities associated with Covid infections."
2021-07-21 13:08:27,"Yesterday's column by Paul Krugman had a link to an article analyzing leader cults. I would recommend it to everyone. Once inside a cult, logic is turned on its head. Everyone competes to flatter the leader in order to gain favors or avoid disfavor (primary challenges). The flattery soon gets ridiculous (e.g. Lindsay Graham). Since the majority of Republicans are worshippers in the Cult of Trump, even Republican members of Congress who should know better (not a majority) do not believe that they can risk telling the truth without losing power and position. When even MTG feels the need to give what is likely a false impression about her own vaccinated status, you know that the situation is bad. No one should expect anything different from Republicans. If they do well in 2022, it will get worse as they anticipate the second coming of their messiah."

And here in lies the need to go back to what they said last year.  They hold no position.  They only have goals.  If we turn on the way back machine you will find that these people are greased up and jump to the next box. 

They were wrong. They harmed the country and they are looking for a way to avoid the consequences. Just like someone who fears liability they are dancing around the fire calling it water."

The many Republican leaders who continue to support this imaginary world that they apparently believe retains their constituent base are playing to a shrinking audience. I'm beginning to wonder if and when they can join the adults in the room who tell the truth."
2021-07-21 12:57:07,"And some wonder why so many of us are in existential despair about the fate of this species ?

I just read the opening of this to my husband and we spent thirty minutes debating what we do to hold in check the threat presented, not by a disease, but by fellow Americans too stubborn, ignorant, and selfish to care about their fellow citizens.  We ended up as puzzled, baffled, angry and upset as we began. 

What. Do. We. Do? 

This isn't just about the unvaccinated. As the WHO has tried to point out with great urgency, every time we have a new spike in the unvaccinated, we give the virus the chance to mutate in ways that will override our vaccines. I hear way too many smart people state with a shrug, ""Well, we can't control them; if they want to get sick, let them."" My husband coaches a doctor who just said that! No. We're allowing an already dangerous virus to mutate and morph in ways that imperil all of us. 

So what do we DO? Because the FDA has only given provisional approval, we don't have a legal leg to stand on. Schools and workplaces can't mandate something that hasn't been approved. My guess is that even if it were, civil liberties lawyers would continue to make the case that we cannot force someone to take a drug. We're over a legal, ethical barrel. 

Educating people about efficacy and safety hasn't worked, incentives haven't worked, seeing the dead pile up hasn't worked, and coercion won't work. WHAT will work? 

With utter despair, I return to my opening point."

Meanwhile the democrats have been perfect. The VP’s speech on being a ‘good neighbor’ wasn’t the worst speech of her career and I’m sure will reach someone somewhere. The DNC vetting your text messages as reported in politico last week sounds like a winner too. And the knocking door to door has worked wonders for the Bible and vacuum cleaner industry so it’s perfect for dealing with a health crisis.   With all these wonderful institutions and ideas it’s shocking that people would be hesitant about anything."

2021-07-21 13:13:03,"This isn’t just a matter of letting people do what they want and seeing them suffer the consequences. When people refuse to get vaccinated, they are endangering those who can’t get vaccinated—including all children under 12."
2021-07-21 12:51:52,"We as a society are clearly not in this together anymore to fight the community spread of Covid-19 by wearing masks and social distancing.   As perverse as this sounds as someone who is fully vaccinated, it's good news that Covid-19 cases are rising predominantly among the unvaccinated because this is a path for herd immunity.  Fear in unvaccinated individuals of contracting Covid-19  will drive them to get vaccinated.  Herd immunity will go up either due to exposure to the Covid-19 virus or through increased vaccination rates.  So, as a vaccinated individual I say bring on a massive surge of Covid-19 cases to get us to herd immunity quickly while the vaccines are still working. The faster this Covid-19 surge takes place the  better before the Covid-19 virus has a chance to mutate into a vaccine resistant strain."
2021-07-21 12:57:15,I just figured it out. By letting the most extreme members of the base die off those in power can survive any primary challenges. Sad but it's the only reason to oppose vaccines.

That will reduce the burden on overworked hospital staff now inundated with infected anti-vaxxers in spike zones."
2021-07-21 13:08:45,"Not sure why breakthrough or variant COVID is news.  

We knew at the outset (if we listened to epidemiologists, as opposed to the likes of  high-school-grad Hannity),  that viruses mutate and that vaccinated people who are exposed might still contract COVID, but are significantly less likely to contract symptoms and are not very likely at all to be hospitalized or to die from it.

If you don’t wear a helmet,  get a vaccine, or do smoke, take illegal drugs, get pregnant outside of marriage, eat badly or don’t lock up your loaded gun don’t show up at the hospital expecting socialism to help you. 

We all got vaccinated against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough etc as children and there wasn’t any debate. And if you were not, you didn’t go to school or camp. All this anti government horse pucky started with Reagan and achieved orbital velocity with Gingrich. Now it is self maintaining and has spread to the Republican electorate.   The Repubs and their Pied Piper Trump are killing their own voters while destroying their jobs.  This is not new or a surprise: they attempt to eliminate Obamacare in Appalachian coal country where their voters are sick from coal derived black lung and healthcare jobs are replacing coal mining.  

So Republican “Conservatives”, if you don’t trust or want the COVID vaccines (or any other’s for that matter) please don’t show up at the hospital looking for a handout, don’t enter public places or participate in public activities.  Be free & proud: die, or not, at home, with antivaxxers."

Therein lie the utmost stupidity of placing individual right, driven by a blind ideology, over concerns for society's safety and well being.

You might think you live in civilized society where everyone behaves with decency and kindness. In reality, what you have is a large group of individuals who disregard the rest of society's concerns over the pandemic by asserting their spurious argument.

Who has spread deadly disinformation about the vaccines? Evangelical ministers in significant part.

Yesterday I happened upon a “conservative” radio station and listened to a very smooth presenter saying that we all make personal risk assessments every day, like driving, flying, having an alcoholic drink and that getting the vaccine is no different. The commentator also misrepresented data from Johns Hopkins to state that there is zero risk of death to kids, that covid is no big deal unless they have an underlying condition, and lambasted those who would have children wear “face diapers.” Appalling and dangerous.  Scalise and other Republicans in a position to make a positive difference have stood by silent foe too long. Now that they see the risk that their voters may be culled by the virus, or at least finally become aware that covid is real due to the Delta variant surge, they suddenly start trying to point the finger at everyone but themselves.

While the best antidote to the virus is obviously the vaccines, the best antidote to Republicans will be the general public observing that while vaccinated people remain healthy, unvaccinated people are getting very sick and dying. The responsible media must keep driving home this obvious fact of life - and death. While this is likely to be the most effective incentive to get the vaccination rate up, it would also be of great social benefit to start arresting people spreading misnformation - whoever they are, using the same legal framework that makes it illegal to falsely yell ""fire"" in a crowded cinema."

The misinformation that the vaccine will render them infertile or even kill them is far more powerful. And if the Republican politicians are so eager to bestow credit, they omitted the scientists who spent decades on the research that enabled the rapid development of the Covid-19 vaccine, and who began working on the vaccine well before the Trump administration investment.

I suspect that if Trump were still president, vaccines would remain unavailable to everyone other than his wealthy buddies and wealthy political supporters. Trump lobbied heavily for FDA approval, at least before the election, but had no plan for widespread distribution."

They could say, as an excuse, that the measures themselves cause harm, but the fallaciousness of this is exposed by their opposition to masks, which cause no harm whatsoever, and to vaccines, which have been shown to cause no harm to nearly all, except possible discomfort for one or two days.  The harm from measures such as lockdowns, if they had been rigorously followed, would have been limited and far outweighed by freeing us from the pandemic.

Louisiana’s Covid infection and death rates are increasing daily; two thirds of the state’s population have not been vaccinated.  Scalise received a first vaccine dosage this past Sunday after almost six hundred thousand Americans have died due to Covid-19 infections, many of them his Louisiana constituents.  And in Louisiana, as in all of the US, new Covid infections and deaths are among the unvaccinated.  Louisiana is a poor state in terms of overall health of its citizens and would have benefited from its Congressional leadership being honest regarding the dangers of Covid at the outset.  Encouraging constituents, of any political persuasion, to protect themselves via vaccination, wearing a mask and social distancing was what was called for.  Scalise chose to discourage his constituents from protecting themselves from an obviously dangerous disease; participated in the misinformation campaign.  And here we are in the midst of an infectious surge, as predicted by medical and infectious disease experts.  

Not surprised by Scalise’s embrace of misinformation and obfuscation.  This is the same Steve Scalise who’s life was saved in 2017 by Capitol Police but who  now stands by the Republican position that the January 6, 2021 insurrection that resulted in the deaths and injuries of Capitol Police was a tourist visit.

This current surge is terrible for the health care workers who have to deal with the surge of hospitalizations and death. So I’m not indifferent to them.

The absurdity of anti-vaxers makes me crazy. We are supposed to be modeling intelligence and patriotism for our kids...instead too many are modeling ignorance and divisiveness.

The fact that the deliberately negligent and grossly irresponsible Republican's are beginning to tell the awful truth, i.e., that the vaccine is needed to prevent our population and work force from being wiped out by Covid-19 and it's variants, is no reason to hand them any awards. Republicans deserve our scorn and must be marginalized for what they have inflicted upon our nation. In fact, I believe people like Rand Paul, a physician, should be prosecuted for spreading fraudulent information about vaccines. His lies will cause more deaths.

In 20202, Republican Party office holders in congress, white house, and state houses had the FACTS about Covid-19 before our nation did and they refused to take action to prevent the spread and flatten the curve. 

Under the Trump administration cold blooded Republicans called the deaths of our fellow American, “collateral damage” that was required to keep open the economy.

Where and when exactly is the breaking point in all of this?  When does one start believing the Delta variant is dangerous and deadly unless one gets vaccinated over the nonsense and misinformation their Republican leaders are claiming about how harmful these vaccinations are?

The first example should be if these vaccinations are so dangerous, then why did Trump get the vaccine?"

Re-invigorating coronavirus as it  ravage the country, forcing the Biden administration to put in place mask and social distancing a mandate once again. 

Taking the reverse of Trump's early days into coronavirus outbreak- where Trump wouldn't admit the seriousness of the virus for fear it would hurt his re-election campaign by slowing economic growth - which Trump based his re-election hopes on!

The adult male with him turned to look at me and then he joined in with the bleating. They were mocking me for wearing a mask. 

I'm not sure what sound lemmings would make but it would certainly make more sense if these lemming-like vaccine doubters would squeal like lemmings while they are plunging over the cliffs of hysteria and misinformation.

No, not one public official or spokesperson has made an error in judgment when they make anti vaccination statements to the general public. They are telling known lies to mentally vulnerable audiences while simultaneously stoking political flames into insurrectionist fire storms. These mainly political figures are knowingly, purposefully placing political hits before public safety and life saving facts. 

The plot, players, and prizes are obvious to anyone with a mind, not woke, able to think, apply basic mental analytics to discern hot from cold. In the case of COVID-19 the choices are as simple as hot from cold, day from night, right from wrong in a simple situation such as should I smack my neighbor for riding his mower at 7 am. You may feel like smacking the neighbor at 7 am but we all know it is wrong and you accept that you must do the best right thing for all concerned and remain calm; simple. 

Governmental authorities cannot mandate vaccine inoculation   and simultaneously remain true to Constitutional principles. Simple. No one will force you to be vaccinated but you may not be able to work, worship, dine, travel, or play among other free humans without that proof of vaccination.

 This is not exactly what happened. ""Senator"" Paul began his showboating by reminding Dr. Fauci that lying to congress is a crime and asking  if he wanted to withdraw the testimony that he gave in May. After an exchange of words, Fauci shot back not, as the article says, that the senator was ""spreading falsehoods."" That's not what Dr. Fauci said at all. What he said, and said truthfully, was, and I quote: ""If anyone is lying here, Senator, it is you."" And on the word ""you"" he raised his voice and stabbed his finger at ""Senator"" Paul,  who must have had his widdle feelings hurt because the latest word is that he plans to go on showboating by formally charging Dr. Fauci with lying to Congress.

Partly out of fear of their voters and partly so they can say, You see, I haven't gotten sick, so covid isn't as serious as the Democrats are saying.

Republican Trump critic David Frum said that Trump (and by implication other Republicans) can't come out for vaccination because then they have to admit that covid was more serious than Trump would allow when he pushed to reopen, and he is responsible for thousands of avoidable deaths."
