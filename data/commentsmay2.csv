2020-05-18 08:51:34,Thank you to the author and her subjects for sharing this story with us.
2020-05-18 09:46:13,"It's good to know that he has recovered.  Kudos to the hospital staff and his parents.   Now that the extreme case has been reported, the Times needs to share the actual number of occurrences and the statistical odds of such a case occurring.  From what I've read it is very rare overall, and most recover completely.  With the caution that Covid related cases are very new."
2020-05-18 10:36:10,"It frightened me when I discovered that the narrative that Covid attacked the elderly was really Covid attacks any adult. But I felt my kids - just passing from college to adults would be safe. 

And I was more frightened to find that they were not - Covid attacks young adults. I took heart in the idea that many did not even know they were ill.

And now, full parental terror. It attacks the old, the young, children, grandparents. And the people who never really got ill - school age children to young adults, may find themselves fighting to survive their own immune systems.

This is a scary beast/"
2020-05-18 10:39:49,"Thanks for sharing this valuable and detailed story. 
And thank goodness Jack has recovered. It's good to see some hope amongst the ongoing tragedy. 
I wish some of the folks urging us to ""get back to work"" would read articles like this, so that they could gain a better understanding of what is really going on. 
I am constantly in awe of the work being done in modern medicine. The doctors, nurses, scientists and other medical workers are true heroes."
2020-05-18 10:49:13,"Thank you for this detailed, expertly written and very human narrative of this particular dimension of a disease that is yet to be fully understood. So glad you are still with us, Jack! May the Force be with you."
2020-05-18 11:11:08,"It sounds like children are getting Cytokine storms. They are having an immune response to COVID-19 in a manner that is affecting the lining of the blood vessels. Hence inflammation. The blood vessels are doing things like dilation and Blood pressure drops. Also clots are formed at times from blood pooling. 
The children need a test sooner and therapy to avoid the Cytokine storm. Cytokines normally fight infections but sometimes they can become abnormally activated.  I understand because I have CRPS. The "" fire in the body"" this young man described is right on the money.  I believe KETAMINE INFUSIONS AND OR LOW DODE NALTREXONE should be explored as therapy for these children. Also Dextromethorphan is possible for an the cytokine storms.
I am a retired R.N. I admire this young mans bravery and confidence to study medicine to help others."
2020-05-18 11:18:52,"great article, great parents, great family, and thank goodness it seems he'll come through and out the other side.
besides everything else, Jack sounds like a terrific fun wonderful funny kid.
good on you, mate, here's hoping for your full recovery, and that your experience helps doctors help others too.
keep the faith.  but it sounds like you and your family have that covered.
parents - well done.  high marks to you both.  and to your wonderful doctors."
2020-05-18 11:22:42,"One of the most frightening things about this story is how carefully Jack and his family were following guidelines.  While living in NYC during this time must have been incredibly difficult, at least Jack had this extraordinary medical care and has survived.  I live in a college town in the midwest where the 3 guidelines for protection--be masked, no groups, social distancing--are increasingly ignored especially by those under 50.  So, I send articles like this one and Mara Gay's wonderful recounting of being a 30-something with this disease to everyone I know here.  But, its seems to me that without first-hand knowledge of this disease,  young people find it too amorphous to change their behavior.  I live in terror when we will have 40,000 students from all over the world descend on us."
2020-05-18 11:27:10,"I'm keeping track of all the articles I find about weird and unusual symptoms and syndromes linked to Covid-19. Because of their apparent variety and sometimes rarity, my biggest fear is that if I or a member of my family falls ill, the doctors may not recognize the symptoms or address the problem correctly in time. Considering how most cases can be successfully treated if caught in time (as was happily the case with Jack), it's important to have the database ready at hand.

I'm hoping that doctors around the world are documenting themselves and reading medical journals as this weird and terrible disease spreads, but given how completely overwhelmed medical professionals are right now and how widely Covid-19 can attack different parts of our body, I think the risk of some overworked doctors missing out on some of the most unusual aberrations of Covid-19 is pretty high. So I won't take any chances."
2020-05-18 11:35:06,"I don't understand why so many Covid 19 tests continue to come back negative when results are clearly positive. I keep reading ""after the 2nd or 3rd test"", it came back positive. Or, ""after looking the bronchial fluids"", it came back positive. Why do widespread testing if they are so inaccurate? False results can mean life or death."
2020-05-18 11:44:21,A powerful and moving fact based account. Thank you so much and thank you to Jack and his family for allowing the NYT to write about it and share it. I hope this story can and will be read by all. Shout it from the roof tops - this is real life!
2020-05-18 11:50:42,"The loss of any child would be tragic, of course, but how much poorer the world would have been if this wonderful boy had not survived his ordeal. What a great kid. And what great parents."
2020-05-18 11:57:55,"Amazing, caring family and son. I am going to watch Midnight Run in your honor.  it's on Hulu!"
2020-05-18 12:05:22,"Wow, what a great kid and family. You can really get a sense of his vibrant personality from his quotes and quips - so articulate, and at the same time so lively and youthful. It brings home how terrifying it is that even in small numbers, this virus is threatening the lives of  school-age children and teenagers who one day are so full of life, then in a matter of days, balancing on the edge of a coin flip for survival. I'm thankful for all the doctors and researchers learning all we can about the virus and how to treat it, and sharing this information so rapidly so more lives can be saved."
2020-05-18 12:05:37,"This story suggests that one of the great flaws in the initial approach was to leave those infected at home without proper medical monitoring and treatment. It appears that he was very sick and still not being treated. Reminds me of other stories suggesting that monitoring and perhaps giving oxygen as well as using proning, consistent fever reduction medication, staying hydrated, etc, might have saved lives."
2020-05-18 12:06:26,"What a wonderful, brave kid! And such amazing support from his family and the medical staff."
2020-05-18 12:08:46,"Over a month ago I was skeptical this isn’t only an elder or pre-existing disease. The media jumped on those early conclusions while I scratch my head looking at the data showing outliers. 
We don’t need Dr. Sanjay Gupta and other experts on     TV 24x7 parroting the few. 
We need to gather, understand, and continuously question the data. If only recently this attacks children then there msg be a new strain. 
Also, why use us wearing a mask if you aren’t near people? Wearing a mask in general is not good as it becomes a moisture Petri dish so you must change it often. Question, verify, question. 
What are the false positives and negatives for testing?  Anyone questioning the tests?  They only talk about how many tests. An inaccurate test is dangerous. 
Stay home."
2020-05-18 12:10:25,Strong work Jack!  Be well and have a good summer.   You deserve it.  Great Midnight Run reference.  Enjoy your family.
2020-05-18 12:13:57,"Along with other commenters, I felt limp with relief to find a happy ending to Jack's story. However, I was surprised that Jack's doctors did not test him for the virus immediately. Under our current abnormal circumstances, wouldn't it make sense to rule out the virus in all patients as a matter of course?  In today's world, the virus is no longer the zebra, but the horse."
2020-05-18 12:15:07,Love this family. May the passing years amplify their relief.
2020-05-18 12:16:43,"I am part of the Jack fan club too.  What a wonderful, funny, generous, smart young fellow -- I am so relieved he has recovered and is ok.  What a terrifying ordeal.  I am praying for all families.  Thank you for this story."
2020-05-18 12:17:23,"What a vividly written account of a truly remarkable young man and his harrowing ordeal with this terrible disease, which evidently has met its match. I was so moved by Pam Belluck's precise telling of not only the course of this frightening illness but of Jack's courage, determination, wit, and intelligence. The deep warmth and connection between him and his lovely parents is beautifully depicted. I was also struck by Ms Belluck’s detailed reporting of the demands this disease has placed on the skill and expertise of Jack’s doctors, whose ingenuity and competence saved his life."
2020-05-18 12:19:12,"Pam Belluck, thank you for writing this story of young Jack's battle with COVID-19.   There is still so much about this disease we don't know.  I hope you will continue to investigate stories of this illness and the impact on children, adults and everyone who loves them.  I think journalism like this will save lives."
2020-05-18 12:32:54,Brought tears to my eyes. So glad this articulate young man is pulling through. Good luck to him and his family.
2020-05-18 12:33:01,"Great kid with a wonderfully creative way of expressing himself.  Uses interesting imagery and unique and clever phrases to describe things.  Someone should thank his English teacher, too.  And what a remarkable thing to thank his Bio teacher.  The family seems to be the salt of the Earth. Plus they all love ""Midnight Run""...."
2020-05-18 12:35:08,Kudos to Jack’s mom for insisting the doctors look closer. Never underestimate a parent’s intuition! So glad this all worked out.
2020-05-18 12:39:25,"This demonstrates exactly why it isn't just the number of tests we do or the number per capita, it's also the accuracy. This is why we need to make sure any vaccine does what it's supposed to do before it's released on the mass market. Lord knows there are enough anti-vaxxers out there so that any issue with any vaccine will crash that program."
2020-05-18 12:48:35,"My son had Kawasaki disease at age eight, and this story brought back the visceral fear a father feels when his child's fate is out of his hands.  Even though it was fourteen years ago, in many ways it seems like yesterday. So happy Jack fought through this."
2020-05-18 12:49:13,"On May 6th, I wrote a comment in response to one of your first articles on this « new mysterious disease ». I related the fact that descriptions of this coronavirus-related illness in children were already available in Europe and the UK. In these countries, the devastating effects of the syndrome’s associated myocarditis were already recognized and evidence was appearing that the heart inflammation responded to IVIG and steroids. Clearly, the US has much to learn from the international community and should have been on alert for the arrival of the inflammatory disease weeks ago. A concerted global effort is needed if we are ever to understand and conquer this novel coronavirus and all of its consequences, all the more reason to support the WHO and political leaders who believe in global cooperation, support and exchange of information."
2020-05-18 12:56:17,Beginning to understand Covid19 can masquerade as many other medical illnesses especially in children and young adults. Definitely during this pandemic crisis there should be high index of suspicion and test aggressively if the pieces of puzzles don’t fit in.
2020-05-18 12:56:18,"Tears ran down my cheeks when I read this yesterday.  

Families with children are going to be so scared.  I would have been.  Only the most calloused parent would feel OK about their children returning to school or other group activities.

We must ALL pay attention to the needs and concerns of others again.  It does not matter WHO that “other” is.  Each person matters.  Each person can spread the virus.  And none of knows whether a stranger (or even a family member) might endure the worst this virus has “on offer” when it comes to how their body responds.

I’m 75.  He’s 14.  But each of us is vulnerable.  NO matter our age.  Or our race or financial security.

My heart goes out to all of us.  Stay safe.  And take this virus seriously.  If not for yourself, at least for everyone around you."
2020-05-18 12:58:54,"I love his reaching out to his Biology teacher.  It’s a simple gesture of thanks, but says a lot about this kid. Hope his recovery continues."
2020-05-18 13:05:22,"As a physician, Pam Belluck's piece about 14-year-old Jack McMorrow is fascinating to me . It's a superb example of medical writing for a general audience and medical professionals alike.   The balance of medical information, carefully reported and the human interest side, inspiring and eliciting emotion from this reader, is just right.  Good luck, Jack, I hope you will soon be fully recovered and no longer need the meds you now take."
2020-05-18 13:06:57,"First, Jack recovered and that is best.  Did Jack test positive for antibodies? or PCR Covid 19 infection at the hospital?  Lack of widespread PCR testing and antibody testing is a major stumbling block to managing the outbreak.  It is never made clear if Jack had Covid 19 and was asymptomatic- and if his family was ever tested for antibodies.  This is an obvious need to know."
2020-05-18 13:10:15,"I do not understand. A fever of 102 and a sore throat , several days with the same symptoms , after taking antibiotics, then dry cough, metallic taste...Why this brave and amazing kid was not seen by a doctor , in person , at that point? I cannot even imagine the parent’s desperation. I do not understand."
2020-05-18 13:11:45,"Thanks for this article, and kudos to Jack & family for helping suss this out.  

As for the people claiming it's OK to do business as usual because only people near their life expectancy are in danger - imagine this is your teenager, and knock it off with the ""What, me worry?"" attitudes."
2020-05-18 13:19:29,"Excellent Article, every paragraph connected with me, because of my similar experience. 

Three years ago, my son was 9, healthy his entire life, doing 3 sports at this time, when he came down with all those symptoms you listed, and 1 more, the skin on his fingers & toes peeled. He was diagnosed with Kawaski Disease. And they were hesitant to diagnose him, because his age. 

Every professional said the same thing, its vascular, but he's too old. Their hesitation could have could have delayed treatment,  and it is obvious the medical community is trained to believe this is an disease that doesn't affect older children,  but I can assure you,  it absolutely does. I believe this condition is exactly like Kawaski's, and the community needs to reevaluate their criteria asap. Children die from this condition every year because they delay the diagnosis, and because the damage in the heart & head is not repairable, and its heartbreaking.

I am so glad this young man is on the path to recovery."
2020-05-18 13:24:52,"This was a great narrative about a harrowing personal story for this family - -  which also weaves in observations about the disease that educate readers about the course of the disease - and what is happening.

Now a tangent-- antibiotics are often noted as being provided prophylactically,  before the viral test comes back with a definitive result.    
Anecdote: a friend developed an autoimmune response triggered by antibiotics - with symptoms including reddened skin  ( on around face, legs, feet, chest).  Note there was no proof  this was the cause - - -     only that there had been nothing else the preceded the attack. An inflammatory response.  Hers went away after about 5 weeks with no definitive Dx.   I just wonder if  - if a person is having an inflammatory response do to Covid19 - if the use of antibiotics may inadvertently exacerbate  the response...at least in some persons."
2020-05-18 11:28:45,"“...about 200 in the US & Europe and several were killed”
Amazing medical mystery and so happy that Jack is healthy again. The thing with mysteries is that they are rare. I would hate to see this syndrome used as a rational for keeping kids out of school. Jack’s story illustrates that almost total isolation will not keep people safe from this virus. We all must take precautions & calculated risks."
2020-05-18 11:56:07,I love this kid! Appreciate his and his family's generosity in sharing their story as well as contributing to Covid-19 science and educating the rest of us.
2020-05-18 11:59:49,"Woodside for decades was an Irish enclave. There still are Irish bars in the area, but I didn't think any Irish were still raising families there."
2020-05-18 11:01:12,"So glad Jack pulled through. What a special kid. His ability to articulate for doctors his ailments and symptoms, even in the midst of excruciating pain, will undoubtably assist in the effort to characterize this scary new syndrome. Superbly written story!"
2020-05-18 10:28:57,Jack - we’ll never forget you.  Or what your parents must have gone through.  The photo of the dad/son hug is worth more than money could ever buy.
2020-05-18 12:01:42,The pictures of this young man belie the belief many hold that only disabled or out-of-shape young people are being attacked by the coronavirus.  He and his family have done a useful public service by sharing this terrible time in his life.
2020-05-18 11:30:12,"The cytokine storm just doesn't remember to shut itself off after the battle is over... Case: SARSCoV2 attacks any spot of your body but also left your Immune System confused. After it is gone, the body starts to attack everything. Ergo, not only you need a cocktail to prevent the coronavirus replication, stimulate the immune response to the viral attack and heal the damaged parts of the body but also to a timer to shut off the defense system to fight phantom attacks. No doubt why people pin hope on a vaccine which will prevent the whole chain cascading to start but what if the extreme clever bug starts to mutate...."
2020-05-18 13:17:21,What a profoundly puzzling virus this is. One that infects bats etc. apparently to no ill effect. How little we really know.
2020-05-18 13:22:39,"A wonderful story, throws up more questions than answers of the system of current practice of curative medicine.

May be its high time to consider rest of the world borrowing best of Indian system medicine Ayurveda whose emphasis is on the immunity buildup and improvement, not just curative. 

Corona virus epidemic is brutally opening up the fault lines in curative Western approach to human health. It’s the health care given for medical conditions where a cure is considered achievable. Curative care aims at preventing the appearance of diseases “through pharmaceuticals and such techniques as immunization, exercise, proper eating habits and other life style issues, and from palliative care, which concentrates on reducing the severity of symptoms, such as pain”. 
 
Excessive use of bactericidal in the name of hygiene and lack of constant interaction with nature and other organisms has gradually made immune system weaker, even though our overall health and lifespan has increased.

Ayurvedic concepts are related to immune system functions, concept of strength, resistance to illness, preventive aspect of immunity function related to digestive system balanced doshas or bio-energies, through cleansing, are also essential for proper resistance to illness."
2020-05-18 13:26:12,"A beautifully written and artfully balanced piece. As a parent of 2 teens, I just keeping thinking, ""The more you know..."" A heartfelt thanks to the family for sharing their story and to Ms. Belluck for doing it justice."
2020-05-18 13:32:17,"With the exception of the fever, the symptoms associated with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome sound very similar to a severe food allergic reaction resulting in anaphylaxis.  Both involve a massive immune inflammatory response. Pam Belluck - has anyone asked these pediatric patients if they suffer from food allergies?  I am wondering if kids with severe food allergies are more prone to suffer from this inflammatory syndrome when contracting COVID-19."
2020-05-18 13:33:14,"This is a very nice article. I believe mine and others  fascination with it, is the fact that during this pandemic we have had very little of this specific information about cases and the spread of covid-19. It appears that privacy laws have shackled that a bit. As a doctor I am more and more amazed at how this corona virus pandemic in humans appears more and more similar to a corona virus illness in felids. Feline infectious peritonitis is an excruciating disease of cats.  There is an effective vaccine used in outbreaks. Felines that contract this viral infection have mixed results and a much worse mortality and morbidity rate. However the viruses attacking of the serosal surfaces in cats seems very similar to what was described in this article as having happened to Jack.  Lets all hope the disease doesnt progress in this way any further."
2020-05-18 13:35:58,This is the first article I've read that relates a first-hand experience with this serious inflammatory condition. Thank you to the family for sharing their story. All the best to Jack! And thank you Pam Belluck for this extremely informative and moving article.
2020-05-18 13:36:38,"If children exhibit symptoms that seem to fall in line with this, can blood work be done to see if inflammatory markers are high? It seems if it can be caught early, there would be less risk of devastating results or long term damage to the heart. If so, that would be a huge help in early identification."
2020-05-18 13:41:35,"Beautifully written, harrowing tale with a blessedly happy ending. What an amazing love story this family and this writer have graciously shared with us. Wishing every one of them continuing good health and happiness. And, Jack, I hope someday you will become a physician - you would be awesome!"
2020-05-18 13:42:19,I’m very glad things turned out well for Jack. Kudos to all the medical pros who persevered here. One thing I’ve heard is that younger people who vape or have vaped might be more susceptible to getting ill with the virus. It doesn’t say in the article whether Jack vaped or not (and I’m not insinuating he did). I’m just curious and wonder if the doctors addressed this and asked him about it. It might have been a good thing to include in the article.
2020-05-18 13:42:27,"This was well-written and informative, but misses one important piece of the puzzle: the role of the primary care pediatrician in the delayed diagnosis. In a child who has been sick for 10 days and shows up in heart failure, someone has missed something profound, and it almost cost this child his life. While telemedicine is being lauded as a revolution, this case should be viewed as a cautionary tale. In many,many cases a doctor needs to see you and examine you not just to make a diagnosis, but even to know how worried to be. The fact that this pediatrician “prescribed antibiotics” without a single test or exam just highlights the issue. A follow up article on all the morbidity and mortality resulting from primary care physicians not being willing to see their patients in person would be a worthy undertaking."
2020-05-18 13:46:06,I’m not convinced this is related to coronavirus. Just because they test positive doesn’t mean it is related. This is especially true since some patients didn’t test positive for an active infection but only for antibodies.
2020-05-18 13:50:19,"Pam Belluck, thank you for your important work! I was in tears reading about Jack's journey and all that he and his family has been through. I am so so glad Jack pulled through!  I'd love to read a follow-up, if possible, and if the family needs any help, I'd love a way to donate."
2020-05-18 13:51:44,"Thank you NYT for these stories that showcase the human aspect of this devastating virus.

We want the daily hard stats it's so important to hear from the covid victims and survivors...please, at least one per day.   

Fear of the unknown is debilitating.  The more we know the different ways  this virus affects various individuals the more prepared we can be... and perhaps motivate more people to heed the mask and social distancing guidelines.

So happy Jack made it through!  Bless him and his whole family."
2020-05-18 12:08:45,"Well done Jack! I particularly applaud your note to your teacher.
I expect your ordeal will do a lot to educate the medical world as to how to treat these symptoms."
2020-05-18 12:34:14,"Everyone that thinks they know everything (it's just like the flu, social distancing is a waste of time, etc.) about a virus that just escaped from the wild a few months ago, is too arrogant to know that they don't know, or to be merely equal.

Belief is thinking that you know because you want to.
Science is knowing that you don't know, but that you can use sample data to know there is a high probability that the population falls between two numbers. Science is only knowing what you have to know because you have cancelled out other possibilities.
Science is what you use to keep children alive.
Belief is what you fall back on if they die.

Those that reject reason (math, logic, science, and the agreed upon facts that they create) and seek to replace debate and voting with political violence (shutting down debate to hold the government hostage, making it difficult or impossible for many to vote, etc.), refuse to be 'reasonable people with whom we happen to disagree.
The Constitution is based on the logical arguments that the Founders and citizens have, after we threw off the political terrorism of the crown. The Right misses the political terror, is against political equality for all citizens,and thinks they can use the government to bend us to THEIR will.

Do you hear any Trump supporters calling out unmasked terrorists that brought guns into state houses and screamed at security to terrorize lawmakers? Of course not. That is how they think government is supposed to work."
2020-05-18 14:12:57,"Please share more about the genetic testing doctors are pursuing. It seems to me that blood tests for antiphospholipid antibodies would be a worthwhile angle, since overactive immune response is suspected. What is the genetic marker that doctors are hypothesizing could exist here? Please share. Thank you."
2020-05-18 14:20:01,"I'm thrilled the kid is alright. I'm older now and prefer these stories that end on a positive note - at least in this specific case. 

As a father of three young kids it gave me real piece of mind thinking that children would be spared from this. It's a bitter pill for that thinking to change. 

And Midnight Run is a terrific movie for those who haven't seen it."
2020-05-18 14:20:57,"This virus has new surprises every day, it seems. Please continue reporting the latest discoveries. It will become endemic, so the more we know about it, the better we wil be prepared for the ongoing infections."
2020-05-18 14:27:02,"Sounds like a great kid. So glad you made it through, and that you had such a great team of doctors. Bravo!"
2020-05-18 14:34:50,"This article is a perfect description of the gross deficiencies of telemedicine. Prescribing an antibiotic and later steroids without a physical examination or lab tests is poor medicine. Referring him to an urgent care center on a weekend also was not a good idea. Even though this was a new syndrome and hard to diagnose, he should have been seen by a pediatrician or referred to a children’s hospital emergency room days earlier. 

Best wishes for a complete recovery!"
2020-05-18 14:39:52,Jack I am so glad you are well. What a horribly frightening ordeal. I think the cautionary tale is that it’s better to get to the doctor and hospital sooner than later. I hope you have continued good health and a full recovery. Your future seems bright!
2020-05-18 14:51:14,"Is this one virus or many? It seems to do so many different things. 

I've heard that rhinoviruses and influenza favor the airways because they have difficulty living at body temperature, and they rely on the cooling effect of air. 

COVID-19 appears to have no such limitation, and will happily infect places that are normally untouched by respiratory viruses. In addition to the usual rogue's gallery of respiratory symptoms, it can infect organs, cause rashes and stomachaches, and who knows what else. It seems to grow more capable almost every day.

What is it that we're up against here?"
2020-05-18 14:52:41,"Thank you to the NYT  for allowing us to be aware of this  young man and his family ordeal , plight and recovery. May he be safe in the future and also his family members. Excellent reporting."
2020-05-18 14:55:22,"So happy this ended well for Jack and his family! You seem like a great kid Jack, and to paraphrase you, I became very “emotional” while reading this well written account of your ordeal. I am glad you had the strength, support and courage to pull through and to share your story. Stay healthy, and I hope your dad and I will be able to get back to work soon! (I don’t know him, we just work in the same industry—on different coasts!)"
2020-05-18 14:41:12,and that's how the next generation of amazing doctors and medical professionals are born!! Go Jack!! just the story I needed to read today.. one of hope and an amazing young boy!
2020-05-18 11:32:06,"I found myself rooting for Jack! He is a great young man and I have confidence that he's going to enjoy life and Pay It Forward too... maybe in both the medical and the acting worlds? 

As the grandmother of 2 youngsters, I was absorbing every little detail of Jack's symptoms and saga. Great journalism. Fabulous parents and doctors who really, really paid attention.

Go Jack!"
2020-05-18 13:55:29,"Jack has a lot going for him, not least his fighting spirit, he should do well in life."

2020-05-18 14:37:19,"The pain parents endure when their kid suffers a potentially life-threatening condition is unfathomable. It was very painful for us as strangers to live through Pam Belluck’s chronology of what this kid and his loving family and committed medical team have gone through. The photos were painful to view, particularly the “hug”.
To “moron” one, “moron” two, and their parents. Get through this
nightmare, emerge  healthy, celebrate life.
Pam, please follow up this story. Give us a happy ending.
Thank you for happy tears."
2020-05-18 09:36:33,"A remarkably courageous young man ...and a family who lovingly got him where he needed to be....  Jack survived because he got the kind of medical care that counted and counted fast...!  
There's little doubt that there is much more to this 'virus' than meets the eye.  But with the kind of help Jack had, they'll find their way through this, whatever it is.  
Your publishing the story, NYT, will certainly help.  This syndrome in the wake of COVID-19 is additionally concerning as it is ironically striking the opposite age group we focused so much of our attention on, our young....  not that we old-timers don't matter - we all do.  But truthfulness will certainly get us closer to solving our problem - let it flow...  we need it desperately!"
2020-05-18 15:04:54,"So glad Jack is back. His idea to do more now that he has his life back is the gift of knowing how fragile life is, even though it has come at the expense of innocence."

2020-05-18 12:34:40,"Excellent article, Pam Belluck."
2020-05-18 13:51:12,This story ought to be a wake up call for the CV19 deniers. But then again many of them don't really read. Maybe someone can read it to them in that case.
2020-05-18 12:19:59,How about some college/med school offers Jack a scholarship??
2020-05-18 10:56:37,"For a time when it seemed that only the elderly suffered the adverse effect of COVID, it was easy for some to dismiss the virus as a ""boomer remover."" 

Now that the young seem to suffer as well, albeit in smaller numbers, I suspect that the devil-may-care attitude of those who think ""it's just like the flu"" and that we should ""open up already"" may change. 

Sad to say but many people are selfish, caring only about themselves and their kids.

I wish Jack well and thank the family for sharing their story."
2020-05-18 11:47:01,"Jack and family—you’re beautiful!!!! I’m so glad you are healing. I was very moved by the love of this family. And the photography. 

(Also agree that Midnight Run is excellent lol!) 

Love you Jack! 
JACK LIVES!!!! 
HOORAY!!!!"
2020-05-18 10:47:19,"What a great kid! And I say that with all respect! Beautifully written and articulated by Jack. We are all in this together. Much like 9-11 triggered a lot of young people to join the military, this pandemic is going to trigger a lot of Jacks to turn to careers in medicine, front-line response, etc. And we’ll be the better for it."
2020-05-18 12:58:21,The Times should print a tear-out listing the symptoms of this childhood covid-19 disease so parents know what to look for.
2020-05-18 15:07:37,Jack. You are a good man and you have the most wonderful parents. So happy you made it through. Bless you and thank you for being in this world.

2020-05-18 11:49:46,We apparently don’t care enough to do anything when a crazed gunman bursts into a classroom and guns down 22 children in cold blood. This will do nothing to change the anti -lockdown mindset that has now infected us along with the covid virus.
2020-05-18 13:05:40,Beautiful 14-year-old and family. Jack can be Captain America and my guess is he will be.
2020-05-18 14:25:56,Congratulations Jack!  And follow your dreams.  I will keep your dreams in my heart too.  Never give up.  You know how to do that now.
2020-05-18 15:09:19,Thank you Jack for sharing your story. Hopefully it will help our Governors make sound and safe decisions as it relates to opening our schools.
2020-05-18 13:52:25,"Jack, you are an inspiration and a a really cool kid. You emailed your biology teacher? What an amazing thing to do during a time when no one would have faulted you for thinking only of yourself. And to Doris and John, way to fight to keep your son's case in front of the medical teams. (And way to go raising an outstanding child(ren) too.) This is a beautifully-written article that really sheds light on the horrors of this wretched disease. Be strong Jack. You and your family are in my prayers."

2020-05-18 13:59:43,You are so brave Jack.  I hope you continue to get better.  You have a wonderful family.
2020-05-18 09:46:10,"Thank you, New York Times, and to Jack and his family for bravely sharing this vital story. With more harrowing real life documentation of this terrible disease we have, I would hope some of those claiming ""hoax, listening to the voices of armed science deniers, would feel at least some doubt. However, facts and true stories don't seem to matter to the true members of the Trump cult.

I sincerely worry that Jack's family will be harassed by the same trolls and cruel  ""protesters"" who seem to be emerging out of the slime all over this country."
2020-05-18 13:24:39,"I wish Jack full recovery. 
There's been many reports of young people, children, teenagers, suffering from various complications of Covid-19 infection.
Young people having strokes, children having Pediatric Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome, in other cases it takes weeks or months for young people to recover.

There's been some new idea getting traction recently:
""Human Challenge Trials for Vaccine Development"". 
<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/11/1752/5814216"" target=""_blank"">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/11/1752/5814216</a>
Basically you administer vaccine to ""healthy"" young adults and some time later you infect them with live virus. Half of study group gets placebo and then it gets infected with real virus. 
How is it ethical? Obviously we are just discovering long term sequelae of Covid-19 infection. Do we really want to subject young people to strokes and myocarditis?
I hope that even in our current rush to develop vaccine, we are going to drop this idea and use old-fashioned strategy to test our vaccines and medications for Covid-19."
2020-05-18 12:21:06,"I am so glad Jack recovered. This article highlights how mysterious and unpredictable this illness is. He took all the prescribed precautions and yet he somehow contracted covid. Given his age, we also assumed he would not be greatly affected by this illness. No other family member has it. How is this even possible? When I see pictures of people in Wisconsin cramming in bars without masks celebrating their “freedom” I am scared. We have not even ridden out the first wave of the illness."
2020-05-18 09:45:31,"Very well-written.  The subjects, Jack and his parents,  truly conveyed their situation and feelings, and the writer captured them incredibly.  Jack: stay well.  Parents: you are amazing!!  Writer: You've won a Pulitizer, and I hope you keep on providing us with the results of your talent."
2020-05-18 10:43:24,"In much of the developing world, such a condition would be a simple death sentence."
2020-05-18 12:53:16,"My heart goes out to Jack and his family, as well as all the other children and their families. Thank goodness we have such good health professionals in New York."
2020-05-18 10:56:12,"Very good piece on one of the ways Coronavirus takes no prisoners, attacks any and all, and how doctors working nearly blind despite a barrage of tools finally figured it out. But this piece is a warning to all parents and kids that they are not immune to the virus. Here in Paris I see kids and teenagers playing in the streets as if nothing is happening. Something is happening and it's not good.  But bravo to Jack, his family and the doctors who worked tirelessly to find a way through this.  Hearts and minds will succeed.  Thanks for the piece. It's a light in the dark."
2020-05-18 13:14:27,"Jack sounds , all at once, like a typical teenager, while wise beyond his years. Such a great story of family love! I'm sure we will be hearing great things about Jack in the years to come-best of luck for a full recovery, and for the path ahead."
2020-05-18 09:51:36,So glad he's OK ...I hope his experience helps others.
2020-05-18 13:47:49,Thank you for sharing this information. It helps all of us be more aware. Very thankful to hear Jack is going to be ok.
2020-05-18 12:57:55,Jack should write rock music. He's more than a rock star and his descriptions of his pain are visceral and lyric!
2020-05-18 11:00:04,"Such a well written and gripping piece. It is the epitome of engaging, informative, and narrative journalism. Jack is also so eloquent with contemporary metaphor and so engaged in the process. Such a moving piece. I’m so happy it turned out okay for Jack and his family."
2020-05-18 12:41:59,"Way to go, Jack! Your strength is inspirational."
2020-05-18 11:37:37,"Glad to hear of Jack's recovery, but I'm afraid that when the parents get the hospital and medical bills, it will send THEM to the hospital with cardiac arrest!"

2020-05-18 14:05:41,Best wishes for Jack and his Fam.  Thanks for sharing your story.
2020-05-18 08:51:32,"A happy ending to what must have been a most terrifying experience for Jack and his family. My very best wishes to you, Jack, for a complete recovery, with no lasting damage. I feel sure you’ll have a wonderful life from here out, having stared down death at such a young age. You fought and you won. Your doctors were brilliant, and so are you."
2020-05-18 13:16:54,"Firstly thank god the young man survived.
Changing the subject i would like to pass on an account of my best friend for over 51 years who for 5 weeks fought for his life.

It started with a cough and severe headache then came the breathing difficulties. No sweating. Pain then travelled into my right arm then into my feet losing the feeling in my toes.
Next it affected my nose making me feel as if it where running but in fact it was dry. Then wax started running from my ears.

During this time i told my wife to go to the post office and get a form for a will.
The fourth week i told my wife to get an ambulance because i believed i was going to die. Breaking down she begged me not to go it was then i resigned myself to die. After 5 weeks i began to recover. The only medication i took was paracetamol and one aspirin a day.
5 weeks later i phoned him today he is back at work laying concrete floors.  Remarkable. He is 64yeard old."
2020-05-18 10:50:57,"This boy, this almost man, did a lot of growing up in dealing with his Covid experience.  What faith in himself, God, a higher power, to bring his body and sweet soul back from a terrible brink.  I am so happy for him and his family for making it through a terrible ordeal, a parent’s nightmare."
2020-05-18 15:20:40,"This is a new virus and presuming to know how it affects people without the facts of how it does has lead to conclusions that prove to be untrue. This should be no surprise to anyone. The knowledge we have about living things and semi-living things like viruses is discovered by observation and estimation and confirmation. 

What sober people need to understand is that people who cannot wait for facts to consider what to do are just not considering consequences but acting to just see what happens, like running full speed in complete darkness through an unfamiliar place."
2020-05-18 14:07:12,"The hubris of humans is astonishing. We tamper, interfere with  and manipulate nature and are continually amazed that things don’t go the way we think they’re going to. From climate change to disease processes our primitive brains have only scratched the complexity of what is out there and what is happening. Only thru realizing how little we know and being humble as we approach these processes will we keep from digging our hole deeper. Good luck to this family."
2020-05-18 14:30:47,"Couple thoughts from a dad who has been through a son's decade long battle with leukemia/relapse/stem cell tx/viral pneumonia while immunosuppressed/ARDS/cytokine storm/double lung transplant. 
My first is to ask that docs reconsider the dictum ""when you hear hoofbeats, think horses not zebras"" which is their way of diagnosing from the most familiar/common before considering the most radical. That approach nearly killed my son a couple of times. Continuing the metaphor: if you aren't certain you are on a horse ranch, think zebras. Narrow from ""life threatening"" first; don't assume it's a runny nose. With COVID, we are not in Kansas anymore Toto. 
Secondly: there may be two disease processes, not just one. 
Third: cytokine storm/hyperinflammatory conditions. It's what is thought to have killed most flu patients in the 1918 pandemic. Good work is ramping up on it now re: COVID. 
When I brought it up with the docs when my son's lungs were failing, 6 years ago, I got blank looks. Now, fortunately, it's well known but not yet contained. It would seem odd to want to partially suppress the immune system in the midst of COVID but in fact it may be a useful approach. If you have someone you know with COVID, don't be afraid to ask the docs about how they might handle it. You may get raised eyebrows, but a) docs are not infallible and b) you need to be an advocate. 
PS: my son starts med school in the fall."
2020-05-18 14:41:47,"What an articulate 14 year old!  I'm thinking that he should run for President....on second thought maybe being articulate isn't required anymore...

Good luck and stay healthy, Jack.  I think you could make for a great doctor.  I hope to read about it someday."
2020-05-18 14:11:22,"It is bad enough that as a ""society"" we have decided to open the economy at the expense of what was believed to be the elderly and infirm.

With the virus now turning its rage toward the younger population, are we really considered a ""civilized society"" if we are willing to turn a blind eye to Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in favor of the dollar?"
2020-05-18 14:16:59,"This is worse than the symptoms adults have, in my mind. As a parent and grandparent I would gladly take the pain and suffering so the young would not be subjected to it. God bless the children and keep them safe."
2020-05-18 09:19:25,"Thank you for sharing Jack's story. I now know what to look out for with my own children. I'm so glad he was able to get into a hospital that looked deeper and out of the box for the cause and solutions!!! I'll be praying for Jack and all the other children to have a complete recovery and no lasting effects. In my 40s I had heart failure from a bacterial infection. I recovered 100%. I believe they will too!!! Although this experience had to be so scary and traumatic for Jack (and his parents) it was heartwarming that he now feels led into exploring the medical field. He is a wonderful person and I can't imagine how great it made his teacher feel when he took the time to thank them!!! Loved that you were so thoughtful!!!  Way to go, Jack!!! You are a admirable young man with a kind and generous soul!!!"
2020-05-18 10:11:03,"It took two days for the urgent care center test results, which showed negative.  The hospital turned up only positive for Post-Covid antibodies.  Common Sense, clearly wandering around America without anyplace to alight, suggests the workings of this disease remain largely still unknown. Doctors, virologists, and research scientists are working like crazy, around the world, to figure out how it works, how it is passed along, how it targets human bodily functions, how it can be thwarted, combatted, vaccinated against.  The amount of unknowns, still, is so alarming it’s a wonder any team of doctors has enough tools in their toolbox to keep anyone alive, never mind, the numbers of victims filling ERs and hospitals right now.  The world is full of wonderful and terrifying mysteries and I, for one, am in gaping awe of those that know even a little something about the inner workings of this virus.  Kudos to everyone of Jack’s team that figured this out."
2020-05-18 09:11:38,"This Virus is almost perfect in how it deals out Death and destruction and people want to re-emerge from quarantine? I cannot understand. This kid may need a heart transplant and he will be in the healthcare system for the rest of his life! No one is talking about the chronic disease survivors of this virus will suffer. Those who die don’t tell the entire story. There are thousands more who will need chronic care for serious lung, heart and kidney disease. Most people don’t know, for example, that people who survived polio are often struck with renewed symptoms from post-polio syndrome. COVID19 will leave similar scars. For goodness sakes this virus isn’t the FLU!This all in a Country that scoffs at affordable healthcare."
2020-05-18 09:35:52,"We've had about 100 cases I believe here, mainly in the part of London where I live. I really value this long and fact-packed article, because none of the coverage I've read has expressed the true horror of the disease so unforgettably. Thank you so much for raising our consciousness. Good luck to this boy and all his family."
2020-05-18 10:59:49,"Jack sounds like a wonderful person with a great future. It was impressive that he thought to thank his teacher for the biology lessons. He seems destined for great things. As frightening as his experience was, it is a blessing that Jack's doctors learned so much from it and a credit to them and to Jack's resilience that he survived. It is not how long we live that is important, it's that we learn from our living and use what we've learned to help others. Well done, Jack. Our future will be in the hands of your generation, and you give us all hope."
2020-05-18 10:36:26,"As a parent this article terrifies me, and brought me to tears.  I am overwhelmed and overjoyed that this beautiful child survived.  I hope science will follow them for research purposes as this pandemic moves forward.  Too many children have not been so lucky.  All the best to this family."
2020-05-18 15:28:50,"Bless you and your family, Jack, for sharing your story. Rest, heal and keep medical school in your sights. You’ve got the tenacity, intellectual curiosity and smarts to succeed at whatever you choose.

P.S. Midnight Run is one of my favorites too!"
2020-05-18 15:33:47,"Well that brought me to tears.
Glad he pulled through.
I'll teach you Stairway To Heaven!
Start in A minor on the fifth fret."
2020-05-18 15:34:34,"Way to go Jack! You are strong, tenacious, smart, and compassionate. You will make an excellent physician. As Captain American said, ""You get hurt, hurt 'em back!"" (The germs, of course.) ;D"
2020-05-18 15:46:20,"What courageous young man, and family. Just so uplifting and a well written story. Jack...I wish  you and your family all the blessings in the world. And I hope your father will get his job back!"
2020-05-18 15:24:52,"Awesome story of survival, this virus is wild! The twists and turns and multiple vectors of attack. I am sorry that we have an administration that resists science: there is so much we could be learning through global engagement of scientific inquiry and documentation to prevent the next case."
2020-05-18 16:07:38,"This disease seems to have so many variations, so many surprises.  I believe that doctors should start to consider Covid as a possibility in any case presenting with upper respiratory symptoms of any kind."
2020-05-18 15:56:40,Terrifying. I wish Jack and his family well.
2020-05-18 15:54:33,Contrast the dire situation described here with pictures of all the teens out in the malls that corporate-politicos think it's so important to open
2020-05-18 16:00:52,"Jack you rock!! Your story should be on the night stand of every pediatrician, NP, PA and ED physician as it provides a  roadmap for diagnosis and treatment. Wonderful story for all of us who have been in the shoes of your parents as there is nothing more terrifying to experience than watching your child's life hang in the balance. Highs fives to the medical folks, your parents and you - now get back on that guitar guy!!"
2020-05-18 16:06:16,"Wow! Talk about a brush with death! Mysteries upon mysteries is what comes up for me about Jack's illness.

Aside from the question about how he got the virus and the fact that his family did not is interesting. And then, the odd result with testing (came back negative after waiting two days) and then the hospital does its own test and gets a positive result, must have been super frustrating for the Docs and the family.

Finally, massive dose of steroids brings the inflammation under control, and Jack survives.

Talk about flying blind. However, even if the Docs were able to diagnose Jack with Covid19 sooner than later, it is unclear that medical authorities would have known what to do. Jack was lucky to get to a hospital that could help him, and his father was not turned away (as other families have been when loved ones end up in Covid19 ICU).

I wonder if Jack would have benefited from an infusion of convalescent plasma; or, a mass infusion of high dose Vitamin C over the course of a few days to boost oxygen in his blood (they used this in China)? 

Obviously, having other therapies to still a raging virus would be useful.

And for all the joy of Jack's survival, there is multiple expressions of grief for those not so lucky. Good luck Jack with a full recovery!"
2020-05-18 16:12:55,"The implications of this case and of others where children have gotten sick for reopening the schools are enormous. Children can get this disease and it affects them in ways very different than their grandparents, but no less terrifying and life-threatening.

Can you trust Trump to think about this? Can you trust Governor of your state, the Mayor of your city, or your state Supreme Court, to think about this? Can you trust that the instant experts on TV will not undermine the true experts?"
2020-05-18 16:12:32,I'm so glad to hear that this young man made it through.  I wish him a full recovery.  We had all hoped children might be spared - this is a warning that we can't let our guard down against this monster virus.
2020-05-18 16:15:21,"It would be helpful to know the false negative rate of tests that are being conducted across the country, presently. It is unnerving and maddening to continue to hear reporters, physicians, governors, epidemiologists etc... discuss testing protocols, supplies, % of pop tested, fever checks, and then no mention of the fact that there may still be a very large false negative rate among tests conducted. Along with pre/asymptomatic transmission, this should receive constant and consistent articulation in the press---especially as we end lockdowns, and go back to (mostly) business as usual. Additionally, there appears, still, to be no single strong and unequivocal messaging about the importance of EVERYONE wearing masks."
2020-05-18 16:18:18,"I am so happy that this beautiful boy survived. His story is frightening and compelling. One can only wish him a safe future, whether he becomes a doctor or plays one in film. What a face he has!"
2020-05-18 16:20:18,"I'm glad the doctors were able to apparently learn something from this boy's ordeal. I do think it could also be very important to properly hunt down how he got the virus, and why no one else in his house got infected This virus is almost universally considered to be more infectious that that."
2020-05-18 16:23:18,"Governors, for the sake of the children, please base the decision to reopen schools on the evidence! There's obviously a genetic component to this syndrome that is currently unknown. Accelerated, thorough research is needed before risking children's lives!"
2020-05-18 16:21:34,"Interesting that Jack’s parents and his sibling, although having been repeatedly exposed to the virus through Jack, did not become ill. Scratching my head. Does anyone know why?"
2020-05-18 16:15:19,"What a great kid!
And what a terrifying ordeal and illness he endured,
and yet his indomitable spirit and sense of humor shine
 through it all.
May all good things come to you, Jack."
2020-05-18 16:29:00,"What a lovely story of perseverance and healing. It's a blessing he survived.

But here is the thing. He only developed symptoms a month after his last day of school, and it's unclear how he became infected.

With large numbers of children in school in NYC, what will be the policy in place regarding opening the schools and preventing infection?"
2020-05-18 16:32:22,"What a fantastic story! So happy Jack made it through!
The next time I hear somebody say that Covid-19 is just like the flu and we shouldn't be worried about it I am going to give them a spontaneous ice-bucket challenge.
Whatever this new virus is, it is NOT your garden-variety flu."
2020-05-18 16:29:56,"What an amazing guy this Jack is. I loved this story, I loved the amazing team work of physicians and nurses, the involvement of Jack and his parents, and the humility and even the humor shown by all in this nerve wracking episode of just a single individual's struggle against this novel coronavirus.

Jack is the brilliant future of this country. Keep going, young man!"
2020-05-18 16:33:32,"I just want to remind parents that if you don’t feel safe sending your child back to a classroom this fall, you might not have to. Homeschooling is an option.  Research the requirements in your state, and fee free to talk to other families for ideas about how to make it work for you."
2020-05-18 16:34:46,"As a parent and now grandparent, this article brought an awareness of the fact that we are opening this country much too quickly.  There are too many factors that we are missing that could crop up on us that we are just not aware of and could surprise us as they did in Jack's case.  We need to look into this case and that which is afflicting our children.
During this pandemic I suffered two bouts of angina.  They symptoms were eerily very much like Jacks as the pain shot through me as if it was lightening; I thought it was the virus.  I was terrified. It was deemed occlusion and a stent was put in.  Thank God.   What does a child feel when it is not a coronary problem because of age or lifestyle?  We don't know.  We need to research.  We need to be a lot firmer in our decisions to stay safe in our communities.  We are going back to life as we know it much too soon and our children could be suffering because of our rash decisions."
2020-05-18 16:33:37,"Although but a snapshot of one life, through Jack's quotes and the author's description of his personality, I sense Jack is a special kid with a sense of humor and a heightened sense of self-awareness. I would wish you luck with life's endeavors, Jack, but I am confident you won't need it. Luck is required by those without other means."
2020-05-18 16:38:23,"This is an amazing story and a tribute to the efforts and work of our healthcare providers.

However, I have this gnawing feeling that I would not in any other advanced country - what about the bill?

It would be interesting to follow up on this boy’s care - as bill after bill will inevitably come due."
2020-05-18 16:44:18,"Thank goodness that Jack has survived such a terrible ordeal.  He's been through a lot for such a young boy and it seems that his spirit is intact.

And how fortunate for him that he was born White and in a family that's relatively financially secure.  He had a whole medical team to care for him.  I wonder if a Black/Brown child would have had the same care.

The comments here are so supportive.  No insinuations that Jack and his family has done something to 'deserve' his illness.  No quoting statistics about gun violence or welfare.

Jack certainly is a lucky boy."
2020-05-18 16:45:04,"Terrifying and wonderful at the same time. Much luck and health to this young man and his family. 

What interested me most was that his family tested negative for covid. I am presuming they conducted the PCR test. Do they all test positive for antibodies? It is a bit suspicious that it took such difficulty to test for the presence of covid in Jack. Could it be that the lab has contaminated the sample? The hospital must be teeming with covid at this point in time. In 2005, in New Haven, they pinpointed a possible suspect for Kawasaki. A human corona virus that caused mild illness, but in a few children caused PMIS. Could it be that contracting covid, predisposed his body to a more serious infection by HCov NH? A Japanese company, Takeda manufactures polyclonal antibodies that help the most with Kawasaki. Better than just steroids. 

What worries me even more is that medical researchers and doctors seem to be gasping in panic at pathways that should have been predictable. That is the most alarming aspect of this. If you follow the biochemical pathway of Ace2, every symptom in severe covid will seem like a normal unraveling of that RAAS pathway. I sincerely hope this is simply loud news and not researchers blinking like deer in the headlights."
2020-05-18 16:58:30,"The range of complexities of this disease and our bodies' responses is staggering. On rare trips to the grocery or for takeout, the world looks and acts normal except for our masks and distancing. We must repeatedly remind ourselves to remain vigilant in the things we do automatically. Wash, wipe, and dispose of the tissues."
2020-05-18 16:57:14,Excellent piece.  Very well written.
2020-05-18 16:49:21,"“I just want to do more with my life now that I have it back,” he said, gesturing with his Captain America shield.""

After reading this terrifying and heart pounding article, Jack's closing sentence made me cry.  Not just because he survived the most frightening 10 days of his life, but because of the attitude and focus he carries with him because of his life threatening ordeal.

Suddenly, that gloom and doom I've been feeling for so long is beginning to lift because of what this young gentleman not only went through, but learned from and the direction in which his heart and mind are going in.

Somehow I don't think the world has heard the last of Jack McMorrow.

May Jack have a full and complete recovery.  The very best to him, his parents and his siblings.

Thank you for sharing such a beautiful, important and poignant story Ms. Belluck."

When are we going to wake  up to the fact more testing and different kinds are critical to our survival?"
2020-05-18 17:04:02,"Three weeks after a trip to NYC in EARLY February our family began experiencing stomach pains that defied explanation, unrelenting night-sweats, throbbing eyeballs and EXHAUSTION. But without the high fever and shortness of breath, we were left guessing? Further research of symptoms had me convinced we most likely had Covid; but, because confirming it wasn’t possible (no fever, no test), we just lived with our suspicions and made sure to keep inside. Fast forward a ‘recovered’ month when, all of us started noticing an intermittent reoccurrence of our symptoms and, new ones that are even scarier-hubby can no longer complete his normal cycling ride without feeling like his lungs are on fire, my never-smoked/vaped 18-year old ended up in the ER twice, only to have the doctors scratch their head when her SEVERE pain upon taking a deep breath and elevated d-dimer numbers were left undiagnosable, when her CT scan came back clean. My other daughter’s face developed a red zebra stripe down her nose, her scalp felt like it was on fire and her toes started blowing up with PAINFUL angry-looking blisters and, even THEN, we couldn’t get tested for even antibodies, because we don’t (didn’t ) have a fever??!!!! 
It’s obvious we are on our own in this; with no clear path to when it’s safe for us to go out in public OR, what all this means for our long-term health???"

In rheumatic fever, which followed an infection by hemolytic streptococcus, antibodies to a bacterial product were present, there was no sign of the organism. 

The fact that this is appearing in children older than usual for Kawasaki Disease would seem to indicate the requirement for a more mature immune system."
2020-05-18 17:23:28,"This is the equivalent of school shootings: if you don't invoke the innocent youth, you can't generate mass sympathy and political currency.

“…[CDC] made its first definitive statement last week describing a rare but disturbing condition in children related to Covid-19. Doctors in the U.K. first reported in April a spike in previously healthy children presenting with features similar to another rare condition, Kawasaki disease…

“…This is a reminder of how much we don’t know about Covid-19…

“…Yet such data on patients isn’t being streamlined and shared with the public quickly…CDC hasn’t been filling its traditional role of promptly publishing medical findings that may help doctors care for patients. Instead, a lot of this information is being passed around social media, by email or even through word of mouth…

“…To take one example, the latest evidence is that blood clots are a frequent complication of Covid. The disease seems to activate platelets in ways that doctors are only beginning to untangle. It’s likely that some patients who seemed to need ventilators to breathe instead developed big clots in their lungs… 

“…Studies from the Netherlands and France suggest that clots arise in 20% to 30% of critically ill Covid patients…

“…Doctors have become more conservative in putting patients on breathing machines…The traditional way providers have used respirators can damage lungs that are inflamed from infection.

“…What’s more, some of the severe organ damage…may be the result of the body’s immune response to the infection…"

I am not sure why covid 19 is scared to touch these ""peaceful"" enforcers who breach social distancing .. the only way to fight this ""flu"" called Covid-19."

2020-05-18 17:57:50,"Articles like this are one of the reasons I subscribe to the NYT. Thanks, not just for the humanity of the piece, but for the detailed, informative reporting--and photos."
2020-05-18 17:47:13,Go for it Jack! After this no where to go but up!!
2020-05-18 18:27:41,"Dear Ms Belluck. Thanks for this informative article regarding the new pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome which has similar manifestations to  kawasaki  disease.
 Please share with your readers if young Jack received high dose intravenous immuno-globulin G ( IV IgG) and aspirin  which have been the standard  treatments for  kawasaki disease for many years.  
There may be new  registries and clinical trails for this new  pediatric disease associated with SARS CoV 2. 
It is important to know what really works because  in kawasaki, perhaps in this new syndrome as well,  the earlier the treatment is started the less risk of long term sequel  like coronary artery dilatation."
2020-05-18 18:39:02,"Jack's case most likely represents viral myocarditis caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus (but almost any human pathogenic virus can sometimes cause myocarditis). This type of myocarditis is a condition where either the virus attacks the heart, or an overactive or misdirected immune system attacks the heart, or there's some combination of the two. 

It's way too early to know for sure with this virus or this case, but fulminant viral myocarditis often has a good prognosis for complete recovery. I know of kids whose hearts failed and needed up to full circulatory support for some number of days but then made full recoveries over weeks to months. 

This case was definitely scary and life threatening but hopefully ends well. What remains scary are the reports of COVID positive people suddenly dying at home, the reports of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (some with coronary artery damage), and the large percentages (mainly adults) with heart involvement reported from Wuhan, China."
2020-05-18 18:38:07,"Wishing you a speedy recovery, Jack!  Great things await you in life."
2020-05-18 18:45:54,What a beautiful boy and a happy positive ending.  He has a new lease on life and his situation will help others understand this terrifying virus.
2020-05-18 18:48:34,"This kid should be a doctor, a writer AND an actor. He's so funny and articulate in his descriptions of symptoms and response to the virus. When his doctor told him if he didn't stay in the hospital he would die: “I would say that scared me to death, but it more scared me to life. It scared me to fight as hard as I could.”
Jack is an inspiration as are his family and doctors. The one thing that bothers me is that the doctors were slow to test and retest, which I read over and over and attribute to the dearth of tests caused by the foolhardy folks running the federal government."
2020-05-18 19:07:39,"Jack, 
Thank you so much for sharing your story. It's so important that people know about this possible reaction to COVID-19. I was inspired by your courage and humor and your family's profound love.  I also really appreciated that you allowed the reporter to describe the details about your symptoms and how you were treated. This is a public service. Thank you! All the best to you and your family. I'm sending healing vibes to you through the NYT comment section!"
2020-05-18 19:13:36,"Kudos and gratitude to the McMorrow family, who are generous and brave enough to have their story documented, and to aid the doctors in researching this disease and its effects."
2020-05-18 18:59:36,"This story is well written and I am happy Jack has made it through the worst. That being said, I feel that the title and the message or theme on Covid19 is entirely too presumptuous at this time, especially for the few who have had such violent symptoms. There is little scientific data to go on why a presumed otherwise healthy isolated teen would have the reaction he had. I agree with another who mentioned anaphylactic shock as it would be hard to rule out a severe allergic reaction to the antibiotics as well. Steroids make sense alone for that, yes he may have had Covid19, then because of the prescription for Antibiotics, everything got worst. Please do not attempt sway people to an agenda of fear, as fear leads to anxiety which leads to panic (Consequently, it also leads to more shares and hits on your story/website) Author, it should be your responsibility as a writer to not incite panic. Give all the facts you can, but leave out speculation as just because he had Covid19 doesn't always prove it to be the Catalyst for his health worsening. Thank you."
2020-05-18 19:04:49,"Can someone work through the timeline of exposure, symptoms, testing?
Was the first Covid19 test a false negative?  If not, when did Jack get exposed?  Did he have a three week incubation period?  Was the group of kids admitted with the same symptoms from the same school or neighborhood?  
Are these kids asymptomatic early on and developing these symptoms much later?
There are too many unasked and unanswered questions in this story.  
I’m so glad Jack is recovering from this terrible experience but we need more investigation by the writers."
2020-05-18 18:54:57,"Very very glad to hear that Jack made it.  Steroids:  Not just for breakfast anymore.  Seriously-- I am going to channel Trump here-- I rode out a case of the 'Rona at home with Steroids, prescribed by my doctor for the inevitable asthma exacerbation.  Steroids kept my lungs from getting too bad.   I am grateful to my doctor for being proactive.  As an aside to Jack: do whatever your heart tells you to do, for a career, but-- kid, you have amazing eyes."
2020-05-18 19:00:06,"Covid-19 is a terrifying illness -- it's like a medusa -- which head will strike a person -- the one that attacks the lungs, the one that goes after multiple organs, the one that produces clots and strokes.   The fact that we have a  president in denial about the horror of this illness and who is urging opening of businesses, sports, etc. is equally horrifying especially when we are nearing 100,000 dead which will more than likely occur by June 1 is literally criminal.   
Trump must be removed by whatever means in order to end his calls for people to literally run into the jaws of this devastating illness.   He is literally urging people to kill themselves so that and his cronies can make money."
2020-05-18 19:46:16,"Lucky boy, and good for him and his family.  We continue to learn what this virus has to teach us.  So, good for the doctors and nurses who all continue to help us overcome this.  And for those who are impatient for us to ""open up"", please, pay attention.  Yes, we should open up - but only very, very carefully."
2020-05-18 18:24:45,"This article did not contain the numbers that I need to understand the severity of this infection.  How many per 100,000 have been infected?"

2020-05-18 20:27:21,"It is surprising the doctor(s) were considering sending him home after concluding he may be suffering from mononucleosis.

What about the sudden drop in blood pressure? Heart racing? how do they explained those things away?  Perhaps an immunologist would have interpreted these symptoms differently.

Jack is fortunate to have parents who can advocate for him and the doctor(s) were willing to listen.  Would the doctors be willing to always listen regardless who the patient is?

Hopefully doctors are beginning to realize we are individuals and our body is not going to behave exactly the same way when faced with a pathogen, especially a new one.  The symptoms as well as the immune system response are not going to be the same for everyone.  Hence the need to start thinking outside the box and be more nimble in their response."
2020-05-18 20:52:39,How much can we trust the tests? It seems like there are a lot of false negatives.
2020-05-18 20:56:44,Incredible story. Loved hearing Jack's voice throughout. So glad he's on the mend.
2020-05-18 21:16:59,"This was a miracle. I am happy to see some positive stories during this negative time. I think this article is an insight to show that we really do not know everything about this virus that is spreading. I hope that doctors around the world are sharing all the information they are receiving with their patients. A major fear of mine is that the doctors will not know all the symptoms of this virus and other sicknesses that are coming along with it. They won't whether or not to treat certain things or by the time they figure it out, it will be too late. In Jack's case, I am glad that the hospital and doctors found what works and were able to treat Jack back until he was healthy enough to go home."
2020-05-18 20:24:44,"All the best to you and your family, Jack!"
2020-05-18 21:21:45,"Jack appears to have had the classic symptoms of SARS-CoV2:  fever, dry cough, metallic taste in the mouth, pain/difficulty breathing, stomach ache.  Following that, Jack’s body appears to have generated a cytokine storm, confirmed by the fact that the steroid treatment was successful.  

Of course I am thrilled for Jack and his family, and so happy the doctors, nursing staff, lab workers, etc. were able to work together to save Jack.

Parents must be vigilant in watching for the above-mentioned symptoms of the virus and attendant cytokine storm, and seek medical help for their children as early as possible.  When in doubt, do it!"
2020-05-18 20:48:34,"I am incredibly happy that Jack is okay and that his Mother implored the hospital staff to keep him longer and they listened. 
It is scary as a parent to experience something like this.  I hope when brown children show up with the same or new symptoms, they aren’t sent back home but are given the same level of diligent care"
2020-05-18 22:31:10,A good family remains intact. May future complications be short and mild. A thank you email to a biology teacher - priceless. Jack has immense social intelligence - and a good vocabulary for describing pain.
2020-05-18 22:10:40,"Jack is an amazingly articulate young man. The phrase ""a throbbing, stinging rush” would never have entered my mind when I was his age. He also seems to have a wonderful relationship with his parents. The whole family is an example to us all."
2020-05-18 20:20:09,"I think they should reflect on what might have caused his infection of covid. Without knowing more dteails, please be careful of elevators, buttons, laundry rooms, door handles, washing machine buttons and in fact all common areas, as long as you step outside the confines of your home, your child should learn not to touch any public surfaces with bare hands, and certainly not his face at all. 

In this day and age, learning how to keep ourselves safe requires a constant re evaluation of danger spots and refinement of our own actions."
2020-05-18 21:17:11,"Thank god this poor kid is on his way to recovery.
To the writers: I know we're getting new information every day -- could you elaborate on what it means that it's a ""new Covid syndrome""? I assumed that meant the conclusion was that it was caused by COVID, but then as mentioned, the majority of kids with this have or have had the virus, but not all.
Does that mean it's potentially a correlation (something like compromised immune systems?) rather than specifically caused by the COVID virus itself?
Or is the current medical theory that in fact all children have had it  and the ones who've tested negative for the virus and antibodies are simply testing errors? I had been assuming that was what it was until yesterday when the Times reported that of the 137 cases in NYC, only 66 had tested positive for the virus or antibodies. (Seemed quite low... And if they all have had it, what a grim portrait of the accuracy/false negatives for the tests being used... But wasn't clear from the article if maybe some children hadn't gotten results back yet? Would be very helpful if it could be noted if all results are known.)
I know information is scant, but would really appreciate any clarification on these type of numbers in future articles on this terrifying new syndrome. If you have the opportunity to talk to doctors, this information could be tremendously helpful for us.
Thank you as always for your reporting, especially during these awful times."
2020-05-18 22:54:46,"This is beautiful story with a ending that let's any parent sigh in relief.   I wish every child had parents of such diligence and hope their faith has continued to provide comfort.  This article also is NYT at its best--thorough, well written, informative and awareness raising without any additional motive or bias.  Well done all.   Be well Jack.  Thank you for sharing!"
2020-05-19 00:27:04,"I'm so glad to hear that Jack is at home doing tremendously better. It saddens me when I hear someone comparing the Corona virus to the flu and dismissing it. This story shows how dangerous this virus is and how it can affect those of different ages differently.

Many of the symptoms and medical issues Jack experienced is very similar to those experienced by Lupus patients.  I know his physicians will be following Jack closely."
2020-05-19 00:51:19,"I experienced similar things with both of my sons here in Toronto. They are 5 and 8 years old and had high fever and extreme sickness for a long time. I had to take them to urgent care more than once and the youngest was finally even admitted to hospital via ER. They  both had pink eye and red swollen lips and the youngest one an extreme rash. In 2 different hospitals they were under suspicion of Kawasaki disease but finally it was „just“ another inflammatory over reaction. The younger one was swab tested for covid - negative, but never for antibodies! It was in beginning of March so there were almost no cases in Toronto. But he was tested positive for the flu! So maybe they both already had covid and got the flu on top what made them react like this... will be interesting what they will find out in the future! But it was and still is really scary!"
2020-05-19 01:52:00,Thank you for this wonderful story. We need to hear the ugly part of this disease. I just wish more people lucky enough not to experience such an occurrence would not minimize the gravity .  Please understand every life is precious and should be respected no matter the age or political color.
2020-05-19 01:53:08,"Thanks to the author and family for sharing their experiences.  It would have been easy to  describe what happened to them all without also sharing their feelings and related needs.  It took a lot of courage for Jack and his dad to be open about shedding tears and breaking down with emotions, and others who are going through this or will go through it in the future will benefit from their demonstrated courage, grace, motivation and expressions of appreciation."

2020-05-19 04:06:41,"We have to be careful assuming that Covid 19 is the cause of this syndrome.  Hand sanitizer and cleaning products use is unprecedented in an attempt to prevent the spread of Covid 19, yet it is possible that this prevention could be the cause of this syndrome.

Hand Sanitizer has been linked to an increase in enterococcus bacteria (IE super bacteria) that can affect the heart.

Kawasaki Disease has a statistical association to carpet cleaner (although causation of carpet cleaner to Kawasaki disease is still unproven).

We were not meant to live in a sterile and germ free environment and am afraid this attempt to over clean our houses and stores is doing more harm than good."

2020-05-18 15:34:07,"Kano Nigeria is a city I have visited numerous times. 

Like all of northern Nigeria, pick just two words: massive corruption. Then add more words: ignorance, denial, poverty, illiteracy, religious fanaticism.

Add a global pandemic to the above and you have a perfect storm. No lessons will ever be learned. 

A lot has already been said and written about Nigeria's corruption and how it has ruined what would have been one of the world's greatest nations. 

What is surprising though, is that Nigeria has not completely fractured into many different pieces -  despite incompetent government, ethnic and religious strifes, theft of trillions of dollars in oil revenue, crime, electoral corruption, etc etc.   

Pretty sad, considering that the large Nigerian diaspora constitutes the most educated group in the US, surpassing all other groups including Asians and native-born Americans. I personally know dozens of Nigerian doctors and nurses joining the fight against COVID-19 here in the US. They would love to help out in Nigeria, but are handicapped due to all the aforementioned."
2020-05-18 18:23:54,"Institutionalization of democratic values, where elected leaders have the incentive of elections that somewhat reliably reflect the will of the people--or else--is what Africa needs.  Not that the US is so great in this regard, but an educated electorate is the insulation of a strong democracy, and it's hard to procure and sustain.

My heart goes out to all African nations that don't have strong democracies and public health systems.  It's America's shame that we're so dominated by an ""America First"" president--indeed, the whole nation is riven with either xenophobia or egocentrism.  We might actually earn our self-annointed reputation as the greatest nation in the world if we paid more positive attention to places like Nigeria."
2020-05-19 00:38:55,"As a young man who recently underwent the compulsory Nigerian National Youth Service Corps Programme, I camped in Kano State for 3 weeks. The city is big and steeped in history. Unfortunately poverty and illiteracy is also highly prevalent. Coupled with a current state governor that is average at best, but can more accurately be described as Inept, my deepest fear is that tireless efforts of states like Lagos and Abuja who have done relatively well in trying to combat Covid-19 in their domains, people feeling Kano state to other states in Nigeria might unwittingly spread the virus across the nation.

The Coronavirus has shaken us to our core, but together we can overcome it. Africa's richest man, Alhaji Aliko Dangote hails from Kano State as well as Illustrious Nigerians like the Former Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, (who i am proud to say that we are both alumni of Kings College, Lagos). Therefore Kano state can draw from much needed intellectual and financial support to overcome this. Hopefully, religious, and cultural factors as well as institutionalized corruption which for so long as held Nigeria, and much of Africa back from progress would hopefully not get in the way this time of Kano state being able to effectively contain this virus, and chat a bold new future for the great Emirate.

Long Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 

And Hopefully we get a Vaccine real soon. 

Thank you. Oriola."

He and his administration continue to deceive the public, dismiss the severity of the pandemic, disregard scientific expertise, dither on any national planning, and deflect responsibility onto the states, China, the WHO, and anyone or anything other than Mr. Trump."

This is definitely worth investigating."

With Y2K the alarms were sounded years before the event happened.  And organizations spent the time and money to do what they had to do which ultimately led to Y2K being a non-issue.  

With the pandemic, unfortunately, people in positions to do something about it early ignored the warnings and we ended up with a medical and now fiscal disaster.  Thankfully, for the moment, the reaction actions taken has slowed down the virus and its impact.

But like Y2K there are going to be people who see what is happening now (with Y2K it is the people who say the effort was not needed by pointing at nothing happening as opposed to acknowledging the proactive effort that made it a non-event) and dismissing the need to stay vigilant and continue to practice the common sense safeguards. 

I do think things can be opened up as long as the proper precautions are taken but I fear that there will be too many people who think we can go back to living as we did in February.  And we will be right back to late March and possibly worse."

I am therefore continuing to self-quarantine and to do everything possible to avoid going to a doctor’s office, dentist’s office or clinic, or undertaking any elective medical process or procedure. In a true emergency I would of course do otherwise.

However, I find that my attitude is common among my friends and colleagues of similar age, which bodes ill for hospitals, clinics and health care professionals whose income stream depends on a steady flow of patients.

I have been getting reminder calls from my doc, dentist and other providers urging me to come in for one or another service; there is a long pause on the other end of the line when I tell them I will schedule a visit after a coronavirus cure/vaccine has been developed.

I have enormous respect and empathy for all my providers, especially given the paltry payments they get from Medicare. However, when it comes down to my well-being vs their cash flow, my health and survival take precedence.

To put it another way, I haven’t been to a grocery store for almost 3 months and have my groceries delivered instead. If I won’t go to a grocery store, why would I ever go to a hospital or doctor’s office? That’s where all the sick folks are!"

Clearly, in the future there needs to be better organization among all hospitals. It needs to be formal and not ad hoc. But neither the mayor or Gov. have addressed this directly. Having one hospital in each borough of the city as a central intake might have helped. The question is will health care think outside the box or will it just go back to the way things have been. I see no evidence of any rethinking of the model. Liberals like to blame everything on insurance companies but the problem here is with the health care system and the people who run it. Medicare for all is not going to solve this problem--because good or bad it will allow the present medical system to remain in place as is and not force change."

Part of that is betrayal.  To walk into the hospital and know that your death won't matter, it won't change anything, you'll be called a ""hero"" when really what you wanted was to protect and be protected in turn.  To know that your managers have retaliated against you for speaking up, that your family may never understand or want to, that your children will carry the stigma as well.  

When I look at all of those purple-top wipes sitting on the shelf in the video, I feel envy.  I want to sock them away somewhere so I'll have them when I need them, like people who've known starvation keep hidden food just in case.    

I hope so much there is a truth and reconciliation committee for how this happened.  Robust pandemic response - because this isn't the first pandemic in my generation.  Maybe the next one is consistently airborne and has a much higher mortality rate.   An example of ""No more water but fire next time.""

The percentages of Hispanics, blacks and Asians in leadership need to represent the community they serve. This is the elephant in the room that is not talked about.

2020-05-20 14:34:46,"Yes, HCQ is useful in the treatment of lupus, malaria etc. But where did the notion that it might be useful in Covid -19 cases come from? We all get bright ideas. We've all said ""Eureka"" at some time in our lives, and we've all been proven wrong. That ""gut feeling"" is not enough. Where did the manufacturers of HCQ get the idea for its use in Covid-19? Trump sometimes refers to data from France. That is the one source I do know about. There, an alternative medicine doctor, and a climate denier, is the darling of the rich inhabitants and visitors to the Côte d'Azur, who love his promises of eternal youth and youthful energy. They keep him in funds and in a well-appointed lab facility. He also is a major owner of the journal in which he publishes his results without peer review. If Trump's politicization of the drug gets in the way of real research, we need to ask where the impetus for that research came from, for there is no logical reason to expect that it will be useful. If it proves to be useful, well and good... but what a shot in the dark. I'd rather see trials of acyclovir and many other proven anti-virals."
2020-05-20 14:27:39,"There may be another reason Trump is enthusiastically embracing a malaria drug known as hydroxychoroquine.

Last month, THE NEW YORK TIMES reported Trump’s family stands to benefit from widespread use of the drug. According to the report = If hydroxychloroquine becomes an accepted treatment, several pharmaceutical companies stand to profit, including shareholders and senior executives with connections to the Trump , who himself has a small personal financial interest in Sanofi, the French drugmaker that makes Plaquenil, the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine.

According to Trump’s 2019 Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Reports filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, the 45th president’s three family trusts each have two line item entries describing investments between $1,001 and $15,000 apiece in the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund.

So, three family trusts each have two line items of up to $15,000 on an international stock fund that has about 3.3% of Sanofil which means a total investment of 3.3% of $90,000 or $3,000 stake in Sanofil.

These latest studies result from a mix of Donald Trump declaring a drug to be effective against COVID-19 and doctors who are desparate for something to treat infected patients. This mix has distorted our science and the modern methods used to develop drugs.

I won't be surprised if we learn that Fauci was ordered to launch his study by the White House and that all of these hydroxychloroquine studies ultimately show no effect or harmful effects on patients. Then we can test the effectiveness of tonic water versus ginger ale on viruses."

The media's hysterical and reactionary portrayal of this drug as dangerous (when its side effects are generally mild and well known), lacking in scientific merit (when HCQ was found to be a potent inhibitor of SARS in 2005), and financially lucrative (when it is a low-cost generic) have eroded any lingering faith in the media's commitment to the truth."

but the gold standard of clinical trials -- a double blind study, in which neither the patient nor the administering doctor know whether drug or placebo is being used in each case -- means that the patients would not be informed about the drug being tested.

the mere fact that a patient believes they *might* be getting a specific treatment is enough to bias the results. (robert rosenthal documented this astonishing effect back in the 1960's.)

the observational studies are useful but not conclusive. and the conclusive studies will require that subjects are not informed about the specific drug being studied. it's that simple."

Everyone make sure you catch this.  It is not the President that is hampering this research.  It's the mainstream media that has actively mischaracterized it's use and safety profile in their coverage of the drug, primarily driven by a constant oppose Trump agenda, that has overly scared people of it.

They constantly cite the questionable VA study to say it's dangerous without ever reminding the public that this same VA gives 42,000 doses a day of the same drug to veterans for RA, Lupus and other auto-immune diseases... every day.  Does that sound like the VA medical system is scared of using it?  It is a very safe drug, taken at home by thousands each day for years.  Will it help with Covid?  Maybe, maybe not.  And if CNN, MSNBC et al will shut up trying to beat it down just because Trump touted it, maybe the medical scientist will be able to figure out the answer."

2020-05-20 17:41:21,"Testing of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat COVID-19 should continue, and it is. 

Several weeks ago, the FDA granted ""emergency use authorization"" for HCQ and chloroquine phosphate to treat severe COVID-19 cases. Also several weeks ago, a doctor in LA reported that HCQ, by itself, doesn't help, but that HCQ taken along with a zinc medication caused all of his COVID-19 to go from severe symptoms to no symptoms at all in 10-12 hours. Other studies have tested HCQ by itself and report the same results (i.e., by itself, HCQ has no effect).

Why would we NOT continue to test hydroxychloroquine, especially along with a zinc medication? Isn't our goal to find some treatment or vaccine? Maybe HCQ will be it; maybe not. 

I don't plan to rely on Trump as my doctor, but if the medical community concludes that HCQ is safe (we know that already) and effective, why NOT use it?

Hydroxychloroquine has been used for many decades to prevent or treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some patients do show negative side effects, especially those who have heart problems. Those same potential side effects exist for patients who use HCQ to treat or prevent malaria, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. If a patient's doctor knows or suspects that the patient has heart problems, presumably the doctor prescribes some other medication to prevent or treat that patient's malaria, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. The same could and should be done here."

If the tested drug doesn't ""work,"" it doesn't matter much whether a trial participant is promptly told whether the participant received the tested drug or a placebo, but it obviously matters a great deal if the tested drug ""works.""

I have previously taken a 90mg dosage of Hydroxychloroquine for years without side effects. The doses so far used to treat Covid-19 seem to have been closer to the malaria doses, based on what I have seen and what side effects have been reported in the media, like with Tom Hanks and his wife. If I were Trump's personal physician forced to give unproven medicines to the President, I would have given him as low a dose as possible of both the Hydroxychloroquine as well as any antibiotics (like maybe doses meat for kids). There is no theory what the dose should be, as I think there are no scientifically plausible mechanism of how the drug would act. But if other people take much higher doses than the President, adverse effects would be inevitable. But no one seems to pay attention to this, even though dosage is one of the most important aspects of any medicine (especially for side effects)."
2020-05-20 19:28:10,"I once took  Mefloquine, an anti-malarial ""sister drug,"" (CDC*) of what our often-unthinking President is using as protection against the Covid virus. FYI: malaria is caused by parasites; viruses enter the cell, change the DNA, then rapidly replicate. 

According to medical, rather than wishful-thinking, websites, some side effects of Mefloquine are hallucinations and insanity, which I suffered during the third week of taking the drug. This was really unpleasant but reversible; hydroxychloroquine, on the other hand, is sometimes used off-label for rheumatic conditions, not viruses. In test cases, neurological damage from overdoses (appropriate dosing is unclear for off-label use), is irreversible. These include unpleasant brain-induced body sensations, partial or total, blindness, and death- not insanity yet, as with the chemically similar Mefloquine. 

I wondered if the President got a stock deal from Big Pharma to lead the public in this direction for financial gain (no financial disclosure yet). Maybe he is feeling helpless, ready to try anything. Regarding permanent insanity, no offense, with him, I'm not sure I would know the difference. 

From CDC:
""Hydroxychloroquine ...has the potential to produce permanent symptoms of neurotoxic vestibulopathy including tinnitus, headache, dizziness, vertigo, disequilibrium, paresthesias, ocular disturbance and neuropathy.
The mechanism of hydroxychloroquine-induced neurotoxicity is thought to be similar to that of mefloquine..."""
2020-05-20 18:49:59,"This potential treatment was unfortunately over-politicized.

Just like much of this coronavirus outbreak.  

And on top of that, the narrative changed so frequently that most of us were whipsawed by revisionist messaging from politicians and pundits. 

Are travel bans prudent or not?  Do masks work or not?  Are we trying to flatten the curve or crush the curve?  Is the virus dangerous to children or not?  

You can google news to remind yourself of the furious response to Trump's China and Europe travel bans just to recall how every policy move was greeted with automatic opposition."
2020-05-20 22:05:33,"Like so many things Trump has said this ""I'm taking it"" in reference to hydroxychloroquine is nothing but noise and is so typically the Liar in Chief. After hearing, nothing more than that, some weeks ago that this drug might be useful in treating patients with covid-19 Trump switched his bull horn to max to promote the drug. This was of course countered by medical experts. As in the people who know! What now? Trump announces he is taking the drug to affirm his earlier position. Where is the evidence? Under this president the States of America, the U has already been deleted are heading for the abyss."
2020-05-20 22:12:38,"Neither Trump nor the media have been careful enough about having a scientifically based balanced message. First, HC has a very long safety record of prophylactic use on millions of people, when prescribed by a competent MD: very few drugs have been used as broadly for so long with virtually no severe negative events or fewer contraindications. Second, large randomized double blind studies are necessary to understand the prophylactic efficacy when used prior to hospitalization or symptoms: these have started, and the news media should just wait. Third, the FDA has approved the drug for other uses and has agreed that the ""off-label"" use for Covid is at the discretion of the prescribing MD. Thus, Trump and his physician are perfectly in correct in using it, and in being transparent about it. The best advice is to reserve judgment rather than jump to conclusions now. 

Those that pretend to know the scientific answers now, or jump to ridiculous characterizations of Trump, will look pretty silly if and when the well-designed large scientific studies prove that indeed it is safe to prescribe (w MD) for most of the population and it is an effective prophylactic drug that prevents the infection or that reduce it severity. We should all be wishing the best from these studies: there is zero scientific evidence today that, when properly prescribed by an MD, there is large risks for the patient. If there was such a risk detected, the current studies would then be immediately stopped."
2020-05-20 23:55:21,"“It’s gotten a bad reputation only because I’m promoting it,” the president added. “If anybody else were promoting it, they would say it’s the best thing ever.”

2020-05-21 01:48:36,"I still don't believe he is taking the medication. This brouhaha is doing exactly what the Occupant of the WH wanted, distraction from the real issues.

Most Lupus patients take 2 200mg tablets per day.  From the studies on use of the drug for treatment of Covid-19  used more than that.

It's interesting to note it takes 2-3 months for Lupus patients to see an effect from the drug. So taking it for a few weeks at a low dose makes no sense. 

Also when the use of Hydroxychloroquine was first brought up as a treatment for Covid-19 many Lupus patients could not get their prescriptions filled or refilled so I do hope this does not happen again.

BTW insurance does not pay for medication the is off label use and this drug is not yet approved for treatment of Covid-19."
2020-05-21 02:57:00,"We all know, or should admit we know, that Trump lies so much and so often that it is irrational to believe anything he say!!"
2020-05-21 03:21:51,"Talk about burying the lede: about a dozen paragraphs down we see the real reason researchers are having trouble finding test subjects:

""In a draft letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association, obtained by The New York Times, members of a research consortium complained that “negative media coverage” of hydroxychloroquine — in particular the studies showing it might have harmed hospitalized patients — “directly correlated” with a drop in enrollment in trials run by institutions including the University of Minnesota, the University of Washington, Columbia University in New York and Henry Ford Hospital.""

It's not Trump who's the problem it's the ""negative media coverage"" that's scaring people off -- committed by Trump's media opponents. Obviously something Ms. Stolberg fears admitting, or she wouldn't have grossly misrepresented things starting with the first paragraph.

Fact is, this childish campaign against hydroxychloroquine -- a drug safely used by millions for decade -- has now gotten in the way of science. And all because of Trump hate. Nice job, haters.

Even the state unemployment insurance has made their applications deadly.

Even those assigned and paid extra to make sure employees are following instructions, do not it themselves when not on safety duty. And not only do employees at these warehouse facilities ignore the constant reminders to wear masks and maintain distance, they talk all the time while working ignoring the fact that coughing and sneezing is not the only way to spread the virus. And worse, cleaning crew close bathrooms for cleaning between shifts forcing employees to crowd the only bathroom open. Therefore, irresponsible workers who do not believe how serious this pandemic is and ignore instructions are the ones that put everyone at risk."
2020-05-19 11:24:46,"It wasn't just jigsaw puzzles and cases of pop which Amazon had orders for and delayed.  In the early days, it was orders for masks and filters and air purifiers for people at home on Safe at Home directives.  These items took a month to arrive and in some cases were ""lost"" or became ""unavailable"". The day that my many mask orders from Amazon arrived was wonderful.  Since I also purchased street-suitable masks from ETSY, I had several to give to family and friends.

Obviously Amazon as a company let me and many of its faithful customers down, not just by raising the prices of its games to entertain quarantined children, but by not having a good plan to distribute necessary supplies for citizen quarantine.  There weren't many resources to get masks and filters for street wear when local purchasing was not possible.

We are regular users of Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save""program which combines orders for one monthly delivery such as for our canned cat food and kitty litter.  It is also the time of year which we start to build up extra supplies for Hurricane Season so our suppliers aren't overwhelmed.  We were notified very strictly that our monthly orders for canned cat food and litter were ""excessive"".  Why that extended to Kindle orders is still a mystery to me.  I have transferred my cat food and litter orders to Chewy.

Thank you for presenting the stress and the trials of workers at Amazon trying to fill all the orders.  Your article offered a necessary perspective."
2020-05-19 11:47:58,"Karen, great reporting. There has been a history of continued, horrific conditions across amazon warehouses for years. Dig back into around 2012 and you’ll find how Bezos refused to put air conditioning into warehouses where temperatures often reached into the 100’s for months during the summer, and employees were fainting from heat exhaustion, until a source threatened to take to the press. All the while, those of us working at HQ sat comfortably in air conditioned offices in Seattle. 

Pure greed, arrogance and instilling absolute fear in their culture, has been, and continues to be, the driving force behind Bezos and his absolute lack of conscious. As the saying goes, the fish stinks from the head down."
2020-05-19 11:48:21,"I think sense of balance and fairness is important. The stock price of Amazon does not directly drive true company profit from its various businesses. Customers who patronize amazon businesses contribute to its revenue and thereby its profit or loss. 

People have to be willing to be conscious shoppers and support other businesses. The convenience, product availability and prices compel a lot of people to shop from Amazon. But then, the same people can't complain about local brick/mortar businesses floundering, amazon not paying sustainable wages, environmental destruction, workers being monitored for their performance and bathroom breaks etc. 

Amazon is great for once in a while shopping, but not go to for everything if and when there is a convenient alternative at a physical store another online store. 

Conscious consumerism creates conscious business models and a conscious society."
2020-05-19 11:53:17,"If one does the research on Amazon's response to the pandemic worldwide one can find much the same story. Insufficent safety measures, often late, and then not properly applied on site followed by statements from the company which contradict the facts on the ground. One example is the closure of four of Amazon's most important warehouses in France by the French government because of safety fears."

2020-05-19 12:14:59,"OK, I agree with several threads here, but also some context.   Many companies were and still are struggling to adjust to the Covid outbreak and implement safety measures, not only because of availability of protective equipment, but also because of shifting guidance from public health authorities.   This story makes it seem like some huge, negligent coverup.   The article cites 100 people at the facility with the disease.  Out of how many?   It cites 900 out of 400,000 globally - .225%.   Both numbers are certainly wrong, but not evidence of some out of control facility.   
Writing an article critical of Amazon is guaranteed click bait, but at least some perspective would be helpful.   How many people at your workplace have gotten Covid?  Does your employer report that number?   How has your employer's processes to make it safer evolved as we learned more.   Amazon has many opportunities to improve, but let's have some balance in the reporting."

What is needed is a new and exiting name for a region that has gone into the warehousing business because of its location in the transportation system.

And maybe they are right.  I hear complaints from friends shopping at big box stores that safety precautions are not being taken.  At many places, wearing a mask or gloves is voluntary, including for staff bringing items to a car for roadside pickup. That seems to be true for postal workers, too. We have no firm national guidelines for the workplace or other situations.  One thing I've noticed on Amazon lately is price gouging.  I was able to find something directly from the company for less than half of what was being charged on Amazon.  I also ordered something that never came on time because it was still in China.  When I complained, the third party supplier begged me not to mention it online and offered to give it to me for free if I changed my review.  I think this has all been a learning experience.

We have adjusted to worrying nonstop about Ashley's lack of coding ability at age 4 while spending zero time thinking about the ever-growing threat of nuclear war or the other pandemic-level-certainty that carbon burning will ensure Ashley's life is over by 2050, latest--at least any us-like life, and I'm talking about the privileged, here.

Constant travel makes no sense from so many angles It would be far more efficient if the delivery system was set up for twice a week deliveries.

He claimed if the number of cases climbed, it was because we were finally getting tested, not because he opened up the economy. That is not true. He did not require us to wear masks either. And of course testing after the economy opened is too late. What’s the point in getting tested if no one is quarantining anymore? 

Now case numbers are going up even though few people are testing because there is no point in testing if we have to work anyway. Contrary to the governor's promise that we would close if the cases went up he opened businesses even more quickly than he promised. Now we have more cases and deaths. It's all about the money."

I've worked at Amazon for eight years, with a front seat view to all of this because of the organization I am in.  Ive seen first hand and been a part of the efforts to implement safety changes in our FCs to protect workers.  These efforts started in earnest much earlier than the article claims, especially with a huge reallocation of resources in tech organizations to begin implementing changes that would enable associates to social distance. Well before the timeline this article claims, Amazon was soliciting ideas internally from both it's corporate and warehouse associates for ideas that could be implemented to enable social distancing, and actually working to implement them.

What the author doesn't understand is that a company the size of Amazon cannot simply flip a switch and have everything be perfect over night. Changing the behavior, software and physical layouts of hundreds of FCs globally with hundreds of thousands of workers takes time. Each FC is run largely independently with its own leadership team, so naturally the results would vary across FCs, especially early on.

I would challenge this author and the NYT to find a large ""essential"" company that did more in a shorter time than Amazon, and who has been more transparent about it. Perhaps an article that contrasts efforts of different companies."

In less civilized times Bezos and his family of ladies and lords would be greeted by masses of humanity with pitchforks and torches waiting to separate their bodies from their heads and/or burning, hanging and shooting them.

In more civilized times antitrust and securities laws would rein in and rule them via balanced and checked legislative, executive and judicial branches in our Constitutional republic of united states.

If only we lived in a divided limited different power constitutional republic of united states where the people were the ultimate sovereign power over their elected and selected hired help?"

What kind of human being could be so callous as to initiate policies that cause suffering and even death to the very people who have worked so hard to make possible his obscenely-large fortune?

Aided by the Murdoch family and its pernicious propaganda platform Fox News, this small group of insatiable capitalists  has seized political power in what is in effect a coup that has given them control of the U.S. Senate, the White House and the Supreme Court.

The Amazon workers in this sad article -- trapped in dangerous conditions by their need to make a living -- remind me of feudal serfs whose lives were ruled by the distant lord who owned their fiefdom. They were expendable chattels, existing only to enrich the lord."
2020-05-19 10:52:56,"The description of the group photo for St. Paddy's day March 17 where you disparage the lack of social distancing rings false.  Because no one was talking about social distancing until at least a week or two later.  Certainly not in my own Federal law enforcement workplace where we were conversing and interacting at close proximity.  Until we weren't.  One of the most striking and appalling aspects of the pandemic has been its void where knowledge and leadership should have been.  Just some very dumb-seeming people without a clue awaiting their cues from above.  In many cases, the cues were to direct the ongoing greed game at any human cost.  Clearly this is what Amazon did."
2020-05-19 13:13:59,"In a real world. The government would have used its authority to take over Amazon for an indeterminate period of time, ie, as long as needed. Made it a safe place to work. Raised wages dramatically. Put workers rights and health front and center. Told Bezos he could have it back after the emergency and to go chill out with his 25 billion dollars. As well at the same time, to shore up the Postal Service in the same ways. This would have secured supply chains for both business and consumer, circumvent any price gouging, put the safety of American workers and consumers first and done away with the insecurity of depending on one rich jerk for the entirety of a nation. But we don't live in a real world do we, we live in a Fox News addled Trumpian dystopia."

I have not dog in this hunt and I compete with Amazon, but you have to present a balanced story.  You can still tell the story you've presented but it will actually be more credible and interesting if you address the societal tradeoffs we've made in this crisis."
2020-05-19 14:52:21,"I will continue to order from Amazon no matter how much shaming is lobbed towards them.  They are continuing to employ and pay over 500,000 people during this crisis which is exactly why they have a target on their back.  For some reason, employing people and paying them money and paying payroll taxes is some sort of sin in today’s corona virus culture."
2020-05-19 14:52:43,"My sons just took jobs as personal shoppers, one with Whole Foods/Amazon, the other with Walmart. Both describe the total lack of compliance with masks and social distancing among the employees in the warehouses/stores, despite having been educated when hired. These large companies should be hiring people to monitor compliance but at the same time, each employee should take personal responsibility. But if we can’t get the educated leaders of our country to understand the benefits of such measures, how do we expect the least educated workers to understand concepts of public health?"
2020-05-19 14:56:15,"If Amazon had closed its warehouses it would have caused tremendous damage to the nation. Millions of Americans have relied on deliveries from Amazon during the quarantine. I'm sure the company would have been criticized loudly if it had stopped delivering. It would have closed off a lifeline that millions were depending on. Just as Trump ordered meat plants to stay open, in spite of sick employees, it's easy to imagine him doing the same if Amazon had closed."
2020-05-19 14:56:58,"I'm only amazed warehouse outbreaks haven't been reported sooner. They probably exist. We just don't know about them. You should take a drive out by West Valley City on Utah-201. There are an awful lot of warehouses. I'll bet no one is checking safety conditions in any of them.

All of which comes back to the basic principles surrounding collective labor. Unionized French workers can demand Amazon change practices. Non-union US workers can barely get Amazon to admit there's a problem, much less claim any responsibility.

Workers better wise up. Business by any political stripe does not have your best interests at heart. You are an expendable commodity. Unlike hand sanitizer though, employees have the ability to organize and strike. I suggest warehouse workers get on it. That goes for labor in general too."
2020-05-19 15:06:42,Amazon needs to downsize its workforce and not have them standing shoulder to shoulder.  Mr Bezos was warned from other buildings that their working conditions were not safe.  This is what a right to work state is all about .  At least with a union they would have gone on strike to demand safer working conditions.  Blame these illnesses and deaths on Trump and his GOP who thought up the right to work over unions.
2020-05-19 15:09:52,So many of your commenters fall prey to a false choice. We could have both safety and timely delivery by Amazon. People who think we must make a choice between the two are wrong.

Now he wants to stop paying in June the $2 an hour hazard pay to Amazon and Whole Foods employees.

I'm sorry but at what point does the inequality stop making sense in the United States. We gave the 1% and corporations tax breaks to point where they are now pay a lower percentage of taxes than the middle class work under the auspicious that they are the job creators, yet where workers are told to have 3 to 6 months salary in their savings, companies and billionaires cry hardship after 1 or 2 months.

We gave Bezos and the rest of the billionaires club $800 billion in taxes, time for them to give some of it back to the workers."
2020-05-19 15:25:02,Amazonis is obsessed with productivity. One of his Vice Presidents quit over this obsession. All warehouse workers and people in the tight quarter line or work productions should be protected by a union for fair productivity which means better work conditions for this type of work throughout the United States. The owners really have a sweat shop mentality and that could be harnessed in by unions that demand better working condition .That is the goal. And the companies are fearful of that and hey are wrong.
2020-05-19 15:31:07,"I am relieved to see that the French government and its courts have been holding Amazon accountable in that country. It gives me hope that somewhere, there will be a place to live where Amazon doesn't completely take over the retail business."
2020-05-19 15:31:26,"So, Amazon isn't going to be limited by a pandemic; indeed, America depends on Amazon now to deliver supplies.

Mr. Bezos claims to have spent $4 billion on ""testing."" Yet, this news story makes no discussion of how Amazon is conducting said testing, what test is it using, who is administering said test, nor is mention made of tracking and tracing Covid19 into the workers' homes.

Amazon should be an interesting testing opportunity for epidemiologists, and an opportunity for OSHA authorities, to maintain safety in the workplace during a pandemic with a serious testing program.

I wonder if the $4 billion number is real."

2020-05-19 15:42:42,I buy stuff from Amazon. I guess I'm enabling this. By definition capitalism is going to put money ahead of people. It's a system that's always kept at least 1/2 of the workforce down at slave wages and bad working conditions. We need a better system.

Could Amazon have done more sooner? Yea highly likely. Are there other companies out there with inadequate and slow responses to the virus? Absolutely. It is low hanging fruit to simply investigate the largest company and hate the super rich people.

2020-05-19 16:17:49,"I wish these pieces were more balanced. I appreciate the risk Amazon employees face every day, and companies like Amazon should do all they can to ensure a safe environment, but context matters. This article feels either deliberately one-sided or just lazy. Here is some context I'd like to know from the author:

1) 900 reported cases of 400K employees. That's 1 in every 444 employees. US numbers overall are (reported on worldometer) 1 in every 212 citizens. Even if the US total cases are not understated, and Amazon cases are understated by 2X, Amazon case rate is no worse than the US general population. Hardly an outlier demanding special attention. 

2) How does this compare to businesses like grocery stores? The proximity store employees work with coworkers and customers is much closer than an Amazon warehouse. Where is the NYTimes scrutiny of those businesses? 

3) Similarly, what would the impact to public health be of Amazon reducing capacity? I suspect it would be more people in stores and more illnesses overall. Why not ask that question?

Amazon employees face a very real risk in continuing to go to work in an enclosed space. I simply wish articles like this would cease painting Amazon as an evil empire, when in fact, services like them (and the employees working in their warehouses) are helping keep overall US case rates down, helping keep more people employed, and helping deliver essential goods (and plenty non-essential goods) to customers."
2020-05-19 16:22:43,I am sure Amazon could have done more as a company to adequately respond to the virus. But I also don’t think Bezos sits around and strategically plans to cheap out on how the company works to save a little more money so he can be a little richer. Just a little to easy to paint this all as simple evil greedy capitalism...
2020-05-19 15:18:32,"I quit Amazon Prime. I've have only made a few desperate pandemic purchases from them since, which I'm not proud of.  

We support Amazon's sweatshops by our on-demand consumerism. Americans are digitally addled, overwhelmed by jobs and families. The transfer of wealth upward and to a minority sits on the backs of everyday Americans. But we also want what we want when we want it. Amazon is the monster riding on the collective backs of its warehouse workers, fueled by our beleaguered/false sense of privilege. 

Bezos and his crony capitalists have us right where they want us."

Every single one has been an opinion piece, and the narrative is always the same: greedy company should have just closed operations and laid off all its workers, but it kept operating and now some employees got infected. 

It's a completely reasonable opinion that Amazon should have shut down, but it's an opinion. Let's just not call it news, ok?"

I was willing to accept the Bezos scam insofar as product delivery was concerned, but I cannot accept the way he is mistreating his workers. I feel complicit  in this mistreatment when I order from Amazon. So, if we ever get out of this mess, I plan to absent myself from Amazon."

I will not patronize a company that treats it’s employees as badly as Amazon has treated their employees during this pandemic. They should have closed their plants and given the companies a deep cleaning. With the billions that Jeff Bezos has,  he certainly could have afforded it. He certainly would not have missed this profit and it is just a drop in the bucket to someone with his billions.￼ This certainly would have been good PR and probably would even get more shoppers to purchase their goods.￼

Also since the cause of the virus at Amazon was due to their negligence, they should pay their employees for sick time due to their lax behavior. That is the least they can do.

This was due in part to what has not known about COVID-19. In retrospect, it's easy to identify today the gaps in preventive measures taken by Amazon (and others). It was extremely challenging to do so in March and April as the crisis unfolded. Those of us making decisions to protect safety were in fact constantly monitoring new guidance that emerged daily & hourly - much of which was ambiguous and unclear at the time. Preventative & safety measures prescribed today were largely absent in March and April."

""If the French handle this correctly, they can turn over a new leaf in combating corporate greed. The formula is simple. 

Enact laws which criminalize – and attach extreme financial liability to – inadequate use of cash income for worker protection.

In other words, expect safety measures in highly profitable companies to be commensurate with their financial resources; criminalize spectacular pay that could have gone to improve safety. Otherwise, one is literally putting a price on human lives. 

Foregoing safety measures over costs, when execs receive millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or billions in income, should be criminalized."""

The coronavirus pandemic has helped me to remember that patience is indeed a virtue; that I don't always need what I say I need, that I don't need EVERYTHING delivered, nor do I need everything I say I need delivered the same day or in two days. The pandemic has reminded me of the extent to which the people who desperately need these jobs have been exploited and taken for granted.

I don't want these workers to lose their jobs, but I do want to slow down the greed that, prior to the pandemic, was spinning out of control - on both sides of capitalism coin.

In January and February it was China's problem, in February and into March it was the flu, by mid-March it was an unknown danger to most, and in April it was a known danger by everyone. By unknown danger, I mean the need for masks for all and strict social distancing, never enforced before. By April all this was known. Workplace behavior followed these patterns, as our general knowledge grew. And the ability to enforce this grew as our knowledge grew.  (The downgrading of all accurate information by our President only prolonged this process. If there is blame, it is Trump, not Bezos.) In short, officials had to move managers to move supervisors to make changes that workers in turn had to follow. It was a chain that could break to the extent one of the parties disregarded the urgency of enforcement. The urgency of enforcement depended upon the ability of anyone of the parties to internalize the need.
So here we are and other than Trump, there is enough unmet responsibility to go around. Now there are no excuses   for companies and their managers at all levels to ignore what we've learned."

That Jeff Bezos had already been able to get away with exploiting workers to such extremes prior to Covid is morally abhorrent. What he’s able to get away with now that Amazon has become such a pivotal service to the continued sustenance of human life is untenable.

Contingency plans were made. Strict procedures and protocols were implemented. We very quickly responded and mobilized everyone, the machinists, office staff, contractors, etc. in such a way that, since this started, we have had no contagion in any of our facilities (5 worldwide.....fingers crossed). We are considered essential and so we are a good example of a company staying in operation and managing the situation for a relatively long period of time.

One more thing: the owners of our company really care about us. They care about the community. They care. We have had to take some salary cuts and forced time off, but it has been well-managed. No one has been laid off. I'm truly fortunate to work for such a company.

So, you have to ask yourselves a question: is it possible, even slightly so, that a company as large and presumably sophisticated as Amazon could protect the interests if its employees with a smidgen of respect and regard?  Furthermore, isn't it about time, especially in the U.S. that workers quit agreeing to ""right-to-work"" laws and working for subsistence wages with few or no benefits.

I know, lots of words, but we should all be outraged at what has been exposed by the contagion. People need to demand positive changes in the workplace."

That's less than half the infection rate for the country as a whole (900 out of 400,000 is .23%, compared to .47% for the United States as a whole).

In March, the workers were promised 2-week paid leave if they were to become sick of coronavirus, however it was impossible at time to get tested for covid19 even if one had it because Ohio didn't have enough test. In April, workers were given unlimited unpaid time leave so if they were sick, they can at least stay home, just without pay. Starting May, the unlimited unpaid time was taken away so now sick people or people who are still waiting for their test still have to show up for work.

The aisles are less than three feet wide.) We are expected to share coats, boots, gloves and snowsuits for fridge/freezer work. And don’t get me started on the lack of disinfecting  that goes on.

2020-05-19 20:02:55,"Of Amazon's 400,000 warehouse workers, how many had influenza in each of the flu seasons over the last few years?  

Here in New York state, the governor just announced that most of the 300 new Covid cases per day are among people that have been locked down in their homes -- not people that are what are called here ""essential workers"" that go to work each day. 

Like all the influenzas that have raced through society in the past, there is no stopping this new influenza -- with its new name Covid-2 -- from spreading.  

Proper medical advice from employers to employees during influenza season is ""If you get the flu, stay home until you're better.""

The same is true today."

What were the guidelines issued to Amazon for cleaning and sanitizing? What were the guidelines issued to Amazon for requiring masks? What plan was required to be filed by Amazon for the warehouse to remain open - the terms of how procedures would change to ensure distancing? How was management impacted if they did not follow the rules? Were they fined? Were managers required to have managing distancing in their measured performance? And most importantly, who issued the requirements? 

Did the state require a plan or issue worker protection guidelines? I know it wasn't the Feds or OSHA. 

We put companies who stayed open in the position of having to search out best practices.  Up until NY closed, the medical office where I worked received no guidance at all on cleaning, sanitizing, distancing. Not from the state, the board of health or the CDC. We looked for guidance from the association governing our specialty. We looked at other practices, and made a few of our own decisions - such as requiring employees to wear masks back in March.

I fault businesses for abusing and exploiting workers. But more than that I fault every governmental body which failed those workers - caught with their pants down, or in the case of the Trump Administration both uncaring and incompetent.

Could Amazon have done better? Yeah, definitely. Bezos has the cash. But surely he should have been compelled to  do better, with specific requirements."

If anyone should be held to a HIGHER standard, it's Amazon and other high tech industry.  Instead, they dragged their feet, disregarded safety suggestions, and claimed hardship.  

So if Amazon, one of the richest companies with lowest tax rate (if any), can get away with this, what about the millions of struggling small businesses that really cannot afford proper measures?  In other words, forget it.  So we endanger workers AND let their businesses fail.  Talk about Social Darwinism.

And guess who will emerge even richer after this is over?

And remember folks, the Amazons of the country were exempted from the health insurance requirement.  Only companies with less than 500 employees are required to maintain health insurance for laid off workers.

Perhaps the air quality in cities says even more.  Amazon, please make country of origin information visible for all your online purchases including in your product searches.

US and World history - is rife with examples that Business Leaders and their interests, are not the interests of those they exploit. Its a fallacy, a lie that people like Bezos, etc, in any way, in any percentage - are in business to give opportunity to their workers. Or to bring economic advantages to a community. 

If such ideas were real...there would not have been any need for walk-outs, strikes, or Unions. No reasons for organizing workers in any way, no reasons for lawsuits, or any government intervention.

Apparently he was throwing his executives under the bus he knew that employees didnt have clean warehouses or ppe.  He knew and he didnt do anything.  Not till France hit his  greedy bottom line by shuting down the warehouses, did he take anything seriously.

The unions in France need to get  America on the union ttrains to stop the  senseless slaughter of employees for greed.
Boycott amazon as we should boycott Facebook since the lives of Americans dont matter.  Facebook allows bigotry, child molesters,  and other deviants to live on their platforms. Zoom allows hackers of racist persuasion to interrrupt sessions.  We have untested software constantly being promoted as if everything is ok and it isnt.

We all want to go back to work, we all want to get packages in a timley fashion.  However most of us dont want anyone to loose their lives or contaminate their families just so we can have a product which was made in China arrive at our door the next day.

Then you can find yourself on the street looking for a minimum wage job serving burgers and fries at a fast food chain.   

Other solution, if you hate the job so much and feel so used and abused -- find another job.   The NYT should ask this question: how many people jumped at the chance to work at Amazon's warehouse when they announced they would open a facility there?    Hazle Twp. like all of the anthracite coal region has been in a state of decline since the 1940's when the mines began to go out of business.   Places like this area beg for business, any business to move in and when those places announce they will -- people flood them with job applications.   Now these same people are blaming the company for the lax local management during a pandemic.   Also ask these people how many of them voted for Trump and haven't noticed that he has done a hideously poor job in regard to the pandemic and at this moment is pushing them and others in low wage jobs to get back to work without a care about their health and safety."

2020-05-20 00:46:39,"As an opinion piece, the article works moderately well. As a news report it is significantly deficient in relevant facts. For instance, it omits mention of the number of employees at the fulfillment center and barely mentions that the warehouse is in a very hard hit area. The warehouse is located in Luzerne County, where 10% of  population caught COVID-19. Worse, it is written to finger Amazon facility implicitly as the source of SARS-CoV-2 whenever one of its employees became ill from it, despite the almost certain fact that quite a few of those employees lived in Luzerne or similarly impacted nearby counties and had considerable non-work exposure.

That isn't to say Amazon might not have done better; hindsight always reveals imperfections. However, if the Hazle township fulfillment center had the average number of employees, their employees had a much lower infection rate than the population of the surrounding area."

What I'm noticing now with this story as well as my company's is that you replace ""COVID"" with ""Flu"" and switch the timeline to December - February it becomes eerily similar yet far less dramatic.  Granted we knew little about what  COVID would bring so locking down for 2 months was clearly the best option.  What's giving me hope now is that we can be more precise and strategic with our approach to future clusters that pop up.  It feels like we just took a 3 trillion $ crash course in what a lot of countries already learned from SARS."
2020-05-20 02:02:25,Amazon could be an example of labor rights and still make billions. Respecting workers should not be a hindrance but be celebrated by shareholders and Bezos.

They use our educated human capital but how much do they put back into our public schools?  How much longer will residents be robbed by corporate America?  Corporate socialism has broken our state and many others. I hope these employees recover from Covid and Amazon provides them with excellent healthcare coverage.
2020-05-20 09:29:31,"Because Jeff Bezos doesn't have the money to design warehouses that protect workers? It is possible to design a working environment where each worker has his or her own segment of a warehouse to pick from, and where high quality protective gear is mandatory and free to workers.

Wasn't part of the opening story, no evidence provided subsequently. Has there been bias? I'm willing to believe it, but I want to hear evidence. Did Dickey get the disease because he was exposed to a lot of people through work exposure (another factor she cites) or because he was at Mardi Gras? Did air pollution really make him more vulnerable? It seems so obvious based on the opening story that the major factor in Dickey's death was his underlying diabetes and high blood pressure, which she touches on but immediately pivots away from to suggest that mentioning what I guess you could call ""lifestyle diseases"" becomes a kind of victim blaming. Nothing of the sort. His death was a tragedy, full stop. What's happened to black Americans with Covid19 is horrendous. But her explanation here is wholly inadequate."
2020-05-20 13:53:25,"As I was listening to this podcast, I became profoundly angry. COVID 19 is just the LATEST sickness that has killed Black Americans in disproportional numbers. The truth is that this COVID 19 death rate is getting MORE attention than the previous scourges that plagues the Black community.  

COVID 19 just proves that little has changed in terms of real race relations (addressing the Institutional Racism that is pervasive in our judicial, educational, and especially our healthcare system). In the book, Medical Apartheid by Harriet Washington, it documents how the United States medical system is ingrained with a legacy of Institutional Racism...that to this day, the vast majority of Black Americans do not trust the healthcare system...because of the so many stories passed down from father/mother to son/daughter about the negative, and at times, deadly consequences that happen when you 'go see the doctor'.

The book, Medical Apartheid came out in 2006, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the history WHY Black Americans die from not only COVID 19 in astronomical numbers, but of ANY virus/pandemic/sicknesses that have plagued America. The problem is 2 fold: no.1: Simple racism, and no.2: sheer lack of empathy for America's non-white population.

I do not think anything will change any time soon because there is no social or political will to help 'the least of these' in our society....let alone the 'non-white of these'."
2020-05-20 14:23:56,How about Latinx/Hispanics? In states like Massachusetts the infection and death rates for Latinx is much higher than African Americans. Why is it that nobody is focusing on the effect of covid-19 in Latinx communities?
2020-05-20 17:15:31,"Yet another podcast where NYT paints a picture of institutional racism with broad strokes and no substance. 

First let's talk about the delivery of the piece. The first 14.5 mins was an anecdote by a woman whose husband died. While that is a tragedy, you have to ask yourself why is it in the beginning of this podcast. Because NYT is here telling you that YOU should feel bad. That's one way to set the tone.

We finally get to the ""answer"" after 15 minutes of anecdote. They give a few reasons, a) more service workers and b) unconscious racial bias kills Black people c) Blacks have more health problems because institutional racism provides them a terrible living environment. 

I'll use the NYC data from the .gov GitHub, as there isn't a complete national data set. The death rate is 2x more according to the adjusted data set to population. So more Blacks get COVID. But, in terms of Deaths per Hospitalized, they are the roughly equal. Here they are in Asian, Black, Latino, and White: 37.46%, 32.30%, 35.51%, 39.12%. And here is Deaths per Case in the same order:16.25%, 14.69%, 15.26%, 13.75%. 

There is a very real problem of Blacks and Latinos getting infected at a higher rate. But the claim that they're DYING more because healthcare workers are ""unconsciously racist"" or because ""they are sicker"" is false. This is very shameful reporting. While racial inequalities exist, false representation is unacceptable. Meanwhile Hasidic Jews are the affected the most. Why? Nobody cares."
2020-05-20 18:38:04,"What a bunch of nonsense this was.... 

I love the Daily but this was a ridiculous stretch to blame society, and our horrible history of racism, on the death rate.  

Look at Blaine County, ID and their high infection rate.   There was a super spreader event there early on— a black skier reunion.    Check the infection and death rate from those attendees and see how it compares with the country as a whole.    And while you are at it see how the underlying conditions of those black skiers compares to the underlying conditions of all black deaths.     That would be actual reporting and science.... not hyperbole"
2020-05-20 19:32:46,"My heart goes out to Mrs. Charles and family. Having grown up in carnival culture, I know it is next to impossible to cancel club activities after many months of preparation even amidst a pandemic. 

I believe the reporter made fundamental, valid points. It is simplistic to reduce the vulnerability of African Americans to underlying health issues without asking where these issues come from. We should treat everyone with the dignity and respect all human beings deserve."
2020-05-20 14:17:27,"I strongly suspect most educated people with any role as a public health authority who say any disease is an equal opportunity killer know that this is either almost never true or exactly never true.

It would be better to say ""this disease is an intolerable risk for almost everyone, we do not yet know the lasting damage it causes to survivors, and those risks are several times worse for some demographics.""

Is it important for the average person to make this distinction? For amplifying empathy, understanding policy decisions and guarding against bias, discrimination and disinformation, yes. For following public health directives and taking precautions? Not so much. In the short term, the latter is probably what most authority figures choose to prioritize to the detriment of advancing a deeper understanding."

2020-05-21 00:19:15,I have been following some reports that give scientific analysis of the effect of being deficient in vitamin D. That deficiency causes a weakened immune system.  Dr. John Campbell of the UK has been sharing daily reports for some months about COVID-19 around the world.  He has shared information about the fact that people who are naturally dark-skinned have a more challenging time in benefiting from ultraviolet rays in sunlight. Sunlight's ultraviolet rays produces vitamin D naturally in our bodies. The paler our skin the more easily our bodies acquire the natural vitamin D. When we are outdoors during the sunnier months and have more skin area exposed to the sunlight we garner more vitamin D.  Sunburn is not the goal; vitamin D acquisition is.  During the winter even the paler skinned among us should be supplementing vitamin D.

2020-05-21 12:08:07,"I was very disappointed that the podcast did not address the impact of diet on underlying conditions. Most conditions such as heart disease, can be addressed and often reversed with a whole-food plant-based diet. In fact, since most who died had underlying conditions, it stands for reason that in addition to be researching for a vaccine and medication (which cost a lot of money) we should promote a healthy plant-based diet which cost nothing. You can eat a vegan diet for very cheap if you avoid the vegan junk."
2020-05-21 19:06:04,Why were so many people in this podcast episode afraid to talk about the elephant in the room: DIET?!

Americans need to have sobering conversations about obesity and the negative health conditions that are a result of eating too much unhealthy foods.
2020-05-21 22:46:27,"Okay,..high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney disease. The man already had one foot in grave and the other foot on a banana peel.

2020-06-02 18:22:12,"I usually really appreciate listening to the Daily, but felt that this podcast really didn't do justice to a very big question of why the covid-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting black people. There is no evidence that ""weathering"" has had any causal impact. There are systemic reasons why black people have been disproportionately affected, in terms of both infection levels and severity of disease.  There are environmental factors where there may be higher employment in ""front-line"" jobs, leading to more exposure, but delayed care-seeking is also likely to be an important factor for both higher infection and mortality rates.  If infected individuals are delaying seeking care due to poor access or the cost of health services, then they are infecting more individuals in their community that they're coming in contact with and also likely to have poorer outcomes (due to starting treatment later).  Higher rates of underlying conditions, in part due to weaker public health education and adherence to healthy diet and exercise practices but also linking back to the issue of poor access to healthcare, is also a major driver.  Looking at the impact of other infectious diseases like tuberculosis and its impact on vulnerable populations in other countries would help shed light on this question."

However, none of this should make any difference.  No one should seek medication based on recommendations by non-medical people.  It is dangerous and Mr. Trump is showing a disregard for the health and safety of his followers.   This is evidenced by the couple on the West Coast that took a form of the drug used in aquarium treatments.  One died and the other almost died.  
It is your right to follow Trump.  For me, he lacks credibility and honesty, which are not the characteristics of someone I chose to follow.  I have seen little evidence of genius and a lot of evidence of ignorance.  His ""genius"" is to make himself seem the victim of others, when in fact his believers are his victims. His business genius has been absent as the economy has only continued the trend firmly set by the Obama administration.  The same is true with the stock market.

2020-05-20 19:04:00,"I once took  Mefloquine, an anti-malarial ""sister drug,"" (CDC*) of what our often-unthinking President is using as protection against the Covid virus. FYI: malaria is caused by parasites; viruses enter the cell, change the DNA, then rapidly replicate. 

According to medical, rather than wishful-thinking, websites, some side effects of Mefloquine are hallucinations and insanity, which I suffered during the third week of taking the drug. This was really unpleasant but reversible; hydroxychloroquine, on the other hand, is sometimes used off-label for rheumatic conditions, not viruses. In test cases, neurological damage from overdoses (appropriate dosing is unclear for off-label use), is irreversible. These include unpleasant brain-induced body sensations, partial or total, blindness, and death- not insanity yet, as with the chemically similar Mefloquine. 

I wondered if the President got a stock deal from Big Pharma to lead the public in this direction for financial gain (no financial disclosure yet). Maybe he is feeling helpless, ready to try anything. Regarding permanent insanity, no offense, with him, I'm not sure I would know the difference. 

From CDC:
""Hydroxychloroquine ...has the potential to produce permanent symptoms of neurotoxic vestibulopathy including tinnitus, headache, dizziness, vertigo, disequilibrium, paresthesias, ocular disturbance and neuropathy.

Ya think?
The exploratory and preclinical stages often lasts 2-4 years. Current technologies and genetic mapping are compressing this time enormously. Pre-clinical studies use tissue-culture or cell-culture systems and animal testing to assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and its immunogenicity, or ability to provoke an immune response. Again, current understanding and advances in virology sciences may justify substantially shortening this period. Researchers may adapt the candidate vaccine during the pre-clinical state to try to make it more effective. They may also do challenge studies with the animals, meaning that they vaccinate the animals and then try to infect them with the target pathogen. Many candidate vaccines never progress beyond this stage because they fail to produce the desired immune response. The pre-clinical stages often lasts 1-2 years and usually involves researchers in private industry. Then, if we get lucky, a formulation works and an application for testing is made, then phases I, II, III and IV (if additional study is warranted).  These stages, in the past, have lasted as long as 10 to 15 years. To expect an effective vaccine in less that 1 and a half years is extremely optimistic.  That optimism combined with our lack of successes searching for vaccines for MERS, SARS and all the other corona viruses borders on fantasy."

2020-05-20 17:15:00,"Well, at a minimum it appears that we will be able to vaccinate and prevent monkeys from getting coronavirus in the very near future.

Seriously, in all probability we will not have a safe and effective vaccine for humans for many years.  Safe and effective vaccines take years and even decades, especially a vaccine that would be globally injected to treat the entire world population in short order to work safely and effectively in all race and population groups.

I wish we had a vaccine yesterday, but come on already, we need to start planning on a society where a vaccine will not be available for many more years instead of relying on science to provide one sometime in 2021.

Unfortunately, all this news on early success is leading everyone to believe we will have defeated coronavirus by the end of 2021, which is highly unlikely."

If the antibodies remain for a significant time then it is likely one will be developed. It will also have to be determined if the level of antibodies triggered by a vaccine remain as long and attain  the same level as found in a recovered patient. Simply triggering low levels or very temporary levels may not be sufficient. Thus far I have not heard of anyone getting the virus twice, so that may be a good thing. In those cases where it was suspected that people did get it twice there was some doubt about the tests used to determine that.

It would also be interesting to know as well why some people appear to trigger antibodies very readily on their own and see only mild cases of the virus. Even in apparently very healthy individuals there is a great variation in the level of symptoms that one gets."
2020-05-20 17:59:18,"Quick question from someone outside science: if sailors on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt were infected, then recovered, then later tested positive again, does this mean the human CV  tests are too unreliable to assess whether a vaccine works or not? If actually having the infection does not produce immunity, how is a vaccine supposed to do it?  Would it be wiser to concentrate on developing a useful treatment for those who get sick, rather than investing the majority of our efforts in the possible chimera of a vaccine?

The good news is that initial results on vaccine development are encouraging. There is a good chance there will be an effective vaccine within a year or two, which is record time.

Development, testing and production of a vaccine will require a joint, synergistic effort of the government, academia, and private industry. Recognizing the essential requirement of an all-hands-on-deck approach, the NIH formed the Activ collaboration, jointly led by Francis Collins, head of the NIH, and Paul Stoffels, a leader of Johnson and Johnson, one of the largest drug and vaccine manufacturers.

Whatever NY Times writers and many of the paper’s reader may think of big pharmaceutical companies, today we very much need them. 

Drug companies today face an existential threat to their existence: American tort lawyers. This is why J&J stopped selling talc based baby powder in the US. Tens of thousands of multi-billion dollar lawsuits have been filed against drug companies, including J&J; most or all seem to be based on junk science.

The disease itself takes 2 weeks to progress.  1 Week to process the data.  1-2 weeks to set up the trial.  That's a conservative 8 weeks.  However, the data would be processed instantaneously and the trials should already be set up.  Therefore it is essentially 5-6 weeks to get the go-no-go for mass production.

2020-05-20 23:16:05,"So - I have just read all the 42 comments appearing so far and most seem to have missed the main points of this article and this research. 

This study is ongoing. It is being done in well-designed, controlled experiments by highly skilled scientists - the basis of good science. Results are truthfully given. No conclusions are offered because that would be conjecture at this point. This is really careful work, people. 

And the article itself is really well-written and brief but conveys lots of solid information. Kudos!"
2020-05-21 00:05:53,"Animals who are exploited as subjects in experiments cannot give free and informed consent to their being used in this way. This is why we say that animal testing is unethical. It is all the more hideously so when it is expected that some of the subjects will be made to grow sick, and even perhaps to die.

And note that it remains unclear whether the monkeys are adequate models. The only ethical way to devise new vaccines is to use human volunteers as subjects."
2020-05-20 23:50:04,Put a lid on the hype..let’s see the refereed papers.
2020-05-21 01:02:49,"Animal testing has proven time and time and time again to not only be morally bankrupt, but completely false science. Let's leave the animals alone, already!"
2020-05-21 01:03:20,"There is a small Zoo on US 61 north of Baton Rouge not too far from Parchman farm, a maximum security prison. It's  an outdoor zoo with monkeys in open barred cages and if you stop and watch the monkeys for a few moments they will ,without fail, throw feces at you.They do that for their own entertainment.Who can blame them?"
2020-05-21 01:19:06,I am paying no attention to these breathless announcements until my CVS or doctor is telling me to come on in and get my Covid-19 vaccine(s). This is foolishness.
2020-05-21 04:44:14,"Humans get sick from coronavirus by caging, selling and eating vulnerable wildlife, then abuse still more animals to protect themselves from the infected ones they shouldn't have eaten in the first place. I could barely read this callous piece."
2020-05-21 03:35:22,"AD26? Is that the covid-19 virus? No? Then shouldn't these studies commence in real-world applications? That AD26 was created by the same doctor creating the vaccine would require intensive peer review before being trotted out before the public, but the effort is far from that step. Too bad, but at this point sounds like a snake-oil salesman's pitch."
2020-05-21 11:42:21,"New York Times previously published that ""there’s no indication pets get sick or spread the virus"" ... Countless studies have shown that animals do not get the virus. So how are we testing a vaccine on animals (monkeys specifically) when they cannot get the virus?

According to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]:
""Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect humans.

Risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people Some coronaviruses that infect animals can sometimes be spread to humans and then spread between people, but this is rare.""

SO the conclusion is that this article has no substance and is just an opinion piece, instead of a factual article which would be much more beneficial in such cases."

2020-05-20 13:44:45,"It's obvious that the coronavirus originated in China whether it was from a lab or a wet market; no one has suggested that it came from anywhere else.  To rail against China and the W.H.O. for allowing this pandemic to spread is understandable and to a large degree warranted.  The president understands very well how trade and money effects world organizations and foreign nations.  Financial warfare requires the immediate attention and response from the target.  It's every bit as effective as military action and be just as crippling economically.  Naturally China and the W.H.O. don't want to be called out on the world stage for being caught, who would?  It's not about making enemies, it's about holding nations and institutions accountable.  About talking loudly, carrying a big stick and knowing when to use it."
2020-05-20 13:47:17,I can’t think of the name Trump without thinking of the word irony. Of course the W.H.O. should at some point help investigate and reflect upon missteps (including how to anticipate and manage our human tendency to avoid blame) in the global response to this pandemic. But imagine the W.H.O. suggesting that the U.S. response deserves formal investigation as part of that. President Trump would go ballistic.
2020-05-20 14:03:54,"WHO acted intelligently and responsibly—in a way, as a strong, effective parent might respond to one too many tantrums: ignore the screaming to gain attention and control, walk away while speaking softly and reasonably.
WHO did what needed to be done for the benefit of the organization and the world.
Trump has so weakened the USA throughout the world in nearly every area.  
I am relieved WHO did not try to placate him."
2020-05-20 14:04:59,"The WHO relies on the cooperation and funds from all countries that can afford to do so, especially in the face of a swiftly transmitted and deadly worldwide pandemic. 

This Administration's stated intention to ""go it alone"" and refusal to contribute to funding WHO's efforts around the globe is absolutely indefensible; Congress absolutely must call out the president and members of this Administration NOW for its attempt to deflect responsibility for its own failure to ensure the US stockpile of needed equipment, especially PPE and ventilators, much earlier than March when so many tried in vain to warn of the consequences that have resulted in so many tragic deaths in the U.S. and among longstanding allies everywhere..."
2020-05-20 14:07:24,"The WHO did show systemic failures during COVID crisis, from mis-reporting, to late reporting, to siding with China. We do need a global health organization, but not one that is biased and favors any particular entity."

2020-05-20 13:19:25,Trump complains about WHO and their response to the pandemic. What irony. What has Trump done at all in the U.S. to respond in  a proactive way? He's always trying to divert from his many failures.
2020-05-20 14:32:42,"“Besides his accusations, Mr. Trump’s letter also contained a number of falsehoods and misleading statements. One of them was that the W.H.O. ‘consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal.’”

Except this is consistent with a BBC news article entitled “What did China do about the Coronavirus: a timeline” which observed: “1 December - The first onset of symptoms are observed, according to the Lancet.” In addition, the timeline is also consistent with NYT reporting from early February, As New Coronavirus Spread, China’s Old Habits Delayed Fight.” “A reconstruction of the crucial seven weeks between the appearance of the first symptoms in early December and the government’s decision to lock down the city, based on two dozen interviews with Wuhan residents, doctors and officials, on government statements and on Chinese media reports, points to decisions that delayed a concerted public health offensive.”"
2020-05-20 14:33:39,Trump is so transparent. It is obvious to all except his cult following that he is trying to shift the blame onto anything or anyone other than himself. The fact that on this case it's to other countries is incredible and frightening. Obama had to deal with Bush's mess and now Biden is going to spend enormous time money and resources to clean up Trump's mess.
2020-05-20 14:36:03,"45, our bully with his mallet tries to bludgeon another organization critical to our health and welfare.  This hurts everyone but trump believes this will distract from his deadly failure to deal early and effectively with the pandemic.  With Murdoch's fox, and OAN, brietbart, etc., spewing out their propaganda  it probably will work with a dangerous % of voters.  We are learning just how fragile our democracy really is. America is like the Germany in 1929 and into the 30s, we see our beautiful checks and balances collapsing before our eyes.  We have 1 more chance in the coming election to save ourselves."
2020-05-20 14:59:22,"The ""China lied"" narrative is completely rejected by the entire world scientific and epidemiological community. Go ahead; show me ONE bona fide expert in the field who supports it. 

But here is our problem. Our ""opposition"" party, the Democrats, are reluctant to vigorously expose Trump's lies because we are in the opening rounds of a new BIPARTISAN cold war against China, and this narrative is a useful lie. Do you have Shumer, Pelosi, et al going on cable news to tell the people that the WHO has it right? No, of course not, even though doing so would do serious political damage to Trump's reelection campaign. For the Democratic establishment, this would damage the anti-China campaign, which is MUCH more important than beating Trump."
2020-05-20 15:06:02,"Finding no traction on ""Obamagate,"" Trump pivots to a new smokescreen: ""Chiner"" and the WHO. All well and good for the members of his cult, but the rest of us are left scratching our heads at this strategy. If the goal is to deflect blame from his colossal failure in the face of this pandemic, why does the man select an approach that will just cause more death, making his failure all the more salient? It's almost like he hasn't thought it through!"
2020-05-20 15:07:39,"The WHO should have a routine performance review just as other organizations are. It is willful ignorance to believe that the WHO is a purely scientific organization.

The Who might have made a mis-step, but overall for years have done spectacular jobs in may countries across the globe . The President had but one job, in one country and had failed - is failing miserably on so many fronts- it's borderline criminal.

Our country has over 1.5 million cases of the coronavirus and almost (last I checked) 100,000 dead.  More than any other country in the world."
2020-05-20 16:02:54,"I do not know where to begin with this.  As an American, I am both frustrated with our government and as a citizen embarrassed by its actions.

Trump's ""America First"" has been isolating the U.S. since he took office.  He began trade wars with much of the world without even attempting negotiations first.  He withdrew from the Trans Pacfic Trade agreement without explanation.  The U.S. is now withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and he has threatened to withdraw from NATO.

I do not care if the United States is first but I do care that we cooperate with other nations.  We need to participate in global actions and not subvert their intentions.

Now it is WHO that Trump is trying to bully.  The world is facing a pandemic and he is picking a fight.  The presidency is not some schoolyard where the strong pick on the weak.

In November, I will be voting Blue and probably for the first time in my 76 years, I'm voting a straight Blue ticket.  This has to stop and I understand that a Republican controlled Congress will not put brakes on Trump if he is re-elected."
2020-05-20 14:27:08,"The WHO wrote on Dec. 18, 2003:

“The possibility that a SARS outbreak could occur following a laboratory accident is a risk of considerable importance, given the relatively large number of laboratories currently conducting research using the SARS-CoV or retaining specimens from SARS patients. These laboratories currently represent the greatest threat for renewed SARS-CoV transmission through accidental exposure associated with breaches in laboratory biosafety.”

SARS escaped this Beijing government virus lab four times in 2004.  We can reasonably suspect that SARS-CoV-2 also tiptoed unnoticed or noticed from the Wuhan Lab in 2019.  That lab was studying highly-contagious SARS-like coronaviruses.

Today the WHO suspiciously and curiously promotes the idea that SARS-CoV-2 of Wuhan is a natural spillover virus, because it says ‘people do not usually come into close contact with bats’ (unless you are a Wuhan Virology lab technician handling bats).

So what changed from Dec. 18, 2003 and 2020?  China’s corrupt influence of the WHO, which is now ignoring what it wrote to its members on Dec. 18, 2003."
2020-05-20 16:08:56,"So Trump is blaming WHO for covering up for China, but now he wants WHO to serve for his interest and cover up his downplay with the Virus."
2020-05-20 16:50:16,"Why is it that the first sentence in almost any article in the NYTimes is an attack on Trump vs. a real article with data on the topic.  Frankly, WHO didn't do a good job as far as getting the facts from China early.  That alone is not necessarily their fault as China lies and doesn't have the desire for transparency, it is trying to become a dominate global power that hoards resources and exports junk.

But, the head of WHO is suspect at least, when you look at what they announced and when.  Understand they need to be diplomatic as they work with all countries, many that are less than honest.

From what I read, over 100 countries what an investigation into China.  Most also want an investigation into the relationship that WHO/China had that impacted the pandemic.

Bottom line:  This virus was exposed to humans in November.  China did nothing to stop international travel, but did stop domestic travel.  Beijing never saw the virus.  This means they knew, but sent hundreds of thousands of Wuhan citizens in and out of the west.  They allowed the same from the west into Wuhan, and then back home.  WHO is funded to the max, and has been suspect as far as waste (most of the money goes to travel and 'salaries') for years.  WHO must be investigated.  We can do little with China without global war (?), but WHO is funded by many countries and must be held responsible."
2020-05-20 16:52:52,"Desperate measures by a desperate politician. He is trying to distract attention from his own failure of leading in this crisis. First it is the states’ responsibility To manage the crisis and now it is the WHO’s fault. But, it certainly is not the “I take no responsibility for that” President’s fault. 

He’ll be leaving a real mess for his successor’s administration in 2021."
2020-05-20 16:54:52,"China's culpability in this lies in having a political climate in which local officials were afraid to report bad news to higher-ups; they had systems in place to deal with an epidemic but did not bring them into play soon enough. 

A lesson for us all.

Before the US tries to make China legally culpable, however, it should reflect on its responsibility in allowing its guns to flow into Mexico and its bombs to fall on Yemenis. We export death by policy, not by accident."
2020-05-20 17:09:11,"WHO is a cold war era international agency that has become a political body. Time for a change. 182 World nations are infected due to their politics.

The one thing they do understand is funding. Leveraging American dollars usually gets attention. No other President got nations to pay up to NATO, except Trump.

Why the Liberals defend China and WHO is a pure mystery."
2020-05-20 20:57:53,"Trump and his administration did the same as the Chinese did. Members of his administration were afraid to bring the matter to mercurial and distracted Trump's attention like the Chinese party operatives didn't want to bring bad news to Xi. Then Trump's administration didn't want to do testing or take other actions that might unsettle the economy similar to China protecting its industrial activity and tourist industry. Trump and his  associates denied the spread of the virus claiming containment was ""airtight"" and tried to convince people that it would all go away like they were being coached in duplicity and denial by the Chinese. Trump also did nothing to prepare for disaster if the contagion broke out. The Chinese did prepare. Years ago they had captured all of the manufacturing of PPE and, understandably, they were reluctant to export items needed by their frantic citizens. Our muddying the waters with lies, half-truths and suppression of data was just as worthy of condemnation as the Chinese actions and just as deceptive to the WHO!"
2020-05-20 18:48:10,"In as much as a large portion of the US populace has either drunk the Kool-Aid of US exceptionalism and the myth of ""raising oneself up by one's pwn bootstraps"" or is so enamored of their white privilege notwithstanding that their well-being rests on the exploitation of ""other""peoples and the destruction of the environment, it is evident that change cannot happen within the US system. The only hope for change comes from the Indigenous of the world and the union of the other developed countries, Russia, China, Germany, etc. Given that, the re-election of Donald Trump may be just what is necessary to achieve that unified opposition to the US hegemony."
2020-05-20 19:06:06,"Good for W.H.O. our Allies and the other members of the WorldHealth Organization for not allowing Trump to bully them.  Sounds as if China will foot a good deal of the bill.

The more Trump is losing the PR fight about who is responsible here in the States, HIM,  the more he is threatened that he will not be elected.  If it takes this Pandemic to get rid of him, it will be at least something positive, as Trump and Trump alone is responsible for all of the deaths in this Country.  Not China nor the 
WHO.

Trump knew about it long before he even revealed it.  There are enough documents at this point, to prove it.  Navarro's memo is one that comes to mind.

Trump alone has done more damage to our International reputation than. any other President."
2020-05-20 19:18:38,"So then China could take over control of WHO, which seems to have been his biggest complaint."
2020-05-20 19:16:41,"Of course China and Russia don't want an unbiased investigation into China's deliberate suppression of the facts until it was too late.
And China has already successfully bullied the EU into changing the wording of their report.
President Trump has undoubtedly done many things wrong in his response to this virus. As have the leaders of France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and the UK.
But he's right here."

2020-05-20 21:00:31,"To the WHO: Please don’t give this lying manipulator an inch. YOU did nothing wrong. You warned the Trump administration several times about Covid 19, and they chose not to listen.  You are trying to be reasonable and it will be used to further criticize you. Please publish every single letter, email, text that warned the Trump administration about this. They cannot be allowed to blame others for their inadequacies. Don’t let them blame you."

2020-05-21 00:14:08,"The WHO is well aware of the following facts and risks but it is mute. Why?

“The danger to world public health from the escape from microbiology laboratories of pathogens capable of causing pandemics has been the subject of considerable discussion”.  *

Any known and reported lab releases are just the “tip of the iceberg” because they represent lab accidents that have not actually caused illness outside of the laboratories. The list of lab workers that have been infected accidentally in labs is very long.  They are unreported because there were no community outbreaks, and no lab director wants to lose funding because of lapses in biosecurity and biosafety.  Microscopic viral escapes can be stealthy and unnoticed by lab personnel.

“SARS has not naturally recurred, but there have been six separate “escapes” from virology labs including four distinct events at the same laboratory in Beijing.”

Lab workers and bat cave specimen collectors should have redundant PPE and be quarantined for two weeks after handling these viruses and before going out into public spaces.  It is an intolerable inconvenience to many lab workers.  It invites non-compliance.

If it happened 4 times in a government lab in Beijing, it could have happened once in the Wuhan lab in November.

2020-05-21 00:20:08,"Yes, I agree with the fact that Trump is to blame for the virus spreading in the US. HOWEVER the WHO is utterly corrupt. They have PRAISED the Chinese government for slowing the spread, even though the Chinese covered up the spread for weeks. They claimed that wearing masks was not necessary nor social distancing, and ignored the rising cases in China for months on end. Why? Because China is it's 2nd biggest contributor. Meanwhile, Taiwan, who surprisingly enough isn't part of the WHO, alerted the WHO that the virus was spreading person to person. The WHO ignored them. The Taiwan government took swift action, requiring face masks and social distancing. They have had one of the most successful responses in the world. When asked about Taiwan, the WHO's epidemiologist Bruce Alyward refused to even acknowledge their existence. This article does not give out this information, instead painting the WHO as a good group who just wants to help the world and to unite all peoples. The WHO should be condemned for their clear ties to a corrupt Chinese government, and there should be a world wide investigation into their downplaying of the disease."

 ""All of their ideas will cost money the government doesn’t have.""
------------------
From the description, it sounds like this audio is starting from a remedial economics viewpoint.  Of course we have learned from recessions past that in times of low or no interest rates, the government needs to stimulate the economy and put money into the pockets of people who need it. 

I can't listen, but it sounds like you are going to spend an hour discussing whether or not stimulus spending is even needed?  I think most Republicans and Democrats alike already agree it is; it's not ""money we don't have"" if you understand macroeconomics, not microeconomics.

Honestly, not sure if this is being ""dumbed down"" so you can defeat the ""no government spending in crisis times"" strawman that few are arguing for now -- even fiscal conservatives, but how much better might it be if we read a teaser that you were going to be discussing HOW to put government money into the hands of the affected (non-)workers and WHO should qualify to receive such funds (only citizen workers, all workers, those still working and risking as ""essentials"" who have not been laid off?)

To me, as a non-liberal but economic realist, that is the discussion the country needs to be having, and your business-oriented reporters here need to be discussion. Not at all whether such spending is wise in tight times. Of course it is! We're well past that, we just want efficient redistribution."

Originally from Sri Lanka, I grew up with milk in my tea but have come to appreciate Chinese tea.  It’s a totally different beast but many would argue that it is the purer form.  Still, strong Ceylon tea has to have milk.  And if you go into the tea plantations in the middle of Sri Lanka, they insist on adding sweetened condensed milk plus a teaspoon of sugar.  If this brew doesn’t quickly bring you to your senses, not much else will. Not even gin."

What I am not hearing however...besides the politicians saying "" You Texas, Minnesotans, New Yorkers etc. need to follow the ""guidelines."" Here is the crux of the problem. Many people could care less about the guidelines. This is where we might fail. When I hear the Texas governor say we are doing so well compared to the rest of the country. I ask. Well, yes we have been in lockdown for two months. Now what? you will expect because we are so ""extraordinary and special""  will follow ""guidelines"" after we have been locked up for weeks? There is no requirement and when someone breaks the law, like the hair stylist in Dallas, She gets $500,000 from a ""conservative driven"" go fund me campaign for breaking the law. (That besides the $18,000 she got before that from the federal government.) I am concerned. I hope whatever they are doing to open up the economy works and does not kill more people.

2020-05-19 04:18:11,"Really disappointing show. Foreign governments aren't buying this new debt; the Fed is. The Federal Reserve is buying 85% of the current debt being issued to artificially keep interest rates down. There are many risks with monetization of debt - hyperinflation and loss of reserve currency status. Both effects are likely to be felt well before the years the host mentions, but it's difficult to not buy votes in an election year. 

The Fed has been highly effective at propping up asset prices for the last twenty years, and they continue to strive to keep them aloft, which is fabulous for those who own assets. But it's increasing inequality for everyone else."

Now, the President is pushing payroll tax cuts.  The Social Security tax.  This will hasten the bankruptcy of the Social Security fund.

Deficit spending, or stimulus spending, was at the center of Keynesian Economics during an equally dire time in our country.  The Depression.  

Hoover refused to spend, Roosevelt opened the coffers to aid the recovery.  A tale of two policies.

While it may fairly be said that the War actually ended The Depression, it's unfair to say that The New Deal was without effect.

2020-05-21 13:34:11,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."

The U.S. also owes China $1.3 trillion: we borrow money from them, and they never borrow from us.

Trump’s China-bashing bravado is like a 4th-grader, in front of a television screen, shouting taunts at the bad guy in an old Schwarzenegger movie. China laughs at him. They know he’s just trying to take the attention off the miserable job he’s doing, as shown by his plummeting ratings."
2020-05-21 14:27:07,"The report says: ""...The rising prosperity of millions of Chinese has been a pillar of the Communist Party’s legitimacy ever since....""

""Legitimacy"" is a constant presence in propaganda against China's government. To be precise, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Modern China, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been in existence since 1949 for 71 years. China is one of the charter members of the United Nations and is one of five permanent members of its Security Council. 

In the last 40 years, China has lifted millions of its people out of abject poverty, and is now recognized by USA no less, as a legitimate challenger to its dominance as a world power. Read William Barr's official speech in February this year.

So why is this recurring question of ""legitimacy"" applied to China? Anyone who witness ""regime change"" and assassination of Iraq's Saddam Hussein should not be surprised. Challenging ""legitimacy"" of government by USA is a constant theme in its foreign policy. There are plenty of precedence, such as overthrowing the democratically elected Chilean president Salvador Allende, continuous effort to thwart Cuba's Castro, invasion of Pananma & Afgahnistan, attempted coup in Venezuela, etc.

Interestingly, one of the authors' brief bio says he has lived in China for most of the past 30 years. That's a rather long time to question CCP's legitimacy."
2020-05-21 14:14:13,"Communist propaganda has turned a disaster into a success story.  The initial suppression was definitely communistic.  Dr Li Wenliang did not behave like a communist.  He was not supposed to discuss this incident with his friends before the party central divulged it.  This is the hidden rules which ended so many officials in prison.   Whatever reporting rules of public health reporting has, it has to be subjected to administrative review.  That caused delay and increased the spread.

If mainland China were the only country which has succeeded in containing the virus spread, it definitely was the success of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  But, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and even Sweden have been successful.  They are not ruled by communists.  It is cultural.

For so long, CCP has tried to destroy Chinese culture.  Now it tries to snatch this success story from Chinese culture."

Fairy tales come true, if you only believe that your source of data is truthful, and often the source says as in ""the no spin zone"" they are the source of (truth). The manipulators want control, which they do today by media brainwashing, rather  than the use of force in the streets, cleaner not so much blood.  trump, China, Brazil, Hungary, Russia all want to lock down thought (fake news) and control our minds, they are counting on a uninformed passive citizenship.

2020-05-21 15:57:36,"Why is rallying national pride a bad thing? I have had two discussion classes online this week (with 1st -3rd year brainiac engineering students in China) speaking about images that represent the positive side of the Covid-19 outbreak. They brought in images from the Italian and Spanish balcony concerts to dolphins in Venice. Many were personal, learning to cook from necessity (parents who are both doctors) to pleasure (cream puffs). Learning to play guitar, studying for the GRE. The majority spoke of families, neighbourhoods, cities and the country coming together - making personal sacrifice for a common goal. They spoke of their Israeli professors sending PPE to Wuhan after a personal plea from a student whose mother was (and is) on the front line in Wuhan. Then, when Israel needed help the parents of our students gathered equipment to send to Haifa. Shouldn’t my students take pride in this? It’s not a manufactured emotion - Their sacrifice was personal - volunteering in the community wasn’t coerced - it came from the exact same place as if I were to volunteer at personal risk (except most North Americans haven’t been in this situation). This is long - but it angers me when the Chinese people are written about as manipulated robots. They aren’t. They are actually like many Americans I’ve met (Canadians are more smug about our niceness, less prideful about our greatness) except the young people have much more hope for their future."

From their government sponsored theft of intellectual property, their illegal takeover of Hong Kong, their suppression of the free press, and its people's absurd overreaction to any and all criticism as an affront to their national identity - China has proven to be a most dangerous world power.  

In the U.S. we are not experiencing a small taste of what it is like to have a leader that repeatedly lies and bends the truth, just like the Chinese people have been subjected to for decades.  Fortunately, we live in a country with a free press and a system that gives us an opportunity to ""right the ship"" when we sail into dangerous waters.  Democracy isn't perfect.  But it is far superior to Communism."

I find articles only about Wuhan in the Hubei province.  What about all the hundreds of other cities?  No info coming out about all the millions of other people?  The questions are not being asked with enough force.  I project that China has had 500.000 to one million deaths.  I'm not a mathematician and would welcome some insight."

2020-05-21 18:21:24,"All people at the top of pyramidal type organizations react to disorder with prioritizing restoring their control before they address the source of the disorder. Once they restore control, they become absorbed in new challenges and opportunities and so tend never to really confront what caused the disorder. This is how such organizations eventually become dysfunctional. 

The Communist state always puts loyalty and obedience above all facts that rely upon open minds and willingness to accept being wrong to accept and act upon. This is why when the virus was discovered, their first inclination was to suppress reporting of it beyond the government. It's why Hong Kong cannot be allowed to remain independent and operating under liberal philosophical principles. It's why the Soviet Union collapsed. The need to control simply ignores uncertainty and the need to be skeptical of every system that is founded upon certainty. 

Marxism is founded upon a hypothesis which is not confirmed by empirical evidence, historical determinism. Deterministic hypotheses are well established for the descriptions of natural forces in physics and the physical sciences. These forces have remained exactly the same since shortly after the big bang. They are immutable and can be expected to remain so. This was where Marx and the Marx-Leninist political systems are fundamentally flawed, they presume certainty about how history will eventually play out."

Cases:  China: 83,000  US:  1,590,000 

Deaths: China 4,634:   US:  94,276

 China has 1.4 billion souls while the US has 329 million or a population or just less than 1/4 that of China.

What is the reason we are literally the worst by far in the world when it comes to this pandemic?  

By every measure there is only one factor that can explain how the United States is failing so badly.

Failed Leadership by one man; enabled by a cult of followers who have sold out their principles in the name of blind loyalty to Trump's fiction of MAGA, a dreamlike state that never was.

There can be no other explanation. November cannot come soon enough. I fear a next wave of COVID-19 will come with a vengeance before that date because so many states and people are trying rush back to ""normalcy"" when nothing is normal.

I honestly do not know if international institutions even matter anymore in keeping the world from slipping into all out war again. The UN Security council was toothless in 2003, because the US and UK had a veto. That created a conflict whose ramifications are being felt across the world today.

Being a successful authoritarian leader requires serious effort and some demonstrable willingness to tackle difficult problems. He may handle the problems quite brutally but the necessary work gets done. 

Trump is a TV authoritarian. He simply wants to play the role in front of the cameras. The rest of the job fails to engage him. 

It is a very modern tragic flaw, suitable to the electronic media age.  But for the country at large, it may prove to be a blessing.

Dang Xiao Peng was the chief architect of Chinese sustainable market economy and since that time there is no going back. Deng was harsh in dealing with Tiananmen square student riots but having statue of liberty in heart of Beijing was a bit outrageous for Chinese government. 
American doesn't need to turn China from a friend to foe status but I think after Trump ouster in November Biden will have the foresight for respectable relations with China.
China's human rights record is not good but Americans have also faltered many times. President Xi is a visionary and quite a firm leader. It's for global peace to have better US Sino relations and Biden won't have any qualms about it!"
2020-05-21 21:53:36,"It’s a difficult time to be Chinese, especially if he/she doesn’t feel represented by their government.
With a constant focus on the CCP regime (inevitably), the individual experience of everyday Chinese people is missing. True, many of them are complacent and numb at this point, but not all are complicit, and they certainly all have families and lives, emotions and opinions, shaped by the epidemic, domestic politics, and international relations. 
No label accurately describes everyone in a country. When comments online make unspecified reference to “China” as a whole, accusing it for spreading COVID-19 to the world, how is a Chinese individual supposed to feel, with fresh memory of the horrible epidemic themselves, living under the ever tightening control of the big brother, while being confronted online or in life by global hostility? 
Do seek the truth about COVID-19, hold whoever failed to do their job accountable, but first see humanity in every individual, their sufferings, their struggles, and their aspirations."

2020-05-22 00:06:02,"""China’s leader is using the country’s success — and the criticism against it — to urge the party and the people to weather tough days ahead"".

OK, so? Is there anything wrong with it? At least China's success is real. US President uses a made-up ""success"" for the same purpose. Sinophobia of US media is getting downright obscene."
2020-05-21 17:54:53,"Let's boycott Communism. Xi and China's commie system are an affront to freedom and a rising military threat to global security.

Our preferential trade relationship with China has only helped China to oppress its own people while giving no incentive to allow democracy.

American should end our preferred trade partnership with China for many reasons including the deterrence of oppression over Chinese citizens and neighboring nations. We should balance most of our trade with democratic nations.

China is a police state dictatorship that maintains Orwellian surveillance (established using US technology), Internet censorship, a mass political prison system, mass slavery to produce cheap products and theft of American technology.

Allowing China continued preferred trade status assures that the Chinese will continue to rise as a dangerous military superpower.

If China wishes to have free and open trade with USA, they should establish authentic free elections nationwide and eliminate all censorship as a minimal requirement.

Until then we should boycott China as much as possible in favor of democratic nations. That could reduce Chinese tax revenues, thus potentially weakening the communists and eventually we might become true friends with a more liberated and democratic Chinese people. We don't help the Chinese people by trading with their fascist government.

We need to start making things in America again. Free Tibet. Free the damned up Mekong River. Free the Chinese people!"
2020-05-21 21:01:16,"Xi can say whatever he wants. It was his country that unleashed Covid and stopped the globe. 

The Chinese people are forced to nod and go along. 

Xi deserves every syllable of criticism hurled at him for allowing Covid to take over. Lest we conveniently forget, the NYT, WAPO and other Media outlets early on preached Covid was no big deal and pounced on Trump for closing incoming travel from China. Indeed, hatred for Trump is so over the top that Lefties blame the United States, not China, for Covid here, and heap sympathy on poor little China, poor little China. If we disallowed all travel from all other countries right away, and ended up with zero cases, the Left would still scream. Because then we'd be xenophobic! And more racist! bla bla bla.

Xi owes the United States and other countries trillions of dollars. The very least he could do is lift all tariffs on our goods, knock off threatening other countries, and quit eating bats. And torturing and eating dogs."
2020-05-19 10:55:32,I do not trust this person. He has lied from day one. Why should we trust him. This has all political implications and this is for  convince his base that is a leader. we have been on this path before. Do not take the bait.
2020-05-19 11:02:12,"Trump’s doctor would likely have been fired and replaced, had he not capitulated to the president’s demand for hydroxychloroquine.

That was the benefit that outweighed the risks.

2020-05-19 11:05:32,"We are dealing with a con man, don’t forget. The question is, What’s in this claim of Trump for him? And that, including distraction, should be obvious. Press reports like this one ... not to say these are not justified considering the office involved ... keep Trump’s con going. Trump, the con man, knows how to play people ... certainly the press, with which he has floor ... and his office facilitates this all the more."
2020-05-19 11:00:16,"Trump’s Washington Truth-seeking. Donald Trump’s tools for political truth-seeking are unorthodox and blunt instruments. Trump faces the ambiguous and emotionally disturbed and disturbing domain of truth created by his opponents who hate and despise the paradoxes about Trump and what he exposes in Washington DC. 
With Donald Trump’s bombastic style, a new glossary of terms is needed to understand his evolving policies and predict his way of leading. The new glossary would include words and concepts such as bravado, bombast, sarcasm (Cruel at times), overt insults, crude personal verbal attack, hyperbolic impulsive statements to focus large group attention, paradoxical intention, mixed simultaneous use of an object as symbol and reality. (I.e. an actual wall, a wall as the need for clear national boundaries, and acceptable rules of behavior reflecting the inner psychological mindfulness that comes with ego strength). And finally, extemporaneous free associations about the powerful emotions beneath political issues, ambivalent political relationships, and evolving policy statements."
2020-05-19 11:03:45,Trump isn't taking it. He is just saying he is. Why believe him now?
2020-05-19 10:43:26,"Yikes. 

I would have to ask why. The guy won't drink coffee or alcohol but he will take a powerful, off-book drug that may or may not but probably does not treat someone with an active case of coronavirus because he's ""heard a few things,"" so why not take it as a preventative? He's still the President. Does it make any sense at all that he would take hydroxychloroquine just because?"
2020-05-19 10:59:12,"It’s more likely he has lupus, RA, or even malaria than that he would be taking this medicine, of which one side effect is horrible dreams. On the other hand, it would explain the nightmarish tweets..."
2020-05-19 11:01:06,"Prove it. Let us see him take it each day, with verification from an independent source that he's really taking the drug and not a  lookalike placebo. Of course that's not going to happen, so this will just be added to the growing mountain of Trump lies."
2020-05-19 11:12:12,"I believe he is bluffing. He just wants his supporters to say ""yes, this is the bold man I like"". This has been his strategy all along, and how he won in 2016. Where is Biden hiding? He should come forward and say: ""Like Trump, I am taking 500 mg Tylenol every day because my house cleaner told me it prevents Corona virus infection"". This is how he can make the news media talk less about Trump and bring attention toward him, with a good laugh! Sadly, many, including the news media don't understand Trump, and they respond to his vain statements seriously!"
2020-05-19 11:07:20,"The problem isnt really trump taking the drugs. Honestly who cares if he does sick after taking a few of those? The real problem is that this action is a manifestation of his carelessness and arrogance in handling the situation, rather than prompting cooperation and displaying effective leadership. 

Yes, the problem is also on China. But the other half of the problem is your inability to deal with such an emergency and better the national healthcare system. This is just one of the symptoms caused by the disease named a corrupt and inefficient healthcare system. I urge mr trump to stop putting the blame on random ppl and confront the actual problem."
2020-05-19 11:11:33,If Trump is really taking the med and suffers serious side effects he will sue Dr Conley for medical malpractice. Obviously Conley doesn't know about Trump's suit-prone history.
2020-05-19 11:03:15,"As a physician who has tried hydroxychloroquine on a few patients, I was furious when I heard this. The time and resources wasted with urgent research to demonstrate this drug does nothing and is likely dangerous will never be recouped.

Why promote it now? The New England Journal of Medicine published the results of over a thousand patients and demonstrated no benefit. The VA showed the mortality of patients taking this drug is double that of those not taking it. Utter foolishness.

Just when I thought I would stop defending Trump's federal response to COVID-19, which otherwise I thought was coordinated and mostly effective, he criticized the WHO.  Honestly, I think this is more important and restored my willingness to defend this administration.

Those of you who defend the response of the WHO please explain the scientific reason for opposing a travel ban from Wuhan on January 24?  Please explain what control measures would be effective if international travel from coronavirus hot spots is allowed?

From the time this epidemic became evident and China suppressed news, lied about its infectivity, and punished doctors for exposing it the WHO enabled their behavior. Refusing to use my tax dollars to support their behavior is a cause worth applauding Trump for not matter how stupid he is with his personal behavior.

The federal response to COVID19 especially Operation Warp Speed will produce a vaccine, if it will be produced. The WHO has nothing to offer us.

Godspeed Donald!"

2020-05-19 11:28:11,"His biggest problem is that nobody believes anything he says... even if a few things he say occasionally might be true.

The life of the boy who cried wolf.

He's obvioulsy taking 200mg/day, not the 800 or 1000mg/day that sick Corona patients have been given.

At 200mg, its a powerful immunosupressant that sarcoid and lupus patients take. Doctors all over the world are taking this 200mg dose for that reason.

He probably won't get the virus.

I cant stand the guy, and would never vote for him, but what I wrote above, is legit."
2020-05-19 11:33:02,"Trump knows that his campaign will benefit from his taking ""the hydroxy.""  He knows this because the right wing's war against public education has been very successful."

Can tax records be next?"
2020-05-19 11:34:59,I'll believe it when his doctor announces that. He's just grabbing attention today. All the exasperation expressed in comments here is just what he wants: To be thought to be invincible.

2020-05-19 11:54:09,"Phenol (carbolic acid) is one of the oldest antiseptic agents, discovered in 1834 and then used by Dr. Lister of ""Listerine"" fame  in 1867 who early on experimented with it for various medicinal uses.   In the late 1800's it was widely available as an antiseptic and is still used today in oral sore-throat sprays in safe concentrations as well as other analgesic and antiseptic preparations   

Sometimes self-medicating or even touching chemicals you have little or no knowledge about can have disastrous effects.  

  “What do you have to lose?”  

 Perhaps my great grandmother who died in 1894 in NYC at age 25 from carbolic acid(phenol) poisoning should have asked that same question."
2020-05-19 11:49:17,"“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he had been taking the drug for about a week and a half, with the approval of the White House physician. “I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,” Mr. Trump continued, explaining that his decision to try the drug was based on one of his favorite refrains: “What do you have to lose?”

It's unfortunate that Dr. Trump missed the week in elementary school when they tackled the scientific method and then didn't pick up on it when it was referred to in his later education.  Probably, the bone spurs in his feet were to blame.  As far as I'm concerned, he can ingest anything his genius inspires, but I'm concerned that those who believe he's preaching the gospel will follow suit and suffer accordingly.  It's ironic that I'm far more concerned for his true believers' health than he is, but his lack of concern for people depending on him is also indicative of how he has lived his entire life.  If the hydroxy bill becomes too steep for him, I'm more than willing to chip in to maintain his supply."
2020-05-19 11:51:24,"""Prompting criticism"" is a fairly passive way of describing the reaction to Trump's strange self-medicating regimen.

Other than Rudy Giuliani, I haven't read nor heard of any respectable physician or health care expert endorse Trump's action. Not one. About the mildest reaction was along this line: ""It is not recommended that anyone take this drug unless for its prescribed use.""

Still, watch demand for hydroxychloroquine sky rocket. That's what generate outrage"
2020-05-19 11:57:42,"I am concerned for the quality of care that the white house physician provides.  A physician should not give in to bullying by a patient if the patient demands treatment that is potentially dangerous and with no current indication. This is not considered the community standard of care, which would protect a physician from a malpractice complaint."
2020-05-19 11:48:10,"I don't really care about the dangers the unproven drug for COVID-19 protection poses for Trump.

What I DO care and worry about is the reckless and irresponsible example Trump is setting.  

So, this is the mindset of a true ""leader""?

This is the person that people say is doing a great job and want around for another four years?

If Trump is indeed taking hydroxychloroquine because he thinks it will protect him from the virus, well, that's bad enough.

But if Trump is NOT taking it but is broadcasting that he is, what kind of message is THAT he is sending?

The answer of irresponsible behavior answers both scenarios."

He was quite upset over this interview, tweet attacking all involved throughout the evening. So the following day, he said that HE was taking it and that many hospital workers on the front line are taking it. Not only are front line workers NOT taking this drug but neither is HE.  President Trump's motives are generally quite transparent, besides often being dangerous."
2020-05-19 12:22:17,"Won't wear a mask, but touts a medication with potentially dangerous side effects as a preventative (not as a treatment under controlled conditions, but as a preventative, which means it's likely more people will rush to buy it).

2020-05-19 12:15:16,"Look closely. The statement released by his doctor is very carefully worded. It does not say that the president is taking the medication.  Trump said he is.  But his doctor, not wanting to be complicit in the lie, won't say it."
2020-05-19 12:20:16,"Perhaps he's depending on the placebo effect to fortify his believers for their return to  contagion-prone workplaces.

Wouldn’t it it be a violation of some rule to give a prescriptions for a drug to treat a condition you don’t have?"
2020-05-19 12:06:38,The final attack on the village.  If President Trump had a financial stake in hydroxychloroquine production at least he would show evidence for understanding cause and effect.  Anecdotal evidence for a side effect of medically-induced paranoia due to hydroxychloroquine makes me hope White House doctors are giving a placebo.  And the White House press corps should be asking if his rheumatoid arthritis has dissipated.  The entire meltdown of the President and his Administration reminds me of Seven Samurai and the bandits trapped in the village during the final assault.

He should have been the first to don a mask, if for nothing else then give an example of seriousness and further emphasize the gravity of the situation.

Why is he taking HCQ at all (if he is saying truth)?  No one ever said that it can prevent the scourge, from what I know.  We do not even know if it acts at all, he himself was loud and clear on that.

Finally, it is not as if he is taking m&m every morning so we can too, if we feel like it.  What if a random person wants to start the day with HCQ?  No way no how for very long time.  And we all know that it can be baloney."

First and foremost, he would never take anything that would imperil his health.

Second and most important, Trump’s lying far outweighs his telling the truth. By a margin of 100 to 1.

Third, and probably most telling, he owns stock in the company that makes it.

If Trump can make money hand over fist, and if just one person takes Hydroxychloroquine and survives Covid-19, then he is a self-proclaimed genius.

Trump LIES...about EVERYTHING.

He even lies when he doesn't have to, just to keep people confused and off-balance.  Trump wouldn't risk his life to take an unproven drug.  He loves himself too much.  He's lying about taking hydroxychloroquine to distract public attention from: his firing of FOUR Inspectors General in one week, Pompeo's use of a government employee as a dishwasher, Barr's latest attempt to undermine the rule of law, Don, Jr. calling Joe Biden a ""pedophile,"" the Supreme Court debating the release of Trump's tax returns, etc.

Where is the oversight?

trump has never acted as a leader, but is he now trying to lead by example? How many people will his example kill?

If it was possible to remove trump from office yesterday, it still would be long overdue. November can’t come too soon. The summer is dead anyway. Anybody with a brain will do what’s necessary to avoid being infected by the likely second coronavirus wave.

Others will follow his lead, howver, and take the drug, further diminishing the supply of hydroxychloroquine for people who really need it.

he is making money of this...no way is he taking it"
2020-05-19 11:37:59,Not a risk at all.  The man has no heart.
2020-05-19 11:39:51,Let’s encourage trump supporters to take hydroxycloroquine.  As trump states it can’t hurt.
2020-05-19 11:41:42,"While it hasn't been established that hydroxychloroquine works against Covid-19, it's been well-established that Trump doesn't."
2020-05-19 11:54:14,"Come  on people, he’s  lying. Just like he does about everything else.  Why are we even talking about this?"
2020-05-19 11:09:03,"“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” President Trump said

Again, the vast majority of the country disagrees.  Paraphrasing Marcellus Wallace, ""You're pretty dang far from okay."""
2020-05-19 11:14:49,Sure he is.  That’s as true as his “bone spurs” when he whimped out of the draft.
2020-05-19 11:38:02,"I don’t believe him. He’s a pathological liar. He makes stuff up on the spot. He says whatever he thinks will work for him in the moment, and lying about this would make him look like some hero to his base. At this point, almost four years out, there isn’t one thing he could say that I would believe unless I saw it happening right in front of me."
2020-05-19 10:42:01,"I don't believe he's taking hydroxychloroquine. He says he does, but I don't think he does. I believe him only to try rowing his leaking boat ashore. He wouldn't dare stand on TV having a medical doctor administering that medicine to him.

To believe the US is governed by a man who has it as a hobby to boss people around and go for grabs as soon as he has the opportunity. I wish his hobby and passion would be the good of the US and of the world."
2020-05-19 11:47:45,"Of course the pathological liar is doing what he does best, lying. And the conman is doing what he does best conning his followers.
And the sociopath is doing what he does best, not caring about the deaths he is causing by withholding an organized national program to save lives. This is his American Carnage."
2020-05-19 11:24:25,He's lying. I don't believe anything he says.
2020-05-19 11:32:07,"We have been subject to a ""mad"" president these 3 1/2 years.  The world has been subject to this mad president.  How utterly frightening this has been."
2020-05-19 11:33:35,"Is he actually taking it? Or is he lying... and this is another one of his tactics to simply spark his base to ""question"" truth and foment distrust in experts. See... if he claims he's taking it, and all the experts warn of serious consequences, but then there are no serious consequences because he's not taking it, then his base can run around and claim that the experts were wrong about the consequences. I wouldn't put it past him.

Many of us are quick to say Trump is stupid or he ""just doesn't care about lives."" I think it's worse than that. He sows division by making people question the truth. So by saying things like ""what have I got to lose?"" or ""are these death counts trustworthy?"" - he's not actually lying. He's just using a skeptical question to create a distrust for experts - and then he can't technically be wrong since he's just questioning. That's what's so scary about these tactics. That's why you see so many voters ""in the middle"" sway towards the right - because the simple questions aren't crazy enough to turn them away, but just interesting enough to hook them in."
2020-05-19 11:34:01,"We have a fool for president.  All the world knows this.  In fact, everyone seems to know this except for the fool  himself.

Abusing prescription drugs is not the wisest choice one can make.  And what about the physician writing the prescription?  Why does he still have his license?

This makes me wonder what other drugs is Trump running on?"
2020-05-19 12:03:43,"He accomplished what he wanted, he has distracted the media and everyone yet again.
You know is isn't taking it, why give it more than a sentence or two when reporting it?"
2020-05-19 11:41:39,"Presumably, Dr. Sean P. Conley has been in close contact with Trump.  Is he taking the hydroxycloroquine?  If not, why not?

If the drug is so great and you firmly believe in it's cure or prophylactic power- why isn't Ivanka, Melania, Kushner and the entire family not taking it?"
2020-05-19 11:50:21,"I don't believe it either, like other comments.  The NYT has great investigative powers and should use them to learn whether this is a distraction like I and others think or a fact."
2020-05-19 10:53:48,I simply do not believe him.
2020-05-19 12:28:02,"Trump is obese, doesn't exercise and apparently subsists on junk food. Really poor example for the little kiddies."
2020-05-19 12:27:56,He looks horrible. As for the doctor who prescribed it. He's as idiotic as Trump. Taking the drug has not been proven effective against fighting the virus. The health risks associated with taking the drug outweigh any possible benefits. Here we have another case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing in the Trump White House.
2020-05-19 12:25:40,"While I was returning to complete my Fulbright Fellowship project in the Amazon basin, I and a small group of colleagues were taking Hydroxychloroquine. It caused us to become extremely irrational and this side affect was after two days our initial first dosage. Perhaps trump has been on this anti-Malaria drug for the past few decades."
2020-05-19 12:26:17,"It's interesting that Tweety Amin's WH doctor released a letter that says they discussed the risk, but he never *explicitly* says he prescribed it -- or even that Tweety is taking it. So I remain skeptical of this claim by the Liar-in-Chief. If nothing happens to him (regardless if he's on it or not) he can claim to his cultists that the drug is 'safe' and that his super-duper-stable-jenius was right again.

Remember, he's desperately flailing around for anything he can say makes him look 'strong' to his base ahead of November. However, IMO, his refusal to wear a mask when *everyone* around him is doing so doesn't make him look 'strong' -- it makes him look out-of-touch, uncaring, and/or the one that's offensive to everyone. Frankly I'm surprised some of those photos from last week aren't virally captioned ""boy, doesn't he know how badly he reeks?""

I also want to know what happened in January that caused him to take an unexpected trip to Bethesda that Saturday. It clearly wasn't for a routine ""part 1"" of his annual physical."
2020-05-19 11:51:18,Something is not adding up.  A doctor would not prescribe this as a preventative.  The truth is obvious :  Trump has tested positive  for COVID-19 and they are desperately trying to cover it up.
2020-05-19 11:58:59,"If what he is saying is true, it's very welcome news.  A cardiac arrhythmia problem might finish the man off- and save American lives.  Let's hope and pray."
2020-05-19 12:14:00,"Yes, this might be a lie but his cult will follow his lead. If he is lucky enough to remain Covid free he will tout the benefits of going maskless and using the drug with a ""see I told you"" moment. The tragedy here is that people who have rheumatoid arthritis will find it difficult to get the drug that truly benefits them. I guess his MD succumbed to pressure and remained loyal, that's why he hasn't been fired yet. An embarrassment to the medical profession."
2020-05-19 11:41:08,I'm sure his physician enjoyed printing a label out in Powerpoint and filling the container with sugar pills. The child safety lock on the cap must have made the President believe what he is taking is a serious drug.
2020-05-19 12:06:15,The Costanza Rule indicates that tRump is not actually taking the medication and is just lying.  But I do encourage him to take it on a regular basis.
2020-05-19 11:50:16,I don`t believe for a moment that he`s taking the medicine. Another dangerous distraction.
2020-05-19 12:23:23,"I used to take the same anti-malarial drugs Trump's been taking, but only when I visited countries where malaria was widespread.   The drugs had many side-effects, especially at night.  Perhaps this explains why the president is so erratic."
2020-05-19 12:20:15,So he would need a prescription. Physicians take the Hippocratic oath.  Is a physician really going to risk prescribing this to the President? What dose was he prescribed? Is he thinking if one pill is good two is better. As others indicate is he lying as he tend to do. Just talking to his base. Either way taking drugs to take drugs or lying sets a bad example. I wonder what Barron thinks of Dad's drug usage?
2020-05-19 12:29:00,"I'm an M.D.  

PLEASE don't take this medication unless it's prescribed for something it can actually help with, such as SLE or other autoimmune disorders.  I treat a few people on this medication for autoimmune disorders and they're very upset/scared that they may not be able to get this very needed medication due to people following the lead of the President.  It's a very scary time for them in many ways, please don't make it worse."
2020-05-19 12:24:22,"Lots of drugs have warnings like  ""don't operate machinery after taking this dose ""  ( I know somebody who nearly wrecked his car when he wasn't careful about the warning).   Is it possible that the drug could be impairing his judgement further than normal?"
2020-05-19 12:07:45,An attempt to distract us from his firing of the State Dept. Inspector General who was investigating illegal arms sales to the Saudis. This playbook is getting old and tired.
2020-05-19 12:18:31,Here's some sage advice to follow. Take anything Trump says and believe the opposite.
2020-05-19 11:56:42,"Does anyone in their right mind really believe that he is taking this?  He's doing it to get his followers to take it, thus increasing the stock price.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself.  It's true - we could all die and he wouldn't care unless it affects his wallet."
2020-05-19 11:32:22,Considering the known risks would a doctor really prescribe such a dangerous drug for the US president. Could he be taking a placebo labelled as the drug?
2020-05-19 11:50:56,"I don’t believe it....But when Trump says something outrageous like him taking this drug of questionable benefit, immediately EVERY major news outlet reports on it with all the associated editorials and opinions. Mister Trump is now on the front page of every news website. I get the sense that that is his purpose in saying is is taking the drug. Are we being manipulated?"
2020-05-19 12:21:44,He's taking a drug that doesn't work for a condition he doesn't have?  And a doctor approved this?
2020-05-19 10:51:55,"Trumpo supposedly has had a history of cardiac problems.

It would be highly improbable therefore that any doctor would prescribe Hydro to him under the circumstances.

I don’t believe he’s taking it and won’t unless and until he submits to a blood test with an independent lab."
2020-05-19 12:29:13,He's lying.
2020-05-19 12:30:31,"It seems the public announcement that the POTUS is taking a drug proven to be dangerous and not effective in treating what he is taking it for has been met with either amusement, indifference or in the cult, praise.
This is what three very long years with Trump as president has done to us.
Just another day with editorial silence, Democratic irony, Republicans hiding and the rest of us thinking when will we wake up from this nightmare?"
2020-05-19 12:30:36,"Either he is lying, in some sick retaliation move against Dr Bright.

Or he is taking it because he freaked out about the positive tests in the WH. 

This could go either way, which is tragic in itself as it means there is no way to ever take a single utterance at face value. 

The doctor’s letter does not explicitly say it was prescribed or being administered, which is obviously meant to insulate him from either perjury or malpractice. 

God. Bless. America."
2020-05-19 12:30:33,He’s lying.
2020-05-19 12:08:04,"Oh that Donald, he is such a rebel! Leader of the pack!"
2020-05-19 12:14:10,Donald Trump is the definition of a snake oil salesman.
2020-05-19 12:14:35,"Don, you're the greatest. You're too smart to fall for far left propaganda about hydroxychloroquine being ineffective. It's an elaborate fake news con to hide the fact that your current treatment plan is insufficient.

An appropriate dose of hydroxychloroquine guarantees that you'll never get covid-19. Not only that, the drug also cures stupid permanently.

With the unlimited powers at your command, immediately quadruple your dosage and show 'em who's in charge!"
2020-05-19 12:15:52,"C'mon. Reporting 101. Did the White House physician (paid with our tax dollars) actually approve this? How big is the dose?  (If he doesn't know, that's a clue he's not taking it.) These are reporting basics, but the New York Times would rather play Internet ""journalism,"" report whatever the president says as what actually happened, and then scour for comments nilly willy to fill space -- versus getting to the facts."
2020-05-19 12:17:09,"Didn't I hear, just when trump started talking about hydroxychloroquine,that trump had a financial stake in it??I don't believe for one second that he's taking it.He needs a win, be it a financial one,a fake one with a ""miracle drug"",anything that will distract from his idiotic claim that this dreadful pandemic would be gone by 5/15/20.I'm sick of his lies and I'm sick of ""winning""."
2020-05-19 12:22:35,"Well, this is a first. A snake oil salesman drinking his own snake oil. At least he hasn't blamed witchcraft as the source of coronavirus and started burning liberals and Democrats at the stake. Yet."
2020-05-19 12:27:20,"Can you imagine what Fox “News” would sound like this morning if President Obama had made such a claim? The Kenyan Muslim wants to kill as many Americans as he can... and it would play on repeat until the end of time. 

Glad Neil Cavuto wants no part of the skullduggery at Fox, and I wish he’d leave the network because he’s too classy and intelligent to work there. But who is benefiting financially from the promoting of this drug? That’s what we need to keep asking. I’m sure the answer includes some people affiliated with Fox."
2020-05-19 12:18:58,Scariest person in the world is the one who ways knows best in all areas and who trusts no one else's knowledge or expertise. Trump always knows more in every area than everyone else. The secret knkwledge is the contrarian knowledge. The so-called experts are the real fools.
2020-05-19 12:32:44,"Come on!  Who believes he is taking the drug?!  I mean, besides his wondrous cult, of course.  Gimme a break.  If his lips are moving, he is lying."
2020-05-19 12:32:38,"It’s typical trump. No mask, a drug not approved, no heart attack. All lie. All trump."
2020-05-19 12:36:34,"I hope that the State medical board where his physician has a license is reviewing this.  Medical boards are created to ensure the safety of the public.  In addition to compromising his patient's health by prescribing something where harm is more likely than benefit, he has inadvertently harmed many more due to the irresponsible verbiage of the nation's leader, whom many (fortunately not the majority) turn to for means to deal with a crisis."
2020-05-19 12:10:36,Is he trying to eliminate the people who'll vote for him?
2020-05-19 12:36:43,Th website for Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) contains a lengthy list of common and potential side effects associated taking the drug.  Vision problems is one possible side effect and patients taking the drug receive periodic peripheral vision tests to assess their vision.  The drug also has potential interactions with other medications a person may be taking.  It is abundantly clear that the drug should only be prescribed and taken for approved uses or in trials.  The President’s physician should provide a public explanation for why he prescribed this drug for Mr. Trump.
2020-05-19 12:30:39,"Ratings, folks, ratings!  Stayed tuned."
2020-05-19 12:35:32,"President Trump is a grown man and take whatever drugs he wants. Announcing that he is taking hydroxychloroquine was not an endorsement of the drug, he was just stating a fact. The jury is still out on the efficacy of the drug against COVID-19. I challenge the highly educated to open their minds and research the issue themselves; do a Google search on “scientific research on hydroxychloroquine,” and you will find dozens of articles on the topic. One article for example, “Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,” published in the journal, Cell Discovery, on March 18, 2020, suggests that hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing COVID-19 infection in laboratory experiments; and the drug is used in some hospital settings to curb infection. My only reservation about the article is that it is written entirely by Chinese scientists. It is really a shame that the left has politicized this public health crisis for political gain during an election year. It may comeback to bite them. Cheers!"
2020-05-19 12:36:53,"The White House doc confirmed  that Trump is taking the drug while remaining ""symptom free."" An Interesting fact to note. Trump is tested daily. If the tests have been negative, there would no reason to assume that Trump would be showing symptoms and no reason for the the doc to find that noteworthy.

If, on the other hand, Trump contracted the virus and was given the drug as a treatment, then the lack of symptoms would be a signs of its effectiveness. But, of course, Trump being the soul of transparency, as he says here, would let his subjects know he was sickened so we could at least pray for him. I hear he's a very religious guy, too. How silly of me to speculate."
2020-05-19 12:38:18,"Is he really taking this drug or is this his way of
bolstering his past claims with no risk to himself?
If he is, the Court Physician should resign to 
protect what remains of a professional 
reputation.  Meanwhile, millions will be watching
for side-effects on an older, morbidly-obese male."
2020-05-19 12:02:35,"""Dr. Steven E. Nissen, the chief academic officer of the Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said he had treated patients who developed a life-threatening arrhythmia, which (hydroxychloroquine) can cause.""

Contrarily, our Smarter-than-all-of-the-Surgeons General is self-medicating and cheering for college football stadiums to be packed.

Days left until we end the internship of The White House Quack: 168. 

His practice will be moving to D-List Celebrityville."
2020-05-19 11:58:34,"If it is true that Trump has the endorsement of the White House physician to take hydroxychloroquine for the alleged purpose of preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2, it can essentially be considered malpractice. Not only has the drug not been shown to be of any benefit in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 to date, it can have serious toxic effects, including fatal arrhythmias. It is not considered standard of care in the medical community for this purpose. Enough with so many readers' comments that claim they know what they are talking about. Even some physicians are getting it wrong. The amount of misinformation out there is staggering.

While I do not care about Trump, I do care about the harm this will cause because now even more​ people around the country will hoard this drug and take it for the same reason as their beloved president and it WILL cause harm. Patients have had to be withdrawn from treatment in the studies that were being conducted in patients with COVID-19 because of abnormalities of their EKGs that put them at serious risk for a fatal arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de point). This is just another reason to add to the enormous list of reasons why Trump is a danger to this country and it's citizens."
2020-05-19 12:32:10,"According to news reports, Trump has lied more than 18,000 times since the outdated Electoral College declared him president. My guess is he owns shares in the company that makes this product and is trying to raise the share price so he can make $$.

Trump has no shame, no dignity, nor compassion for the pain his constituents are suffering. We're merely subjects he can abuse to inflate his bottom line.  The days cannot pass fast enough until the Nov election (assuming he doesn't declare Martial Law and cancel it)."
2020-05-19 12:14:44,"We have no idea if he's taking it or note.  He lies so much, much of it for attention, that who knows, and in the end, who cares?

Well I care about those who think he's a saint or an oracle and will follow his lead.  They could assume various health risks, based on the inaccurate statements this attention hound makes (I know a lot of people who are taking it, ""they say"" it really helps, yada yada yada).

Stop reporting on all his insanities--that's the way to really help your readers and US citizens in general"
2020-05-19 11:23:11,"Remember what happened to Michael Jackson when he convinced a doctor to give him something that was ill-advised.

They say the rich and famous get worse care than the rest of us because they can always find a doctor to give them the treatment they want. 

If he did in fact prescribe this for Donald Trump, perhaps the White House doctor should be reviewed by his licensing board.￼"
2020-05-19 12:37:40,"Here is a man who rates an extremely generous 1 out of 10 on transparency, revealing willingly that he is taking hydroxychloroquine, raising eyebrows. Naturally, you find it hard to believe, so follow the paper trail. Who prescribed it? Who filled the order? Does Secret Service protection include medications taken by a President? Are there NDAs?"
2020-05-19 11:56:45,"The only and favorite trump medicine is and has been the lie serum. It doesn't get sick, but it destroys everything"
2020-05-19 11:57:01,"“I take it because I think I hear very good things,” Mr. Trump said. He does not even appear to be sure he is hearing good things, but thinks he is. Thinking that you are hearing things is sometimes referred to as an auditory hallucination. 25th amendment anyone?"
2020-05-19 12:40:44,"I'd like to know which pharmaceutical company makes it and if the Trump family is invested. Money, money, money."
2020-05-19 12:40:49,"Does anyone actually believe he's taking this drug? Come on. Too much of a wimp to test the side effects. He's simply convincing his followers, once again, that COVID-19 is already under control and curable. Just another smoke bomb and dangerous scheme to boost his version of the economy to improve his re-election chances.  

If hydroxychloroquine is so effective and safe, he should have no problem having his children and their spouses take it, then head out on the streets and into the grocery stores for a week. They'd never last an hour."
2020-05-19 12:38:41,Another lie. I believe he has a financial interest in a company that manufactures hydroxychloroquine. When he first mentioned the drug in March requests for prescriptions went through the roof. If an American company is the first to come up with a vaccine for COVID 19 he willl do everything in his power to monetize the situation for himself and hold the world hostage to get it. And the Republicans will just watch.
2020-05-19 12:07:45,"You can't legally get it without a prescription, and a doctor wouldn't prescribe it for someone Trump's age unless they had the virus (or malaria).

I doubt Trump has malaria. So, I suspect he's positive for the virus, and still refusing to wear a mask."
2020-05-19 12:07:17,"This is simply classic Trump misdirection: it gives him a headline, he knows none of HIS base will disapprove, and it takes attention away from substantive issues.

That to most thinking people his comments sounded idiotic does not bother him in the least. We do all know that by now - don't we? We  were all paying attention to HIM right? 
And when we go off - reporters and readers alike - into conjectures about what kind of a physician would prescribe this med against all of the precautions, we are entering into  the onetine Modern Screen / now TMZ arena where personal quirks are""news.""

In the mean time - there's the little matter of the fired IG and Pompeo,  and a deadly virus, and incomplete plans to allow mail-in voting and health care concerns.

If Trump wishes to set himself up for heart problems, I say go for it. Take three pills a day. But I do not believe one word out of that mouth."
2020-05-19 12:29:37,"Follow the money.  Big Pharma can make billions from this pandemic, if and only if they can patent an expensive drug that controls the markets.  But there is a little bump in the road called hydroxychloroquine that is readily available, much cheaper and considered generic.  

The establishment, including the NYT, is doing everything it can to talk down hydroxchloroquine, even if it hurts patients who need it the most.  We are witnessing the sacrificing of lives for the almighty dollar.  How sad."
2020-05-19 11:32:20,"This way past the time that we should have acted one way or another to take this person out of our highest office. We had the chance in the Senate impeachment trial, we have the 25th Amendment. We will have to use the election in November. We can make a clean sweep of it. So much damage has been done. So much damage is STILL being done. We don't even know if this liar is taking the questionable drug, but in so doing he is setting an example for others. As well, if he is, and whatever he suffers mentally or physically from it, he has all the powers of the presidency to use, maliciously, vindictively, even moreso."
2020-05-19 11:13:04,"Maybe Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, maybe he's not.  Even if his physician testified to it, you would still question if you were being told the truth."
2020-05-19 12:16:21,"Who is the White House physician, Dr. Giggles? Handing out prescriptions based on Trump’s whims endangers not just Trump (not that I care), but also the people gullible enough to follow Trump’s lead and, saddest of all, the millions of people who actually need this medication."
2020-05-19 12:17:24,"Well who wrote the prescription?
Does Trump think no laws apply to him?"
2020-05-19 12:12:01,"Either he’s lying, or the doctor prescribing it - apparently prophylactically, to an obese man with heart disease -  should lose his license."
2020-05-19 11:22:04,"If any parent were giving this to their minor children, it would warrant a call to a child welfare agency.
 Medical abuse."
2020-05-19 11:23:23,“I take it because I think I hear very good things.”  There you have it.  He is hearing voices telling him to do dangerous things.  This guy shouldn’t be in the Oval Office.  He should be in an asylum.
2020-05-19 11:31:14,We should not be at all surprised that a carnival barker can have a second career as a snake oil salesman.
2020-05-19 11:47:06,"I'm getting a bad case of fatigue over media tornadoes deliberately created by Trump's ""bombshells"".  They tend to either not adversely affect his base (and his attempts to expand it), or else to give the base a shot of adrenaline.  They tend to shift the reigning horror headline to something far more favorable to Trump.  

What I find surprising is that the new media continue to elevate these silly concept bombs that Trump regularly drops as if they should be  (or even can be)  analyzed as a serious news event."
2020-05-19 11:24:39,What is actually more astonishing than promoting and taking a medication with absolutely no evidence that it has a any efficacy whatsoever is that he is our president.
2020-05-19 11:59:17,"Well, I think this settles the question whether Trump is openly giving out insider trading information to his corrupt corporate benefactors. ""Buy Mylan and Novartis stocks now. I'll announce behind closed doors when to sell.""

We will probably never know if the Chosen One is taking the drug hydroxychloroquine drug that he claims is protecting him from the coronavirus because most of us excepting his MAGA maggot base of ""fine people"" have come to expect anything that comes out of Dr. Trump's mouth is a lie. 

But what the Master of Mendacity has done once again is to deflect from the pandemic which so far has taken over 90,000 lives in America. 

It is a number that would be much lower had he not ignored the virus when he exclaimed loudly and defiantly early this year that it was just a bad cold or mild flu which would magically disappear. 

Surely Dr. Trump who claims to possess ""great and unmatched wisdom"" needs no additional excuses to avoid being held accountable for his ignorance and arrogance during the pandemic which continues to claim lives and jobs in our country. As he announced in March, ""I don't take responsibility at all."" 

Maybe the Chosen One's ingesting the hydroxychloroquine drug will control his raging fever."
2020-05-19 11:18:51,"If he is actually taking the drug, and given Trump's history of casually bending the truth in the direction of a lie he may not be, the question that needs to be answered is - why is he taking this drug? Why take a drug if there's no need? Is he sick? Does he think this will safeguard him from exposure to the several people who have tested positive for COVID-19 that he was in contact with in the White House? Who takes a drug to prove some kind of dubious point when there's no need to take it."
2020-05-19 12:11:11,"Another vulgar manipulation of sensation to distract from his job, which is accountable for 90,000 casualties, several dozen million out of work and the obliteration of trillions in American net worth.

2020-05-19 12:42:39,"The intense pushback, in some quarters, to the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine was surprising.

Had there been a finding, that the biology of Covid-19 heightened the body's susceptibility to the known side effects of hydroxychloroquine, then the pushback could have been defensible. I am not aware of any such finding.

The use of off-label drugs is not uncommon."

It has been suggested it might have an activity in coronavirus, perhaps reducing the effects of a cytokine storm in advanced disease. In any case, because it is an immune suppressor, taking it prophylactically is a really dumb idea.  It may well make someone more susceptible to getting an initial coronavirus infection in the first place, and thereafter cause the infection to be more serious than it otherwise would have been."

2020-05-19 11:23:53,"Trump, this pathological liar, this bottomless pit of need, waits 2 weeks to tell the reporters he so desperately wants to impress that he’s taking chloroquine? Not likely.

More plausible is that the thought scampered through his mind that those reporters might say something nice to him if they thought he was walking the walk, arm-in-arm with the “Frontline Healthcare Workers,” and that thought then quickly exited through his mouth."

Anecdotally, in my own experience, zinc helps with fighting the common cold - also a coronavirus. There are clinical trials going on now by reputable institutions because it holds promise. This is something the public should know about because it is relatively inexpensive, easy to get, won’t take away from people who really need it, comes with few side effects, and may lessen the duration and severity of the disease."

There’s no doubt in my mind, in these desperate times, when people are crying out for a preventative measure to COVID-19, a drug company has paid President Donald J. Trump to say he is using their drug Hydroxychloroquine.

Follow the money. 
The only thing that makes sense is this. He’s been paid a truckload of money, as he and his brand have been paid to do deals all his life. It’s nothing but a deal to him, and misery and gross neglect and even death for the poor souls who believe him and take this unproven drug.

He never took any drug. He’s there for number one.  Sell the drug, take the money, move on. Deflect the blame. That’s the way Trump does business.

Just check with some of your hospitals, I am sure some are still using it."
2020-05-19 13:15:52,"First of all, he didn't suggest that injecting disinfectants into the human body could help combat the virus.   What is wrong with you people, cannot you know tell a straight story?  Can't you avoid twisting what Trump says in order to bash him.  He asked, after a presentation how various things like sunlight, alcohol and disinfectants reduced the half life of CV-19.  He asked the doctors in attendance at the press conference if that info could be used to help therapeutically those who had CV-19.  That's a huge difference.  

As to whether he's taking it or not, why would he lie?  And as whether it's a risk, his doctor per this article said the possible benefits outweigh the risks.  Hydroxychloroquine has been in use for decades so the risks are reasonably well known.  It may not work as a prophylactic against CV-19, but taking it shouldn't create much of a risk so, what is the hysteria about, except it's Trump.

Imagine if Obama were still president and he decided to take a drug of some sort to ward off CV-19.  The left would praise his insight and bravery.  Please.  This is just another chance the left is taking to bash Trump."

He has undermined the justice department, the intelligence agencies, the congress, NATO, and now in the boldest terms he is spitting in the face of medical training."
2020-05-19 13:17:06,"I keep asking myself why NOW?  

Why would Trump take this stuff or say he's taking this stuff?  

He gets tested every day and those results have been negative.  

More harm than good can result from this drug, especially if there is no medical justification for taking it.

I keep wondering if he has stock tied to this drug and for him to promote it like he is, wouldn't his stock increase?

I have not a clue why he does what he does, but clearly there is some underlining reason for his action or statement.

Meanwhile, social distancing and the wearing of face masks as preventative and cautionary acts against the virus continue to be tossed aside and not adhered to in the White House.

Such contradictory and irresponsible behavior will be remembered in November."
2020-05-19 12:47:48,"Its a placebo.  His doctor could lose his license for administering a potentially dangerous drug for no therapeutic reason, so the doctor gave him a placebo."
2020-05-19 12:54:40,"“I take it because I think I hear very good things,” Mr. Trump said,

Well it appears as though the voices in Trump's head have become to numerous to track."
2020-05-19 13:02:50,"Frankly, I guessed that he was not telling the truth about this for some reason.  This morning I read the daily blog of American History Professor Heather Cox Richardson of Boston College.  She guesses the same but poses reasonable reasons:  “It is hard to imagine any doctor would have prescribed a drug whose side effects include heart attack to an older, overweight, president. It seems more likely that he is not actually taking such a drug, but said so because he was looking either to boost the drug again or to grab headlines away from the story about the Saudi arms sales. If so, it worked well; media outlets have prioritized his statement about taking the drug over the story of the Saudi arms sales and their connection to the firing of the State Department’s inspector general. The story has also taken attention from the fact that more than 90,000 American have now died from Covid-19.”"
2020-05-19 13:02:58,"I'm willing to bet he is not REALLY taking it.  

Instead, I figure he probably owns stock in a company that manufactures it.   Therefor, he can tout its virtues as a coronavirus cure, show how ""safe"" it is, and convince his base they need to get it to keep themselves healthy and safe.  In turn, his stock value goes up, and once again he can abuse his power of the office for personal gain.   Enriching himself, and getting himself re-elected is what matters.  Not curing COVID-19.

Anyone wanna bet?"
2020-05-19 12:50:03,"If you look at this logically, why would Trump be taking this drug if he has been testing negative for the virus? It's supposed use is for treatment - not prevention. 

I've been wondering, since you cannot believe a word that man says, if he or someone he knows is somehow invested monetarily in the 'huge' stockpiles of it that he keeps talking about. No one bought into his touting it before, so now he's had to 'up his game' by saying that he is taking it. With all the cons this man has used in his lifetime, it makes you wonder...."
2020-05-19 12:56:56,"It's always about the money with him. He has a stake in a French company that manufactures Hydroxychloroquine. He also has friends with interests in that particular drug. The White  House was even pushing for the distribution and deregulation of the drug to make it more readily available. I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that he never really took the stuff, himself."
2020-05-19 12:58:17,I admire DJT for not only the courage but demonstrating to the American people that this medicine is safe and will lessen one's chances of catching this virus.  He has to lead by example and maybe if a new medicine comes along that is better he will try that.  Remember HIV and the first drug that came along called AZT?  It was the only medicine that gave people hope to live.  So they took it regardless.  Then other more effective came along and today people all over are living with HIV taking new drugs evolve.
2020-05-19 12:59:10,"First, Trump has round the clock medical staff at his beck and call.  Taking a risky drug becomes less risky, if you have round the clock medical assistants. He should have emphasized that fact

Secondly, the quality of care offered by Dr. Conley may be suspect.  He says the “potential benefit” of the drug outweighs the  risks.  The risks of the drug for someone of Trump’s age and health are known: fatal arrhythmia.  What exactly is the potential benefit of the drug with regard to Covid-19?  And the fact that it is only a potential benefit, means that the President is taking a risky drug that may or may not have a benefit.

Third, If Trump is taking the risky drug as a preventative measure, wouldn’t a mask be safer and more reliable?

Fourth, If Trump is taking the risky drug because he was exposed to the virus, is there any evidence  that it prevents the infection after exposure?  

Fifth, If Trump was concerned about his exposure to the virus, how could he, in good conscience, meet with people, especially those WWII Vets without a mask?  

Trump continues to show the kind of irresponsible leadership and decision making that has led this country astray and has caused much needless death and suffering."
2020-05-19 13:08:44,I read that President Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with zinc.  The hydroxychloroquine helps cells to absorb the zinc and the zinc blocks the virus from entering the cells.  If you search for the combination you will find there are promising studies using it.
2020-05-19 12:49:23,"Why would he do this? the stuff can potentially have very serious side effects. And if he's lying, what is the benefit of doing that?!"
2020-05-19 13:06:27,I think he is getting a placebo and he doesn't know it. What doctor would risk criminal malpractice? The doctor would be blamed for prescribing the drug. He is doing this to push sales of the drug.
2020-05-19 13:05:17,"Remember, Trump's first doctor who claimed he had a clean bill of health, denied it later on.  I don't believe a single word that comes out of Trump's mouth and those, regardless of stature or title, who confirm his claims are just another in the long list of ""Trump enablers"" just repeating  what he and his supporters want to hear."
2020-05-19 13:09:08,"“After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Dr. Conley said. He also said the president “is in very good health and has remained symptom free.” It is a statement of a physician at odds with so called experts and researches. i know Mr. Trump as a president is a hard patient to manage. Doctors, in general, cannot prescribe what the patient wants. doctor must prescribe what is needed and what is medically sound. there is ethical rules and medical board regulations; to defy such paradigm is subject to disciplinary actions. where does Dr. Conley stand on that. It will be like the president is asking for pain killer drugs to be addicted and get high. many doctors had been disciplined for such over prescriptions. we need a safety net against president's misuse by force of doctors and drugs."
2020-05-19 13:17:16,"What clout or credibility does that leave the FDA as it tries to fend off the usual suspects profiting from the sale of dangerous and unproven remedies? How can it and other health agencies expect their warnings to be taken seriously when the head of the U.S. government is openly contradicting their advice?

Whether Trump is actually taking the drug or simply using his claim to encourage others to do so, his government's apparent approval of its off-label use might expose it to class action lawsuits down the road. 

Veterans in Canada are already suing government for claimed neuropsychiatric side-effects from taking the sister anti-malaria drug mefloquine."
2020-05-19 12:53:23,"I read that in past centuries, some countries had laws prohibiting someone from transacting business for several hours after they had taken medicine.  The worry was that the medicine could impair judgment.

I think the government should refuse to take Trump's orders on days in which he has taken this drug."
2020-05-19 13:07:25,"I guess the press hasn't learned that what he says and what he does are two different things. I suppose right now his calculation is that it benefits him personally somehow to say this thing, politically or financially.  That's his only motivation to do anything, actually."
2020-05-19 13:25:49,worse it can't stay.
2020-05-19 13:28:28,"What do you have to lose?  With you taking hydroxychloroquine, Mr. President? We have nothing to lose, on the contrary."
2020-05-19 13:36:07,Very high probability that Trump is flat out lying.
2020-05-19 13:24:19,"“He’s doing this to save face.” That’s what Dr. Vin Gupta said last night on MSNBC. Doesn’t mean he’s taking it, but he’s doubling down and talking to his base only. 

It’s also a byproduct of his toxic masculinity such as refusing to wear a mask because he thinks it looks weak. Everyone who is a medical professional has said this drug is dangerous - which is why he’s saying he is taking it, because it makes him look fearless in the eyes of his cult following."
2020-05-19 13:31:19,He's lying. He's not taking it. One could only wish he were and in high doses.
2020-05-19 13:42:40,"I think whatever medical organization is responsible for licensing and credentialing Trump's doctor, Sean Conley (he's in the navy and a D.O.), should consider at least censuring him for prescribing  hydroxychloroquine. I realize doctors are allowed to prescribe off label, but shouldn't they have at least some evidence, even anecdotal, that it works?   I know that some doctors believe that it may have helped improve hospitalized patients (although with no control group), absolutely no one had said that it works prophylactically."
2020-05-19 13:37:25,He’s more likely taking adderall.
2020-05-19 13:37:30,I for one am all for him taking hydroxychloroquine. He knows the possible consequences.
2020-05-19 13:41:34,"NY Times, don't fall for one of his distractions again! All this is is a distraction from all the bad news on his administration's handling of COVID 19, the congressional hearing with Dr. Bright and his appearance on 60 minutes, and the arm sales to Saudi Arabia.   
Or, it is as others have said, a sales pitch for the drug/drug company owned by a friend, his family, etc...  That is what you should be investigating.....follow the money."
2020-05-19 13:42:30,A distraction.  He’s so good at getting the media to chase their tails whenever the real scandals get press.
2020-05-19 13:07:18,"No way he’s taking this drug. It’s a lie. I don’t believe for a minute he’d risk getting arrhythmia or any other side effects by taking a drug that 1. he doesn’t need because he’s not sick in the first place; and 2. it’s a drug that is not used to prevent the coronavirus. What doctor in the WH would ethically and legally prescribe it under these non-conditions??? He’s SAYING he’s taking it to save face for touting it so much. And it plays to his base if he thumbs his nose at the medical community and specifically, Dr. Bright. 

Trump increasingly displays mental illness. This nightmare can’t get over soon enough. Unbelievable."
2020-05-19 13:44:08,"I'm not so sure that hydroxychloroquine is as bad as it is portrayed. I just checked with an MD friend in Italy and asked her if it is still used as prophylaxis against Covid-19, and she said yes. If one goes to pubmed.gov and searches covid-19 hydroxychloroquine, there are many studies detailing its usage during the pandemic. The FDA warns the public because it is its job to warn the public, and there are side effects; but the drug is well known so they can be managed by a doctor who knows how to do it."
2020-05-19 12:50:09,"Does this really matter? Does it really need to be reported, dissected and opined? Everyone knows what comes next and, frankly, I just don’t care. He says ANYTHING and the media goes wild. This is a game Trump knows how to play. He wins with the coverage and we all lose. 

No mask? So what. Stop the constant reporting. It just keeps him front and center.

Taking unproven drugs? Is anyone surprised he said it? True or not, stop dissecting it. 

Obamagate? Honestly,  why the news coverage? Trump is just going to make up something anyway to tweak Obama and the media. Reporting the comment over and over just gives it validity. Stop! You are being used.

Trump’s motivations are not difficult to determine. Why give him a bigger pulpit than he already has?"
2020-05-19 13:01:33,"Which witch doctor obtained this drug for him, assuming anyone did?  When you have a person who doesn't value his own credibility make a claim, and no independent outsider can verify it, how do we know Trump has ever even seen a milligram of this drug?

His donor, Novartis, who makes and sells this drug for profit, wants to make more money from it, especially during a pandemic marked by panic mass purchases.  Now that the opioid market is getting cut off at the knees, drug companies, whose profits have been addicted to selling drugs that hurt and kill people, will this be the next institutionally/systemically abused drug?"
2020-05-19 13:22:00,"Donald Trump said  “I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,”  “What do you have to lose?”
Which prompts the question,: Has he instructed his loved ones to take it, and if they are not heeding his advice to the nation, why not?  
Same question for Hannity and Ingram."
2020-05-19 12:46:35,"Trump *says* he's taking it.  I don't believe it for a second.  He got the scientists out of the way, so now he's bringing hyrdoxychloroquine back into the conversation.  He stands to profit from people taking this, pure and simple (assuming doctors are willing to prescribe it)."
2020-05-19 12:50:59,"Given his age, weight, and diet, I'd wager that his doctors are only giving him a placebo, just to let him think he's having his way in his superior wisdom to everyone else on the planet."
2020-05-19 12:51:01,"""I take it because I think I hear good things about it."" President Trump. 

Everyone should read and then reread that statement. He is taking a drug because he ""thinks"" he heard good things about it?  At the very least, wouldn't he want to be positive he has heard good things?"
2020-05-19 13:15:26,"Senator Susan Collins said Trump would ‘learn his lesson’ from the impeachment proceedings. Senator, is please explain the lesson he’s learned here."
2020-05-19 13:19:18,"Although he had been promoting this questionable drug for a while, to suddenly announce he’s taking it begs the question: did he test positive? He would not admit that and he certainly would not quarantine."
2020-05-19 13:25:58,Trump's narcissism has led us to him acting like a child who is doubling down on  his fabrications. His handling of the current crisis should tell us how to vote in the fall so we can return to facts and scientific data.
2020-05-19 13:19:47,A politician that actually talks the talk and walks the walk. No wonder everyone is up in arms.
2020-05-19 13:23:48,Yesterday’s news lead was Trump‘s firing of yet another IG investigating his administrations rogue activities. Today’s lead story is the (probably fake) account of Trump’s Hydroxychloroquine  use as a defense against Covid-19. Another diversionary tactic applied to effectively control the news cycle.
2020-05-19 13:20:00,"Trump is doing what he does best, controlling the 24-hour news cycle.  I doubt that he's taking the medication.  With a disastrous handling of the pandemic and a crashing economy, he needs a way to keep the bad news from bubbling-up-- distract and keep control of the narrative.  That's the Trump game.  Media seems to play along."
2020-05-19 13:21:12,"If he does not die of a heart attack soon (the recognized adverse side effect of the ""Combo"" he is taking), then that means he is lying about taking the Hydroxy in combination with a Z-Pack.

He is taking statins, indicating that he is at risk of coronary artery disease (in all probability he has it given his technical obesity).  No doctor would prescribe the Combo.

He just can't stop talking."
2020-05-19 13:23:35,"Any account beginning with the words ""trump says"" is at least 99% unlikely to be true."
2020-05-19 13:33:04,With Trump we can never be sure he is not lying. It would come as no surprise to me if we later learn he never took chloroquine. Of course in this case he may have calculated that the risks associated with taking it are easier to endure that losing an election.  Since he has nothing else to offer he follows his con man instinct of peddling fantasies and backing them up with showmanship.
2020-05-19 13:34:10,"In 2016, I was shocked at seeing all the Trump for president campaign signs on the road from Ithaca to Albany, New York. I wrote a cautionary commentary for the online journalism site at which I am a contributor. Since then, it has been one cataclysm after another both here and around the world. Hydroxychloroquine, Covid-19, and Trump are the latest aftershocks in this ongoing disaster."
2020-05-19 13:33:34,"First of all, if trump's lying, his physician has an ethical responsibility to PUBLICLY correct his patient to prevent others from following his dangerous advice.

Second, if he's truly taking it, I can only hope he ends up serving as a vivid warning (through anecdotal evidence) as to the dangers of the drug's side-effects so countless thousands of others can avoid a similar fate. Being the first useful thing he's ever done, it would give his life meaning!"
2020-05-19 13:35:19,This from the man who looked directly into the eclipse without  a protective eye shield. Surely this is not unexpected if indeed he is taking it. Who knows. . . he or his progeny might have stock in the company that produces it.
2020-05-19 13:23:14,"To me it is a distraction. I don't believe he is taking it. Besides how long will he take it? Until a vaccine is available?  By publicly announcing that he is taking it, media attention is being diverted from some critical issues that he doesn't want people or media to talk about . All media should minimize publicity to such a stunt."
2020-05-19 13:30:01,I wonder if there should be an investigation into Trump family investments. I bet there's a profit motive in here somewhere.
2020-05-19 13:30:41,"Gee, if only there were some way of knowing whether Trump has a financial stake in this or not. Maybe just maybe he ain’t entirely on the level here folks."
2020-05-19 13:35:26,"I think ""says"" is the key word in this title. Trump has said lots of things that weren't necessarily true. For example, talking about releasing his tax returns on September 27, 2016: ""I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit, and it will be released. As soon as the audit's finished, it will be released""."
2020-05-19 13:28:17,"Unless other heads of state are doing it, while others are given a placebo what kind of controlled experiment is this?"
2020-05-19 13:22:23,"I've never taken hydroxychloroquine. But chloroquine is a VERY common malaria drug and I've takes courses of it several times when in appropriate malaria area (its useless for certain areas). 

And no one ever told me it was as dangerous as its hydroxy variant is being made out to be."
2020-05-19 13:30:55,"When I was in 4th grade they told us if we hid under our desks at school we wouldn't be in danger from a nuclear attack.

They were right. I hid under the desk and I haven't been in danger from a nuclear attack."
2020-05-19 13:19:33,"Why does the press fall for the obvious distraction du jour by this liar? He knows the press and public will chatter about this instead of covering all his other failures.  He's not taking this drug - he's sequestered in the White House, getting tested everyday, and the White House physician, who misled the public about Trump's physical, has questionable credibility.  Trump has a financial interest in the drug and wouldn't care if people got hurt or killed taking it.  If he's really taking it, have him, with his physician present, actually take it in front of the public; this would not violate his medical privacy because he's announced to the nation that he's taking it."
2020-05-19 13:23:39,"Great idea and since donald is in the heat of the battle against the virus maybe he should triple up on dosage?  Make it 10x.
He's not taking it anyway so he might as well blow up the quantity too.
How would I know that, you ask?  Easy.  He says he's taking it."
2020-05-19 13:30:15,"Were his lips moving when he claimed to be taking it? If so he was simply lying, as usual."
2020-05-19 13:32:29,"So anyone else think that maybe just maybe Trump is lying? Hmmmm? He always lies and he is lying now. IF he was taking that drug he'd be on Twitter complaining about it. Here's the strategy America in case you don't know:
First they lie
Then they lie again
then they lie some more
the end"
2020-05-19 13:37:22,"In S. Philly, drug dealers get 10 years in prison when they're caught selling drugs that harm people. What kind of jail time is Trump looking at?

Doesn't this qualify as an impeachable High Crime and Misdemeanor? S. Philly would be empty of drug dealers if they admitted dealing drugs."
2020-05-19 13:44:27,Trump is believing his own lies now. It's one thing to get high on your own supply. It's another thing when you're the president and supposed to set an example. How many untold lemmings will follow their leader down this dangerous path?
2020-05-19 11:24:17,"Apart from being ineffective, this publicity puts many people in danger because they imitate this irrational behaviour. Choloquine therapy now signals right-extremist ideology. Bolsonaro shows the same absurd behaviour."

Lie number who-knows-what for the day."

Lets all hope he's not told he can't launch a nuclear strike."
2020-05-19 10:58:18,"Is he taking it because he is, in fact, infected? Just asking."
2020-05-19 11:49:57,"So Dr. Rick Bright the infectious disease expert is removed from his post after insisting on rigorous vetting of hydroxycholorquine as a treatment for coronavirus vaccine, while President Not So Bright starts taking it despite not even being infected with the virus."
2020-05-19 12:32:34,Trump has called hydroxychloroquine a “game changer.” He’s right. Trump taking the drug likely will be a “game changer” when it comes to his re-election prospects.

2020-05-19 11:28:49,"This is quite a breakthrough.  Billions of dollars could be saved every year on unnecessary so-called “research” and “clinical trials” in the development of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. 

Every week, a different pair of celebrities could square off, pitching their favorite folk remedies, quack cures and religious incantations.  The TV audience would vote, and the semifinalists get a trip to the White House and a big contract — with 50% royalties on future sales going to the Trump family, of course. 

I can’t wait for next week’s episode of “What Have You Got to Lose?!”"
2020-05-19 11:41:39,"Yeah sure, just like his taxes are under audit."
2020-05-19 11:42:27,"He lies about everything, why not this?

He must have shares in the stock."
2020-05-19 13:20:47,"I'm assuming that Trump is lying. That is his one consistent characteristic. Whether he is or is not taking hydroxychloroquine, he can point to the fact that he has not come down with COVID-19 and that medication therefore works just as he said. It's all just another con by Trump, albeit a potentially dangerous one."
2020-05-19 13:39:01,"Either Trump has Coronavirus - or he doesn't.

Either he is taking this powerful drug - or he isn't.

Either he is telling the truth - or he is lying.

I don't care: Just slap that 25th Amendment on him, or get rid of Pence also.

18,000 lies.... and more to come today."
2020-05-19 11:43:25,"Given the standards of the Trump presidency, has anyone checked large share transactions in manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine, before Trump's public endorsement of the drug, and who the buyers were?"
2020-05-19 11:53:30,"The probability that anyone would follow this ""advice"" except his rapturous followers is nil. So why not let him?"
2020-05-19 11:19:05,"This behavior reminds me of his altered Hurricane Dorian map.   
 
Now we have the Hydroxychloroquine prescription prescribed by Dr. Trump."
2020-05-19 13:15:19,"Trump lies all day, everyday.  Do I believe he is taking this drug? No.  Do I believe that he would financially profit if he can get the public to take it ? Yes.  Understand that what ever Trump says, the opposite is the truth. It is the grift, the con, the alternative facts, the chaos, the distraction, the Trump brand."
2020-05-19 13:24:54,"ISTR that Trump is a stockholder in Sanofi, one of the makers of hydroxychlofoquine.  What are the chances that he would be promoting this snake oil to enrich himself by endangering others?"
2020-05-19 13:29:08,"Correct, he is not only taking it, but he is also selling it.  We should only be so lucky if he were to share it with some of this cohorts.  This is not a political/party comment ,it is a sane reaction to another incompetent, thoughtless WH decision.  I won't publicly wish bad-will on him or those that follow his ""ways"", BUT,  I will say  - 
VOTE !!!!!!!"
2020-05-19 13:36:13,"If Trump is telling the truth, he is Exhibit A of the selfish hoarders of this drug who have created shortages, so that people with lupus who must take it, serious possible side effects and all, cannot get it. Everything the man has ever done - from dodging the draft with fake bone spurs to this - is always about him and only him. I feel sorry for his supporters who actually believe he cares one bit about them. I guarantee that in private conversations he ridicules the people who show up at his rallies as gullible chumps. Remember he proclaimed that he “loves the poorly educated.”"
2020-05-19 13:01:11,"Trump is taking a drug that may have serious, potentially fatal side effects?

Enjoy this beautiful day everyone."
2020-05-19 13:08:04,"It is Trump's protocol to promote what benefits him.  There is an obvious connection to this drug that benefits him financially or his family.  I doubt he is taking it, and would think if his physician prescribes it then he too is jeopardizing someone's health. Trump is a pathological liar, we already know that.

Perhaps Trump should have a press conference and show Americans he is taking the drug, by popping these pills for us, and meanwhile, let him drink some disinfectant so he can prove how ""genius"" and safe all of his taunts really are. Including Sean Hannity and other Fox supporters would help us too."
2020-05-19 13:33:57,"Trump lies constantly, about any topic, even when he doesn't have to.

He gives every impression of being fearful of physical harm so actually taking this drug would be out of character.

He has provided ample evidence of totally lacking in empathy and seems to have no care if his words lead to harm in others so long as it furthers his own agenda.

Ergo, saying he's taking this drug is probably just some random thought that popped into his head, fitting his profile of appearing to never back down, and likely isn't true."
2020-05-19 13:41:06,"I can't help suspecting that Mr. Trump hasn't even used this medication.  More than likely he's heavily invested in Hydroxy stock and is hoping that others will feel compelled to start using it.  If a view of them get sick and die, he'll sell off the stock.  Make American Graves Again."
2020-05-19 13:17:27,"As I'm reading this article I'm trying to figure out if Trump is telling the truth or not.  Is he taking it or is he lying?  My final conclusion?  I have no idea, but I do know that I no longer trust a word that comes out of this man's mouth."
2020-05-19 13:47:12,"My son-in-law was prescribed this drug for his systemic lupus approx. 5 years ago. 
He's 53, a bodybuilder & in great shape, except for his lupus.  He works hard at a physical job of home renovations.
He's closely monitored by his family Dr. + a lupus specialist + a cardiologist re: the side-effects of this drug because several times he's suffered the side-effects from this drug of irregular heart beat & heart pain that seemed like a heart attack while he's been taking this drug. He's been admitted to hospital 3 times due to these side-effects but because his lupus is advanced (he's had lupus over 10 years) the Dr's say he has to remain on the drug. 
As numerous doctors have said since Trump began pushing this drug for coronavirus it has NO proven benefit for fighting coronavirus. Trump's public endorsement for this drug is irresponsible & dangerous. 
His personal Dr. should also be publicly warning about the random use of this drug instead of sucking up to Trump."
2020-05-19 12:48:05,"A doctor who is caring for a person who has access to limitless testing would not make a risk/benefit calculation to recommend hydroxychloroquine to his patient. Testing would allow use of the medication only in a situation which necessitated it.

Recommending hydroxychloroquine would be defensible if the patient was infected.

I suspect Trump has become Covid (+)."

Very few reported any serious problems or fatalities solely because of the drug. But many believe they got free of corona virus. President's doctor believe positive benefit is higher than negative. So, let people take it in consultation with their doctor. But, if you watch CNN, the message we get is that anybody who takes it will suddenly die."
2020-05-19 13:45:14,"It is wildly irresponsible for Trump’s prescribing physician, whoever he/she was, to prescribe hydroxychloroquine (or any other drug) for an unapproved use - in this case, a potentially dangerous use.

Irrespective of what you think of Trump, it is even more irresponsible of him to reveal his misuse of the drug in this way.

The ethics of this misuse of a prescription drug ought to be examined. 

Reminder: We have another deadly epidemic in the US, caused by physicians who wildly prescribe opioids for unapproved uses, and authorize serial refills. Shame on Trump’s physician, and shame on him for touting this misuse of a drug."

The man has lied so often, why should this be different?"

But he won't wear a mask???

Right..."

2020-05-19 13:49:58,"So, if it turns out he was lying? Are there no repercussions for that type of behavior exhibited from his platform? Or, will he say he thought he was taking it, or some other weak excuse or blame that has always gotten him out of trouble? He’s always been let off because people treat him like the bumbling idiot who didn’t know better, but his toxicity eats away at everything he’s involved with. It’s uncanny. Either way, this isn’t sane behavior, and every day he isn’t removed our country goes deeper into chaos. His enablers, and Bannon, must be so entertained."
2020-05-19 13:52:48,"We know that Trump has to double down on every stupid thing he does or says.  Especially when he's called upon it.  Remember the sharpie hurricane map?  So I'm thinking he's (1) lying because he's doubling down to protect his ego, (2) actually stupid enough to be taking it, or (3) the adults in the room are giving him placebos and telling him it's chloroquine."
2020-05-19 13:56:42,"We should know Trump better by now.  Of course he's lying.  Watch the tape:   the argument is about the efficacy  of this potential remedy and at the point where the President is outnumbered he makes an out of the blue claim that he's taking it.  Don't you think he'd be bragging about this 2 weeks ago when he apparently began his use?   And look at his face as he makes the claim:  that empty, innocent look he makes as he spouts the most idiotic things.   We should know him better by now."
2020-05-19 12:46:49,"When Trump speaks, we know no more than when a dog growls. Is he taking the stuff? Who knows? He may be. Or he may be lying. Or he may have taken it once. Or he may not remember. Or he may think he's taking it, but isn't.

The peaks in late 2018 correspond to the midterm elections, and in late 2019 to his impeachment inquiry.

So on Monday at the end of his press conference  out pops another lie ' I have been taking it for 10 days no problems so far'. 
Trump has been lying his entire life, this is nothing new for him. What is new or newish for Americans given that he has lied over 18 thousand times according to the Post since his  swearing in.

He does not use a mask or gloves, and social distancing is out at his news conferences, but he is taking a drug that he and only he considers to be a “game changer.” For what game? There is something not right about this man. His decisions and opinions are consistently wrong, he appears to be playing his role as President as though he’s doing reality tv, and he has not accomplished anything positive for the US since he took office. Unless you consider the death of 90,000 Americans, the animosity of our allies and other world leaders, the division of the American people along racially and financially, the mistreatment of refugees, his profiteering from his hotel business while in office, his fear and refusal to allow scrutiny of his tax and education records, his stacking of the Supreme Court to do his bidding as good for the nation.

Hydroxychloroquine-COVID-19 study did not meet publishing society’s “expected standard”
Didier Raoult

The paper that appears to have triggered the Trump administration’s obsession with hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for infection with the novel coronavirus has received a statement of concern from the society that publishes the journal in which the work appeared.

The April 3, 2020, notice, from the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, states that the March 20 article, “Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of Covid-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial” does not meet the [International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy’s] expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.

2020-05-19 13:46:56,How do we know he is telling the TRUTH?  Is he really taking it?
2020-05-19 13:51:22,If he wants to take it let him. Perhaps double the dose if he is so sure it is safe and effective as a treatment for this virus.
2020-05-19 13:53:39,Trump m must have invested pretty heavily in this miracle drug. Maybe he will also be able to display any icky side effects.
2020-05-19 13:58:28,"Ok fine, he believes in the miracle power of hydroxychloroquine and believes testing is unreliable and overrated.Then he should not get tested every day like they are doing now, nor should anybody around him. Some one else may benefit from those tests."
2020-05-19 14:04:28,Is it wise to take an immunosuppressant during a pandemic? We will soon find out!

2020-05-19 13:39:19,"It's astonishing that he already has a casual name for the drug: ""hydroxy"". Almost like doctors talk casually with each other. Or is hydroxychloroquine just too many syllables? And he says ""there is a very good chance that this has an impact, especially early on"". That statement is not based on scientific evidence, only imaginary anecdote, and I'm not so sure Trump even knows what the word ""prophylaxis"" means, in any sphere. I'd not wager on it.
And is he honest about taking this drug that may harm him? He does know that millions of Americans are in his thrall and will follow his example. It's one way of doing a large scale drug trial without all those pesky regulations. Perhaps checking what drug equities he and his are into (or stuck in) could shed some light. That check COULD be done, if Congress was sufficiently motivated to stop him from harming people.
After such PPE and equipment scarcity,  large stores of ""hydroxy"" are available. It's like a miracle!"
2020-05-19 13:42:39,"Whether true or not, making this statement demonstrates that Trump is unfit to be President."

Besides, his health has been failing for months now as he tries to keep his head above water. Human testing is necessary for us to get out of this pandemic. Trump is a good choice."
2020-05-19 13:57:14,"As much as I enjoy watching Trump look like a fool. As a practicing physician, I am bound to tell the truth. There is a bit of hyperbole in the uproar over Trump taking an approved drug for unapproved reasons. As a board certified physician,  I do have the authority to use drugs for unlabeled indication but am still subject to malpractice charges if there are adverse effects  or death. There are many patients taking  hydroxychloroquine(plaquenil) daily without cardiac complications for indicated treatments like arthritis. I urge those patients not to stop their medications but ask your doctor for regular electrocardiograms which most patients probably have not been getting. Alas, in spite of his ignorance Trump is unlikely to suffer complications unless the  WH doctor is not monitoring his electrocardiograms or divine intervention. 
Trump never misses the opportunity to look out for himself and he could care less about the thousands who will die because of his incompetence. The only reasonable response is to vote him out in November."
2020-05-19 13:58:01,"Number one, I don't believe he's taking it. Number two, I do believe that he must have some financial stake in this drug. Number three, I just want to point out that on Fox News, this is a drug that was fully promoted for a disease that they said was a hoax and that they now say is a dangerous drug (again, for a hoax).

This is our world."
2020-05-19 13:59:46,"If after all the lies he's been caught in you find this outrageous,  either you haven't been paying attention for years or you are just looking for ways to wind yourself up.  If you think he should be held accountable for this infomercial, distraction, or delusion you are still wasting your energy and setting your emotions on fire while the GOP still breathes life in Congress.  Really, he was impeached and the only defense by the GOP in the Senate was everyone is lying.  Not a shred of actual defense was offered up nor was the testimony or evidence actually challenged.  He has yet to be held accountable for any actions so until there is an actual change in the balance of power in Washington, you can't change anything until you vote in November to change it.  Although donating time or money to a proper candidate will help and re-capturing the House was a great start.

I, for one, will not watch any broadcast of him as just reading the headlines about it is enough for me.  And I don't even have to click on FOX just to see what propaganda they are issuing.  Any credibility they had died off decades ago.

I don't expect this comment will change anyone's mind.  I think it's just a way to vent.

Thank you

So if our ""president"" says something, ignore it .  If the White House or one of his appointees issues a statement wait 48 hours to see if they are fired.  If not, ignore that too."
2020-05-19 13:43:53,I'm not sure why he's taking it if he's not symptomatic -so it really proves nothing. It's simply an ad for a drug he and his donors will make money from. I guess he doesn't have Lupus or Rheumatoid arthritis either so it must work! At least that seems to be the thought process - he won't get malaria either so thats a relief.
2020-05-19 14:03:45,"And the war on science by the radical right continues. Ignore the doctors, ignore the experts. See I took it and I didn't get sick. The doctors should do as I say.

If he's so sure, maybe he should forgo his daily testing and let someone else get a free test - someone important who needs it."

Hawking dubious (and potentially dangerous) cures and, just days ago, saying that he was looking for another ""outlet"" because Fox was not the same anymore. He seems to be in a pupal stage, slowing morphing into a hybrid of Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Oz. Of course he wants to win re-election, but if he loses, the Trump News Network will go live before Biden's inauguration.

2020-05-19 13:51:24,"The following is a list of side effect of Hydroxychloroquine I came across on the Al Jazeera website, from an article by a British physician:

""Mild side effects from the drug include headaches, dizziness, loose stools and stomach cramps.

However, there are far more serious side effects.

These can include permanent eye damage leading to blindness; possibly fatal effects on your heart rhythm; hearing loss, low blood sugar, and permanent hair loss; and changes in mood, including depression...""  All this plus kidney and liver damage and fatal heart arrhythmias.

Let's see...hearing loss, permanent hair loss, changes in mood including depression...

How long did Trump say he's been using hydroxychloroquine?  Instead of a week and a half, it would appear ten and a half years is closer to the truth.

And there lies the rub.  ""Truth"" and ""Trump"" share most of their letters in common, but like the same poles of a pair of magnets, they just will not connect."
2020-05-19 13:58:08,"Remember that the dosage makes it toxic, and he never said how much he is taking.

Everyone has zinc in their bodies but without the HCQ it does not get inside the cell where Covid-19 is replicating.  So, if DJT has been exposed, it is wise to take this combination early to prevent viral replication.  Hopefully he will not get sick.   If he does it will his HCQ+Zinc combo will hopefully improve his chances of making a complete and speedy recovery.

Conley certainly does not help the reputation of DOs in the medical field by doing what he has done.  While I have personally known and worked with DOs that are superb providers, the medical field does not in general perceive them in that manner, especially those who do not do post graduate training ( residency amd fellowship) in ACGME accredited programs.  

In the medical field, DOs are frequently viewed as “second class” because the DO pathway is usually the pathway taken by those who were unable to get into medical school. As mentioned above, this is a sensitive issue, as many DOs do Go onto acgme accredited programs and are outstanding providers.  Some；however, do not and are trained in osteopathic post grad programs, which are usually in non academic settings."

He may be taking z-pack too. I don't know. The studies cited here on hydroxychloroquine, I believe, only used the single drug, not a cocktail of drugs and supplements. By itself, the studies concluded the drug is not effective. I've yet to read a study on the drug combined with zinc.   I think they are doing studies on the combination but none have been completed with conclusions as yet. That said, it appears the medical concern is the side effects given Trump's heart risks. Also, taking an unproven combination of drugs is a concern."

Conley, that the President is in “very good health.” What the American people here are being told to ignore is what they see with their own eyes. That the President is significantly overweight, on the way to morbid obesity. Which leaves one question to ask in the midst of all this insanity.

After wasting time trying to figure it out, including whether it was just another lie, I realized Trump succeeded again in guiding the news cycle to the only thing on earth that matters to him, himself.

What's truly scary is that Trump will make up anything to counter proven facts being told by experts like Dr. Rick Bright or Dr. Fauci.  His mantra of having ""total authority"" continues down a very dangerous path when it comes to possibly directly impacting other peoples' lives.

While most will know that his words are false, there are still a large number of people who not only believe this man, but will follow in his footsteps because of quotes such as “All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK"" and “I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy"".

But what's worse is that the entire Republican Party and almost half of Americans now believe that all of this is morally acceptable.

Could we please have some cardiologists answer. Or any actual doctor would be fine. Trump is a patent medicine, snake oil salesman out of the 19th century, peddling his miracle cures to make a buck and score a con.

Is is most certainly lying and not taking the drug. He lies reflexively. Besides clearly being sociopathic (lacking any sense of empathy) and narcissistic (delusions of centrality and grander) he is a pathological liar and seems unable to control lying at ever opportunity. 

Like all of his character flaws, it happens in the open, so somehow Trump thinks -- like shooting someone on 5th ave. or robbing people in broad daylight -- this means it isn't a crime. 

It is. 

So are the tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths of Americans. It is a crime that it seems we will only be able to punish through voting all Republicans out of office in Nov. 

If we are allowed a fair election. There will be rampant voter suppression, misinformation, Russian interference, and electronic voting machine tampering. So we need to make it a landslide that can offset all of these factors.

With rising anxiety and fear about his declining poll numbers in handling this crisis, he resorts to reckless behaviors of suggesting disinfectants to combat the contagion and touting hydroxychloroquine for treatment. He sent out 124 tweets in 48 hours during Mother's day weekend to level off with his critics. Now, he claims he is taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent infection after exposure to covid-19 without scientific evident. The erratic, unstable, delusional, and deranged mind are in full display.

2020-05-19 15:07:40,"My hunch is Trump is lying--what are the odds?  He is not really taking the drug but bragging about doing a totally irresponsible thing.  

Why would any president put himself (at age 73) and gullible people at risk by advocating taking a drug shown to have little benefit but found to have serious even lethal side effects?

A.  Money: Trump, his family, and/or cronies have stock in the company making the drug.  

B.  Publicity stunt: An old Karl Rove piece of advice was for the president to control the news cycle and change the topic of the national conversation about every 3 days.  

This way the citizens stay focused on the president (pro and con) to create a buzz and divide the country for GOP gain.  Don't say this doesn't work--the GOP has turned media domination into an art form.  Where are the Democrats?

Also, the president controls the media by choosing the topics to feature.  Wh? To keep a favorite issue in the pubic eye repeatedly.  To divert attention from mistakes & criticisms.  And to keep off the table anything the president and his party don't want discussed (e.g., rising inequality, disastrous public health performance, drinking disinfectant, flagrant corruption and cronyism....).

Study Trump.  There really is method to his madness. But for Lord's sake, don't vote for him!!"
2020-05-19 15:01:40,"Why should we believe a word Trump says?  Somehow, I’ll bet dollars to donuts, this claim is about enriching him and his family or donors."
2020-05-19 15:05:20,"Although Dr. Conley is probably not the first physician to have been asked or bullied by a patient into prescribing a drug the patient does not need, that does not excuse him from irresponsibly allowing the president of the United States to take a drug that could kill him. 

I am about as far from a fan of this president as it is possible to get, but the fact remains that it is Dr. Conley’s  job to safeguard his health. What’s next? Snake oil? Opioids on demand? 

What I wish is that the good doctor could give Donnie some smart pills."

2020-05-19 14:53:25,Who really knows if he is or isn't actually taking it? We can't count on a single word of truth. Pointless to even discuss it.
2020-05-19 15:11:24,"If a person or patient is delusional, has ideation to inflict pain or harm others, detachment to reality to function normally in a society, it is the moral and clinical judgement of his/her physician to refer the patient for psychiatric evaluation. 

Trump's chronic pathological lying, narcissistic and sociopathic behaviors are well known now that become norms to him.  He continues to engage in criminal negligent causing needless human sufferings and deaths in the midst of a pandemic.

With rising anxiety and fear about his declining poll numbers in handling this crisis, he resorts to reckless behaviors of suggesting disinfectants to combat the contagion and touting hydroxychloroquine for treatment. He sent out 124 tweets in 48 hours during Mother's day weekend to level off with his critics. Now, he claims he is taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent infection after exposure to covid-19 without scientific evident. The erratic, unstable, delusional, and deranged mind are in full display.

GOP did not remove the president during the Impeachment and would not invoke 25th Amendment for unfit to serve for political expedient. It is the moral, ethical duty and clinical judgement of White House physician to commit the president for a through psychiatric evaluation. It is no laughing matter any more."
2020-05-19 14:47:17,"When we see his tax returns, we'll know the truth of his salesmanship."
2020-05-19 14:51:11,"Mr. Trump’s announcement leads us to the following questions:

* Was the hydroxychloroquine prescribed by one of the White House doctors? If no, then who gave Mr. Trump the prescription?

* Is Mr. Trump lying again?  He really is not taking hydroxychloroquine but he knows that his comment will distract from IG firings, COVID death totals, etc. 

* Did Mr. Trump test positive for the COVID-19 virus?  Then he was supposed to keep it a secret but once again his ego got the best of him. 

Bottom line - Mr. Trump is not the leader that this country wants for another four years.  Donate, volunteer and vote in November."
2020-05-19 14:59:02,"Is he running scared? No sooner does he learn that two people in his inner circle are infected he starts taking a drug with major side effects, a drug intended for other conditions,  to insulate himself from the virus. Oh yes, his doctor gave the okay. I suspect that if his doctor did not he would not be his doctor for long and that he would seek out another doctor  that would agree with him."
2020-05-19 14:59:33,"I am sure I read in the recent past that trump had acquired millions of dosages of this drug.  With that in mind, now that it has been proven not to be his miracle cure,  he is left holding the bag of goodies and needs to unload.  What better way to market his inventory but claim to be taking it.  Always the snake oil salesman."
2020-05-19 15:04:26,"Of course Trump is not taking hydroxychloroquine!

I guarantee Trump's doctor will never say Trump is taking the drug. Just look at the letter that came out yesterday. It says they spoke about the medication. Nowhere does it say Trump is taking it.  I feel sorry for his doctor in a way. He's going to have to hide out to avoid having to lie about this."
2020-05-19 15:09:38,"How to be irresponsible when you occupy the most senior position of government and set a bad example for those that don't know the difference. I am an MD . The use of almost every medication has risks and benefit. Trump has disregarded medical opinion and the literature and decided to take Plaquenil...ie Hydoxychloroquine. While that is his personal choice, he also sets a bad example for people that would follow his lead and are not as well monitored, and frankly dont understand the risks vs benefits of the drug.  He shamelessly promotes an unproven treatment with significant side effects. He may be President, and there may be questions about how well he performs his elected office, but, he certainly is not a scientist or physician. A dangerous man in a very significant position of authority and influence doing what he does best,  making a lot of noise and dangerous recommendations . At least we already know whatever the outcome, he will not take responsibility , since he seems to believe he is always right and never responsible if he is proven wrong."

Since Trump lies about EVERYTHING personal and impersonal (his height is closer to 6'1"", not 6'3"", his weight closer to 270, not 243, etc.), chances are high that he's lying about taking this drug, as well as shilling for public adjudication of his earlier lies about the drug's risks."
2020-05-19 15:13:36,"Consider the possibility (probability?) that he's lying. But if he is really taking it, let's hope he man's up and takes at least a double dose. After all he is the greatest, biggest, bravest of all.
He would need at least double."
2020-05-19 14:48:01,"Trump makes decisions not so much on facts, but on what is ""in his gut"". As a retired counselor and child protective social worker, I am very experienced in working with people whose lifestyles are rooted in doing things ""by the gut"".  Instead of thinking before acting, such people simply follow their internal triggers and act, often without much obvious thought.  Are we to believe that Trump has some kind of superpower intuition that allows him to make decions affecting all of us, without benefit of serious thought from a variety of expert resources?  I don't buy it.  His thoughtless decisions are no better than any common criminal running the streets."
2020-05-19 15:03:35,It is my understanding is that the VA continues  to administer hydrooxychloroqyine to veterans with the virus. The results have been limited at best and veterans hospitalized in VA facilities continue to die at an alarming rate...seems the trump administration is using veterans to prove his case and for re-election purposes.
2020-05-19 14:50:14,"After pushing the drug and, as a consequence investments in it, he has to continue promoting it. I personally doubt he is taking it. By saying he is taking it, he accomplishes two thing important to him: he publicly defies science; he gets many of his followers to buy it and boost sales as they seek prescriptions."
2020-05-19 15:01:14,"Dear mr. President! 

Just eat and take as much as possible of this magic medicin. It will make you stronger and an even more stable genius!

And it is very good for your hair.

I will send flowers!"
2020-05-19 15:03:39,"Like several others on this thread, I am an MD.

President Trump is not like your typical ""patient."" He is monitored almost constantly.

Hydroychloroquine can cause your heart to lose the ability to beat correctly. That can easily be fatal. FATAL.

If indeed Mr. Trump and his physician have weighed the ""evidence"" (it's certainly not evidence I have seen) and concluded the potential benefits of taking it outweigh the risks for (apparently) preventing coronavirus (prophylaxis), I can't imagine he isn't on some device constantly doing an EKG (or at least several times a day), which none of us can easily have available except in a hospital (the only type of facility the FDA considers to considers acceptable to study the drug).

Please do not just take this medication on your own. There is no evidence it works and the EMTs in your locality won't be able to respond as quickly as those already present at the White House."
2020-05-19 15:07:59,"Let's start with the premise that the President should not be touting any drug or treatment.  I get it.  However, today on CBS This Morning Dr David Agus, in response to a question about whether the President should be taking the medication, stated that the taking of any medication is a personal decision taken with the advice of the patient's physician, and that notwithstanding the FDA's statement, once the FDA authorizes the use of a drug it can be used for other purposes (""off-label"" treatments - ask anyone with thinning hair how Minoxidil went from a blood pressure medication to hair restoration).   Dr. Agus also noted that there are still studies being conducted on the effects of this drug. 
We can all be armchair physicians and criticize someone's use of a drug, but at the end of the day it is the individual's personal choice."
2020-05-19 15:13:31,"The assumption that Donald Trump is actually doing what he he said he is doing requires coroboration. 
   And if it is so, then the next question is that if he believes that it helpful and benign, and that there is ""nothing to lose,"" then has he reccommended Hydroxychloroquine for his own family and the Vice President;  And if they are not heeding his advice, why not?"

2020-05-19 15:06:31,"What will this president call for next as response to the coronavirus?  Mega-vitamins and herbs?  
Not only does this fool refuse to repair his breathtaking scientific ignorance, he sets a dangerous example for those dumb enough to listen to him in taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc as “preventatives.” 
South Korea had its first reported case of the coronavirus the same day as the United States, as is widely known.  Testing, contact tracing, stay at home measures have been highly effective there.  Here we have a president who refuses to wear a mask in a mask factory, blames the WHO, China, Democrats, and the media for his failures.   I never thought we could see such an abomination in the White House, a vacuum of leadership."

Hydroxychloroquine Side Effects: ""headache with chest pain and severe dizziness, fainting, fast or pounding heartbeats;
very slow heart rate, weak pulse;
muscle weakness, numbness or tingling;
low blood sugar--headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious..."" Also swallowing this continuously unnecessarily without any malaria symptom for a long time might cause serious health issues."

Also, I would like to read what actually happens to a person taking this drug, that is, what immediate effects it has.  I've seen a couple anecdotes from people who have taken it for malaria or lupus who say it's painful or uncomfortable immediately.  Could someone please report on that?"

I thought that was what those free Treasury loans were for, but he wants a gift of free payroll for his workers BUT he ALSO wants to reduce their share from 75% of said gift so more of the money can go into his bottom line.

But when he carries this despicable strategy of his farther, and, to deflect from his own failures, focuses on WHO, then we have a real issue.  But, of course, he has been doing this kind of strategic lying all his life, so what could you expect?"
2020-05-19 15:38:45,"He says he's taking it, but is he really?"
2020-05-19 15:59:16,I'm assuming he (or his big donors ) have invested in this drug and that he is lying about taking it himself.
2020-05-19 16:08:53,"A medication that has toxic effects--even heart attacks--and Trump appears fine. Hmmmm. Given the 18,000 lies to date, it seems this is 18,001."
2020-05-19 15:50:51,"I hope he's getting his eyes checked regularly;  I've been taking a small dose of  hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis for several years.  I have to get a thorough eye exam every year because of the possible side effects of the drug. 

 Too bad it can't cure ignorance or sociopathy."
2020-05-19 16:07:15,Trump could be lying about taking hydroxychloroquine — he lies about everything else. Lying is his whole political strategy. I suppose Dr. Conley's statement mitigates that possibility. But it is still possible.
2020-05-19 15:41:12,Trump's lying as usual.  There's no way he's actually taking it.
2020-05-19 15:49:16,"Of course, Trump, is not taking the drug. He can lie through his teeth, and who is going to prove him wrong? My thoughts are that he is going to tell people that the drug works and that he is a god who survived the crisis. He is not a risk taker if it involves his health, although he is probably a doctor's nightmare in terms of  having good health."
2020-05-19 16:12:27,"Trump praised the drug and disregarded the medical experts who disagreed with him. It placed him in a situation where he needed to admit that he was mistaken or prove to his audience that he was right, somehow. This is his solution, risk a heart problem in the hope that nothing bad will happen and he can claim that he was right. A rather adolescent kind of defiance rather than a mature consideration of the consequences of his behaviors for which he accepts responsibility."
2020-05-19 16:22:25,"""I don't believe him"". That was my immediate first thought when I saw Trump claim he was taking hydroxychloroquine.  The only person in the world Trump really cares about is himself. He has heard for weeks about the possible, sometimes really serious negative consequences of taking the drug for conditions other than for what it was designed. Taking it for no condition at all cannot be thought to have no possible adverse consequences. It is not to be believed any  doctor would suggest Trump take  hydroxychloroquine, to prove, what? Does that not sound like medical malpractice to even suggest doing so? And who would provide the drug for such a purpose?  From the  moment he came down the escalator to announce his campaign for President, has Trump not lied about anything and everything he wanted to? (A  ""lie"" is a statement known to be false made with the intent to deceive). This  Trump hydroxychloroquine lie reveals to everyone the abject indifference and disregard  Trump has for  the lives of every human being not named Donald Trump."
2020-05-19 15:45:57,"Republicans in Congress could stop this, but they've decided to hitch their political fortunes to conspiracy theories and misinformation. Americans are dying as a result. Who will be held to account?"
2020-05-19 16:12:51,"If he really is taking it and his doctor didn’t prescribe it, wouldn’t that technically be drug abuse?"
2020-05-19 15:44:08,I understand one of the potential side effects of hydroxychloroquine is hair loss.  We'll be watching intently.
2020-05-19 15:56:54,"Why do we believe he is taking the medicine? With 15,000 lies and counting, it's probably just another planned distraction from serious crimes.

And if he is taking the medicine: if a little is good, more is better. Solves two problems at once."
2020-05-19 16:09:47,"At this point can we believe ANYTHING he says.  And, frankly I care as much about his well being as he does about anybody else's."
2020-05-19 16:12:19,"Remember Trump's doctor said ""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" I bet he prescribed it :)."
2020-05-19 16:19:07,"Much as I dislike this President and his methods of public communication, let's view this as folks concerned with combatting corona virus first and the President second. 

Chloroquine is a Zn ionophore. If you take the two together, not sure of dosage, but maybe low enough to not cause as many side effects, then there will be more Zn in intracellular compartments that will prevent lysosomes from functioning. The latter will prevent viruses from replicating. I have always wondered why research is not studying the effects of muffling agents safer than chloroquine, such that they can effectively concentrate Zn in lysosomes, without interfering in the ideal buffering environments needed by our bodies."
2020-05-19 16:20:33,"Maybe people realize it but then maybe they don't completely understand.  Trump is surrounded by a medical staff.  As I recall, some medical professionals have stated that if you use Hydroxychloroquine for treatment, it must be under close medical supervision which is not available to most all citizens.  What he is condoning or suggesting to the general public is criminal in my opinion."
2020-05-19 16:24:16,"Bad choices for himself is way better than allowing him to choose for others.  Those who take medical tips from Trump get to make their own bad choices, too."
2020-05-19 16:00:26,"I find it  strange that  Trump would  reveal this information  only hours after Rick Bright appeared on 60 Minutes and announced  the dangerous potential side affects of hydroxchlorquine  if used as treatment for c-19. 
Sane people know that Trump is not taking it. Chances are that he has invested in it ,and had say something to compensate for Bright and other medical professionals who all confirm that Dr. Trumps is  prescribing  a drug  that has caused more deaths than other drugs prescribed for C-19."
2020-05-19 16:12:59,He missed his true calling. He would have a made a terrific (sic) carnival barker selling snake oil remedies.

His bragging about taking a potentially dangerous drug? 
Worst president of the modern era.
Ask your doctor if this administration is for you."
2020-05-19 16:00:33,Why should I believe anything this guy says? These last four years have been full of lies. Hard to believe there could be four more years coming.
2020-05-19 15:26:06,"Oh come on America!  We are being way too hard on our heroic president, who is willing to sacrifice his health for the good of the country.

We can expect that he will present himself with the Medal of Freedom soon in the Oval Office.

The inscription will no doubt read:  ""To Donald J. Trump, the Lion Heart, who braved the unknown by ingesting Hydroxychloroquine, and seemed ok afterward.""

Our fearless leader."
2020-05-19 15:56:53,"As Trump is a self-made man who worships his creator, it just makes sense that he'd follow his own medical advice. It's appreciated that he's at the front the line in the fight against Covid-19. It's great to have Trump stand by his own advice and show the troops that he's willing to take the medication himself. We truly appreciate that!

2020-05-19 14:59:57,"The best comment of all was by Nancy Pelosi:

""As far as the president is concerned, he's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group -- what is it, morbidly obese they say. So I don't think that's a good idea,"""
2020-05-19 15:43:57,"Seriously does anyone actually believe he really taking the drug? He has a financial interest in this drug you can count on it. He's abusing the office of the presidency to broadcast infomercials on whatever product he's got a personal stake in. 

This malignant narcissist will in no way endanger or even risk his own life and he's enough of a sociopath to not care if it kills anyone else. He's such an obvious con that I'm laughing at the people trying to caution him about the personal risks thinking he's really going to use himself as a guinea pig. 

We're taking about a guy who has yet to submit a legitimate health and fitness report to the American people."
2020-05-19 15:51:12,"trump is ""reckless"", and until the corona virus, he has been wilely enough to get away unscathed in life by his irresponsible behavior. But the pandemic has leveled the field and his methods are exposed for what they are. Those who were duped by him should now realize that having a prosperous country requires hard work, not flippant disregard for what others have sacrificed to build,  strengthen and maintain."
2020-05-19 15:54:27,"Perhaps president Trump is lying about taking hydroxychloroquine just to call attention to himself.
Or, perhaps he is taking an extremely minuscule dose like...1mg per week rather than the 400mg per week dosage...in order for him and his doctors to somewhat truthfully say that he's taking the drug.
Also...some of the negative side effects of hydroxychloroquine are blurred vision, trouble focusing, distorted vision, blind spots, and trouble reading.  From another perspective he has been having these negative side effects for some time."
2020-05-19 16:22:21,"I was prescribed this medication many years ago for Chronic Lyme Disease.  I had to go to a cornea specialist while I was on it because it can cause severe damage to your eyes!  It did not help with the Lyme Disease so my doctor discontinued it but I had to continue checking in with the eye doctor to make sure there were no lasting consequences.  It is a powerful drug with dangerous side-effects.

Trump is either lying to save face for touting this drug or he is actually taking it at great danger to himself.  In addition to being the worst President In our history, he is a complete fool.  What snake oil salesman takes the snake oil himself?"
2020-05-19 15:26:36,"He is either lying, being given a placebo (or as someone suggested, Skittles), or just trying to market this dangerous drug which is not approved for Covid-19 prevention. 

So why is he pushing this? To demonstrate to the world what a He-Man he is: he doesn't need a mask, he's been exposed by his own valet, so he just pops a little pill, and voilà! he's untouchable.

Weird though that he might lead his low-information followers to their early deaths. Not a great reelection strategy is it?"

2020-05-19 15:44:13,"Is he lying?  The usual answer to that question is YES.  Does he have an ulterior motive?  YES.  Let's build up the fight between the cowards (those of us who don't want to kill people, or at least not put them on the front line of dying) versus the ""it's all a hoax!  I want a pedicure!"" folks.  (guess where MY vote goes)."
2020-05-19 16:06:21,I don't believe him. How can you tell if Trump is lying? Answer: his lips are moving.
2020-05-19 16:20:14,Do you really believe it? He's not taking it. You could clearly see that he was lying. Why? I can only guess. But so you do.
2020-05-19 15:23:16,"So he's taking an anti-malarial drug to prevent getting a Democratic hoax.  Huh? 

Or is he afraid of getting the ""Chinese virus""? And taking hydroxychloroquine shows how he is getting tough with China.

So here is our war president who calls his troops to face the virus defenseless as they work packed in, in meat packing plants. But for himself, everyone around him has to have a daily corona virus test. But why not; this is President Bone Spurs fighting the war in the protected environs of the White House.

And yet he isn't bothered by the test used in the White House calling it wrong 48% of the time, which is about the same as tossing a coin. Such a genius we have leading the war against this rather smart virus."
2020-05-19 15:24:13,"This guy lies. Perhaps he is taking the drug, perhaps not. Who can trust him any more?

This man is unstable and a clear and present danger to the American public and the world. His removal from office is more than justified. Why do we have measures in place to legally remove a mentally ill, unstable president, and not do so? This is far from politics as usual, this is acceptance of a bona fide insane President leading our country."
2020-05-19 16:26:41,"Trump touting Hydroxy again is just his attempt to distract from the fact that he has fired his fourth Inspector General this year, because his activities, and those of his minions, will not bear legal scrutiny.

2020-05-19 16:05:56,"Wait...does anyone really believe what Trump says? I'm surprised this comment even made the news. He hasn't taken hydroxycloroquine, collusion with Russia happened, and tax audits don't prevent disclosure."
2020-05-19 16:10:26,"If there is one thing that defines this administration it's irresponsibility. Whether or not this mentally ill man is actually taking the drug, it's dangerously irresponsible to talk about it as he has from his position. I believe he's lying, of course, or at the very least, his doctors have probably prescribed a placebo to placate him. I also suspect that he or his little Trumps must have a stake in the manufacture of the drug. It's hard to imagine any other explanation."

He is the President and since he is and knows more than the doctors (and generals, scientists, economists, educators, lawyers, democrats and everyone else who ticks him off at the moment), he can do whatever he wants and it's always the best and the right and the perfect thing to do, in a really biggly way.  Just ask him? He will lie, but hey, we all know that's the Trump normal. 

And we are distracted from reality which is his purpose, his Standard Operating Procedure. 

What reality? Most all of them, but for starters:

2020-05-19 16:05:25,From the same guy who touted bleach as a safe an effective measure to combat Covid-19. Next up in the Rose Garden Trump will drink battery acid from a car battery while saying its a promising treatment for Covid-19.
2020-05-19 15:40:24,"Several years ago, during the Obama administration, Trump said that his investigators in Hawaii had uncovered significant evidence to show that Barack Obama had not been born in the United States.  Remember that? The media broadcast the  false claim far and wide.  Trump never produced any evidence.  The media never followed up on the bogus claim. 

Trump has played the same game many times and the media always takes the bait. Usually he does it to distract but often just to bring attention back to himself.  I don't think he is taking hydroxychloroquine.  Media should ask for proof,  like a copy of the prescription."
2020-05-19 15:41:58,"Is Trump really taking hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)? As someone narcissistic and selfish, he must love his own life above other people’s, unless there’s an explanation behind it – he has been misguided; or he’s being paid for promoting the drug. 
HCQ is not as benign as aspirin. Would he ever try such a strong medicine, which is used for patients with malaria, arthritis or lupus, if he doesn’t suffer from any of these diseases? 
The list of side effects caused by HCQ is long, and a lot of them could prove harmful to someone like Trump. People who follow his example, might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive other patients with of their much-needed medication. Most of all it would boost the sale of HCQ."

2020-05-19 15:47:16,"It was interesting Trump didn’t name the doctor. He just said ‘yeah the WH doctor.” 

Trump is generally either lying or projecting. The Washington Post should maybe start tracking truths. 

If he’s taking it, it’s probably at a negligible dose just so he can say he’s taking it. His motivation is the same as it always is: winning. He wants to promote the drug to benefit his donors who are investors in the company. 

The NEJM published a recent observational study done at NY Presbyterian hospital that ended up neither neither supporting nor recommending against the drug. Obviously it’s just one study and I didn’t see adverse events listed. The drug night likely be a non-issue if trump had not almost literally rammed it down our throats. I have a feeling doctors are throwing anything with any plausibility at the disease. Off-label prescribing it how we got Viagra, after all.

If I mis-interpreted the data, I welcome  correction or refinement."

It creates suspense.

2020-05-19 16:15:52,"I think he is taking it. He is already a sanitizer junkie and already testing the WH staff obsessively and the virus got in anyway. As a germaphobe he must be terrified. He is mostly a bully and so, by definition, a coward. Like all bullies he attacks what he lacks and fears others see. He attacks how others look, their competence, calls them criminal, etc. But he can't bully a virus. Didn't go away magically or go down to zero cases. Desperate for something he fixated on these anecdotes about the drug and lacks critical thinking skills to parse the risks. All that time at the podium pushing the drug was him trying to talk himself into taking it and when he finally decided to do it, he didn't need to talk obsessively about it anymore.  For others,  please don't become armchair pharmacologists. There are questions about timing, doses, duration related to THIS disease that need to be answered before hundreds of thousands ?millions of people get dosed. If you must try it, there are trials going on right now you can join."

2020-05-19 16:35:10,"“After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Dr. Conley said. He also said the president “is in very good health and has remained symptom free.”

I'm sorry, but who would be gullible enough to trust Trump and a ""doctor"" associated with the White House?

Oh, yeah.  The very same voters Trump needs to win reelection."
2020-05-19 16:33:31,"It appears that Trump has a knack for finding doctors who are willing to violate medical best practices and standards of professionalism to satisfy Trump's need for affirmation.  Whether it means signing a note dictated by the patient, describing Donald's health in laughable superlatives, or agreeing to prescribe for him medication that is neither medically indicated nor appropriate.  A health care provider who can't say no to a patient should transfer that patient's care to someone more responsible.  I encounter this kind of problem frequently, as some of my psychiatric patients believe they ""need"" various treatments--pharmacologic and otherwise--and go to great lengths to try to obtain them from me.  But it's my job to resist unsound demands.  If a disgruntled patient leaves my office angry, I can take it.  Most of us still aim to do no harm."

If you don't want people risking their health with an untested drug, you don't take it yourself.  And you certainly don't publicly brag about taking it . Trump's belief in his  personal privlege does not fit with this principle. It is evident in his 'leadership' style; he couldn't lead a scout troop to an ice cream parlour."
2020-05-19 16:45:04,"Why are we talking about this?? Why are we trying to determine if Trump is lying, yet again, about taking this drug, while his WH doctor has been vague in his report of whether he prescribed this drug. Why? Because Trump put this out yesterday to deflect from the real story of the day: that Inspector General Linick was fired because he was investigating Pompeo's approval of arms and  nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. The real story is that Trump is ridding the government of anyone who criticizes or investigates the possible corruption of his administration. Why is this not the major news on the front page of every newspaper and cable news network?"
2020-05-19 16:49:19,"Well he certainly showed up everyone who criticized his past medical recommendation to take a contraindicated drug.  

It's terrible to assume anyone might be lying about such a thing; and that it no longer matters that he occupies the office of the presidency.

2020-05-19 16:51:58,Both Trump and his physician are irresponsible for allowing Trump to take hydroxycholroquine and boast about it. To date there are no evidence this drug is helpful to prevent and/or treat Covid-19. I am certain Trump is getting frequent 12 ECGs to make sure that his QT interval (abnormal long QT is a predictor of development of potentially lethal heart rhythm disorders). The only reason Trump is taking this drug and boasting about is to show to his supported his disdain and distrust of experts. No wonder his supported are behaving most irresponsible way.
2020-05-19 16:54:12,Fact: The White House physician gave The Leader the go-ahead to take the drug. Fact: The Leader says he is taking the drug. Likelihood: The Leader is not taking the drug.

It did indeed help to stop the joint damage and provide some pain relief;  however, after about a year I had internal bleeding, in the upper gastrointestinal area with my becoming anemic.  I quit using the drug and just opted to learn to live with the pain and continuing joint damage.  This and other drugs of this nature are great if you are one of the lucky ones who have no side effects, but many other people are not so lucky.  It's a very powerful drug and must be used with care.  The internal effects happening inside the human body may not materialize for a period of time but can be devastating.  Their usage must be monitored constantly by a physician."

2020-05-19 17:24:36,"With almost a nonchalant expression on his face, Trump's announcement of his reliance on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prophylaxis, a verboten drug in the COVID-19 world, at least so far, for lack of demonstrable benefits, came as no surprise, given his pertinacious support for the drug, useful in treating malaria, lupus, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and rheumatoid arthritis. One can not simply fathom why. Yet, it is another one of his fusillade of flippant flapdoodles, he has been firing quite frequently.

Trump's top notch care, including, but not limited to, periodic EKGs, to monitor his cardiac rhythms, notwithstanding, this whole HCQ idea of his stinks to high heavens. He will not, evidently, care a rap. Even some of the FOX news channel reporters seemed peeved and miffed at his display of utterly exiguous wisdom. 

What was Sean Conley DO FACEP thinking? In the overall scheme of things, this is not to be dismissed as a bagatelle, but rather a serious matter of national importance. One wonders what entices Trump towards HCQ, and one may never know."
2020-05-19 17:20:52,"This is very irresponsible of the president.  Not only does it send a message to the public that it is safe for everyone, it sets up a potential demand for the drug that cannot be met.  There are many that take this drug for pre-existing conditions, such as Lupus.  Trials are going on, but sadly they only include in-patients; if this drug has possibilities, it will be in the early stages, before one is severe enough to be admitted.  Even then, it's important to understand if one has a heart condition as this drug would be contraindicated.

Lots of useful drugs have been around for a long time, and many if not most of them will harm or kill you if taken incorrectly. Even acetaminophen will cause permanent liver damage if misused.  Such an ignorant statement.  His hubris knows no bounds."
2020-05-19 18:34:27,"I think Trump is lying about taking hydroxychloroquine. If he was in fact taking the drug, the doctor in charge would be guilty of malpractice in treating the President of the United States. Trump lies repeatedly and often to the American public. And even when caught out in those lies – or misinformation as the press too often politely allowed – Trump usually doubles down. The man is incompetent! The man is also a dangerously dysfunctional narcissist. He is unfit to serve (and is also guilty of lawless behavior, abuse of power, and obstruction of justice.)
This travesty has gone on for way too long. The number of American dead from the covid19 pandemic is quickly approaching the number of American dead from the wars in Korea, Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the September 11th attack combined. Models have indicated the U.S. will achieve this tragic number sometime in June (more than 100,000 deaths.) Yet we still do not have a federally mandated standard for safely re-opening the country within strict CDC guidelines for preventing a second wave of infection that has ""teeth"" and a supply chain that is reliable for PPE and even basic necessities like toilet paper. That Trump is bragging about taking a drug proven to be ineffective against covid19 and that could endanger his life is all you need to know about his crippling incompetence. And I view the Senate's failure to remove Trump from office as criminal negligence."
2020-05-19 18:00:18,"Once again, Trump's imprimatur ends up discrediting things that actually have some value.  Lupus patients who take  hydroxychloroquine now have to contend not only with potential shortages -- but also with people who believe they're taking snake oil.  So do patients who have actually been treated for COVID-19 with it in a supervised hospital setting. And there really is a legitimate clinical trial on the stuff for milder COVID-19 cases:

While right-wing pundits tout hydroxychloroquine as some sort of COVID-19 miracle drug, some prominent left-wing media outlets have been incorrectly claiming it's been debunked as a treatment.  I hate to engage in ""both sides""-ism, but this is one time I've observed it to be the case."
2020-05-19 18:11:39,"I don't believe he's taking the drug at all.  I think he's just trying to justify that he even brought up so nonsensical/useless an idea. 
 
Also, it fits into his patter of stirring things up of the sake of distraction."
2020-05-19 18:12:24,Drinking chlorox to treat a coronavirus infection lacks a basic understanding of how a disinfectant works. Taking a drug prophylactically that is known to be an immunosuppressant in order to prevent a coronavirus infection lacks a basic understanding of how a serious infection can happen.
2020-05-19 18:28:32,"When I was very little, maybe 4 or 5, I used to sit on the floor with our dog, hand feeding him his dry food.  Every so often I was eat one of his kernels of food because he liked playing that game.  He would place his paw on my arm as if he was saying, 'Hey, that's my dinner, get your own"".  

And then one day my mother saw me eat a kernel of his dry dog food.  She simply stopped and ever so sweetly asked if I wanted to end up like a dog because I would if I kept eating his dog food.  She statement stopped me cold.

The application of Trump's logic would be correct in stating that I did not become a dog because I stopped eating dog food."
2020-05-19 18:28:51,"The President is trying to deflect attention from his disastrous leadership and it's time the Press quits taking the bait. The stories that matter are those that deal with getting our country back on its feet not the lunacy of a leader who doesn't believe in the expertise of his own agencies. This President has said lies, nonsense, and plain idiocies from day one and will continue until he's passed from this world. Another shocking assertion tomorrow should not be a headline but should be listed as a mere footnote in a long list of egregious comments.  Otherwise, the press is just giving this spoiled child more of the attention he craves."

2020-05-19 18:16:12,"Well, as we've all been reminded endlessly--it's all about him.  So, there must be a personal financial interest for him and/or his toadies.  And the odds he's actually ingesting the drug are just about zero.  He just wants us to think so 'cause there's money to be made."
2020-05-19 18:17:35,"We'll never know if he's really taking it. But viewed through the prism of the latest headlines about him firing yet another Inspector General, it's more likely just another diversion for the media to chase after."
2020-05-19 18:18:16,"First off, I'll say, I am not a fan (of Trump).  However, I have to ask, why are we surprised he's taking this medicine?  If you've watched television during the lockdown, you can see that every other commercial is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company pushing their medication.  You just have to ""ask your doctor.""  Most of the medicine on t.v. seems to have dreadful side effects.  Yet, pharmaceutical companies know that doctors are afraid not to prescribe a medicine if the patient asks for it.  It seems to me, that's all Trump did.  And, I have to say, at least he was totally open and honest about it."
2020-05-19 18:21:43,"The way Trump keeps barking for this particular medicine can only mean one thing--that he thinks there's some financial or personal profit in pushing it.  Would be interesting to see what a little investigative journalism might turn up--could makers of the components for hydrochl. be key Trump sponsors, perhaps?"
2020-05-19 18:26:26,"This development raises an interesting epistemological question.  The notion that Trump is taking an anti-malerial agent for no good reason, and against medical advice and bragging about it, thus undercutting others in his administration  who are way, way, WAY more qualified than he is, is perfectly plausible.  But if that' s what he's doing, it also means he's telling the truth about it-- and he's demonstrated to us that it's comparably implausible for him to tell the truth.  Wow.

A commenter below wrote that Trump is suffering from a severe mental illness.  I have two quibbles with that idea.  First, HE'S not suffering at all.  He's inflicting suffering on US.  That's a hallmark more of character pathology than illness.

Second, now that I've retired, I can tell you both that I worked for 24 years as a forensic and correctional psychiatrist in a high security federal prison hospital that had nearly 300 beds filled with severely mentally ill convicted federal prisoners and insanity acquittees.  Many psychiatrists hasten to remind the public that the vast majority of persons with mental illness do not pose a danger to others, which is correct.  Similarly, I can tell you that the vast majority of my seriously impaired ill charges, most of whom had lengthy criminal records, had far more common sense than does Trump. 

And acted far less boorishly."
2020-05-19 18:05:13,"For a guy who said the virus ""would just disappear"" it makes no sense to be taking anything. Then again, he said similar and flopped multiple times on testing... just another day in Chaos, D.C."
2020-05-19 18:21:06,"Chances are that he is lying about it. I don't think he is taking it. By saying that he is taking it, he expects his followers to do the same (if they can get their hands on it somehow) and instill a false sense of effective prophylaxis; thereby expecting that his base will rebel against the quarantine. Truth be told, the safety margin of the drug is wide and most will not be affected by it. It will be very easy to downplay the small proportion of adversaties (even if fatal) as it will not be easy to prove causality exclusively from hydroxychloroquine ...... and he knows this."

2020-05-19 18:25:26,"I was prescribed and took Plaquenil for a couple of years after a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis/Crohn's Disease. Yearly eye specialist exams were mandated as this drug can cause retina damage, even years after ceasing to take the drug. I took this drug daily for 2 years until a different treatment was used; my daily dose/length of time taking hydroxychloroquine would fit the ""chronic use"" criteria. Successive Eye exams during and after taking Plaquenil were normal and I was told my eyes were healthy. 3 years after stopping, the yearly comprehensive eye exam showed a different picture. My left eye has crosshatch marks on my retina; my vision is blurred at the upper left quadrant of my left eye. I had no illness or trauma since the prior eye exam. My eye specialist and my Rheumatologist discussed the results with me and noted that Plaquenil should not be prescribed or taken again by me. While the length of time to take the drug as part of a ""Covid19 cure"" seems short in duration, taking Plaquenil as a prophylactic measure is profoundly ill advised by me. This drug did help make my painful swollen joints tolerable and my quality of life better.  Stuff happens."

From what the White House physcian said in his letter, it certainly doesn't look like the prescription came from there.  All that letter says is that Trump discussed the efficacy of the drug with the physician. Where did the prescription came from then?   Or perhaps Trump--Wizard of Oz redivivus--is just pretending in his dangerous and misguided effort to cover up  his immense failures.  I'm more terrified about what he'll do next than of the virus itself."

As it is NOT for the 'prevention' of anything...what's the condition, Mr. President??"
2020-05-19 18:56:59,"I don’t believe for a moment that Trump is really taking this drug. He may be a fool, but by many accounts  he’s a severely neurotic, hypochondriacal fool.  I would suggest that he’s just reacting to the “60 Minutes” segment on Dr. Rick Bright. Trump can never be wrong and he thinks by announcing he’s taking Hydroxychloroquine and remaining in the best health of any human being who has ever lived, he will have proven that it’s the medical professionals who were wrong. In his severely narcissistic mind, he assumes we will then heap praise upon him for having the knowledge and courage to save us all from acquiring the virus. It’s just one more lie coming out of the mouth of a man who is still attempting to convince his father, even though the man is long deceased, that he’s smart, strong, and worthy of being loved. I wish him luck with that endeavor. If there is any afterlife, Dr. Trump may send many of his most ardent believers to a place where his father will greet them, telling them what fools they were to listen to his foolish son."

2020-05-19 18:58:47,"My guess is that Trump is so terrified of the virus that he’s grasping at straws.  At some level, he may even understand that taking hydroxychloroquine is not safe.  But he probably also realizes that the White House’s testing protocol is inadequate and that he may well have been exposed to the virus.

In this situation, the scientific response would be to self-isolate for two weeks (wearing a mask is also indicated).  Other world leaders have done exactly that.  But Trump has trouble distinguishing science from magic.  In the end, the snake-oil salesman is consuming his own product."

And should these individuals suffer any consequences it means nothing to Donald Trump. For our Commander in Chief to maintain such a dangerous thought process at this moment shows how incredibly divorced he is from reality. What medical pearls of wisdom will Donald Trump next utter? Advocating again for the injection of disinfectants? Taking the next medication he hears about that in his mind sounds like a winner?

2020-05-19 10:50:56,"Almost certainly he is not actually taking the medicine. This is pretty unpleasant to take, even in low doses. What is far more likely is that he is signaling to his followers the doubling down on his previous pronouncements, simultaneously offering an implicit reason for not wearing a mask. More likely what is happening is that he is being tested and testing obsessively everyone in his orbit. Rather than admit this embarrassing fact, he distracts with the chloroquine claim."
2020-05-19 10:54:36,"Trump’s worst problem isn’t taking hydroxychloroquine, it is psychological. He wills to believe things that have no factual basis. In earlier times, such people were given the freedom to pursue their beliefs as long as they were also willing to accept the natural consequences of their irrational actions. Our nanny state has made natural consequences much harder to come by through putting up lots of guardrails in society. This is a net good because the society ends up paying for things like ER visits resulting from such belief and action. But it has also helped to spawn a sub-culture of disbelief of authorities with dismal consequences. The push to open up the economy while ignoring social distancing rules is an example and if you look at maps published in this paper, such behavior is concentrated in red states, the old Confederacy. I say, let them do as they wish and let them, Trump included, suffer the natural consequences. The looming election will be decided by the survivors."

2020-05-19 19:42:21,Why should we believe he is taking hydroxychloroquine?  He never puts himself at risk.  I would wager that this is just one more lie.
2020-05-19 19:23:45,"I noticed a key detail in Dr. Conley's letter that the Times' reporter appears to have overlooked: Nowhere does it state explicitly that Trump is actually taking HCQ -- it only says that he and Trump discussed its risks and benefits. I hope a sharp White House correspondent picks up on this detail and asks pointed, specific questions about the exact dosage and regimen prescribed by Conley at the next press briefing.

Personally, I strongly suspect Trump is not really taking this drug. Rather, this is likely yet another Trump misdirection, possibly aimed at convincing his supporters (who are generally not well-educated or versed in critical thinking) that it's safe to return to work if they first bug their doctors for prophylactic HCQ. Unfortunately, this will have the very real effect of further curtailing the availability of the drug for the malaria and lupus patients who actually need it."
2020-05-19 19:03:53,"As an MD, I'd call attention to how much we already know about how drugs like this act on the heart. This effect is routinely measured using electrocardiograms (ECG's) which show that these drugs cause the QT interval to become prolonged.  The longer the QT interval, the higher the risk of a deadly arrhythmia (torsades de pointes). Hydroxychloroquine is among the many drugs which are known to lengthen the QT interval. In patients who have a relatively long QT interval at their baseline for another reason (perhaps, due to another drug they need), extra caution is needed when starting a drug -- like hydroxychloroquine -- which will further prolong their QT interval. 
   It could save lives if the media coverage on this topic provided more information about the cardiac risks of drugs like this."
2020-05-19 12:32:39,"It's a shocker.  Or is it?  Trump is setting a poor example, we are told, by announcing that he takes chloroquine.   It's as if he doesn't set other poor examples.  For me, he is so steeped in setting poor examples that this one, to add to the list, poor as it is, is also not the most egregious.  Consider first the daily poor examples of ethical and moral behavior that we now recognize as normal for him."
2020-05-19 20:23:23,"There must be a valid medical reason for someone to begin taking a drug such as Hydroxychloroquine . Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. The reason why it can be beneficial in patients infected by the Coronavirus is because it reduces inflammation. It doesn’t cure Coronavirus or prevent someone from developing it. The adverse effects of this drug includes cardiotoxicity which can result in heart failure. This is why to use this drug for any reason that it is not intended for can cause harm."
2020-05-19 20:39:37,"Would it be judged malpractice or criminal if the President's  own Rx for hydroxychloroquine sulfate were to be filled with a placebo sugar pill or nutritional supplement? 

The Hippocratic oath is to do no harm.  Pity a sycophantic provider facing this dilemma:

Humor and possibly harm the President by giving him genuine hydroxychloroquine.  OR-- covertly prescribe a placebo to humor and protect the patient from his own ignorance.

Meanwhile, the rest of us have already suffered a greater harm--our collective distraction

Weeks ago, many media outlets sensibly ceased broadcasting  POTUS's daily posturing during the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings. Why are we still giving so much coverage to the President's erratic aerosol bluster?"
2020-05-19 20:44:05,"According to the manufacturer, there is a risk of heart attack.  According to Trump, he has been taking it for over a week.  He probably would be at risk, ""if he only had a heart."""
2020-05-19 20:47:01,"So, the Donald is doing fine taking hydroxychloroquine. He doesn't have malaria - the disease for which it it approved. He doesn't (yet) have coronavirus, for which the drug is nearly contraindicated, but is, at least, ineffective. One wonders if he'll be among the unlucky who develop severe cardiac problems from the drug. 

But, more than anything I wonder how on earth Trump got a prescription for hydroxochloroquine, when he has no reason to be taking it. His health care is payed for by our tax dollars, now. His use of hydroxochloroquine is egregious waste - something for which our health care system is famed.

Obviously, Trump cares nothing about the ""example"" he is setting. But he should."
2020-05-19 21:42:06,"True.. Or not?  We cannot even believe this from this man, that is how little credibility and relationship he has with the truth.

Hopefully, people are not looking to him for medical guidance.. that would be foolish indeed.

Interesting how this follows the positive test of his valet and Pence press secretary.

Maybe just another shiny object thrown across the floor to distract from the mess that is Pandemic President's administration,  and poor response to this pandemic."
2020-05-19 21:12:17,"Not again!  It was finally getting easier to get my prescription filled (for lupus, not for some speculative purpose) and now it'll be another mess.

I think pharmacies, or at least some of them, are getting better at dealing with this.  My pharmacy has been overwhelmed and understaffed since March, and it's been taking 4-8 days to get routine prescriptions filled.  My hydroxychloroquine prescription became available for refill today and it was filled two hours after the pharmacy opened.  The pharmacist clearly moved my prescription to the front of the line.  Nothing else I have pending has been filled. 

Once again, I've been lucky, and a lot of people who desperately need this medication will not be.  Lupus is the pits, truly - don't we have enough to deal with already?  Did the president really have to make the lives of a deeply vulnerable population harder, again?"
2020-05-19 21:20:56,"This drug has proven quite efficient as an early Covid-19 treatment in the institute led by Pr Didier Raoult in Marseille France. The problem with it, is that it is extremely cheap, which can probably explain the hostile clamors against, voiced out by many medical mandarins, deeply involved with large laboratories in their frantic search for their jackpot! Hence the international barrage.
I am deeply sorry to suggest that, on this one, Trump is probably right. 
Yet, the Raoult protocol, object of hasted criticism, needs to be administered under strict medical surveillance. So, why not moving Trump to Marseille?"
2020-05-19 20:12:06,I would be willing to bet that Trump has Covid 19.  Chloroquine is not approved for prevention.  I bet his aid got it from him.
2020-05-19 22:26:40,"And now... the FDA is soft pedaling its initial cautions against taking the drug sayin ""ultimately it is a decision between a patient and their physician"". I am certain the science has not changed in the intervening period so I can only conclude that the fingerprints of the administration are all over their keyboard."
2020-05-19 22:46:41,"Well, there are many medical doctors in the U.S and in Europe who have supported the use of the drug and no doubt many medical staff in NYC who are taking it. So it would only be fair to admit this though the Times and its liberal readers always find a way to ignore it. As a group the liberal elite are more likely to believe in alternative medical treatments; use pot smoking as a cure for whatever ails them; more likely to self medicate themselves and children with drugs used for ADD; more likely to engage in psychotherapies; more likely to follow diet and food fads; more likely to believe that vaccines causes autism; more likely to believe in many things that Science would claim is not science and can pose dangers like not getting vaccines. Yet all this is forgiven on behalf of the liberal elite because they and only they follow the high standards of Science but not Trump. Really?  How Much medical science do any of you know? Speak to a hospital pharmacist and see how often doctors prescribe off label drugs to patients for many reasons and with serious dangers. How and why drugs are prescribed is not always clear cut and medical professionals often take prescribed drugs in ways they would not give to their patients but which they think might be effective. Must everything be seen as either anti or pro Trump? How many of you have taken or asked your doctor to prescribe to you drugs that were not recommended?  The more rich and liberal you are the more likely."
2020-05-19 21:25:53,"It appears ""evident"" that whoever among the throng of doctors in Donald's entourage is orchestrating his hydroxychloroquine regimen is not in the ""range of medical experts"" warning against its use. That clinical professional (?) remains silent, as often is the case with his sycophants, knowing the consequences of speaking out. I for one would love to hear that doctor's opinion; not holding my breath!"
2020-05-19 22:17:27,"On one hand, it's good to see that he's putting his money where his mouth is. On the other hand, how would one actually distinguish the common side effects of an overdose of this drug from Trump's normal behavior?"
2020-05-19 20:02:34,"Trump also refuses to wear a mask like the rest of us peons. As a narcissist he doesn't want to ruin his photo and TV image.  Fervently hope with fingers crossed that he comes down with the coronavirus so that he can unequivocally report to his followers that the coronavirus is no worse than the common flu.  He can then also report whether taking hydroxychloroquine works or not (assuming that he is not lying, and that he is really not taking it).  If hydroxychloroquine doesn't work he can then take his disinfectants.  Trump will have done the country a tremendous service to test whether these cures work or not, the only positive thing he has done during this crisis."
2020-05-19 19:55:41,"Trump isn't setting a bad example.  Saying ""irresponsible"" and ""sad"" and ""delusional"" is missing the terrifying point.  He's showing his right-wing followers (QAnon and allies) that he's on their side.  They embraced hyydroxywhatever as a treatment BECAUSE only one doctor said it worked, and BECAUSE Fauci and others contradicted Trump's statements about it.  This is how he shows his worst base that he is still their protector. 
 
He won't back away from any conspriacy until the worst right wing trolls start to reject it.  Everything he does is for them.  He has to show, again and again, that he supports their love of conspiracy theories and their rejection of logic.  If he wins in November, it's a huge win for trolls and paranoid conspiracy theorists, and that won't go well for civilization."
2020-05-19 19:55:41,"Trump isn’t “taking” chloroquine, he’s invested in it.  Somehow, someway, he’s making money off this.  Guaranteed."
2020-05-19 20:12:29,"President Trump should immediately stop taking hydroxychloroquine.

It has not been shown to prevent coronavirus infection or approved for use in relation to coronavirus. 

In addition, it can have severe or even fatal side effects. 

As president, Trump must set a better example.  Repeatedly, he has not.

And who is the quack WH physician who gave Trump the approval?  Another fawning sycophant who is afraid to contradict Trump and only conveys information that Trump wants to hear instead of the truth.

And I'm sure Trump mentioned hydroxychloroquine yesterday simply to undercut and cast doubt on Dr. Rick Bright, his testimony last week before the Congress and his 60 Minutes interview on Sunday."
2020-05-19 20:32:36,"Trump SAYS he is taking hydroxychloroquine. That does not mean he IS taking it. The presidency has many uses for the likes of Trump. One such is the ability to sell brands so that the manufacturer turns around and puts money in his campaign coffers. Can someone look into this please !! Also, can someone tell me if there is a shortage in availability of this drug for people who really need it? Which quack doctor serves the president that he/(she) is writing him prescriptions for this drug without any medical indication?. This person should be charged with malpractice. But above all is Trump's amazing inability to think logically that should trouble us. He takes hydroxychloroquine (let's assume he speaks the truth, who knows) he tests negative. Where is the link between cause and effect? I eat a banana everyday and I too am negative. Heee Heee!!!"
2020-05-19 21:16:12,"Every time he opens his mouth, a lie falls out. I don't believe he is taking the drug, at least not chloroquine. He is not stupid and knows it is dangerous. He is dangerous. I do believe he is trying to sell it, promote it. He's got stock or will get kick back from the profits."
2020-05-19 21:22:24,"It comes in a blister pack. I doubt he knows how to remove a pill from a blister pack. 

So, that means someone is giving him a white pill and telling him it's hydroxychloroquine.  It's probably an aspirin, or a Tic Tac."
2020-05-19 21:25:59,"If Donald Trump is stating publicly that he is taking hydroxychloroquine then given his disdain for the truth the odds are fairly unlikely that he is actually taking it. Expect a ridiculous, childish retraction from him in the near future, blaming the press for spreading “fake news”, which of course he only meant as “sarcasm”!"
2020-05-19 21:41:23,Hydroxychloroquine is an immunosuppressant. People with a suppressed immune system are at a higher risk of a serious coronavirus infection. Taking hydroxychloroquine prophylactically is dumb.
2020-05-19 21:42:10,"I take Hydroxchloroquine for lupus. It is an effective drug for lupus. My doctor does monitor my consumption of this drug. For Trump to take it as a preventative for Covid 19 is stupid and dangerous, not to mention that his use prevents those of us who take it for good reason have trouble getting it. It does not surprise me that he is this selfish. Not to recognize the danger  of the way he's taking it shows his stupidity; he is such a liar he might not be taking it at all."
2020-05-19 22:09:47,"Who is going to believe this guy; one day he says one thing and next he changes his mind 180˚, even if he took it, good riddance; and I really mean it!!!!   Now some people believe he is setting a poor example, well, he isn't setting any example; couldn't even if he wanted to!!

2020-05-19 19:52:30,He needs to quadruple his dose because it is not having the desired effect.

2020-05-19 21:33:11,"So now US President says that medical study about a drug he has decided to prescribe for himself and for the nation is an ""anti Trump enemy statement"". This is genuinely insane. Certifiable. Proof beyond any lingering doubt of total unfitness for office."

2020-05-19 23:08:39,"Trump is putting his money where his mouth is.  Is the drug preventing him from catching COVID?  We can't know that.  Pelosi said, in her typical ingenuous way, that he was morbidly obese and shouldn't be taking it.  Morbidly obese?  Is she now a physician?  I would venture to say Trump is robustly healthy considering the number of hours he puts in and his level of energy.  If that's the result of being morbidly obese, we should all wish for that!

Hydroxychloroquine  is given as a treatment and a prophylaxis to individuals not under the duress of the virus, but of autoimmune disorder.  This drug's contraindications for the general population, as a viral therapy,  is unknown.  That is why medical scientists do testing.  Just how alarming can anti-intellectualism get?"

Firstly,  I don't believe he is taking the medication. His minimal information on what/how he is taking it make me suspicious. 

Secondly, those of us Lupus, RA, other autoimmune patients who need this drug to address our symptoms better not have more problems in filling/refilling Hydroxychloroquine as we did the first time the president tried to see this drug for treatment of Covid-19. 

The one thing that puzzles me is it takes 2-3 months for Lupus patients to see an effect of this drug so I'm at a loss to understand how anyone can take this and have an immediate effect. BTW insurance rarely if ever covers the cost of medications used in off labe use."

The chances of this being truthful are next to zero given his proclivity for constant lies.  He has grabbed the headlines again.  And, in three days as attention fades away, he will grab the headlines once again with another outrageous lie or action without causing any positive changes for the good in this country. 

It goes on and on.

The burqa and other types of face veils have been attested since pre-Islamic times. Face veiling has not been regarded as a religious requirement by most Islamic scholars, past or present. This nonsense has to stop! These ridiculous accusations of discrimination are only playing in the hands of Islamophobes/anti-Muslim elements in Europe! Allowing the burqa in Europe would only reinforce the already widespread feeling that Muslims are trying to impose their norms on Europeans and, if anything, by European standards, the burqa itself is an unacceptable symbol of discrimination against women.

He will remove all gear in between one room and the next, dispose of possible virus infected garments, don new sterile PPE and then enter.
  Wrapping cabin crew in full hazmat gear and then going from passenger to passenger without following above routine is simply moving possible virus from person to person.

2020-05-21 00:26:42,"China should not be given undue importance or exaggerated admiration. The only reason its lock down worked was because it was enforced with an iron hand and with lock and key. No free western democracies could have or can take away uniformly civil liberties and effectively enforce safe discipline to comply with safety precautions, China is more homogeneous society than western democracies in following their governments orders. China also had valuable experience from dealing with the SARS corona virus which it contained more effectively from spreading globally than it did the COVID-19. China will be emboldened to become more invasive and virulent if the error of its ways are not condemned and reprimanded with punitive measures short of poking the dragon in the eye."
2020-05-21 02:07:04,"All travellers arriving in Hong Kong have to walk past temperature screening cameras, and they have done, off and on, since 2003 when we were hit by SARS.    That experience, and subsequent scares about MERS, Bird Flu etc, have made the people here readily and proactively willing to wear face masks and keep their hands clean.
Maybe thats why, out of a population of 7,500,000+, and sitting right next door to China, we have only had just over 1,000 Covid 19 cases and 4 deaths."

2020-05-19 19:59:50,"I’ve lived in Hong Kong for the past 24 years and have some idea as to why Hong Kong has faired out well during the Covid-19 pandemic despite their proximity to mainland China, population density and high pollution levels.

First of all, Hong Kong retained a number of measures set in place during SARS, such as the constant cleaning (in some places as frequently as every 30 minutes) of surfaces such as elevator buttons, door handles and deep cleaning of public transport vehicles on a daily basis. 

As soon as the territory became aware of the virus everyone donned a face mask (even pre-Covid it was not uncommon to come across people wearing face masks when they had colds, etc.,it became the thing to do after SARS). 

Integrated systems between health departments, communities, hospitals, doctors’ offices set in place during SARS were still in place and ready to kick into gear upon the emergence of Covid. 

People know how to sneeze and cough properly, even very young children (a lot of people in North America still sneeze or cough into their hands). 

Everyone has access to extremely inexpensive, excellent health care and pharmaceuticals. And, Hong Kong people are overwhelming free of the preexisting conditions that make Covid more devastating such as obesity and diabetes. 

And, finally pre-Covid, I could have challenged anyone to find someone in Hong Kong who did not have on their possession a bottle of hand sanitizer. Carrying hand sanitizer is very common and applied often."
2020-05-19 20:42:31,This is an extremely interesting portrayal of a megacity where the pandemic (at least for now) is under control. I find it impossible to imagine only 3 new cases in a single day (much less an entire month) where I live anytime in the next year. Please offer us more insights about how doctors' offices and houses of worship function and have changed in Hong Kong. How do they envisage the reopening of schools and museums?
2020-05-19 22:21:26,"Very proud of the progress and good luck to all from my home city. 

On a side note, I think one of the reasons the pandemic and the subsequent measures were not being carried out effectively and efficiently is the lack of centralized managed healthcare system. 

Culturally, Hongkongers and East Asians, generally speaking, adopt the Confucius thinking that one's own desires is secondary to the needs of the group and the good of society. This collective responsibility guides members of the society to act accordingly, in the face of health crisis, even if that means sacrifice one's freedom and comfort, e.g. trapping in a small apartment with your whole family. 

On the other hand, the individualism celebrated in the west, especially in the U.S., could be the root cause of openly disobedience of social distancing and other best practice suggested by health authority. 

Just thinking out loud from someone has lived in both cultures."

2020-05-19 19:50:14,"The entire world has been upside down since covid struck Wuhan and it spread like wildfire to other parts of planet earth. Never in history of mankind there was so much fear and anguish; pandemic has painted literally a doomsday scenario. Sometimes you wake up in the morning like you've seen a scary Hollywood scripted movie but the harsh reality is it's real and hurting real bad with no end in sight. The demonstrations are spreading from American cities to Scotland and Germany and I'm afraid it could lead to protests like yellow vest movement or other anarchists ventures. The social stratification has further deteriorated for middle and lower income brackets. There are apprehensions that afro American Hispanic Asian covid patients are not given best of the care in American hospitals. Conspiracy theorist also point a finger at pharmaceutical conglomerates, compromised reserachers, few billionaires competing for share of vaccine bounty from the magic drug. Rick Bright has exposed  the gross misconduct and extreme negligence at the highest echelons of federal government, FDA, and research centres. Of course there is a commercial and political trajectory to this crisis.

It's for sure the world is not the same after this virus outbreak. The feeling of insecurity is ten folds more than nine eleven tragedy. America  and China are threatening each other with trade tariffs. There is high volatility in South China sea; Chinese ambassador died  in Tel vive, not a good omen at all!"
2020-05-19 20:52:52,"The only certain thing in life is it’s uncertainty. Life throws us curve ball, we just have to deal with it, learn from it, and move on with our life the best we can. This is resiliency. 

Looks like we have a lot to learn from these East Asian countries, like Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong as reported in this article."
2020-05-19 23:39:57,"The rest of the world ought to figure out exactly why Hong Kong is so successful in limiting the spread of Covid-19. As of today, the city - with over 7 million residents and a population density higher than that of NYC (when accounting for the fraction of area actually developed) - has logged just over 1,000 cases and 4 deaths. This is incredible - what's going on there? Have Hong Kongers acquired immunity from their past experiences with viral outbreaks? Or are masking, hand-cleansing, and social distancing as practiced there sufficient to eliminate the contagion? I'd like to understand it."
2020-05-19 23:46:18,"Ironically, Hong Kong's successful containment is partly attributed to the population's deep distrust of the Chinese Government.

1.) People started wearing masks here (against WHO recommendations) in early January when China claimed there's no human to human transmission for the then 'mystery pneumonia in Wuhan'
2.) While Beijing certainly wouldn't allow Hong Kong authorities to impose a ban on arrivals from China, medics in HK striked and successfully managed to pressure the government to impose a mandatory two week quarantine on arrivals from China."

2020-05-20 00:49:27,"It seems strange to see people in the picture sitting face to face without masks.  
My new normal is masks and gloves whenever I walk out of my house.  On return, I clean my gloves and mask with hydrogen per oxide. I wash my hands and face with soap.
I keep strict social distancing.  
Such cavalier scene as in this bar seems unreal."
2020-05-20 04:59:54,"My first visit to Hong Kong was in 1939 with my parents to avoid the Japanese air force bombings in China. As a kid I didn't understand what was the British colony all about. But I really enjoyed the new western style of life. Eating ice creams and drink milk shakes. I fell in love with Hong Kong. I learned English in my elementary school and Cantonese dialect. We stayed in Hong Kong until the Japanese attack Hong Kong in Dec., 1941. Our house was bombed by the Japanese and  I saw the Japanese atrocities and we left  Hong Kong for Shanghai. After WWII I returned to Hong Kong and later I came to this country to continue my education. I wonder how many Hong Kongers are there to remember the good old days of Hong Kong. To me, the British colonial days were much orderly in Hong Kong. No demonstrations and disruptions by the refugees from mainland China. I still visit Hong Kong every year and trying to remember my younger years there with my parents and friends. Today's Hong Kong is a different Hong Kong. Under the pressure of the Chinese Communist Party. Life is free but not really free. Because you always feel there someone looking after you. Am I over reacted? I just love the Dairy Farms ice cream and also the afternoon teas in a major hotel in Kowloon. Our first house was in Robinson Road and the last house was in the Causeway Bay area, with beautiful of the harbor views. I plan to visit Hong Kong when this pandemic is over, I hope it will be soon."

And when I rode the MTR, there were plenty of other passengers, everyone wearing a protective mask.  It’s scary that Black Shirts are so itchy to riot again.  As You wrote, restaurants are closing in mass and hotels could follow soon.  One night, I stayed in a 250 room, 31/2 star hotel hotel in Wanchai.  2 rooms were occupied, mine and one other."
2020-05-20 10:55:10,"The HK govt. has done a fantastic job in handling the Covid-19 outbreak.  Only 4 people in the city have died from the infection.  The USA has about 45 times the population of HK’s 7.5 million people.  And HK is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.  If the U.S. had the same death rate as in HK from the infection, our country would have suffered 180 deaths.  How many deaths from Covid-19 have occurred so far in the USA?  92,000 deaths and counting."

Not to mention the old T-shirts that look like Jesus doing a puship under a cross that say ""God's Gym.""

If spirituality helps your fitness and mindfulness about your wellbeing that's one thing--there's even a program of Jesuit yoga out there that uses Christian meditations--but using the Stations of the Cross as a background for a workout as if there's some kind of comparison is one of the worst cases of misplaced pietyI've seen in a while."

2020-05-19 20:17:57,"Temperature checks demonstrate a misunderstanding of the risks this virus poses. It is possible to be infected with the virus for up to 14 days before symptoms begin to show, and to be contagious for the entirety of that period. That’s the whole point of shutdowns, social distancing and canceling of events. None of us can say at any given moment with any real certainty that we’re not sick. The real danger at events like this won’t be from  obviously sick people making poor decisions; it will be from people who don’t yet realize they’re sick spreading it around, and temperature checks won’t do anything to solve that."

He'll retire with a great pension and enter an industry with a golden future. I highly encourage a minimum of four years of service before you go off to college. That's what I did and it really paid off for me."
2020-05-20 21:05:46,"The military has many great training and educational opportunities for young people. Four years of training and experience, and world travel can be a very rewarding stepping stone to a real career. My 22 years in the Army Reserve (1970-1992) has another great benefit...a pension! With jobs becoming scarce, a conversation with a recruiter could be a game changer for many."

On the other hand, now that Trump is unilaterally getting us out of all the wars, and hearing that military aides are delegated to walking dogs and fetching the dry cleaning, it makes one wonder just how many people they really need.  The military is long overdue a real audit!

Personally, I think the first people to be sent over to a conflict should be one of the President’s kids, if they are over 18. It’s easy to send everyone else’s kids. The whole administration needs some “kin” in the game. Send in Don Jr or Eric or Ivanka. And not as officers! Prince Harry served his country in a fighting mission. Maybe we would use peaceful options a tad more."

Second, they should reach out to all (ASVAB and PFT qualified) veterans, who have been discharged within the last seven years and willing to accept a temporary reduction of rank.

Between these two groups are the USA's five thousand that would have quickly entered the ""pipeline "" and not have caused a gap in our readiness. It's all about the MOS, isn't it?c"

2020-05-20 20:46:56,"Once recruits are placed in a training company, they are almost totally isolated, and the experience should be much like being on an island that had never seen the disease.  Things mediating against that goal, are the entry quarantine process and encounters during training with persons who interact with the outside world, such as training cadre and cafeteria staff.  I think there should be a shift to supervised quarantine prior to boot camp; also, rotation to permanent staff who are single and can be housed on the base itself.  Relying on outdated methods, such as temperature checks (studies have demonstrated that up to a third of infected persons do not show elevated temperatures at some time in their infection), will not help the process."

Boomers got pensions but pulled up the ladder behind them.  Boomers got highly subsidized college educations but raised tuition for the younger set. Boomers failed to invest in infrastructure.  Boomers drove up the national debt.  Boomers never faced an employment crisis.

Maybe they feel bad for their children and grandchildren, but they don't feel bad for anyone else's children and grandchildren - at least enough to act on it.

I recovered and made great money over my career.  It is possible.  However, I had a degree in a skill field (accounting) and no student loans (I worked multiple jobs year round to pay for my college).  Today's students need to focus on career fields that create skills in demand and not just general business , literature and the arts or creative studies.  Technical skills are still in demand (accounting, engineering, computer science) and will be for the future.  Those with good technical degrees may have to wait a few years for the recovery (like I did) but with hard work and persistence they will have the same opportunities for lifetime earnings.  I lived it and encourage today's students to get better degrees specially if you need to borrow for college and work hard.  View a student loan as a business loan.  What career are you getting and how much more will you make with that career to justify the loan.  Good luck and don't give up."

I don't regret my time in service to my community and when I become an elder I hope to return to doing another shift in a fulltime volunteer corps.

I imagine Americorps is full up already. I hope they expand with the increased need in our nation and the increased availability of so many young people. Student loan payments are suspended during volunteerism, or at least they were in the 1990s."

I live in Rockport, TX, a small tourist country.  We were just recovering from Hurricane Harvey, some businesses never made it back from that, now at least half of those who did will not make it back from this lock down. We have finally had a 3rd case in our county, acquired at a hospital in the closest city, Corpus Christi.

Having everyone in rural areas closed because the very largest cities were in danger was a real mistake.  The country was doing very well.  Now I am starting to believe the whole quarantine thing was started just to stop Trump's  re-election, throwing out the great economy we were experiencing.

I figured I'd have a shot at something, but it took a year and a half to get a living wage position. I consider myself lucky that it worked out in the end because I know a lot of people with astronomical debt or who were unable to secure a job. The hit to my confidence during such a biologically impressionable period was seismic, though, and I still have immense trouble shaking risk aversion as a result of that experience. To the recent grads: focus on your well-being. The wider situation will eventually change but your coping systems will be tested.

We have now seen how unsustainably our just-in-time supply chains function from food to medical equipment to bicycles.  They'd been globally sourced and fine-tuned for decades to stretch profitability as far as possible.  Whole countries had focused on their core competencies and natural resource strengths to be part of the global business system.  Debt-levels at companies are maintained to leverage profitability and growth.  Everything in a modern corporation is fined-tuned in that way.

I'd say he has stuff to unlearn from his college years.  He attended in another era.  There is much more clarity about the realities of our society than there was in 2019.  The neoliberal experiment has failed.  Surely more trade-analyst jobs will go away.  Perhaps new graduates should chill and think about our collective future.  Student loans are deferrable.  What are these young people after when they're my age, 55, marginal economic superiority over fellow citizens in a vastly degraded environment?  His generation is not disadvantaged.  Rather they'll fall further behind if they jump on the broken bandwagon of neoliberal capitalism.  Are they after McMansions with big yards to mow?  What are they falling behind, the American Dream?

And while I have more money in my savings than others my age due to the fact I live at home, most, or not all, of it will be gone if I move and don't have a job.

Memory is clear; standing in line with 40 other folks for a food serving position, interviewing with UPS for a 3AM shift at a transfer facility - culminating in a bus boy gig because that's the only offer I was extended. Unable to keep up with bills and facing default on student loans, I moved back in with an elderly dad who has a generous pension, spending the next 8 years doing odd jobs, intermittently working as a retail merchandiser. In 2010, I was able to leverage my""sales"" experience into a full time, $30K per year, salaried position.

10 years on and through a series of job changes, I've finally realized an higher earnings potential in a business designated ""essential,"" albeit not in the field of my choosing. Career ambitions were scuttled a long time ago. Had it not been for Income Based Repayment, I would've defaulted on student loans, on which the outstanding principles are only NOW starting to go down. I'm 49 years old.

When I finally got a professional gig 2 years later, it meant living in a shed in someone’s backyard....under the table income for them, a marginal roof for me.

My larger point is that the nursing assistant work taught me so much about work and myself that I ended up going back to school for my nursing degree. I have been proud to work as an RN for the last 33 years. So a recession can teach lessons that are not always apparent at the time."

2020-05-19 14:29:48,"I was a couple years out of college in 2008/9, when I was laid off from my job. I immediately went to graduate school to get a master’s and take shelter from the ravaged economy. That was the best decision I could have made. It was a $30k commitment on top of my undergraduate loans a tough, hard scrabble year after I finished by degree, but I got an excellent union job at a utility company where I have flourished professionally. All is not hopeless, class of 2020. It is more work, though, and more tenuous than what your parents dealt with at your age."
2020-05-19 14:38:18,"I studied five generations of my family in NY Metro.  Every generation was different, and had different challenges.

Depression, WWII, wars, recessions, etc.  In ALL cases, education always had value.

Use this time to get any job, go to school nights and be patient while times improve.

Me, a poor Polish boy from Greenpoint, with great parents, managed to get much education, and finally started my own business, which I still own and run today at 78 years old.

There will always be opportunities if you look for them, are willing to work hard, and endures some minor sacrifices.

With our Constitution and Bill of Rights, the sky's the limit, and I am also a pilot!"

I washed dishes for six months, saved  a thousand dollars, then hitchhiked and bummed around Europe for a year, often sleeping rough.  Best decision I ever made.  Unfortunately that option is not available now either."
2020-05-19 14:40:28,"Give me a break. First of all every person in this article you showcase is WHITE & have the advantage of living with parents post-college to figure things out. When I graduated from college in 2001 and had no job prospects with 2 college degrees, my dad wished me good luck, congratulated me for working hard to finish school & my parents literally drove away leaving me to figure it out on my own. Having to figure out rent, bills, loans on your own without job prospects was scary but I had to figure it out. I don’t blame my parents at all...they started out in America as refugees starting from scratch with nothing & faced racism and roadblocks to be able to build lives, buy a house, working the crappies jobs, raise children & help put us thru college (though we paid for for most of it through our own loans). I started off my first week after college waiting tables, interning for free at two jobs, & steadily climbing up a ladder that I still stumble on...a career in media & comms where I’ve been laid off 3 times at different jobs. Now at 41, I too am faced with unemployment yet again with the pandemic. I say buckle up kids, it’s always going to be a bumpy ride...you aren’t as special as the rest of us who are older & have faced especially rough times. Most of us have already been conditioned that nothing is handed to us, particularly a job in a chosen field of your choice...it’s a privilege to have choices."

But looking back, I don't feel as if I was left behind in pay, opportunities or confidence.  As several noted by several other comments, life goes up and down.  We have had such an unbelievable run over the past decade or more is worth remembering that nothing is certain and that hard work and adaptability are critical skills."

Worked for over 51 years and earned a nice salary to maintain an upper-middle class lifestyle.  Most importantly, my health is good. For those not in the work force today and lacking certain specific skills, life today and life ahead will be a challenge just to cover the needed basics to live. Big business & Wall Street will not answer the bell. Our dysfunctional elected officials in D.C. are concerned with power, money and many with ""important"" religious beliefs that must be turned into laws to benefit themselves.  The disregard of separation of Church and State, lack of FDR type of rebuilding America and the EGO's of the current leadership has doomed 99% of this country. 

How many restaurants will reopen and continue in business one year from now? 30%? Less?  How many gyms? How many nail salons? How many hotels/motels? How many department stores? 

The landscape has changed and will change dramatically until the 1% realize that there are no customers and only essential spending will be taking place.

The bread lines of the Great Depression will be child's play compared to 2020, 2021, 2022 and beyond.

I think it's more the fact that you have to be earning at least $105K a year to be able to buy a home in Seattle, and that's if you can afford to put down 20% on it.  Note also that that's ""home"", not ""house"".  You might be able to get a one-bedroom condo for around $300K in some neighborhoods, but you're certainly not going to find a house anywhere in Seattle for that.

Cities need to invest more in affordable housing in order to retain workers.  Seattle is going to start looking much less attractive to all of our rich tech workers when all of the lower-paid people who provide the amenities they crave decide to throw in the towel and move somewhere where they can afford to lead a life more in line with their expectations."

As a parent and an educator of young adults, it brings out my protective instincts. It makes me mad to hear someone, tell any young person that they may be permanently disadvantaged. In fact it almost seems irresponsible to do so in these dark times when good news is in short supply. How these young people will fair over time, will in some part be up to how our goverment and citizens respond to this time in history. We can make positive difference if we look at student dept and we incorporate them into an pandemic recovery plan. History is full of events that have changed the courses of lives. Why do we always have to paint the worst possible picture for these young people?  Many young people will emerge from this with new and fresh ideas, with clearer ideas of the problems they may want to help to solve. They will learn lessons around perseverence and patience that will serve them well. What happens to us, is not nearly as important as how we respond to them in determining whether we emerge harmed or okay or even better. As Winston Churchill said, ""Never waste a good crisis!"""

It is more likely the opposite since people were dying at home and before testing was widely available.

When we never, ever, EVER seemed to get a ""really good job,"" we blamed ourselves--for not having gone into Wall St. or law or accounting (or, much later, ""tech""), or for just being losers.

2020-05-19 14:58:16,"I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2001 during the dot com bust. The fall before I graduated was awesome. My friends and I were receiving multiple job offers for post-grad. Come June those offers were rescinded and the job prospects were grim. We moved to San Francisco where I was working for free as an intern, many friends worked at Nordstrom department store, and many others struggled to find anything. I know for a fact we were held back both in our careers and salaries. Some of us caught up and others have been stuck in lower paying jobs ever since. I know that the dot com bust made a negative impact in my ability to grow my career as fast or earn as much as my colleagues that graduated 3 years before me or after me. My advice....don't let career rejection get into your head. It's not you, it's just the recession. Keep your head up and your confidence up and you'll get there if you keep trying. This too shall pass."

This was in the mid-2010s. I don't have student loans; however, I will never be able to retire either as I was a stay-at-home mom and was out of the work force for almost 20 years. I know first hand about those graduating during this uncertain job market as my kids are 25 and 23. I feel their plight, but also have mine as well. 

The take away is this: please do not put all of us ""Boomers"" in the same category. Some of us realize the difficult situation that those younger than us are in and believe that there needs to be more money put into the greatest infrastructure this nation has -- its people."
2020-05-19 15:01:27,"As someone who graduated with a mostly useless degree in a deep recession in the late 80's, I was told by my learned professors that my generation would be the first to live substantially worse lives than our parents, that the US was in secular economic decline, that the Japanese would dominate global commerce, that it made sense that the value of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than all the real estate in California. 

I spent my first year renting cars in a ""management trainee program"". I lived in an awful apartment with roommates in an expensive city. It took a few years but I ended up in a great place in life. As did much of my generation. 

Yes, this class has an enormous challenge. You will probably have jobs you consider beneath you for a few years. Competition will be ferocious for few good positions that are open. It will be stressful. However, you are not being asked to storm Omaha beach or fight in Vietnam. Others have faced greater challenges; you can do this."

Most employees are located in Washington, DC, but others are spread throughout the country at different CBP ports.  (Note: CBP doesn’t only work at the ports of entry processing people, it also processes cargo, and is involved in implementing all of the trade agreements.) You might also want to look for job opportunities in trade at the Commerce Department, the ITC (International Trade Commission), and the Treasury Department. There are also many private sector trade groups including trade statistics data firms and Customs brokerage firms who assist customers with either importing or exporting goods.  Good luck to you."

Watching as she searches job listings and knowing that nobody is hiring breaks my heart. And once this all ends and things begin to crawl back to normal, she will have to compete with the next year's college grads for those first-time jobs. I have faith that things will work out, but it sure is hard to watch."
2020-05-19 15:09:07,"I  graduated in 1980, another bust. I had an IT degree during the boom time for that.  I had $10,000 in student loans. I keypunched for the first six months until I could find an entry level position. It paid $15,000 a year. Fast forward 40 years and I have a good job that pays well. Could I be paid more if I had graduated at a different time?  Yes.  The issue is you get a percentage more of your current salary when you change jobs. How about we pay what the job is worth?"
2020-05-19 15:09:35,"I recall seeing several young people in therapy back in the early 90's.  And even then realizing that they were headed for uncertain futures, finding themselves doing jobs which had been held by high school graduates in the past, their college degree little more than a piece of paper and their education not able to get them a better job.

It is a terrible tragedy all the way around.  Young people will never catch up.  And workers in their 50's may be unable to find jobs at the level they'd achieved prior to being let go.

My heart aches for all the pain these folks will be, and already are, facing.  Especially when much of it was not necessary - had Trump acted swiftly to intercept the virus in January.

All the pain Trump has caused this nation.  And the world!  

I simply can't let go of seeing all the carnage....  It breaks my heart!

2020-05-19 15:12:23,"Leaving the vast majority of jobs to the whims of the free market has been a mistake. There's a healthy place for profit-driven business in society, but everything revolves around the bottom line. That's created a relatively short boom and bust cycle that's hardly remedied by a public sector intent on staying out of the way, except when it comes to corporate bailouts.

The most urgently needed jobs aren't necessarily profitable for investors, and will require public effort to create. We need a renewable energy grid. More healthcare workers. More teachers. Habitat restoration efforts to combat CO2 emissions.

There is immense untapped potential in the American workforce, from recession graduates, to people facing age discrimination, and people who want more than creating profit for shareholders.

I'd say the best remedy for our worsening economic polarization, and attendant climate crisis, is a new age of public works. Bring it on"
2020-05-19 15:14:45,"It is time we start encouraging some of our kids to go into the trades and stop this college for all nonsense. I have a daughter who is getting her PhD. She is saddled with student debt because she has never been out of school long enough to pay it off. Yet she drives a new car, eats out regularly, always has a new phone and constantly complains about being broke. Our son on the other hand is a builder he has been learning his trade for 8 years. He has had steady work through this tough time. He has no debt, a healthy savings account and a job he can take anywhere with him. There is a shortage of young people in the trades lets encourage our young people to stop with the student debt and frightening them into thinking college is the only way to a good life. You don’t have to work at fast food restaurant or Walmart if you don’t go to college."
2020-05-19 15:23:33,"Excellent article. And I can relate. Almost a day after college graduation in 1970, a recession arrived — not even as severe as the 2008 version. After graduating near the top of my class, the excitement of a brief and successful job search turned into a 2 year death march. After a few meaningless, unrewarding jobs, I left California to take a job in Denver. 

There was something about launching a career during a recession  that was so dispiriting. Regardless of how much success I brought to our clients, wages remained lower than ever. It was not until I took a job in NYC in 1992 when I felt appreciated for my talent and experience.  Taking the MetroNorth from Westport, Conn. was well worth the commute. 

2008 marked the third recession during my career in marketing communications, each one wiping out savings while working to survive for the recovery. 

I'm retired today and glad I am not reliving the 1970s recession that dragged on into the 1980s. But I feel so much empathy as compassion for those starting their careers, and for those whose careers have been interrupted. 

This may be another signal to high school and college students: You may have a life of careers instead of a career for life. Stay nimble. Develop what I call, ""intellectual osmosis"" by expanding your knowledge of economics, sociology, ecology, politics, psychology ... whatever it takes to land that next job. Be prepared for changes you never expected."
2020-05-19 15:36:09,"Hey tell me about it. I graduated from college in 1979 right into a recession. And then the economy  got worse in the early 80s. Two downturns hit during the bulk of my career and I did hang on to my jobs. But then I got hit again hard - with a lay off - in The Great Recession of 2009. That was effectively the end of my work life. I’ve been an independent contractor-freelancer since and I hate it. I want to WORK. But now I am routinely considered “too old” for almost anything for which I apply. 
Also I watched as my field - newspaper editing and reporting - fell apart and has almost died since the early 1980s. I moved to public relations as I watched the writing on the wall around 1990.
I’ve done what I could. I did what I had to to stay employed and close to my chosen field - writing and editing and communicating - but my entire work life is NOT what I dreamt of or hoped for or wanted to deal with."

2020-05-19 15:44:39,"Another reason that people graduating into a recession get stuck in low-quality, low-pay jobs, and one that this article doesn't really get into, is the perception of employers when it comes to resumes with gaps in employment or minimum wage jobs.  Particularly with college graduates, if a resume shows a long gap or minimum wage job following graduation, employers become wary and this accumulates into an ongoing disadvantage.

Will employers this time around be understanding?  No, this is America the meritocracy, a society that will continue clinging to its exceptionalism and inflated sense of righteousness long after it has become an ineffectual second-rate power, just like post-Soviet Russia.  Americans decades from now will still be blaming China for its woes and the leftward of the two parties and its liberal magazines will still be bashing universal healthcare."

Here's my advice. Things are going to get worse before they get better. You'd better make peace with that reality now. That you have employment related to your desired career at all is victory. That the position pays anything is miraculous. Count your blessings where you can find them."

Things are hard enough already for these young people, and you are piling on the doom and gloom, not only setting them up to expect disappointment in life, but further setting the stage for mental health problems. Where is the balance in this story? I hope you are at least providing balance by publishing stories for this audience on how to manage their situation. I also came out of college during a tough time--and as a journalist, no less. I had to change and adapt. I'm not a millionaire, but I did OK. Maybe there was some luck involved, but a large part of it was looking past the doom and gloom (as did my parents and grandparents during WWII and the Depression), and said I'm going to find a way.  I'm hoping my daughter doesn't see this article."

2020-05-19 16:14:45,"While I fully support young people chasing after their dreams, the cold reality is that many dream gigs are simply vanishing, regardless of the pandemic.  The question I have for Jordan Meier is whether she realized that the field of her choosing, journalism, has been on a rapid decline over the past 15 years.  In the best of times, she would be lucky to get her foot in the door, let alone during a pandemic.  Perhaps a lesson to be learned here for all young people is that it's okay to dream, but you should seriously consider putting Plan B ahead of Plan A.  In other words, get that recession-proof degree in science/engineering/healthcare first and then find your passion (if you haven't already found it)."

Time is on their side. There will be many ways to participate in our society in years to come. This period is unique and young people are making the best of it in all sorts of creative ways: reaching out to friends, spending more time helping their families, reading more and considering their place in the world.

The training to be a reporter is not likely to result in a job.  Was the student misled by her college?  Newspapers are dying everywhere. 

While it might be nice to have a job as a trade consultant, openings can be hard to find. But a well educated person should be able to fill a large number of slots which require intelligence and the ability to learn. That is what a liberal arts education is supposed to enable.

This is a tough time and we all have to reset our expectations - I wish these kids enormous luck and grace.

2020-05-19 16:37:42,"Class of 2009 checking in, feeling solidarity with the Class of 2020. What I learned from the '08-'11 recession: the old rules do not apply. Your life path will look very different from your parents, and as a result their well-meaning advice often isn't relevant. You can always be laid off, loyalty to a company or a way of doing things will not be rewarded.  Home ownership will likely not be a pathway to financial stability for you, and may actually be a millstone around your neck in an economy that requires flexibility.

So what can you do? Stay smart and flexible. Don't define your self worth by your employment -- look for sources of meaning outside of your job.  Save as much as you can, invest some of that in the stock market. You will find a job, but it's going to be hard. There's absolutely no shame in gig work, but don't let yourself get stuck on that path if it's not what you want. Years (yes, it may be years) on the job market in some capacity tests your resolve, but don't let it break you. Take ""breaks"" where you just work your survival job and pause job hunting, but always come back to it.

The idea that the next 70 years are hopeless because of problems in year one cannot factor in the incredible changes these people will see.  People focus on the wrong idea that I can get on the gravy train at 21 and ride it till death. If I miss that one train, I am toast.  No, no, no.  Trains you board at 21, 31, 41, 71 will both be interesting and will derail.  These people can expect ups and downs, celebrations and tragedies.

2020-05-19 16:47:00,"Well, they have years ahead of them to succeed.  The segment of the population which should be a  major concern are the unemployed between 45 and 65.  Even before COVID19, this cohort had not truly recovered from the Great Recession.  Add insult to injury, they were dismissed as dinosaurs and not of any value.  You had to be in your twenties or at the most mid-thirties to participate in the new economy, to play table tennis at work while wearing the clothes you wore the night before, and think that fresh fruit on Fridays was a benefit.  We were not ""digital natives,"" rather ""digiital refugees.""  There will be legions of intelligent, creative people facing continued brutal ageism and permanent unemployment.  They will become the new underclass having lost their homes, savings and any prospect of finding a challenging, productive and worthwhile professional job.  They will be consigned to the minimum-wage retail wasteland.  ""Welcome Walmart Greeter!""

I've heard once too many times, ""you don't fit the culture.""  I'm an intercultural professional with an extensive intersectional proflle!!  Too often I've observed companies, such as Uber, hire the wrong talent and are blind to ""culture.""

A reader (Jimd) noted in his comment, ""There are opportunities you just need a degree that has worth.""  Jim, let me tell you there are scores upon scores of men and women with excellect degrees but unfortunately they graduated university before 1985."
2020-05-19 16:54:45,""" . . . . . Those entering the job market in a downturn may never catch up in pay, opportunities or confidence. . . . . .""

What I would say to the above quote is ""never"" is a long time, particularly for those with 35-45 years of working life ahead of them.

I was born into a small town, lower income class family, my father was unsupportive when I wanted to go to college, I basically started with a bit less than nothing, suffered through the two deep recessions of the early 80's as I was starting out, can remember one two week period when I had $20 for groceries (Campbell's Soup and toast saved the day) and was still struggling month to month in a depressing way when married in my mid-30's. 

But, there's something to be said for being persistent, digging in and working a full time job and a part-time job (like my father) at once while simultaneously taking night classes to upgrade skills to a different profession, then leaping into the unknown.

I retired recently at age 60, a multi-millionaire in excellent health. The last 20 years have been among the happiest of my life. 

I can't know what will happen to all of the young people cited in the story, or the generation in question but the feeling of hopelessness communicated in the story sounded very familiar to me.

I would just say to them: don't accept someone saying ""never"" to you.

""Never"" is a very long time for you."
2020-05-19 16:56:05,"As someone who has experienced acute unemployment and economic insecurity in the past, I can attest that the last thing a working person dealing with those problems needs to hear are concern trolling speculations that the ""damage"" they've incurred is destined to be long-term, or even lifelong. Predictions along that line are neither productive or responsive for someone seeking to improve their situation. When found in the New York Times, they have a way of reading like a hobbyist's view of their ant farm.

This is why I'm part conservative, by the way. Human beings deserve better than to be grouped together to be defined from above and consigned to have their economic futures defined for them en masse, not even as a thought exercise. That sort of indulgence is a luxury of the professional managerial class. 

Working  people- especially independent small business people, whose fortunes are most at risk in the current crisis- deserve be backstopped by a stable safety net. No one should suffer the chronic vulnerability of precarite. But no one needs to have the patronizing opinion that they've been economically crippled forever by a single reversal laid on them, either. If accepting the safety net implicitly requires event a hint of assent to a view like that, many Americans would just as soon go it alone. With a side order of hostility directed toward the tin-eared political stance that most seems to enjoy proffering hand-wringing despair about their future prospects."

Admittedly though, none of the folks in the articles sound like they picked particularly sought after, high paying degrees. Even the gentleman the article opens up with- well, that amount of debt actually is pretty manageable, even as the degree isn't super high paying to begin with. 

I can understand the frustration, and yes, there are structural issues relating to college degrees. But the polarized, generational-divide, identity based picture here is... unhelpful. The article speaks to how this reality is leading to the popularity of far left candidates, but not all of us are burdened with debt or chose low paying degrees. Those of us without debt are becoming increasingly libertarian because bluntly put, why should I pay off your debt when I based my education decisions on finances? I think therein lies a bigger discussion about the future of policy and society, rather than pitting the old against the young with this assumed inevitability of the triumph of the left, galvanized by a disenchanted youth"

Human resources people will need to be more open-minded and flexible, and businesses will need to do more on-job training, but they won't.

The pandemic is a fact that nobody could have adequately predicted or prepared for. It's counterproductive to imply that young people are entitled to any perceived standard of living and that they are victims of circumstances. If you review human history, everyone has been a victim of circumstances -- war, famine, HIV/AIDS, etc - but none of these things can quash the human spirit to rise above circumstances to the best of one's abilities.

I began selling cars, full commission, at the age of 52, after a career in corporate America. By that time, nobody wanted to hire me because of my age. I was almost living in a car by the time I took the job, believing that my education made me too good for the job. Two years later, my income was over six figures.

2020-05-19 13:41:56,"Dear Young People,

I am a millennial and veteran of the 2008 crash. I graduated right into that mess and would like to offer three quick pieces of advice:

1) You will face a chorus of people who, for some reason, will want to lecture you saying “You should have done X, you should have majored in Y, you should move out of Z.” Tune them out. It is just noise. Now, more so than when I graduated, people just want a scapegoat to unload their personal issues onto. 

2) These next few months/years will be hard but you will look back on them as extremely character-building. In the future, you will wonder why your co-workers/bosses whine about even the most trivial little things as you’ve experienced actual adversity. This will toughen you up and make the rest of life more bearable. 

3) In my case, the roundabout route I took towards a “normal” life introduced me to some of my best friends ever and memories I will cherish forever. Though that may be a bit harder for you, don’t discount how experiences like this create opportunities for you to meet the kinds of people you may have never met before had you stayed on the “normal” path. 

Sending you the best of luck and lots of love!"

More than 100 applicants for one job opening. I remember thinking that I'd been fed a line of bull before I even turned 30.  The idea that the unemployed/underemployed are doing something wrong/not working hard enough does us all harm.  There is plenty of work to be done, that's for sure.

I feel bad for college and high school graduates, but they are single and have some options, even if it means moving in with parents.

My advice (from one who was a lifer at my job):  be willing to move to that second or third job quickly. Look as those early positions as places where you can hone KSAs, and  network, network, network. )  I did OK but my biggest mistake was staying on when I did not get my retiring boss's job, that, and not finding a position with a defined pension, which would have likely been with the public sector.  With pensions all but extinct, it's more important that ever to manage your own career.  I was woefully naive in that regard.  Be honest, work hard, avoid office politics but NEVER think that the C suite cares about you. To that end, be ready to jump early and often to make those salary gains.  I more than quintupled my pay over the course of my career with a single employer but was shocked to see one of those industry-peer surveys.  I was probably 50K behind my peers."

Your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month

Saying, 

'they have so much time, they're only 25 years old', or 
'my grandparents had it so just as bad, and they're fine', or
'I graduated into a recession in the 80s and succeeded. All you need is a positive mindset',

Completely misses the point. It's an accurate statistical generalization that postponing entering the workforce is a BAD thing for one's future. Sure, there are outliers, i.e. those that succeed despite diminished opportunity, but in the aggregate, the cohort is worse off. There are fewer opportunities, and in the aggregate fewer people taking advantage of them. It's all relative.

Nobody should give up trying because the statistical reality is bleak. But at the same time, people shouldn't forget that these groups will have be comparatively disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. That is especially true when crafting economic and social political policy."

Past Americans rallied against misfortune and used the vast potential of this country to improve prospects for future generations. If we could put our proclivity for short-sighted thinking on hold, we can do the same.

Our economic problem is a problem of the systems we choose to support rather than a problem of actual scarcity. Rather than seeing downturns a warning sign, wealthier Americans cling even more tightly to a vision of winner-take-all. This attitude is indefensible. How can you enjoy prosperity when you consider what it is like for so many others in this country? Americans of the past contributed a great deal to create a country of opportunity and innovation. It's a crime to chuck all that out the window.

It's unjust and short-sighted to force young people to go without healthcare, and leave them with onerous student loan debt.  If we throw away their future, we also throw away the idea of a vibrant and growing society.

In a few years, we'll have beaten the virus. It would be a travesty to let it lead the nation into permanent decline.

After failing to find a paid internship I settled for low wage office admin and customer service work while continuing to take classes I thought would make me a more competitive candidate to start a ""career"".

After a few years, I realized that I had ""missed the boat"" that many young people take (including many of my classmates) in the years following college.  I realized that the traditional path was not going to work for me.  It sucked, and it was definitely bad timing - I couldn't control that.  However, I could control my thinking about it.  I decided that instead of pitying myself I would take a risk try something radically different, and create my own path.

In 2014 I enlisted in the Army as a combat medic and opened a wide door of opportunities.  I grew a lot as a person and in my work ethic + discipline.  I also earned a ""fresh start"" with the GI bill, allowing me to re-train in something more practical and marketable when I left active duty in early 2019.  

I just finished earning certification as a massage therapist and personal trainer.  Then Covid-19 happened.  It sucks, and it's bad luck.  But I will not allow myself to wallow in self-pity.  I will forge my own path once again.

They did OK, after the end of World War II, but the door to the emerging American middle class was not open for them.  That door had been slammed in their faces 15 years earlier.

Ultimately he became an electrician and supported a family. All his life he wished he he had been able to afford a degree. I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say he was permanently marked by this. Had my dad been part of my generation, baby boomer, I have no doubt he would have gone on to college,graduate school, and a career as an academic.

What I do want is a booming economy - the one like we had before Covid - 19 crashed the party. And I don't mind at all of it includes nonessential businesses. Because as an elder I've come to appreciate that all jobs are ""essential""; and that judging someone else's job as nonessential is the height of snobbishness and conceit.

It was very tough finding employment other than at minimum wage, as employers had plenty of more experienced people to choose from. This time, it will be worse, as unemployment will be much higher, probably 17-18%.

I hope the young, as they cast their ballots in November, will remember how their governors worsened the recession by lockdowns and refusing to allow state economies to restart. Such a generational split between those that benefitted from lockdowns and those that pay the price. 

We baby boomers are most at risk from getting and dying from the virus, whereas the young are at low risk. We also have guaranteed social security, and many of us have stable pensions. Alos, guaranteed medical insurance. What do the young have? Unemployment benefits and no medical insurance."

On the one hand I supported this, because in hindsight college wasn't for me, either. But I did not want to enter the workforce without a degree or a plan B career to fall back on, so I made sure I had a useful BA. I really felt my niece should get a degree and diversify her interests and abilities. She didn't.

She has only pursued her dream to work in a creative, HIGHLY competitive field while refusing to do any other kind of work not in line with her ""dreams"", supported by an endlessly coddling mother. I too, doggedly pursued my dreams at her age, but I worked dozens of hard jobs that I hated along the way. She refuses to do this.

The shutdowns occurred in the very weeks after she graduated from a trade school for her ""dream career"" precisely when she expected she would start taking jobs (which, in even the best of circumstances was going to be a stretch). The industry she was planning to enter has entirely shut down.

I really feel bad for her and I'm worried about her future. But not because of what is happening now. Because of the decisions she's made, and her unwillingness to take any sort of job that she doesn't ""love"".

We are looking at 40+ years of graduates who are behind what their parents made, and the simple reason for this is that their Baby Boomer and Silent Generation parents and grandparents grew up in a time where there was less income inequality, more unions, and generally a better economic picture for the average worker.

Obviously the baby boomer generation and silent generation are going to start dying, but much of their wealth is being burned away on reverse mortgages and long term care expenses, and will end up in the pockets of the 1%.

Major political change is coming, and Gen-X is ill equipped to lead a bunch of dissapointed, underemployed and heavily indebted millennials and Gen Zers. The baby boomers and silent generation have been the thing that saved conservatives at the ballot box, as they have broader wealth and savings than the generations before them, and therefore are willing to support conservative policies that help them. But as they die off, a smaller gen X that has less to lose will not give them the support they need at the ballot box, especially as millennials mature into more reliable voters.

The lucky ones can turn to family resources for support. Most lack this and their challenges can become traumatic and life changing. They lack the life experience and maturity to guide them. The result is loss of confidence and clarity to view horizons in their future from making good little decisions one at a time to build value over time.

Recently I've been tracking some young girls online who don't appear to have ordinary income jobs but are regularly traveling in and out of the country.  Check ins, you know. The impression is they are escorting and the insatiable wolves always have money to pay.  Many of these young girls are from places which invite their youth to leave after high school is done.

Many young girls will make the mental and emotional transition to sex trade jobs. That's a life changer decision. Pole enthusiast, then stripping, which further desensitizes them for the next step of web cam jobs or escorting for those who's preference is working with more efficiency in private space rather than noisy club venues.

Another untold story is the rise of domestic abuse and child abuse, most unreported. Law enforcement blotters tell the story.

But hey, I'm one of the *lucky* ones - better off than my friends whom Boomers sent to die for oil in the desert; whom they've left to get mowed down in the classroom; whom they've watched with indifference as they overdose to death; and better off than the planet which Boomers have polluted and wrecked with their insatiable thirst for more stuff.

It's weird how many commenters seem to think voting Democrat absolves them of everything - as if Bill Clinton and Barack Obama bear no responsibility (oh hey, didn't Democrats control the House through all of Reagan's Presidency?).

The generation that fetishizes ""personal responsibility"" will never take responsibility for the dystopia they've left us with, nor for the disasters they've engineered, nor for continuing to hoard political power as their children and grandchildren are crushed under their heel. No wonder they selected Donald Trump as their President.

If an eligible young voter isn’t ready and willing to vote against them in November there will be much harsher limits and even greater loss to come."
2020-05-19 19:28:22,"The current generation has been spoon -fed.   My grandfather had several young children in 1929.  He like the rest of country was on the verge of starvation for several years.  The family survived at first by picking cotton or doing whatever paid.   When the economy of the country improved, he saved money and started a
a car radiator repair business.  The business thrived, he bought a house and sent both of his sons to war (WWII).  One of those sons earned a Purple Heart.  My grandfather was not an educated man- just 3 years of formal education.   Young people today are spoiled, entitled and coddled.  They need to grow up,  face the world and learn how to live with it.  They need to learn how to fend  for themselves."
2020-05-19 19:28:58,"While I know that everything is terrible right now (sigh), I am certain that the only constant is change.

I refuse to believe that my 17 year old daughter's life is permanently diminished, because then there's no reason to look for solutions or to feel hope. Yes, things are rough. They will likely get worse before they get better. But it's awfully difficult to see what will happen in a year, let alone a decade or two.

I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. I knew with that diagnosis that my life would never be the same again, and this is true: I am covered in scars, my life forever altered by my experiences and side effects. But in 2005 I could not have predicted the joys that would come with my recovery, my own resiliency, the strengthened friendships, and my own increased sense of purpose, strength, and joy in the mundane as well as extraordinary parts of living. In 2005, it seemed reasonable for me to believe that joy was in my past, that my life would forever be one of pain, maiming, sorrow. Sometimes, it's true, that cancer kills. But it is equally true that what doesn't kill you CAN make you stronger. I am stronger now than ever before, and I hope that my daughter's generation, while fighting their own ""cancer"" is also able to find ways to emerge from this, bearing scars but filled with joy and purpose, creating their own paths.

The future is yet unseen. I will fight for hope."

As new generations prefer getting their news from tweets and instagram posts, there will be far fewer jobs for fledgling reporters. This has nothing to do with Coronavirus.

Interesting, but none of the students profiled here appear to have had STEM concentrations--engineering, computer science, bioinformatics, etc. While ideally college should allow students to simply explore and expand their critical thinking skills, that may not be the best route for many in the 21st century economy, even before the pandemic. If getting a secure job with a future is an important consideration, preparing yourself to be where those jobs actually are seems like a good strategy."

2020-05-19 19:38:12,"While this article reflects the dilemmas facing our three grown children, it fails to address the employment crises facing many workers in their 50 and early 60s. My husband has been through 5 layoffs since 2008. Each lay-off has cost us more of our retirement savings, and three moves to different cities. My husband turns 60 this November and he lost his job in energy management in april - with no relief in sight. At least the younger generation has time on their side. Please write about this!"
2020-05-19 19:38:47,"How did this article get written without one word about climate change and the economics the youngest generations will be facing as environmental disasters increasingly rage around us?  Sanders got it 100% right.  Transitioning off of fossil fuels and building a new society around sustainable energy sources is the future and needs to start immediately.  There are millions of jobs if we just had the will to get off of fossil fuels.

I have no sympathy for the older generations, of which I am one.  The older generations are the obstacle to transitioning off of oil and gas.  While the young cried out for our help in saving their future lives, we watched silently as the U.S. produced more oil and gas last year than in any other previous year.  Selfish, greedy, extravagant – the older generation impedes a desperately needed change."

I could not get a ""real"" job at first so I took on a slew of crappy ones -- bartender at a bar more like Mo's from the Simpsons than Cheers, temping, waitress at a local diner, even briefly sold water softeners door to door. I applied for dozens of jobs (the old way, with hand-typed snail-mailed letters) and still have a box full of rejections. My favorite: the letter from a Philadelphia hospital saying how much they enjoyed meeting me and that I had great skills but wasn't quite what they were looking for. Problem is it arrived a few hours before the interview was scheduled to take place. (I went anyway; when asked if I had any questions, I placed the letter on the hiring team's conference table. Silence and red faces all around. That almost made the rejection worthwhile.)

So...breathe deep, grab any job you can find that pays the bills and don't give up. This too shall pass. You never know what might happen. On those depressing nights at that skeevy suburban bar, I never thought that one day I really would get my fantasy job in Europe. 

Don't let Covid-19 kill your dreams at such a young age."
2020-05-19 18:57:33,"Every generation since the war has faced its own challenges and so what? But, the difficulty today's young people face is qualitatively different from graduating into a war (Vietnam), the recession of the early 1970s, the inflation-distorted economy of the 1980s or the so-called Great Recession.

It is a qualitative difference because young people today will start-out in the first elective recession in the nation's history. The economy was booming and then wobbly medical fortune-telling and arrogant governors (especially in the blue states) elected to close their economies and let everything go to Hades.

We don't have 2,000,000 dead and the covid deaths are overwhelmingly among the elderly who already were facing end-of-life. So, in a panic, we screwed-over the futures of tens of millions of young people when better eldercare was about all that was needed.

Our bad!"
2020-05-19 19:36:41,"This November, I hope every young person profiled in or reading this article holds the person responsible for the staggeringly inept mishandling of the pandemic that made this economy and their career prospects so much bleaker.

Many of us are not wealthy or even financially secure and, of course, we're concerned about social security and medicare.  Having said this, I care very much about what happens to a debt-strapped younger generation.

2020-05-19 20:19:33,"I graduated May 1st from a top university with plans to study at graduate school in September, and I'm in the same boat as many of these students. Grad school is a saving grace, but it requires me to be able to pay for it and pay for rent in the city nearby. Gotta say though, this article was anything but comforting. The reason we're all becoming socialists is that it seems like the only solution. You've given me this article about how bad things are, but what are my options other than ""deal with it"" and ""work in a high risk job""? 

Look, I get it. Everyone is out for themselves right now. There's millions unemployed, people aren't worried about ""kids"" in their early twenties who don't have much at risk and can easily move back home with their parents when the university terminates their housing with little notice And I'll do the ""American Way"" of pulling myself up by my bootstraps, settling with the job I get that might not help me in the future. 

But let me tell you. I'm frustrated with the rhetoric applied to younger generations saying that ""we're lazy"", ""we don't care about others"", we're ""just like any other generation and they got through it so we can too"".  The empathy, perseverance and strength you're asking me to have could have been used by another generation to make it so I don't have to do all this. How am I, a 21 year old who wasn't old enough to vote in the 2016 election, supposed to deal with this future I've been given but that I had no hand in choosing?"
2020-05-19 20:24:39,"Uh... no.. sorry... but while I empathize with the panic this can cause in young adults..... most of us older folks have ""been there, done that.

I remember graduating from college in 1975 looking directly into the face of a huge recession, and literally no jobs to be had for young college graduates.  No prospect of income, much less owning a home or buying a new car, etc. etc.

My point:  the triggering event here is new, but the outcomes in the employment market are NOT new."
2020-05-19 20:24:50,"The more stories that tell younger people that they have been dealt a bad hand through no fault of their own and they will never come out of it, the more they will adopt this way of thinking and do nothing to pull themselves out it. They will expect that others fix the problem while they sit and wait. 

If your house burned to the ground through no fault of your own, you can stand on the ashes and say ""Woe is me,"" or you can pick up the pieces the best you can and move on. 

Articles like this just encourage people to stand on the ashes crying and expecting that others will come and rebuild the house for free and the ""victim"" not having to lift a finger.

If the young people have it so bad: student debt, lousy pay, difficult times all around, then mobilize and vote for people who will pave the way for a better future. There are millions and millions of young people who can upturn an election by their sheer numbers but many are apathetic or too self centered to think about the country's problems as a whole. They simply want for themselves and don't give thought to anyone else."

All this was already happening, slowly, for decades.  The virus is now Generation Greed's excuse.

Next they'll be saying that as a result of the coronavirus, a higher share of today's young adults have already grown up in broken homes."
2020-05-19 20:33:02,This is the luck of the draw.  It is not the first generation to face daunting obstacles.  You'll find more stories of people starting with next to nothing and ending up with a comfortable life.  You'll find a few that hit it big and a few that lose it all.  If there is one thing I hope this generation of graduates takes to heart is the notion that you don't do it alone.  People will help you along the way.  As a society we move forward together.  We fall back when we splinter.  The confederation of dunces that brought us this calamity will not be in office for the recovery stage if we set aside the differences and vote them out.

These supposedly little nothings build up over time, and the victims never quite understand why.

My ex-boss even recommended the odious ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" that 1998 mass layoff corporate go-to, as he still believes in the analogy of workers as harried scurrying rodents huffing cheese dust as they race desperately through a maze reading insipid propaganda. My hope for the young is that they find a better way than I did, that they see through the manipulations and stay out of the maze."

If you do lose your confidence over this virus and its effects, then, yes, you will be defeated. If you allow youself to be scarred because the economic cycles do not favor you, then you have no acquaintance with fortuna, and you should ask for your tuition money back. 

You have the greatest wealth of all--your life, for one, and, from an economic point of view, human capital, something your elders can never regain. I'm serious: education today, especially in colleges, infantilizes people. Toughen up. Don't be weak and over-sensitive. Don't expect what is historically rare. Be as self-reliant as you can be and then as generous as possible. Create. Take risks. Persevere. Act courageously. Life is a miracle, but not if you don't rise to meet it."

Our government should have an immigration policy that supports sourcing workers from our population and our educational system. In contrast to stimulus checks, it costs next to nothing for the U.S. government to stop issuing foreign worker visas.

Many people - of all ages - go back to school to learn a new skill which will make them extremely employable --

Here are a few suggestions for the young Mr. Henderson and some of his fellow students --

You can go back to school and lean how to --

Repair refrigerators and air conditioners -

Learn plumbing - then work as an apprentice - obtain a license and join the union - on your way to a job which is very high-paying -- just ask anyone who has had to hire a plumber --

Get a job in retail - work hard - and progress up the ladder to district manager - or even a corporate director --

Go back to school and study nursing - you will be without a job as a nurse - or perhaps medical billing -- there's a major for that -

...

There was a time when I was struggling - no real job - seemingly without a direction in my life - unhappy and feeling a bit like the victim of circumstance --

Then one day - a friend of mine told me something which was very hard for me to hear at that time -- but which I have never forgotten -

He said -- ""Losers do what they want to do - winners do what they have to do"" ..."

Which is why the best and the brightest vied for jobs at Goldman Sachs.  Ironically, many did so after talking a great game about social justice and progress in their elite universities.  Most other young people were facing an uphill battle as middle class stability was disappearing.  Those entering the market now can basically join the club."

2020-05-19 20:50:03,"Clicking on the writers' names, I see Mr. Porter has the longer (and interesting) professional background, and I infer he must know more than a bit about the value of initiative.  Mr. Yaffe-Bellamy's reported work background reflects rather less experience, going back to the summer of 2018, but enviably a degree from Yale University.

I recall finishing my undergraduate degree in 1975, which was a little before the end of a 2-year recession, and I recall very well there was plenty of discouragement to go around at the time.  The most discouraged were those whose total job search plan was to be handed a job based on an on-campus interview. 

""You can't succeed"" wisdom, such as, ""Saddled with debt, and entering a job market devastated by the pandemic, he and millions of his contemporaries face an exceptionally dicey future,"" impresses me as the opposite of what young job seekers need to hear.

There is always some level of churn in the workforce.  E.g., people retire, people quit because of personality and/or personal issues, people leave one job for a better one, etc.  Everyone has a different story about how their career started, changed in midstream by choice or unexpectedly, etc., and few of these stories start with, ""I heard you can't succeed ..."".

It shouldn't be that hard to drum up some wisdom for young people that would be more helpful than the anecdotes in this article."

Our country threw the lives of 50,000 young people away on the trash heap of history for nothing, countless more bodies came home damaged, all for nothing (other than corporate greed), and even millions who didn't have to go to Vietnam had their youth stolen away from them by their government as they waited for the draft, which ended so many young careers, and caused so many to drop out.

However, some of us made it. And I'd pick Covid19 over Vietnam (or Afghanistan or Iraq) any day! At least Covid 19 is fair and not driven by corruption (other than the Trump administration's incompetence and corruption; however, LBJ was almost as corrupt and incompetent as Trump)."

If you like fun and less security choose media, communications, graphic design, fashion, music, journalism.  The job market is supply and demand and always has been."
2020-05-19 20:54:54,"Every generation faces economic downturns. In my case having graduated college in 1973, the job market was not good at all. Then the Jimmy Carter years followed in the late 70's, with hyper inflation, wage stagnation, the Arab oil embargo, and severe gas and oil shortages. The economy rebounded under the leadership of the greatest American president in terms economy prosperity and growth, Ronald Reagan. Sure it's tough for the college class of 2020, but this economy is already poised for a major bounce back, no matter what the lifelong pessimists who write for The Times would have you believe. Their job is to trash America and capitalism, and to pander to the doom and gloom left who see the sky falling every single day."
2020-05-19 20:56:40,"Every generation has their problems I had to deal with mine when I got out of college in 2005, they’ll have to deal with theirs, I find this current generation, the millennials, to be quite whiny and ineffective."
2020-05-19 20:56:50,"I graduated into a lousy economy, and pretty much the only place I could get a job was in Houston.  I expected to hate it, but to my surprise it was OK.  The career was a terrible fit, but the wife I met there was a wonderful one.  I have ended up doing something very different, and less remunerative than I expected 40 years ago, and I'm happy.  Happiness and income are related, but not the same.

Life unfolds differently than you expect.  Sometimes what seems terrible at the time is not so in the long run.  Sometimes what you thought you wanted comes to seem foolish to an older version of yourself.  

I do not mean to minimize these young peoples' pain and anxiety.  But I can tell you that life will probably be very different than you expected as a college graduate, and that's often for the better."
2020-05-19 21:18:21,"Ms. Haggard says, “I know I will never be able to afford a home in Seattle or even live by myself without a roommate or two.” 

Then she’s choosing to give up home ownership because she prioritizes living in her preferred and extremely expensive location.

She could have gone the other way: prioritizing home ownership and choosing to live in a place less expensive than Seattle. 

We all accept trade-offs. We can’t have every single thing we want, and that’s true even in boom times."
2020-05-19 21:22:39,"It may be necessary to abandon some dreams of careers in fields that are overloaded with applicants competing for too few jobs.  If a person is intelligent, success can be attained in almost any field. In my opinion, there ought to be more focus on  traditional trades such as electrical, plumbing auto repair etc. The individual that combines good business acumen with the skills of a trade can make a very good and financially successful life for themselves. Heaven knows we've got enough lawyers. Here on the islands, a good mechanic is much more valuable than that."
2020-05-19 21:29:34,"Work the jobs you can; hopefully most of them will be fun, or around fun people so you can laugh while you toil. 

In my life, I've been a Birkenstock repairman, car stereo installer, home theater installer, art gallery owner, web production artist, creative writing instructor, art director at a university, and now an owner of an advertising firm.

I graduated from UCSB with a degree in Literature. And that degree actually helped me in all of my jobs, since I could communicate intelligently with clients and my employers, so I was always the prized employee that could be client-facing. Being personable and articulate will get you closer to that fabled brass ring.

Now I'm 50, and am wondering if my ad firm will be around next year, so, once again, I'm looking for another backup plan. Ageism will also mean that I need to find a new angle for another biz; I already own the hardware and software, so why not use it to make a living for myself, and not other clients?

Unfortunately this is the new way of life, and you just have to be adaptable. Lots of people need to be jacks of all trades today; the days of company lifers and pensions are dust in the wind."

2020-05-19 21:35:08,"I feel for these young people, but their youth is an asset. They will recover, and one of the ways they speed that process up is to vote. Don't sit out elections, even if you have to vote for incremental change (hint: Biden is a change in the right direction away from Trumpism and the GOP)."
2020-05-19 21:35:10,"It will be difficult, but there are ways to mitigate the damages.  I know it's taboo in a left leaning publication, but  joining the military is an option.  Contrary to popular belief, the majority of service people don't fire a weapon in battle.  Some don't have to fire a weapon at all, not even in training(Navy, Coast Guard, unless of course that is purposely sought out). Most services have just about every civilian job you can think of from news reporter to law, to supply.  Another trade can be learned on the government's dime, and for active duty and some reserve/guard components, there are generous tuition repayment programs.  After 4 years active duty, maybe the economy has recovered, but one would ideally have a new/bolstered skills, life experience, tuition relief, and ready to hit the civilian market full steam ahead.

Military life isn't for everyone, so junior/community colleges are a good option to learn a trade.  My trade has done more fore me than my college degree, by far.  Yes it isn't free, but it's about a close to free as you can get for a quality education.  of course, learning a trade after obtaining a degree is a tough pill to swallow, but these times require thinking outside the box.  Over the long run, I think retooling skillsets will benefit more so than trying to ride it out in Mom's basement."
2020-05-19 21:36:51,"Matthew Henderson, my advice would be to not only consider a job at costco, or target, or ANYWHERE that's hiring... So you can begin to chip away at your debt. If your parents are able to house you then you should stay. This is reality, take whatever you can get to try and make a living. College degrees stopped delivering years ago, and you'll find that applying to Costco will be extremely competitive right now. The results you'll find are extremely grim moving forward... Be flexible and fluid in your dreams, and be ready to toss your prospects of what you thought you'd be doing for something available. There are no guarantees, and there never have been. With any luck, ten years from now you might have a deeper understanding of humility, and hopefully a job that you can stomach. ""Dream jobs"" are only visible through reality tv shows in this world, but it doesn't mean you can't live out your dreams... They just may need to change. One thing you can do again and again, and yet again to try and change this current reality.... Is vote. Until then, come and join the ranks of so many that are working a job we didn't ""plan on"" for healthcare. This is coming from a millennial with a college degree, debts paid off until I return to school for yet another degree soon(at 35!), years of sacrifices and pain.... But also immense joy. Keep the faith that if you stay flexible, open, and grateful for the little things, you'll get what you ""need"" out of this life. Good luck man."
2020-05-19 21:39:48,"Our kid decided to start this year at a Community College, and then transfer his credits via an established articulation agreement to one our State University system schools.  Even he saw, with very little prodding from us, that going into a many thousand dollar student loan debt situation is a no win in the long term.  As a result, we'll be able to help him graduate with no loans.  I'm not sure why more kids don't consider the CC path toward 4 year degree.  As a former hiring manager at a major firm, I can guarantee you that we never looked down on a student whose transcript included a CC component.  In fact, I found over the years that young employees not burdened by the student debt albatross are more easy going and less stresssed day to day on the job."
2020-05-19 21:29:27,"Stop it with the stories people.  No recent grad wants to hear how you slummed it washing dishes for 2 years until you found a job that sprung your career.  Those jobs are gone now because of Covid 19.  They may never come back in some places.

And when the economy does recover, all the recent grads with the recent skills will get the entry level jobs and this year's grads will be left behind even further.  I saw it all in 2008-2012.  Those grads are still trying to pull ahead.

It's time for the older generation to stop trying to feed us with stories and start working for their kids future.  You benefited from a 40 hour work week that was negotiated by unions that you systematically have disassembled.  You had college tuition rates thousands of dollars less than they are today.  Healthcare costs were 500% less 50 years ago.  Home prices too.  How much debt did you start your dishwashing career with? Was it the average of $32,731 that is is today? What was the rent of your ""cheap apartment"", was it $1,078 a month for a one bedroom like it is now?

So are you going to lift up this generation like your parents did for you? Or are you going to let them ""pull themselves up"" with none of the benefits that you had."

2020-05-19 21:42:05,"I suggested recently (last week or the week before) that Congress should look to expand Social Security to persons over 55 so that the younger generations will have more opportunities.

This will help both the younger and older people who will be impacted long term from the financial impacts of the economy shutting down due to  COVID-19 virus.


If Democrats want to make an impact, adding an expansion to Social Security would be backed by many."
2020-05-19 21:42:50,"My parents graduated in the midst of the Great Depression & then the generation got shipped off to war.  Nothing compares to that.  I sought  my first job at the same time my father lost his in 1975.  I had to shift gears and instead of teaching (not really my calling) I started at an entry level position in the investment business while I got an MBA.  Then I made the  “stellar” career move of leaving my job to finish the MBA full time. Youth is so wasted on the young!  I got caught in a couple of layoffs as well throughout the years.  My youngest son graduated in 2008 and never had a problem getting a job.  He also carried very little debt even while pursuing two master degrees.  Another son took on virtually no debt through 2 masters and a PhD.  They both changed directions a couple of times and most likely will again ..... as this time they could be laid off.  They have saved and invested wisely; living below their means (Mom’s lessons took!)

Bottom line, there are always  “bad” times.  Those who have it together, readjust and go forward with different and new opportunities.  Those who took on crushing debt got really bad guidance and advice.  I put that on the combination of parents, schools, predatory lending programs, and the students themselves.  

There are always choices and this generation is faced with no more or less than any other generation.  Get a grip and figure it out.  Sacrifices need to be made and instant gratification is not where it is at!"
2020-05-19 21:43:42,"The US needs a ""we culture"" not an ""I"" culture.  During my work travels I have met many from other cultures who explain their country's collective approach to social problems.  The US does not have a unified we culture.

We have the self-made, up from the bootstraps myth even though the US economy was built on the backs of Native Americans, slavery, women and children. 

Here we are with substandard healthcare, crumbling infrastructure, poor schools except for a very rarefied elite.  Now that our corrupt lobbyist dominated culture is affecting our most promising youth and with COVID exposing the US as far from exceptional, maybe there will be a reset.  Though doubtful until people are willing to face up to uncomfortable truths.  Surely Steve Mnuchin and Jared have some ideas for these graduates.

2020-05-19 21:44:36,"It's a little early to be predicting the long-term economic effects of the pandemic, especially without a historical precedent to study.  Young people should keep their heads up and search for better opportunities if they are unhappy with their current jobs.  They can find something better than an internship that pays just $250 a month.  We really don't know how long the current slowdown will last, and how many people will really lose jobs permanently instead of just enduring a temporary furlough."
2020-05-19 21:47:33,"Could this possibly be true, that the current combined disaster of a coronavirus pandemia and the abuse of power of a self-service gluton in-chief may determine a poverty of choices for the foreseeable future? If that were the case, it may be urgent to move to another country were advancing socially and economically is still possible. But this seems a very depressing view of our potential. We were never offered a 'rose garden' where success can be taken for granted; instead, our problems are call for to find smart solutions...if we ever get a chance to be educated in freedom and justice, and feel part of society at large...and demand an end to the current odious economic inequality, so a true democracy may see daylight. For that, we must become active in our own destiny by participating, and contributing, so social justice opens up for you and me and everybody else. What may be happening is that we feel, individually, isolated and powerless...but this ought not be a permanent feature were the only thing that is unchanging is change itself. So, let's keep our eyes open, our ears on attention, and seek a coordinated effort in improving society by our involvement. Worthwhile problems are made so we can solve them."
2020-05-19 21:52:49,"As someone who graduated into the Great Recession and just--as of last year--got my first full-time job with benefits that pays an actual living wage, I'm a little less concerned about the recent grads than about everyone in my age group.  We veterans of the Great Recession are now looking at potentially losing our hard-won gains, and I fear that if we tumble off the ladder we've so strenuously tried to climb over the past decade, we'll never get back onto it.  It took me ten years to reach the middle class, at least by salary.  I'm terrified of falling back out of it.  

Employers will look at the class of 2020 a few years from now and understand why their resumes are spotty.  The whole world has been affected by COVID-19 in a way that wasn't true of the Great Recession; even those of us who are financially stable at the moment will bear psychic scars from the experience.  Those of us who already have unusual resumes due to everything we had to do to survive the Great Recession will be at a far greater disadvantage should another period of sustained unemployment befall us."
2020-05-19 21:54:23,"I feel badly for all the people (of any age group) suddenly out of work or not able to find a job. It’s even more debilitating for those who have experienced two severe economic downturns in just 12 years. And of course we live in a country with an inadequate social safety net. The programs we do have are due almost entirely to Democratic efforts. 

I hope the economy will recover soon with close attention to avoiding unnecessary deaths. Our Republican governor In MA (Charlie Baker) is taking a science-based approach to reopening. That is smart. 

But I also hope many people begin to realize that the causes for these needless economic disasters are rooted in poor policies and a lack of foresight. They were put in place by mostly conservative and populist politicians. 

We can have different outcomes if we are smart enough to learn from this mistaken allegiance to a politics based on resentment."

But, Governor Pritzker's wife and family can go to Florida and Wisconsin, while the little people are out of work.  The Democrat mayor of Chicago can get her haircut because ""I take my personal hygiene very seriously"".  Pardon me while I go wallow around in the hog slop.  Typical liberal ""what's good enough for thee isn't good enough for me.""  We need to open up the economy now!

Dr. Michael Burry has a financial reading list which should be essential reading for all, especially value investors (which I am).  <a href=""https://www.valuewalk.com/michael-burry-recommended-reading-list"" target=""_blank"">https://www.valuewalk.com/michael-burry-recommended-reading-list</a>/

I also recommend joining stocktwits, for those new to trading and investing. 

There may be few formal opportunities for employment in the future. Many restaurants will be permanently closed. 

The stock market will always be open. If one simply understands one concept, ""Margin of Safety"", one can with a little luck, easily make money in the stock market. 

I have turned the $1,200 stimulus check into $10,000 in a mere matter of weeks with some savvy and well-timed call options.

Self-employment is the future. One must know how to successfully trade stocks and be a lifetime learner. 

If one knows how to manage downside risk while successfully trading stocks, one will never go broke, one will never go hungry, and one will always have money in the bank."

2020-05-19 23:23:01,"So many thoughts from this piece. 

1. It is unsurprising that Boomers are increasingly resistant to anything they see as income redistribution. Unfortunately, there's this zero-sum attitude that anything going to younger populations means something is taken away from them. A lot of Boomers are still workers, unlike previous generations that were much more likely to have saved more and retired promptly at 65. 

2. As a Millennial myself, I graduated college in 2007. I was lucky to get a job out of school (2007 was still pretty good), but got laid off in Feb 2009. I fit the pattern of languishing for a few years in underpaying jobs, honestly until 2014. So five prime earning years were essentially lost. Now some of that was personal mistakes and growth, but it's hard to gain a foothold in an industry that was shaken to its core. I'm currently in a good place, but don't have the cushion to go very long if I lose my job. So, on an anecdotal level the research makes absolute sense. I feel truly awful for those trying to enter the job market now. 

3. Like a lot of Millennials, I grew up pretty comfortable in a reliably Republican suburban bubble. Being in the ""real-world"" and seeing the sheer inequity across our economic system, it's made me a reliable liberal voter. Even prior to COVID, my parents moved from solidly red to purple, and are now going to campaign for Biden. I think there's a lot of people for whom the economy isn't working and we need big, not cosmetic changes."

2020-05-19 23:37:13,"This article, while appreciated, but falls so far short of doing justice to the issue it almost warrants being dismissed as pure pollyannism, however bleak people think it to be.

What many of these kids are in for is a series of assaults on their dignity, their mental health, their intellectual-cognitive function, their basic identities, their wallets, their relationships, their physical health, marriage possibilities, & any & all aspects of a happy or fulfilling life.

Many, particularly those with parental resources cushioning them against the recession, can ride it out in education programs, an internship, or some other bridge-refuge.

But those caught in the recession's teeth without protection, will face conditions comparable the the Joads in ""Grapes of Wrath."" I did, graduating from a prestigious college in the 1990-1991 recession. 

Life becomes a desperate struggle for survival, not unlike in the recent film ""Parasite,"" or the classic ""Bicycle Thieves."" For each advertised position, hundreds apply. Those who just months earlier were reading Thucydides in original Greek will compete for minimum wage, mind-deadening jobs  like concentration camp inmates over a scrap of bread (or more specifically, work detail rather than its alternative. ""The strong do what they can, the weak suffer what they must.""

2020-05-19 23:43:45,"I feel bad for people in this position, but it has been made worse by policy decisions of local and state governments.

Nationwide, students are in more debt than two decades ago from attending public universities because of several factors.

1.  The ever increasing cost of healthcare and the increasing costs of Medicaid on the state budgets.  These costs are largely driven by tobacco use and obesity from poor diets/overeating/lack of moderate exercise.  1/9 of food stamps is used for Coke/Gatorade drinks, 1/9 for junk food.

2.  In some states, notably, NY, CA, and Illinois, there are overly generous pension where public employees retire at younger ages than the private sector and get very large pensions.  This costs the state budget money.

3.  In some states such as NYS, there are large number of illegal residents.  NYS uses state funds to pay for healthcare at our public hospitals and community health centers.  By law the state and local governments are *required* to pay for K-12 education for children living here illegally.

These three issues take state money away from higher education making the students and their patients having to pay more to effectively subsidize these functions.

In addition, we have many people here on H1-B Visas (for STEM jobs) that should not be renewed so that Americans can have those jobs, yet many seem to complain insisting that H1-B Visas be extended and that Americans should be lower priority than H1-B for jobs."

2020-05-19 23:44:29,"Graduated in 2013 with a degree that had a reputation (for years) of being a quick passport to unemployment. I was told many times with words and looks that it was not a good idea but i still went ahead. That dream build up for years to a point that ""it's the only thing i see myself doing"".

After graduating, 5 years went by, had all sorts of low paid jobs, informal, under the table, temporary, unrewarding. 

Being 17 and 'i can do whatever i want if study hard' to an unemployed-no expectations young adult was incredibly tough.

Time went by, had zero experience, zero professional skills, almost no confidence and no hope.

Took a random job (not on my workfield) with the same apathy and low expectations i had for my previous jobs and discovered something unexpectedly good. Most importantly it allowed me to come to the surface and breathe!

All this has taught me pragmatism (i'm also 14 years older!), gratitude and how important is to make practical and smart choices.

My degree is worthless but those years shaped an important part of who i am today and how i manage expectations.

When I approached the farmer, he simply shook his head --him and fellow farmers had been overwhelmed by university graduates asking to pick fruit (with apologies, he turned me away).

Fast forward a decade --I'm still making minimum wage, I have two roommates, zero savings, and home ownership a distant unimaginable. 

Putting on pants every morning and going into work is a political act --it means today I'll be contributing to this system. But why do I even bother participating in this current system, when the companies I work for make record profits while I starve?

I didn't major in biology because it was a great way to get a job.  I loved science.  What I have since learned is that whenever industry claims to need certain types of training it's lying.  They want to keep the number of job seekers high so they can underpay.  18 years later I had to leave a field I loved because no employer wanted to pay me for my experience.  I started over in IT at the bottom of the salary ladder.  20 years later I found myself in the same situation again.  

Like many who came of age in bad economic times I have never made up the lost ground.  I have lived through at least 2 bouts of extended unemployment.  I have watched friends and colleagues and neighbors struggle to find jobs even though they had held good jobs before losing a job.  Lives have been destroyed because America has no social safety net and no interest in developing one.  It's every person for him/her self and if you can't make it, too bad.  There's always the street to die on.  

And yet, there's plenty of work that needs to be done.  Trump promised an infrastructure project.  Haven't seen it.  He promised us a better health care system.  Nowhere in sight.  He has given the store away to the richest.  He has driven from government service some of our best and brightest.

Suffice to say, I went to Medical School after facing a weak recession job market.  Nearly all my money now goes towards student loans in my early thirties, $70000 of which is interest accrued during Medical School and residency.  Even with my Attending salary, they aren’t going to be paid off soon.  It wasn’t like I splurged.  I graduated Undergrad with no student debt, having worked >30 hours a week while a full time undergraduate.  I drive a car with 270,000 miles on it, a 2003 Honda Pilot.  Lived with over 14 roommates in my time since high school.  I just didn’t have family help, like some of my peers. 

The effects of the last recession are still felt by my age group, even those highly educated. Few of us have children, as compared to our parents.  Few of us own houses.   None I know are in a pension system, and those who do have retirement plans have ones tied to the swinging stock market. 

Like Ms. Haggard, I too identified as a Republican when I was young and naive, pre-Recession.  Never again.  I come from a family who identify as Republicans; even though if you ask their positions on issues, they are very liberal, but that is another story.

I met my partner while doing non-typical college grad work in 2010, it caught her attention, and we've been happily married for eight years. 

Avoid large metro areas.  They'll eat up all your $ with high costs of living.  Small and mid-sized metro's are overlooked and offer great opportunities if you root, network, and work at job mobility.  

Never stop learning (not talking about taking coding or management classes in 3-5 years).  Learn trades on the side and you have a plan B.  I'm a public health data analyst and I got certified as an EMT last year for free through work.  I don't do it daily, it's not my passion, but it's a backup plan if I'm laid off tomorrow.  

Buy a cheap house on the outskirts (or GASP--in a rural area and enjoy podcasts during your commute) and fix it up yourself.  Learn to grow food, cook, raise chickens, and get to know and take care of yourself in the meantime.  There won't be hours a day for Netflix if you take this path but you'll have the priceless assets of peace of mind and security when the next bump comes along."

People kept working at whatever jobs they could find with little expectation that any politician on the left or right would help them. With the Republicans young people at least knew what they were getting unlike with the Democrats who did a bait and switch. Sadly the situation remains the same offering little hope to young disaffected generations."
2020-05-20 00:50:47,"The biggest issue no one talks about  is the educational industrial complex. In most instances( excluding STEM )a college degree is not needed. Yet many younger non STEM adults are encouraged to go to college when they would probably be better off going to a trade school instead.  Surprisingly many don't understand that the more people who go to college, the more competitive it becomes when they apply for jobs. 

What the market needs to do is to encourage students to not be sheep's and to find a career that suits works best with their attributes. This can going to trade school or have a HS course to have them learn about entrepreneurship.

Just my two cents"

2020-05-20 00:54:34,"Putting the emphasis on the epidemic-driven downturn overlooks how dysfunctional the US economy was already.

They will figure it out. It will take time. Maybe 5 years from now this will all be history. Maybe 5 years from now, our economic landscape will be permanently altered. Who knows. Bottom line, I don't feel much for Generation Z woes or Millennial woes. People in all generations face their economic problems."

2020-05-20 01:08:28,"Covid 19 has made the situation for recent graduates definitely worse, but it did not start with the virus economic threat.
Already for years newly graduate students have run into a troubled economy.
Despite the stock market records, there were very few jobs for new entrants in the economy, especially college and graduates with a new Phd degree.
Because of the endless outsourcing by corporations large and small, many of the jobs suited for newly graduates have left the country and are now done with cheap educated labor in mostly South East Asia, working alongside even cheaper manual outsourced labor.
Corporations don’t care about nations, definitely not about their own nations, they only care about themselves and their wealth.
They are the fox in their own chicken coops, eating them and spitting them out.
They feel like they run their country and in fact they do, being supported by the present government as well as earlier governments.
They have the politicians in their pocket with their large donations and with their input in the creating and wording of new laws that will only favor them.
It is the American ‘feudal’ style of capitalism, geared to increase inequality and to destroy democracy.
There is not much time left for America to change directions before it will fully self destruct."
2020-05-20 01:09:20,"These young people don't need inspirational tips or life coaching. They, and the future of this country, need a sensible system of social safety nets that just about every other first world country has. We had stagnant wages and low economic mobility even before the epidemic. That means the problem is not uninspired young people. That's a sign we have a systemic problem."
2020-05-20 01:14:34,"Young workers who know how to jobhunt and interview will do just fine in this economy. The people who will suffer are the ""boomlet"" - those not old enough to retire but old enough to be downsized in layoffs. This group also faced discrimination - racial, gender, disability - early in their careers because the legal protections weren't there. 

My response, as a member of the latter group, is to share what I know by mentoring the younger group. Indeed, most of the jobs listed are for ""entry-level"" in all the sectors I know. But if workers join together to share expertise, we can all resist the zero-sum game that is the corporatists' dream. Young people, seek mentors and introductions, make a study of the process, look for ways to move sideways and just get into employment from which you can move to where you want to go, and take heart. Lots of other generations didn't have it easy either in entering work and they persisted - and can help."
2020-05-20 01:21:40,"Perhaps we should all define “recover”.

Might we all own less things, have less money, do less, travel less? This is not all bad, unless constant economic growth is the only goal that matters. Not everyone thinks it is.

Might constant economic growth be the wrong goal? Or perhaps for the US, it is inevitable that as our growth shrinks compared to China’s expansive growth, the US in the next 20-40 years must redefine its role in the world? Who might best lead us as a country into uncharted changes? Someone anchored to old ways, trying to recreate old ways, or someone open to see and build toward opportunities ahead?

Might younger generations not yet see amazing opportunities for real, meaningful change not yet apparent, and actively change the world for the better, in ways that will amaze us?

I found the headline and premise of this article, as well as inter-generational finger-pointing comments, limited and depressing. A pandemic by definition is tough on all, yet while we all sit around arguing about who’s got it tougher, doors are opening, and will continue to do so. 

Maybe it’s too early to think expansively about change ahead. Or maybe there’s no time like now."

But try being a 50+ applicant. I gave up trying to push into corporate, white-collar/intellectual jobs years ago and found another niche that suited me well. I don't make a lot of money but the trade-offs are amazing. I still look for opportunities that can feed my thirst for knowledge and creativity but I find that being adaptable has increased my patience and decreased stress. When my company went into furlough, I wasn't incredibly depressed or anxious.

Several positions later, I'm somehow managing corporate finance for a Fortune 500 company and using my journalism degree to investigate trends within the firm. The point is that your career  will never lead where you think it will, but if you commit to learning, ride the wave, and use your intuition it will take you far in life - no matter your major."

Who's going to fund Medicare and Social Security, after all, if school and working age people stop believing that investing in education and a career pays off? This is not just another recession. Without a plan people are not just going to bounce back from it, and unless we're careful the generations that immediately follow will also be imbued with the sense that doing well in high school isn't that critical, that going to college is too risky a proposition, and that hard work and dedication don't amount to much. This is a major depression that will change our culture and our view of work. Mass unemployment is clearly an urgent issue for the federal government to address head on -- the entity we hire to represent us and to work for us at times just like these."

There were summers when we were not allowed to go out because of the polio epidemics. We had to deal with the childhood illnesses and yes some were left permanently damaged. We had one car and if my mother needed to go somewhere she usually took the bus. Money was tight. Birthday gift back then might mean a book or maybe a sweater but not both. A vacation was going to visit my grandmother or maybe an aunt and uncle not Disneyland.
My sons were “encouraged “ to take AP classes in High School and as a result they entered college as sophomores. They were also “encouraged “ to have more than one major that would give them more flexibility when it came to their careers. They all know how handle money. That is not to say they have not made som3 mistakes. I had to laugh when my youngest son got married @nd asked for my recipe for soup. Growing up that was what they ate every Friday and Saturday in the winter. Lentil or bean soup made from the carcass of an oven stuffer. 
Every generation has had it’s own problems to deal with wars, depressions, epidemics and most have made it thru. Life is tough the question is are you."
2020-05-20 03:11:44,I’m glad we’re paying attention to this now. I graduated in the late 1980s into a crippling recession and there was no mercy anywhere. I had huge student loan payments and couldn’t find a job  anywhere and was told to take an unpaid internship and pay my student loans by moonlighting as a waitress at nights. It was brutal. And I never did catch up. I hope these young people are given more empathy and assistance.
2020-05-20 03:22:06,"Just to be clear, I have nothing against a student majoring in music or film or dance or acting. It's a tougher pill to swallow when the student has huge student loans and no foreseeable way to pay them back. I am a musician/vocal coach but it was disheartening to realize when I graduated in 1987 that the world wasn't clamoring to employ music majors at jobs that paid benefits, that would support my gigs. I graduated from Yale, thankfully with no student loans. I can't imagine having tens of thousands to pay back while making a starter wage in a (most-often) low paying, unreliable field."

High unemployment, high housing costs, and crazy high college costs can put a person starting out way behind the 8 ball.  I wonder if our educational structures and our social structures are just not a good fit for what our people need to prosper anymore.  

I also wonder whether young people will ever get their faces out of their cell phones long enough to understand that voting matters, union organization is possible, college costs/loans need to be carefully considered before attending,hard work still matters, and old guys like me have trouble sympathizing with young folks who whine instead of taking action"

When one drives one's Porsche up besides a Tesla on the highway, one feels no sense of being out-tasted, out-Liberal'ed or out-greened. Musk and Ivanka. Bombastic, one.  Naive the other. If you look closely, the enormous plant in China may require you to go to Shanghai to drop your red pill. At the cost of American jobs.  To be fair, its the same for all major consumer companies in America. Sadly, his drive to invent the future is coming at a time when the people need medicine, leadership, food, sanity. Not trips to the moon. Not red pills.  I can see why the shareholders might be a bit concerned as Mr. Musk is a loose cannon and the Tesla Board of Directors, as is so true thoughout corporate governance these days, do not represent the shareholders but are sychophants to Mr. Musk. Fragile situation."

I can choose from a slew of highly competitive e-cars, from companies that have a century plus of experience at producing cars at reasonable cost.  Tesla will just become the Studebaker of the early 21st century.

Frankly, I couldn't care less if he wants to vote for Trump, but I think he is catching Trump's mental illness to think that he is impressing his 'base' by insulting the vast majority of them. Maybe he is stewing in his bedroom, arms crossed, rocking back and forth like Trump does at one of his briefings, trying to come up with some other nasty idea to stir people up; time for the board to remove him."

In this case I can't say-- I don't know much about Musk or macroeconomics. But it seems there is a pattern with media outlets' business models, and maybe if we become aware of it we can have some power over it, instead of the other way around.

2020-05-20 15:32:59,"The issue is that while both Tesla and SpaceX have products that are revolutionary and the majority of people agree are beneficial, the companies have been successful largely due to the cult of personality around Elon.  

It is largely this cult of personality that enables him to 1) hire smart math & science college-graduates for fractions of their market value and get them to work 60 hrs weeks, 2) sell as much product as he does with customers giving him a pass on the initial reliability of his products (remember the part about the new hires w/ no experience?), and 3) get enough venture capital to get by.  He knows this, which is why he could not end his social-media career even after being sanctioned by the SEC.  

The US could let Elon dive off into the looney bin if we had a reliable means of investing in environmentally-friendly, forward-looking technology.  Instead we have a political system continually milking the future to bolster technological dinosaurs (coal, oil, etc.) and complain about the working conditions required to make cutting-edge technology profitable."

It signals nothing more than good taste — the perfect balance of wealth with care for fossil fuels. But the man behind the brand is crafting a very different persona online that may now prove to be a challenge for his fans.

This is an iconic demonstration of ""liberals"" being duped by marketing skills spewed by a libertarian.   It's the sociopathic marketeers playbook and is the stock in trade of both Musk and Trump.. and was part and parcel to how Jobs brain worked as well.

Honestly, if your are so foolish as to drink the libertarian kool-aid and proclaim it a progressive vintage of some fine beverage  ... you deserve to see and experience the continued collapse of progressive values in American society.

Until he gets firmly put in his place.... his tweets and other comments will simply get more and more weird.

By the way... red pill green pill.. simply a metaphor for making a choice between good and evil.  People like Musk believe government of any kind is evil if it interferes with him personally, and it is good when it interferes with anyone or anything  he dislikes."

2020-05-20 15:54:16,"Elon Musk is a classic example of that guy from school you knew that was a late, late bloomer, but is still filled with insecurities from his time as a young man. His wealth and power are enormous, but deep down he still craves attention and throws Twitter fits like a hormonal 16 year old would. 

Admittedly, he's done a fantastic job of creating a Steve Jobs/Trump-like reality distortion field. These days he leans more towards Trump, bloviating about ridiculous sci-fi pipe dreams like the Hyperloop to distract from missing his own production targets for Tesla. Steve Jobs was full of it too, but he didn't pitch himself as anything beyond a salesman for pricey electronic trinkets. 

Musk's rabid fanbase on the other hand sees him as real-life Tony Stark, and as someone 'more relatable' than other CEOs because of his juvenile tweeting and dumb publicity stunts like selling flamethrowers for $500."

It's only par for the course that people like Musk (and Trump) must lie to themselves and others that their motivations are morally pure and are based on the ""truth"".  In fact the only genius that Musk has shown is his capitalizing on others true genius in developing the what is now called the Tesla engine. I have a young relative who has worked at Tesla Fremont and can tell you about his disregard for his workers health and welfare. Of course, Musk is fanatically anti-union.  Living in a world in which the predatory moneyed elite and their political cronies urge their prey to celebrate with them sounds like the blue pill to me."

Going to Mars is far harder and living there is just ridiculous to think about now.  Even if we had the technology, which is doubtful, we have important issues here at home that we are struggling to deal with.

It really just confirms what is already know about him; he thinks he's smarter than everyone else, he can't take criticism, and he's a classic narcissist.

They are people who are rich by all accounts and who nicely benefit from the society as it is, as demonstrated by their beloved ' luxurious electric car'.  Their posh engagement in the 'social justice' battle is disingenuous."

2020-05-20 16:50:36,"The claim that Elon Musk is any kind of liberal is just plain weird to me: The core of liberal ideals, to me at least, is that the success of humanity is measured by how badly off the worst-off people are, and you don't end up a billionaire if you're trying to do your part by, say, paying your employees generously or donating extremely heavily to charity. Elon Musk, by contrast, has been keeping most of his money, ruthlessly busts unions, and supports some really questionably governments worldwide in order to extract raw materials for his products at favorable prices.

Any idea that Elon Musk was anything other than a typical profit-seeking businessman was simply the result of marketing, nothing more. Which means that Musk's embrace of the president and ""red-pill"" conspiracy theories doesn't surprise me in the slightest."

- It is not a ""zero emission"" vehicle, given that a not-insignificant fraction of the electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels.
- Many of the rare non-renewable raw materials that go into building these monuments to stupidity, notably lithium, are critically scarce, with supplies likely yo run out in a few decades at most.
- Other materials, such as rare earths, are more abundant, but their mining, refining and supply are a Chinese monopoly (they control about 95% of the world market). Because of the vagaries of the distribution of mineral resources, this is unlikely to change.
- Extracting and refining many of these raw materials has horrendous environmental consequences, which remain hidden because these activities take place in remote undeveloped parts of the world. But the cost to wildlife, wilderness and human health are astronomical.
- For those who care, there are also terrible social and humanitarian issues related to extraction and refining of these materials, such as the possible use of slave or semi-slave labor in China and in African countries controlled by China.

2020-05-20 14:03:34,"Musk must be feeding some kind of pills to his customers for them to pay $40,000 and much higher for vehicles with questionable build quality and some of the cheapest interiors in the auto industry.  I think a lot of Tesla owners buy them to brag about them and really don’t know very much about cars. You see a lot of their social media posts in which they feel the need to convince themselves that they made a good choice.

The electric technology is available from a growing number of more-established, better-managed competitors in much more usable packages at comparable or lower prices (Kia’s Niro comes to mind), so I believe Musk’s days are numbered as an automaker.  Perhaps this helps to explain his odd behavior."

Of course, men also have a higher standard deviation of talent. This point is germane to Google, but was not made by Damore.

These are the people profiting from the world’s largest military-industrial complex that also consumes the lives of the children of the poor in the name of patriotic profit.

These are the people who profit from the globalised outsourcing of jobs and manufacturing to the lowest cost supplier leaving western economies impotent and unable to manufacture items as basic as face masks and protective gowns and gloves.

The US economy exists in a twilight zone where its core capability is to manufacture new debt to fund its continued existence and relevance, the real economic power having long since passed to China.

The GOP has built a fantasy world and connected its supporters by umbilical cords delivering a stream of psychoactive manipulation 

The brand colour of the GOP is red but that is where the connection to the red and blue pills of the Matrix ends.

Taking the red pill is to strip away the lies and the deceit to see reality laid bare.

In November 2020 one hopes Americans will have finally truly understood how bitter that pill really is and that they will vote for politicians who will serve them all and not just the rich."

In a sane or honest world it wouldn't even have been the slightest bit controversial.  But sanity and honesty are the not the goals when you have a social narrative to forward. 

Damore was ruined for not affirming what he was supposed to affirm, that the only possible reason Silicon Valley and Google don't have ""enough"" female engineers is sexism and the patriarchy.

One is responsible for bringing an astonishing paradigm shift for the better to the auto industry, and the other for taking a lead in the massive and corrupt lie that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, suffering, and the destruction of world order that continues to have ramifications to this day.  

What does being a liberal or a conservative mean ultimately? End the end, isn't it all about what kind of people we want to be and how we want to live? I follow Elon Musk but don't find him particularly likeable. I think he's reached that particular point of vainglory even more over the top than Steve Jobs simply due to the fact that we now fully live in an age of online worship of outrageous personalities.  Even so, the fact that his political views, which is actually part of the mainstream whether we like it or not, is written about, judged publicly, and excoriated while we let the David Frums of this world run rampant again simply for being anti-Trump tells me that the green pill, blue pill or whatever is the opposite of the red pill, is ultimately not the world I want to live in. 

You may not like his views or his narcissism, but Elon Musk is a particular outlier within the human-world who's doing great, remarkable things. We need him and others like him. He is certainly not evil. Stop trying to put labels and painting him into a corner."

Then I read the other side of the argument, the one which showed all of the factual inaccuracies and logical fallacies in the movie, the one which showed that the official version of the JFK assassination was actually far more reasonable than any other alternative theory.  And instead of digging deeper down into the conspiracy rabbit hole like a lot of people do, I realized I was wrong.  That I had been misled.  I learned about the psychology of conspiracy theories and I’ve never been misled by one since, even when they appeal to my political sensibilities.

Some people thought the moon brought disease; some probably still do.  Some thought praying to Saint So-and-So could heal; many still do.

2020-05-20 11:57:48,"The hallmark thing that distinguishes conspiracy theories from other forms of speculation is that evidence *against* it is interpreted as evidence *for* it—the “that’s what they want you to think” phenomenon.

But there is a weakness there, and it is in the ability of powerful personalities to break the cycle of misinformation. Conspiracy theorists do not trust “facts,” they trust PEOPLE, which is why these obvious hawkers of half-truths can get away with murder: they are The Trusted Group, so whatever they say, no matter how kooky and weird, will be trusted by their followers. 

There is exactly one person in America who can kneecap this entire enterprise, because he is the most Trusted of them all. He could use his influence to guide people in the direction of the real truth, and people would actually follow.  Unfortunately, he shows us every day that his primary concern is not the truth, but rather enabling conspiracy theorists for political expediency’s sake."

I explained this was false information, and when I arrived home, there were six or seven observations of ""proof"" that I was wrong:  all quackery.  It's like society has stepped back 100 years with the spreading of this false information, which I USED to think occurred from a lack of education and the fact that it was spread by mouth.  I now think it's human nature to belong to a group/cult and then believe whatever is fed to you by that cult."

It is much easier to create a boogeyman in these times. It gives you an enemy to focus on - be it Bill Gates, the Deep State, etc. - blame, hate and rail against. It means that the dangers in the world are the fault of a few bad actors that we can isolate and fight against, rather than that of a naturally dangerous world that requires a much more complicated and thoughtful effort in order to protect ourselves.

In short, conspiracy theories are the solace of the cowardly. And every one of those likes, subscribes, shares and follows is a coward."

I'm a retired librarian and academic library director, and for the 40+ years I was employed I devoted considerable energy to furthering what we call 'information literacy; which, in part, teaches people to be critical and discerning consumers of information. There are ways to rank the likely integrity of a source, but that depends largely on our ability to say confidently why one source is generally more trustworthy than another. 

This job is not made easier by government and high officials who traffic in lies and conspiracies as a matter of course for personal profit or political gain. When lies become government policy, the whole thing goes out the window. I am beginning to get very apprehensive about the future of our country, as our vital institutions are corrupted, possibly irreversibly.

It would be nice if we could teach, as foundation principles of information literacy, such concepts as Occam's Razor, for instance, devised by a 13th/ 14th century theologian, that says if there is a problem with multiple possible solutions, the most likely one to be true is the simplest. Just applying Occam's Razor, you can see how most conspiracy theories immediately fall apart. But often the truth is less satisfying than a well-crafted lie."

As the video was just beginning to pick up steam, YouTube’s “censorship” (as it was called) became ammunition to keep sharing it and getting people to watch it. “Oh God, they’re trying to silence the truth. Hurry up and listen before the evil forces try to keep you in the dark.” Almost every link I received for this video from May 5th to May 7th included a dismayed comment by the sharer that YouTube had already taken down the first link they shared, so watch it *right now* before it’s too late. This included trusted people who aren’t conspiracy theorists. Taking down the videos, while obviously well-intended (and maybe even required by some of the new policies since 2016), added fuel to the fire by serving as “evidence” that the video was true. This article’s concluding paragraph makes it seem like FB and YouTube only took the Plandemic video down once it had gone viral (e.g. “By then it had hit the mainstream”). In reality, YouTube had been taking it down from the start, and this ironically played a critical role in helping the video spread, however unintentionally."

This nonsense likely wouldn’t be covered, but if it were, it would be of a guy with an aluminum foil head piece on in his basement.

It seems to be a blend of inferiority and narcissism. They not only stick to their lies after it's been disproven by countless unbiased fact checkers, but they go deeper. I believe this stage is when their identities have adhered to the lie and there is no backing out for them. 
As far as autism and the parents who stick to these debunked medical theories. They are conflicted and traumatized women angry and hurt over the misfortune of their child's autism. The timing of vaccinations in kids, around 3 years of age, fits perfectly for a conspiracist. There seems to also be a blame game, this awful thing couldn't have come from our genes. Sad stuff.

Milton Cooper was sure that the U.S. Government would confiscate our gun, rescind the bill of  rights, and send any who resisted to secret concentration camps. Conspiracy theory has been with us since the beginning, inciting war, hatred, division, and (in Hofstadter's terms) paranoia. It is the classic form of scapegoating, the secular version of a millennialism that never materializes. Some whites, who have no history of being enslaved, for some reason are highly susceptible to this infectious fear of being enslaved. Conspiracy theory spreads like wildfire, then goes into remission for a while, evolves and then re-emerges in each new generation, like a virus.  It certainly has done more harm, and resulted in more deaths and ruined lives, than most biological viruses."

C) it’s hard to believe that a documentary or news report on a viral illness would have blatantly false material such as in Plandemic.
d) But it’s also hard to believe that the Surgeon General would tell the American Public to stop wearing masks and that CNN and many other news outlets would tell people to stop wearing masks. And then do a 180 without acknowledging the history.
e) that was a whopper that exceeded the falsehoods on Plandemic and actually cost many lives.
f) better education and openness about “Science” is desperately needed. It’s not all knowing as is often represented by its deities who are often representing special interests.
g) Dr. Northrup an experienced physician has ethical culpability regarding spreading the Plandemic fiction. She knows better and if she doesn’t she needs to retire.
h) The spreading of Plandemic through social media was a well told story by the NYTimes.
i) But tell the story of how not wearing masks went viral or the study on 8 patients on Moderna’s vaccine moved the markets and made insiders rich or how Dr. Fauci got to be deified so that by definition his pronouncements are accepted as truth.

Strangely I heard nothing by Dr. Gupta sounding the alarm as CNNs chief medical correspondent about the looming pandemic or 2020. Maybe that was because there was only airtime through February 7th for another major story that gripped the nation: the impeachment of President Trump.I  read the reports of an outbreak in China with trepidation ( I am a retired M.D.) but Trump, Pelosi, Schiff and McConnell were consumed by a failed attempt to remove the President.

Now they're loosening the very underpinnings of the entire nation."

When does common sense prevail? I mean come on - the sheer number of people needed to plan for a pandemic, doing something so evil, then keeping it a secret? Is there absolutely no awareness of human nature?"
2020-05-20 12:52:21,"This saddens me. The fact that people cook up these conspiracy theories suggests to me there are citizens so deeply resented with society they feel compelled to conjure fantasies where the world is a deeply evil place, where everyone is against them, and where they are the solitary champions of a neglected truth. I think this speaks volumes about an unmet mental health problem.

On the other hand, the fact that so many more people buy into these theories, despite the fact that none of them resists even the most gentle analysis, is indicative to me of a fundamentally failed education system. While the Times makes a fair point on the importance of aggressively reporting falsehoods, I think the issue is much deeper: you wouldn't need to warn people about falsehoods if our schooling systems prepared citizens to think critically about information and, crucially, gave them even passing competence on statistics. Basic statistics knowledge gives you all the tools you need to debunk any conspiracy theory.

I believe these problems will continue plaguing society until we seriously set out to meet our much-neglected public health and education needs. And that is not only true in the U.S., but in a large part of the planet."
2020-05-20 12:55:25,"I used to think humans have gotten smarter over the centuries but I really don't think it's true. It's easy to look at the absurd belief systems of the past and wonder how they could have caught on as they did in their own viral ways of their times. 

Stuff like this today shows people haven't gotten any better at critical thinking. The difference now is that technology allows viral ideas to spread exponentially faster, and therefore are exponentially more dangerous to society. It's also more dangerous because the purveyors understand the formula and execute campaigns with sophisticated and corrupt intent. 

 What to do? We can't wind back the clock on technology. Stricter speech laws for big tech is all well and good when it's somebody else's wrong ideas, until the tables turn and they come after your own beliefs and values. I don't think that's just dystopian fantasy given our current political climate. 

By the way, Facebook's ""False Information"" fact-checker notice has the opposite effect with conspiracy theorists - it's a badge of honor and ""proof"" they're being silenced."
2020-05-20 12:56:41,"Throughout human history, when societies have had to confront difficult times -- when people have been disoriented, frightened, uncertain of the future -- they have almost invariably turned toward conspiracy theories.  Some things are simply hard to accept: that the world can be random, provisional, uncertain.  It's easier -- it's more comforting -- to think there some kind of hidden plan being carried out by malevolent forces.

This human tendency goes way back.  When Rome burned and Nero fiddled, the whole thing was blamed on the Christians.

During the Black Plague in the Middle Ages, it was the work of the Devil.

In Germany during the 1930's, the country's troubles were all the fault of the Jews.

The unforgivable results of this is often the murder of innocents -- the Christians in Rome, the women burned as witches in the middle ages, and, in our own time, the ovens at Auschwitz.

It's hard to accept the randomness of the world, the contingency -- the fact that terrible things sometimes just HAPPEN.  It's much easier, and much more comforting, to believe there's some kind of hidden plot behold it all, or that there are simple, easy solutions. 

It takes courage to accept this world as we find it, and do our best to confront its challenges directly.  In these past few months, we'v e seen -- yes, the cowardice of self-delusion -- but also the courage of mankind at its best."
2020-05-20 12:57:06,"In antiquity, the people blamed war,  pestilence, famine, droughts, and earthquakes on the gods plotting against one another or taking vengeance on humanity for some minor affront.   Now, it is the “Elites’’.  

The ancients could be excused for their conspiracy of the gods theories because they didn’t have the scientific knowledge necessary to make sense out of natural disasters.   

Conspiracy theories are emotionally satisfying because  they lead to a simple explanation for the troubles, even if the conspiracy theory itself requires an understanding of a complex web of “facts”.  In fact, for some, the more complex the web the more satisfying the theory, because the “facts” are only known to the few smart enough to grasp them and their hidden meaning.

That’s when the principle of Occam’s Razor comes in handy.  And a willingness to challenge your own beliefs with logic and countervailing facts."
2020-05-20 12:58:45,"Several years ago I developed a theory about conspiracies - that they are extremely addictive to some people.

I personally know people who are consumed by conspiracies to the point that they have alienated friends and family.  It's no different than an alcohol/opioid/meth addict."

One could argue that stopping disinformation and misinformation is in the public interest, but there's another angle: it's also a tawdry click-bait story that generates views and reader engagement (including this comment, ironically). There's more than a little hypocrisy here, the same as when the media gave huge amounts of space and free air time to Donald Trump in 2015-16 because he made for compelling viewing.

To viral chicanery and propaganda, they are at high risk of infection.

Fortunately, most of us remain immune through a sort of vaccination effort known as quality public education, mentorship and responsible parenting.

Meanwhile, a few of us started pointing out inconsistencies and how there really isn't a point to the ""scheme"".  Who was making the money?  How? Why was the rest of the world affected? If doctors, hospitals and nursing homes are being paid to fabricate these deaths, how have so many remained silent?  Why have only two doctors come forward?

2020-05-20 13:15:38,"A vaccine might help a lot of people. But I urge us to see the other side.

A side where there is a waste culture driven by profit. One that offers its population trash to eat. Processed foods coming from long chains of labor, having at one end the vulnerable and suffering, and on the other the greed of endless profit. At one end, the merciless practice of mono crops and animal slaughter by the billion, and at the other end food that is disease rather than medicine. 

Most of us live in cities, and here we make a contribution to a system that is by default NOT sustainable. For it thrives through the extraction and destruction of what is around, and does not see it’s own land as fertile. All soil hidden by concrete. 

Let us not believe in the vaccine as the cure for this. The virus might be dictating who lives and who dies based on what has been done to the internally polluted city bodies of the masses. There is a system of killing going on. Those who are poor have little access to nutrient dense foods and air worth breathing. These will suffer most. If you have access, should it not be ‘mandatory’ to eat an abundance of fruits and vegetables? Exercise/meditate 30 minutes a day?

Meat and cheese in this country seems to be as mandatory to our diets as a possible vaccine. Someone is profiting from that, even if their own guts are deteriorating.

When we don't even know that much about this disease, how long natural immunity lasts, or what the real death rate is?  Why would I take a vaccine from a company that has never put a product on the market?  Nobody has ever been successful in making a vaccine against any kind of coronavirus, and this Moderna has the idea of ALTERING OUR RNA - turning us into experimental GMO's.   Moderna got the contract because they caught our President's limited attention span in a sales pitch when they claimed they could get it done faster than anyone else.

Feelings of vulnerability and fear make people feel helpless and weak. Nobody likes that. Being able to blame someone based on some celebrity endorsed story makes people feel knowledgeable. Righteous anger feels a lot more powerful than helpless fear and confusion.

Second, the Facebook phenomenon has more to do with the psychology of its users than a 'mysterious force' of someone pushing this video viral. From my personal experience, many users who would believe this video rely on Facebook heavily for their news. I believe this to be because it not only keeps them in a nice little bubble where everything comes from like minded friends, perfectly filtered for their beliefs.

Prior to the internet—and an act of Congress protecting internet publishers from liability which still applies everywhere else—there were very few widely-believed hoaxes with this kind of destructive potential. 

One earlier example, ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" stands out. Other comparable examples are hard to find. The authors of would-be hoaxes could not get them published, because private editors stood in the way.

Now, absent editing prior to publication, every kind of hoax, defamation, election interference scam, purely private spiteful utterances, and tinfoil hat conspiracy theory finds currency before anything can be done to alleviate the damage. The power inherent in publishing makes that dangerous. 

Congress would do well to reconsider, and once again apply publishing liability uniformly, including internet publishers with the others.

It is my opinion, which stands on the shoulders of experts, it is no exaggeration to say that vaccines remain, along with basic sanitation our most effective tool against deadly pathogens. It has been so effective in eradicating a range of childhood diseases that some are taking their absence for granted.
 
Ironically, this movement recalls the dawn of vaccines when even doctors were also quick to clamber onto the anti-vaccination bandwagon. But they, at least, had the excuse of lack of established knowledge."

What would be refreshing and honest would be for the nytimes to tackle head on all of the questions that have been raised about the effectiveness of vaccines.  What would be even better would be for the nytimes to give legitimacy to the fact that natural foods and medicines heal the body equally well if not infinitely better than drugs fabricated in a laboratory.  Millions of people understand that this virus is a serious threat to our health yet we just don´t agree with how to prevent illness and how to heal if and when we do get sick.

Such lies are believed by people who already want to believe them, and it would help to refer to the DSM to figure out which spectrum such liars and their followers belong to and publish it.

The damage via Whatsapp must be as big if not bigger than via Facebook and YouTube alone. I am connected with social as well as professional groups from India, Russia, Ukraine and South America. The spread of antagonism against Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, without the background context of U.S. internal politics, is troubling.  At one point, anti-vaccine videos (poorly produced ones at that) against Gates and Pirbright Institute were circulating alongside an old satire piece from The Onion with a fictitious professor from Purdue advocating for killing a chunk of the world''s population to save the world. In other words, the unique brand of Onion's wry humor too was lost in translation. A classmate from the past who is in clinical work, not research -- and unfortunately does not understand the vital difference between the two -- smugly declared after promoting the 'Plandemic': there can be no smoke without fire.

But it is also a global megaphone to spread divisive falsehoods as well.  This video is no different than the use of social media by violent extremist groups such as Boka Haram which uses the internet to to broadcast that the pandemic is a Western tool to decimate the people of Africa.

So humanity has an incredibly powerful tool at its disposal and, while many use it to move humanity forward, there are also those who abuse it through spreading the most ridiculous conspiracies and falsehoods.  Conspiracies like Plandemic may be attractive to some because it allows them to dismiss the factual information that can be quite scary and create a sense of powerlessness, like a lethal pandemic that has no easy answers, with a fairy tale that channels that fear and apprehension into anger and rage - unfortunately emotions that humans somehow feel more comfortable expressing.

The internet demonstrates the best and worst of humanity.  It illuminates how far we have progressed and how far we still have to go in education and critical thought.  This moment in time feels like a regression in our collective evolutionary history and we have no one to blame but ourselves."

The paranoia has stayed a constant feature of the American political scene. The social media have vastly amplified the reach of such messages deliberately broadcast to sow chaos, panic, and rage.  It would not be surprising to find that they have a state sponsor in Putin's Russia, just like the rest of the massive intervention in American politics since 2016."

Anyway, it's a well-funded, carefully assembled, rigorously administered cabal of people supported by the insurance industry and Big Pharma.  And DeVos.

Their one goal is to prevent people from benefiting from the low-profit, deeply effective plague of generic vaccines flooding the world.

There's no profit in preventing disease when you can spend billions on research, employ thousands of the best minds, and patent and sell an outlandish variety of prescription medicine and over-the-counter products.

There are trillions at stake, and decades of increasing corporate earnings and the political influence that always follows money.

I uncovered piles of reports and confidential emails gloating how easy it is to hire actors to play worried moms and angry patriots; the cost-to-profit ratio makes the CDC budget look like a poor dad's change jar.

Huge corporate powers such as Google/Youtube and Facebook/Instagram remove a video that claims that a group of elites is controlling the coronavirus narrative.  They also remove videos featuring actual epidemiologists such as Dolores Cahill who happen to disagree with the majority of other epidemiologists.

Corporate censorship (yeah, it's perfectly constitutional, I know) feeds the conspiracy.  I find it really odd that liberals think that corporate censorship is a good thing.  Citizens United, for example, gives too much power to corporations; I think they should be banned from participating in politics, period.  And corporations certainly should not be the gatekeepers of ""truth."""
2020-05-20 14:30:40,"This article reveals the paradox surrounding conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns like Plandemic: When platforms such as Facebook and YouTube take down these kinds of things, responding to public pressure to be more discerning in what they allow, they effectively remove it from the public sphere and drive it underground where only the ""crazies"", devoted to this kind of messaging, have access.

The problem with this is that people who have the ability to debunk this kind of misinformation have difficulty accessing it, and are essentially forbidden by those same platforms from exposing it as false. If I post the video to my timeline with a point by point rebuttal, the video will be taken down almost immediately, and I am threatened with banishment.

I'm not advocating for anything here, just making the point that demanding that social media platforms become the arbiter of what will and won't be made public has the unintended consequence of removing things like Plandemic from the sight of those who find it repulsive, without removing it from the sphere where it will have the most influence, the underground conspiracy community. And, such banning adds fuel to the fire that ""they"" are out to control us and keep us from knowing the truth."

It's a religion beyond anything we've seen before and it's only going to get worse. This pandemic is nothing compared to the poison that is willingly being ingested by the believers. If it were only them being harmed, I wouldn't be so alarmed. But it's not. Paranoia and fear is contagious.

The bottom line is that we have been lied to, repeaedly, leaving us wondering who to believe.  This is compounded by Trumps constant ""fake news"" drumbeat.  If the news is fake, well, what to do?

She was a first-class researcher whose work went back for decades and who found troubling evidence that mouse virus tissue being used in the production of a particular vaccine could lead to devastating health problems. But here's the other side: Ms. Mikovits is also a rabble-rouser who loves conflict and makes statements such as that wearing masks can give you the Covid-19 virus. How crazy is that? So who to believe? But it's undeniable (do the research) that the vaccine industry is corrupt, that the CDC is a captured agency (revolving doors between jobs there and in the industry) and that Bill Gates' plan for mandatory vaccinations of an RNA vaccine coupled with 5G tracking is madness.

What he didn't tell you is that many Martians went with the the moon when it separated and then set up secret underground laboratories on the moon itself. 

Our astronauts discovered those labs and secret viruses that they then brought back to Earth. Now those viruses are being released by our own deep state (underground, of course)  to facilitate the destruction of the non-elites.

Could it be because a cabal of elites lie to Americans on a daily basis? 

Does it have anything to do with dis-empowerment of the majority caused by wealth hoarding, tax evasion, and bailouts? 

Could elites being above the law have some impact?

Is it related to corporate media sensationalizing conspiratorial news for profit? 

Are people paranoid because their government is illegally spying on them?

Is there a possible link to rampant corruption in elite universities? 

Or perhaps its tied to people being hoodwinked into lifelong debt by higher education? 

Does widespread rigging of elections play a role?

How about legislators enacting aggressive policies of big business, while pretending to care about citizens?

People sense that a cabal of plutocratic, sociopathic liars has in fact taken over America. We can wonder at the wild conspiracies this situation generates--which makes for good news.

Then, they could get some secret video of those people unzipping themselves from body bags and walking back out.

Much akin to the two year military obligation by Israelis, the youth of America would be conscripted to complete an expanded educational perspective so suggested.  How so?  Why so? One solution provided for An expanded deliberation goes as follows:
Format: require a (1) course in biology, including how facts determine conclusions, (2) a course in statistics vs calculus where one learns to elicit trends on issues via mass data analysis, (3) a course featuring The History of Western Philosophy- author Bertrand Russell, all so (A)myths/beliefs vs (B) science can be parsed via a study of thinkers examining the zones between A and B, (4) a course-combined featuring drama, visual art, survey of Western music, 7 books from World literature and readings from at least 20 poets across the ages and (5) retaking each course until achieving a minimum grade of a D+/C- ....and you Then ask:  Why so low a threshold? 
Answer: a bit of knowledge past ignorance is better than the void of complete ignorance guiding democratic/ republican decision making into the future.
Outcome: Increased chance of a  acquiring a thinking level arising from a “reality” expanded, one way past illegitimate/incomplete facts, irresponsible research, and belief  systems dystopian.

Sometimes I wonder why I even read the comments anymore. They are so predictable. The article is either brilliant (and obvious to any intelligent person) or it’s stupid (and “fake” to any intelligent person).

We all think we’re so intelligent (just like we all think we’re above average drivers). But here’s a thought: maybe, just maybe, you’re not really that smart. You’re not stupid, but you’re not smart either. You’re average (maybe even below average). Smart enough to make a living, attract a mate, and raise a couple of decent kids, but you ain’t neva goin’ ta Hahvahd.

So what’s my point?  In a nutshell, we’re all living through an experiment. Not as a species or a nation, but as individuals. I’m not talking about the COVID-19 experience. I’m talking about the mystery of existence. And, more specifically, conscious, sentient existence. Because it’s an individual experience, we each think we’re so special, so smart. News flash: we’re not.

Anybody with sound mind would've questioned such behavior, yet people bit line, hook and sinker and Mikovits became their prophet.

Then, the producer gets other ""experts"" to endorse the lying expert.  These other ""experts"" also make money off of the lying ""expert"" through clicks, likes and shares on their own platforms.  The epidemic part of the ""plandemic"" is the insatiable hunger of conspiracy theorists for anything that will feed their biggest addiction -- hate.  True conspiracy theorists, as differentiated from the fake ones who don't believe their own lies and just want to make money, hate some aspect of themselves.  Someone must be to blame for this inner turmoil, and they lack the emotional intelligence to sort it all out.  Once they start blaming something or someone else, they can redirect the focus away from hating and blaming themselves to hating and blaming  another.  They can't stop hating altogether, because it is an addiction.  Hate feels good to them.  Conspiracy theories provide a great outlet for expression of their hate.

He was obsessed with conspiracy theories and yet couldn’t see what was obvious to everyone else, like his wife’s long term affair. It was funny. Now that Facebook has allowed the Dale Gribble’s of the world to congregate and broadcast their “secret knowledge”, it’s not so funny. I still remember the jolt I felt when an otherwise respected coworker sincerely reported that Charles Manson had been released because she’d seen it on Facebook. It works because some people prefer a juicy story over un-exciting facts."

The belief-driven folks appear to have missed critical thinking skills.  They also haven't the faintest understanding of concepts like confirmation bias and how to avoid it.  I know that's harsh, but I can see no other explanation in their blindly buying into garbage like Pandemic and QAnon spewed by rags like Epoch Times.

I have a cousin who (supposedly) had a strong business career.  Yet he seems to accept that our countries ""CEO"" can function without integrity, responsibility, or accountability and he dispenses this conspiracy theory trash.  When asked that he no longer send me an unwanted links to videos like that touting Judy Mitkovits as one of 'the greatest scientists of her generation' his response was to (a) not apologize and (b) to insult my ""worldview.""  

So, the belief crowd has fully subsumed even trump behavior--never apologize even when you're wrong and insult instead.  Folks like my cousin know better but have tossed their own integrity in the trash bin--amazing how can ever they look themselves in the eyes in a mirror."

Nor is there anything new about the solution. It’s called education, a field in which the United States used to be a leader. 

One of the saddest things to have watched over the past thirty years has been the decline of the U.S. public education system, which (if not perfect) was at least good in certain parts. 

But you reap what you sow. A society that comes to rely on rote learning and standardized tests will ultimately have no defense against charlatans claiming to be authorities. And given that much of the rote learning is focused on material of questionable relevance, why are we surprised that its subjects are so eager to embrace simpler and more congenial alternatives. 

The answer will not lie in censorship. However, we cannot expect people raised in stupidity and helplessness to grasp either the problem or its solution. The leadership will have to come from the “educated” elites that allowed this situation to develop. The skinhead with the gun is only the face of the problem.

Until educators demystify the sciences we will seep even further into the misinformation machine that exists on social media.

We can't control 'theories' and so far haven't filtered much of the internet, but we can teach people to check sources, look for the preponderance of evidence and try to make reasonable judgements.

2020-05-20 19:04:40,"Many want to believe that their own ""common sense"" is superior to all the education of the elites (a word that has been bandied about even on the editorial pages of the Times). It may be satisfying to feel that you are smarter than the snowflake, hyper-educated do-gooders. It's also soothing.

A good conspiracy theory reduces the complexity of a frightening situation. It feels logical--which is different from being logical. It pulls together snippets of information and assumptions into a coherent narrative that neatly ties up the uncertainty of, in this case, how the novel coronavirus has been able to derail  human life across the globe. It's satisfying to create that kind of narrative in the face of such a sudden shift. Better yet is having someone do the tying up for you and feed you the narrative. 

That's the purpose of conspiracy theories and theorists serve: they sooth the minds of people who don't have the time, energy and/or desire to piece together the complex, and as yet incomplete, truth. In addition, a good conspiracy theory bolsters its believers' sense of themselves as knowing something that all the scientists--and the benighted populace that listens to those scientists--don't know. 

The nature of rigorous scientific inquiry is that it's imperfect and incomplete; it changes when new, more solid evidence comes in. Good science admits that it doesn't have all the answers. That may be too scary and out-of-control for those who buy into conspiracy theories."

Her move seemed to be part of an audition for vice president. The mayor of Chicago closed a giant park that runs across the whole lakefront, even thought studies show that only one third of one percent of Covid transmissions occur outdoors. Despite the fact that Illinois' new cases and deaths are gradually going down, and percent positive PCR tests are way down, a couple of days ago Governor Prtizker announced (without benefit of any legislative process) prison time for businesses violating his orders, which were also without benefit of legislation. Fortunately, public outcry forced him to back down.  Emergencies are an excuse for fascism.

Too early to tell but probably a good idea when it's ready.........do you get a flu shot?""  To which they responded ""Maybe not anymore, heard a rumor it might make you more susceptible to being seriously ill with COVID"".  At the time I knew nothing of Plandemic but now having watched Dr. Mike debunk most of it, I realize that this rumor is embedded in the video.

They had never heard of the term commonly used in medicine and statistics, ""Correlation is not causation"", so at least I gave them a little something to mull.

I agree with those saying it may be our human tendency to believe what we hear from the group we feel we belong to, or wish to belong to.  It's easier to accept information that way, without questioning, no matter how smart we are.  It's perhaps more an issue of effort and time, and the discomfort that arises when we disagree with the consensus of our group.

2020-05-20 21:26:07,"There is a simple reason conspiracy theories like Plandemic spread like viruses and most of the NYT Top Commenters are missing it. It's not that so many people are ignorant or uneducated in science. They DO NOT TRUST the ""experts,"" whether it be government, media, doctors or university professors. Why don't they trust the experts? Because in many cases, experts have abused the trust people formerly placed in them. 

Here's one example. When the news of COVID-19 exploded on to everyone's feed, people naturally started wearing face masks. Health officers at every level - county, state and federal - and the main media outlets all cried out with one voice saying, ""you do not need face masks. They won't help you. Doctors and nurses need them; you do not."" 

A few weeks later, the same experts who said we don't need face masks said we DO need face masks. About a week later (mid-April in my county) face coverings became mandatory. So, what changed? Science? No. Scientists knew from the beginning that face masks are helpful. THEY LIED and the media reported their lies as truth. They encouraged people to go about their essential activities sans face coverings for a month, spreading virus germs wherever the infected went so they could gather more face masks for front line health care workers. So, why should we trust the experts? 

Why not trust a discredited, censored doctor?"

To pave the way to acceptance for any vaccine that gets put out there. Who could expect a safe vaccine when the manufacturers have no liability? Why do we have regulatory agencies if we could trust corporations? The FDA cannot be trusted to save us from faulty vaccines since they never have in the past.
2020-05-21 01:15:57,"What is most strikingly and alarmingly dangerous about this narrative is that it disempowers the virus. Rather than reinforcing the fact that science clearly shows our bodies have no natural immunity to Covid-19, it insinuates that our immune systems will simply and naturally adapt to it. But as proven from numerous and irrefutable examples (eg, smallpox, the 1918 flu pandemic), this simply does not play itself out in practice. She serves up ""heard immunity"" as a comforting mirage. But Sweden is a prime example of the opposite. It wasn't an emblem of heard immunity, it was an emblem of heard death. Yet her appealing and compellingly served up messages are simplistic enough to capture the interest of those who don't want to look at the tough questions--or what it takes to make our way through responding to those questions."
2020-05-21 01:18:43,"We are regressing back at least a hundred years.

Remember the Scopes ""Monkey Trial""? That was 1925. That was a major turning point when America roundly rejected superstition (and the retrograde forces that rely on superstition for their power) - and embraced Science.

After all, America was now a ""modern"" nation.  Most Americans had a radio in the living room and a Model T in the driveway. Most Americans read a newspaper every day. Most Americans were convinced that Science was the future.

Now half of Americans love their smart phones and the internet, but they equate Science with ""elitism"". They embrace the fruits of Science while rejecting the intellectual discipline required to harness Science. This is not a sustainable state of affairs.

If you're not familiar with the 1960 film ""Inherit the Wind"" (starring Spencer Tracy and based on a Broadway play of the same name) - it's a wonderful time machine for going back 95 years to witness the Scopes Trial. While the story line is somewhat fictionalized, the dialogue in many of the courtroom scenes is taken verbatim from transcripts of the actual trial.

I first discovered this film gem four decades ago. My reaction back then was, ""I had no idea America was so in thrall to superstition just fifty years ago. Thank goodness the rational side prevailed.""

Now I wonder, ""If this trial were held today, which side would prevail?""

Find ""Inherit the Wind"" online and give it a spin. You'll think it's 1925 all over again.

These folks don't rally to  the Capitol to protest roll backs on regulations that poisons the water, and kills children; or allows pesticide companies to use chemicals that damage children's brains; or coal companies that put toxins in the air that cause asthma and other conditions. 

This antivax effort started with a discredited doctor in England who used poor scientific methods to make a case for parents who were devastated by their childrens autism and wanted someone to blame. This doctor had patented separate measles, mumps and rubella shots and stood to make a lot of money by raising fears that the MMR caused autism, which it does not. He lost his license and was hailed a hero in the US. Some Americans think he stood up to power and told the 'truth' even after it was revealed there was a conflict of interest. 

It makes sense now that this group has somehow integrated with the 'open up the country ' and the 'you can't make me to wear a mask' groups. Each had the juvenile sentiment of hating being told what to do, and frail egos fighting for the right to be, and stay, ill informed. 

The antivax movement is NOT here to save the children. Far more children will become sick or die from rollbacks on environmental regulations than any 'harm' from the MMR."

I've taken the punitive dismissal of the safe-vax proponents as a bunch of impossible anti-vaxxers for granted and deserved too, until I actually bothered to hear and scrutinize the side that's getting slandered, discredited, delegitimized and deported out of the acceptable public realm at every turn and corner by Big Pharma's paid thugs and lackeys. I discovered JFK Jr. is right up there with Bill McKibben at the Mount EnvironRushmore of environmental heroism.

I also second the well-reasoned and -founded argument by Dr. Joseph Mercola in his article The Smoking Gun Evidence SARS-Cov-2 Is an Engineered Virus. I can imagine there's quite some interest pushing to suppress the outing of the pandemic as a US bio weapon, as the whole world would morally claim an insane amount in damages.

To me the frantic pushback is a tell that it ain't random lunacy what Judy Minkovits is claiming in Plandemic. Except where she recommends ""the hydroxy"" she and Mikki Willis largely won me over to their perspective. They seem sincere and authentic.

They need to know how it was developed, what tissues and cells were used to grow it, and what ingredients are in the final product. Why are food products required to list ingredients but a vaccine- with a far more lasting effect than food - doesn’t come with a required list of ingredients? Whether or not Plandemic is all true or all false isn’t the same as asking this basic question."

Add to that the ability of foreign powers to manipulate content and we -our democracy - are in deep trouble.  The first amendment is a dangerous and precious tenet, but our forefathers  never could have conceived of the likes of Twitter and Facebook .

2020-05-21 14:36:25,"As a news literacy educator and scholar, this is abundantly clear: The ability to propagate misinformation widely through social media is a feature, of these platforms, not a singular fluke. Similar to the Coronavirus, we no longer can hope to contain it, but instead simply learn to live with it and attempt to avoid coming in contact with it. And when we do, we need to have the tools to mitigate its effects. 

I avoided watching the film until someone I trust asked for my opinion on it. And when I watched it, it was clear that it was full of claims, that yes, seemed somewhat plausible, but were all unsubstantiated. If those who watched it simply asked where the evidence to the claims in the video were, they’d see how shaky those claims are. In addition, the inclusion of random video clips that aren’t attributed to anyone and void of context would have been further red flags to the content. 

All that is to say that it’s crucial for people to take a critical eye towards media that they consume from these platforms, especially that which claims to the “the truth about...” that is driven by the questions that journalists use— “What is this? Who created it? How do they know this? What don’t they know?”"

Ms. Sensmeier, I feel your pain. And while I wouldn’t dream of comparing yogurt to bread, glorious bread, I can only get four Yoplait Greek whip yogurts at a time when I do a Walmart pickup order. I have to drive over an hour away just to have access to grocery pickup, and before the pandemic, I would get enough yogurts for a whole month in one trip.

Instead of investing in new technologies and facilitating the movement of workers to new employment, they either give handouts to their (already established) cronies, or pay businesses to maintain jobs. 

In the future, there will probably more need for pathway-smoothers and robot route planners that there will be for waiters and table runners. And, of course, a new kind of law enforcement, as larger and more valuable orders hit the road."

My school said that they would not reduce tuition because we have the same access. What about the library as a quiet place to study, or the free university gym?

Online learning is not going to happen at Oxford, and not only because it is for the upper classes by birth and wealth (it serves everyone who can get in, but that’s a subject for another day). The education of a traditional residential college is incompatible with mostly or half online learning.

The necessary intrusions on these young adults, faculty, administrators, cafeteria workers, etc., will result in a constant state of uncertainty.

By the time some has symptoms or tests positive they've already exposed dozens of residents.    

some schools are looking at having only upperclassmen on campus - they are more likely to live off campus or teh absence of underclassmen means they can spread out housing.    CA State schools will still have  all hands on classes in person (STEM) but you're on your own for housing.

2020-05-19 14:15:48,"Fever checks at universities (and at almost any kind of workplace or gathering place) are far from a panacea because many carriers of coronavirus are asymptomatic and will not have fevers.

Putting students in close quarters like dormitories and classrooms  is likely to lead to university-based hotspots, which in turn will tend to overload local hospitals and other health facilities since universities don’t usually have vacant spaces in which they can concentrate sick students.

While students and faculty will generally hate continuing with on-line learning, and parents will hate paying full tuition for on-line classes, resuming normal university life with dormitories and classrooms is very risky.

Cal State has the right idea, at least as far as the fall semester is concerned—continue on-line classes until return to campus can be shown to be safe for students, faculty and administrators."
2020-05-19 14:31:29,"It seems to me that colleges are more worried about their finances than about the risks to public health. 

How things would operate on campus is only one piece of the plan. What about the exposure and potential for spread at times like start and end of term, with parents and family coming and leaving after helping students move in/out; what about the various term breaks, at which students will travel back home to families after having been with hundreds of students, and then back again to campus from their homes? 

Are students going to be given a choice? If their college makes the risk-filled decision to open in the fall, will students be able to keep their academic standing and skip one or more terms, or continue them online? 

Reopening colleges is not something to be done without thinking of all these aspects."
2020-05-19 14:36:29,"Like Marty said, ""Unfortunately, this is an ""economic"" decision as so readily acknowledged by the hierarchy."" To understand what this means requires understanding some of the code colleges and universities use. One could reasonably substitute ""student retention"" for ""student experience."" Higher education, especially the schools without substantial financial endowments to rely on in tough times, are much like small and medium businesses on main street that are dependent on monthly revenues because they're tuition dependent. These cracks in higher education, the un-sustainability of it, were apparent before the pandemic. If I was a parent, I would steer my child to either take a gap year and learn more about themselves and/or a state school offering cheaper tuition where they could pick-up some credits at a reduced rate that would transfer into the foundation courses that they would take at the school of their  choice e.g. college composition, psychology, communications, etc. A call to the school of interest ahead of time about what classes to take and a statement that they would transfer in, (course equivalents,) would be wise. On the other side of the story, many colleges schools just can't afford to not have students come back, much like so many in our our ""essential"" workforce.

That won’t easily take place when we are all required to maintain a distance of six feet. My day on campus will be much more about the intricacy of trying to interact while limiting interaction than it will be about anything else. Furthermore, lengthening the class day or class week interferes with my availability for work, making me less desirable for part-time jobs that are supposed to pay my tuition. Learning from home also cuts down on my commuting costs, and at this point in time more than any other in my academic career, every penny saved counts. I’ve been in the service industry since I was 17 and there are no more restaurant jobs for me to go back to, so if and when I find a part-time job, I’ll be making significantly less. My plan for paying for college has changed and so has my budget. 

I also value seeing my established, rock solid support network - my family and best friends of years - during this time more than ever. And I don’t want to get them sick. I have been extremely diligent and have not seen ANYONE except for my family and my roommates since March. For their safety, if I returned to campus, I would not see them."
2020-05-19 15:17:38,My kids will go back to college even if classes are still held on-line. Better for all of us if they do that than take their on-line classes here at home.
2020-05-19 15:20:09,"18,000 faculty and staff for 30,000 students? It is not suurprising that these numbers were followed by others illustrating the university's financial troubles. Unchecked bureaucracies bloat, and the result is unsustainable tuition and costs.

Maybe they could add a 4th group, ""team worm"", to study delaying the entire academic year by one semester. Run Spring and Summer, not Fall & Spring. This may buy enough time for a vaccine or treatment or a great reduction in risk in addition to avoiding the start of flu season. It also avoids planning a host of contingency plans, policies and enforcement mechanisms, which would likely lead to hiring still more staff or consultants to implement.

No one wants to pay full rate tuition for a half-baked college experience, and no employer will trust results from online classes unless legally obligated to. If college cannot happen at the usual time and place, it is a lot less disruptive to make a small shift in time instead of a giant disruption of place."
2020-05-19 15:32:06,"I was surprised to read this entire article and not once encounter any attempt to quantify the actual risk that students in the 17-25 age range will be hospitalized or will die from COVID-19 if one assumes that a university experiences an outbreak in the student body (which likely will be mostly assymptomatic).  Is it 1 in 1000? 1 in 10,000?  Depending what the risk is, perhaps it's not worth bothering with social distancing and masks on campus.  Or maybe it is, but how is no one involved in these discussions attempting to quantify the real risk of infection in this age group, or to put that risk in the context of lots of risks that are already accepted as part of campus life?"
2020-05-19 15:46:24,"I have taught as a university professor for 27 years. Pardon me if this sounds facetious, but I am getting the sense that the mindset that is developing is that as long as there is no vaccine and Covid-19 can linger in the human population, people will have to avoid each other for the foreseeable future.

Since when is that how human beings have managed with pervasive infectious and contagious diseases? I just did a bit of research. Written accounts of what is commonly known as influenza date back over 2000 years. The first flu vaccines were developed in the 1940s. Even as recently as the early 1960s researchers were trying to perfect a reliable vaccine against the seasonal flu. Up until that time, hundreds of thousands or even millions of people would die from the flu every year.

By today's standards of ""social distancing,"" previous generations of human beings were criminally negligent in the way they led their lives. I understand that Covid-19 is not the same thing as the flu. But if we apply the logic of the contemporary reaction to Covid-19, which is that every measure should be taken to protect people's health, no one should ever have attended college or university in person in the past.

And what if a cure for Covid-19 is discovered tomorrow? If the goal is to protect everyone's health, we *still* shouldn't allow in-person instruction because of the risk of *other* health-related dangers on campus.

Covid-19 has changed humans' thinking, and not for the better."
2020-05-19 16:17:14,"Apps to track illness or to be allowed into class?  You're going to rely on students to self-report any symptom and risk what they might think is a key class or lecture?  Sounds very optimistic to me.  After all, this is a population of people learning to be out on their own and in many cases learning to connive to get what they want - just think under-age drinking.

Then there's the problem of schools with large commuter populations..."
2020-05-19 16:18:25,"The comments here express a range of feelings but often fail to acknowledge that the current dilemma facing the university system is the result of the multi-decade degradation of public institutions (e.g. tax reductions). Higher education is part of the social contract committed to achieving great feats. Unfortunately, prevailing attitudes by those focused on short term gains have tilted the role of education towards a commodity. Moreover, this entire article illustrates how the administrations devalue the contributions and commitment of faculty and staff. The expertise and capacity to convey difficult concepts is what academics do best (for better or worse). 

Finally, not all that attend college will design the next vaccine to ward off the next pandemic but you can be sure that such feats will not happen without higher ed. Education and the associated academic research enterprise is an investment. So my real question is can you MAGA without higher education?"
2020-05-19 14:39:07,"It is certainly no surprise that “many professors [] were reluctant to return,” especially older ones who might also be obese, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or other medical problems which place them at extraordinarily high risk of death or permanent disability, or at least of prolonged hospitalization if forced to teach in classrooms.

Moreover, such especially vulnerable faculty have legal rights to be protected from these life-and-death risks posed by teaching in classrooms, even with testing, mandatory masks, attempts at social distancing, etc. 

So now is the time for them to tell administrators planning for the next academic year of their intent to assert these rights by filing formal complaints under the Americans With Disabilities Act [ADA], state and local anti-discrimination laws, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

2020-05-19 15:14:25,"It's hard to imagine much ROI on such ridiculous scenarios. Why not cut your losses? On the other hand, it's hard to imagine a quick exit to this situation. Perhaps the industry needs to evolve immediately. Behavior change takes a LONG time, though, and you will see deaths resulting from any scenario that brings people together in the fall. I'd love to see representatives of university staff who work directly with students involved in these discussions, not just administrators in offices with ""gleaming oval conference tables."""
2020-05-19 15:29:32,"A lot of commenters are missing the important point that in deciding whether to reopen a university the paramount goal should be to protect the health and lives of the university’s students, faculty and workers.

It has been amply demonstrated that coronavirus is readily transmitted in enclosed spaces like classrooms, dormitories, auditoriums, restaurants (cafeterias), gyms, offices, etc. 

There is currently no cure or vaccine for Covid-19, so trying to reestablish a semblance of normal university life is to some degree placing at risk those who occupy and use a university and its facilities.

Would I want my child to attend a university this fall? No. Would some other parents feel otherwise? Probably. I am sure most students would prefer to get back to campus.

However, I wonder what the universities’ insurance companies think about all of this, since universities that open for business this fall are clearly placing their constituents at some increased degree of risk. Also, if there are substantial spikes in  coronavirus cases on campuses this fall I would expect to see a flurry of related lawsuits."
2020-05-19 15:43:08,"I appreciated the view into the university’s deliberations, but I was struck throughout the article by the very basic and unimpressively low level of the discussion.  It sounded like something you would hear on a Zoom call of a bunch of random ppl with their opinions. Where is the data, the science, the expertise? It is frightening if this discussion is representative of how decisions are being made and scenarios are being thought through in schools wrestling with the decision throughout the country.  We can certainly do better."
2020-05-19 16:04:06,"It is a fair bet that the regents of the University System of Georgia will require everyone to return to campus. Students, faculty, and staff will become guinea pigs. It is also a fair bet that the regents will avert their eyes when infection rates increase. It will be much harder for them to ignore piles of bodies although Governor Kemp has done his best to do so to date. The colleagues with whom I have spoken are afraid especially given that many of us are a bit older or have health conditions. 

I will be interested to see if Georgia ""requires"" students to wear masks. My syllabi will have a mask policy - no mask, no class simple as that. I tolerated Georgia's inane concealed carry policy in college classrooms figuring the chances of one of my students shooting up the place were slim. The current situation is very different."
2020-05-19 15:13:23,"As the end of the article says, take all the on campus precautions you want, and then students will cram into bars and frat parties after hours.

And most of the 55000 students aren’t even here."

2020-05-19 17:43:04,"Academic institutions must offer deferrals and leaves to students when they cannot safely offer the programs students applied for or enrolled in. It is unfair to ask a 19 year old to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to prop up the school under these circumstances. The choices and economics are terrible for schools, but it is unconscionable to shift the risk and burden to young people for whom college debt is a life sentence even when they do get the educational experience they are paying for."
2020-05-19 17:47:19,"Many parents are hoping that their college-age children will return to campus in order to “resume their adult lives.”  For many decades, I have listened to young people admitting that their behavior during the four years of undergraduate life was not serious, and shamefully indulgent in many cases.  I would like to see more journalism about the current views on the necessity of four years of undergraduate school before narrowing study.  Yes, life lessons are often learned, but life lessons are learned among those who actually live adult lives after eighteen and do not prioritize protracted partying (obviousIy there are many exceptions).  I think now is the time we rethink much of the societal structure that is outmoded, but I have nothing but anecdotal evidence to support this opinion re: a four-yr. degree.

2020-05-19 18:01:15,"Thank you. This is a fascinating article and I am grateful to this university for opening their meeting to a reporter.
Of course, it is the epidemiologist who urges caution and encourages a focus on remote learning. I too have a college student at home, as well as a high school freshman, and I am here to tell you ""remote learning"" is unsustainable. These students MUST go back to campus, in the interest of total harm minimization.
It is very easy for epidemiologists to speak from their very narrow lens of public health outcomes solely as morbidity and  mortality from contacting the coronavirus. It is disappointing they don't integrate other considerations into their comments and recommendations. Honestly, as a science trained person, it makes scientists look bad and doesn't help the case for science-based decision making when epidemiologists choose this oversimplified and out of touch approach. Not to mention, Dr. Fauci told us not to wear masks, before he changed his mind. Good thing my science training taught me that humans are fallible and to think about what I am hearing. My family all started wearing masks right away, despite of Dr. Fauci's baseless recommendation."
2020-05-19 17:46:57,"I work for a university and I have SO many concerns. In no particular order: 
1. I worry about the effect of our re-opening on the surrounding community. We are not in a major metro-urban area. One ill advised frat party and we we will completely overwhelm community health re-sources. 
2. I worry about students for whom on-campus housing was their housing; or their only stable housing. 
3. I worry for our research students. You can't do most research online.
4. I worry about all staff and faculty. Our moment of health or job but probably not both is rapidly approaching. 
5. If we have an outbreak what happens to students who can't safely go home? We can't put students in a position of being homeless for the winter or potentially killing their parents. The models all assume we have to be done by November, but what if it's burning through campus on Sept. or Oct? We can't send them home safely. 
6. I worry that students are going to be profoundly unhappy no matter what we do. It isn't the education part as much as the social / community aspect. That can't be created right now; period. 60 year old professors can't walk across campus with you now - oh and no office hours that are face-to-face. The current model isn't sustainable but I don't think the new models are really, either. And the economic effects of several schools going under will be absolutely real and very painful."
2020-05-19 18:01:32,"I can’t get around the uncertainty of even a modified opening plan without fast, accurate testing done at the universities’ expense. And testing done frequently, perhaps even daily, but certainly scattered throughout the ~14-day incubation period that’s the current understanding of this virus’s behavior."
2020-05-19 17:12:10,All I can say is I am really glad I don't work in higher ed. This is not going to end well.
2020-05-19 18:04:28,"There is no such thing as a safe on-campus experience. Have you ever seen meningitis rip through a freshman dorm? You're kidding yourself if you think one-way sidewalks on the quad are solving anything. The primary dorm at my college was a 13 story high rise with double and triple occupancy filled to capacity and sometimes more. All with shared bathrooms. You might as well call the building the ""Towering Inferno"" during pandemic. It's that big of a hop spot."
2020-05-19 15:32:48,"As someone who recently graduated, if you think schools will be able to stop 18-21 year olds from partying, playing drinking games, sharing cups, experimenting with drugs together, goofing off or playing sports, and hooking up, you are a complete idiot. Administrators need to comprehend that brining school back to campus, no matter how many phony precautions you set up, is still bringing school back to campus."
2020-05-19 20:24:04,"We need to draw a distinction between colleges embedded in cities and colleges that have a separate campus that can be  isolated from the outside world. Opening the former would be risky simply because it would drastically increase the number of social interactions. The main problem is a student getting the virus and taking it back to where they live and infecting the more vulnerable. But the latter, colleges with a separate campus, offers a different experience. When I think about them I see that most concerns here are unfounded due to the application of the same standard of risk to the whole population. A college is not a hospital and doesn't need to try to create a similar climate. The main COVID-19 risk group is those over 65 and those with other health issues. The overwhelming majority of 18-22 is not in the risk group. So,  
-college students with pre-existing health issues should stay home and colleges should offer distance learning for them. 
-all the rest can go back. They can socialize and party as much as they want on campus provided that they have their fun on campus and when they leave the campus they social distance. The worst that'll happen is sort of a herd immunity and as long as students follow safety protocols everyone will be fine.   
-develop measures to protect the professors and staff from the students,
-test, trace, and isolate. All of these could easily be done on campus. 
Again, all this applies to colleges with a separate campus."
2020-05-19 22:06:15,Can there be some discussion about international students?  How will study visas be impacted?  How does one get a study visa if borders are not open?  Can a student enter and quarantine before they begin their studies?  What about work permits for students?
2020-05-19 22:09:02,"Higher education does what it does best: overreact and fail to act at the same time. There is no clear way forward because the future is at present unknown. Open early? Or late? Continue with only online classes(Harvard)? Hybrid classes? How about no school at all? If public schools open on time in most places why would colleges not do the same? How about the military bases in the U.S and outside? Do they not face the same issues as college campuses? Dorms--yes crowded housing, but there is crowded housing other than college dorms--how will these places differ? What drives colleges is the fear that there is not going to be a level playing field and the fear that other colleges will be able to gain an advantage and steal away students. For NYC colleges who have already stated they will be back to normal in the Fall--even when the state or city has yet to state what requirements will be in place for late summer or fall--is wishful thinking. Of course, not all colleges will be affected in the same manner even those in NYC area. Not all classes can take place online. For example, science Labs, clinical classes, etc. Maybe this is the time to do away with the very idea of a uniform semester for all courses and students---the article suggested that one can have only some students on campus for shorter periods of time--Quarters rather than semesters and spread out throughout the year. A 2 semester academic year seems very outdated. Colleges need to think outside the box."
2020-05-19 20:00:48,"I'm a professor at a large state university in the midwest that ""plans"" to open in the fall. The prospect of trying to get dozens of students in and out of the one door that leads into my badly-ventilated classroom without crowding, and making them keep masks on for an hour and a half, seems preposterous. I can't even get them to take their ear buds out or put their phones away. How am I going to enforce this if I encounter resistance from a belligerent student? Call the Provost to come in and lay down the law? I don't think he's going to help me.

That is not how this disease has played out. Stop with the some young people get sick thing. Yes, and some young people get other serious diseases, but we dont plan higher education around it.

Harvard Medicine is in the same boat. It amounts to Higher Ed privilege. Just because these institutes made investments in digital delivery, and understand the risk of turning into COVID-U, doesn't mean they should be given an advantage. 

Personally, I think we should treat this like the 2008 crash. In other words, ALL institutes should be forced to open in the fall, just like ALL banks were pushed to accept a bailout in '08 - to mask which banks had acted the most irresponsibly. If we stand together, we'll fall together. No one should be allowed to stand up and say ""we didn't kill our students and staff through idiocy and greed."" It's just a bad look. Shame on Cal State and Harvard Med for exercising their intellectual privilege. SHAME!"

I am surprised at the comments here and how self-focused they are; especially comments from professors.  It makes more sense to make special accommodations for at risk faculty and staff than it does to further disrupt the lives of so many students who are at very, very little risk.  If a professor is in the high risk category he/she can stand behind a shield in front of the class (like all the grocery workers do, who make far less), or they can require masks in their classroom, or take an early paid sabbatical."

Her college has already announced that almost all programs are online through December 2020--all of Fall term. A few selected classes (nursing, labs, welding, etc.) are in person with distancing precautions. It's not ideal. I'd love for her to go back to campus and see her classmates, work with professors directly, see her friends, and get out of the house. But the virus doesn't care what I want. I think it's telling that a low-cost college that isn't over-extended financially made the decision weeks ago to have almost everything online for the fall."
2020-05-19 23:14:15,"*sigh* Where to even begin with this one? As a college student, I would love nothing more than to wake up from this nightmare and return to fall classes on campus. Unfortunately, as another student mentioned, what’s the point if the entire experience will be flipped on its head? I’m actually uniquely struggling with the idea of another remote semester, because I was supposed to study abroad for the upcoming academic year. Everything from visa processing to passport renewal has been a bit of a challenge. Study abroad administrators and program advisors are telling students to continue submitting and working on their documents, but to have a contingency plan for the fall semester. It’s seems like a lot to handle for students, physically and monetarily. My passport renewal was necessary (it was set to expire this June) but my U.K visa is not, and it’s quite costly. If classes are cancelled, I won’t be receiving that money back. In the end, it just seems like either way there’s going to be a loss. Returning to campus and putting students and faculty at risk (not to mention, returning to campus and then having to quickly switch to remote learning due to an outbreak) doesn’t seem like a good idea, particularly while being abroad. But then, continuing remote learning and leaving students who have been planning for their study abroad for a year (almost as much as I would be staying there), out in the dust, would also brings its own consequence."
2020-05-19 22:54:57,Let's face it.  It's all about the money. There are enough unemployed PhDs to replace the professors who get sick and die of Covid or who become totally disabled and can't work.  The administrators and deans don't have to work face to face with the kids so they'll be safe.  I live near a college town and I will not step foot in it until this is over that is for sure.  I feel sorry for the healthcare workers who work in these areas as they will also be exposed.  Money rules.
2020-05-19 14:40:50,"I choose the peace of mind of being able to see my family safely over being able to try and establish new ones with social distancing.

The last major reason is that faculty and staff must be given the same consideration as students. They are also humans. What jobs can happen remotely should, including teaching. Some of my past professors and tutors became my mentors, whom I respect and care for. One has diabetes. Another recently had a child. I fretted over spring break, hoping my college would cancel in-person classes for their sake, knowing students would be coming back from spring break from who-knows-where with who-knows-what."
2020-05-19 14:16:58,"For many students the home environment is not conducive to learning. Campuses give even commuter students alternative spaces, such as libraries, where they can hunker down and study.

2020-05-20 00:05:24,"18-22 yr olds are going to mingle and socialize in significant numbers in the fall whether they are living at college, home or independently.  It is not possible to stop them from doing so for long periods of time short of a full-on, authoritarian police state level lock down.  Prohibition will look like a big success compared to any attempt to quarantine this age group for more than a few weeks.  This reality, together with the data indicating that severity and mortality rates are very low (although still greater than zero) for people in their teens and early 20's should be taken in account, along with the other valid and serious concerns mentioned in the article.  

Perhaps the focus should be on steering away from high transmission events (like not permitting crowds to gather in large numbers, holding large lecture hall type classes online, etc.), maintaining safe physical distance from faculty and administration and others at a higher risk and preparations for targeted interventions to more surgically address any flare ups.  For the Fall semester, schools have some time to plan, some experience and some meaningful data to weigh (luxuries they did not have in February and March).

Shutting down schools for another semester would be a very high cost intervention that will cause serious damage to the educational ecosystem, with the most vulnerable communities suffering terribly.  Not something we should take lightly.

And all those young people are still going to mingle."
2020-05-20 02:26:24,"NYU is going to go on campus in person learning in the fall. Good for them. I admire the creativity, effort and commitment to inter generational equality.

So that means a whole year of home Zoom, plus the last quarter of this past academic year. What a shameful retreat into fear and hysteria."

I’m not sure how TAing undergraduate courses will go. How can I feel safe in a small room leading discussion with undergraduates who may have been out with friends or family the night before, or otherwise exposed? If we’re online, how to engage students while at home, some of whom have difficult family situations, lack of access to tech, or a host of other issues?

What about the intellectual arguments over coffee or beers, the thrill of finally meeting kindred spirits after the intellectual desert of high-school, the camaraderie of discussing important ideas as well as sharing information on bad (and good) professors? What abut the terror of speaking in class and the thrill of finally being able to do it in a way that reveals an inner quality you never knew you had? 

All that is destroyed when you try to synthesize the university experience by turning it into a computer program. Maybe everyone doesn’t have a great college experience, but with a shift to e-learning, it won’t be possible for anyone."
2020-05-20 09:57:31,"No more large lectures.  How complete requirements?
What about dorm life? How safe distance there?"
2020-05-20 10:46:00,"The part of this I struggle with is how we can run a campus under a “test trace isolate” program. Given the Cornell study on the vast network overlap students have with each other and faculty being exposed to dozens/hundreds of students as well as fellow faculty, how long before faculty have to isolate for two weeks because a student is infected? How often will we be finished with a 2-week isolation only to return to a new one a week later?  Or do we not isolate if we were in the same room for an hour but six feet away?  I just don’t understand the plan."
2020-05-20 11:57:29,"The human behavior change to flatten the curve is unprecedented. 
Politicians/leaders who believe it was the result of educated choice will make very different decisions than those who believe that they must dictate behavior. The former will celebrate and reward it. The latter will take credit for it. 
Many students and parents believe that the college experience they are paying for goes beyond what students learn in the classroom. Specifically, they value a safe oasis to develop the critical thinking and independent judgement to make educated choices."
2020-05-20 12:15:12,"The University of Kentuck'y process and ideas are impressive. What occurs to me is that at some point, a university's responsibilities are fulfilled and students have to take up their own.  Lessons in discipline and accountability have high value in themselves.  What if returning students were required to sign a contract committing to meeting the school's rules - one with a zero-tolerance policy.  Students violating safety rules would be out, period.  No refunds, no credits, no welcome back.  It's harsh, yes, but might be part of the missing link in realizing that we are all in this together."

2020-05-20 12:12:07,"I am thrilled to read this type of thinking.  I was walking in my town a month ago on the beach/boardwalk and saw smiling families enjoying themselves.  I mentioned ""this is the most fun end of the world I have ever seen"".   I feel that (especially) cable TV(I don't watch fox) CNN, MSNBC were very content to show segments of people enjoying self at home, working from home(I know many doing it and most just respond to emails and (rare) phone calls and go walking, gardening, biking etc.  We can't pay people 100k(many I know making this) to work 2-3 hrs a way in company or school with non existent business or learning. I am a substitute teacher(retired from IT) and put in 3 hrs a day tops giving science class, correcting on line test(and I had to put together a lesson plan..it would be less if I had one).  The country is dynamic and needs people buying/fixing cars, installing solar, running restaurants, cutting hair.  Much of it is very inefficient but inefficeinty is what creates jobs.  College has taken it on the chin with so many questioning its value but 3 million are EMPLOYED by college  and 20 million enrolled.  It is the focal point of so many cities large and small and has to be re started or the risk is huge closings with unemployment etc.  Believe me there are many ""start ups"" like Coursera would would be happy to have everyone learning from home putting 2.5 million of the 3 million out of work and rendering the campus worthless. 95% of what they teach is coding."
2020-05-20 12:37:00,"This is going to be a disaster this fall, both for public schools and for higher education.  If public schools reopen, those elementary classes are going to be incubators for all those children who have no immunity to the virus, and then they will take it home to parents and grandparents.  Universities and colleges will have their own incubators (e.g., sororities, fraternities, clubs, etc.).  I predict that of the schools that open, most will be closed well before Thanksgiving.  I think this would be a great time for a significant number of students to consider alternatives to the traditional college year, such as internships or public service.  For instance, how about a year restoring the crumbling infrastructure of our national parks?  I am thinking, how many parents of college students are going to be comfortable with their children taking the risk of enrolling in on campus classes, and then potentially exposing their parents and grandparents on their return, which may well be an unscheduled return?"
2020-05-20 12:29:17,"Face masks in dining halls??? Are the students being fed intravenously???

Residence halls are petri dishes under the best of circumstances. The only way to ensure a safe learning experience is to radically change the housing, dining, classroom and library protocol. Athletic & social events must be banned.

Anything less than these minimum safety protocols are proof that universities are only concerned about their bottom line."

But when you go out to eat....no one's out. Places that are still only doing take out seem to be more crowded and better off than the open sit down restaurants. Now that restaurants are open, I have to marvel at how little money they must be making. Places that are generally bustling and busy seat one to four parties of small groups when their dining areas used to be packed. Staff is being paid, fresh and perishable food is on hand, and utilities, delivery services, etc must surely be leaving restaurants in the red each day. Service is awesome! Wait staff is pleasant and chatty. But how is anyone making money?? 

I guess the hope is volume picks up....so staff just sits around until then making pennies to their former dollars for weeks on end? ...looks bleak from here. And we're in a very affluent area relatively untouched by Corona. Yet we have digital billboards with ""stay home"" PSA's, and a public who obviously prefers not to be dining out. Home parties are on the rise. But if a wealthy southern Republican suburb is choosing to still stay in, best wishes to returning restaurant staff anxious to work. It appears it may be a longer road to normalcy than even the most optimistic think."

2020-05-19 13:12:53,"Let's be clear about US funding for the WHO. America is supposed to pay 'membership fees' of $119 million annually. That's actually less than the EU countries pay ($129 million). The total operating budget of the WHO is $510 million, that's all, for WHO services including pandemic surveillance and response. Not a lot, especially as the US has been in default of those payments for three years!

The rest (81% of total) comes from governments, NGOs and private charitable bodies which donate for specific projects they wish to undertake. The US is the largest contributor of these one-off 'earmarked' payments (15%) - the British and German governments, the European Union, the Gates Foundation and the Global Vaccine Alliance are other major donors.

What Trump fails to understand is that the US has, in cash terms, a modest contribution to the functioning of the WHO and that 'withdrawing funds' will primarily affect the 'special projects' of US universities, American academics and US suppliers."
2020-05-19 15:27:53,"Unpleasant things can happen to a country when it decides to not stay at the table. Just ask the former USSR at the beginning of the Korean War. It is because it decided to protest and to not attend the special session of the Security Council that it was not able to veto the intervention of the UN in the conflict in 1950, with the end result we know. The USSR never missed a session after that blunder. Yes, the issue is not the same but the consequences of such an action had not been correctly taken into account, as it could be the case if the USA leaves the WHO."
2020-05-19 15:40:47,"Trump's approach to this is so short sighted. Many of the developing world have some of the same problems as China. China may be #2 right now but gdp per capita is still relatively low. At best it is a middle income country. You have many countries in SE Asia, Africa etc that have similar if not worse wet markets and worse alerting systems and infrastructure. The pandemic response is undoubtedly going to be worse than China's even with the initial coverup. These countries need the likes of the W.H.O. and is relatively sympathetic to China's position. So now you have China championing the W.H.O when the developing world need it the most while Trumps walks away from it. These countries are some of the most promising new markets in the next half century..."
2020-05-19 18:24:39,"Trump is giving China exactly what it wants. The reason China spends so much money and resources to influence international organizations is because it is after America’s seat at the head of table, along with all the influence that seat carries. Trump’s idea of “hitting back” is to storm off, giving up the seat to China. The US has set the world’s agenda for so long that we take it for granted. But if we continue on this path, we’ll see what it’s really like to be isolated and encircled."

Can someone in the medical community explain why anyone take an unapproved medication because he might contract something despite the list of side effects? I might contract the flu, should I take a ZPac? I might get herpes, should I take Acyclovir? I might get strep throat, should I grab some penicillin? And so on. What responsible doctor would prescribe it? The only logical explanation to me is that Trump tested positive and he is trying to prevent the onset of symptoms.  Would love a full article on this. In any event on the surface it appears dangerous and idiotic without a deeper explanation."
2020-05-19 15:56:25,"What I find maddening is that Trump is trying to undo everything which made the USA “great” in the past. The US was at the summit of its economical and moral power when it sponsored all these institutions. Now its relative economical power has shrunk (that’s normal with so many countries industrializing and the other ones having recovered from the waste of WW2) and its moral leadership is a joke in the world (it certainly didn’t have to be that way).

Investigators must be communists and swear an oath of fealty to Beijing.  Any reports must be previewed and authorized by the CCP.  Add this to Xi’s Five No No’s. 

That lead investigator will be by the WHO."
2020-05-19 17:09:46,The WHO should investigate why China stopped air travel from Wuhan within China but allowed air travel from Wuhan internationally for another two weeks.

It isn't about China. That is why both sides feel free to say whatever is useful against the other, without regard to their own past or even present policy preferences toward China.

Strategy to be defiant will be counter productive and cause mistrust of China. Travel restrictions on China will continue for a long time. China will suffer trade  and China will no longer be able to keep the gains of being a leader on the world scene. 

8 things China needs to do and do it fast.
1) Apologize to the world in the UN for the deaths and economic devastation caused by the virus that escaped from its territory.
2) Give up the permanent member status for failing to nip COVID-19 in the bud.
3) Compensate the world for the cost incurred due to damage caused by the spread and deaths of COVID-19. 
4) China had the heads up on the COVID-19 crisis and could mass produce masks, ventilators, sanitizers, thermometers and even a vaccine against COVID-19 and it can make enough money to forgive loans of countries going bankrupt like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Kenya and more.
5) Recognize Taiwan and Tibet as independent countries and give up the idea of a ""One China"".
6) Restore autonomy of Hong Kong.
7) Leave wild animals in the wild and shut down wet markets.
8) Stop Flexing its muscles in the South China Sea."
2020-05-19 21:42:02,"One cannot help but see the pattern indicating that Trump is looking to aid the spread of covid-19.  He has said it's no big deal, just like the flu.  He has obstructed the ability to make testing supplies and PPE domestically.  He has encouraged armed vigilante groups to gather and advocate reopening the economy.  And now he's picking more trade wars with the key exporter of supplies needed to fight the epidemic.  We still don't see any stockpiling of supplies for phase 2.  If it's anything like phase 1, there were big bait and switch games ... sure we'll send you supplies next week ... oh no supplies?  We'll send them next week ... oh no supplies?  And the other tune - we'll have plenty of tests, everybody will have tests.  

Through all this, Trump has demonstrated increasing levels of being terrified of the virus himself.  He instituted testing of every person who came into the same room, demanded social distancing, and now we find he is taken unproven prophylactics in a mystical attempt to fend off the virus.  

The contrast between the private behavior and the public cheerleading could not be greater.  Which is it, Mr. Trump?  What's good for the goose should be good for the gander, or oh right - some are more equal than others."

As we know world has limited resources and we have to live and compete for these.
Formerly populations reduced by the wars or  pandemics.
Wars were ineffective since the world war-II.
From 100 year there is no big pandemic for human who threat seriously so this is the formula to do that.
because we have to live with limited resources.
and the earth cannot be over weighed."
2020-05-20 07:40:46,"Trump is upset because he knows that the wording of the WHO decision is broad enough to look into his own lack of real action in the first couple of months this year (dates are tough since his alleged shutting of the borders against China had more verified holes than Swiss cheese).  Naturally, a truly ""independent"" investigation should do just that, look at all nations' responses (or not), not just China or Brazil or Russia or Belarus or Britain or the US.

While these results are promising, I think more information is needed.  What would convince me is if there are results, originating from a Phase III randomized controlled, blind trial, showing not only the vaccine is safe, but that it’s capable of inducing the production of antibodies in high enough titers to confer immunity.  In my opinion, I believe we are not months, but perhaps a year at best, away from seeing this.

Additionally, I don’t see too many in the Trump Administration discussing how production will be scaled up, how it will be disseminated, and how many inoculations will be needed.  Will one be sufficient? Who get’s immunized first?  What is the plan on all of these things?  

I know this administration is hyping Operation Warped Speed.  Yet, this seems like more “happy talk” from this administration that I heard in the early phases of this pandemic.  I wish people in this administration would level with the American public and tell us that having a vaccine in 6 months is the goal, yet is highly unlikely to happen, that we somehow need to find a way to function in a situation where the virus is endemic.  

So far, I haven’t heard anything about how we open our economies gradually and safely, to control the spread.  There may be a few voices who are willing to manage the expectations of the American public, but they’re being minimized."
2020-05-18 15:02:35,"It's hard to be more positive with a study of 8 people.  And their accelerated program is working about as quickly as is possible, short some miracle.
This is the fastest anyone should expect the creation of a safe and effective vaccine to happen. Promising results and real science are infinitely better than insanely optimistic cheerleading, focused more on driving next quarter's profits than saving American's lives."
2020-05-18 15:05:59,"Let me get this right. They had total of 8 people and 3 of them were on high dose. That means that they concluded that low dose is safe and effective enough based on 2 or 3 samples.

Desperate time calls for desperate measures, I guess. They must've compressed phase 0 and 1 into one. They would've had more than 8 people to divide up into three groups if they had more confidence on safety.  The risk of course is that the dose will turn out to be either not effective or not safe in larger trials.

Let's just hope that the trials will go well without casualty or hitch. We all need it to succeed."
2020-05-18 15:06:41,"Good. It would be great if a mRNA vaccine would work, but it is important to remember that this is a cutting-edge and largely unproven technology. Also Moderna works under the assumption that their vaccine will come in 50 microgram doses, which is a lot, and 25 times as much as other companies think they will need.

But even if all works out as every sane person must hope, then the world still is defenseless against Covid-19 for at least another six months. And given the lack of patience everywhere and the lack of planning or even basic competence in the Trump administration, the US will probably not be able to avoid a catastrophic second wave of infections - no matter whether Moderna succeeds or not."
2020-05-18 15:07:28,"Yes, the technical hurdles are rife, as often happens, and commodification issues haunt most of US drug development, often placing the patent, not the patient, at heart of drug design and promotion. Yet this is preliminary but good news, accurately delivered in a carefully crafted article that refrains from promising too much while allowing us to savor a bit of long-awaited hopeful news. Well done!"
2020-05-18 15:12:02,"These results are positive but very very preliminary. In normal times, something tested on EIGHT people less than two months ago wouldn't even be reported. I think we all would love to see a vaccine this year. But I want to know it has been fully tested. I am not an epidemiologist and I have no idea what all those steps are. But in the rush to succeed, I hope we won't sacrifice all the necessary and time consuming steps to be sure the vast majority of the billion + people who will need it - young and old, healthy and not, those with kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, on different kinds of drugs, etc., - can all take this vaccine with a high degree of confidence. Anything else would just be a giant setback that will only make our current situation worse."
2020-05-18 15:16:25,"This is good news but preventing disease in human beings isn't the same as preventing the virus from infecting cells in a lab.  We have a long way to go.

These drug company executives are painting a rosy picture because they want the business.  The potential global sales will reach into the billions.  

Furthermore, as stated by the experts, once a vaccine is developed, we have to figure out how to reliably scale it up.  Then once we do that, we have to prove that it is stable in storage and transport.  What will be its shelf life before it goes bad?  All of these questions must be answered.

The logistics of distribution alone are enormous, especially since we have off shored most drug production.  The largest vaccine plant in the world is in India.

Myself, I don't expect to be able to get a shot before next summer.  What happens to us before then will be determined upon how well practice social distancing.  Yesterday, I was in  a huge home improvement store.  None of the staff that I could see were wearing masks.  The only men wearing masks were elderly.  Most all of the women were wearing masks.  Not a hopeful sign."
2020-05-18 15:20:47,"I recall the Thalidomide debacle.  The awful side effects didn’t start showing up for many months. I am tired of being at home and not with friends. But eight people and two months seem sketchy. I get that the subject vaccine is based loosely on previously studied vaccines. But I would not want to give any ammunition to the anti vaxxer / white nationalist crowd, and quick development followed by months-later manifestation of bad side effects could take us there."
2020-05-18 15:23:50,"8 people? That's not a study. We can do this safely, which does not appear to be the concern here, and let some biotech firm make huge $$ at the same time.  Further testing should be accomplished on WH staff first."
2020-05-18 15:23:59,"And how much did Dr. Zaks personally and financially benefit by making an aspirational statement about his publicly traded company, given that such an announcement about a potential coronavirus vaccine would almost surely created an upward surge in its stock price?"
2020-05-18 15:25:18,"Once this vaccine is proven safe, we need to do human challenge trials.  Ask for volunteers, screen them to ensure that they fully understand the risks involved, provide them with the best medical care possible in the event that they do become sick - though the hope, obviously, is that the vaccine will work and they will not fall ill - pay them handsomely for the risk they're taking, and raise them up as heroes.  The idea that allowing someone else to risk their life is some sort of a redline that can never be crossed is, frankly, a level of moralistic self-indulgence completely divorced from the reality of our current situation.  Do it right and we may save anywhere from thousands to millions of lives."
2020-05-18 15:26:11,"EIGHT test subjects?  Seriously, the stock market leaps on results from EIGHT people?  I am not an anti-vaxxer, but several years ago I had an adverse reaction to a vaccine which has been around for years, and the side effects lasted for 18 months.  I would never, ever trust a brand new vaccine that hadn't been tested in thousands of people.  Is it ethical for Moderna to publicize these results knowing that all that people will hear/see/read is that it appears to be safe to work, without realizing that it was tested on so few people.  I agree with everyone who mentions thalidomide...and all the other vaccines in the government's public adverse-reaction database."

Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Slaoui’s stock options in Moderna are worth more than $10 million with the company’s share price at $66.69. In pre-market trading Monday, Moderna’s stock soared as high as 30 percent to nearly $87.""
“Slaoui’s blatant financial conflicts of interest disqualify him for the role of vaccine czar, unless he commits immediately to global vaccine access conditions over the obvious profit interests of the corporations he serves,” said Peter Maybarduk, director of the Access to Medicines Program at Public Citizen.""

2020-05-18 15:26:37,"Given the very low success rate for developing new vacines the notion people - and stock markets - are going all gaga over this extremely early stage of development where 8 people are tested for a reaction is like betting your life savings you will win the grand prize on the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" game show  after only answering the first question right.

It is utterly absurd, driven in part by a sense of desperation for many, and the same kind of stupidity of others who mindlessly don't wear a mask or try to socially distance themselves (and some much more vile behavior driven by our political leadership).

Of course we hope a vaccine is developed, but such extreme reaction at this stage is more a reflection of mindless ignorance then rational response."

As the Northern hemisphere moves toward the summer solstice and the UV index begins to climb day after day and the length of the day increases the number of people testing positive for coronavirus is decreasing across the United States . MERS and SARS were destroyed by the intense UV light of Summer will the coronavirus be joining them? People have always made the mistake in assuming that it’s the heat of summer that kills influenza when it’s really the high UV index caused by the earths rotation to the sun , heat is just a byproduct of that .

This is the first piece of good news we have had in quite some time, and it is not from the Trump Administration, which means it can probably be believed.  No, we are not out of the woods.  Yes, it may turn out to be a ""false positive"".  But why squelch hope?  Being unduly negative about this development is just as unrealistic as being unduly positive.  The war has not been  won, but  a significant battle may have been.  We are entitled to at least a brief celebration!"
2020-05-18 15:14:07,"I am probably the last person to note the irony of Trump and his acolytes dissing science and the scientific method of trial and error research, while also pressing -- if not browbeating -- research labs and pharma companies to hurry up with developing an effective vaccine.

From a political point of view, it's like for Trump having your cake and eating it, too. Or, another way of looking at it is that Trump is a serial demagogue."

2020-05-18 15:32:08,"We’ll see.  My concern is the announcement of what sounds like very preliminary results will cause people to engage in reckless behavior.  Already I am reading about “light at the end of the tunnel.”  Given the hardships people are going through, and the tragic number of deaths in the United States, it’s understandable.  But we should not be quick to abandon the only measures thus far that have actually worked to reduce the spread:  face masks, social distancing, hand washing, and yes, closures and lockdowns.  Go slow.  So much still seems to be unknown about this coronavirus, including symptoms, age-related vulnerability, and in what form it may reappear.

I also think it would be wise to begin working on a plan for the orderly distribution of a vaccine, once one is found.  I had to wait for months before getting my second shingles shot and, as an elderly person, being on pharmacy waiting lists for that long was pretty concerning.  Healthcare workers and others on the frontlines, of course, should be a priority."

But I also find it a little suspicious that the vaccine being touted today is from the company that the newly appointed ""vaccine czar"" recently headed up. Although he resigned he still holds millions in stock options.  Further skepticism arises because other companies/projects around the world have also been working feverishly on a vaccine -- I find it a little ""odd"" that this particular US company is getting the publicity right now --as first.  Could it be for the ""bump"" in the stock market and/or to make people feel ""safer"" than they actually might be...perhaps to get the economy going...perhaps to influence elections?  If my skepticism turns out to be unfounded, great. But at this point it is based solidly on the corruption and dishonest/nefarious motivations this administration has demonstrated.

But nobody, not even Moderna itself,  wants it more than Trump. If this vaccine is approved by November, he wins the election in a landslide.

2020-05-18 15:23:27,"For those looking for a little more detail, yes, it IS preliminary - it's the first step in testing the effectiveness and safety.  There were actually 45 people in the study:
(quoting this article: <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-releases-first-human-trial-results-2020-5"" target=""_blank"">https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-releases-first-human-trial-results-2020-5</a> )
""This trial enrolled 45 healthy volunteers to start, ages 18 to 55 years old, and randomly gave one of three dose strengths for two shots: 25 micrograms, 100 micrograms, and 250 micrograms.

All participants developed detectable antibodies, and Moderna said there were ""dose dependent increases in immunogenicity"" across the three potencies.

There are 3 major hurdles it has passed so far, with many more to go:
1) It triggers antibodies in the blood in concentrations similar to COVID-19 survivors.
2) It was safe for the 45 people in the study.
3) The highest dosage will not be necessary, as it is no more effective than the intermediate dosage given in this study."
2020-05-18 15:36:45,"This trial is showing promising results. This buoys millions if not billions of people's hopes and prayers. 
But if this trial ends turns out ineffective or life-threatening? The dearth of promising results to date suggests a low probability of working. Not to be a downer, but most of us would admit that if an effective vaccine were relatively simple to uncover, wouldn't a virologist have coaxed it into the light months ago?
Humanity, and its stock market state of mind, must practice patient vigilance. We , if we don't we'll most likely drag ourselves thru dispiriting  cycles of joy and funk. Down the rabbit hole and out again exhausts us.

Katja Vogt's discussion of ancient skepticism in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is instructive:
The Greek word ""skepsis"" means investigation. By calling themselves skeptics, the ancient skeptics thus describe themselves as investigators. They also call themselves ‘those who suspend’ (ephektikoi), thereby signaling that their investigations lead them to suspension of judgment."

Or will I see ads during dinner time with smiling men and women in bathtubs while a cheerful woman reads a list deadly side effects?  American drug companies have to make a healthy profit to keep us alive, after all."
2020-05-18 15:40:15,So they verify that the vaccine is effective because it creates antibodies.  But the antibody tests available to us are not reliable. Please explain.

2020-05-18 14:22:28,"I work in infectious disease research, specifically with vaccines for HIV. While I am very, very excited about these results I find the sample size of eight people extremely worrisome - usually vaccine studies are in the hundreds across a number of sites (across a number of countries) for phase 1 studies. 8 people are not obviously representative of the broader human population and specifically, given the inclusion and exclusion criteria of healthy volunteers for phase 1 vaccine studies, for the high(er) risk population with pre-existing conditions. While I am still very hopeful about this, I hope that we will be able to thread the needle between the critical need for a vaccine and the unyielding imperative to do 'good science'. Hopefully data will be published about more than 8 patients but at this time I think the price jump in Moderna's stock is preemptive."
2020-05-18 15:42:00,"I will not get this or any vaccine until it has been used by general public for a year.
There is just too much that comes out when the general population uses it."
2020-05-18 14:15:47,"Good but very, very preliminary, news. In an observational (essentially) uncontrolled study there are many confounding factors. Also, note there has never been a successful vaccine used for any of the Corona virus diseases. Further there is concern that stimulating an immune response may trigger a cytokine storm. This is not to say that I won't be in line for the first commercially available vaccine."
2020-05-18 15:42:22,"I can’t figure out why no one—including the Times—is talking about the Swine Flu vaccination scenario of the 1970s, when thousands, perhaps millions, were inoculated. Campuses lined up their student populations, who received needle-free injections with vaccine guns. 

Negative side effects existed. One of the problems with the side effect mentioned in this article is that it is immediate, but some side effects are not so instantaneous. The Swine Flu vaccine caused Guillain-Barré syndrome, by way of an example. 

If any vaccine is developed, it is vital that the government agree to provide health care for anyone injured by side effects. That should be a condition on the liability shield that McConnell will want and one I would insist on if I were the manufacturer of any vaccine produced in these rushed circumstances. I would borrow from the Swine Flu vaccine makers’ playbook and refuse to make the vaccines available until a shield and provision for medical care had been enacted. 

People injured by the vaccine are being injured in the name of their fellow citizens and should be compensated. 

I wonder what Trump will do about the spurious claims of religious exemptions from the vaccines that will inevitably arise?  He can’t cure the virus and please his anti-vaxxer base at the same time!"
2020-05-18 14:49:50,"The level of negativity in these comments is disappointing.  This is phenomenally encouraging news.  Antibodies were created, side effects were manageable and a mouse model points towards efficacy.  There is more to learn with additional phases, but antibodies do not come out of nowhere - they were generated from an incredibly new and creative type of vaccine.

Let's smile a bit on this news today, as it has been so hard to do lately.  It's a great win for science and society in this battle.  Really smart people are making really great discoveries.  It could end up not working at anticipated, but let's focus on the positive at the moment.  Nothing negative to read about here."
2020-05-18 14:43:29,"Good news, though very preliminary. 

One thing to point out. If we really are this close to a vaccine, the herd immunity strategy looks particularly unjustifiable. A few more months of physical distancing and we can vaccinate the population, saving tens of thousands of lives that might otherwise have been sacrificed in pursuit of herd immunity."

Given Trump's credibility and trust problems, one must be extremely cautiously optimistic that an impatient Trump will resist turning Operation Warp Speed into Operation Warped Speed by claiming success as he did with hyroxychloroquine and even bleach before all the data on both safety and efficacy are available from the gold standard for assessing drugs, a randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT). Even then it would be important to hold other RCTs to see if the results are replicated, especially on a variety of populations like the elderly and people of color."
2020-05-18 15:47:03,"This is extremely positive.  Being on the frontlines diagnosing people with Covid, this is so encouraging.  Their method is novel and brilliant and could apply to many more emerging diseases.  If this works, they could rapidly make vaccines to new viruses as needed.  I do worry that we don't know much about the safety of this type of approach to vaccination but the fact that there are no serious side effects yet and that neutralizing antibodies were made is incredible!"

2020-05-18 15:50:35,"Based on reading the Moderna press release, it is clear that Moderna included more than 8 people in their study, which seems to be implied by the headline.  While Moderna doesn't say in the press release how many participated, they announced in a March 16 press release that the study would include 45 people.  

By one criteria, all participants showed positive immune responses, while for the other key criteria they only have data for 8 participants, all of whom showed a positive response.   Below are the key points on success under both criteria:

-- ""After two doses all participants evaluated to date across the 25 µg and 100 µg dose cohorts seroconverted with binding antibody levels at or above levels seen in convalescent sera""

-- ""mRNA-1273 elicited neutralizing antibody titer levels in all eight initial participants across the 25 µg and 100 µg dose cohorts, reaching or exceeding neutralizing antibody titers generally seen in convalescent sera"""

As others have said here, the testing is incomplete and we have repeatedly been told this is not going to be a quick process.    We will no doubt now have a declaration of success from the denier in chief who makes it up as he goes along, lurching from one remedy to another, all of them full of flannel."

When effective vaccines are finally discovered and globally administered, one has to ask what will be the price charged to recipients? For example, Gilead Biosciences is being touted for a Remdesivir treatment for existing covid19 patients. Buyer beware - look at their US price gouging tactics for drugs like Solvaldi (Hep-C at $84,000 per patient treatment) and Truvada (HIV at $20,000 per year). 

In fact with our totally broken and fragmented healthcare payor system, we should expect jaw-dropping bills to be issued for those covid19 patients who survived and perished in ICUs across the country."

2020-05-18 15:55:43,"Numerous studies of actual Covid 19 patients still leave questions as to whether antibodies produced during an infection produce full immunity from reinfection and if so for how long.  This company’s work with eight test subjects is promising but far too small and early to be dispositive.  

We’re also still learning about this virus.  It’s now apparent it has many devastating presentations, not just affecting lungs, and reaching children previously thought to be largely immune.

New reports abound of people who seem to be recovering well and then suddenly die.  Long term effects of the virus are still unknown.

No doubt Trump and friends’ tsunami of Covid 19 related lies, happy talk and incitements to defy health protocols makes me suspicious of any corporate PR hinting the worst is past.  

But reality also makes me pause.  My family, friends and I will still be social distancing, wearing masks and using lots of soap and sanitizer in the months ahead."
2020-05-18 16:03:09,"This is certainly promising. But it is early days. 

Be prepared for bumps in the road.   It will be stupendously lucky if this approach doesn’t encounter some major pitfalls. 

The company would be wiser to avoid raising expectations and just do the work.  The logic of the method is trivial. But the genetic biology, cell biology and immunology is very tricky in humans. 

Note that the idea behind sequencing the genome was trivially obvious. Gene based precision medicine and diagnostics of genetic disease was simply a no brainer once you had the genome sequence. 

20 years later and now more than a trillion dollars annual investment — and virtually no advance in precision diagnostics or therapy. 

Just do the work. Get lucky. And surprise us."

I was fine at 12 weeks, in fact I thought the new biologic was a miracle curing my migraines, then my body started shutting down after 6 months.  It was absolutely terrifying and took months for doctors and myself to figure out since these biologic drugs are new and none of these long term debilitating side effects were disclosed.  12,000 victims have reported serious adverse effects to the FDA and the warning label has not changed.

No amount of money in the world can adequately compensate them for ending the global shelter in place and saving millions of lives.  Unbelievable the envy is already showing.  

Here's the deal: the day you find a solution that gets the entire US population and much of the globe safely out of the home and living life again is the day you get to be super rich and important.  Until then, be happy with what you have and focus on improving your own lot rather than focusing on the lot of people who are rightly compensated for their vast achievements.

Suppose the vaccine passes trials; since Trump is politically involved, would you wonder if the clinical trials were rigged?

He said that he’d “recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine, and these data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020.”  Before taking on the job, Dr. Slaoui held discussions with Jared Kushner.

Does Dr. Slaoui have a financial interest in Moderna? Does he own shares? Have Jared Kushner or members of Trump’s family purchased Moderna shares recently? What guarantees are there that the process of selecting and evaluating vaccine candidates will be open, rigorous and accountable?

Why is there no data on antibody levels for the rest of the folks? Also at this time it is great that these people did not have adverse effects. But it is a tiny study. Animals don’t count. Besides let’s wait till these people are exposed to not just the strain which the mRNA is engineered from, how about exposing them to the varied strains. That too at different doses of virus. Sure hope they can fight the corona virus directly. Also let us know in a couple of months what their antibody levels are. Hopefully maintained but who knows. 

The other thing is that nasty Kawasaki like disease in children. The suspect was thought to be a human corona virus in 2005. Does having covid make you vulnerable to seemingly harmless other strains? In other words will this vaccine cause other nasty ripple effects especially in children? 

I am leery of this present administration and their early trumpeting of success. How much time, money and energy hydroxychloroquine wasted all over the world. 

I suggest instead of waiting for pharmaceutical magic to happen, this is the time to shore up your own health.

The 8 are NOT the only people who had a positive result, they are just the first where they have data to report out. Stay tuned. Further  Phase 2 and 3 trials will be bigger and done if Phase I goes well and are intended to address concerns about the numbers of people who tried it and how different people react. As has been said over and over by many, many public health professionals vaccine development is hard and often meets with failure so positive results are good. 

A bigger concern is the administration's impulse to be political when making public health decisions.  It will be years before we hear of all the sketchy contracts that were handed out or who directed what equipment where. Who knows how they decided where to send all the Remdesivir doses they had to give out.   After years of trump bashing our allies and now China and WHO, they have to be terrified that China or some other source will come up with the first effective vaccine and decide to put the US at the back of the line.

Indeed, currently available antibody testing, and studies based on this testing, have indicated as much. The NYT has given significant press to attacking those studies. The same NYT that is now trumpeting the development of a vaccine that will - gasp - produce antibodies. Instead of hanging our hat on dubious vaccine development data, why not expand antibody testing for the general population? Those cowering inside might be shocked at what the testing reveals"
2020-05-18 19:01:12,"The CEO was quoted elsewhere as saying that the vaccine could be ready sometime this fall ""for emergency use."" Most people are missing this important qualifier. What it means is that, with any luck, the vaccine will be shown to be safe in the near term, based on small numbers in clinical trials, and that recipients do go on to produce antibodies. On this timeframe, it will not have been proven efficacious for actual protection against infection and disease. ""Emergency use"" implies that it will be ready for conducting a massive real-time experiment on the population, where we would finally find out, over months, whether it is safe on a large scale, over time, and whether it is at all effective. Trump will be able to declare an ""emergency"" that would justify this kind of experiment, but would frame it as, ""I told you I could make a vaccine happen, when everybody said it couldn't be done."" As for the Phase 1 results from 8 people, well OK, it's good news as far as it goes, but completely to be expected if the scientists know what they're doing."

There're lots of conspiracy theories however folks should look at science and facts but there is wide  spread skepticism at all levels around the globe. Rick Bright's testimony to Senate was quite an eye opner; it exposed the gross misconduct and criminal negligence at the highest level. If counter measures were taken like Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South korea, and Newzeland so many deaths could've been averted in America and western europe. 

And if folks in America and rest of the world get more apprehensive and question the safety and efficacy, cost effectiveness of each intervention, and reliability of Trump administration; it could become a slippery slope. After so much despair and gloom; folks are cautiously optimistic!"
2020-05-18 19:12:38,"Yeah, I’m not knowledgeable in these areas, and I am probably wrong here, too, but I have seen in my Internet travels references to a history of failure of coronavirus trial vaccines, specifically concerning the paradoxical immune response, wherein binding-type antibodies (created by immune system response to a vaccine) enhance the infectious syndrome when exposed to natural infection by the wild virus, in animal test subjects. Now, if I read this article, here, correctly, these trial results evince creation of the desired neutralizing-type antibodies, but I’m unsure the discussion is complete enough without both greater distinction between the two types, and with reference to the too-briefly mentioned adverse syndrome, which I believe is a more common cause of trial vaccine failure than this article notes (as “uncommon”), and notably so in the history of coronavirus trial vaccine failures."

Some time in the future we will be able to make a vaccine for any viral illness in under three  to six months.    The more money the government pours into the manufacture of vaccines the greater the improvement in technology.
As things stand right now, we have no other choice.  We must produce a safe and effective vaccine quickly or face total ruin of our American way of life as we owe it today.

The Oxford group in England has found an effective vaccine in monkeys (more close to humans).  They are starting Phase 3.  Moderna is only started phase two.

A study/trial with eight healthy people means NOTHING.

Anybody else thinking ""I Am Legend""?  

Actually, a fourth:
Given the likely outcome of never-approved vaccine technology being fast-tracked in trials that couldn't make it past any credible university's IRB, imagine how this will exacerbate the public health nightmare that is the anti-vaxx movement.

How about this afternoon?"
2020-05-18 19:19:11,"Some perspective: worldwide clinical trials are underway for 15 different vaccine candidates, 8 in phase II, ahead of Moderna. 

For example, the Oxford group  (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html</a>) is running a phase I+II trial on 1000+ participants. Its ChAdOx1 vaccine candidate is rooted in well-established technology. Experiments have shown it is effective not only in mice, but also in rhesus macaques, eliciting robust antibody and cellular immune response, and protecting the animals from developing pneumonia upon viral exposure (in contrast to control animals). Most importantly perhaps, none of the vaccinated animals exhibited signs of immune-enhancement of disease, one of the major concerns in vaccine development. Their experiments and results were described in detail in a preprint posted publicly online and submitted to a scientific journal for validation by peer review. 

Moderna has pinned its future on delivering on their highly optimistic promise of a novel type of vaccine ready for deployment by the end of the year, further fueling expectations now by announcing their candidate appears to ""work so well"" because 8 volunteers developed antibodies, 5 without getting sick. This announcement was submitted to news media for validation by stock market review.  

I wish them the best, but let's keep in mind what this virus has hopefully taught us all by now: optimism is no substitute for science."

This is what the end of the American Experiment looks like.

1. We read a ""news"" press release about a science-denying company that claims that 8 people in a ""study"" means we have a vaccine -- in order to engineer a Wall Street stock bounce to benefit a former executive who now works for the White House.

2. We listen to ""miracle cure"" claims about choloquine, while a handful of the president's top advisors get rich by speculating on hoarding this drug.

3. And our president told us to inject bleach into our bodies.

God help us all."

While the Washington Post also buries the lead that the high dose group suffered symptoms of the disease this article really downplays it as if this were a vaccine reaction and not what is likely is really happening that the vaccine is giving people the disease as can happen with a modified live vaccine 

This actually means that testing a modified live should proceed with extra caution but instead we are removing the brakes"
2020-05-18 20:09:52,"I'd rather being hearing reports of a well-coordinated national effort, led and monitored by the CDC and FDA, rather than press releases from individual biotech companies with clear financial interests in proclaiming ""progress"" on a vaccine.

As an average, middle-class American, actual progress on improved testing and vaccine development, involving large, well-organized trials is much more meaningful than a momentary bump in the stock market.  I'm sure if I had a few million dollars to play around with in day-trading, I'd feel much differently."

While others may assume their are seeing the light of a train ahead, I tend to hold onto some hope and faith that the glimmer I see is that of the sun.

2020-05-18 20:17:06,"There have been reports of many promising HIV vaccines since the virus was isolated in 1985, and only slightly fewer predictions of almost-there candidates. SARS-CoV-2 is a completely different type of virus with none of the particular capacities of HIV to elude the silver bullet. But, as has been clear over the past three months, rumors of success in terms of testing technologies, treatments, and vaccines will far exceed actual achievements. Be happy that despite the absolutely toxic political environment -- which makes the political silence surrounding AIDS sound like the benign gurgling of child's play -- there are thousands of researchers worldwide working with sophisticated tools to pursue technological solutions to Covid-19. But sit tight, because it's longer and bumpier ride than politicians anticipate, and there will be many challenges in terms of trials and production of even a promising vaccine. 
I'm not trying to dampen spirits, just reflect back my experience of 30 years of working with HIV and watching the public thirst for hope continually disappointed by the realities of the process of science."
2020-05-18 20:28:55,"Not positive but maybe the study was limited to 8 because this vaccine has been tested on 0 humans. Why waste time, expense, and risk with a larger group, just make sure they don’t die from it and it produces antibodies. Next phase will be larger."

2020-05-18 21:05:10,"The only thing that can stop this pandemic is an effective vaccine.  The lockdowns can't do it.

Development of a vaccine will require an all hands on deck effort by academia, government agencies such as the CDC, the NIH, and the FDA, and pharmaceutical companies.

Only ""big pharma"" has the resources to develop, test, and manufacturer a vaccine in the quantities the nation and world will require. There are many New York Times writers and readers that don't hold pharmaceutical companies in high regard.  I disagree, but it doesn't matter what opinion one holds: we need a strong pharmaceutical industry at present if we are going to overcome this virus.

Today, drug companies face an existential threat to their continued existence: American trial lawyers. In the months prior to the pandemic, lawyers have come close to bankrupting at least two large companies, Bayer and Johnson and Johnson. They have filed literally tens of thousands of multi-billion dollar lawsuits alleging that drugs cause cancer.  The suits seem largely based on junk science and sympathetic plaintiffs. The companies win many of the suits, but with so many suits filed they lose some, and it doesn't take many billion dollar verdicts to drive a firm out of business.

During the 1970's and 1980's lawyers nearly shut down the US vaccine industry; only an 11th hour no-fault liability law by Congress allowed vaccines to remain available.

Congress should pass tort reform. We need vaccines more than we need lawsuits."
2020-05-18 21:05:16,"There are at least 80 horses in this vaccine race and the only winning requirement is to eventually cross the finish line for multiple winners.

No one has closed the barn door yet, so this one is just SARS-COV-2 of a stable of potential pandemics. When will the next zoonotic microbe break loose? Eventually we’ll be prepared."
2020-05-18 21:09:41,"As a number of astute readers have pointed out, this news is extremely preliminary.  If it were this easy, we'd have had a vaccine already, not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a number of other pathogens.  By definition, vaccine studies take time that you cannot compress, beyond gearing up manufacturing in advance for different candidate vaccines, at great risk.  The clinical data from field exposure showing whether the vaccine is protective, and for how long, cannot be compressed into a matter of weeks or months.

What is particularly concerning, however, beyond the scientific questions and challenges, are the multiple areas for conflict of interest.  Case in point:  Moncef Slaoui, the former head of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline, happens to own over $10 million in stock options at Moderna.  This news has obviously affected his investment, and the timing is curious.  But that doesn't seem to be a concern of the Trump administration.  Heck, Trump himself is probably now an investor as well.  So it's going to be in someone's interest to push this candidate through (or other candidates, as the case may be), whether it is medically and scientifically warranted, or not.  If anything is being touted by the Trump administration, it simply cannot be trusted on its own."

Thanks to Trump he has divided a country even during a pandemic.
 Too bad he was not a foot spurs expert to get into our armed forces during the Vietnam war as 55 thousand of our troops who died there w/o "" Trumpian foot spurs"" did not have that NYC Drs. letter for draft exemption."
2020-05-18 20:19:36,They were close to a universal cancer vaccine...3 years ago. Received 1 Bn in venture money on the ‘promise’ and never developed a vaccine.
2020-05-18 20:22:54,Hold it folks. A trial test of 8 people is not statistically nor scientifically significant. The company may test 8 more with the opposite result.  When they test 1000 people then we should pay attention.   Especially when some people with the coronavirus don't get sick.
2020-05-18 22:31:58,Don't get your hopes up. There are thousands of drugs that appeared to be beneficial in small tests but proved to be useless in large tests.

2020-05-18 22:39:28,Oxford has been using human volunteers for nearly 8 weeks now. Why does NYT report that this is the FIRST coronavirus vaccine to be tested in people? Do they mean the first American people or first American company???
2020-05-18 22:46:50,These biotechnology companies are ecstatic that they can experiment on humans. The clinical data gathered will be very useful regardless of whether or not the vaccine is effective.

Himself he is our doctor with an undergraduate degree in economics?  Maybe he might have even better results with his other prescriptions bleach or lysol. More qualified specialists warn of the real danger of trying these dangerous cures but they are not our so called President. It might be good for our country if he tried these cures. I for one would rather be guided by these none presidential specialists than follow the quack example of ”Dr” Trump?"
2020-05-18 23:22:32,"It seems promising, but I know some people that are scouring for the slightest glint of hope will dash and leap hurdles to get a good dosage of this news, not realizing that too much reliance on it can be toxic. We all want the vaccine. An injection not only relieves one of COVID-19, but relieves many of their suffering, as millions of people are lifted out of their stressful situations and can touch, feel, love again. However, we must take out our monocles and look upon this situation with a skeptical eye.  As said in the article, such a small group of people can't be extrapolated to the entire population. Health and safety should come before boisterous remarks to drive the stocks up. When this vaccine does come out, I hope that all countries can get their fair share of the vaccine. It would be sad to see Western and advanced countries hoarding the supply for this vaccine, and leaving other countries scrambling and in a daze."

Tells you everything you need to know about the capitalism. It's not good enough that there be one successful vaccine that is produced by multiple manufacturers worldwide. No, no, no Virginia, this is first and foremost about profit. In fact, as the capitalist will tell you, nobody (except the economy destroying socialists) would even bother making a vaccine if there wasn't any money in it."
2020-05-18 23:38:46,"Well , when this vaccine is available, I wonder who will have early access to this life saving medication.
If only the wealthiest, and well connected can obtain this medication, early on, the virus will replicate, and expand through the US population. More deaths, except for the few.

I , and my family may have to cross into Canada, to obtain this vaccine, just like we had to years ago, when no flu vaccine was available here in the US."
2020-05-18 23:41:24,"So much negativity and alarmism.  Is it a blue Monday?   I consider Moderna's announcement good news.  They produced neutralizing antibodies with their vaccine.  That is significant.  Small trial, yes.  But it's a start.  We need the good news.  I am not perturbed if someone recently appointed by Trump was previously serving on Moderna's board.  I look forward to the large trials that are coming from Moderna and other companies.  I certainly am not perturbed if these companies represent Big Pharma, reviled by progressives.  I won't worry if Trump takes chloroquine.  Despite Trump taking chloroquine, the sun will come up tomorrow."
2020-05-18 23:42:05,"There are a lot of adults in the 20s,30s,40s who are relatively healthy and run a few miles a week, and don't smoke. Many of these people do not get flu shots. Even if a corona shot works, you have to convince healthy individuals that the risk of the shot is somehow less than the health risk for the virus. At the individual's own health level, there is not be strong incentive to get a corona shot, even if its available. Even harder it will be to convince people in their 50s and 60s considering the panic that has been amplified in media."
2020-05-18 23:43:53,"I spent many years in vaccine research, performing antibody assays in Phase I (small scale human safety) through Phase III (large scale efficacy) trials. Small scale generally meant at least a hundred subjects; large scale, thousands, with efficacy studies conducted over years. It  takes only a few adverse reactions to scuttle a vaccine candidate during any phase.

The very idea of announcing results of a Phase I trial after such a short time - with a sample size in the single digits - boggles my mind."
2020-05-18 23:53:28,"Cautious optimism is always good but it does sometimes feel as though the media is ready to latch onto any bad news related to it and the virus, in general. Quotes of ""That doesn’t prove it works...Small trial..."" is interesting considering these are self-evident truths (of course most people would know we aren't even close to the finish line and even then might never truly be out of the woods). Maybe it is just a reflection of the times and media's distrust of Trump even if also saying ""listen to the experts"" who are some of the people thinking we could figure this thing out given how collaborative the  science community has been in spirt of nationalism. And we wonder why folks are ready to just throw caution to the wind when divergent messages are being stoked by both sides..."
2020-05-19 00:19:52,"After a successful vaccine is developed let us globally focus on ""warp speed"" family planning initiatives. Because there are just too many humans on this planet and this is just the beginning of the pandemics we are about to face as a result of unsustainable numbers of humans. The packed humanity of a Chinese beach (or Manhattan) is not what I want for myself or my children. Fresh air, clean water, wide open spaces. Think: LESS PEOPLE."
2020-05-19 00:57:06,"This is excellent news. It does make sense to expect a relatively effective vaccine by January. We're in a new era of genetic technology--consider cancer immunotherapy using CRISPR to design bespoke CAR-T cells. This and related technologies are being applied at a high level in dozens of countries around the world. Trump will try to take credit, but that's just his MO.

I do wonder, though, about the opening line: We're told this is the first to be tested on humans, but then, a few lines down, learn that ""human trials have already started for several manufacturers"" globally. I hope this isn't another case of American insularity, in which it hasn't really happened unless it happened in the USA."
2020-05-19 01:30:43,"I commented on this before but most commenters are still under the impression that it was a trial of 8 people.  It was not.  It was a trial of 45 people.  ALL made antibodies in numbers comparable to people infected with covid-19,  Then 8 of these were tested to see if the anti-bodies would actually neutralize  covid-19 in a petri dish, and all did.  They only did this test on 8 of the 45 because it is costly and time consuming and there is no reason to believe that if the antibodies of 8 people who seroconverted could neutralize covid-19, it would not be the same for the other 37 participants. 100% of 45 participants all seroconverting is extremely statistically significant."
2020-05-19 01:34:01,"An 8 patient study is small that it has virtually no reliability.

This thing is a long way off."
2020-05-19 02:05:04,"What’s “interesting” about this report is how small the study’s participants pool is to claim success.   The only beneficiaries for the time being are the company’s stock manipulators.  

What comes to mind is Trump’s push for  Chloroquine, which though it maybe good for 47 users, it’s poison for the majority of the population when misused for illnesses other than what’s intended for.    There may be exceptions that only  full fledged studies can confirm .    Results for well crafted scientific studies are needed before making landmark announcements."
2020-05-18 23:15:08,"""The actual data from these preliminary tests has not been published or shared publicly,... WHAT?? are you kidding? From everything I've read, this is happy-face fodder for the Trump campaign and the current attack on WHO. I only wish it were not. So we don't know, do we, that the subjects were confined such that it's guaranteed that their antibodies a) were not a result of a previous exposure; b) were not the result of a random exposure after inoculation, c) result of certain genetic markers the subjects themselves had -- it's a total of EIGHT PEOPLE.  I've read that Trump Family is connected to this firm. Is this true, and, if so, why is this not in headlines?"
2020-05-18 23:18:40,"It would be great if Moderna has a truly efficacious, safe solution for all variants of COVID.  Even better if they can ramp up 200 million doses by year-end.   Better yet if this isn't just another spin and or worse corrupt spin.

Despite whatever truth may be behind this announcement, for Trump to say he is taking hydroxychloroquine to the American public even when there are no good tests borders on criminal negligence.   Leadership is about setting a great example.  But given a staff built with people who made their fortunes causing other people harm, people like Mnuchin who was involved with exploiting the forclosures which caused hundreds of thousands to lose their homes, I doubt it.

Perhaps if we stop testing for COVID-19, the actual efficacy of the Moderna Vaccine, then we'll have few cases and we can claim that Moderna is a proven efficacious vaccine against all mutations and versions of COVID?    That would fit with Trump's reasoning.  

I do hope the Moderna vaccine or some modification thereof does turn out to be an effective and safe vaccine against all forms of COVID-19.  I am highly skeptical but even if it does turn out to be the end-all , be-all solution to this dilemma, getting 200 million doses ramped up by year-end is not what I consider realistic.   The announcements today were great for the stock market.  Let's see how long another bit of incomplete data can hold things up.  Maybe we'll be back in the post Virus level bull market in a couple of weeks?"
2020-05-18 23:54:56,"Americans fund this research with their tax money.

I'd propose putting it in the public domaine as America's gift to the world...isn't that a strange thought:  America saves the world.

Of course, Moderna can have a share of the ""profits"" equal to their investment...which I'm guessing would probably make them the minority 1% owner at best.

Let's hope it and similar vaccines work...and even the vaccine ""doubters"" take it...so we can all be well!"
2020-05-19 00:45:40,"I think this story lacks proper balance and perspective, and should have included more comment by infectious disease experts. I had to read posts to this story by several experts to put the news into perspective. While hopeful about the results, these experts caution the sample size of 8 people is far too small to warrant such hype. The story also should have noted that a Moderna director has stepped down to head Trump's initiative to speed up vaccine development. What a coincidence. News about the results based on just 8 people caused Moderna stock and the overall market to shoot up to the delight of Trump and the ex-director."
2020-05-19 00:47:00,"Since the senior and junior Trumps seem to believe this pandemic is a hoax foisted on them, they should never be allowed to get the vaccine--by their own admission they don't need it. Tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths they caused demand that they don't get it."

He is a former pharmacutical salesman.  He has been selling his stock in this company steadily as the stock price has skyrocketed.  While he is claiming intitial success, none of the clinical findings have been made public or have been peered review.

Of course people are going to be taking a untested clinical trial drug because Trump just wants to have a win.
Anyone who believes that this company is a winner just wait till tomorrow there will be another company who is receiving boat loads of research money from the government with no oversight.  Chaos is in charge of everything that is happening now.  Dr. Bright told us last week what is going on and he had no reason to lie . Trump, chaos, vaccine.

2020-05-19 02:39:49,Many people who invest in the stock market have no idea what they are doing. CoVid19 is a novel virus which means it is a new form not previously seen. Its full characteristics are not known. How it is transmitted is not fully known. What harm it will cause is not fully known. There are many unknowns because it is a new form of corona virus. Any vaccine developed at this time is too early to be fully effective. We still have regular flu and getting the flu shot to be effective each year is a challenge. The normal process of developing a vaccine is being rushed to lessen its impact but given the unknowns it is not likely to be discovered or formulated so early. Anyone who is investing at this time and hoping for a speedy vaccine is engaging in wishful thinking.
2020-05-19 03:01:46,This is a phase 1! Efficacy wasn't looked at. How is this promising? This is bad sensationalism. Glad wall street is happy.
2020-05-19 02:57:01,"I wonder how many people remember how early on in his term, Trump wanted to have huge cutbacks in funding for the National Institutes of Health. Congress overrode him on that, and we can see how great it was that Congress did that, given how much support the NIH is providing for developing vaccines and for R&D and testing of potential treatments like remdesivir. NIH funding really does seem to help pharm and biotech companies make good new drugs, etc.: see <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818650"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818650</a>/ 

If anyone working on the Biden campaign is reading this, please remind voters how Trump tried to not just gut funding for the CDC, but also make a huge cut in funding for the NIH! ;) 

Also, I trust a Biden administration to fix any real problems the CDC may have. My understanding is that the Obama administration fixed a lot of problems FEMA had with disaster relief. They saw how bad the federal response to Katrina was, and so knew they had to make improving FEMA a priority. Then their improvements seemed to have worked when Hurricane Sandy hit; also, the FEMA response to Hurricane Harvey in 2017 on the Gulf Coast was good because Obama left FEMA in good shape for Trump, even if Trump seemingly didn't care much about Maria hitting Puerto Rico. Obama had less reason to worry about the CDC than FEMA, but as CNN reported recently, in 2014 after an Ebola outbreak Obama did ask Congress for more funds for pandemic preparation... but the Republicans in charge said no...."
2020-05-19 03:26:33,"This isn't the first and won't be the last of the pharma/bioscience companies that are all to eager to announce a breakthrough against covid with minimal scientific backing or cherrypicked information. There are a lot of very sketchy things going on with some companies and the SEC is likely asleep at the wheel.

Moderna's announcement today was perfectly timed. A ""promising results"" announcement on 8 of 45 volunteers is weak. A massive increase in stock valuation promptly followed by a 1.25 billion equity offering is convenient timing. Why does this matter? A higher share price is significantly less dilution.

Other past examples: Sorrento Therapeutics last week announcing they have a ""100%"" cure for covid that works followed by a price jump from $2~ to $10~ finally resting at $6 as of today. 

Gilead: Needs to be investigated by the SEC. April 16th, literally minutes before market close and an hour before their first announcement of a ""breakthrough with Remdisvir"" someone very aggressively purchased unbelievably optimistic call options which is a sign of someone lighting money on fire or having insider knowledge. 

I don't know who is going to come out with the cure or vaccine, but anyone paying attention knows these pharma companies need to be taken with a grain of salt with their hope filled announcements."
2020-05-19 03:49:25,"Any progress on vaccine development (and drug therapy) is good news. But looking ahead to later phases, I am very concerned about the potential ""challenge"" trials, where volunteers are given the vaccine (or not, if they are in the placebo arm) and then deliberately exposed to live virus. Thousands of people are said to have already signed up. Two problems with this: the volunteers are probably all young and healthy, and so will not be representative of the more at-risk groups (older, immune-compromised, underlying illness) who need a vaccine most. The vaccine might work very differently on the immune systems of the volunteer group vs the immune systems of the population at large. Secondly, there is a real ethical question in risking the lives of people in human trials. Are they screening out people who are depressed, suicidal, or have a hero complex? Just because someone volunteers to quite possibly die, does that make it ethical to experiment on them? One could argue this is the principle underlying military service, but put it another way: if the government conducted human sacrifice, would that be ok as long as some people volunteered for it?"
2020-05-19 03:52:47,What is wrong with the market? Yes this is a bit of hope for a vaccine but the vaccine is still over a year away before it could ever be put out to the populace in a safe manner. How can the market buyers get excited about this little bit of news. We are still in for devastating results on the economy. The Stock market makes no sense other than buyers trying to profit off anything that could possibly in the most remote possibility of making a profit off this situation .
2020-05-19 04:38:39,"Eventually, there will be several vaccines to choose from, then the question will be their relative efficacy, expense, and longevity.

2020-05-19 03:35:37,"The results so far are the easy part.  Now, what happens when these people get infected with the actual virus—does it make them sicker than they otherwise would have gotten or kill them? That’s a major reason a vaccine for the original SARS coronavirus was never successfully developed. It’s called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).  The news media are clueless about the science."

They have off shore accounts and don’t have to pay any taxes for a life time.
2020-05-19 05:02:06,"This is very promising. Development of this vaccine was NOT funded by US taxpayers. Moderna got $480 million from US government literally four weeks ago to ""accelerate development"" of the vaccine. 

First, let's hope this works. And if it does, Moderna deserves a reasonable profit, even if that's $20 or $30 per vaccine. Even then, the total cost of the drug to inoculate the entire US population would be less than $10 billion, which is peanuts compared to havoc wreaked by the virus."

Even Fauci’s 12 to 18 months (which inexplicably has remained “12 to 18” since January as if time has stood still) has been called “ambitious”. Now what am I missing?

2020-05-19 07:13:36,"Generating an antibody response is a basic requirement of any vaccine.  The questions for SARS-CoV-2 is 1) whether or not the antibodies generated in response to the vaccine are inhibiting or enhancing viral activity and 2) how long does the vaccine provide protection?

This is particularly relevant for a coronavirus which are known to mutate.  There are currently at least 14 SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations identified.  In addition, many of the coronaviruses, including SARS, are known to have the ability to undergo Antibody Dependent Enhancement.  If this is true for SARS-CoV-2 then vaccine development efforts will be significantly hampered.

We seem to be hoping for a magic bullet without recognising that magic bullets are remarkably difficult, if not impossible, to make."
2020-05-19 08:52:47,"I get the reason for the manic (stock) reaction to this company, but it seems clear to me that the investor community doesn't have a clue.  Why?  The market is acting like the vaccine will be in production next week.  Wrong.

This was a Phase 1 trial, using an extremely small sample set.  For those who don't understand the process you need to understand that there are three Phases a new, experimental, drug goes thru.  Each Phase takes approximately ONE year.

And then, if by the end of Phase 3 the drug still proves efficacious, it then takes the Fed up to a year to sanction it as a legitimate product.  So do the math on how long this will take.

I'm not saying that as this goes along it would be subject to this usual process.  I'd bet on it being expedited should its effectiveness continue to prove out.  I'm only saying that once again, as usual, some on Wall Street are putting the cart before the horse.  

And also as usual others, on Wall Street, are taking self-interested advantage of those who should know better.

If they are successful in quality and quantity at the Chinese price, the stock for these money-grabbing pharms will collapse especially for Modera- a company with a limited number of products.  Sell the stock while you are ahead."
2020-05-19 09:18:36,As a 68 year old heart attack survivor any news of an effective Covod-19 vaccine excites me. As a thinking person I also know that a sample size of 8 people is only Step 1 which lessens the excitement.
2020-05-19 10:05:12,"These mini-steps should be reported, but not as anything consequential.

I fear that people might start believing a vaccine is coming sooner not  later, then become more reckless in behavior."
2020-05-19 10:06:05,"Especially encouraging - well beyond the prospect for this virus - is that this new mRNA technology - if successful - could be used for other virus types, extant (Zika, Ebola, etc) and future. Very hopeful. (The downside - if it works - is, that like most technologies it could also be harnessed for biological warfare)."
2020-05-19 10:50:27,"There are two things in this article that I find suspicious. First, the article claims this is the first Coronavirus vaccine tested in humans. Yet, the news have reported similar tests taking place in other parts of the world, Spain for example, weeks ago. Did the article mean to say this is the first one in the United States? Second, the article states that “Work on the new coronavirus started in January, as soon as Chinese scientists posted its genetic sequence on the internet.” Hasn’t the government been accusing China of hiding information about the virus at the beginning of the outbreak? And yet this company started developing a vaccine in January, thanks to information shared by China. I’m as eager as anyone to go back to my normal life. And I hope a vaccine is available by the end of the year. Yet, it worries me that the race to be the first to find THE vaccine will affect the quality and/or safety of the product. For all those reasons, I find this piece of news problematic."
2020-05-19 11:10:08,"I agree with many of the previous comments , the trial is reason for cautious optimism. At the same time I remain extremely skeptical of any information delivered or endorsed by this administration."
2020-05-19 11:29:13,To be cautious does not mean one is negative.  There are good reasons why certain protocols are in place to increase the odds that the new drug is not only effective but safe.  These guidelines have to be followed.
2020-05-19 10:55:48,Bravo President Trump for his leadership! Trump reached out and coordinated public-private and university science leaders to rapidly mobilize research efforts and logistics when the vaccine is ready.
2020-05-19 06:34:40,Desperate times call for immediate action. How are you going to tell someone deemed an overwhelming multiple risk sufferer who is very much likely to die if infected that they can't have the vaccine now because it could harm them?
2020-05-19 12:24:42,"Regardless your political persuasion, this is great news. I for one am happy to see the collaboration between our Government and the Private sector to move quickly to develop a vaccine for COVID."
2020-05-19 06:15:39,"Unbelievable, an company headquartered in an East Coast blue state is winning the race for a vaccine.  All those taxes and regulations really holding them back."
2020-05-19 10:36:24,"IMO cautious optimism should greet this news. As a researcher colleague reminded me recently, when it comes to early scientific results, too often “ mice and rats lie and monkeys exaggerate.” We also have a POTUS who has linked vaccines to autism and now claims he is taking a drug that has not been recommended by any credible science to prevent or cure Covid-19.  What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-05-19 08:20:51,The world is begging for a vaccine and the first company that gets one is going to be up there with Jonas Salk in the history books.I think it is kind of self serving to make this kind of announcement on the part of the company.It really helped the stock market but did it really help anyone?Why not wait until you have something ready to go?
2020-05-19 06:01:07,"I am very glad to hear this. But the vaccine will have to compete with Hydrochloroquine. Why? Because Trump somehow has financial interests in that ineffective Malaria drug. Otherwise he wouldn't risk his own life by taking it. 

There's a HUGE amount of money at play here, one can tell by simply looking at his statements (""What do you have to lose"" sounded much like a guy in a dirty overcoat at a street corner).

One can only hope that the guys at Moderna are clever and corrupt (yes, corrupt!) enough to also bribe the President of the United States and his family so their actual cure can be rolled out and not stopped by ""technicalities"" and ""the bureaucracy"" (by order of the guy at the top).

Thinking back to the good old days of Ford, Carter, Clinton and Obama a comment like what I wrote above seems impossible. But this is the reality in America in the year 2020. Or as Trump would say: ""it is what it is""...

PS: Do not forget BioNTech in Mainz/Germany who teamed up with Pfizer. They also have a vaccine in the making and had a head start. Regrettably Germany isn't quite as willing to sacrifice innocent lives, therefor the testing and certification is a bit slower, but we'll get there, hopefully, and then Pfizer can do the rollout of the century!"

2020-05-19 12:51:52,"A good first step, but not a magic bullet. That said, great advertising for Moderna, which is just one of many companies pushing to get a vaccine ready. And interesting to see how many Trump supporters look at any hesitation on the part of observers to get excited about the Moderna trails and conclude it's all about Trump, all about politics. Why is it so hard for these people to believe -- let alone accept -- that there are others who simply want what's best for the country and for their fellow citizens? Sad."
2020-05-19 13:59:11,"Great. Now, how can Republicans make as much money as possible from this while benefiting the least number of people?"
2020-05-19 14:18:28,"I'm being optimistic. Let's say these preliminary results about safety and immunogenicity are borne out in larger-scale trials over the next 2 or 3 months. Then you're facing the real test, for efficacy, to prove that it protects people from infection and disease in the real world. How is that trial to be conducted? For all trial subjects, whether they get the vaccine or a placebo, they'll have to be instructed to maintain all recommended efforts at social distancing, isolation, hand-washing, etc. It will be hard (not impossible) and it will take a long time for that trial to reveal that the vaccine offered any protection. Remember the careful wording of the Moderna CEO saying that the vaccine could be ready this year for widespread use ""on an emergency basis."" That must mean ""without the benefit of a rigorous efficacy trial."" In other words, if you want a vaccine this year, it would have to be offered as an ""experimental"" treatment. I'm not saying that's unwarranted under dire circumstances, but people should not have the false hope of a proven vaccine this year. BTW, I am very hopeful for eventual success of any of the numerous vaccines just getting into testing."
2020-05-18 23:22:08,"Early Moderna results in the least vulnerable adult age group of below 55 are deceptive and give false hope. Over 92% of the deaths due to COVID-19 are in persons above 55. Agree that safety trials for phase I FDA clinical study are done in healthy adults but proving the COVID-19 vaccine candidate is safe in 8 healthy adults, below 55, not in the group that is very likely to die if confirmed positive does not inspire confidence. 

A deployable effective vaccine against COVID-19 before cows come home is a MUST if we are to get a grip of this global panic pandemic. 93% of the people who have died in the USA during the past 10 wks have been due to causes other than COVID-19. But what has happened is we have STOPPED paying optimal attention to other diseases due to the lock down and clinic shut downs treating other diseases and life threatening conditions. My beloved father who was born during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and surviving through 7 pandemics including the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, passed away a few hours ago following myocardial infarction. No fever, no symptoms attributable to COVID-19 infection and no exposure to any confirmed positive case. The lock down hindered his getting emergency care for the serious treatable condition he was in. There were no beds available in the hospital in which he had successfully recovered.

My father repeatedly said prevention is better than cure and received appropriate vaccines. Hardly any promise in preliminary results."
2020-05-18 23:41:26,"A trial of eight people is miniscule.  The fact that the stock market was enthused by such limited news is laughable. The fact that Trump's new vaccine czar, former CEO of the company, has not relinquished his stock, is not.

Trump's mafia make Harding's Teapot Dome look like olive oil importation."
2020-05-18 23:55:22,"I want to see Trump have a hissy fit when Dr. Fauci gets the Nobel Prize (or as Trump spells it Noble Prize) for medicine.

2020-05-19 07:17:50,To proclaim Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine safe after testing it in 8 patients is absurd.
2020-05-19 11:19:36,"Doesn't it seem a bit odd that the leader of Operation Warp Speed has (had) large number of shares in Moderna and they get headlines of a ""breakthrough"", their stock makes a large jump, and this person cashes out?"
2020-05-19 13:55:36,"This is the trumpster playing with the media again.  Eight handpicked volunteers is not exactly a representative sample as noted by others, but since most don't really get statistical analysis, they won't read past the headline."
2020-05-19 14:04:03,Promising early results is deceptive and all hype and no cattle. It certainly made a lot of stock holders rich but hardly news worthy at this time. In fact it id ridiculous that the results are selectively shared without proper controls. One cannot evaluate the value of these very very early results.
2020-05-19 14:08:02,"I am interested in this mRNA vaccine's mode of action. If this vaccine induces healthy cells to express viral spike proteins on their surface, thus stimulating an immune response, what is the risk of creating an auto-immune disorder?"
2020-05-19 15:02:43,what about the risk of mutation seasonal flu does have to have new shot every year
2020-05-19 13:26:56,"As someone who spent a career in this world, I’m sorry to be Benny Buzzkill here, but this is a case of magical thinking run amok.

- No vaccine against an RNA virus is licensed today.

- The fastest-ever development time for any vaccine - the “easiest” one - was 4 years.

- The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus will mutate while vaccine-developers run their clinical trials, and look for antibody production against a strain that by then may have become “obsolete” (like flu viruses do).

- This is a case of 8 healthy volunteers. Comparing a uniformly healthy group of 8 volunteers to the big population of people - with co-morbidities - that this vaccine will go into if it ever reaches Phase III (unlikely...) is like comparing an 8 year-old’s driveway moves to those of Lebron James. 

- Even if this brand-new technology ever did produce quantities of vaccine that are adequate for clinical trials, the likelihood of being able to scale-up the production process a few hundred-millionfold, to make the vaccine commercial-izable (yes - that much) is like dreaming that Uncle Bob’s basement wine-making operation could be expanded into an airplane hangar and produce the #1 Cabernet Sauvignon in the world.

Dream on, folks. It’s gonna take a few hundred shots on goal (dud vaccines) to get one or two to trickle past the goalie, into the back of the net, and it won’t happen until 2023 at the earliest.

Keep wearing those masks, keep up the social distancing, etc., and hope for a vaccine in 2023."
2020-05-19 13:53:14,"The novel thing about this vaccine Is that by inserting the messenger RNA into a normal cell, it fools that cell into making the viral coat protein on the surface of an otherwise normal cell in that person.    This induces an immune response from the body to attack that viral coat spike protein because it is recognized as “non self”.   Since this spike protein is how the virus attaches to a host and causes infection in the first place, a high level of this antibody is exactly what you want.   

This same human produced antibody is what is being harvested from recovered patients to treat very sick ones.   Very encouraging."
2020-05-19 14:30:48,wow the ex CEO who has millions of shares works for the government vaccine program .

2020-05-18 14:47:21,"I'm an infectious diseases physician who has worked in drug development for 28 years, with 13 new drugs approved, in part, through my work. These data are extremely preliminary. Drugs fail at every step of the way every day.

But there's another issue: mRNA is EXTREMELY fragile and must be stored (and shipped) in a thermally stable - and very cold - environment. How's that going to happen? Unless they can manipulate the molecule, which they are trying to do - to make it more stable, this is a logistics problem (along with the manufacture of vials, syringes, needles and recruitment of health care workers for administration of 300 million + doses) that hasn't even begun to be addressed."
2020-05-18 19:18:04,"The leader of Trump's vaccine efforts Dr. Moncef Slaoui holds a $10m investment in Moderna, and was a former board member. He still has not divested himself of this investment and likely stands to make a great deal of money, if he does, now that Moderna stock has been pumped up.

After the whistleblower revelations by Dr. Bright about Trump pushing hydroxychloroquine, despite its inefficacy and safety issues, and relationships that Trump officials have with hydroxychloroquine manufacturers, I'd be wary of any news report promising an early cure. Especially one regarding a very new and unproven technology.

Insider trading and pump-and-dump schemes have been rampant with Republicans since Trump took office, from Carl Icahn's steel trades, to now — where Kelly Loeffler, Jim Inhofe, Richard Burr, and other prominent Republicans dumped stocks in January and February, before the pandemic reached the United States.

On the whole, I would have thought the media and the public would be much more circumspect of any therapeutic with even a marginal connection with this White House, by now. 

We've seen too much death already, resulting from the incompetence and corruption that runs rampant in the Trump administration. Skepticism is warranted."

2020-05-20 11:29:37,"This cannot end well. This virus has gained a huge evolutionary advantage by being able to spread through people without symptoms. Hence it will spread. Masks and social distancing may have a slowing effect but it will be limited. And people are generally not very disciplined unless they are forced to.
Here in France I see a good third of people not applying appropriate rules despite a clear and repeated message from the authorities and still very strict rules for restaurants and public gatherings.
What the Americans are now doing is reckless and utterly naive. In a way a very American approach in the sense of Churchill's statement that Americans will always do the right thing after they have exhausted all alternatives.
It is highly implausible that the US will avoid a second wave (actually it is still in the middle of the first) and it is obvious that you cannot run a normal economy in times of a massive health crisis. There are limits to what a can do spirit can achieve."

It's guidance, not a law. secondly, perhaps link to the choir in Oregon that chose to have practice earlier on in the pandemic, causing over 40 of the 60 participants to become ill and several to die.

If the R-naught for this virus hits 1.0, then goes below that, rapidly approaching 0, to me that means the virus is getting less and less CONTAGIOUS, and finally is no longer contagious amongst the entire population. So, the question is: Isn’t isolation of those already infected, until they can no longer spread the virus because it’s lost the ability to be contagious, the best treatment we have right now? What I don’t understand is how the virus can possibly be perpetually contagious. At some point, even the infected can’t spread it, because it’s no longer contagious. Thanks!"

2020-05-20 13:41:33,"No matter the neoteric medical guidelines, the WH has its own esoteric renditions of COVID-19 treatments and recommendations. Apparently, Trump seems quite unwilling to budge an inch from HCQ, and his utter disrespect for science has the potential to peeve even the most patient medical investigator. He also seems to promote his own picayune pursuits of non-facts as viable, credible, and even superior to the well-established and proven ill-effects of HCQ and Azithromycin. 

Only a quisling will, in all likelihood, undermine the validity of  axiomatic principles, possibly, by charading as a do-gooder, and resorting to prevarications. And that can be a Gordian knot of sorts. For instance, Trump is almost acting like a pitchman for HCQ, which has a potential adverse event of engendering QT prolongation of the EKG tracings, resulting in some fatal form of arrhythmia called ''Torsades de pointes'', and that is not a fun fact, but can be fatal. 

But then why would Trump listen to that, since he is already convinced HCQ is a silver bullet for COVID-19. His unshakable faith in that drug has the experts worried. But then again, Trump is not."

Recall how controversial Measles vaccination has been, or how the easily administered Oral Polio Vaccine (which also reduces risk by herd immunity) was replaced with the injected vaccine because communities were ineffective in lowering risk for immune compromised children.  School reopening is possible, but who will check children every day for fevers, or illness? Will every school have a Nurse Practitioner available? Will the local Pediatric Society object, as physicians have in the past? Will places of work send workers home with the sniffles? How easy will it be to be tested, on demand? Are we disciplined enough to isolate communities when there is an outbreak? And who in Washington will help every State with the cost of implementation of these measures?"

2020-05-20 11:30:17,"I think about my grandfather's life -- he was born in 1900. 14 when WW1 started. Lived through the Spanish Flu Pandemic. Family ruined in the Crash of 1929. Lived through the depression, while starting a family. Enlisted in WW2. Lived through Polio. One of his sons served in Korea -- narrowly surviving an attack that left his whole platoon dead. Lived through The Cuban Missile Crisis, Viet Nam, and the Civil Rights movement. Through the Aids Crisis. As an elderly man in his 90's he was obsessed with how humanity could get rid of pollution and garbage... Here's the thing,  he would NOT have be whining right now about being locked down for a couple months in order to slow the progress of a dangerous pathogen to which no one has natural immunity. He would have worried about economic repercussions -- AND he would have been worried about the safety of others. He devoted his life to  surviving, caring and providing the best he could for others. When times were tough, and there were lots of those times in the 1900's, he worked hard to find ways to adapt and get on with life. 
But no whining -- and no selfishness.  There are aspects of American Culture that are all on parade right now under the label of ""freedom"" that disgust me."

And most of all, we’ll continue to miss human contact with others still.  We’ll miss time spent with grandchildren.  We will refrain from hugging those we love.  

Wisconsin is a mess.  We were forced to stand in lines to vote during a deadly pandemic.  Our mail in ballots got lost.  Protestors with guns have stormed our Capitol because they want to open bars.  Towns are varied in what’s allowed and what isn’t.  Restricted out of staters are swooping our little tourist towns like never before.  We’ve been sacred in many weird and new ways.  

Our governor and state public health director have tried his best to keep us safe.  But our Republican legislature and courts have fought them every step of the way.  

We feel for people who want to work, who have lost earnings, who need to support families.  But it’s gotten to the point decisions are made - are we willing to pay a price of never hugging again because we just won’t be around at all?  I cannot come to terms with that."

My family witnessed this out for a drive.
 
NPR ran a spot the next day that people around the state were so appalled at the blatant disregard for guidelines that hundreds sent pictures to Mike DeWine's office. I have written to both the mayor of that town and to DeWine to express my concern.

I fear for the healthcare workers who will not be getting any break as the ""flatline"" looks ready to spread and ooze across the next years. Is it too much to hope that those who prioritized snacks over the lives of others will also be electing to forgo medical care when they become sick? 

We need to get back to normal as soon as safely possible. But the people packing into crowds for ""fun"" without masks or social distancing are not reassuring any of us that they intend to take any of this seriously. Ultimately, it does not matter how careful we, as individuals, are if the person standing on either side of us has spent the weekend packed into crowds awaiting an ice cream cone.

He bases his policy decisions on the advice of his family and TV hosts. He publicly casts doubt on experienced advisors and scientists, lies and contradicts himself constantly, and tells his base that only he can stop the deep state out to get them. All of these things are just barely tolerable at a point in time when our economy is strong and things are business as usual.
     But when a real crisis comes along, and he continues doing the same things he did before - deflecting blame, pointing fingers, manipulating truth and disregarding public safety - the dangers of having such a peacetime president become blatantly apparent."

And yet -- we're open for business! The state governor (I was going to write ""our"" governor, but he's certainly alienated me from feeling any sense of solidarity with him or his backers) claims his decisions are based on ""science,"" but he must be enduring a massive amount of cognitive dissonance trying to reconcile his version of ""science"" with reality. Yes, Texas is large, and yes, we have quite a few large, rural counties with low population numbers. But the virus is starting to spread there, too, and there are hotspots in rural counties where slaughterhouses and prisons exist. Meanwhile, in our city, constructions sites are starting to turn into hotspots. The city council tried to shut them down, but the building lobby got to the governor, and within four days, the city was overruled and construction went on. Now these sites are spreading the virus. Why is this happening? Because the Richie Riches of Texas don't want the state to pay unemployment benefits so that people can stay home and stay safe.

You have to be a nerd with your own spreadsheet to know what’s actually going on. Most Georgians don’t want to have to take the time to do that, others don’t know how. THIS IS DISINFORMATION, may as well be taking a sharpie to a NWS forecast map, the purpose of which is to make the state look like it’s ready to reopen. 
  
In Hall County, cases have increased by 239%, from 649 cases on 4/20, to 2,202 cases as of today at 9am. (Deaths increased by 344%, from 9 to 40).

In the past week alone, Georgia has added 3,500 cases, 180 deaths, and 700 hospitalizations. 18 counties have >1% of the entire population infected. 3 days ago, there were only 15 counties.

With floods or without...

To be allowed to vote is a basic right of all people who are 18. Hereabouts (NW Europe) we have the choice to do so in physical absence - if we prefer that. We just have to ask for a digital/mail ballot sheet.
We do not need to give a reason for that wish.

People may be on vacation (not likely now, I agree),  highly pregnant, chronically ill, unenchanted, too lazy to walk up to the next voting office, or have a bad hair day.

If they ask for it in advance they can vote. EVERYONE.

Maybe that is because we still trust our voting systems (not based on stancing machines). And because we would never tolerate an obviously corrupt  third rate reality tv character to run our countries (with some exceptions to the east and south:)

I still see the scenario that the stable genius will do anything to postpone the due de-election, btw."

To top it off, the GOP and the President see no need to continue financial assistance to any out of work Americans on the grounds that doing so will encourage government dependency.  What is it called when large, rich corporations run screaming to the government for money to bail them out if not dependence on the government's largesse aka taxpayer dollars?

As for the religious schools and other religious institutions; when it comes to this crisis, they ought to be subject to the same restrictions the rest of us are under.

The real issue with the courts is that lawyers need to be able to file new matters and that the courts need to move to 100% electronic filing like the federal courts. We need OCA reform, not court reform. The courts of elected judges put the right judge in the right court. OCA on the other hand, while it is supposed to support those judges, thinks it is managing the judges, and it is doing a horrible job at both - especially with respect to the pandemic.

The second is to address misinformation.

Sadly, our president is the leader in that arena.

I'd recommend channeling ones frustration in a different direction and address this misinformation every opportunity your have.  We're seeing how powerful messaging can be (both good and bad).  When someone writes or says (or parrots) something that is patently false or ill-informed, you've got to address it.  At this stage, it's our responsibility, just like wearing a mask is.

Voters have the choices of mailing the ballots in or dropping them at municipal collection points. If a voter does not want to vote in these two ways, he or she may vote in person at greatly reduced numbers of live voting points with long lines caused by monitored and enforced social distancing - in masks. Finally, all mail-in ballots must be received by a specific date that will ensure they are scanned in and registered no later than the final election day. Results are not published until the actual deadline for counts of all ballots. This process is legal and steadfastly enforces one vote per one person, the only qualication being that you must be registered to vote. Illegal citizens will not receive a ballot in any of these cases - they cannot vote if not registered. This encourages immigrants to come out and register. Voting is an honor as well as a citizen's duty. General voting is mandated on a certain day by the Constitution of the United States. Trump may blow steam as much as he wants, this cannot be changed.

Because this is the same type of RNA vaccine used for SARS and MERS with disastrous consequences, including death. That related coronavirus vaccine, when tested on ferrets, had great results in developing antibodies to the disease. For the industry, antibodies equals immunization, which is not true. When the ferrets were exposed to the wild virus with their robust antibody response, the result was an ""enhanced immune response"" (""pathogenic priming"") and most of them died. The same was true with related vaccines (championed by Bill Gates, by the way) and tested on children in Africa. Many got sick and a number of them died. And Dr. Fauci, because of the big rush, is pushing for something like this to skip animal testing and go straight to humans, with no proper safety testing. Is what you want to be subjected to via mandatory vaccination? The history is clear: so far no vaccine for RNA virus has worked."

It may be a question of who will take the blame at election time for the slowed economy. 

Will it be those who wanted to re-open faster but were prevented, or those who are blamed as preventing it?

Sure, that question is unfair. That does not change its potential political impact, which depends on what voters believe on Nov 3, not on what is true."

But they have to qualify relative to the number of Covid cases, deaths, and hospital censuses.  There is a fine line between lives and livelihoods, more to the point, they are interdependent.  But lives take precedence.  Frankly, I feel secure when businesses which allow curb-side transactions still require us to stand 6 feet apart and wear masks.  What is the problem with that?

2020-05-20 18:01:12,"Conceptually, the preventive measures and solutions are very straight-forward:  A huge advanced effort in January through March to ramp up tracking, tracing and isolation, and procure and stockpile protective equipment, may have minimized deaths and the locations and duration of any lockdown.  (See, e.g., South Korea)

Having failed that, what was required to ""flatten"" the growing curve and prevent collapse of the healthcare system was massive and prolonged lockdowns, which prevented an explosion of cases but also resulted in a massive loss of economic activity and increase in unemployment.

And the rush to ""re-open"" is incorporating the same mistakes.  Rushing to re-open without concern for worker safety, through effective tracking, tracing and isolation.  So now workers will give up the discomfort of not having a paycheck for the daily discomfort of not knowing if they are bringing a deadly disease back home to their families.

Why is this not news?  No one knows the balance between reducing morbidity and maximizing economic activity.  Isn't Georgia's experience a key piece of information to answer this question?

I realize Trump is a fool and his promotion of hydroxychloroquine is not just a waste of resources and time but also compromising the public health but doesn't the media have some responsibility to restrain itself and report news that matters? 

Furthermore, an evaluation of all we've done right is in order. We've tested nearly 13 million people, every other democracy has tested significantly fewer than 4 million. Our mortality rate is roughly half every other democracy (only Israel's is better-accounting for lower flu deaths Germany is in a statistical tie).  We have 5 times more cases per million as Canada but a mortality rate 2% lower.  So much for single payer medicine.  And any of you Bernie supporters want to kick the pharmaceutical industry why you ride on its back?  I didn't think so.

So far data shows we can safely start to reopen the economy and the government can't print a trillion dollars a week indefinitely.  The WHO is of no benefit to us, Operation Warp Speed will develop a vaccine if it is to be developed.

Vermont has controlled the spread but far Northern Vermont is very different from southern Vermont and as the Times has pointed out even in NYC eight miles is sometimes a galaxy away for a covid19 virus. Science produces many models but the complexity produces an infinite number of variables. I was delighted to see Thomas Friedman entering the world of science in his current op-ed.
I am horrified to see all 50 states reopen to some degree as here in Quebec we are divided by different Universities running their regional health, education and welfare.Even Walmart has its own regional components; try making biscuits with flour from a northern supermarket.
WHO which has its hands tied because of the different interests of the USA and China is performing miracles in Africa where the politics threatened disaster but health became the singular issue.

So long as testing capacity lags, data reporting lags, they can just tell the public pleasing lies. The public is already engaged in a lot of wishful thinking of its own.

According to Johnathan Nez, Navajo Nation President, widespread testing is the reason for the high number of infections. It’s refreshing to hear from someone who’s more concerned about the people he’s been chosen to serve than he is about hiding the facts to save a political future. 

Despite all his claims to the contrary, Donald Trump is very afraid of that kind of testing. The robust economy has been his saving grace. If the rest of the U.S. tested as the Navajo Nation has, Trump’s push to get America back to work would fall flat on its face. 

Moreover, some Republican governors are equally fearful. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis fired the person responsible for the creation and maintenance of the state’s real-time Covid-19 reporting website. According to reports, she refused to manipulate the data to make a stronger case for reopening Florida. 

While President Nez acknowledges serious factors contributing to the virus’ proliferation, he has stepped up and is taking responsibility.

NYT Editors might inquire of McConnell (and confirm with Nancy Pelosi) just how many of the House bills he has brought up for discussion and a vote in the Senate over the past three years. If Senate is doing the business of the people, that would mean Mitch McConnell is doing his job by moving forward every House bill to committee and discussion and to a Senate vote. Facts matter, and the fact is that Mr. McConnell will not permit discussion of any bill that enhances the lives of working people, any bill that reinstates or expands voting rights, any bill that expands employee rights, as well as any bill that touches upon immigration, immigrant rights, health care, and the litany goes on and on. The fact is that Mr. McConnell's job has actually been to block any bills that help Americans become more equal, especially in terms of race, voting rights, and worker rights. And the basis for this is simple: to keep power in white men's hands."

The US lock down's greatest success was stopping Covid from overwhelming our health delivery systems and that was a success but at what cost? It destroyed our economy, laid Trillions of debt dollars at the feet of our children and only delayed the inevitable. The only thing that will end this Pandemic is herd immunity or a vaccine.

The approach going forward should be social distancing, face masks, quarantine hot spots, completely end the lock down, including children returning to school and come to the reality that this virus cannot be beaten by anything but herd immunity or a vaccine..

And they risked (and in many cases gave) their lives not to enrich their own bank accounts but to protect other people from far away lands. People they have never met before, people that even professed a different religion, people that in most cases didn’t even speak the English language. Why is it that now we can’t act in a humane way and protect the lives of our own people and at the same time, when the invisible enemy we have to confront today has been defeated, make our lives fully flourish again? Not just “the economy” and not just our respective bank accounts but all the aspects of our collective lives: the businesses, the science, the arts, the education, the relationships with family and friends… Yes, we can do it and we have shown before that we can achieve all that and more.

On top of Trump's self-serving and corrupt zeitgeist, we're in an era of global disarray and hostility, a direct result of Trump's mindless will-to-power and fight and fright political agenda enabled by his army of true believers and cynical opportunists who, like Trump, are at war with the very idea of a shared humanity and the fate of the earth.

Trump has triggered a human climate change arguably as catastrophic as global warming.

It may be a cliche to call Covid-19 the Trump Virus but as a metaphor it is precise and salient.  We may yet develop a vaccine at ""warp-speed"" and the pandemic may just miraculously disappear; but the fissures and fractures wreaked upon our world and among us is the real and more significant pandemic.

When logic, reason, wisdom, science, history, facts, truth, reality, etc, etc, are not only relegated to the level of ""opinions"" - one no better than another - but actively denigrated by a large minority of the population, you are in serious trouble.

When this kind of intellectual poison is allowed to fester, experts are dismissed as ""traitors"", scientists are part of the ""deep state"", and the main stream media becomes ""the enemy of the people"". And then anything is possible.

And when I say anything, I don't mean in a good way, as in, ""We could travel to Mars!"". I mean in a very dangerous and deadly way. As in, ""poor people"" or ""immigrants"" or some other marginalized group can suddenly become ""the reason"" for any bad thing those in power would like them to be.

And yet, the study's estimates that from 34,000 to 54,000 fewer Americans would have died by May 3 if social distancing had started one or two weeks earlier actually understates that impact in several ways:
1. Most obviously, because the study only ran through May 3, tens of thousands more lives have been lost.
2. In addition, the study does not take account of the full toll, which is reflected in excess deaths this year compared to past years. Those excess deaths exceed the official count by as much as 50 percent. 
3. A competent president dedicated to doing their job and listening to the experts, unlike Trump, would have taken other life-saving steps beyond instituting social distancing.
4. Such steps would have included a national test-and-trace effort that would be helping us to get this under control much faster. Instead, Trump is encouraging everything to open up prematurely, leading to a likely explosion of cases and deaths."

This article about the new modeling by the team of epidemiologists at Columbia University is fascinating in its demonstration that had control measures been initiated just a week or two earlier, thousands of lives would have been saved.

Well, looking at the models, it seems half of those lives were in New York City.

I think you grossly overestimate your ability to implement policy and save lives.  If you locked down a week earlier, most people would have wondered why we were locking down and would have continued going out like normal.  During that week, I was planning a trip and many of my friends and family thought I would be a wimp to cancel it.  By the middle of that week, the USA had crossed 2000 cases and people were starting to realize that we were definitely going into lockdown and panic.  They still had hopes of reopening in April.  The following week as lockdowns started, people still went out a lot as they got ready to go on lockdown.  Students were still going on spring break and people were still going to the beaches.  In order to lockdown, people needed that moment when coronavirus started to become serious and another week or so from there to properly lockdown.  There was an adjustment period.  No one would have locked down a week earlier.  They would have balked at the suggestion."

The curve of that graph continues and eventually slopes down. With increased social distancing measures, the peak is lower but the deaths happen at a steadier rate. Bottom line is that deaths are not PREVENTED, they are DELAYED. 

Remember “flatten the curve”? Have you forgotten why we locked down in the first place? More social distancing measures leads to a LONGER outbreak with a lower death rate, it ends up with the same number of deaths. The only lives that are saved by increased social distancing are those who are allowed hospital space that would’ve not had such opportunity had the social distancing not taken place. That only happens when the distancing leads to hospitals staying under capacity when they would’ve otherwise not had space for patients

Since no hospitals have been over run by the virus, NONE, increased distancing efforts should not decrease death rate for the entire pandemic. Yes they decrease it in the short term, but that does not matter nearly as much as who dies by the end of the year.

FLATTEN. THE. CURVE. Thats what we can do. We cannot decrease the area under the curve, which is the total deaths, which is the data that actually matters.

And if they do start coming around and believing the truth that we are just under 96,000 confirmed US deaths right now, they will say that some other super common malady like athlete's foot kills that many in a month.

When the virus touched the U.S. mainland, I was initially under the impression that the Trump administration would set an example as to how effectively the virus should be dealt with, by announcing complete lock down and enforcing social distancing. I thought the U.S., given its advanced technology in every field, and more so in medical research, would apply more pragmatic and scientific way and contain the spread of virus in a short span of time. Alas! The administration just did the opposite, stunning the world. The administration was slow to announce lock down. Trump even sided with the protesters who were against the Governors that imposed lock down. I just don't get the logic at all. How could a President act against the interests of the citizens who he is supposed to protect?

What is the benchmark? Number of hospitalizations. So instead of trying to avoid avoidable deaths, they are only trying to avoid deaths due to hospitals being overwhelmed.  They have set an acceptable number of people to be sacrificed for the sake of business/ideology.  Perhaps they will come to their senses before we reach hospital overwhelm, but we have no idea because there is no transparency to the decision-making process when the stated rationale is not supported by data/logic and the reported numbers are suspect.

Will the increased suicides, murders, deaths from delayed medical treatment, poverty, domestic violence and other causes be considered Covid related too?  If the economy goes into a Great Recession, millions, not thousands into the next decade will die, caused by the shutdown. Protect the ill and elderly, and open the economy.  More people under 65 have died from avoidable non related Covid deaths than covid related in the last 2 months. Lots more. Everyone mocked Florida’s reaction to the virus compared to the response by Cuomo and other governors that tried to protect everyone, instead of those of high risk. Compare the results in NY.

Current deaths (as of Monday) in that county: 1,839. Do the math to get a death rate/infection of one-half of one percent (1 person in 200, most often very elderly, who could be kept inside and shielded, and reduce that death rate further), and remember that 367,000 is from a month ago, and certainly higher now.

And it’s not just older, retired people we’ve lost. Children have suffered the loss of mothers and fathers, and families are now torn apart and wondering how they will go on.

What the modeling does do, however, is provide data for Governors to use in deciding how to respond, as some of them will inevitably be required to do, to a marked increase in infections in crowded corners of their states.  

In particular, the estimate of 36,000 deaths that wouldn't have happened had the the U.S.acted a week or so earlier, is a stark reminder to governors, that if they are faced with a spike in new cases, days matter -- a great deal.

Now The Times reveals that 80% of those 80 and over, put on ventilators died. And 70% between 70 and 80.

The majority of those are either very elderly and/or obese/hypertensive. If we can keep the very elderly and co-morbid safe and isolated, death rate can go below that of typical influenza, while life goes on. We have learned what we need to do.

But there are 10's of millions of us who can't WFH and who don't have a gov't job or are collecting a benefits check of some kind.

Hindsight is 20/20, but if I were in the shoes of President Trump or Governor Cuomo on March 1st, I cannot say for certain that I would have moved to shut down the economy either. These two executives, despite their differences, are the same in one key respect: neither had sufficient information to know with certainty how the virus would proliferate, and both knew exactly what would happen if they shut down the economy. I doubt that many readers have ever been in a position where millions are counting on him or her to make brutally difficult decisions in the people's interest. When choosing between a grave but potential threat and a guaranteed  catastrophe, a prudent executive will not kill the power without proof. That evidence just wasn't there by March 1st. Ruminating on what could have been - especially quibbling over ten days - is not only unable to change what happened, it overlooks the true nature of the executive burden. Every life lost to COVID-19 is a painful tragedy, and each person deserves to be remembered. But criticizing the exact date of the response, rather than deficiencies within our control such as lack of preparation, will only serve to reinforce how thankless a job being a leader is. Instead, we must rally. We mourn together, we help our neighbors and local businesses get back up, and we make sure the we are prepared for the next threat."

That said, with this information many of them are deciding to force people back to work, and refusing to enforce mask wear and other simple but proven precautions against what seems like common sense."

The problem with Trump is that he will not adhere to any advice given by experts.

New York city and metro area governments have done a good job of creating and maintaining on-street bicycle infrastructure in most neighborhoods, but much more needs to be done in the way of dedicated off-street infrastructure. What is sometimes referred to as cycling 'freeways'.

The Mario Cuomo bridge path from Nyack to Tarrytown that was supposed to open last fall still isn't operational due to local government opposition in Tarrytown. Construction still hasn't started on a 9 mile rail-trail extension from Englewood NJ north to the NY state line that has had all approvals and funding in place for over a year. In Manhattan the section of the heavily trafficked westside greenway multi-use path from 100th to 125th st. is wholly inadequate, unsafe, and in a state of disrepair. It was due to be temporarily closed for renovations earlier this year but apparently this has been delayed.

Transportation by bicycle may be a small percentage but it has been steadily growing year over year and will certainly continue to do so. It's time that the commitment to real and complete bicycle infrastructure followed suit."
2020-05-19 14:07:37,"Craigslist?  Facebook Marketplace?

Used bicycles are awesome."
2020-05-19 14:29:38,"This is wonderful news.

I grew up in a mountain town in Colorado where cycling is common, but spent a decade in the deep south over my late 20s to early 30s, where I was one of the few cyclists commuting every day.

I loved it - being free from the congestion of traffic and the stress of parking, getting a shot of exercise, smelling the morning air and witnessing sunrises unimpeded from the glass and steel cabin of a car.  When I would arrive at work, colleagues would frequently wonder why I would be grinning ear-to-ear like a fool, even when covered in rain, mud, and the occasional abrasion.

About five years ago, I started working from home, but I still use my bike for groceries (I wear a camping backpack to haul my food home) and odd trips around the city.  

Community bike co-ops (not retail bike stores) are great: their volunteers and staff are generally very passionate about cycling and will want to get you riding safely, cheaply, and quickly.  I haven't bought an expensive bike in a very long time - the one I'm riding on now was assembled from spare parts at one of these bike co-ops ... I've spent maybe $150 on it, total, after new tires and cables.

Wear a helmet, ride considerately, but go for it, folks!  Aside from the benefits of physical exercise, reducing the stress of traffic and parking, and the spiritual rewards of being immersed in nature, cycling (as a replacement for car travel) is subversive: it demonstrates that we can live without so many fossil fuels."

On Facebook, we have a local group, for folks trying to buy or sell stuff, and I noticed just in the past week or so, a big uptick in bicycles both for sale and being sought after. I suspect the warmer weather and people coming out to their vacation homes (and those who literally relocated from the big city to here full-time since March) realize bikes are a great way to get around, for pleasure riding and to avoid lines of traffic and for their kids to use). And I’m sure “used” bikes are less money than newer fancy ones... another benefit all around for everyone!"
2020-05-19 14:46:35,"People should also consider ""trikes'.    I am 64 and after a bad bicycle accident, I have metal in my spine and hips.   Hitting the pavement would be not be good.   So I decided to bite the bullet and get a trike for stability.   What fun!   Not as good as a bike, and I had to get over the fact i may look a little silly, but I am am totally enjoying the local bike trail and my little dog sits in the basket.   I have decided life is too short to worry about what others think!
The trike is a Schwinn and was about $400 on Amazon.   A great mood lifter during lock down when the streets are quiet."

2020-05-19 15:24:51,"If you are standing at the park behind Ikea in Red Hook and look across the Erie Basin you will see a city lot full of presumably impounded bikes and motorcycles.  I think it is time the city allows some of these Mom & Pop bike shops access to the bikes and allow them to be repaired and either sold or donated or perhaps sold for charity funds for a greater cause.  They are sitting out there rusting let's put them to use. Also, I personally love the dream of a future New York City with less cars on city roads and miles of pavement closed for bikes and pedestrian traffic only.  Our glorious city was once New Amsterdam (68% of all traffic in Amsterdam is bicycles) so why not get back to our Dutch roots and become a city of cyclists."

2020-05-19 16:00:22,"Ha!  I've been a commuter bicyclist since 2008 when we sold our second car in recession belt-tightening.  Never looked back, nor have I wanted to.  Biking to work wakes me up at the beginning of the day and helps me de-stress on the way home. Every bike ride is a thousand time better than being in a car. Even in Phoenix with it's extreme summer heat - it's not like people are excited about getting in a car when it's 116F either.  Parking?  Wherever I please.  The price of gas?  I have no idea.  Maintenance cost? Maybe $100 annually?  Safety? I feel safer biking on surface streets than I do navigating our freeways.  

I'm not alone in this either.  I know a lot of people who made the switch during the Great Recession for purely economic reasons but never missed their car.  Many of us have successfully advocated for increased funding for infrastructure supporting safer streets and roads for bicyclists and walkers of all stripes.  I will not abandon public transportation though, especially light rail, which I often combine with biking for longer trips.  Auto emissions and development catering to the car-culture have created their own set of public health emergencies."
2020-05-19 16:11:20,"I shopped for a bike online in early April. It did not go well. 

Websites said call the store. Stores said use the website. The drill was medieval by shopping standards. I didn’t feel like risking my health to enter the crowded Walmart. I ordered one online from Walmart to pick up the next day, only to get an email saying out of stock. 

When I scored one online at Amazon, it promised a month’s wait. Then I hedged my bet with a second. 

The second arrived first, so I cancelled the first (which had disappeared, then reappeared) online. 

The bike assembly baffled my husband, so we found a bike store and delivered it there for $125 assembly ... and a delivery date of June 4. 

My first choice ($150 bike) has morphed into a $600 bike. 

I’ll probably fall off, but I have a helmet. Actually, I have two. Amazon sent two by mistake..."

If they are out of stock, they may be able to special order your dream bike from one of their suppliers. Bike shops only keep a limited inventory on the sales floor, and often times there is a bigger well to pull from—you just have to ask. This has certainly been an unusual spring, and I know many companies are low on inventory, but because of the way the bike year works, any shops that didn't take their original inventory from their suppliers will have those bikes released back to the suppliers, meaning there is more inventory than some people think...again you just need to ask. I'm hopeful that this trend keeps ticking up. It's great to see more people on bikes of all kinds!"

He’s been a bike guy in our town for 30  years and until the pandemic, was leading weekly group challenge rides. My husband and I have purchased 5 bikes from him as we have traded up in features (and skills!). 

I will STRONGLY ECHO the “wear a helmet” advice, even if you are just going for a short neighborhood ride. Wear it properly, snugly, in the correct position. Last June I fell while on a solo neighborhood ride, less than a mile from home. I wasn’t going fast, and nothing else was involved. I don’t even know how it happened TBH. I landed flat on my face, the forehead of my helmet saved me from facial or brain damage. I then rag dolled across the road with equipment flying everywhere. Luckily another bike rider going the other direction helped me to the curb, and a truck stopped to pick up my bike. 

I went to the ER where they did xrays and CT scan for possible concussion (I had one) and broken bones, of which I had none. Even the ER doc was amazed that nothing was broken. We have great private insurance as the $13k ER bill would have been catastrophic w/o it. It’s taken me almost a year to get comfy on my bike, but I love riding so I stuck with it. Buy the helmet.

I'm one of the lucky ones.  For most it was a short lived fad.  I fear the same will happen again unless we take advantage of this opportunity to change our roadway infrastructure.

Without intending to, people will also lose weight!

But cyclists must be safety- and socially conscious to get the best out of the cycling experience. Please let me pass along some tips:

- Buy your bike from a bicycle shop near where you live, not from a department store. Your local shop will configure  your new bike to your needs, service it, and provide expert advice
- Don't cheap out -- a quality bike costs $500 
- Have your shop ""fit"" you to your new bike, optimizing its comfort and efficiency
- Take a safe cycling course -- your shop will tell you where to find one close to you
- Wear a helmet, the most important thing you can do to avoid injury if you crash
- Mount always-on lights front and rear so you will be more visible
- Obey the laws and treat drivers and other cyclists with courtesy
- Learn how to use the gears to take the effort out of climbing hills
- Buy a good lock and use it every time
- On your days off, discover places to ride recreationally. Get the family involved -- kids are natural cyclists
- Don't overdo mileage or effort when starting out -- it takes a few weeks for your body to adjust
- Wipe that goofy grin off your face when you get to work. Sedentary co-workers will not understand"
2020-05-19 22:25:57,"The only downside of course, is that car and truck drivers still have little respect for cyclists. Which makes cycling on the road very dangerous in the DC metro area.

The Purple Line light rail is heading to $6 billion in costs in Maryland, yet the existing Capital Crescent bike trail next to it could be extended for a fraction of the cost ($120 million) and have close to the same ridership (in the design plans it will be next to the train on a dedicated path for a lot of it, although they chopped thousands of trees down which provided shade on the CC which is still annoying)."
2020-05-20 01:22:48,"I have been commuting by bicycle through three of the five boroughs for the last 20 years. And I highly recommend bicycle-commuting to anyone who is in a position to do it.

But it needs to be said: Riding a bicycle in the 5 boroughs of NYC is not unlike swimming in the ocean. It can be exhilarating, but you have to keep your wits about you and recognize the potential for danger.

And for those of you who will be getting on a bicycle for the first time in a long time: Your left-hand brake stops your front tire and your right-hand brake stops your rear tire. You should always try to apply the rear brake first. Bad things happen when the front tire stops and the rest of the bicycle does not.

Good luck, and HAVE FUN."
2020-05-20 02:45:36,"I'm glad that more people are looking at cycling but let's not forget that NYPD hates everything 2 wheels. Constant harassment and ticketing of cyclists are rampant in the city. Yes there are people who rides without much care for traffic rules, blowing through reds, going down the wrong way and forcing others into the cars but the cops only go after the nice cyclists who is naive enough to stop because they did nothing wrong. Same on a motorcycle. Cops don't go after the dirt bike crew wheelie-ing their non-street legal bikes and quads down the street but instead harass the nice motorcyclists every spring for minute things like not having a reflective bolt on their license plate or having a helmet camera all in the name of vision zero. Meanwhile if you drive a car in NY it seems like to can get away with murder. Hopefully because of an increase of cyclists population cops can learn to enforce better and we can all learn to better respect one another on the road."

As I have an intimidating hill on the route home, the electric assist has extended my biking for as long as I am able to balance on a bike. 
I have been to the Netherlands and to Denmark and have seen some pretty elderly folk on bikes, although not on hills. So, I have no plans to let my bike sit in the barn and retire any time soon. It is too much fun in a time when fun is in short supply."

2. REGULAR bait bike programs (not just once in a while and then forgotten)."

It's completely unsurprising that this article ignores bike ownership outside of major US cities-- San Francisco, Portland, NYC, Chicago, Seattle, and Phoenix are all mentioned, but no mention of the hundreds of smaller cities where this same phenomenon is happening. Even in relatively sleepy Huntsville, our 4 local bike shops have never been busier and the local greenways and riding paths have never been more crowded. We have a long way to go here before cycling becomes a primary mode of transportation-- it's too hot and we're too sprawly-- but every improvement helps."

Yes, bikes are in short supply. But please don’t buy a secondhand one unless the seller can prove they paid for it, or you REALLY trust them!"
2020-05-20 13:12:49,"Caveat Emptor!!
Almost all bicycles today, even those “American” brands like Trek, Specialized and other legacy American companies utilize critical components made in China to save production costs. Those parts, like bearings, are made of cheap plastic that wear out in a fraction of the time that they used to. 
The so-called “low-end” bikes costing a few hundred dollars are all made in China and the frames and components - chains, cassettes, derailleurs - are substandard. Expensive bikes costing several thousands of dollars can still have frames made domestically but again their guts are made in China. 

My first bike was my brother’s hand-me-down 3-speed English racer and it lasted forty years before it was stolen. Never needed repair except lubrication. My 1967 steel Peugeot would still be here if it too was not stolen. I still have my 1995 Trek - made 100% in Wisconsin before the company outsourced manufacturing to China and their subsequent models that I own just don’t have the durability. Not picking on Trek - they are a wonderful company. But it’s the same with all brands. 

Can’t you all see that we have sold ourselves to China for a handful of beans? Just like our critical pharmaceutical industry, we need to restore domestic production, even if it costs more. We “saved” money in the short run by outsourcing, but sowed the seeds of our own destruction in the long run by doing so."

2020-05-20 15:22:56,"As a lifelong cyclist, I hope they are also selling helmets along with these bikes and informing people of the laws and rules of the road. While I’m happy to see more people enjoying bicycling, my area is swamped with clueless, dangerous new riders. Not good.

2020-05-19 12:18:59,"I'm genuinely puzzled. I don't understand why people keep talking about this and writing about it as if it's all over--not just in Wuhan, but anywhere. There's no immunity, no effective treatment, no vaccine and probably not one that will be available anytime soon. And the virus is still spreading around the world. What am I missing? Is the goal to get the entire world to a stage at which we can just remain on permanent lockdown, stamping out outbreaks while the virus slowly makes its way through the population and otherwise sitting at home until all but a privileged few are poor and hungry? No, thank you."

2020-05-19 12:42:48,"One of the people in the story was correct in blaming the Wuhan authorities for being slow to react to a new illness.  It was not the fault of the Beijing Govt.    It was suggested to me by a Chinese person that people selling wild animal meat at the wet markets would have bribed local officials to turn a blind eye to what they were selling which had been previously banned by Beijing.  Such markets usually sell seafood, fowl and normal meat plus vegetables. (been to several over there).
Is it the new normal to worry - YES. We have no choice in the matter if we want to live.
Life will resume to something like normal but we will all have to maintain safe distances, especially during flu seasons.
In Australia we don't believe it is over, and our  lockdowns have been more severe than most in the US. We are now beginning to very slowly open businesses but if there is a rise we will return to lockdowns.  Schools here have been gradually getting back to normal, one-two grades at a time.
When all businesses start again some states are talking about graduated hours so streets & public transport are not overcrowded all at once and to last until the end of the year."
2020-05-19 13:25:48,"It won't take long for traffic to feel once again like a burden. There and everywhere including here in the US. We need an alternative to our overused autos, but also may need to look to reform our mass transportation systems to encourage safe social travel. Perhaps most easily, we can return to the bicycle and other variations of it."
2020-05-19 14:07:40,"These stories are so normal and uneventful that I believe Wuhan will be back to normalcy in no time.  

However, I cannot say the same to our own situation.  There are so many people lost their love ones.  Many jobs will probably never come back.  People will have lots of time to think about their own future.  Is it worthwhile to go back to work as if business is as usual?  Who will bail me out the next time when a crisis strikes? 

This will be the moment to change people's behavior and thinking.  If not, you will be doomed the next time around."
2020-05-19 15:40:06,"All of these stories are touching and speak to the diversity of reactions among ordinary Chinese to the crisis. Yet, I don’t think the stories are about being on the “other side”: the stories are about being in the middle of this coronavirus crisis in which there are no medical cures and no economic certainty. No one is out of the woods yet, and all the people in the article are bracing for the possibilities of exponential growth in cases and in deaths. Added to this is the new intensity of economic and political crisis brought on by suspicion and distrust of the Chinese government and Chinese companies. The sense I get is that this is, at best, a temporary respite and a weariness that even a greater crisis is awaiting to pounce. The stories are really about fear and anger and hunkering down and planning for escape."

They love their children, they love their food, parks, pets, family. They get mad at the things they can't control. Why we have to have such a argumentative, belligerent, and bristly posture towards that nation, while making absolutely no efforts at statecraft, elude me. It is counter productive."
2020-05-19 22:33:36,"I've been following the news the whole time on the pandemic story. It's a shame it all had to end up like this. I think it's sad that people blame China for it all. I hear people say things like I'll never eat at a Chinese buffet again or I'll never buy things made in China. I don't believe China is an enemy to the US nor do I want it to be that way. Many people may disagree. This is a problem the whole world has to face and it has changed facets of life everywhere. It's sad when a buffoon like our president is only stirring the pot and contradicting himself every 5 minutes. I'd like to see the US adopt some of the strategies China used for combating the virus. But is that happening? No, of course not. He's too busy blaming everyone and anyone else. Even Obama gets blamed. Really no one is at fault and the whole situation stinks. Sorry but I am not boycotting China and drinking the haterade that is ignorant to me. I hope the US and China can remain on friendly terms; enough lives have been lost."

Any corporation who’s hasn’t done well during the last 10 years, with all the cheap money being given away by the federal reserve, should not be rescued on the back of the American taxpayer.  Let those stock holders and executives who profited be the ones to guarantee the loans or grants or let the wall street firms leading the leveraged buyout craze take the losses.  They were willing to gamble when there was a potential for profit.  Apparently they need to be reminded that greed risks a potential for loss as well."

Keynes has told us what we should be doing now if we want to revive our economy. Is it asking too much to appoint a Treasury Secretary who's familiar with his writings? They don't call him ""Dim"" Mnuchin for nothing."

The government creates the money; we use it. They can create as much as they want and give it to anyone they want and nothing horrid happens. We have been doing it since the fed reserve was created, over a hundred years ago; we falsely call it the national debt and it grows and grows but means nothing. It is a bookkeeping matter only. We must watch out for inflation but no problem with that possible problem now. Alan Greenspan: famous economist and longtime head of the Federal Reserve Bank: ""There's nothing to prevent the federal government creating as much money as it wants."" Ben Bernanke, another one-time head of the Federal Reserve said the same thing. Paul Krugman, Nobel Laureate in Economics: ""The Fed government cannot go broke because it is in charge of and creates the money supply."" He went on-- ""we don’t have to worry about paying off the debt; we never will, and that’s OK.""
I'm not sure the writers here understand this."

Let American corporations get a taste of the 'free market' they pretend to admire for once in their hypocritical lives.

All corporations have done for the last 40 years is purchase public policy and tax-dodged while treating their workers like 7th-class citizens.

2020-05-19 14:55:59,"As one of the Senators said this a.m., the administration will throw more money at Wall Street and banks.  

Just like before, however, they will let the rest of Americans go under rather than send small payments through extended unemployment benefits and/or direct payments to families in the name of fiscal responsibility and the goal of keeping people hungry and desperate for work.

We all know for whom this administration works, and who they think are essential to the economy.   And it's not the cities and states and hospitals actually responding to this health crisis, nor is it the people actually out there right now doing the work."
2020-05-19 15:03:57,"Fear of risk is what drives bonds and the bond market. The safer bonds pay low returns; as the risk increases, so does the return, unless the principal goes bust. 

The Fed and Treasury have been given this money to make loans that the supply and demand curve would normally not support.  It seems to me that they are obliged to be less prudent than a normal investor who is simply trying to increase their wealth. I believe the current discussion is about how much less prudent they should be. If they acted like a normally prudent investor, there would be no reason for them to be in that business."
2020-05-19 15:12:02,"It is wise and good for the economy to diminish economic rescue efforts by refusing to rescue riskier companies.

Rescue of riskier companies is based upon the false notion that the status quo prior to the virus was optimum, or at least superior to what would be the status if riskier companies were not rescued.  Neither is the case.  12 years of ultra-low interest rates since the financial crisis has resulted in a great deal of mis-allocation of resources as low value businesses became profitable using enormous amounts of borrowed funds as such low rates.  As a consequence, efficiency has suffered.  And, it is economic efficiency (getting more output from the same resources) which enables prosperity and a better life for the population.

We would be better off if companies already in heavily indebted tenuous financial condition were let to fail.  Then as the economy rebounds, new companies will form which will be more efficient as well as more profitable, more able to pay competitive salaries, more able to supply goods and services at lower prices to the public."
2020-05-19 15:26:54,"How will America, the country that is borrowing trillions, be able to pay it's bills?  We are going to have to stop some spending.

The American military, the biggest socialist organization in the world, is a good place to start.  For many decades half of American taxes have gone to the military.  We are taxed to spend as much or more than the entire rest of the world pays for defense.

The U.S. could easily cut military spending in half.  We would still be paying far more than anyone else.  And still most of the other big spenders would be our allies - unless that changes under Trump."
2020-05-19 15:32:27,"It seems that the whole point of this exercise is for the Fed and Treasury to take on risk that normal investors would avoid because they would be likely to lose their money. 

So let them argue and decide how much risk to take on and how much of their principal they are willing to lose, and get on with it.

Meanwhile, the super low interest rates have destroyed the income from money markets and related instruments. Many small investors who rely on these to provide a portion of their monthly income are now spending their savings to pay their monthly expenses. They are bearing some of the burden of bailing out risky companies."
2020-05-19 16:06:33,"The Fed and the Treasury need to take a cautious approach and avoid ""saving"" companies that are not in essential industries and have not been prudent in their business plans.  
Companies that are healthy have many different options to raise funds in normal time, and many would not want to be hampered by the auditing process they would like to have to go through.
Those who are first in line for government loans are likely to be those who have difficulties borrowing even in a zero interest environment, or are in industries that are likely to face cataclysmic change in their way of  doing business in the age of Corona virus. ( e.g. casinos, buffet places,  air lines,  Amtrak, meat packing) and they may well have difficulties securing loans in the private market.  In the end, both financial and non-financial considerations would likely enter into whether a loan would be granted.  What we as citizens should be concerned with is whether the  process is reasonably independent from political consideration at the local and national levels."
2020-05-19 16:07:43,This concern about the government losing its investment is absurd. Do you know what happens when the government loses money?  It makes more!  Or it issues bonds and they buys them back. It's all just a bookkeeping exercise on a giant ledger. They should be spending whatever it takes to keep the country afloat. Inflation is not an issue when 30 million people are out of work.
2020-05-19 16:08:54,"""To be fair, it is hard to say what the ideal amount of risk-taking would look like.""

I can tell you one place to draw the line - junk bonds. Why is US Treasury allowing the Fed to buy the junk bonds of companies that were already going under before the pandemic? Some of these are small companies in the fossil fuel industry with no long-term future. Bailing them out is a waste of resources. Why? Cronyism?"

The healthcare system is being pushed beyond its ability to treat people. The long term effects of infection are still being discovered. Children are being infected in ways that are not fully understood. It is early days with this virus. There are many unknowns. But people continue to be infected and deaths continue to happen. Is the US prepared to risk lives so that its economy can restart? Is that acceptable??? It is not.

President Roosevelt would realize this is another time we need a program like his New Deal, with federal jobs for the unemployed. There is so much work that needs to be done--in our healthcare system; repairing our broken infrastructure;  even helping farmers harvest their crops so they don't have to be plowed under, then getting food to the hungry. And these new federal employees would then stimulate the economy with their spending.

Of course, the reason we are in this quandary is because the Administration refused to follow the lead of so many other countries, paying employees directly, thus absolving companies of the financial stress (and permanent national economic damage) of either meeting payroll or laying people off.  If we'd just done that this would not be the issue it is, and as an extra bonus ""reopening"" would be much smoother.  But the GOP would not do this because then they would not have control of who got the money."
2020-05-19 15:42:34,"With a panicked and stupidly reckless president  pushing states to reopen without meeting his own administration’s guidelines regarding infection rates, testing and contact tracing, this is certainly no time for Mnuchin to fret over losing essentially “bailout” money for Main Street Buisness allocated by a Congress making no profit/loss demands. The president’s insanely political behavior will likely result in more waves of infection, and the sooner the Treasury/Fed can robustly backstop Main Street Buisness, the more of them will be left standing when this nightmare is behind us.

Instead of trying to decide which businesses should be prevented from failing, we should be making sure American families are taken care of, and then leave it to the market to decide which businesses adapt successfully to this new reality we face. Isn't that the point of a market economy?

The federal government is blowing through current and future income on a top-down approach to the job market -- essentially the latest variation on Supply Side economics.  Taking care of the ""Job Creator Class,"" as Romney tried to spin it.

Meanwhile, the lower quartile of the workforce is damned.  They can't afford to shelter in place to ""flatten the curve,"" much less spend more money in the marketplace. 

Thinking about it from the bottom-up has become so alien to our way of thinking, I honestly doubt any of this even occurred to these task forces.  They're shoveling billions at business owners while sending pennies to families . . . and ultimatums to meat workers.

Hatred towards business is palpable in the Dem party these days (except when it comes time to run for office), and it's a daily rant from readers.  Apparently, no one wants a job.  Or perhaps they think jobs should just come from working for the government, or maybe jobs shouldn't exist at all.  We just sit home and wait for checks.  

The most important thing is to support business.  That's what the EU is doing, that's what responsible countries do, even irresponsible one's like China's CCP (although, the CCP basically controls business, so they're bailing themselves out).  Stop with this vitriol!  

If you don't like student debt - rant at Congress for allowing usury interest rates that started years ago.  

If you don't like the price of houses, tell Congress you're not happy with Fanny, Freddie, and other 'government' guaranteed policies that remove the risk from the big investor.  

If you don't like CEO pay, as Congress why that wasn't limited in the first bailout in 2009 and why the corporate executive pay that is supposed to be limited to company performance and is overseen by the big accounting firms is enforced.

If you don't like the public school outcomes, which are bad, ask the DOE why their focus is 'diversity' over education."

It is also right and proper to discuss how much risk the Fed and Treasury should take, but it's a foregone conclusion that they should take more risk than a prudent investor would. The whole point of this exercise is to mitigate the damage done by the virus, a black swan event that has rendered formerly good debt risky.

Their criteria for these loans should be based on how prudent the debt was before the coronavirus shutdown. If it was speculative and risky then, let it default. If it was good debt until then, buy it and take the risk, knowing that your portfolio will likely take some hits."
2020-05-20 00:30:54,"As with the immense tax cut that was passed and aimed primarily to benefit  the very wealthy and the big corporations ,  here too aid so far actually distributed was given primarily to the wealthiest and largest.  Of course all firms can use help in this economic maelstrom now engulfing us, but the smaller businesses have no chance of survival at all, if they are not presently surviving. In my area, the grocery stores are doing well, better than before, but the movie houses are dead.  So with all smaller business: if your product will not sell in a pandemic, then survival requires government intervention. And the smaller businesses are the ones who in total have the most workers, the most furloughed , the most needy.  If aid is withheld the very large can stagger along for a while, but  smaller need support now.  No reason not to give the aid  now to the smaller businesses."

The first clot, as it were, is the truly perverted misanthropy shown by (many) Republicans who say, ""if you give too much financial aid to the less fortunate, they'll just take the aid and stop working altogether."" (And go where?)

 Rand Paul is the most shameless advocate of this rendering of the poor as ""non-humans"" (his words) but there are many more in his cohort, libertarian and otherwise. So, let's not spend too freely —at least to ""those people"".

Evidently, though, the well-to-do are insatiable and yet immaculate; give them all they demand and they'll never stop working —for as long as their endeavors are government-subsidised.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that a pretty clear example of ""socialism""?"

Leaving that door ajar in the regulations opens the program for abuse and showering favors on the usual suspects.

To their credit, the Federal Government got this program up and running with terrific speed.   However, the rules didn't have nearly the same vetting process as usual.  Businesses were scared.  The Employees were scared.  The Feds were scared.  

The only real guidance was ""if you are worried about the future and have less than 500 employees, take this money and spend at least 75% of it on your staff's pay and benefits 
 If you don't spend it on staff, its a loan that you will need to pay back.""

The vast majority of businesses - even ones with a few hundred employees - looked at the rules and thought, ""we can access this program and help our people"".  

At a minimum, employees got another 8 weeks of pay.  The upside is that some of these employers will be able to ride out the storm and keep people employed in the future.

Also, Treasury has virtually eliminated the possibility of criminal action for those who took the loans to support real companies with real employees.  Their FAQ issued on May 13th (Question 46) spells it out.  They have realized that the sensational cases are rare.  In fact, in round two of the PPP 85% of the loans have been less than $100K."

The question of how many small businesses will have to file for chapter 11 due to not receiving aid in time is a completely different story, in part because there was not enough money to go around, and for another part because due to the way the bill was carelessly drafted, without peer review, and the administration too bureaucratic. 

Wall Street will certainly be all the merrier if publicly traded companies make it through this mess. They don't care about small privately owned businesses, and neither do their friends on Capitol Hill."

Personally, I see no difference between these so called ”public” companies and mom and pop when it comes to Wuhan virus catastrophe.

But since they do have access to the Wall Street - I hope Secretary Mnuchin means it and does audit folks with over $2 million.  

I suspect that audit will take place in year 2034 at the earliest - at which they will settle for pennies on the dollar.

As to small businesses - they deserve it.

I have a close friend in Lubbock, Texas who owns and operates a number of franchise dry cleaning stores.

Trump childish behavior re the WHO and other similar organizations (including NATO) should be one important topic of such interrogation sessions right now. I am sure that those intelligent Republicans that are out there will agree that attacking, deprecating, threatening, and not funding the very same organizations that our country worked so hard to create after the end of WWII (instead of assuming a prevalent leadership role in those same organizations) is, at least, counterproductive and represents a clear admission that our country can not longer lead the free world and is renouncing to the role vested onto our country by all our allies after the end of WWII.

As exemplified by the $1.5 trillion tax cut that benefited the 1%, our form of government is completely riddled with corruption. I'm amazed any time I see a pothole get fixed despite the massive need for infrastructure repairs. Stock buybacks are far more important (sic) than masks, ventilators, and repairs to bridges and highways. 

These bailouts are rapidly debasing (weakening) the US dollar. Despite Trump lies to the opposite, you cannot keep printing dollars without some impact to the US dollar's status as reserve currency.

In fact, it was the Trump administration that let things get so bad that this scale of economic damage was possible. They did nothing for months, and now we have to risk our lives to save the economy in a hurry?

This money goes directly back into the economy.  These people are able to keep stimulating the economy with the same spending level before the virus.  (don't forget some people lost their employer healthcare insurance and now have to pay for it out of unemployment pay.)

The Repubs are mad with the bailout to middle class and want them back at work but ok with the millions that went to their donors.  So they are forcing states to reopen by supporting and encouraging protesters.

Even the Trump economic stimulus is a disaster - Once again he is trying to help out his Billionaire cronies instead of Americans in need.

The blame game continues. Trump is blaming WHO now, and it is obvious he is trying to set up blue states for the poor economy.  A good president would not have to keep pointing fingers at others like Trump does."
2020-05-19 15:54:21,"The great recession destroyed a lot of lives. Older people saw their retirement funds diminish, and did not have enough time to capture what they would have earned without the crash. Many older people  never returned to the workplace in their previous status or income. Young college grads saw their opportunities plummet. Whole industries like retail, began their descent into oblivion. The rich scooped up depressed homes and apartment buildings and raised rents to unfathomable amounts when the economy finally up-ticked. When things finally improved it appeared we were in a boom. This was a facade--  this economy crashed at the outset of Cova 19-- revealing the vulnerability of most people to just the slightest waver. I am not sure what the answer is, but I know what is not: returning the economy to full throttle. Lots of people are NOT going to eat out with the regularity they did. There will not be as many places to shop and many either don't have the money to spend aimlessly, or have decided they just don't want more than necessities. We need a reboot-- to what I don't know. But neither does any member of this corrupt and ignorant administration. Rough seas ahead."
2020-05-19 15:54:25,"""Mnuchin warns prolonged state closures could cause ‘permanent’ damage.""
I've been posting about this in the NYT over the past 2 months. This generic shutdown was wrong.  It was the right decision for NYC and other areas with large population density where people need to use public transportation to commute. But it made not sense for upstate NY. 
What good is receive a $1200.00 check if you cannot find supplies.  
Whoever can work from home, please work from home. Avoid public transportation. Wear masks and gloves.  Be smart

2020-05-19 15:54:30,"A few thoughts...It is impossible to open and bring the economy back when one is six feet under. The all or nothing approach of forging ahead “ with or without a vaccine” is not helpful. Also, the current administration’s persisting with its conspiracy theories and divisive red vs. blue state tribal politics. These kind of distractions are a waste of time and doesn’t do anything to promote a positive outcome for the American people to survive this pandemic."

2020-05-19 15:55:13,"If the economy is going to be damaged by further shutdown, why doesn't the Trump administration increase testing and PPE production and root out this virus the way South Korea and Germany and other places have done?  You can force open the economy and create rebellions, but people may still be too scared to participate.  You have to address root causes."
2020-05-19 15:55:16,Is society a tool of the economy? I would have hoped it was the other way round.
2020-05-19 15:55:21,The economy may open under restricted conditions that take into account social distancing and face masks and other recommended protections. But it will be a struggle. The majority of the public will place a higher priority on health over commerce.Until there is an effective vaccine the economy and the public will continue to struggle on a daily basis.
2020-05-19 15:56:22,"Mnuchin is absolutely correct that it is important to begin bringing people back to work in a safe way. Ongoing financial support will also clearly be needed, because for at least some initial coming months many businesses will necessarily operate at a much reduced capacity and will therefore be unable to sustain the level of activity needed to restore the economy. Business leaders should be focused on how to adapt to perform optimally under the evolving circumstances, which means new business models that make genuinely safe economic activity possible. Some businesses will reopen successfully, others will open by cutting corners that jeopardize the reopening for everyone, still others will not reopen ever again, and some will truly innovate to become something different than they ever were or would have been. It's a transformational time, that calls for transformational approaches -- meaning great business leadership which is, unfortunately, in short supply."
2020-05-19 15:58:32,"In an alternative universe (only perceptible to this administration and its base), we're all out here just WISHING for a never-ending lockdown: We love it and really hope there's permanent damage to the economy.

No. We want it over, and are waiting for robust federal testing and contact tracing programs. But, of course, that would require some initiative and competence. We will get neither, so settle in for a smattering of focus-grouped rhetorical strategies."
2020-05-19 15:58:39,"In the face of the Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic that has cost thousands of additional, lives, Trump wants to try to ""save"" the economy at the expense of an even greater number of unnecessary deaths.  

The opportunities to spare the economy further damage were lost when Trump devastated the CDC pandemic capacity in 2018, and when he and his incompetent circle ignored all the early warnings of the COVID pandemic by failing to scale up testing, tracking and introduce quarantine as needed. 

Now Trump wants to restart the economy risking a resurgence of the pandemic which will , in the long run, harm our economy more than we can imagine.   This nation is now suffering more under the Trump administration than all other disasters we have faced in history!"

2020-05-19 15:09:06,"Bail out We the People.

Money in Our Treasury belongs to Us, not global banks or global shareholders. 

Every Trillion dollars given to global banks is $3,000 from EVERY Citizen ($12,000 from a family of four) of Our money from Our treasury. The Federal Reserve gave away a net of $3 Trillion to global banks (after repaying loans) in just one program (QEII) after 2008, so it's not like the Fed doesn't give away free money.

We the People know where that money needs to go better than mega-rich shareholders (many of whom don't live or pay taxes in the USA).

Money trickles UP, not down. If every citizen had a few thousand extra dollars, those that paid debt would bail out the banks, and those that went shopping would bail out retail and manufacturing.

Increasing Supply when there is no Demand just creates a glut, so corporations that get big tax cuts, subsidies, and bailouts don't invest the money in the real economy. They create and pop market bubbles, fleecing small investors, and making financing impossible for small businesses and farms.

Put NEW money in the hands of every citizen (who are ALL consumers) and they will clear inventories, which requires investment to grow to meet demand, which makes investing in the real economy profitable.

'Printing' new money from Our Treasury and giving equal amounts, directly to Citizens would not create inflation right now, because there is giant hole in our economy (of many trillions of dollars).

GIVE OUR MONEY TO US to GROW DEMAND!"
2020-05-19 15:30:24,Mnuchin was asked how many people should die to boost economy. My question how many people should die for staying hungry waiting for a vaccine or getting to a stage where everybody gets tested everyday(liberal dreams).

2020-05-19 15:55:32,The 'permanent damage' that Mnuchin refers to pales in comparison to the severe damage that this administration has already inflicted on the American soul and psyche. The Trump regime has been an unmitigated disaster in myriad ways. It will take generations to recover from the evil done by the Trump crime syndicate. We were warned.
2020-05-19 13:11:09,"And Trump's corruption and obsession with the rich of Wall Street continues.  As for Wal Mart's soaring profits, I am still puzzled.   Their inventory comes mostly from China so I suppose this rhetoric between China and Trump is just rhetoric, nothing more.  Apparently the big cargo ships are still docking at our ports.  Xi of China holds alot of Trump's personal debt apparently so perhaps too much of this malarkey is personal.  So much of Walmart's online goods are from second sellers and my experience is that everything you click on says ""Not available "".  Well, we are starting to see the profiteering from a tragedy."
2020-05-19 14:06:39,"I am sure the gun-toting fanatics of Trump will absolutely support Trump childish behavior re the WHO and other similar organizations (including NATO). But I am also sure that those intelligent Republicans that are out there will agree that attacking, deprecating, threatening, and not funding the very same organizations that our country worked so hard to create after the end of WWII (instead of assuming a prevalent leadership role in those same organizations) is, at least, counterproductive and represents an admission that our country can not longer lead the free world and is renouncing to the role vested onto our country by all our allies after the end of WWII. Shame on those that look the other way at the infantile behavior of Trump."
2020-05-19 15:34:12,"Yes, Secretary Steve, and there will be permanent damage to the deceased who had returned to an infected workplace solely to make yours and Trump's insane economic policies a reality."

But, I'm afraid that everything is justified in their minds, as long as the end result is some type of socialism. I can hear the argument: minimum guaranteed income. 
Why can't you just be honest and admit that this is all you care about, in the end?"
2020-05-19 15:20:11,What in the world does “permanent damage to the economy” even mean?

It's been misstep after misstep with this administration of incompetents since January 2020. The litany of failings is endless. 

Now we hear the constant drumbeat of business over people again and again. Had this pandemic been prepared for and dealt with strategically and intelligently from January on, then the cost to both people and business would have been mitigated."
2020-05-19 15:42:17,May Trump should have taken the virus seriously for 2-3 months sooner than he did.  Maybe his team could put together a national testing strategy.  Maybe his team could be leading the opening instead of the piecemeal approach taken by the states in lieu of no Federal leadership.  Trump has blood on his hands - no one else.  This is his baby.  He owns it.  He botched it.  It is because of his gross lack of leadership and failure to act that we have almost 100K deaths and a likely depression.

With more than 90,000 fatalities, it also has the world's highest death toll.  Who's fault is that?  Trump and his administration's fault.  They still have no plan and more Americans are going to die needlessly as businesses are going to fold.  November 3rd cannot come quick enough."
2020-05-19 16:03:00,"The economy will suffer permanent permanent damage? Wasn't it the Republicans who told us that supply and demand were the natural mechanism of the human race?  If the Republicans believed in their own propaganda they could relax knowing that the economy would rebound naturally on its own.  
   
Instead we must all go back to work and movies in the theaters and dancing and watching sports in huge stadiums.  Of course, millions will die if we do so, but we must give our lives to save the captains of industry's billions of dollars. 

Apparently the captains of industry have found a way to get employees to risk their lives to save the destruction of the way they make their billions at the expense of the people who earn it for them.  

According to F.D. Roosevelt, ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself.""  And now the Republicans are stoking the fires of fear.  And they appear to have failed to consider the problems that come when workers die like flies."
2020-05-19 16:04:12,The economy will be much worse off if nobody in the workforce is left to staff the businesses.  We have got this far with many sad losses. A little more patience will be more beneficial to the economy in the long run. Viruses have a reputation for returning with more deadly virulence if not eliminated the first time
2020-05-19 16:07:58,"You can tell restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, and sports venues and other places to open all you like but as long as they cannot prove that they are safe people will simply not go there. To prove they are safe testing needs to scale even more than what it is now. Personally, I might go to a restaurant only if the owners are able to put a big sign on the door with testing results done in the last two days for all their employees. In addition to social distancing inside the restaurant and masks for the employees. If they just bring testing to those levels to increase public confidence then we will have a better recovery. If they open in these conditions, it won't be safe and there will be no real recovery."
2020-05-19 16:08:09,"Listening to Mr. Mnuchin today, he said that workers are comfortable receiving unemployment benefits, which acts as a disincentive to their returning to work.  That is typical Republican talk about working people.  He went on to say that those who refuse to go back to work (as the Republicans prematurely and irresponsibly seek to open the economy) will lose their unemployment benefits.  He assumes that a reluctance to go back to work arises from the workers being comfortable on the dole, rather than a concern for their, and their families, health and well-being. See, for e.g., meatpacking plant workers who the President told to go back to work, or lose their unemployment insurance. I think he slanders American workers with his comments."
2020-05-19 16:08:13,"“There is the risk of permanent damage,” Mr. Mnuchin told members of the Senate Banking Committee.

2020-05-19 16:08:29,"I think there is a greater likelihood of permanent damage if we're dead.

Of course, if certain Administration figures were dead, we might be able to improve our responses and avert permanent damage."
2020-05-19 16:09:27,"I agree with those who assert that what is happening now is not sustainable.   We must resume.  To do it safely is the challenge especially when no way will be completely safe.  Any way it is done will entail risk of illness and death also.  Naturally, there will be unfairness.  Life is about unfairness.  We've never abolished it.  Those, luckier, will continue to work remotely, maintaining most of their job skills and prior income.  Those, not so lucky, have jobs that can't be done from home online and will face greater risk. We must humanely make their risk as low as can be done and also compensate them in regard to the higher risk they take.  In particular, we must maintain as much as possible, the dreams of our young people, to allow them pursue what they  would ordinarily do.  To do all this will require that we care more about each other, about those who we wouldn't usually think about. We must become more a society that asks and cares, as we have suddenly started to do, ""how are you doing?"""
2020-05-19 16:09:44,"Perhaps Mnuchin should be a little more forceful in the effort of testing and contact tracing being widely available.

We are on the verge of undoing everything that the quarantine was supposed to accomplish."
2020-05-19 16:10:32,"There is a different perception of risks between liberals and conservatives, Texas Republican Dan Crenshaw writes today in another newspaper. That may be true, but there are facts that one cannot ignore, whether one is a liberal or a conservative. Hopefully, also when one is a socialist. Two basic facts are that the US economy is largely dependent upon consumer spending, and that small businesses employ more people than big business. A third fact is that small businesses are the least likely to survive a long lockdown. Ergo, if we wait longer to re-open, many small businesses will not, and they will be out of business. Period. Later, when one feels ready to re-open, the American economy will be gone, and a long-term readjustment will take place. Or, socialism. So, it is necessary to take risks and re-open to save what is now left of the economy. An infrastructure bill will not affect this at all. Now, will more cases occur? Yes, of course. Will more deaths? Yes, but we don't know how many. We only know who - the elderly. Many younger people are willing to risk contracting the virus, according to a Stanford scientist, because they most likely will not die. It doesn't kill that many younger people. And, this might actually reduce the danger from the virus, except for the elderly. Thus, when we re-open we must protect the elderly, most of whom do NOT live in senior nursing homes. And, most people will not die even while they contract the virus. Am I liberal, or conservative?"
2020-05-19 16:10:35,"Three states in the vanguard of reopening: Texas, Florida, and Georgia.  Both the number of new cases and deaths are flat to down over the past month (with the exception of rising cases in Texas, but this is due to a big increase in testing).  This bodes well as the rest of America reopens – and it's good news for the stock market"
2020-05-19 16:12:55,"Mnuchin warns of a ""permanent damage"" to the economy if lock down were to continue ??  I think not only our economy, but also the global economy  and global health will be permanently damaged, if we allow this madness of a regime to continue  for another term this November.

What seems lacking is a coherent and consitent and safe federal systematic guideline on an effective step by step protocol to incrementally lessen the restrictions as the virus threat diminishes.  Unfortuantely, the restrictions, to some people seem Draconian or unneeded, and of course the ""my body"", ""constitution"", gun wielding fanatics won't go along, but for any plans to work, they need to be enforced by local police on a consistent basis.  Not my choice, but if begin to step by step lessen restrictions while still using safe distancing, masks, etc. rather than abolishing the safety measures, then the issue would not be so contentious."
2020-05-19 16:14:10,"The problem in the coddled societies of today, and the US is right up there, is the vast majority of citizens have no idea what's all involved in our finely turned global production machine.  Of course politicians, as well as the media, don't contribute to the solution.

We're not going to have a V shaped recovery.  Things are not going to return to normal.

To begin with, irrespective of government regulations, people will do what THEY feel safe doing.  Lacking any meaningful medical intervention and/or medical prevention (vaccine) large parts of the population won't be going out much.  A big part of that is over 40% of the population suffers from one or more chronic illnesses.  Between that and age it's common knowledge that will put you at the front of the line for the grim reaper called COVID-19.

Beyond that, it'll take a lot of time to get the production and distribution machines all running in sync.  I can go into any open store and see plenty of shelf space gaps.  And none of them have anything to do with toilette paper and hand sanitizer.

Many sectors of the economy will effectively die. Or at least go into long term hibernation or with reduced to negligible activities.

Tourism - 1.6 trillion a year
Retail dining - 800 billion
Automotive - 500 billion
the list goes on.

And behind all of those dollars are working people."
2020-05-19 16:15:03,"Repeal tax cuts and bring back fair tax rates for the wealthy. Stop all corporate welfare. Cut military/weapons spending. We could survive for years on the money saved. 

And all those businesses that have always needed our tax dollars to help them survive can close down. 

We can have a Green New Deal employment program based on renewable energy, infrastructure overhaul, and environmental restoration.

It’s not rocket science."
2020-05-19 16:15:17,"We don't get to pick the timing of when things will return to normal. It doesn't matter what Trump claims. When the virus deaths spike again, we'll be back to square one.  There are some things that are beyond our control.  This is one of them.  As for the economy, welcome to 1929.  It's obvious that's where Trump was leading us even without the virus.  The economy will eventually rebuild itself, just as it always has.  The only question will be how much suffering will we have to endure to get there.  With the GOP in charge, the billionaires will thrive while the USA turns into a banana republic."
2020-05-19 16:15:27,"Mr. Mnuchin's warnings should come with advice to how to personally benefit from the crisis.  I'm sure he has a personal roadmap for how to come out ahead, in much the same way he benefited from the 2008 recession and housing foreclosure crisis."
2020-05-19 16:15:34,"*Mr. Mnuchin said “it is so important to begin bringing people back to work in a safe way.”* I wonder what this admin considers 'safe,' because they complained that the CDC's original recommendations were too prescriptive and McConnell wants no business held liable for unsafe conditions.

They can open up all they want, but no one can make us go out and spend. Jerome Powell is facing facts."
2020-05-19 16:16:29,"We can get through this.
If another outbreak follows with the same impact - it's game over. 
Except for the environment which will, due to lower emissions, start to heal. 
Many lessons to learn in 2020.
Best not to ignore any of them."
2020-05-19 16:17:16,"There is a very difficult cost benefit analysis balancing act here, to be sure. But if the Trump administration would stop trying to shift blame and get on with the work that needs to be done: helping the states with enough testing supplies and enough funding for contact tracing, we could lessen a risk that will always be present in such situations. But then, Donald Trump and his henchmen are far more concerned with themselves than with the welfare of the American people."

I'll bet the hedge funds and investment banks that bought up huge tracts of foreclosed housing after the last recession that they caused don't want to see any of that. Do you know anyone who runs one of those companies, Steve?"
2020-05-19 16:17:46,"The virus will have lasting impact for sure. It will change the consumer spending habits, and allow them to ""reevaluate"" what is essential to living a happy and fulfilling life. That life will probably, out of necessity be less materially oriented. That couch will last another 5 years. The desk top computer you bought on credit,  3 years ago and just paid off?  No need to replace it with a glitzy new one just to match you living room decor and Zoom with your friends. We are already seeing it. But, having it become permanent will take time. People resist change. That's why some will wear masks and others will come up every excuse in the book not to. Some will venture out, willing to Die for Donald, indifferent to risk, and others will stay hunkered down, waiting for the data and science to come in. In the meantime we will see oscillations in the current economy.  These clowns who represent Trump have one message, designed to get their boy reelected, that's gloom and doom if the economy doesn't get back to where it was. The bodies continue to pile up however and that's the best warning for everyone. We are a mere 10 weeks into this thing. We will have more data in the next 10 and then the next. Patience and risk mitigation are required now in combination with protecting the most important part of our national infrastructure: our essential workers."

I will not be dining out, going to the movies, going to a game, shopping brick and mortar for fun, etc. for quite a long time. These are things I previously spent tens of thousands of dollars on every year. It's a consumer behavior thing, not a legal  prohibition thing. I've realized our leaders are liars, or at best incompetent, self-dealing bozos, and their only plan is to let the bodies fall where they may. I've also realized how much less I can happily do with.

2020-05-19 15:48:08,"Take this with a one-ton grain of salt. These are the same former republicans who happily, gleefully denied stimulus in 2008, cuz Mitch burbled his intention to make Obama a one-term president. 

They hated on Democratic economic offers then, and they hate on Democratic economic offers now. They lie in service to the 0.01%, which they have rigged to include them in perpetuity. 

There is no good intent in this administration. Truth is whatever trump declares it for the day. They have offered white supremacy at a time when America is getting less white, and certain elements rushed to embrace it. But it comes with trump's ""I'm gonna need a favor, though. I'm gonna need to be prez for life."" Still they embrace it. 

It's so ugly, so racist and bigoted. So paternalistic and so divisive, that they have to revise all of history so now they even sneer at ""Lincoln's minions"" who victimized the good honest South. I'm not kidding. 

The Saudi guy who gunned down American servicemen in Texas turns out to have ties to ISIS. Both Democrats and trumpublicans will agree that's a bad motive.

The next 'poor frustrated' fascist who guns down moms in a Texas Walmart, who left a trump supporting manifesto with ties to Daily Stormer? Democrats will say that's a bad motive, and trumpies will blame gays, Nancy Pelosi,liberals.. anyone but fascists.

Sure, if you're unemployed for months or years because you don't have any skills, then you may have problems working your whole life, but this is very different from the situation that most workers find themselves in:  they will not forget how to work by staying home for six months.  This line is a smokescreen for the fact that the Republicans don't like it that people are getting unemployment insurance.  They don't want the federal government to give money to states.  It's that same old Republican reluctance to ever help anybody, for any reason, because it might cause rich people's taxes to go up slightly."

2020-05-19 16:19:04,"This will tell you all you really need to know: Congress voted to allow themselves to stay home, while the Trump administration took that choice away from workers in meat processing plants. And nobody cares.

No one has even attempted to justify this blatant exercise of power and privilege. There isn't any reason to think Congress could not meet safely, without incurring even a fraction of the risk the average grocery store clerk faces every day right now. Congress continued to meet, in person, during the Civil War, during the Spanish flu pandemic, during WWI and WWII, the Depression. But this time, they're saying the risk is just too great.

Meanwhile, they're saying that the fate of economy rests on workers in low-paying jobs such as meat packing plants to keep risking their lives every day. So much so that they're taking the choice away from them: the plants are under a federal order to stay open, workers who refuse to show up are denied unemployment benefits, and if they feel that's unfair, a presidential order prevents them from taking legal action against their employer.

Want to know what's wrong with this country? Why, despite all our riches and technology, we're unable to address this crisis any better than some of the third world kleptocracies? This is all you need to know."

Why have republicans in Congress and MitchMcConnell refused to pass the Coronavirus relief package for taxpayers?

If you want to save the economy, you help the machinery (average taxpayers who buy goods and services) that keeps the economy humming — not corporations that are already flush with cash and will use bailouts for CEO bonuses instead of hiring.

2020-05-19 16:23:01,"Permanent Damage? So Trump will refuse to spend enough Federal money to help people and business? The primary reasons that the great recession lasted so long was because 1) the Repubs obstructed the funds necessary to bring it back quickly and 2) they insisted on ""means testing"" to try to block ""undeserving"" people from getting any Federal money. In other words, they blocked money for bailing out home owners who could not pay back their loans, but were showering money on their Wall Street cronies. 

What needs to happen is for the Federal government  to provide enough money to 1) pay the salaries of all people laid off, 2) backstop business loans and losses for small businesses, 3) provide health care for all, 4) backstop all municipal and state budgets.

This is no-brainer stuff. Unfortunately we have sociopaths running the Government. As long as they keep their personal bank accounts topped up they will be happy and they really could not care less about anyone else."

2020-05-19 16:24:31,"Mnuchin's real line - ""The rich may suffer permanent damage to their out of control fortunes unless we open up right away.""

The rest of us are always hurt, so that's not a consideration for them (I believe the phrase ""just the cost of doing business"" often comes to mind), but during this crisis, for the first time (and that includes the Great Depression), the richest are losing money at the same rate as the rest of us, and they're having an existential crisis."
2020-05-19 16:25:05,"The economy we had before this pandemic was a mile wide and an inch deep. The jobs created since the 2008-9 bust were low-paying service jobs. Employment increased but the middle class continued to shrink and wages were stagnant. 
This made the economy fragile and susceptible to the impact of the pandemic. Many of the jobs lost are in service, tourist and luxury fields. They are the first things that consumers delete from their budgets when times get bad. Likewise the employees cut are the first option for employers seeking to cut costs.
Lockdowns didn't create this weakness, they simply reveal it for all to see. Nor will they create ""permanent damage"".  The inherent lack of a robust and balanced economy is the permanent weakness.
 When this pandemic passes we need to rebuild an economy that produces internally and securely all we need from a national security standpoint and one that has a robust manufacturing base with good-paying jobs. 
Our economy has been an illusion of prosperity. We need to build a real and substantial economy, balanced, technologically advanced and one that is a font of creativity and opportunity."

(Don't take my quotes as literal, when they are my recollection of what she was asking.)

Senator Elizabeth Warren grilled Mnuchin on the question of whether he will require that companies that get money from that slush fund keep paying workers.  Mnuchin tried to duck the question, and when she persisted (something she is very good at), he would not make any commitment.

She told him he had not answered the simple question whether he is going to require that they keep people in the payroll, and he tried to duck again.

So Sen. Warren said ""I take that as a NO.""

Mnuchin describes ""the economy"" as if it's a person or creature that can be harmed and so we should feel worried and protective of it. No. It is neither accurate nor productive to personify the economy, using words that tug on heart strings so citizens feel like our shared mission is to be caregivers to the economy. The economy is nothing more than a whole bunch of human exchanges and transactions considered together. Economic growth is nothing more than human beings productively expending their energy, in a way that's a bit more efficient than it was before. No doubt, structural changes are occuring in the economy of the US and that of the whole world due to the pandemic.

So once again the states are leading the way while Trump and his cronies are trying to take the credit.And lastly Steve,it was social distancing and masks that enabled the states to begin reopening their economies with little or no help from your president.Remember Steve that while California and Washington state were promoting sheltering in place in late February,your boss was telling us;""and again,when you have 15 people,and the 15 within a couple of days,is going to be down to zero..that's a pretty good job we're doing"".Now you're prodding the states to reopen their economies,If you 'd acknowledged the problem back in February, we probably wouldn't have had the devastation we've seen in the first place.I guess you guys have no shame...and short memories.And yes...this is something we should be talking about now."

2020-05-19 16:23:58,"""Build it and they will come""

Um, nope, not gonna happen. Eighty-one percent of the U.S. population thinks the federal government is pushing states to re-open too soon. Sixty-seven percent of the annual GDP is consumer spending. 

What these ""experts"" don't seem to understand is you can re-open all the stores and bars and nightclubs and water parks you want, but until the American people have some feeling of you know, that old ""consumer confidence"" the U.S. economy will sputter along, anemic and sick, like all those people in the hospitals. 

And the fact that this administration not only STILL has no plan for America and a road to safety and confidence, the trump administration is actively gaslighting the American public day after day.

Just go look at the chart that Georgia put out to justify it's re-opening, which showed a nice, stead decline. But upon closer inspection, it was found the state chart had put May 2 ahead of April 27 and other chicanery. 

The U.S. is less than 5 percent of the world's population, and yet we have over 33 percent of the reported infections. What a travesty."

The economy will remain broken and the permanent damage along with the death total will much greater than if the return to work is done cautiously and carefully utilizing CDC guidelines and extensive testing and contact tracing. I believe it is much too early to return to work at this time.

In the case of Mnuchin, I am skeptical of anything he says.Every reasonable expert, no matter their political leanings, argues that there isn't -- nor should there be -- a conflict between maintaining safe health protocols while also renewing economic activity.  But Mnuchin, like his mentor in the Oval Office, persists in asserting the doomsday scenario that essentially argues that the continued loss of life from the virus is a small price to pay if people can't work or go out to eat or head to the mall.

Seemingly the only large-scale group of people who subscribe to this argument includes Trump's base, his enablers in the Republican Party, red state governors, and Trump's careless footmen in his increasingly panicked Administration."

The economy was seriously damaged by the trump's administration not being prepared, lying about the severity and refusing to take any meaningful action for MONTHS. Thousands more people died. Look at countries who took decisive action and who had functioning healthCARE systems instead of health insurance systems. They are ready to go either way. More containment or reviving their economies. The US is a mess because of trump."

It is disheartening, and downright  disgusting to witness what was once the greatest country in the world on its knees, wrestling with itself to the death while its elected leader - who has abdicated all responsibility for  and action against the virus plays mind games with his loyal followers.

This is either ignorance or a deliberate crime. I have lived in both red and blue America and though life opportunities may be restricted by postal code America may be crazy it isn't ignorant.
The overtly obvious anomalies of cases and deaths in places like Florida, Texas, Arkansas and Georgia makes understanding covid19's nationally a matter of political opinion instead of fact based issues of economy and public health.
In a real democracy the government is responsible for informing the people it represents of the facts.

2020-05-19 16:39:57,"""Mnuchin Warns of ‘Permanent Damage’ to Economy if Lockdowns Persist."" 

This is undoubtedly true, and in fact there has very likely already been permanent damage to the world economy, with great consequences, including widespread hunger and starvation.

Further, data shows that the lockdowns have flattened the curve, but they haven't eliminated the virus; only a vaccine can do that.  The virus returns as the lockdowns are slowly lifted.

There's a tradeoff, and our leadership needs to decide how quickly and to what extent to lift the lockdowns.  The important thing to remember is that we need to look at the whole picture. Continuing lockdowns in full force indefinitely, or at least until there's a vaccine, is probably not the correct response."
2020-05-19 16:41:30,"Permanent economic damage to the vast majority of Americans started in 1980 with the election of Ronald Regan. It has increased steadily through every successive administration. The effort has been to push the money upwards toward a few politically advantage individuals and corporations and has simply reach it's highest point yet under the current administration. The fall out from the virus will be used to bankrupt as many small and mid sized businesses as possible so that a few larger organizations that will be guaranteed existence by the governments distribution of tax payer monies to them, along with courts who rule only in their favor, will be able to buy numerous entities for pennies on the dollar and thus allows them to consolidate further control over all aspects of business and government.  Then the people who are still alive will have no choice but to work for these few organizations at poverty wages or perish due to their leftist and anti-capitalist points of view. The sadist with machine guns will act as fields overseers and shoot anyone who dares to question question the authority of the great overlords. 

Okay, maybe not quite, but most people will remain fairly well brainwashed and consider it important that they have powerful and cruel overlords of some type. Serfs will be serfs and American are clearly serfs."

Millions more private sector employees who were part time have received nothing. In my neighborhood just a few doors down a man blew his brains out leaving a wife and two young daughters. He was sent home by his employer and just learned that his employer would not reopen because his business is now lost forever. Public employees do not face this reality.

People engage economically where it feels safe to do so. In the absence of an effective treatment for the coronavirus, a generally available vaccine, and trusted national leadership, economic activity — outside of on-line purchases — will be in fits and starts for the simple reason that millions of people will not feel safe going out either to work or spend.

As long as people are afraid of catching this disease they aren't going to spend as much money as they did before and without that spending the economy craters.

Fer sure.  My father graduated from college right into the Great Depression in 1933.  He told me stories about how that affected him.  Here is one short one:

He went looking for a job.

The man who interviewed him for one job asked ""How many people are in your family?""
My dad answered: ""Five, my father, three sisters, and me."" (His mother died in an accident when he was 8.)
The man asked: ""How many have jobs?""
My dad answered: ""Two, my father and one sister.""
The man said: ""You are going to eat.  I need to give this job to somebody with five people in their family, none of whom have jobs.""

End of that interview. 

Wanna bet that conversation gets repeated if this economic situation is anything like the 1930s Depression with 25% unemployment?  (But maybe not right away.  It will take time before the pain and suffering are felt widely enough for such questions to enter the minds of people doing the hiring.)"

In addition to the economic damage, the lockdown is resulting in untold mental damage, impairing the education of the next generation, etc.

Hospitals and testing labs are laying off since ""elective"" procedures are halted.  This will lead to a rise in ailments that could have been prevented, such as measels, cancer, chronic pain, heart disease, etc.  It will also impair our ability to handle coronavirus.
1 in 5 children don't have enough food - double what it was before.
Homelessness is projected to increase by 50%.
Sharp increases in domestic violence, mental health problems, drug and alcohol abuse.
Speculation, but we are likely to see a sharp uptick in crime in the coming years.  Remember when NYC was seeing 2,000 murders a year?  We could be in for that again.
State and local governments will be forced to make deep budget cuts and raise taxes, regardless of what relief Congress provides.
$3 trillion+ added to the national debt with nothing to show for it (you can kiss Medicare for all goodbye).
Millions of people close to retirement suddenly lost their livelihood.
Even more millions of young people entering the job market will now be permanently set back in their careers and will be much more poor for the remainder of their lives.

1. A healthcare system (private or public) for everyone and guaranteed forever by the government. We will pay for it though our taxes, of course, but there should be requirements that EVERYONE pays in and not just the little guys.
2. A wage and pension program that covers everything from job loss, layoffs, vacations, pensions, etc. Guaranteed by the government. Social Security must be universal and guaranteed as well.

As a data scientist myself, I’m disgusted by the behavior of some officials with regard to presentation of data. The thing about a scientist is that we don’t give a bloated toad’s fat speckled hindparts what you want the data to say. It’s going to say what it says. And if you ask a scientist to “make it look better,” most will not do this. I certainly won’t. You will have to find someone who lacks integrity, and when you do that, you lower the quality of the position because most scientists will not manipulate the data because it goes against everything science stands for. 

Mnuchin needs to make sure every state is presenting the data honestly before he laments the economy. Florida isn’t, and Georgia isn’t either. Two purplish state hmmm what do ya know?

However, many people will not go out of their homes for anything but essential business, until they feel sure that it doesn't come with a risk of substantial suffering or even death.  So the only way to ""reopen"" the economy is to get the epidemic under control.  Unfortunately the ""militant individualists"" are not ready to make the kind of sacrifices that will bring infections down low enough to get the ""timid concerned"" out of their homes.

By pretending the virus did not exist, was a Democratic hoax; by previously eliminating a pandemic response team; by reducing the CDC’s budget, then attempting to politicize all scientific and medical announcements; by doing nothing, and worse, appropriating what PPE or lifesaving equipment states mamage to purchase. By stirring dissent against stay-at-home Democratic governors (even while warning Republican states not to take unnecessary risks)

The Trump people seem to view the world as a child's board game, where the goal is to get all the money, and make sure no one else has any before the game ends.  What they fail to grasp is that the economy is complex and self-supporting: if you want a healthy economy (as opposed to a ""good quarter"") you need to let the little people have some wealth as well. The stock market is only a small part of the story.

They say the same about tens of thousands of excess deaths due to gun suicides and homicides every single year (the price of freedom), about even more preventable deaths due to inadequate health services, food, housing, sanitation, etc. It's a pretty common pattern for conservatives. 

Sadly, many otherwise okay citizens seem to have bought into it. Reagan's reductive and destructive notion that ""government isn't the solution to your problems, government IS the problem"" wasn't just a slogan, it was a game plan.

This eventually happened but not before delays and being means tested at the insistence of Democrats.  Further calls for such payments were made by other Republicans, providing ample opportunity for proverbial working across the isle.  Democrats instead insisted on a clunky unemployment insurance enhancement.  With Democrats consistently opposing stimulus from the right, it is no surprise that Mnuchin should revert to his true nature and tell the country to quit bellyaching and get out there and hustle."

Even if stores and restaurants open today - not everyone will go out. Will enough people go out to make a difference or a profit? Or will they save their money because of the uncertainty? Or fear of the getting sick and dying? 

Since the federal response has been so bad, so misguided, and so corrupt - it will take even longer to deal with the problem as a whole. Which is still not being handled.

2020-05-19 17:39:45,It's a false choice--shutdown or economy. Economy will not recover without the underlying problem brought under control. The key is to ramp up testing as some states have done by now to make sure anyone who needs a test gets one with results available promptly so that he/she does not unknowingly keep infecting others. This way you can keep infection under control even as you open the economy without creating conditions for a huge resurgence which will take us back to square one.

Instead Trump was effusively praising President Xi Jinpeng for handling Coronavirus even 10 days after WHO had published the Testing Kit it had developed in Germany on 16th Jan !! Why US Media, including The NYT, has miserably Failed to hold Donald Trump Directly Accountable for 92,471 American deaths - the highest in the World - inspite of getting over 60 days to produce ample Testing Kits, Masks, PPEs, Medications & implement Contact Tracing to prevent all deaths. China did not get even 1 day to prepare its resources & yet it limited deaths to 4200 with a population of 1400 millions.

Instead there could and should have been fully supplied, certified and operating testing facilities already in place and functioning, the whole virus catastrophe effectively contained, and conceivably even avoided.

His comments are meant to instill fear into Trump's base - die from hunger versus die from COVID-19.

How many small businesses have been shut out of getting assistance by banks in favor of their wealthier, bigger clients? 

These have caused, and will continue to cause, massive harm to the majority of Americans, and since our economy is driven by consumers, that will reverberate throughout the system. But at least Trump and all the wealthy people are safe.

Meanwhile, McConnell tells the states to declare bankruptcy to ease their financial burden. Maybe all Americans should do that. How protected would Wall St. and the rapacious banks be then?

Yesterday he mentioned and went to his news conference he was taking medication for the coronavirus 19 let me point out were at 15,000 lies already this will be one more to add to his list of phony a liar cheat that's what we have for president. Only people are going to get this country back on the road to recovery will be the Democrats that's history and matter approve not fake news like the president touts."

Assuming our economy creates on average 250,000 new jobs per month -- which is going to be pretty hard to do in the middle of another great recession -- it will take about 160 months -- or about 13 years -- to return us to pre-Coronavirus employment levels.  

Let's just pretend that we somehow find the political will to create something like a 21st Century version of the W.P.A., which created something like 1,000,000 new jobs in one single month back in 1936 at the height of the Great Depression....

In my lifetime, the good governments of the U.S. have tended to be Democrat-led.

From what I've experienced, the Republican-led governments have favored the rich and the corporations, and have consolidated power and wealth with the few.  They have eroded education, health care, and a social safety net.  They have eroded voting rights of the disadvantaged.  Forget about the environment, forget about science.  Forget about integrity.

Sure, evangelicals helped put Trump over the top in 2016.  They now have a solid extreme conservative majority on the USSC and they continue building the Federal Courts System. 

But if we continue on this current path of scorched earth conservative xenophobic trumpism in the Federal Government, there won't be much democracy left in the U.S.

Seems a relatively small group of Americans, brainwashed by faux-fox propaganda, and hateful extremist conservative radio toxic dribble, have succeeded in driving a hateful wedge, that unbeknownst to them, is undermining their future.

It can be done, and China is showing how -- testing, contact tracing, quarantining when needed, mask-wearing, social distancing, cooperation by the populace and enforcement by the government.

And, of course, as scientists are working on therapeutics that can moderate symptoms or even eliminate the disease even before vaccines are found and produced, and as doctors are learning techniques for managing care for the sick, every week we delay opening is a week when the scientists' and doctors' work gets further along towards success.

So, please Sec Mnuchin, stop just saying we have to get back to work. We know that. What is your plan for doing it right? Or are we being driven by those shouting at state houses brandishing weapons and ignorant of how they could be endangering others and themselves for no good reason?"

If we had been properly warned about the economic consequences in a clear way we might have been reluctant to give the public health officials, who seemed unconcerned about the economy  a free hand. We might have been committed to a more limited government and more economic freedom. If so we could have avoided some of the damage of which they spoke. Arguably we would have been better off ."

But common sense and experience tell us that Facebook contributes significantly toward concentrating sales in the hands of bigger businesses--not smaller ones. The book Winner Takes All goes into this. This is a feature--not a bug. An excellent case in point is the newspaper industry, in which Facebook has scarfed up so much advertising that the smaller players can scarcely survive--if at all. 

Even if you think Facebook can help small business, rather than hinder it, you should question Facebook's motives. After all, they themselves say they want to diminish shoppers' fear of buying on-line. Doesn't that play directly into their hands?

If Facebook really wants to help small business, it will turn off the lights and send everyone home."

It saved my life.  It paid so well that after 5 years I was able to stop working and attend and complete university and graduate school, with $15,000 left over.  In the end, I earned a graduate degree in electrical engineering.  Life has been smooth sailing ever since.

I know very well what it's like to work for minimum wage, and I don't know how even a young, unmarried childless person can survive in this moribund trump economy, let alone someone who has dependents.  Minimum wage means you NEVER have so much as a spare dollar to save.

The country has spent an enormous amount of wealth and Republicans are so fixated upon not using the ability of the federal government to reimburse states and people and small businesses to avoid raising taxes on the most affluent, that it will be a long recovery.

We have 9% not covered at all, due to both 14 red states not having expanded Medicaid, and, as well, often unaffordable premiums, due to such problems as the ""subsidy cliff"" and ""family glitch"" which were in the ACA at the start and not fixed.

Another problem, among the""covered"": In at least 10 states (e.g., MA, MD, NJ, IA, NV, NH, IN, IA, and ID), for people 55 and over, half the ACA coverage-- expanded Medicaid--is not, in fact, insurance at all.  It it subject to estate recovery, making it only a loan until death. 

(People get expanded Medicaid when their income is to 138% of the Fed. Pov. Lvl.)

Peoples' medical bills are paid out for them now, but bills must be paid back by their estates when they die.  To many, it's a financial bomb, and many who have it don't know about it.

This defect was publicized a bit in 2013 /2014, such as in The Washington Post, and the Atlantic, and the Seattle times.

and, some states, like OR, WA, NY, VT, CA, CO, and MN did fix their recovery laws to make at least all ACA coverage real insurance.  But many did not.

(Further, certain states, such as CT and WA, did only a partial correction, making expanded Medicaid not recoverable, but other medical Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are still just a loan.)

They are complementary actions, and unless we do both and soon, civilization as we know will be over. Nazism was to a large extent a child of the Great Depression. Churchill, Roosevelt and Marshall saved civilization that time. Men like them do not exist any longer. It is therefore necessary to force narrow minded health experts to learn some history, economics and sociology. Civilization is more important than individual human lives.

True, the Great Depression and post-World War II wealth bomb gave a false sense of security to the majority of the country's laboring classes (of which I count myself a member).  But since Reagan, that pattern has been reversed.  If you don't get lucky in the stock market or in some Shark Tank-like global corporate scheme, you are in a pickle.  

And how incoherent can the Trump Administration be about what we should do in relationship to COVID-19?  Where I live,  in southern California, everyone is taking the necessary/recommended precautions, but I don't see any real drop in cases or deaths.  Yet, now we're just supposed to open the economy and pretend everything is okay again?  I can only speculate that they are doing this out of desperation, knowledge that all the ""free money"" they have printed will destroy the economy.  

I suspect the next year is not going to be pleasant one, and that we are going to learn a thing about the limitations of liberal democracy.  I don't have a sense that any of our elites know what to do, and as a result many of us are going to be on our own.  Good luck to us."
2020-05-20 02:50:25,"Just in from California: another way lower income people will suffer disproportionately from the COVID crisis.

The issue is Medicaid estate recovery, when applied to the Medicaid that covers ordinary medical expenses, such as ACA expanded Medicaid.

In many states, ACA expanded Medicaid and other non-long-term-care Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are not insurance, even though the Federal and state governments misrepresent them as insurance in their statistics.  (Because they are subject to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily for a person, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.  It's a loan until death for Medical expenses, not insurance, and it impedes lower income people, who disproportionately get ACA expanded Medicaid and other Medicaids, from passing even a little wealth on to their kids.)

The problem only exists in some states at the moment,  though many blue, like MA, NJ, and MD.

Some states corrected the problem, partly or completely, starting in main ACA provision year 2014, by amending their estate recovery policies.  Some states that did this are NY and CA.  (Making at least all ACA coverage real insurance.)

Well, come the COVID crisis, and there is a budget problem in CA, and the new budget proposes to undo the fix, which CA did in 2017.

That’s a change worth noting because it has been adamant since December that the source was the Wuhan market and so it thoroughly cleansed that market, destroying evidence that could be analyzed. It shut down then later reopened 20,000 other wet street markets in China.  Quite a show.

Growing scientific evidence from evolutionary and molecular biologists at Harvard, MIT, the University of British Columbia and the Lancet are certain the virus did not originate in the Wuhan market.  Ruling out the market leaves only one suspected source - the government run virus research labs in Wuhan.  But those two labs have been off limits to international visitors, especially investigators, since the outbreak.  The CCP recently ordered that biosafety and biosecurity be strengthened at all its Virus research labs.  This follows visitors and witnesses who were alarmed by lapses in biosafety practices. In 2004 SARS escaped a Beijing lab twice due to careless grad students interning at the lab.  And a government lab director was convicted of selling infected lab animals to black market bushmeat vendors as a side gig.  

It is most likely that the virus accidentally escaped or was purposely released from a lab.  So no, the virus could not have come from “anywhere”."

He would lie to you about the color of his tie as you are looking at it with your own eyes. And he would do it for no purpose whatsoever. 

For all we know, the US created the virus and released it in China. That is the type of thing Trump would advocate for; biological warfare; especially as a trade negotiation tactic.

Now I'm not saying I trust China. But, unfortunately, I can no longer trust America, nor can any American.

There is reason to criticize Trump’s ineptitude, along with the WHO, but there are degrees of guilt starting with the emergence or onset of the virus in Wuhan, to amplification of it that was avoidable and preventable outside China.

Yes, the Corona crisis is indeed unprecedented within the life of the EU and its earlier forms.  But if the EU does indeed develop a Union-wide financial plan for this situation it will be a template for future such arrangements.

As the world evolves in the post-US empire era, it will be essential for Europe to act in an increasingly coherent policy fashion.  At least in economic terms, Europe will necessarily come to exist as a separate global power center.

What future forms the EU evolves into remains a work in progress.  But entering into a joint debt issuer is a defining moment.

By moving Germany in this direction and once again affirming the special Franco-German relationship the Chancellor, together with President Macron, has given Europe the ability to confront a crisis on a unified rather than divisive basis."
2020-05-18 18:24:48,"Safe and effective, with so far only 8 persons analyzed in any detail? This is a wholly new recombinant genetic technology which I think needs severe oversight.

 Do people realize that they are being injected with RNA, to program their cells to make viral protein(s). How long does that RNA last in the human body, for how long will these vaccine recipients be making foreign proteins ? 

It is not at all the same as injecting with viral proteins, in this Moderna case, your body is getting the viruses genetic code. If you do not want to eat genetically modified foods, then you should not want your body used as for genetic modifications that occur with this vaccine. 

I am all for vaccines, but not with this untested technology that no one knows is safe. It could be a year later that your body develops a cytokine storm from this vaccine, by then most of the US population will likely be carrying foreign viral RNA in their body for the rest of their life. 

Please everyone, educate yourself on what this vaccine really involves, new technology is not automatically safer or better, just newer. You are essentially volunteer guinea pigs for Moderna if you line up for this vaccine. Be careful !"
2020-05-18 18:02:06,"Dear NYT,

I have experience in vaccine design, and your description of this vaccine as ""safe and effective"" is premature, based on the information provided. The test showed that the vaccine alone does not cause adverse effects, and that it elicits antibodies that can neutralize virus in a test-tube. However, to be ""effective"" in the real sense, the vaccine has to shield the vaccinees against infection, which was not reported. Not only do we not know this, we don't know whether the vaccinees would fare better or worse when exposed to virus. For some viruses, the wrong kinds of antibodies can actually enhance disease. I would simply call the Moderna study ""promising""."
2020-05-18 19:16:13,"Trump has made extremely false allegations against WHO, to deflect from his own inept US response to the pandemic:

1.  Trump stated:  ""The WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet & share information in a timely and transparent fashion. .... ""

Facts:  Trump nonsense.  China told WHO of ""a pneumonia of an unknown cause"" on 12/31/19.   On 01/20/20, a regional WHO team visited Wuhan.  On 01/22, WHO issued a detailed statement, confirming clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.  This is 3 weeks from onset.

2.  Trump states:  ""The WHO [is] funded largely by the United States, yet is very China-centric.""

Facts:  False Trump statement.  Until Trump stopped paying, the US provided 15% of the WHO budget.  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation itself provides 9.8%.  Next comes the U.K. at 7.8% & Germany at 5.7%.  The European Commission provides 3.3%.    This is hardly ""largely"", and by no means ""China-centric"".

3.  Trump states: ""One of the most dangerous decisions... from the WHO was... to oppose travel restrictions. They actually fought us.""

Facts:  A complete Trump lie.  Trump restricted travel from China from 02/02/20.  There is no record of the WHO publicly criticizing this move.   It would have been highly unusual for it to do so.

Conclusion: The world currently sis suffering through two pandemics.  One is COVID-19.  The other is Trump's constant lies and misinformation."
2020-05-19 00:54:15,"""Limited data from the early phase, however leaves much uncertainty around the vaccine’s potential success""

Mmmm what data has the science community seen? Forgive my cynicism but this is Trumps boy. A man that stands to gain a lot.

The cyber attack attempting to steal vaccine data suggests they are not sharing information about the various breakthroughs.

I just couldn't possibly trust these men or any vaccine they might develop. I'll wait until the science community around the world has their say thank you.

I will have trouble accepting any vaccine that was made under a year. I'm all for vaccines but not dodgy ones.

I'd like to remind you, several sailors on the Roosevelt have contracted the virus for a second time since returning to the ship. Supporting my belief that herd immunity is a very fallible strategy."

Project Europe has lost quite some plummage during these last years.

Their city provided SUVs and chauffeurs will be excepted, of course.

Hopefully when this is over our city government - and those who seek to run our government next year - will recognize that congestion in NYC (especially Manhattan) isn't caused by the people who live here and pay the massive premium to do so.

Around 20% of Manhattan residents have an automobile. The vast majority of them only use their cars on weekends. 

We can't drive on our sown streets but we can't park on them either. Manhattan streets need to be swept twice a week. In Queens once a week is fine. Astoria only started once a week this year. When there is a spot it's taken by a car from New Jersey, CT, Nassau or Suffolk counties. 

Manhattanites have to pay upwards of $700 a month to park in a garage and are now threatened with ""congestion pricing"" for driving on our own streets. 

Thousands of cars on our streets are registered to parents, aunts and college buddies in the suburbs to avoid NY tax and insurance. Our elected officials are fine with that.

Instead, it practically invites more congestion and hazardous (criminal) conduct, blithely comparing city driving to Grand Theft Auto. (Landmarks only ""flit"" past if you speed.)

The Times has recently reported on the rising death toll from cars and trucks, the growing use of bikes for transportation after the pandemic, the mayor's on-again-off-again plans for open streets. The deaths are mentioned--yet in the singular focus on the aesthetics of driving, it's like they don't matter.

""Driving through the city means always being on high alert, watchful for other cars, bicycles, joggers and roadwork.""  No, it means thousands of injured nondrivers each year, and hundreds of deaths, which are implacably rising. (Interesting that pedestrians were left off your list.)

""It cannot last, of course...But for now, an emptiness remains."" Right. Only cars--not peds, bicyclists, or other humans and animals--count as a presence. (Peds are just things that ""wander or lurch"" in the way of cars.)

I used to laugh with people from the south and west that said wow, the city that never sleeps. I used to say NYC usually pulled in the side walks by midnight in most places. Some bars and fewer restaurants stood open but try to find a place to get pack of cigarettes you'd better plan ahead. Things changed and became the dream. Then Covid-19 hit.

Many large European cities have a good balance of bicycles, cars, and trucks, often with protected bike lanes so the bicyclists can’t get hit by cars and trucks.

Improvements should be made to subways, buses, and trains making them less crowded, more efficient and comfortable so that there is no reason to drive in Manhattan and much of the other boroughs.

Dense living should mean public transportation or bicycles, with cars and trucks ONLY used when there is no other option (for the physically handicapped, limited efficient delivery schedules, etc.)."
2020-05-18 00:46:50,"Okay, Thanks. Can you pleeez document the brutally long and normally crowded pedestrian corridor between the G train and Manhattan bound E train at Court Square. That will be proof positive that speaks to legions of commuters."
2020-05-18 00:58:28,"Ah, I can only dream that it was like this all the time"
2020-05-18 01:24:03,"I’ve ridden my bike all over the city the past 2 months with my 9 year old son.  The feelings I get from the peacefulness, and clear skies, juxtaposed against the horrors this virus has afflicted on the city is hard to put into words.  I hope we can all learn something here."
2020-05-18 01:25:48,Wow. I’ve always done the public transportation thing. Maybe I’ll consider driving in the city now!
2020-05-18 01:20:24,"It's sad that it takes a pandemic to show New Yorkers the benefits of congestion pricing.  Critics always say that it hurts the little guy.  nope, it benefits the little guy.  You save $$$ on not overhauling your brakes every six months.  You save on fuel.  And best of all you can spend more time with the family.  Get with it people."
2020-05-18 01:30:07,"The article is out of date, as traffic has very much returned compared to a month ago.  No traffic jams, mind you, but the lanes are more full.

Nonetheless, it's still a Robert Moses Fantasy version of NYC."
2020-05-18 01:38:22,"The City is quiet, the air is breathable for the first time in generations - and the NYTimes is bragging about how great it is to drive in the City? What an irresponsible article! Just look around: Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Madrid, London, Amsterdam of course - and cities in the US: San Francisco and Oakland. All of these cities have reacted to the Corona Virus with cheap and workable infrastructure changes to encourage walking, biking and social distancing. These are the cities of the future. Because after Corona - if there is an after - we all know what's coming: Climate change, and it's not waiting for us to get out of our cars. As for me, I have the bedroom window open for the first time in the 20 yrs I've lived on my block in Chelsea. Do we really want to go back? I don't."
2020-05-18 01:45:35,"It looks and feels that NY City commerce has died and may never come back.  Closed Stores, Empty Streets,  Closed Hotels like the Hilton on Sixth Avenue.  No Trade slows at the Convention Center,  No More Broadway Shows.  The people have fled the City."
2020-05-18 02:04:41,Not having been stuck in traffic for the last two months is one of the few brights side of recent months.
2020-05-18 02:10:29,"Not mentioned is that bicycle traffic, particularly from delivery people, has become like the Wild West. Bicycles - both regular and motorized - are traveling in all directions on avenues and streets without regard to traffic lights, stop signs, one-way signs, bike lanes, pedestrians, or even oncoming cars. It's insane. Traffic laws need to be enforced against bicycles."
2020-05-18 02:10:42,"Seems like this would be a good time to create some dedicated bus lanes.  Buses barely moved in Manhattan pre-Covid; adding some dedicated bus lanes would allow buses to actually get somewhere, and could take some people off the subway, which will be way too crowded for comfort when things open up again.  Many other cities have gone to dedicated bus lanes because they can create efficient and flexible transit with almost no capital cost."
2020-05-18 02:17:10,"Of course the streets are devoid of New York cars.   I see them all on the roads around Okemo, Stratton, Killington and Mount Snow here in Vermont.

It sounds like a once in a lifetime opportunity to have a New York City equivalent of the Cannonball Run.   Record the lowest possible time to drive from Tottenvillw in Staten Island to the Woodlawn section of the Bronx."
2020-05-18 02:24:17,"This is a great time to just go whole hog and ban private use vehicles, cap livery to 10,000 drivers and create more publicly owned open space (ie remove select streets from vehicle use and allow outdoor cafe tables) within the five boroughs."
2020-05-18 03:02:48,"Personally, I'd love to be able to ride a bike from Westchester to NYC (beautiful views), but not really feasible. Since Clovid-19, I no longer commute via Metro North to Midtown. It is hassle-free working remotely, and I like it. I have driven into the city twice on select Sundays. very early in the morning. The lack of traffic is great, but the lack of any business/entertainment activity is eerie. I don't ever want tourism to return to NYC the way it was, but I miss Broadway shows, certain restaurants, boutique shopping, bookstores, libraries, etc."
2020-05-18 03:10:37,"That's because people have moved out to real country places where they are cluttering up the roads (relatively, of course)."
2020-05-18 03:15:16,"It kills me to read this story. I move out of Queens after 63 years, 37 of which I commuted to downtown Brooklyn by car every day.  Now that I move away, my driving fantasy of a lifetime comes true, and I’m not there to enjoy it."
2020-05-18 03:18:06,"I am more than happy to see the people who are essential workers and who I interact with drive in as opposed to taking transit.   That is in my self interest.  

And while it might be nice to be able to have fewer cars when commercial activity resumes, I’m afraid that the lack of pre-crisis congestion will be the result of a prolonged recession and a fundamental change in the city that will be for the worse.  
Much worse."
2020-05-18 03:28:29,Well it reminds me of traffic shown in movies from the 1950s and 60s. How does it feel to drive without sitting around honking in bumper to bumper?
2020-05-18 03:43:41,"I am tired of hearing things being described as post-apocalyptic. Can't life be experienced in the present and enjoyed? Personally, New York City has never been more beautiful, EVER, than it is to me now. It's a dream come true of living in 17th-century air quality within a contemporary, beautiful city. I like how someone below described the current traffic as to how the city was in the 50s (another perspective). Let's live in the present moment, appreciate what we have. The future will unfold in surprising ways. Wellness is an option."
2020-05-18 03:50:19,"During the Coronavirus pandemic, I have been delivering groceries and prepared meals to a few friends in New York City and the boroughs.  It is clear sailing, a quick back and forth from New Jersey.  I must confess that it will be the one thing I will miss when the people again return to the streets."
2020-05-18 04:08:35,"I was a shop foreman of a large auto repair shop on 72nd St between 1st & 2nd  in the 1980s.   High end cars;  high end customers;  price no object but it better be fixed right the first time.

Given the garbage auto makers were making in the 1980s (domestic and foreign) that was a tall order.

Road testing difficult to isolate complaints as well as the completed product was difficult in East Side traffic.  I would typically go in to the shop around 5AM when the streets were deserted as they are now so I could duplicate the driving conditions to verify complaints and finished repairs.

The perfectly in sync traffic lights were a big help.  
Once, I took a Saab 900 for a test drive to see if it was fixed.  The car performed flawlessly.  I returned to the shop to find the porter in panic.  

I took the wrong Saab for the test drive and the customer of the car I was in showed up to pick it up early.  Trying to quickly come up with an excuse for driving a car I should not have I saw a For Sale sign in the car window.

I told the owner ""Sir, I don't know how much you are asking, but hold firm on price.  This car performs like it is brand new!""

Phew!

Another time I was walking to 1st to buy lunch.   I noticed all the traffic on 1st was going in reverse!

As I turned the corner onto 1st, a bright light shone in my eyes and a voice said ""just look straight ahead sir.""

They were filming the baby carriage scene from a ""Ghostbusters"" movie and the cars were all stunt cars."
2020-05-18 04:34:17,Driving now is like driving in the '60s and '70s. The city was empty. No traffic. Lots of parking spots. I grew up here and the notable thing about pictures from my childhood taken outside in Manhattan is how empty everything was. It's not post-apocalyptic. It's back to the future!
2020-05-18 04:38:56,"Beautiful video. The centrality of the car is one of the big differences between the city and the suburbs. No one moves to New York City for the parking. I hope there’s a sequel to this article showing the recent explosion of bike traffic and imagining how the city could transform around it, including using cycling as a driver for tourism to return. The idea that most of the city will still have a job to commute to is nostalgic at this point. It’s time to get creative."
2020-05-18 06:11:50,"I've been a very responsible shelterer-in-place but I'm an avid motorcycle rider and it's been hard to resist the empty streets of Manhattan combined with Spring weather. I recently rode from West 46th St. to West 87th St. without stopping a single time. And minutes prior to that, from W 14th without a stop to W 46th. Once in a lifetime silver lining."
2020-05-18 06:13:42,Yesterday evening I drove 300km on motorways in France...there was hardly a car in site until arriving home in Paris. I have never been so happy to be in a Sunday evening traffic jam.
2020-05-18 07:29:16,"I work on an essential construction site on the UWS and drive into the city 45 miles each way because I am afraid to take the express bus and subway. It's very expensive to drive in between the tolls, gasoline for a small 14 year old car and parking in the city altogether costs nearly $1,000 per month. But I don't feel safe on the public transit right now. Thankfully the traffic is very light right now, there are hardly any ubers or cabs now. I do save some money by leaving a half hour later in the morning and eating breakfast at home before I leave for work at 5 am. I get home about 5 pm due to a slightly shorter workday. The cost of driving in doesn't include extra wear and tear on the car, tires and oil changes, car washes, special disinfectant for the inside of the car because there are no self park lots, etc."
2020-05-18 09:35:57,"I've gotten out for a walk every day since the lockdown started and can tell you traffic is picking up.  One example, I used to be able to cross the West Side Highway without waiting for the walk sign. The absence of traffic is one of the very few bright spots from this epidemic.  I'm hoping city leaders (in whom I have little faith) will rethink traffic patterns and take some actions to limit traffic in the future. Then again, once the lockdown ends, workers might resolve this issue as many will likely remain home."
2020-05-18 10:08:44,"I think in a way this is doing the pandemic a disservice. Yes we understand how things are eery and driving down 5th avenue with no buses or cabs is unreal, but I don't think this is in line with a keep calm carry on mentality. It's just reality right now, until it's not, and then it won't be. Are you going to report how great the traffic is again? Just stick to the news."
2020-05-18 10:12:19,"I noticed traffic picking up slightly and decided to do something I've been fantasizing about for years. I hopped on my bike early Sunday morning and rode up to Broadway Bridge at the northern tip of Manhattan from Clinton Hill, then rode the entire length of Broadway in Manhattan to Battery Park. 

There isnt even a bike lane North of of 59th street and the road is worn with years of heavy traffic. I only had to stop a handful of times and was able to take a full lane south of 181st. It was like riding a roller coaster through the city on a crisp spring morning with fresh air and  birdsong blasting from the trees around me as my soundtrack. One I'd many corona moments I will never forget."
2020-05-18 10:22:29,"You should do a story on the congestion and pollution now found in the Hamptons, Catskills and other places of escape.

I'm curious. And be sure to interview the locals in those areas."
2020-05-18 10:34:52,"This article was true 6 weeks ago but certainly not now or even 4 weeks ago. The traffic is getting worse and worse. I’ve been driving from Brooklyn to the Bronx for about 6 weeks. Everyday there are accidents (5 car pile up on fdr last week) and slowdowns. There are always a few cars dangerously speeding, weaving
 in and out. Perhaps the scene is better than it was, but nothing like what the author has described."
2020-05-18 11:07:16,"Yes traffic is light but more folks are driving this month for sure. That being said there is serious speeding and reckless driving on both local streets and the highways.
For Pedestrians the bicycle and scooter delivery folks ignore basic traffic rules. They ride the wrong way, ignore traffic signals and ride on the sidewalks. There is absolutely no enforcement!
The Administration has removed any consequences for these types of behavior, I fear it will only get worse when we open up."
2020-05-18 11:08:15,"I'm hoping against hope that the city takes this opportunity to permanently close some streets to traffic. the last few weeks have been a gift to pedestrians and, personally, I never want to go back."
2020-05-18 11:32:14,"It is eery. Has anyone else had the brief moment when you look about you and think could we few be the last survivors? Whatever else comes out of this, and it will be a lot, we need to focus on preventing the severity of the next pandemic and focus as well on climate change and nuclear proliferation. There is no excuse if we don't. Great universities should begin courses to think and write about those crises we have not even imagined. This crisis represented a failure of imagination. I readily admit I borrowed that description but it is not less true for that."
2020-05-18 11:53:24,"This golden age for driving is already ending. Outside of Manhattan, the traffic and traffic jams have returned. Getting rid of cars is not the answer. Getting rid of rideshare services, such as Lyft and Uber, would help more than words can say."
2020-05-18 11:54:52,"On the Sunday that NY shut down, I picked up my daughter in Brooklyn. Mid-semesters tests now complete, the school decided to go online. They encouraged, but did not demand that students could go home. Later I learned the reason for the unsubtle encouragement - her hospital was becoming a Covid-only center.

I met no traffic on the FDR, cruised to the Brooklyn Bridge without any impediment. In Brooklyn, I cruised Flatbush Avenue, through light after light, not stopping, not meeting much other traffic.

We feel that we evacuated our daughter rather than bringing her home."
2020-05-18 12:02:16,"My first thought on this article was, ""This would be an amazing time and unprecedented opportunity to film movies or TV shows in Manhattan."" Until, of course, I realized the obvious problem with that idea."
2020-05-18 12:12:24,I'm used to egress/ingress from NYC at 3am so this looks kind of normal except for the day-for-day lighting
2020-05-18 12:14:29,"It’s true that, at the beginning of the pandemic, there were very few cars on Fifth Avenue and other Manhattan streets and highways. However, the number of cars and trucks has been rising steadily through April and May. In fact, this morning at 6:30, 5th Avenue was notably busier than it’s been since the March low. And I saw many cars with New Jersey and Connecticut plates pulling into city garages. Are some offices reopening? That would be worth investigating."
2020-05-18 12:20:24,"Actually, last Tuesday around 4PM the West Side Highway was no country lane -- the familiar back-up before the GWB exit was totally happening. There is traffic in the city for sure, and people are out. Thankfully, almost everyone is wearing a mask and keeping a cautious distance."
2020-05-18 13:08:30,"Meanwhile, California freeways are only slightly less busy, despite reports of drivers being busted for going 100 mph on the empty 5 and 101 and 405 (aka the Parking Lot). This is odd because there's still nowhere to go that's open; even visiting friends is tricky because at least one is genuinely frightened of the danger of contagion. But it confirms my long-held suspicions that people do freeways merely for its own sake. The last couple of months have been a boon for recluses and agoraphobics."
2020-05-18 13:26:40,"It is a glorious feeling. Many years ago, I found myself on I-95, mistakenly about to cross the George Washington bridge. I bailed off and found myself on Broadway. It was around 7:30AM on a Sunday. I went the WHOLE length of Broadway, nonstop, hitting every light green. Oh, what a feeling."
2020-05-18 13:36:38,"I’ve never seen the streets in Manhattan so clean! I wish I could experience it in person. Years ago, when I lived there, one Sunday, in summer, I remember my husband and I riding bikes down 5th Ave with very few cars on the road- it was joyous! I urge people to take advantage of this strange dystopian city before it gets crazy again."
2020-05-18 13:51:37,"A different world and one I thought I would never see. My biggest aggravation has been the 6 foot waiting lines outside of stores. 

I hope we all both learn from this and survive it."
2020-05-18 14:32:40,"here in EU, we were there two months ago. Empty roads, sidewalks... Also strange goods went missing on shelfs, like wall paint, because everybody had the same idea what to do with the lock down time.  Then it all crept back, also in strange way because everybody went to hobby markets and home depots. They were first businesses open and since it's springtime, everyone is at home and all walls are painted, here comes the garden and balcony and car stand...I suspect there would be another defenestration if they didn't let people in home depots and gvt knew this..haven't had one for couple hundred years.. now traffic is back to normal and the last thing missing is pubs, that's tricky since we pretty much invented modern beer here but obviously it's a major weak spot."
2020-05-18 14:37:00,"What is really sad about this, is that there are no pedestrians either."
2020-05-18 14:42:16,"30 years ago I used to take a cab from my home up to 86th and Broadway in the middle of the night to drop off manuscripts with my typesetter (he lived literally next door to Isaac Bashevis Singer). Coming back, we'd fly downtown, going 70mph, only running into heavier traffic crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.

Looks like that traffic is back, during the daytime, if only temporarily."
2020-05-18 14:45:18,Hmmm maybe employers￼ Could begin to deploy small shuttle buses which would allow for social distancing instead of having individual employees driving into the city. And to think that the New York subway system might be due for an overhaul!
2020-05-18 14:52:18,"I was born in the Bronx in 1947. I don't recall NY looking like this at any time except perhaps a Sunday in Manhattan when retail stores were closed.  I think the saddest thing is not seeing throngs of people, families with children and general bustle of a city and the communities within the city.  There were always gatherings of people at the beaches, boardwalks, parks, the theater district, Times Square, Central Park and all over Brooklyn and Queens. It is indeed ""Post Apocalyptic"" and  sort of like a scene out of an episode of The Twilight Zone where lonely survivors of a shattered world wander about, dazzled and confused, wondering where life has gone.  
Please come back soon New York! The world is far brighter with your life giving heart beat."
2020-05-18 15:00:17,"Had an essential duty last week, going from Jersey City to Williamsburg. Took me 11 minutes flat. Grew up learning to drive here and it reminded so much of those long gone days. I know NYC is better without cars, but boy did I enjoy the flashback to my youth."
2020-05-18 15:04:31,As positive as this probably is for the environment don't forget it implies that thousands and thousands are jobless and struggle financially to feed their loved ones.
2020-05-18 01:59:25,Why don't you do a bike ride perspective?
2020-05-18 02:15:51,How many of these comments are from people who have left the City due to the pandemic?
2020-05-18 04:31:05,"I'm really sick and tired of all the images of Manhattan below 96th Street, come uptown,  to the Bronx, etc where pple stayed because we don't have the resources to flee like the wealthy, here traffic flows, people are everywhere and to make things worse,  East Harlem gets one three block open street while the UWS gets 2 streets stretching over several blocks!"
2020-05-18 14:14:31,Feels like driving in Tokyo on a normal day.
2020-05-18 02:05:53,Looks like a scene from one of those video games.
2020-05-18 05:21:12,"This reads like you live in the burbs and have a short, cliché ridden view of NYC. Over 46 years I’ve stood in likely thousands of lines and remember all as “waiting patiently” - you missed the decades of movie lines as a very N.Y. social activity even city-dweller bonding. 
Your descriptions of driving as both “post-apocalyptic” and “normal” are contradictory: normal is traffic and energy. This is not normal."
2020-05-18 05:57:50,Perfect time for film directors to get their library of shots.
2020-05-18 06:55:58,"This article made me chuckle. 

I recall the traffic reports on WINS radio when I was a kid. 

""Bumpa ta Bumpa on the uppa BQE!""

Some things we can do without. 
Some things we'll hate to see return."
2020-05-18 10:35:55,"Empty streets.
Parking aplenty.

You can ride up 6th Ave from Canal Street to Central Park South (doing the speed limit) and not get stopped by one red light.

Strange, but quite pleasant"
2020-05-18 11:16:51,"Social distancing? People are walking in bike lanes, walking in the streets! Where are the promised miles of pedestrianized streets?"
2020-05-18 11:59:41,"Agreed I experienced the same thing here in Bklyn.

However one should not abuse it (not this man if he was doing it for a legit story) by taking joy rides or cross country trips since the more you do and stop to eat/fill up, you are exposing yourself to the covid 19.

I only drive my car now to get food and help others seniors get food from free food bank type outlets and nothing else. 

However, I do admit, it is a joy to ride in Bklyn now like it is a country road. Also suspension of alternate side lets me look for food every day not just on weekends."
2020-05-18 13:11:31,"These are interesting observations, but I wish my neighbors at the NY Times would spend more time covering what is actually going on the streets of our midtown neighborhood. Aggressive panhandling, mentally ill and  addicted homeless, open drug dealing, drag racing on 42nd and all up and down the West Side highway. I live in a building that has a high percentage of seniors and many are afraid to even venture out for a loaf of bread. We have complained here in HK about a lack of police presence but when they actually are here their hands seem tied by what they can do given the current political climate. Talk about apocalyptic. Come to my neighborhood, your own neighborhood NY Times and see for yourself."
2020-05-18 11:01:10,"Waste - ""To use, consume, spend, or expend thoughtlessly or carelessly.""

Americans waste 75% of our transportation energy (now our biggest source of GHG) according to the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. 

Do we care: about breathing non-chunky air? About less COPD? Less asthma - especially among our beloved kids? Fewer heart attacks? Reduced health care cost? Improved water quality? Reduced traffic noise? Better views?

If each American driver drove just 6% fewer miles, we would realize: 150 Billion fewer miles driven, $5 Billion less in gasoline expense, $6 Billion in reduced road maintenance, $26 Billion in reduced accident expenses, 60 Million metric tons of GHG, 2,400 lives saved…

Do we care enuf'? Tick, tick, tick…"
2020-05-18 12:18:08,"I had to run a short errand into Manhattan from my home last week. It was eerie indeed, and reminded me of two things. First, back during the Cold War, this country was developing a nuclear weapon (the neutron bomb) which would leave property intact but destroy all life.

A few years before that, MGM released a film entitled ""The World, the Flesh, and the Devil"" about three living people in a Manhattan which was rendered without life due to radioactive fallout from a war. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World,_the_Flesh_and_the_Devil_(1959_film"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World,_the_Flesh_and_the_Devil_(1959_film</a>) That same year saw the release of the poignant film version of Nevil Shute's ""On the Beach.""

2020-05-18 13:37:48,"Oh boy! I would LOVE to take a drive on the eternal parking lot known as the LIE into the city and drive around.
What joy it would be after negotiating NYC and surrounding suburbia traffic for 55 years now. Into the city in 20 minutes!!
It does makes us realize what we have been missing, the only regret being this came about because of a deathly virus."
2020-05-18 03:31:59,What charming visuals and clear evidence that we should ban all private car traffic in NYC to return the space usurped by cars to human traffic whether pedestrian or bicycle (and stop polluting New Yorkers' lungs to boot).
2020-05-18 04:21:20,"I should get the car from the garage, take it for a drive. what should I play: Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Some slow sad movement from a soviet era symphony or stay quiet? New York City is sort of hallow place."
2020-05-18 10:16:46,"I can finally get around driving in NYC, but as soon as I hit 140mph my car starts to shake uncontrollably."
2020-05-18 13:25:52,Exactly why the streets should be repaved now...so many bad potholes etc.....
2020-05-18 12:20:29,Enjoy the empty streets while you can. This will be a memory in a few months.
2020-05-18 13:20:07,"This article has already been overtaken by events.  The streets are filling back up; the hi-speed on the LIE is back to bumper to bumper crawl, and with fear of trains and buses, commuters are going to jam the streets worse than before in their cars."
2020-05-18 15:19:30,The only thing I like about the pandemic is the traffic. Having an hour drive reduced to 12 minutes is as exhilarating as it is unsustainable.
2020-05-18 15:40:42,"I left NYC in 2015 and have missed it ever since.  I miss these streets, walking trips over the Brooklyn bridge (where I asked my wife to marry me), driving down the winding West Side highway next to the mighty Hudson as the GW comes into view at dawn and late afternoon adventures up Riverside drive past those grand old apartments in the late afternoon in Spring when home was Riverdale.  I miss walking along Prospect Park West on a cool summer's night at 11 PM.  This feels ""Post-Apocalyptic"" to you, but these videos are a salve for nostalgia to me.  Thank you for filming and posting these drives.  Please post more."
2020-05-18 15:45:44,"This line that they quoted on NY1 before,  ""It cannot last, of course; nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the West Side Highway"" has an association for me  about another change that we may see, that just going casually to a show mightn't be something to be taken for granted. There was a play in the early 1990s that starred Dolores Grey and Helen Gallagher, and it was early in Julie Halston's career, which was considered not very good as theater which is how critics evaluated it correctly, which differs from the fun night out most of us really care about.   I read a review describing  how cheap the jokes were, that they sunk to the level of ""Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does my cleaning lady.""  I howled at that and my thought:  ""Gee, the humor is THAT cheap, huh?"", better go and laugh and see Dolores Grey live onstage before it closed  and loved sharing the sitcom laughs with a full house - even though the play was overall not art.  

I was so glad I could just go same day, just laugh and not worry about the artistry.  I've got to winder:  Are the days of just going to a play on a whim with no preparation for $15, packed house just laughing, five feet from Dolores Grey (a huge deal back then) spouting zingers a thing of the past?

2020-05-18 14:42:45,"I think Jerome Powell is trying to put on a brave face, while inwardly he must know that the US economy is in a deep recession. The coronavirus was merely the trigger for that recession. We all knew a recession was coming, but the trigger is always a surprise, and this time it's a respiratory virus. 

The depth of the recession will not be apparent until after the pandemic has passed and business resumes. The commercial bankruptcies are just beginning, and we're about to find out which corporations the debt burdens that they accumulated over the past decade. As for small, local businesses, many will go bankrupt unless consumers visit them at pre-pandemic levels in a hurry. The hospitality and travel sector seems likely to suffer the most, as it is the least necessary. And that represents a huge number of service workers. 

Meanwhile the Fed will keep the big banks afloat, and Wall Street will look shiny and happy. Because capital always needs a place to invest itself, and there's a lot of capital sloshing around out there."

 How can a government move forward when its content to live in the past? 

Shouldn't we be asking ourselves  what  an economy looks like with 25% unemployment and an extended depression?

Powell boiled the recovery down to one word- 'confidence'.
Who out there in the political world has a vision for the future that can  instill confidence? 

When do we begin to build for the future? When, as a nation, as we did in 1776, invoke our freedom to decide how we want to live, rather than remaining  the quiet, subservient majority unwilling to risk the present for the future?"

2020-05-18 15:22:52,"The Fed Chairman is likely to feel a recession of his own this week for his remarks May 13th, and his appearences with 60 minutes and NPR.  The adage of measure twice, cut once is also a tool we use to listen and read - the Powell thoughts are what he appeared to subtlety say in a second look: this is going to last and the pain will now start spreading to a wider audience.  The Fed Chairman's specific call out of large sporting events not occurring implies that the health risks for people, the healthcare system, and all the rest far and wide will take longer as we must be certain, cautious, and we must continue to nourish the economy to get there.  Or is it simply a plea for leaders to accept data, facts, and the real world at the moment?  Is it a possible that the Administration and McConnell have been briefed by groups and people whose strangle hold on the rest of us is now starting to hurt them as well, and that a rushed opening with casualties of Americans is preferred over losses to their portfolios?

After all, who employs or supports first responders, public heath, nurses and other medical professionals, teachers and many others? The states do!  If you think the unemployment rate is terrible now, wait until states-currently drowning in debt- have to submit their balanced budgets by June 30!

These are all barriers for medical workers seeking help, as no one wants to see people in person right now and those that have insurances that don't reimburse or reimburse poorly will have their cases passed over by treaters for financial reasons. 

Congress always gives lip service to funding mental health.  Here's an easy way to do something and this will actually save lives and decrease suffering."
2020-05-16 16:46:45,"I struggled with untreated PTSD for years.  I was on AA 1420 that crashed  in Little Rock in 1999.  I was seated over the left wing.  The three passengers in front of me didn't make it out.

Unresolved PTSD always finds a way out.  It's like bamboo.  The roots don't grow very deep.  They have to be within a foot of the topsoil for nutrients.  Those shallow roots continue to grow in every direction but down creating new bamboo.  Have you walked through a bamboo grove?  It's hard getting around those dense trees.

My buddy got back from his fourth tour in Afghanistan.  He immediately understood my bamboo grove and referred me to a PTSD therapist he had been working with at the VA.  This therapist taught me Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).  

It took a few years to burn down my bamboo grove, but it has remained infertile ground for nearly seven years now.

I encourage everyone to explore EMDR if you are struggling with PTSD.  It's been an effective treatment for tens of thousands of our military men and women returning from wars overseas."
2020-05-16 16:47:24,"EMDR truly works if you have a highly- trained trauma therapist. I have C-PTSD from multiple traumas and sought help for many years before finding one who really knew what she was doing. It only took a couple of EMDR sessions with my therapist for my brain to automatically know what to do. This is the only therapy I've ever had where I always walk out of the therapist's office feeling better than when I walked in. Always. 


I know how frightening it is to seek help. I used to say that if I went *there*, all the king's horses and all the king's men wouldn't even be able to find the pieces to put me back again--and I couldn't afford to fall apart because my kids needed me. That's a normal fear but I discovered that it's simply not true. Not with EMDR. 


EMDR works by getting the traumatized side of your brain (which acts as a protective gatekeeper) to communicate safely with the logical and analytical side of your brain so you can ""see"" and feel clearly without feeling traumatized. Your brain then files the memories in a different part of your brain that bypasses your lizard- brain (the part that causes your body to react before you even know what's going on). 

I can sleep now. I don't fear (usually), but when I do I'm now able to process it very quickly. 

Please find the help you need. It IS out there. xo"

2020-05-16 16:54:00,"We of the medical profession are by nature compassionate and empathetic.  And we are trained to rise above our innate human characteristics, and I emphasize ""human, to transcend and focus on the total care of our patients.  This is not too difficult during ""normal"" times.  But we are not living, witnessing, and experiencing normal times right now.  I remember working as an RN during the AID's epidemic, at a time when we knew very little about this disease.  We were fearful, indeed, but could not betray any vulnerable emotions to those in our care.  In hindsight, what we went through pales in comparison to what our doctors, nurses, and paramedics are enduring now.  They are human beings, after all, neither gods nor super heroes.  That is fiction, not reality, to expect more from these marvelous and already extraordinary women and men.  I wish I could say to them personally that we get it; it is okay to be human right now.  Their vulnerabilities are humanity's.  We understand; we empathize.  We need them.  But most crucially, they need themselves to be whole of mind as well as body.  Please, take care of yourselves, too.  You are worthy and deserve mental hugs and TLC."

2020-05-16 17:00:41,"Many a tender-hearted soul was drawn to nursing, for me, medicine. 

As l recall during the HIV epidemic in the 80s, gay loved ones, if not family members, couldn’t visit- even as their long term partners were on death’s door. In some ways that was a major impetus for gays needing rights for spousal equity. 

As a deeply wounded being myself, A good listener, and automatic empath, every shift had at least one wrenching moment. I went home exhausted and depleted- often needing to numb myself. I’m glad I learned to manage empathy even though I needed to quit medicine to do it.

That said, our healthcare system is incomplete and fragmented for those with chronic dis-ease. 

With Nih grant funding cuts, medical leaders are dependent on pharma for research monies and closely toe their political line. their lack of interest and ability to formally acknowledge in a systematic way, the very real impacts of the “mind- body” continuum is myopic. 

I’m including emotional, mental, and spiritual drivers of dis-ease, our day to day stressful lifestyle (which we indulge in like addicts), role of  Adverse Childhood Experiences, and consumption non-food diet. Why aren’t we researching how to engage the placebo effect? 

Until then, our American medical healthcare - will continue to keep people sick, isolated. and codependent. It must evolve from its current model if we are to truly address root causes for its incipient failure.

2020-05-16 17:37:51,"Tho I am a psychologist now, I worked as a registered respiratory therapist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta when AIDS blew across the city, frightening all medical workers, terrified we would inadvertently stick ourselves with a needle, etc.,—-  our challenge then was a dress rehearsal for the here & now.  

 I remember one particular patient, his lover coming in and kissing him tho he was intubated;  he was wearing cowboy boots, a tall commanding man. I was standing next to his ventilator looking out the window across Atlanta as the sun was coming up. 

Somehow that scene of the sun rising is emblematic to what is taking place here. I think that what we are witnessing currently, which is a public display of massive angst, is merely a fire drill for this fall and winter, I’m afraid. I am struggling to come up with formulations in my mind which may act as a mediator and/or bulwark to what is getting ready to come down."
2020-05-16 18:02:18,"One of the worse feelings I had ever experience, PTSD.  Mine came from years of taking care of my parents, both declining in health and with working,  raising a family, it took a toll.  The everyday reaction, having no control of anything in my life than losing hope then wanting the pain to end it.  When this was happening back in March that was the first thought I had for our health care workers and first responders, they will be not only be suffering physically but mentally.  No human being can withstand the constant attack of seeing pain, of seeing death.  It wears you down to having your mental health traumatized. It is not possible to not be affected.  Hoping affordable, available support services will be there for all of our responders for years to come.  It doesn’t go away overnight."

We offer pro bono services and E.M.D.R. to healthcare professionals and first responders in NYC who are helping those affected by Covid-19 (including E.M.S., F.D.N.Y., and N.Y.P.D.).  Our goal is to help prevent long term P.T.S.D., depression, anxiety, and other negative effects of the stress our healthcare professionals and first responders are dealing with.  Our team served many first responders in NYC after 9/11 with very good results.  E.M.D.R. is recognized as a highly effective treatment for trauma by the American Psychiatric Association, International Society of Traumatic Stress Studies, Department of Veteran's Affairs/Department of Defense, and the World Health Organization.

But there are people protesting keep safe measures, many claiming that the whole thing is a sham.  Inside the hospital, the reality is different, too - we still lack in PPE we need.  Hospital administration, safe in their offices, has been cutting our resources and cutting our frontline staff as they try to protect their profits.  It is hard to keep running 100% at work when my teams are slashed, our hours cut, and positions are eliminated because hospital profits are being protected."

I related to the comment about the uncertainty of how long all this will last just adding to the stress healthcare workers feel.  It affects all of us, even those not on the front lines.

Another quote that really got to me, concerned peer-to-peer counseling, “No one else understands what we’re going through,” Ms. Burke, the ICU nurse said. “It doesn’t sound like much, but that program has changed the world for us.”""    
I'm sure it has.  Programs like  Alcoholics Anonymous are effective precisely because members share the same burdens.

You say you're fine one day and the next day you crash. I use the Crisis Text Line for help. They're really good. I find that when I express my emotions to them, it helps me think through and process my experience. I'm hoping this crisis winds down so we don't have to be on emergency mode 24/7. I found last night that telling myself it was OK to be nervous, it was OK to be scared, it was OK to feel it wasn't OK, really helped me get to sleep."
2020-05-16 18:42:20,"My heart goes out to all health workers - you are all giving more than most of us can imagine. There is another group of people who are going to need help as we all go through this - family members and loved ones who send their parents, spouses, brothers and sisters off to what is a likely death - alone-, or, we hope, at best,  with someone who is not so overwhelmed, who is loving and willing, to hold their hand, sing to them, rub their backs, as they pass from this world. And we do this knowing that as much as that person might want to, he or she can not provide the comfort that we could - just because of who we are. The guilt, regardless of the fact that we had no choice in the matter, is like drowning, and like Dr. Cohen, many of us will forever ask ourselves if we 'caused' their infection and subsequent lonely death."
2020-05-16 18:59:59,"As a retired RN and later a hospice chaplain (interfaith), I'm all too familiar with burnout.  I retired to be a 24/7 caregiver for my husband who has Parkinson's disease. Longterm caregiving, acute and/or chronic care leaves one empty, no matter how much you love you have for the person or your patients. Our usual coping and self-care don't longer work. 

If you have never done intensive care, in a hospital, home, or nursing home, you have NO idea how draining and depleting it can be.  By now nurses are overwhelmed from the Corvid-19 peak and even though cases are down, they haven't had the rest and care they need.  

We need to lift the burden off the backs of our magnificent caregivers and give them 'rest', relief, freedom from worry and angst and let them work through the sadness and grief.  We must forestal their leaving, while feeling a lost of meaning and purpose.  Some may even blame themselves.  Nursing, especially is a tough, tough job even in the best of times.  In my state, MA where a nurse staffing referendum was defeated by hospital industry forces.  

It's like a well. Draw off too much water for too long, and it goes empty, depleted, dry. Depression and PTSD follow in a 'dose/response' way. The more intense the care situation, the worse the longterm trauma and the more emotional, psychological, physical care they need. They need to be ""held"" like they 'held' by their family, friends, and the medical system itself.  We must innovate here."
2020-05-16 19:10:55,"All health care workers should have access to Critical Incident De-Briefing.  This process is regularly used in hospitals and fire-departments if a patient is lost or not saved from an accident.  There are certain stress markers and signs when a worker needs more intervention.  While these de-briefings usually occur within a hospital or a fire station or police station, on-line debriefings should be regularly available to these professionals, and those who are having nightmares, and whose relationships and sleep continue to be disrupted should get specific followup.  This is the standard for practice."

Both groups share a preference to address everyone else's needs first and put our own last - it feels good and it's easier.  But line of work trauma (in addition to all the other trauma) is cumulative, and many develop PTSD.  There are different evidence-based treatments for trauma, EMDR being one of them.  And mindfulness has been demonstrated to be another tool in the toolbox for dealing with symptoms, and is particularly helpful in turning off the rumination.  Even in Canada I frequently recommend the free apps available through the American VA including Mindfulness Coach and PTSD Coach.  Finding something you can control in a sea of the uncontrollable is essential."
2020-05-16 19:27:57,"ICU physician here. My appeal to all EMT's, nurses, respiratory therapists, doctors and all medical brothers/sisters in this very difficult time-please take care of yourselves. Please start some form of meditation and spiritual practice. Even 5-10 minutes before your shift and at the end of the day will help. Center your mind and surrender to a 'higher' power which operates through you. There is a ton of resources online (Jack Kornfield is a good start). But please realize meditation takes time and the mind is very hard to tame. We must heal our insides first. No-one realizes what we go through. We were already wounded before COVID struck-burdened by EMR, pressures of corporate medicine, hamster in wheel schdules, RVU's, burnout, assembly line medicine etc. etc.. Bu now to see so much of death and suffering-and all at once. This is going to finish us emotionally if we don't pay attention to inner self.

Unfortunately, that does not always serve us well.   When we experience deep sadness and grief, and bury it deep in our minds, and when those experiences are repetitive  and cumulative, we end up carrying a burden no human can bear.  It is much healthier to trust your feelings and to give them expression, privately if you must, although publicly would be better - for yourself and for those  who see you as a role model.

I believe one of the areas that needs attention is the quality of the leadership of our hospitals.  Often times, and perhaps more often these days, hospitals are run by MBAs or such people, business people who make huge salaries and never really even know what working in an emergency or surgical department, for example, involves, both emotionally and physically.  Large and well appointed offices on the top floors of the hospital strangely symbolize their place.  Such people, if my bluntness can be forgiven, leach from those who actually do the critical and difficult work  More and more, doctors and nurses and all other hospital workers become controlled by those who have no actual humility in the face of healing other people.  To them, when all the rhetoric is stripped away, it might as well be running a McDonald's franchise."
2020-05-16 19:43:00,"PTSD literally rewires the brain. It’s similar to a traumatic brain injury. When these heroic frontline workers feel suicidal thoughts, or stress markers that if left untreated could become suicidal thoughts, it’s because their brains stop being able to process emotional stress in a healthy way. 

PTSD is NOT a sign of weakness but a sign of a person’s deep caring and empathy, Quite simply, PTSD occurs when someone has been strong for too long. We all have a breaking point. I had a breaking point when I was a teacher — regarding abused kids and the stress that arose from jumping through hoops to get kids out of abusive situations. When we see a person in pain, it’s hard for a person without a thick shell to bear.

There’s no way that I could do what they’re doing, and I can totally understand the anger some are feeling when they see people in Walmart, wearing better masks than they have been provided. It’s unconscionable that this is happening. I’m thankful that therapists are lining up to provide free services because this type of complex trauma will take lots of time and TLC to heal.

Not that healthcare workers have a lot of free time, but PTSD can be helped through ART. Painting, drawing, anything using one’s head, hands and heart to create. I’ve seen art therapy help children with PTSD. Maybe we could send healthcare workers things like adult coloring books and art supplies? Is that cheesy? I know they’d rather have PPE, but... art truly can help. 

God bless you all!"

As a physician throughout my training and career I have had experiences in Emergency Departments of meeting ambulances delivering people with horrible gunshot wounds, brain hemorrhages, spinal cord injuries, cardiac arrests, severe burns, etc.  Outside of the Emergency Department I have delivered terrible and tragic news to patients and families, and pronounced people dead as their relatives waited outside the hospital room.  At no time was I asked by my mentors, department heads, or hospital administrators how I was doing emotionally following these heartbreaking experiences.

Last week, he visited his family in New Jersey during Mother's Day to drop off some gifts for his sister and sister-in-law, also both nurses, all from a safe distance of their house. We talked on the phone on his drive back to Queens, and he lamented not being able to hug his nephews and nieces.

They are only doing video or phone visits.  If we have a non virus related problem, attention is lacking.  A older couple in the waiting room were discussing their son's possible cancer and the difficulty in seeing someone.  They came from hundreds of miles away in a rural county.  They have a large hospital close by but it is mostly closed.  The medical community here still have the worse fears and anxiety and are mostly closed.  We all have our fears from lack of diagnosis, bankrupcies, cancer.  It is all messing with our heads."

When I worked in a hospital emergency department many years ago we changed from our street clothes into scrubs at the beginning of our shift and back into street clothes when we went home for the day.  The hospital laundry service supplied and washed the scrubs. There was no epidemic.  It's basic infection control.  There was no need for anyone to wear scrubs outside of the hospital. We left the contamination at work.  We had lockers. Not once, never, never, did I have a nightmare about what I saw in the job, but I could tell you many horror stories.

While we attempt to use logic to persuade others to take appropriate safety measures to save lives, our efforts are offset by a con man who stirs up anger and will go to any end to retain power. Every few days Trump raises the death count by 20 thousand as though the number was trivial and acceptable but when you see the faces of the victims, gasping for breath, the mental anguish first responders & families experience cannot be measured in GDP.

In my medical opinion, Trump is terribly unbalanced and the 25th amendment should be used to remove him. Trump sycophants who follow him blindly need to spend a few days in my ICU to understand why more testing, contact tracing, and PPE is essential. Other countries had these tools, but because of Trump, America lags in everything except death count.

Besides talk based modalities, space must be allowed for the basics.....quality food, sleep, and movement. Last, support is not just about the individual...it’s about the group...brothers and sisters in the bond. If there is empathy at the top, the tools and resources are there.

Perhaps the most rage-inducing statement I've encountered to date from one of these deniers is an assertion that doctors and nurses are, en masse, writing up false death certificates so as to perpetuate the ""hoax.""  Nearly lost it over that one!

My job puts me in contact with dozens of health care workers on a regular basis, many who work in ICU wards. we talk and I have had them break down and cry because of two reasons. First the incredible numbers of deaths they have had to endure and the lack of support they have felt because of the sorry state of PPE's.
   These are people who have been around the death of patients there entire career. They are not prima donna's. But the sheer numbers combined with the knowledge that most of the steps they take will fail has put them under incredible, soul shattering stress. This is about as close to a war zone condition as you can get. These brave men and women need to be taken care of. The PTSD is real and if you come across them in your life please thank them and recognize their sacrifice. When this is over they are going to need professional help."

There is no sense of containment- that there is competent leadership leading an effective scientifically and medically based response.  This is the environment that medical workers are working in.  Of course they worry that this will never end.  Of course they feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility and crushing despair.  They are the ones dealing with the death and grief day in and day out while they hear the president advising people to inject bleach and stop testing. Doctors, nurses, medical workers, they are all smart and educated people.  They, more than anyone else, understand the impact of the negligent and reckless federal response.  They, more than anyone, understand the impact of the disinformation campaign spread by the federal government.  And they, more than anyone, are dealing with the fallout of Trump's reckless disregard for human life, with no end in sight."

We have no need for that kind of pity. It is a base form of reaction to this world crisis.  Please respect us, care for us as much as we do for you and do not shun us in public for treating (mentally and physically) the infected, the scared, and the underserved. Health care professionals are wired to respond to promote wellbeing. In the pre-COVID 19 world, we would be given high fatty foods and sugar treats to somehow repay us for the the care that is given.

All lock-down states have exemptions for ""essential"" workers -- bus drivers and grocery-store workers, for example -- regardless of how close those ""essential"" workers come to hundreds of others.

But those same lock=down states do not have exemptions for ""non-essential"" workers -- trail-maintenance workers, for example (whose entire park may well be closed) -- even those whose jobs can easily be performed 6 feet from the nearest other person. 

Should we force  bus drivers and grocery-store clerks to work, but prohibit trail-maintenance people from working? In other words, isn't the definition of ""essential"" really geared entirely for our benefit, not the worker's?

I certainly agree that many jobs are ""essential"" -- bus drivers and grocery store clerks, for example. But why shouldn't other workers keep their jobs if their work can be performed at a much greater distance than, say, bus drivers and grocery store clerks? If a ""non-essential"" business can show that it can be conducted with all workers staying 6 feet apart (which bus drivers and grocery-store workers obviously can't show), shouldn't that business be allowed to operate?"
2020-05-16 20:34:37,"Becoming a medical worker takes a special person with a grit and determination. When I was on the cross roads of deciding whether to be a physician, scientist or a pharmacist, I had to do a lot of soul searching. I was a softy. I had not seen more than 2 or 3 people die. One not so old, died in front of my eyes after falling from a tall ladder and his bleeding body that had turned blue was creepy and sent a chill up my spine. I knew then that I was incapable of handling death even though I knew that not every person will die of old age in their bed. 

So I decided to become a scientist. Okay, so I have killed trillions of viruses, both benign and deadly while testing antivirals and researched what would be best for any upcoming pandemics and published my work in 2005, 2008, 2018 and just 3 months ago in a book I authored and being distributed by Amazon. I have no PTSD but right now I am traumatized by how the world could have benefited from my research if only they cared to spend a few minutes to read my guidance on how to survive this cruel pandemic. In Feb., my publication outlined steps on how to take care of ourselves with COVID-19 making its rounds and many in the city I live in, who cared to listen are well aware of a virus killer liquid that can be safely taken by mouth. 

I understand the plight of medical workers and I am not a psychiatrist or a psychologist but I feel your pain and all I can say is get help and for God sake don't end your life or overdose on meds."
2020-05-16 20:41:01,"While I appreciate the dangers faced daily by those in the trenches, no one is writing about all the behind the scenes workers who have been equally impacted by all of this. A person installing computer hardware or fixing a tv or handling blood specimens is equally at risk of getting sick yet gets zero acknowledgement. They also don’t get the satisfaction of ever knowing if the person behind the specimen or whose tv was broken ever made it out the door. 

It’s even worse for those who keep the now mandatory IT application backbone up and running. Imagine if all of this was going on and we still had paper charts! We’re all mostly working remote now so we know a war is going on and we’re actively involved in it but all we get are statistics and more demands to make things easier, faster, better, safer. 

Luckily the leadership where I work is smart enough to recognize that PTSD can hit any one of us hard even if we don’t see patients. They’ve made mental health resources available to everyone, not only front line staff."

I have the utmost respect for our doctors, nurses, and all other medical professionals and first responders.  Their mental health is extremely important.

It's not just our medical personnel who are suffering with the repercussions of Covid-19.  It's also the public.

It's not possible to deal with the constant barrage of media coverage of this pandemic, the stress, and the unrelenting terror of getting the disease or possibly dying from it, without sustaining some kind of mental trauma.  The most likely lasting effect will be PTSD, OCD, or some other mental illness.

This has created a 'mystery' around death and dying patients for many healthcare workers. This is unfortunate. It is unnecessary for nurses, docs, etc to be traumatized when a patient dies.

I listened to Veterans talk about traumas that left them baffled as to why they were alive when so many others were not.  The idea that death or survival was largely random was too out of control; better to be guilty of somehow failing to do enough, assuming  guilt rather than  accepting helplessness. Guilt which left them feeling their membership in the  human race was forfeit; living in endless  purgatory. Nowhere was this belief more prevalent than amongst the medics, tasked with preserving life, but  constantly having  to choose who to save. First responders, nurses and physicians on the front lines are all at high risk of feeling overwhelmed, inadequate in impossible circumstances. It’s heartbreaking to think about the cost to these heroic people, victims of a time in our history when we were governed by the inadequate and irresponsible."

   The psychological cost of war is always high. It's extremely helpful that some of the hospitals have peer counselors and other programs in place to help these workers deal with this unprecedented rate of death. I can only hope that those institutions that don't yet have these programs will be able to develop them as quickly as possible. 

   The reality is, even with the best professional help, the frontline workers still face daunting long lasting effects. Tough times indeed."
2020-05-16 21:52:03,"I am very familiar with PTSD and want to say to everyone who is affected by this, you can get through this. There will be times you question yourself & hold yourself to such an impossible standard of ""if only I could have"" .... When you do, allow yourself to grieve for the person that was lost but also allow yourself to remember all of the other ones that you saved. Remember that it is not you that is going insane, but that these are insane times. There is no road map for this.

Hug yourself and remember you were and are there when others needed you most. And you deserve to accord yourself with the same level of care. Above all, talk to someone who will just listen. It took me years to finally find the balance from my war so many years ago when I had to zip into body bags people even younger than my 21 years. Holding it in for so long prolonged the grieving and the healing.  

You can get through this. For me, talking with other veterans who shared a similar journey and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) helped tremendously. The latter has helped me with strategies to maintain my peace as over the years I've encountered numerous triggers, COVID-19 being the latest.  

I wish I could give each of you a hug and a glimpse that you will not always feel this pain so acutely."

2. OUTRAGE at those who have put my extended family of health care providers, from janitors & up to the Medical Chiefs of Staff at every & all institutions [Govt, NFPs, For Profit Corps etc] for not having a MINIMUM of 2-3 mos of Maximum supplies of PPE on hand, in storage prepared for the worst scenarios, because of fiscal concerns.

For a decade, I have had a front line teaching job as an adjunct at a state college in South Florida for wages rarely topping $ 25,000 per year along with working 2- 3 other jobs. We have no benefits, no health insurance, no job security, no social security, etc. Most recently we had to convert to remote teaching with minimal training, a process that took me and countless other colleagues, dozens of hours for which we will never be paid. I was told 'this is how it is' or to 'turn in my keys'. We also had to deal, single handedly, with virus related traumas our students were encountering. Again without training and compensation adding overwhelming personal stress to each of us -  yet to even be acknowledged by the college. Granted we do not deal with life and death situations on an extreme basis, but we struggle every day to pay for food, rent, bills, car payments, etc. We too suffer from PTSD and receive no sympathy, no concern, no thank yous, no recognition, no support. I have to wonder how any of these healthcare workers would feel if they too received none of the above - nor even pay for the extra time and effort expected to do their job. I, too would like to do my job with recognition, minimal long term stress, fair pay and benefits. Professional workers, across the board, not just healthcare workers deserve alot more support and recognition."
2020-05-16 22:11:19,"ER doc here-
The shows of support are welcomed, and the consideration of our mental health also welcomed.
It’s needed in this hard time- 
I feel however, and I think many  of us do- that long term real change and support could be affected in other ways. Here are examples-

1) remove the constant threat of malpractice. Let us act and think like doctors- not checkboxes, or customer service reps-
At the very least- malpractice should be determined by doctors and informed medical personnel. Not a “jury of my peers”- not a one of whom will be a physician. Ask any lawyer.

2) remove the crushing burden of debt. I graduated owing 200,000 and am still paying it off 15 years into practice- and I was one of the 
lucky ones who paid for the first year of med school from savings from my EMT days.

3) physicians outside of the ER, and ironically, psychiatrists- could do much, much more to keep their patients out of the ER- emergencies happen after 4pm, usually on a Friday. Do your jobs and let us do ours.

I don’t mean to dismiss the toll that Covid has taken- particularly in NYC. My colleagues there have done the unthinkable-and are a credit to our specialty. Unbelievable work. We are ALL incredibly proud.
However- it’s this exact type of (relatively acute) situation that we are trained to handle and thrive in.

It’s the long term stresses and lack of support- see the above list- that grind us down, make us quit, and sadly, occasionally, lead many of us to consider suicide."
2020-05-16 22:15:04,"Sorry to say, but foresaw this outcome and advocates for critical incident stress management (CISM) measures to be planned, instituted, and activated on the broadest scale many weeks ago.

It’s long-past time that med-surg healthcare providers, their administrators/employers, and public health officials at all levels take mental health care and the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and professional social work seriously, and not just for their own patients, but for their own selves and souls as well."
2020-05-16 22:25:35,"COVID-19 is just a superimposing factor for already “on the verge “ health care workers’ mental health. To much stress to handle on daily basis.

2020-05-16 22:33:16,"From experience and PTSD training. There are different types of trauma from war experiences to abuse to rape. Some reasons are from one event and others cumulative. Moral injury added to PTSD is particularly relevant to war time events. Survivor guilt is a major factor or thinking you could have done more to prevent injury to others even if no death is involved. Secondary trauma can happen when your awful experience is not recognized by others as significant. 

I hope these workers receive a lot of educational materials on common responses to a potentially traumatic event or ongoing situation in order to normalize symptoms such as nightmares and hyper vigilance. Many people will have temporary symptoms and some will need more help and treatment. Not everyone agrees on what the best treatment plan is and some work for one and not for others. VA has learned a lot and there are good research studies."

That is part of the root of some of the Fear. No protection in this Covid war in A Warrior culture.  It is inhumane. 

 Jobs in health care right now are highly stressful enough but when left without protection that is terrifying and russian roullette.   It has to be a big part of the PTSD.   Justifiable anger, rage, lack of respect, resentments and poor treatment due to lack of PPE is not even close to a healthy foundation to work from.   Especially now during COVID, when some medical conditions are compared to a combat zone.  Lack of PPE must be on their minds 24/ 7, then add in the one and one care for the dying and 12 plus shifts, it is overload on the nervous system.

  The emotional toll would be a bit less and more manageable with the proper PPE per Patient and necessary armor.  It is too much to bear to be without.

The respiratory therapists, janitorial services, nurses, food services -- were each a huge part in taking care of the patients. It was strange caring for a disease we didn't know what to make off and which might harm ourselves, but we tried. We're getting better at it. We definitely lost some people that could have been saved. Have dreamt of COVID for about 48/50 of the last nights. People seem to care but the government spends so much $$$ so large corporations get bailouts, the PPP has rampant abuse (when is the NYT going to investigate that?!?!) - while hospital workers still lack consistently effective PPE. The meals are nice, but would  treasure a society that and reimbursement system that does not reward ""more medicine"" versus ""good medicine"" that forces us to document less and insures people have health care irrespective of their employment status. 

Oh and while I'm at it -- I would love for the family of the 95yr demented person on a COVID vent to understand that they won't make it and that placing a feeding tube and breathing tube in their stomach won't help -- and that it unnecessarily exposes health care workers to COVID and takes resources and time and energy from the 40yo also on a COVID vent -- but no, it won't change -- nothing will ever change. We just have to sit and take it."

2020-05-16 22:56:28,I have never deeply thought about the mental issues nurses would experience during the pandemic right now. I have been thinking about what would it be like if I am one of those nurses who work to help coronavirus patients. Nurses would see patients die due to coronavirus every day with their eye right next to them. What about the family weeping as their family member pass away? Nurses are experiencing those tragedies and are never getting any help. Now I noticed that seeing others die and mourns of the family can cause depression and suicidal thoughts. I can not do anything but hope that the nurses would keep up what they are doing. I want to thank them for their work.

2020-05-16 22:58:55,"As a clinical therapist and school psychologist I can only speak for myself. What skills I have - and many of my professional peers - is available free for the asking to folks on the front line of Covid-19.  Talking to a therapist is not ""asking for help.""  It is seeking community with professionals who are trained to listen. Really listen, fully, to your experience and what it has done to you inside and out, without judgement.  Occasionally at work, I do listen in awe of the strength and vulnerability of people, and how important they each are."
2020-05-16 23:06:51,"As selfless and dedicated as the front-line healthcare workers have been, it is fair to ask whether and how long they will continue risking their health and the health of their families so that people can belly up to the bar and tie one on."

There is incredible peer support, there is singing’ Dancing’ and celebrations for the many  recovered and discharged Covid patients.   
Many hospitals are working very hard to make sure that their employees access their employee assistance programs and other mental health resources.   I worry more for the general community who are living in difficult situations with no money for rent or food, etc. I worry for those who have lost family members and could not properly grieve or say good bye. I worry we will see more suicides in the general population.   There is tremendous grief and loss right now. Everyone needs access to mental health services."

2020-05-16 23:39:31,"I truly, truly feel for these people with courage beyond human endurance.  But there is something that needs to be considered.  I’m not saying it is a forgotten matter, but:   In the demographic bearing the brunt of the current 87K fatalities, 65+ age, most were in nursing homes. But there are millions of us not in such places having comorbidities that become lethal if exposed to Covid-19.  To date and being a member of that demographic, the only public policy I’m aware of is solitary confinement. I can manage comorbidities for only so long with telemed.  At some point, CT scan imaging, blood work, actual physical examination for cancer monitoring, joint replacement X-Rays all will have to be done in person.  I can’t find masks in any of the places I feel “safe” entering.  Left with just bandannas and coffee filters, I might as well walk into an unmarked IED field.  If this isn’t identified soon as a secondary health crisis by state departments of public health, the Republican in the Oval Office’s Death Clock will just keep spinning around with the tragic and unnecessary death of these people. Those state-by-state linear/bar graphs hence forth will ID the winners and the losers.  Or are we just that expendable?"
2020-05-16 23:52:13,"Now that things are starting to quiet down...the feelings are settling in. I'm realizing, maybe speaking with a therapist would be a good idea.
During the surge, I didn't have time to ""feel"", or process our emotions. I was simply surviving each shift, doing the best I could, which never seemed enough. Once home, I collapsed from exhaustion. Still, sleep was impossible, way too many thoughts swirling around, until the alarm would go off and the day began with another ferocious, stress headache. 
Now that things are starting to quiet down...I keep reliving it all. I am obsessed with a thought-- with the floors filled with ""COVID positive"" and ""COVID rule-outs"", what if those ""rule-outs"" were indeed negative? What if we gave them COVID because we didn't have enough PPE and we had to wear the same PPE for all patients? The guilt is overwhelming. 
We did the best we could, with what we had.

                               I witnessed lots of violence and injuries and injustices,but tried to fight it,and right the wrongs.I was targeted by the MBA administration.I wore a roadrunner pin.Then one early Sunday morning during an overwhelming med pass,I was sexually assaulted in a blocked hallway.The head administrator's comment was ""It's part of her job"".Well my reality fell apart.The tough union leader.I was diagnosed with PTSD.My husband and 2 adult sons begged me to leave.I finally did 2 years later.My heart breaks for these healthcare workers.Advise I have,get a therapist,get outside for walks.Enjoy the stars,the birds,the trees,the flowers,the clouds.You have done your best.You will heal.I did."
2020-05-17 00:18:48,"I am sure that one of the many things that weighs on these providers from the busiest epicenter hospitals is the knowledge that some or even many of the patients did die just because things were so out of control.

As important as they are, it's the medical professionals who are there for those living (and dying) with covid who are critical right now.

2020-05-17 00:39:13,"As a former NYC intensive care nurse and later hospice nurse, I know well that there are things that you just can’t “un-see.”  It’s almost impossible to find the words to thank nurses, aides and docs what they’re going through. The biggest thank you would be if people continue to practice physical distancing and hunkering down at home, preventing the spread. There’s nothing worse than having a full-house of sick people with beds in the corridors separated by a mere paper trifold paper screen serving as a barrier between your patients and every and passerby. I eventually had to leave the profession so as to put this Humpty Dumpty together again.  My hope is that we as a society stops turning a blind eye to the cause and effect impacting healthcare.  We live in fast Times.  Everything is accelerated.  Nursing and doctoring is different now.  I think that universities and medical institutions need to recalibrate expectations and educate or manage, respectively those who aspire to or do work in these professions.  These institutions can start by thinking through and implementing some amazing care for the caregivers. Until then, the biggest thank you would be if people continue to practice physical distancing and continue to hunker down until we are in the clear- whether via vaccine or otherwise. It is likely not going to be the last pandemic.  As a society we all need to do our part in restructuring how we live such that we create a better post pandemic world."

The media tried their best to convey the enormous emotional stress and pure panic these warriors were experiencing. But shell-shocked Drs, nurses technicians treating sick and dying covid patients were often too numb, too exhausted to admit the enormous toll this pandemic was wreaking on their body, mind and soul.

For the most part, they suffered in silence while the rest of us were safe in our homes, not wanting to think about what they were going through, for even 5 minutes much less for 12 hour shifts.  

And the worst part is that this despicable man who calls himself ""president"" never speaks of these heroes...of their bravery  or courage. And he never mentions the tragic loss of life suffered by this group of frontline medical workers as they worked feverishly to contain the virus.  Trump only praises himself and his ""team"" for what he daily calls a ""great job"".   

In fact this low life actually accused drs and nurses of stealing PPE's ""out the back door"" when they exposed the truth and complained of PPE shortages.  

Now Trump and his team are trying desperately to re-write history and assign blame to everyone else for his disastrous and deadly response to Covid-19. 

This time it won't work. 
The Drs, Nurses, EMT's will not allow it.
Neither will 90,000+ departed souls."

1) it didn't have to be this bad in the U.S.: Trump et al. 

The ignorance and the lying, the denying and the covering up. 
The not reading or caring about the Daily Briefing, which said no fewer than 6 times(!), in January! that this was coming and the nation needed to prepare. 

And: It didn't have to be the bad in NY (Cuomo, DeBlasio).

I write this with heavy heart and true empathy, knowing all too well the long-term damage and lifelong cost to self and soul for these types of enormous political and institutional failures.

My heart has bled for NY from day one, for their immense suffering yet again, for those who succumbed and those who cared for them, the families and their valiant healthcare caregivers.  

It will take a long while to find any type of equilibrium again.   Things will fade, be 'pushed down,' only to pop up again at the most unexpected time.

2020-05-16 22:46:31,"""Post"" Traumatic Stress Disorder
Post: after
Traumatic: emotionally disturbing or distressing.
Stress: a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.
Disorder: a state of confusion.

After experiencing an emotionally disturbing or distressing event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry or nervous rendering you confused.

Being ""after"" means that the events causing the frustrated, angry or nervous feelings, it means that they are stored, still held within you. ""One"" method to see this is to measure the physical, biochemical, changes in our body.

The resolve to PTSD is to process through, not the knowing of the event but through the emotions of the stored memories and feelings bringing resolve.  

While it is true that a single event can cause PTSD, in many cases it is a series of events, that for various reasons, a person is either unable or unwilling to process, to feel through.  The stored emotions are like radiation, they are accumulative and at a certain point, the body is unable to cope with the present.  

It is like a multitude of televisions, each individual television playing one of the traumatic events, but all playing them at the same time.  Each one looped, playing the traumas over and over with the waves of feelings overwhelming the body.

PTSD is like being in a constant state of feeling unsafe, people put up a barrier and don't let others in.  Feeling safe heals"

 We see things daily that other people might see once in a lifetime.  Over dinner friends would talk about how many emails they had to catch up on, I would inadvertently silence the room by talking about ribs breaking under my hands during CPR or someone bleeding out in front of me - as they described their day, so I matter of factly described mine.  I've since stopped doing that.   I see a therapist every week for nearly 10 years now.  Without this  work with a great therapist, in a safe space surely would have ended my life.

At the risk of being somewhat redundant in commenting on the salve that may help with your pain, trauma and ptsd symptoms there is a time tested best practice intervention. EMDR which can be readily applied and is a very effective intervention for trauma-based symptoms.

2020-05-17 02:19:00,"Great article and great pictures. I can relate to this story deeply being an ICU nurse in the Netherlands. What I find particularly hard to deal with is the plain notion that we're quite powerless in treating the critically ill covid patients. They can go from moderately sick to 'close to death' within hours to a day. One moment I or relatives (zoom) are still talking to the conscious and scared patient, the next moment the patient is intubated, has low blood pressure, the lab values are all over the place, sedation levels need to be too high to be healthy....
One might make it over time, but the treatment is rough on the patients and we know we are not just helping them, but also putting them in jeopardy.
It' s all very cruel. And there have been too many of them patients for health care workers to not be affected. We the nurses are told not to sound optimistic when talking to relatives on the phone. That alone is something that impacts us.
We do laugh a lot and there is a sense of 'we're all in this boat together' which definitely helps. But anyone who denies being  in some way affected, I'm not so sure about that."
2020-05-17 03:26:50,"Our medical system is beyond broken — and this pandemic has exposed all of the layers of dysfunction and abuse we physicians and our patients have been enduring from insurance companies, hospital administrators, and greedy pharma.  Enough is Enough, we can’t allow this to continue!  

I do not mean to sound ungrateful for all of the gratitude that society is expressing towards healthcare workers, it certainly is more than what we hear from hospital executives who view us as cogs in a wheel.  

However, what we need is ACTION rather than cheers.  I implore the public to fight with healthcare workers to take back our medical systems that puts the PATIENT FIRST, rather than systems that are driven by money for the hospital executives and shiny new hospital buildings.   We need physicians to unionize and fight back for our autonomy so we can practice medicine in the patients’ best interests (not for the bottom line)."
2020-05-17 08:55:46,"My son is a Clinical Psychologist. He works in a hospital which is a regional centre for Covid-19 patients. It is by no means under pressure from the number of covid-19 patients, beds are available. PPE could be better but is adequate.

However, he & his colleagues in Psychology/Psychiatry are having staff treating those patients referred to them. He describes the experience as humbling. He finds it difficult, to the point of impossibility, to imagine how staff dealing with high numbers of Covid-19 patients can cope.

I suggested to him that when being swamped with numbers staff are very much focused on the tasks before them. It was a thought he had had himself. We can both see the implications of this.

I've been fortunate to have had serious illnesses, one of which could have killed me, expertly treated. Recently I've been wondering how all those surgeons, physicians & nurses have been doing. I hope they are all safe."
2020-05-17 12:39:23,"Good to see recognition of mental disorders among physicians. 

They seem to take it out on patients.  I've gone to the ER for an urgent medical problem only to be met with a physician who mistakenly  assumed I was coming to the ER for attention, anxiety, or hysteria. All which didn't exist--except in the mind of the physician. This happened more than once; and then I was left with permanent damage from not getting the issues addressed in a timely manner. I am now fearful of going to a hospital as they do not feel like safe places to me.

Perhaps mental health treatment for medical workers will improve patient safety as physicians will then see it's all in THEIR heads, not ours."
2020-05-17 12:42:51,All health care workers are doing a dangerous and sometimes not a very rewarding job!  They know that when they train and prepare themselves for this work.  It can be a mental challenge and they deserve all the support which can be provided to them.  For some dealing with a large number of patients can be better than dealing with a few.  It keeps them from becoming personally involved with the few.  All hospitals should have Psychologists and Psychiatrists on their staff to help these health care workers deal with their issues-not just because of this current crisis but at all times.

I even held up a little nurses uniform, that as a 4 year old, my mother had sewn for me because even then, I wanted to be a nurse!  And during my speech, my youngest daughter, only 8, sat there listening to her mom - and now she has served years as an ER nurse - even in New York and all across America.  

This year - no nursing school graduations because of a horrific pandemic that has torn healthcare workers lives.  It’s not even safe for a graduation, a congratulatory service to send new grads on their way.  A time to wish them well in the best profession ever. 

But I say to you, my nurse comrades, the angels of mercy, today’s heroes:  I have never, ever been more proud of you. You are the threshold that keeps this country together.  You are the most unselfish and model human beings on this earth.  You are the smartest, most gentle, insightful species of what this world needs most.

Many give up time with their children and go to work knowing their kids may lose them. I really appreciate this article and it hits close to home as my family includes many doctors including my husband.
 
One big piece missing in this article is the insurance company stressor. The insurance companies are still making record profits while squeezing doctors paychecks. Many doctors are being asked to take on these risks and reduce their salaries, work longer hours, or see more patients then ever before. All the while, they may be paying rent to live apart from their families. Telemedicine visits are being reimbursed at lower rates and layoffs are rampant as a result despite the need for resources to treat Covid 19 patients. This is a travesty. I would like to see more articles on this aspect of the life for health care workers so that the public is more aware of things they can do (i.e. vote) to help healthcare workers."

Words like hero dehumanizes health care workers. They are not supermen. Ignorantly referring to them as warriors debases the very foundation of American democracy. We don't have a nation with a warrior class.

These mindless words make human beings expendable. 

No one signed up to join a death cult, and yet the United States has a cult leader worse than Jim Jones at the helm, promoting his golf course while thousands guzzle his Chloroquine Kool-Aid

War planes fly over the epicenter of the pandemic, New York City, as a perverse consolation to doctors and nurses. Never mind that New Yorkers are still experiencing the trauma of planes flying into buildings.

2020-05-17 05:11:06,"I’ve been a practicing surgeon for 25 years, and the deterioration in morale among physicians and nurses is by far the worse I’ve witnessed before, and predates the present crisis. Hospital administrators and insurance companies are the chief culprit. You want to know why more docs appear cynical, greedy, and distant? Probably because it reflects the society we come from. It beats the niceness out of you."
2020-05-17 09:17:13,"Para medic's are part of the warrier culture, the caring part. they are willing to risk their lives to help save the lives of others. Many times they choose to go out unarmed themselves due to personal convictions or so they can carry extra medical gear.  In civilian life the individual are not as hardened to the trauma they see on a regular basis and being human they break down, sometimes it is temporary and talking it out and rest are all they need to return to the wards, sum times it is so traumatic for so long that they snap, and really are not capable of going back to the grind.  After this pandemic is controlled I foresee many of the best and brightest  practitioners leaving the medical field due to stress and burnout.  This will exacerbate the lack of good trained medical professionals we currently desperitily need in many areas of the country."
2020-05-17 12:19:01,"I am a surgeon and have been through The HIV, hepatitis C and resistant bacteria evolution and various upper respiratory threats to health (SAR, H1N1). Never have I seen such a personal threat as COVID-19. To the people who are holding the hands of the dying I give my greatest respect.

The experience of being on a trauma team for 20 years has changed me indelibly. Each tragedy takes a small piece of you or leaves a small scar. You see and experience life like few others can. Its like you’re born with empty sand bags and each tragedy is like someone placing a teaspoon in one bag. Eventually the bags get full and you can hardly move.

Attempting to appreciate people enduring this is understood. The problem is it doesn’t alleviate their burden. These people are struggling with debt, small children at home,their own loss of loved ones and still selflessly follow a calling to stem the tide if this tragedy. 

Some of us go to work in these conditions only go to the store and see people with no mask or having a party or showing up at a legislative house with a gun! We see more slaps in the face each day then real support. If you want to support your hero’s, give them a nod by staying home, cover your face in public, wash your hands. Be informed. Act and vote responsibly to honor the people putting their lives on the line for you."
2020-05-17 12:28:08,"The people who really need recognition, and thankfully are starting to be seen are all of the security guards standing at the door, the liaisons and front desk people talking to the patients and families, the housekeepers (who generally are the kindest most gentle people you’ve known), the hospital engineers, the food service people who keep the staff and patients fed, the transporters, nurses aides, phlebotomy teams and anyone else who touches the patient experience directly. You are not forgotten in this epidemic. These are the people who do what is asked of them, keeping the hospital’s ability to heal alive."
2020-05-17 03:06:40,"Multiple times in the article there are mentions of free care being provided for mental health treatment.  i wonder if those hospitals and healthcare professionals who treat their employees and colleagues who have been infected are being expected to provide the care for free and don't bill insurance for it.
Most hospitals already shortchange mental health care as it isn't a big money maker like surgery or specialties like radiology and cardiology performing expensive tests.  Now they expect those who provide that care to provide it for free.
Of coursse, as we know, if you die from suicide tor disabled by mental illness that is your life is worth less than someone who has cancer or heart disease."
2020-05-16 04:00:09,"As most shoppers have learned, an established retailer (J.C. Penney, for example) never really goes ""out of business."" Someone just comes along and buys it out of bankruptcy and, unless the buyer is a competitor already in the market, just opens it up under the old name (the name being one of the assets that the buyer will have purchased). Shoppers rarely know the difference, and the buyer wants it that way. Creditors of the old retailer, who will get partially or entirely stiffed, may have a much different view, but most shoppers couldn't care less."
2020-05-16 04:09:16,"The brand’s middle class associations now struggling with the disappearance of the middle class.  This was its best hope of resolving the issues with its creditors.  But it’s a sad day.  

Thank you for the balanced article and photos, particularly viewing the issue through the lens of the brand’s value to the malls.  The sight of yawning retail space across a cracked and yawning asphalt sea is disheartening.  When JC Penney closes stores, this slow creep of the demise of malls will be accelerated. It’s a sad day, to be sure."
2020-05-16 04:20:08,"KMart went out of business years ago, but is still in business.  Why my fellow progressives are bemoaning the bankruptcies of large conglomerate department retailers is interesting.  They generally pay minimum wage (some could argue less considering the apparel requirements), workers have no representation, and they sell products with complete disregard to the environmental and labor standards under which they are produced.  Add to that the billions of acres covered by parking lots instead of green nature.  Good riddens.  Lets instead produce jobs that are good for communities, families, and the environment."
2020-05-16 04:29:57,I grew up in J C Penney’s hometown and graduated from Penney High School. JC owned a large farm just east of town that raised prize Black Angus cattle. He would occasionally come back to visit and I remember him driving his Cadillac down main street. My dad was a merchant and he and several of the other business owners would join Mr. Penney for coffee. Mr. Penney never once picked up the check...
2020-05-16 04:42:47,"The name that doesn't come up in this article is Kohl's. Kohl's seems to have taken over the market niche formerly occupied by Penney's and Sears. Is that because Penney's and Sears are in malls, which have been struggling for years, while Kohl's is in strip malls, which seem to do OK?  Imagine how much bigger that divide is going to be as people adjust to shopping in a world where COVID is an ongoing risk. Although anchor stores have the benefit of exterior entrances and curbside pickup possibilities, I wonder if the mall business model is about to go the way of Souplantation."
2020-05-16 05:14:39,"Sad. I grew up in the aftermath of the Great Depression. While I have not shopped much in Penney's in recent years (at my age, I don't show much anywhere) but it was a mainstay for my family as I was growing up in a small town in PA.
Along with the pandemic, it definitely feels like the end of an era."
2020-05-16 05:29:53,"This is terrible and depressing news. I grew up in the 60's and 70's. We got our mall in 1974, the original anchors were Macy's and Sears. Later came JC Penney. Now two of those anchors are in bankruptcy. This is not good at all. My dad passed away in 1982, my mom got her first job after being a stay at home mom for 20 years at Macy's. They actually gave her health benefits. She later left Macy's for a job in the NYC school system but we all loved shopping at Macy's for years and spent a lot of time in the mall as a teen and young adult. All of these stores are now in trouble. Even though these are considered to be low paid retail jobs they are better than being an Amazon warehouse worker. The workers also get a work discount or they did when my mom worked there in the eighties."

2020-05-16 05:49:36,"One aspect of JCP I've disliked for decades is the emphasis on sales to sell merchandise. Several generations of people were trained to only buy stuff on sale there, which is a big reason why Ron Johnson failed when he tried to pivot to an everyday low pricing model: suddenly customers felt that they could no longer get a good deal. I preferred the everyday low pricing, but apparently I was in the minority. Though it worked for Walmart."
2020-05-16 06:24:49,This was sad to hear .  I purchased most of my cloths from a brick and mortar store of JCPenny.     I hope i can still purchase the cloths on line.  If not we will all be wearing bed sheets or togas if there are no more stores left to sell clothes in.   I am glad i got to enjoy the malls and department stores in my lifetime.  The younger generations will just have to shop on line and that is no fun.
2020-05-16 06:27:56,"While I shopped Penney's late in life Sears Roebuck was my childhood's best memory of shopping.  It sold candy in insane variety, furniture, tractors, scooters, guns, unbelievable  inventory.   Cannot think of anything they didn't try, even steel homes!  Today's business climate is too dishonest, too contrived for my tastes."
2020-05-16 06:32:30,"These retailers went down because they weren’t able to make the changes that dictated the new millennium. They did too little, too late.

It is sad because these stores were once present in remote areas of the country. As some commentators mentioned, they were part of a culture. Going to the mall go get lunch and walk around the store, picking up a gift to a friend, was a Saturday activity that we looked forward to. It was when we were allowed to eat a burger at the food court and check out the toys we would ask Santa for Christmas.

We are witnessing the marginalization of many regions. Stores leave and jobs leave—people will need to leave to survive. This will ultimately lead to less investment and poor infrastructure of these remote areas. 

I’m hoping that as a result small local businesses will make a come back. But I can’t help but wonder if customers thirst for convenient, cheap thrills of online shopping will allow these small businesses to actually thrive."
2020-05-16 07:06:52,Kurt Vonnegut expressed his contempt of the shopping mall people where bored folks hang out; to get out of the house. The Last Picture Show depicted the same look back in anger about our lost youth. The department store (museums) seem  somewhat irrelevant. People do not have time to shop for more stuff; only to get deeper in debt. Time to rip-up the store card?
2020-05-16 07:22:56,"JCP has been floundering for ages. One new set of executives after another trying to battle the dying retail model, their perception as inexpensive and dowdy but not cheap enough (like Walmart) and numerous debt issues that they could never overcome. This is far from unexpected."
2020-05-16 08:51:23,"The last time I visited the United States (NY City in 2018) I was quite shocked to see how old fashioned stores like JC Penney and Kmart were. I remember JC Penney being severely overstocked, it was quite dark in there with low ceilings. Very uninviting. Kmart looked like I had taken a time machine to the 1980's. Shocking that they managed to survive in a brutal retail environment like New York City for so long. I heard that they have now closed that store. 

JC Penney's problem is that they don't have an identity, they don't give the people a reason there to shop except a voucher. But a voucher is the worst reason people should stop there. Your brand should be loved SO much that regardless of the price, people will come to you anyway (see Apple Stores for example). JCP knows what they aren't, like Mrs. Kahn said in the article, but they don't know what they are. And for 20 years that has been the reason of declining sales and a deferred bankruptcy, the corona crisis has only sped up its demise and should not be seen as the root cause of it."
2020-05-16 09:20:31,"J.C. Penney is Bankrupt. No big surprise here. Just like J. Crew and Neiman Marcus they were going to go Bankrupt anyway. The Coronavirus Pandemic just hastened things by probably less than a year. The retail Industry has been it's own worst enemy for years. Oversaturation has reduced per store profits. Expensive Malls have vastly increased overhead. Hype oriented marketing (BOGO, 40% OFF, )ne Day sales that last 2 days) has trained people to almost never pay full price. Throw in online retailers and a contraction of the Retail Industry was inevitable."
2020-05-16 09:54:04,"They were long overdue. The last time I shopped at JC Penney I spent most of the time trying to locate a salesclerk or an open register. They just didn't have the finger on the pulse of the market anymore. Things got cheaper, first in price, then in quality, last in service. JC Penny's management failed to step into the 21st century. 

The coronavirus will get the blame, but we know better."
2020-05-16 10:04:10,"The thrill is gone. Although for me, back in the heyday of malls and retail giants, the main thrill was the anticipation of going to the mall to get the latest edition of Mad Magazine not mindless consumerism."
2020-05-16 10:09:21,"Sears and Roebuck, Montgomery Ward, now J.C, Penney.  All were mainstays of my former America.  It is sad to see them gone but not nearly surprising.  The retail world is collapsing along with the rest of the national economy as our capitalist market system eats itself alive.   It is hard to know how discount chains will survive in our trade wars with the suppliers of cheap goods.  The economic and political leadership have abandoned America.  The wealthy  pay no taxes.  They don't even live here; most of them.  They take half of the money we produce, and they walk away from their responsibilities to support the society that allowed them to create their wealth.  WE are not becoming a second class country.  We are one, slipping toward third at a rapid pace.  Donald Trump is President.  Imagine that."
2020-05-16 10:31:15,"This breaks my heart.  I have shopped at J.C. Penny's for as long as I can remember.  It was always a great store to buy some of my new ""school clothes"" every year when I was a teacher and I bought a lot of my jeans and other knock around clothes there, too. It is really sad to see many of the old, established stores dying off and I guess that is going to really escalate now during this pandemic."
2020-05-16 10:38:24,"As with Sears, it's been really painful to watch J.C. Penney go into what could likely be a death spiral.

And as another reader mentioned, Sears, Montgomery Ward, & J.C. Penney were all mainstays. They were working-class stores (not department stores per se), but unlike Wal-Mart, had nice merchandise that was a  good value for the money. Montgomery Ward fell victim to a changing climate 20 years ago.

Personally, I think the beginning of the end was when the stores dropped their big catalogs by the early '90s. (You can't blame the internet for that, as it hadn't even taken off yet.) And then in the 2000s, Sears & Penney were infiltrated with MBAs & private equity--guaranteed to kill off even the most robust business model. Remember just a few years ago when Penney had added appliances back to their stores in a bid to hopefully outlive Sears? That idea was nixed overnight, as it became more & more obvious of just how desperate things were getting pre-virus.

What's a shame is that there really won't be anything to fill these niches. Small businesses can't/won't do it (which is why downtown districts were stunted by the '70s), & the internet is an incomplete answer. Based on how things are unwinding, I don't think the discount chains like Wal-Mart should get too confident--the sun is setting on that business model too ..."
2020-05-16 10:46:05,"Another store chain that could not position itself in the marketplace. Not the virus’s fault. They sold Liz Claiborne clothes but hardly anyone knew it. 
Likewise with Sears. Positioning is one of the P’s in marketing. They had Lands End products. 
The teenagers now are not brand loyal. They flip quickly from brand to brand, store to store."
2020-05-16 10:47:35,"Among other reasons, part of the problem is the staggering amount of per capita retail space in the USA compared to many other countries. 23.5 sq ft per person in the USA compared to countries like the UK (at 4.6) and Germany (at 2.3). The two closest were Canada and Australia (at 16.8 and 11.2 respectively). From statista.com"
2020-05-16 10:49:09,Another anchor store that will no longer be at any mall. This does not surprise me as the one in my local mall was pretty empty most of the time. I think this big retailers are going to be a thing of the past and are going to be replaced by smaller more specialized stores.
2020-05-16 10:54:57,"These companies could go back to the old days when there was a catalog, had their own trucks to deliver them, etc etc. Sort of like the old Sears and Roebuck days of the 50's but with better wages and safety measures."
2020-05-16 11:03:48,"On my trips back to the States, I would always make a J.C. Penney excursion to stock up on their store-brand underwear—T-shirts, boxers, etc.—which was relatively inexpensive and good enough quality to last; after 15-20 years I have things that are still wearable. But the actual shopping experience was always depressing and I remember that there were never very many customers in the various Penneys I went to. As noted here in other comments, there was never a salesperson on the floor, and even with the lack of customers there was always a long wait at the cash register, which was usually manned (or womanned) by a very unhappy-looking person. I would get in and out as fast as I could, never a real shopping “experience”. I'm surprised that they lasted as long as they did…"
2020-05-16 11:06:21,"When I look at pictures of people  from the 50s up till the early 1980s, people dressed nicely.  No logos, and clothes tended to be made better, withe better material. 

The decline of quality clothing came at the same time as the rise of the mall.  Mall culture arouse in the 1980s as a generation of teens, the children of the Boomers, needed somewhere to go.  The main-street shops were put out of business. It was these little shops that had tailors and seamstresses that did the ordering of merchandise and custome fitting (if need be).  

I remember their faded shops in the late 80s, as that generation was dying out.  My parents would take me to the mall for clothing.  As I was a young boy and would wear out my clothes quickly. My mom would go to the little shops and find some nicer, better made, better styled things, that the seamstress would alter."
2020-05-16 11:09:32,"I used to work for JCPenney when they had their headquarters in NYC. Employees were treated with respect and we could even go in for free to the Museum of Modern Art across the street since the company had a corporate membership. The company wanted the best in everything and money was not an objection. Then the corporation decided to downsize, sold its two skyscrapers and moved to Texas. That was the start of its decline. This is the result of greed: it destroys everything. If it had kept its two skyscrapers in NYC, they could've sold them for much more that they did at the end of the 1980s."
2020-05-16 11:10:06,"I don’t see the resurrection of JC Penney from this Chapter 11 ‘one foot in the grave’ moment. This chain as a tried and true and attractive brand as a destination is virtually defunct. The private equity guys came along 19 years ago with a real estate and retooling/repositioning plan that failed miserably. The retailer had been on life support for decades since the 1980s. Its core customer base is aged out and spent out. JC Penney is wedged between high end department stores which are also hurting and discounters which are more profitable, popular and nimble. Kohl’s, among other smaller types, competes in its space without the overhang of staff, real estate, brand and debt legacy. The mall itself is no longer the go-to youth and family destination with online shopping and COVID19 among other factors."
2020-05-16 11:11:36,"All these department stores are obsolete for at least 20 years. And that has nothing to do with the Internet or Amazon.

Once or twice a year I make it into one of them and I always come back to the same conclusion. Before you even find the stuff you are looking for, you are tired of it all and then it takes another 5 minutes to find the exit again."
2020-05-16 11:12:25,"As a senior citizen, I have witnessed big changes on how Americans shop such as internet and the establishment of Walmarts everywhere.  More importantly, I have witnessed the quality of our products in large retailers diminished to being a waste of money, lack of choices etc. 

It is no wonder that these entities close.  

JC Penny, Sears, Lands End, LLBean, etc have all lowered their quality to the extent of being unreliable.  

Furniture feels as if it is all ""assembly"", particle board etc or beyond one's budget for ""real"" furniture.  

Quality is lacking everywhere, or is beyond one's reach with present budgets. America has become what feels like a throw-away society. Quality products are difficult to find. Along with questionable marketing tactics, who wants to chance their hard earned money on cheap product."
2020-05-16 11:14:36,"It's sad to see major companies shut down and so many people lose their jobs. But on the other hand, I've never shopped there as an adult. I'm nearly 40. Last time I entered (probably several years ago) I recall feeling lost among aisles and aisles of stuff I wasn't interested in. Clearly I wasn't the only one."
2020-05-16 11:18:11,"Let’s be totally clear here.  Guys like Bill Ackman and Eddie Lampert, just time name a few, do not care about retailers or any business they get involved in. 

They care about money. 

They use every angle possible to enrich themselves while driving the business into the ground, cutting their workforce and fattening their debt load. 

This savior/raider capitalism has been going on for years now and is taught in every top business school in this country. 


Another example of the rich wringing the system dry at the expense of everyone but themselves."

And for those who eschew buying clothes formerly worn by others, there is always the option of getting a sewing machine, picking up some reusable (always) patterns and learning how to tailor one's own clothes from an online tutorial.  We'll all enjoy so much down time with the way things look...."
2020-05-16 11:28:15,I used to shop there but I noticed a change a few years back that I did not like. So I stopped shopping there. I think it has more to do with simple poor management from the very top. The times they are a changing.
2020-05-16 11:29:53,"They were dead long before the virus hit. Amazon,Walmart and online shopping in general is killing major retailers. In this online age of shopping. You adapt or perish.

2020-05-16 11:34:57,The store at Garden State Plaza in New Jersey did well I believe but then the mall owners decided that the store wasn’t “ upscale” enough  so they didn’t renew their lease.
2020-05-16 11:42:42,"Actually, as I recall, the 4 “P”s of Marketing are Product, Price, Promotion and Place(distribution). 
I think “positioning” would fall under pricing strategy...
As to JC Penney’s bankruptcy, that’s just another mile marker in retail - how many chains have come and gone? And how many times do they restructure, consolidate, etc, before they give up. 
I think the longevity of the mall and anchor stores as a useful retail model is sustained by American consumer culture. We shop as a primary avocation and so need places to go to do that. As long as there are people willing to go and spend money there, the cycle of competition for those dollars will continue. 
It makes no sense to me, mind you. Amazon, eBay, Home Depot and a good supermarket are all I need. A trip to the mall or a department store sounds like torture to me."
2020-05-16 11:44:49,"Isn't in interesting that the retailers taken over by venture capitalists and hedge fund managers (Sears, JC Penney) seem to fail, while Kohl's continues to survive? Notice how both Sears and JC Penney were overloaded with debt once taken over, but Kohl's is on better financial footing to survive the pandemic?"
2020-05-16 11:47:24,"It doesn't take a genius to realize what is going on in this economy. 
Unfortunately, just another sign of the decimated middle class. The company will probably be bought out by a private equity company for pennies on the dollar, who will squeeze out any value left in the company, profits which will be funneled to wealthy private equity backers.
Those same backers will then funnel that wealth into Amazon stock, make more profits, while the workers laid off will be asked to be ""move with the economy"" and work for lower wages, and compete with sweat shop workers in China and other countries.
Classic conquest of capital, and worker abuse. While the average investor in the stock market lives under the mirage that they too can one day become rich if they A) either work hard enough or B) invest in the right stock, both of which are a dream since the 80s.
And if anyone even points this out, you're a communist or anarchist who hates freedom.
Honestly, it's high time we start addressing this, across both political parties, and realize this before it gets worse."

2020-05-16 12:13:43,It always saddens me to hear about these stores closing or going bankrupt.  My first job as a teenager was at a mall and I remember the “glory days” fondly.  I hardly go to the mall but the few times I have gone I always come out feeling sad.
2020-05-16 12:23:27,"The creative-destruction of dynamic capitalism cares nothing for corporate structures and in country with probably 30% too much retail space we are going to see many more reorganization and liquidations. Retail has attracted the vulture capitalists of late who have been ahead of and have promoted this decline.

Now what? Well there will be bankruptcies among malls and their owners which will also result in large write-offs for the banks. The nimble will survive by repurposing their properties. Simon here in Buckhead effectively closed a department store in one of its malls, pulled down the building and is building a mixed used complex. It will pull down another one (Lord & Taylor) and do the same.

For the rest who knows and then there is the surplus of office buildings, Developers, their investors and their banks are in trouble too."

2020-05-16 12:30:29,"I am an ardent capitalist but for the life of me cannot see the legal, moral or legitimate business reasoning behind allowing the buyer of a company to place the debt for the purchase on the target. The standard structure for the equity fund buy in of a business is to front a small amount of its own money along with a massive loan to purchase the firm. That loan is owed not by the investors at the equity fund but rather by the newly purchased company. This is exacerbated by additional loans that are taken in the same way. All the while, the equity firm is paying itself huge fees for setting up the deal, walking it through the process, refunding it’s original costs and regular payments for “management” of the purchase and operations of the company. This debt load is what causes a JC Penney, Toys-R-Us, etc to fail."

Penney's seemed to be ahead of the curve with mail order, 20 or 30 years ago, and seemed well poised to be a player when online shopping started becoming trendy.  But they blew it.  Somewhere along the way, the wheels fell off the bus.  

Ackman and Johnson then steered the bus right off a cliff."
2020-05-16 12:38:46,"This is a sad day.  J.C. Penney always treated their customers honorably.  When I was working at a store while an undergraduate, I remember my store manager telling me to make any large purchase from Sears, Montgomery Ward, or J.C. Penney because they would stand behind what they sell.  It was also slightly more upscale than the other two.  In the largest big city close to where we live, Penney is the only surviving department store, unless one counts Kohl's; five have closed in the last few years.  Their small town stores were a lifeline in many farming communities.

2020-05-16 12:43:43,"Whatever I could not find at Sears, I knew I would find it at J.C. Penney.  They always had nicer clothes for what I was looking for and their home section was fantastic.  I could always find the curtains, towels and kitchen accoutrements I needed.

What's left these days are places that either overcharge for junk quality or places that just carry junk quality.

When Marshall Fields was acquired by Macy's in 2005, all remaining hope was lost for the remaining reasonable, quality and the gold standard of department stores. 

I always thought of J.C. Penney as the store that could fit almost any budget but still carried exceptional product lines.

I realize that I am old, but I didn't think I was that old to see the passing of so many department stores that were around long before I was born.

Not only is this store closing another end of an era, it's also the closing door of many fond memories and shopping experiences.

Thank you to everyone who ever helped me locate or decide on the item I was searching for.  Your assistance was always so appreciated and needed."

2020-05-16 13:07:48,"I spent nearly 17 years of my life working for ""The Penney Company"".  I started selling electronics in my early 20s, and ultimately transitioned to a leadership role at one of the larger, more profitable stores in the chain during the 1990s.

While I am saddened by this news, I am not surprised.  I am saddened as I think of the many fine ""associates"" I had worked with over my 17 years with the company.   Saddened as I consider the brilliant, quick thinking store managers I had answered to.  And I am saddened to recognize that more than 30 years of valiant effort to remake themselves has ultimately fallen short.

I am no marketing major, economist, or any one of the many ""retailing experts"" who critique what failing retailers are doing wrong.  What I can say is that there was no shortage of effort on the part of leadership to remake the brand into something relevant and profitable, at least during my years with the organization.

So, while I am saddened, I am also reminded that we have ALL been here before.  Long gone are Pomeroy's, Gimble's, Bamberger's, Korvette's, WT Grant, Two Guys from Harrison, A & P, Grand Union, Food Fair...the list goes on and on.

The fact is, things change.  People's needs change.  Sometimes companies make poor decisions.  And sometimes it's a little (or a lot) of both.  I suspect in this case, it was a little of both. 

I also suspect that the names of the future retailers may change, but I am certain we will all be here again."

Last year Palais Royal, a local chain closed and the Sears was in the process of closing down when the virus shuttered the mall, if Penney's leaves that will only leave Macy's and Dillard's and Macy's is having it's own troubles.

Have a down comforter that's lasted over 10 winters and no signs of wear yet. The catalog department was good, too; if it wasn't in the store, someone would help you with ordering and free pickup at the store. But I could see the rot setting in at the edges 12-15 years ago. The stores became messy and disorganized; there were fewer associates on the sales floor; the quality of the merchandise became cheaper than cheap. I simply stopped shopping there for those reasons.

There's a market demand out there between the super-expensive and Walmart that wants good, durable quality at a reasonable price in their 'stuff' that is currently missing. But that doesn't fit the 'business plan' of the vulture capitalists."

Going forward, we're likely to see more support for ""shopping local"" as these small stores are better suited to accommodating small numbers of customers and offer quality merchandize at reasonable prices. I expect more malls to empty out and close down through the rest of this decade as shoppers adopt a model of both online and purchases - online for items you don't need to inspect or try on first, and local for those items you do."

They are usually well-staffed and stocked, too. The last time I was in a Penney's store, it was almost creepy for lack of staffing, customers, and even lighting good enough to see your way around. 

Another option for us is buying things secondhand at consignment shops, garage or estate sales, and from Craigslist. We have found many high quality items, some almost brand new, and for very low prices. It makes shopping an adventure and less expensive, and it is recycling at its finest, too."

2020-05-16 14:23:15,"Am I one of the only people with good memories of J. C. Penney?  The one I frequented was on the corner of Wilshire and Third St., on what is now the Santa Monica Promenade.  They had, to my mind, quality shirts and jeans at discounted prices.  But what made that store special for this single guy were the clerks, who I came to know, were always smiling, and let me know if a particular item was the wrong size or did not look so good on me.  I trusted their sensibilities to help guide my sartorial finds, some of which I still have.

In short, the people in addition to the prices, made that store, which was quite different from competitors such as  KMart in the Fairfax area.  Even my first credit card was from Penney because I wanted to establish a credit score without being tempted to run up a big tab.  Mission accomplished.  

When that Penney became a flagship Banana Republic, all of this was lost.  And when the rest of the Promenade replaced the J.J. Newberry, which had a popular lunch counter, and the F.W. Woolworth, which anchored the center of the Promenade, the Promenade lost what made it eclectic and special to become an outdoor mall of higher end chain stores.  Out went the fun; in came blandness and profits.  To Santa Monica's old J.C. Penney, I salute you!"

It was true when I (now an older person) was a teenager and thought of those companies as places where my mother and her friends shopped, not as places for me. I was willing to buy socks and underwear there, but nothing that people would actually see.

I think those retailers made a mistake in thinking that they had to capture the youth market. Penney's in particular started carrying cheap, youth-oriented fashions. The trouble was that youth don't go to Penney's, which they think of a ""mom and grandma"" store, so they alienated their core customers without attracting new customers.

I don't know who in their management didn't understand the concept of different stores for different ages. Teenagers grow up and enter the workforce and have children of their own, and they start looking for practical, simple clothes that fit well and last a long time.

But on the rare occasions when I go to malls, all I see are clothing stores carrying pretty much the same cheap-looking but high-priced clothes, along with a couple of electronics stores. Gone our the days when Southdale, the first enclosed shopping mall, was like a miniature downtown, with every conceivable kind of store, including a supermarket."

Bankruptcy will allow the elimination or reduction of pensions and benefits for thousands of employees but as per usual, those at the top have their golden parachutes and will not suffer.  This is a result of poor management but Amazon is a behemoth who has destroyed the livelihood and way of life for many people.  That said, they are not the villains, we are.  

As the middle class is slowly but steadily destroyed, continue celebrating cheap and convenient; perhaps the next job to be eliminated will be yours.  Careful what you wish for."

They failed to take a successful catalog business to e-commerce, failed to innovate within their category of full service general merchandise, etc.  Amazon’s success accelerated the decline and even drove many unsuccessful attempts to change the customer demographic to upscale like Nordstrom’s.  COVID19 crushed the cash flow.  If they survive, I hope they are not another zombie retailer like Sears/Kmart.  If there is no way to grow, then they should be allowed to die.  Kohl’s, Belks, Target and others have taken over this category with some success.  Amazon and Covid19 are not the cause, failure of leadership and execution are the cause."

I found myself spending the majority of my time either asking for directions or being asked for directions without a sales associate in sight.  The only intelligent part of the redesign belonged to the beauty chain Sephora which had a dedicated walk-in section at the entrance of the store with 3 dedicated sales associates.  The rest of the store, including both floors, was the Wild Wild West, and I had to even ask for directions to find the elevator."
2020-05-16 15:11:25,In retrospect all  they had to was to invest $ 200 million in Amazon years ago  and they would have ten billion now Many competitors see the writing in the wall and when they have cash do not invest in their competition to hedge their downfall. The same is true for Ford and GM in Tesla. If they had just put $200  milllikn into Tesla when it started at ten dollars a share they would have 16 billion now . It is time for large behemoths to set a different strategy. The goal is not to create an average product thst overtime will lose billions but to recognize quality and if necessary invest in the competition . The stubbornness of each corporation to over invest in trying to catch up to the competition is the not the real game that produces rewards for shareholders.

They had a very busy store in downtown Philadelphia, with no real competition, and yet it was closed. Now there is nowhere to get household items such as bedding, curtains, as well as reasonably priced clothing of good quality. Penney's is nearly the model of what a department store should be. The plundering mismanagement of the last few decades should not be allowed to destroy it. Give the creditors stock in the company so they are invested in its survival. We have no K-Mart, no Penney's, a joke of a Burlington store, a small Macy's with poor service and a copycat Century 21. Any serious shopping has to be done in malls far away or in Manhattan. I have to come to Manhattan to shop at Shoe Parlor. It's ridiculous. We also used to have two local department stores, both gone. What's wrong is the assumption that retail can't work.

Schumpeter's Creative destruction perfectly fits in to the collapse of former industrial giants such as Kodak and Xerox and the rise of Microsoft and Google, the outsourcing of call centers, cell phone manufacture, and many other jobs overseas, the rise of Fed Ex and other carriers to challenge the U.S. Postal Service, and now JC Penny.

2020-05-16 16:40:18,"There is going to be a lot of shopping center space sitting vacant after this C-19 thing shakes out. If the anchor store is a supermarket? Well, people need food. Maybe. I've seen newly-constructed shopping centers built around a supermarket that closed in six months. And the rest of the retail space sits idly by in a ghost venue. 

Holdovers from a previous age: Sears, Penny's, K-Mart. Some of them were leveraged-buyout out of business. The 'turnaround"" plan was to sell as much debt as anyone would buy - at an unsustainable level - and then take the business into bankruptcy after the hedge fund or private equity mob took a nice slice off the top. Completely legal...

Between the vulture-capitalism cannibalism and the internet, we are entering into a brave new world of retailing. (I think you've probably heard of Amazon.) We're not even sure the post office - under political assault - is going to be here next year. But that's a good distraction for a few months though, whatever happens. 

We're living in a short-term world filled with short-term people with temporary jobs, no healthcare, no savings, no retirement, and no rights. No protections. And retailing - as we know it - is looking a little short-term too. 

Short-term - from our divided government and corporate America - may be starting to look at little like ""shortsighted."""
2020-05-16 17:03:06,"My upbringing wasn’t steeped in the small town ethos where you walked into a store and you were instantly known, due to your good credit and associations in contributing to the town’s growth and survival.  When we moved back to my Dad’s birthplace and hometown, the first time an overly familiar voice identified my family relationships, I was taken aback.  It was as if the wind was knocked out of me.  The small town main streets were the thriving centers of middle class life before the large franchises came in (where they could, as many New England towns would not let them in for years.

By contrast, my grandmother worked for department stores as a bookkeeper and cashier for years.  Everyone knew her because she had earned her reputation for knowing when to remain distant; for handling money accurately and giving careful change; for reliability and discretion when she accidentally or purposefully learned inside information about influential people in St. Paul; and for being well-turned out and charming to boot.  

The main difference between these two models is that the first is based upon others’ lives, choices, achievements and failures.  The second was based upon my grandmother’s willingness to accept a small salary (grossly small) but to serve the local community as a sounding board; an uninvolved, yet empathetic shoulder; a bastion of honesty in dark times.  The failing big box stores’ lesson is that when owners are too distant from the producers/workers greed takes over."
2020-05-16 17:04:30,"J.C. Penney used to have a lot of catalogue stores in rural towns where you could order from the catalogue and pick up your items at the store.  Many of these were franchises. They could be found all over rural Ohio.  I worked with a young woman whose family was well off and sent her to Princeton University.  Her mother managed the catalogue store and her father managed a local insurance agency.  I just checked and there are still dozens of them and they are all ""temporarily closed"".  There are now Walmarts within driving distance of every one."

2020-05-16 17:19:04,"Neither JC Penney, Sears Roebuck, or Montgomery Wards adapted to the new internet connected economy. That's life. I don't miss them. They fulfilled an economic function fifty years ago.

The best part of these three was the huge catalogs they gave away for free. They made great reading material and toilet paper in the three holer outhouse that we used growing up in the distant past."
2020-05-16 17:21:58,"JCP can stick around a bit longer by consolidating their huge number of stores because they still offer some value to customers. 

What’s puzzling to me is how a big box like Burlington, many in dilapidated buildings like JCP, little online presence with a stock price of $167 per share and poor JCP is literally offered for pennies per share.

What is the secret sauce of a place like Burlington when Nieman, Nordstrom’s, Sax Fifth , Macy’s and poor JCP are suffering while A few of them are seemingly thriving?

Sure, places like Target, TJ Max and Walmart adapted to compete with the likes of Amazon but how has Burlington with almost zero online shopping done so well in this harsh survival of the fittest jungle in retail?"
2020-05-16 17:23:30,*shrug* These large department stores were the dinosaurs and COVID-19 was the asteroid. They failed to evolve to compete in a  world where goods will be largely bought and sold online. I haven't bought clothing in a physical store in years.
2020-05-16 17:29:02,"I don’t recall ever having shopped at JC Penney. Still, from what I read about their mangement, they could have done better. 

When I was young, I bought a lot of housewares at stores like that. By middle age, however, I was buying replacements and new things at Williams-Sonoma. 

Still, when the time came to outfit our children for college, back we went to the cheaper stores, as did all of our relatively well-off neighbors. 

Sometimes, the “statistics” used by upper management bear little relation to how goods are purchased and used. For obvious reasons, this puts brick-and-mortar at a huge disadvantage relative to online retail, and tends to magnify the effects of incomptence and nostalgia, not to mention wishful thinking in general."
2020-05-16 17:34:02,"The demise of JCP has been foreshadowed for a long time.  To avoid  the tedium of watching the company fall to pieces - like Sears -  I hope it goes into liquidation quickly.

A more interesting story might be the effect dying chains are having  on the companies that own the malls they have anchored - e.g. Simon Properties.

There have been rumors that Simon might be preparing to prop up Macy's, another dying department store chain. But it is unlikely that Simon can provide life support for all of its anchor tenants.

That could be a real problem for Simon and other mall owners because the leases of most of their smaller tenants include clauses allowing them to break their lease if an anchor tenant leaves."
2020-05-16 17:35:32,"As with the human deaths, COVID-related retail deaths are happening to the most vulnerable. It's still a tragedy. I miss those department stores, each with its own unique personality, that flourished in a more civilized time. I bet I'm not the only one who, after two months of shelter-in-place, would love to hit the mall and stroll through actual stores, touching actual merchandise before paying for it.

Funny thing, though: before the virus hit, or was made aware of, everyone said the malls were dying. Yet every time I went to one--which admittedly wasn't often, and usually on a Sunday--they seemed to be bustling, as difficult to park in as ever, and I'd think, Then who are all these people, ghosts?"

In it, I’m wandering around in the quiet, in a place bereft of anything I really want to purchase looking for someone to help me find something. However, no employee can be found in the giant silent space no matter how hard I search. Then it suddenly occurred to me that I’m just recalling the JCPenny that I remember for the last 5 decades."

And some have been mismanaged and milked for excess cash by private equity - that often leads to bankruptcy."
2020-05-16 18:05:34,"Putting the Penny's bankruptcy in perspective necessarily requires a little history. Here is a little perspective from Philadelphia.  Fifty years ago the follow were department stores on Market Street:

Strawbridge & Clothier
Gimbel's 
John Wanamaker
Lit Bros. 
F.W. Woolworth (not really a department store)

Do any exist today?  
 
Stores come and go.  Mostly, they go these days.  
The supplanted mall supplanted the downtown shopping experience decades ago, just as the internet is ending the mall era. 

The J. C. Penney bankruptcy is only notable given the firms longevity.  Certainly, management failed on a number of levels, but events simply outrunning these businesses. People don't shop the way they did 50 or 100 years ago.  This is the problem it will face when it exits Chapter 11."
2020-05-16 18:28:58,"What saddens me is not the number of retailers that will no longer exist within a few months. What saddens me is the amount of land we paved over to build more and more and more stores. My local JC Penney is in a shopping area that was build over a park that had trees and wildflowers and a creek. City leaders and developers said we needed the shopping center because my area was ""underserved."" At the time, I was within a 5-minute drive of two Target stores, a Walmart, a Sam's Club, at least half a dozen grocery stores, more than a dozen restaurants, a major mall and five other shopping centers with a variety of local stores and national chains. We're ""underserved"" all right, but in green space, not concrete."
2020-05-16 19:50:52,"The only way for these giant national retailers to survive in the 21st century is to become Amazon Part 2 - online only with a handful of brick and mortar locations that remain profitable. They need to escape the ridiculous rents they are paying shopping malls, and get out of debt.  Regarding those malls, as these physical stores close (large and small) they need to convert those spaces to affordable apartments which every city in this country desperately needs. Yes that will mean entering the real estate industry, but as this article points out, huge shopping malls are going the way of the Edsel. Computers are the new malls."
2020-05-16 20:03:43,"I believe JC Penneys can recapture it’s customers as more of us order online. It’s convenient, home delivery for a nominal fee, and quality merchandise. I didn’t care for the in store setup changes they made but I have continued to shop online. Our store started selling appliances after Sears closed its store, but I wonder how much business that brought in with Lowe’s and locally owned stores with the same product. We lost our Macy’s a few years ago but Kohl’s is still in business. I’ve continued to order from Macy’s online, but was never a fan of Kohl’s. In our area the loss of JC Penneys would be devastating in job loss and our mall would most likely close."

For as long as I can remember, JCP was always the last place on your list if you went there at all.   For many of us stuck at home, waiting to feel confident about going out to shop, the thought of a clean, smart retail store is tantalizing.  For those of us who can afford to spend some money, we are just waiting for that opportunity.  We can't go crazy, we can't buy $150 garments, but collectively we can make a dent in a store's bottom line if they will simply offer us well made goods at fair and reasonable prices.  And maybe hire employees who care about more than when their next break is scheduled, which about all you ever hear them talking about -- if you can find one."

However, the article fails to address the fact that unpaid ""domestic WORK"" has been foisted onto women and families by the rich to boost their profits by not having to include women's labor in wage calculations. The oppression of women is extremely profitable, not merely a character flaw in men. Much of the domestic drudgery could be organized along social-economic lines. Childcare, laundry, meal preparation, and cleaning can all be paid for by companies or provided for free by their government. It would cut into their abundant profits but that is of no concern to billions of women, and working families. The capitalists themselves perform none of this work, including the raising of their own children, who are raised by working women.

While foreigners may take time to learn the language and grow accustomed to the culture, in some ways it might help Japanese people to see that some aspects of current Japanese society, such as the salaryman, are not requirements for corporate success or survival. Work-life balance, a little more openness, and more equity in the home and in the workplace can enhance what Japan has to offer its citizens and the world.

I realized I prefer living on my own, both for my sanity and to preserve the peace with other people.

Of course families and married couples can’t do that; I’ve heard loud arguments from my normally quiet neighbor downstairs, presumably because her partner now sits around not doing much.

I recall a woman I met on a trip (who has since become a friend) telling me that she decided to go to work in addition to raising two daughters when her husband asked her “what she was doing all day”. He appeared to be the kind of modern man you wouldn’t have expected that kind of comment from, yet that’s what he thought. Out of sight, out of mind."

Fascinating to watch the culture evolve, next to the rest of the world .Japan has moved slowly in the country's view of women, but women have made advances, in business and politically. A lot of the old culture, respect for the old ways, the traditions, the place of businesses in society are gone in the younger generation,  A lot has changed, but this traditional male attitude in the home as described here, has not.

Even with no commute, sometimes I barely have time for lunch because of work. It takes concentration and it can be stressful. When I can take a break for half an hour, I want to relax and do nothing, before rushing back to a zoom meeting again. I can understand the frustration from women who have to be the ones doing more house chores, but it's about expectation between the two. I'm not a messy person and pretty clean, I'd do house chores when I can, but if the dishes have to sit in the sink for the whole day because I have a lot of meetings that day, or something else, the partner could help or I'd do it when I can. I have a close male friend whom his wife demands him to take care of the kids full time on the weekend, when he works really hard on weekdays, so that she can go out shopping or do what she wants on both Saturday and Sunday. She's a home maker and could manage her time to do that on weekdays. It's a different kind of exhaustion trying to make a living no matter what jobs you do. I've lived with some people that had different expectations and were trying to micro-manage me about house chores, when all I wanted to do was just sitting down relaxing in the place I paid for from my hard work, so both parties got resentful and it wouldn't work out anyway. Compatibility is the key, it's not about gender inequality."
2020-05-16 17:57:56,"Seems more about Japan's overall gendered work culture. I heard it's quite common for women to become housewives after marriage, and if the husband is working late into the night to provide for the family it's perfectly understandable that the wife does more household chores. Fair division of work. But this setup becomes gendered once being housewife becomes some sort of expectation; some companies are hesitant to hire or promote women because they think women will quit their careers midway. This hurts the prospects of women who actually want to develop a career. Women are not encouraged in their careers and more of them tend to choose the gendered path of becoming housewives. Vicious cycle there."
2020-05-16 18:03:51,"According to the OECD, Japanese men spend only 40 minutes per day performing unpaid work, compared with Japanese women who spend 224 minutes on unpaid work.  It’s hugely disparate, as the article suggests.  What’s also hugely disparate, however, is the amount of time spent on paid work in Japan, where men spend 452 minutes per day on paid work, compared with 272 minutes for Japanese women.  The result is that Japanese men spend 493 total minutes working each day, compared to 496 total minutes working each day for Japanese women, i.e. Japanese men and women perform the same total amount of total labor.   

While it’s valid to argue that Japan can and maybe should be more gender balanced when it comes to the division of paid and unpaid labor, Japanese men don’t exploit the household labor of Japanese women any more than Japanese women exploit the paid labor of Japanese men."

The patient was an east Indian man in his 40's, accompanied by his wife and sister who served as translator. He was a poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetic. As required for such patients, I asked if I could examine his feet. Without his asking, his wife then got up from her chair and  knelt down to take off her husband's socks and shoes After the exam, she again knelt down to put the socks and shoes back on. On subsequent visits with his brother in law as translator, this same patient easily reached down to his shoes and socks and removed them himself.

If people ask him if he helps he says the same thing...we had  both lived on our own for 20 years before we got married, once we did he did not assume he could stop doing all the things he did for himself for the last 20 years, laundry, cooking, cleaning, food shopping...it would have been ludicrous and unthinkable for either of us to assume I would start doing everything for him and he might occasionally ""help"" me.

2020-05-16 19:57:35,"Growing up in post-WWII family in Tokyo, this sounds familiar. Three decades ago when moving to CA and now in NY, I hoped distancing from the unjust patriarchy. 

My father, a former bureaucrat, was miserably incapable at home after retirement.  

Mother, full-time homemaker, encouraged me to learn all kinds of housework duties including cooking since the first grade before my big sister started igniting our old-fashioned cooking stove with matches. Every time I thanked mother, she always declined to admit that it was her accomplishment to raise her son as fully capable man at home. After all, she educated us well on this and other matters. I believe that it was her effort to make small changes and progress in this world. 

About a half year ago, when in the cashier line nearby Costco, pre-6-foot-distancing era, I noticed a customer before me was struggling to manage her pile of groceries. The line stagnated getting longer. I asked if I could help. Her eyes pointed to a man in front of her: her husband was there just standing. Without malicious intention, I asked him to help her out, so we all could finish shopping quickly. (a confession: my compulsive time efficiency.) To be my surprise, he said, “I pay.” “Me too.” My reflexive reply clearly aggravated the situation. I had no intention to offend him, but evidently, I did. He suddenly slowed down his payment process by laying currency and coins on the counter and shouted “I love USA. God bless America!” 
Here we go, again."

My wife and I share our house.  We live out in the middle of nowhere and have never been able to get a house cleaning service that is reliable, reasonably priced and does a decent job without damaging things.  The damaging things has been the biggest issue.  

So, I dust and vacuum, she does the bathrooms, we fix our own breakfast and lunch and she mostly does dinner because she likes to cook.

2020-05-16 18:08:00,"One thing that Americans may not be taking into account when thinking about housework is that the Japanese are FANATICAL about cleanliness to a degree we cannot really comprehend.  It is a religious/cultural normative about purity.  To put it into context, if you ever visit Tokyo, you will find temples WITH bathrooms on every block.  I have a friend from 7th grade who nearly disowned me when I had a little accident on a 4 mile walk.  This was when we were 50.  She can barely stand me any more.  Nothing we can joke about either.  So, when Americans talk about housework, I doubt it is hospital style disinfectant here."

2020-05-16 20:00:20,"Japan has faced a problem of women not wanting to get married.  With the burden of household task split like this,  largely on women, in addition to anything they might be doing outside of the home, why should they get married.  They face a choice of giving up on the idea of getting married at all or entering a marriage where they do all the work.  Better to stay single,  until things change.  Japanese society,  i.e. men must understand that."
2020-05-16 21:10:00,"Be careful with survey data on topics like this. A couple of decades ago, Arlie Hochschild wrote her famous book, ""The Second Shift"" that examined the gendered division of labor within the household. Ever the smart sociologist, she relied on both surveys AND participant observations. What she found was that white, college-educated men claimed to do the MOST amount of household work in surveys but did the LEAST when observed. In contrast, Latino men with high-school education said they did the least when, in fact, they did the most. Now, we can speculate about why this was the case, but surveys are very unreliable instruments for people's behavior. Otherwise, we wouldn't have jails or IRS tax auditors."

2020-05-16 22:59:45,"Obviously men should be doing more household work, but there's another aspect to this story that hasn't been fully explored, and that is the burdensome number of chores considered ""essential"" in these households.  Japanese women I know have reported to me that they feel societal pressure to do laundry daily, prepare elaborate lunches for their children, and perform other household tasks with great frequency.  Perhaps another way to relieve stress at home would be to pare down that list of more than 200 chores.  And then divvy it up fairly, of course!"

As several commenters have already point out, there's nothing wrong with a gendered division of labor. It becomes pernicious when husbands expect women to do all of the chores—because they are women—and when this expectation unduly holds women back from achieving what they'd like to achieve, personally or professionally. Clearly, in several of the cases profiled here, that is happening. And where that is the case, I'm happy to say that it's ""wrong""—whatever that means. I'm happy, in more theoretically lightweight language, to say that I disapprove of it.

But is it the government's place do to anything about it? If Japanese laws do not discriminate on the basis of sex and if economic incentives do not somehow attract more men to the workplace than women, then as far as I can see this is a purely personal, private matter, something to be resolved between a husband and a wife. Now, the government might run ad campaigns to promote certain outcomes, as might private companies, but, at a societal level, I'm not sure what else there is to be done. Perhaps the main upshot of this article is that it prompts reflection, reveals to some men that sometimes their expectations hurt their wives."

This is something I have experienced with my own husband, for more than 30 years. He is not one to sit around doing nothing (I would never tolerate that behavior), and I am not one to wait on people who are capable of doing for themselves. He does the chores that he wants to do (he is often “too busy” to do the ones he dislikes). But the drone thing sounds all too familiar. And the itemization of the 20 things he did to the 200 things she did: that, too, describes our lives. Why does Husband need to announce that he just swept the kitchen floor? Am I supposed to thank him for doing what I do every day? It’s not something extra. It’s not “help.” It’s called pitching in."

If Western feminists are angry at Japanese men for letting their wives do ""all the work"" .. Then let's cut to the chase and find out WHY Japanese men behave this way to begin with.. 

Eat a family meal in a Japanese house and observe when the 4 YO boy sitting at the table asks for ""More Rice"" it is the MOTHER, Grandmother or Sister who springs out of her seat and brings it to him. So at an early age it is the WOMAN who classically conditions the male child that women are there to serve.

Of course, I wash dishes and do a lot of the shopping, which helps while my wife is trying to recover from a heart condition.  She still insists on doing some shopping herself.  She once asked me to go pick up some instant ramen; I asked what brand, and she anything will do.  I returned home with the ramen, and she was miffed at my choice.  I reminded her that anything would do, and she replied anything but THIS one!

I came out of retirement last year to help out at my school, and all would have been fine until it was decided the spring-term teaching this year should be done at home using video conferencing.  I was in a quandary about having three or more 90-minute periods a day Monday through Friday in a small room in our small apartment.

2020-05-17 00:16:51,"The stark division of labor comes from the (not particularly historic) ""traditional"" set-up whereby Japanese men work outside the house and Japanese women (after marriage) do not. In that environment, it is usually equitable enough on a time basis for the non-working spouse to do the vast majority of the housework and child-rearing. Having lived for many years in Japan, I can tell you without hesitation that I'd much rather be a traditional non-working Japanese housewife than a traditional Japanese salaryman - no amount of chores comes close to matching the 12+ hour workdays and 2+ hour commutes Japanese salarymen endure.

However, in the last 30 years, that ""traditional"" model has broken down in a very lopsided way - married Japanese women now mostly work at least part-time outside the home, but there has been no commensurate reduction in male working hours. The result is that married Japanese women are generally stuck with the worst of both worlds - having to both work outside the home and shoulder the vast majority of domestic work, based on an out-of-date cultural contract.

This is clearly not sustainable, and the only realistic solution is to reduce the work expectations on Japanese men, so that they feel capable and morally obligated to pick up the domestic slack. There have been some very small steps in this direction, but not nearly enough, and the result is that women end up getting the short end of the stick."

But in reflection I realize that my then wife just had a different set of standards and that a pile of laundry, of her own clothes didn’t bother her. So why did it bother me so much and more importantly why was it so important for me to try and control the situation. Seriously, life is too short to fight over laundry.  

These days the situation is different.  My partner and I are both working professionals confined to home living in a cramped Tokyo apartment.  We both cook, take out the trash, do laundry, clean dishes, change the sheets. There are no lists - it gets done when one of us feels it needs to be done, ie if you see a full laundry basket it, pop it in. Full trash can, take it out. 

No discussion, lists, or assignments needed. Just common sense and consideration. It’s not hard if you care about the other person. And if you have a higher standard about something than the other person look inside before trying to force your will onto the other."

2020-05-17 05:07:23,"You nailed it, Aaron. While I enjoyed this article greatly, for me it missed the most important lesson to be learned. Who does most of the parenting in Japan? Mothers. From where do children learn that males don’t do housework? In their homes (where papa is away most of their waking hours). 
After living happily for now over 30 years in Japan, I still hear women complaining about their husbands/sons even as they rush around getting them beer, snacks, clearing dishes, readying pajamas and running the bath. Perhaps Ms Rich could focus less on the male vs. female angle, and consider the hidden cause of many gender problems here - mothers perpetuating unequal housework attitudes in future generations. Education truly starts in the home!"
2020-05-17 06:43:00,"I agree with Aaron and Bob that Japanese men are shaped by the women in their upbringing and in their adult lives (as well as forces outside their homes). I, a woman, lived in Japan for two years and observed the same. Aaron's observations can also be applied to Taiwan and probably a lot of cultures in the world. One look at the first photo in the article shows that this behavior continues into adulthood. Aki is putting up the laundry while her husband Susumu stands nearby doing what appears to be nothing. Is this better than updating his FB account?  A line out of a parenting book in the U.S. is ""whose problem is it?"" Aki could be asking him for help. If she's tired of asking, then stop doing his laundry and/or everyone in the family wear some clothes more than once. The national obsession with cleanliness in modern Japan does not help. In short, Ms. Rich could be probing deeper in this phenomenon."

2020-05-15 14:34:48,"I'm relieved that it turned out to be a good story. I was tense reading through it. Mr.Ravi (and his dear ones) had had some really bad days , but in the end , I'm happy to see that he's on the way to being his older self. Good days are ahead, young man ! Godspeed !"
2020-05-15 14:47:02,"This is really tragic, no doubt.  But I think this article is leaving out some important information.  If you look at the cited study, it looks like they only looked at 10 patients who had COVID-19 and strokes.  Additionally, 8 of those patients had preexisting conditions like diabetes and hypertension.  9 of those patients were racial minorities.  While this is disturbing, the sample size isn't particularly large and doesn't seem representative of all COVID-19 patients.  

It also seems like they cherry-picked patients who had strokes, rather than take a larger sample representative of all COVID-19 patients.  I think that would be more useful (out of 'x' number of all COVID-19 patients, this percentage had strokes).  

Overall, I don't think the potential link between COVID-19 and strokes is being covered responsibly by the media.  I get there's a lot we don't know about the virus, and that fully justifies social distancing until there's widespread access to a vaccine, articles like this do more to make people anxious than keep people informed."
2020-05-15 14:54:36,"Glad to hear you are improving Ravi!
I agree with the analogy of the coronavirus bus.
You can't imagine the impact unless you've felt it.
Stay safe, healthy and protect each other everyone."
2020-05-15 14:03:24,All the youngsters out there - the virus does not care how old you are!  Stay in!  You are not immune to the devastation caused by this virus.
2020-05-15 14:51:36,Glad you're better!  Thanks for sharing your story.
2020-05-15 14:17:49,Bina Yamin probably saved her brother's life by recognizing stroke symptoms over the phone. We should all have sisters like that. And too many of us will indeed need sisters and brothers like that to help us as the Republican-assisted epidemic rages through the population. Don't expect help from the rich; most of them are too busy profiting.
2020-05-15 15:46:31,We are learning much about the protean manifestations of this coronavirus. Let's hope that this serious complication in younger people will convince them to social distance and wear a mask.

Hi Anita
Agreed, it's not impossible for youngsters to be devastated by this virus.

But it's so unlikely that we should probably shouldn't consider it when we're making public decisions.

Decision-making should be based on populations, not individual anecdotes, though they are heartbreaking to hear about. 

Here in Connecticut there hasn't been a single Covid fatality in the 30 and under age population."
2020-05-15 20:17:18,"Sobering. I've had pulmonary emboli caused by a silent DVT in the past. Very scary. Don't know if this puts me at increased risk, but I'll assume so.

(I think the reporter is wrong in characterizing the DVT and pulmonary emboli as different kinds of clots. A DVT produces clots that can break off in the leg and travel to the lungs as mine did.)

Good that his sister recognized the stroke symptoms -- clots reaching the brain -- in this case, and he got treated in time."
2020-05-15 20:24:56,"Glad he recovered from the claws of COVID -- it's also a reminder especially for the south Asians who have rates of incidence of diabetes three times higher than among the white majority in Canada, and probably not much different in the US. Overall good health will also reflect in one's face, shoulders that and general bearing -- as reflected in the picture of his brother-in-law. Ravi as you already are exercising, take it more like a pleasant challenge to the next step. As a mid-seventy year old person, as I go out for my regular walk, rain, sun, or snow, I do my chin-ups on a tree branch as the building fitness room has been locked down. In fact I crave for my exercise, NOT because it's good for health, which it is, but because it's enjoyable. For this reason, I have always been reasonably active and rarely see doctors. As another article in NYTimes of May 14 tells the story of a 108-year old woman who survived COVID because, I believe, she was also ""inquisitive"" and into ""smart talking."" Take care Ravi!"
2020-05-15 20:52:17,"Anecdotes aren’t great, but if they lead people/scientists to identify the right kinds of data to collect routinely, they do serve a purpose."
2020-05-15 23:31:16,"It’s a novel virus.  No one has been exposed to it before.  Maybe.  As some asymptomatic.  I’m old, my husband has asthma.   We’re not going anywhere soon."
2020-05-16 01:10:31,"More likely he had an underlying condition that he didn't know about. People don't have strokes no reason. There's always an underlying condition associated with them, usually more.

Even though he claimed to work out the loss of 50 pounds of weight is substantial and seems to indicate morbid obesity prior to this stroke.

So don't go flying off the handle believing everyone is having strokes because of this thing because they're not, not even close."
2020-05-16 01:18:15,"To Ravi and family, especially Bina who took notes and helped get this story to the NYT, best wishes and thank you.

We are still learning.  Pre-internet, this meager amount of information might have taken a year or more to compile.  

Much of the information we are getting is from papers and studies that have not gone though the usual peer-review process, and invariably some of it will have small samples, untested theories, and some of it will be downright wrong in the end.  Even in the internet age, peer review for publication is a slow process.  

Releasing this sort of preliminary information allows a wide medical collaboration and (hopefully) faster vetting of theories, hopefully saving lives along the way.  Maybe it won't matter to you.  Maybe it'll be someone close to you in the ER, alone and scared.  But just maybe this isn't about you - this is about all of us."
2020-05-15 16:18:55,"Great to know that Ravi is making great progress. I wish him speedy and complete recovery.

I wonder if we had been fed much misinformation about the virus from the beginning: that it mostly affected the elderly or people with underlying health conditions. We had also been told that there was only a 1-2% fatality rate from it and that most people only experienced minor symptoms. Facts have proven out to be otherwise.

Also remember that Americans initially were not required to wear a mask. The head of China's equivalent of our CDC considered not requiring Americans to wear a mask to be a ""big mistake."" Time proved him right. Countless American lives could have been saved through this simple act.

Future generations would look back at this and would wonder in amazement how the virus was almost given a free rein in America due to human folly, incompetence and arrogance."
2020-05-15 18:10:30,"Thank you for sharing this story. I am moved by the stalwart faith of his Sister and family. I was also moved to happy tears. 
I wish a long and healthy life for this Healthcare Hero (who obviously was not properly equipped for the job) and those he loves. 
What a horrific ordeal that could have been prevented, had we responsible ’leaders’ in this country. Professional people like him have been callously thrown under the bus by policy, greed and simple incompetence. 
If he and his lovely girlfriend later marry, I’d love to see a story about that too!"
2020-05-16 03:03:40,"It's enraging that so many ""I'm an American -- no one tells me what to do!"" types are going to endanger a huge number of healthcare workers by refusing to practice social distancing, refusing to wear a mask, and agitating for the premature opening of potential hotspots. Can't stop thinking about those covidiots at bars in Wisconsin -- no masks, no social d.

I'm very glad that Mr. Sharma is on the mend; without  minimizing what he has been through and the continued rehab, I look forward to his having a long, healthy life. Best wishes to him, his family, his gf, his colleagues, and the healthcare workers who have been working to restore his health.

This article should be required reading. Thanks, Ms. Rabin."
2020-05-15 22:43:42,We all die in the end.
2020-05-16 00:13:19,"Another tear jerker with a somewhat optimistic ending.  A careful and slow but steady recovery is expected.  However, too many younger people continue to think they are indestructible.  They regard their possible exposure, contraction, and course of infection and treatment regimen with nonchalance and disdain.  ""Oh it's like the flu or I'll only get mild symptoms because I don't have any pre-existing conditions that put me at risk."" Such airy thinking similar to the continued dismissal of the crisis by the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW is a danger to us all.  Fortunate for this young man his sister recognized the seriousness of his stroke. The father fearing for his son's life took appropriate action which saved his life.  Please NYTimes continue to report these real life stories from young people.  So that these stories will be circulated on facebook, twitter, linkedin, snapchat, instagram, whatsapp, qzone, tumblr, tik tok, and other social media platforms where younger people congregate, learn, and become informed worldwide as a link. In closing, this story and others should be distributed to as wide an audience as possible to show that Covid-19 is a game changer and must be respected as such, if any of us are to survive successive waves of infection."
2020-05-15 21:00:18,African Americans need to take vitamin D.  It's been a known benefit to avoid a more serious illness.  I don't understand why this isn't more publicized.
